Another Nigger in the Morgue Lyrics
Let me get down when I rock the— the— the—
The shit ain't got no fuckin drums in it, man
Damn, why don't you put some fuckin drums in the music?
So I can

Get down to business
I think it's time I paid a little visit
To my run-down neighborhood cemetery
To tally up the people I've buried
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight, fifty-nine
All layin' down in the same line
You sorry motherfuckers couldn't handle me
I done fucked up seventeen families
So bring it on if you wanna play, huh
Make my motherfuckin' day
'Cause you'll be one dead motherfucker, Black
I'ma put your ass on your back
I won't play no games with ya, boy
You'll just be one more nigga in the morgue

Yeah, I like that, man, that shit sound kinda funky, don't it?
Hahahaha, yo, let me finish this freestyle though, man
Hold 'em down, hold 'em up, yo
It's gonna be a killin' after midnight
Niggas gettin' ready for the big fight
You could say this one's a murder by a lunatic
M11 on your ass, bitch
Loadin' up my weapons, gettin' ready for
Another street-sweepin' neighborhood drug war
Police come around in a meat wagon
Knowin' that tonight they'll be draggin'
Off motherfuckers to a six-foot ditch
I hope your insurance paid up, bitch
'Cause tonight is the night, motherfucker
Be a good killer or a damn good ducker
'Cause if you ain't, your ass is fallin' to the paint
Bloodshed seems to make a nigga faint
Not me with a .9 in my hand
I could fall asleep lyin' next to a dead man
You gotta understand me
It's been a vet sorry motherfucker layin' out dead, see
So if you wanna come, come hard
Or you'll be another nigga in the morgue

Yeah, you motherfuckers
You motherfuckers goin' for bad and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
But you'll be another nigga in the morgue, motherfucker
Oh, yo, check this out
But gettin' back to the bloodbath
You motherfuckers out there go for bad
That shit played out, my brother
I ride by and gun down motherfuckers
Whether friend or foe, bro
Steppin' on my toes, your ass has gotta go
Now here's how the shit took place (How'd it go?)
A nigga waved a trey-eight in my face (Damn)
Screamin' that shit about the Squab Mob
Talkin' big shit about the South Park
Said he's gonna stop me
Pissed off cause I'm down with the 5th Ward posse (Mhm)
The shit didn't make me none
I ain't scared of no goddamn gun (My nigga)
Once I saw a break, I snuck 'em
What about his three boys, man? Fuck 'em
I'll put it on his ass 'cause he's bigger
Then worry about the other three niggas
All of them ran to get backup
That's twelve more niggas I'ma stack up
Opened up the trunk in a rage
And loaded up my goddamn twelve gauge
If the punk don't keep ya
I'll be forced to hit ya with the street sweeper
Your ass shouldn't a started no static, G
Twelve gunshots automatically
I ain't goin' out like no sucker
I'm goin' out like a crazy motherfucker
Everybody knows that I ain't got it all
And I don't give a fuck about none of y'all
Hit three or four in the head
That's three or four niggas left for dead
It doesn't pay to check cards
'Cause I'm sendin' motherfuckers to the morgue (Morgue)3Embed
