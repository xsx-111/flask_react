Punk-Bitch Game Lyrics{*live audience screaming*}

Ladies, ladies! If you ain't no bitch, don't like to be called bitch
Put your hands up like this HERRRRRRRRE
Yo, on the count of three, here's what I want y'all to say for me
Don't call me biiiiiiiiiitch, PUNK! One, two, three
(Don't call me biiiiiiiiiitch, PUNK!)
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhh

Ahh the ladies are in the house

Uh-ohhhhhhhhhh

DO THE FELLAS RUN THIS MOTHERFUCKER~!
I know they do, so check this out
Fellas, at the count of one two three
Let me hear you repeat after me
Don't call me puuuuuuuuuuunk, BITCH! One, two, three
(Don't call me puuuuuuuuuuunk, BITCH!)

Ladies I know y'all ain't goin out like that right? (Noooo!)
On the count of one-two-three, one, two, three!
