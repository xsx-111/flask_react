The Have Nots LyricsDrink at the bar nothin' bar anything
But the bottom step of the ladder
It keeps gettin' higher and higher

Dawn comes soon enough for the working class
It keeps gettin' sooner or later
This is the game that moves as you play
How does it feel to have your own bottle of booze?
Behind the bar, how does it feel?
To play cards with the barmaids while they work
At Jocko's Rocket Ship or the One Eye Jack
My Sin and The Lucky Star
A steady place to study and drink

Dawn comes soon enough for the working class
It keeps gettin' sooner or later
This is the game that moves as you play

Day old days
Ancient Bloody Mary bastards in a hardcore blue collar bar
Here we sit
A shot and a beer after another hard earned day

Day old days
Ancient Bloody Mary bastards in a hardcore blue collar bar
Here we sit
A shot and a beer after another hard earned day

Dawn comes soon enough for the working class
It keeps gettin' sooner or later
This is the game that moves as you play
At the Hi-d-Hi and the Hula Gal
A Bee-Hive Bar and the Zircon Lounge
G.G.'s Cozy Corner, the Gift of Love
Stop & Drink, Sit & Sip, Rest In Pieces
Dexter's New Approach and the Get Down Lounge
The Aorta Bar -- Detroit's main vein

Dawn comes soon enough for the working class
It keeps gettin' sooner or later
This is the game that moves as you play
