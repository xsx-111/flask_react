Come Back to Me Lyrics
Gifts and flowers lay upon the lid
Of pink silk above your face
Tears make a river of diamonds in the dark
Our daddy breaks down at the funeral home

Flies and relations make an annoying sound
We sit or wander round the room
Ribbons are folded on the rose bouquet
And I hear a voice that sounds so much like yours

Please, please come back to me
I cry and talk to you
Through the bathroom wall
Oh please come back to me

Playing in Cleveland on a Wednesday night
Recovering from the night before
I'm broken and crying in the ladies' room
The opening band is banging out their song

Please, please come back to me
I cry and talk to you
Through the bathroom wall
Oh please come back to me
I made a shrine for you on the kitchen wall
With flowers and Florida souvenirs
You were walking through the house last night
I knew it was you from the space in your steps

Please, please come back to me
I cry and talk to you
Through the bathroom wall
Oh please come back to meEmbed
