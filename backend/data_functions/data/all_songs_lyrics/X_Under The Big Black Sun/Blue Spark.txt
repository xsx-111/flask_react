Blue Spark Lyrics
Blue spark
He waits in a beach apartment
Blue spark
Thousands of lights, thousands of people
She's forgotten him for the bodies around her

Blue shock
Exchange
Blue shock
Exchange

Blue spark
What goes between the eyes downtown?
Blue spark
Oh, loudspeakers and search lights, the boulevard
She comes home later just to give him

Blue shock
Exchange
Blue shock
Exchange
Blue spark
Blue spark
