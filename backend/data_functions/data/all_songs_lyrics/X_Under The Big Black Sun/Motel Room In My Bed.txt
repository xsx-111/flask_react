Motel Room In My Bed Lyrics
Put the doorknob on my side
If you don't mind, I don't care
Put the doorknob on my side
It's self-locking, give me your key

I go to bed soggy and forgetful
Hopefully not waking up so fitfully

I like coffee and I like tea
I like a pretty boy and he likes me
Put the doorknob on my side
It's self-locking, give me your key

I go to bed soggy and forgetful
Hopefully not waking up so fitfully

Motels do that with rubber sheets
So I can't sleep staring at my sheets
Or crying on my sheets
Or bleeding on the same
Put the doorknob on my side
If you don't mind, I don't care
A motel room in my bed
Put both door knobs on my side

I go to bed soggy and forgetful
Hopefully not waking up so fitfully

Motels do that with rubber sheets
So I can't sleep staring at my sheets
Or crying on my sheets
Or bleeding on the sameEmbed
