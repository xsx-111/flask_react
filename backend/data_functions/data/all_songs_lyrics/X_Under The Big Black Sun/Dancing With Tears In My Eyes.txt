Dancing With Tears In My Eyes LyricsDancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my arms are calling to
Dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my arms are calling to
I'm trying to smile once in a while
But I found
It wouldn't do
Dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my arms are calling to
I'm trying to smile once in a while
But I found
It wouldn't do
Dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't youEmbed
