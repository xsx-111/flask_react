How I (Learned My Lesson) LyricsHow I (how I)
How I (how I)
Learned my lesson
How I (how I)
How I (how I)
Learned my lesson
Mine is a big pink house
A preacher knocking on the door
With a self-righteous preacher going in
But he is just an old flame
I'll never want him again and again and again
How I (how I)
How I (how I)
Learned my lesson
How I (how I)
How I (how I)
Learned my lesson
I didn't, I kept on trying
I didn't listen I looked up to you
How I (how I)
How I (how I)
Learned my lesson
I call you on the phone
But you tell me you're not home
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
So I never want to see you again
I'm wrecking the kitchen carefully
But I'm keeping your dinner warm
How I (how I)
How I (how I)
Learned my lesson
How I (how I)
How I (how I)
Learned my lesson
I didn't, I kept on trying
I didn't listen, I looked up to you
How I (how I)
How I (how I)
Learned my lesson
At the soul market on Sunday
Here's what I put in your collection basket
In front of the congregation
I stood up and called your name
When I walked out
You just shook my hand
How I (how I)
How I (how I)
Learned my lesson
How I (how I)
How I (how I)
Learned my lessonEmbed
