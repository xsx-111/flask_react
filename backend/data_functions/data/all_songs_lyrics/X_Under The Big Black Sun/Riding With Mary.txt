Riding With Mary LyricsThey can't go to sleep at four
The car is parked outside the door
Scars of a knife on his arm
Her husband knows they're together
Riding with Mary
Protection to pass
Riding with Mary
Protecting immaculate love
Rows of numbered doors behind
The car warms up, the street is clear
Clear and empty and green with lights
They talk and never stop moving
Riding with Mary
Protection to pass
Riding with Mary
Protecting immaculate love
He's sounding her name in his head
She's falling asleep next to his face
Her sister's getting married today
And the saints of Easter smile
Riding with Mary
Protection to pass
Riding with Mary
Protecting immaculate love
On the dashboard rides a figurine
It's a powerless sweet forgotten thing
So the next time you see a statue of Mary
Remember my sister was in a car
Riding with Mary
Protection to pass
Riding with Mary
Protecting immaculate love
Riding with Mary
Protection to pass
Riding with Mary
Protecting immaculate loveEmbed
