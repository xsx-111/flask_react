Snow Is Gone LyricsBirds beneath my window
Dusting their wings upon the lawn
I hear them in the morning light
Giving last amen to a migratory song
They're never looking round for me
Their eyes are on the sky or the ground below
But I'd rather be the one who loves
Than to be loved and never even know

Hello, blackbird
Hello, starling
Winter's over
Be my darling
Long time coming, but now
The snow is gone
Long time coming, but now
The snow is gone
You were beautiful when I first saw
Your feathers and confectionery airs
The Earth, it up and promised you the stars
But you really didn't care
I sang in exultation, I pulled the stops
You always looked a little bored
But I'm singing for the love of it
Have mercy on the man who sings to be adored

I'm underneath your window now
It's long after the birds have gone to roost
And I'm not sure if I'm singing for the love of it
Or for the love of you
But I've flown a long way, honey, oh
Hear my confession, then I'll go
I'd rather be the one who loves
Than to be loved and never even know
Hello, brown one
Hello, blue one
Last night's feathers
Exchanged for new ones

Long time coming, but now
The snow is gone
The snow is goneEmbed
