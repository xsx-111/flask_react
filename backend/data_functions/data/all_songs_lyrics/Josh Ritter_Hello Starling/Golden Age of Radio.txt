Golden Age of Radio Lyrics
Picture they took of you in your cowboy hat
Makes you look like you are one of the boys
Out on a Saturday night
Meanwhile on the outskirts of the dance hall
I’m a joke that you’d probably enjoy
On the outside of Memphis, all the buildings look big
And the white picket fences all dare to charge around the lawn
And hold their heads up high when my headlights find them out
They’ll be the first to put their hands in the air with my radio on
Oh, singing a country song, soft and low

So, living on the edge of the city limit lines
This is where the boundary finally ends
And I swear that we’re the last living souls
In a populated ghost town
All the billboards are our best friends
Oh, which way did our last chance go and can we
Get out if we go right now?
'Cause it seems that with the malls and the megachurch stadiums
We would get out if we knew just how with the radio on

Oh, singing a country song, soft and low
Ooh, when I’ve got a worried mind, I know
I hear the ghost of Patsy Cline
On the Grand Old Opry Show
Standing in line to get my self-help book signed off
On by the reverend who shouts to the converted
Have mercy on this boy, he did it all by the book
But still kind of has his doubts
Yeah, you look pretty good in that jonquil dress
But your smile is a wooden nickel’s pride
And I know that it ain’t worth much but it feels good to touch
And I think that I could dance if I tried with your radio on
