Kathleen LyricsAll the other girls here are stars, you are the Northern Lights
They try to shine in through your curtain, you’re too close and too bright
They try and they try, but everything that they do
Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you
I’ll be the one to drive you back home, Kathleen
This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile
Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line
You act like you’re hip to their tricks and you’re strong
But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song
I’ll be the one to drive you back home, Kathleen
And I’ll have you back by break of day
I’m going your way anyway
If you’d like to come along
I’ll be yours for a song, oh, oh
Well, I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me
But I’m here and I’m ready and I saved you the passenger seat
And I won’t be your last dance, just your last goodnight
Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied
I’ll be the one to drive you back home, Kathleen, yeah
Crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room
And I’ll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon
And the next time we meet, a new kind of hello
Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know
About the night that I drove you back home, Kathleen
I drove you home
I drove you home
Drove you homeEmbed
