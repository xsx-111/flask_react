California LyricsGoing out to California
Going to let the water warm my clothes
I’m alone, but I’m not lonely
Going to trade the weather for the Western Coast
Oh, don’t cry
I’ll be back and I’ll
Bring the sun to shine
In your eyes
On your shoulders
Sunset Boulevard will strip for money
And Mulholland is a long drag for the lonely hearts
And down along Imperial Valley
Runs a river of homelessness and cinema stars
Don’t say
The trip’s been done
A hundred thousand times
Cause this one
Is mine
So I will work at what work finds me
And I will take what comfort, oh, I can get
And I’ll be back when I’m good and ready
California doesn’t seem to think I’m ready yet
It's all right
I’ll be back and I’ll
Bring the sun to shine
In your eyes
On your shouldersEmbed
