Wings LyricsAt night we crossed the border
Following a black robe
To the edge of the reservation
To Cataldo Mission
Where the saints and all the martyrs
Look down on dying converts
What makes the water holy she says is that
It’s the closest thing to rain
I stole a mule from Anthony
I helped Anne up upon it
And we rode to Coeur d’Alene
Past Harrison and Wallace
They were blasting out the tunnels
Making way for the light of learning
When Jesus comes a-calling
She said he’s coming round the mountain on a train

Yeah, yeah
It’s my home
Last night I dreamt that I grew wings
I found a place
Where they could hear me when I sing
We floated on to Hanford
On a lumber boat up river
Past the fisheries and the milltowns
Like a stretch of future graveyards
She was driven to distraction
Said I wonder what will happen
When they find out they’re mistaken
And the land is too changed to ever change
We waded through the marketplace
Someone’s ship had come in
There was silver and begonias
Dynamite and cattle
There were hearts as big as apples
And apples in the shape of Mary’s heart
I said inside this gilded cage
A songbird always looks so plain

And so they came with cameras
Breaking through the morning mist
Press and businessmen, tycoons
Episcopal philanthropists
Lost in their appraisal
Of the body of a woman
But all we saw were lowlands
Clouds clung to mountains without strings
At last we saw some people
At last we saw some people
At last we saw some people
Huddled up against
The rain that was descending
Like railroad spikes and hammers
They were headed for the border
Walking and then running
And then they were gone into the fog
But Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wingsEmbed
