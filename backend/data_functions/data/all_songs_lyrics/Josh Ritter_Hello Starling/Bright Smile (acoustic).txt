Bright Smile (acoustic) LyricsNow my work is done
I feel I'm owed some joy
Oh Imogene and Abelard
I'm your homeward boy
But there's another one
Who brings me to your door
And the boat she weaved from the tidal reeds
Was always tied to shore
With bright smiles and dark eyes
Bright smile dark eyes
Everywhere I went, oh
I was always looking for ya
Bright smile dark eyes
I'm looking for some peace
But it's so hard to find
With Calamity Janes and the Steamboat Casanovas
And Darling Clementines
If she's your only one
Then she is also mine
Just pin your heartbeat up against my heartbeat
And you'll see how well we rhyme
With bright smiles and dark eyes
Bright smile dark eyes
Everywhere I went, oh
I was always looking for ya
Bright smile dark eyes
Man is only half himself
The other half is a bright thing
He tumbles on by luck or grace
For man is ever a blind thing
Bright smiles and dark eyes
Bright smile dark eyes
Everywhere I went, oh
I was always looking for ya
Bright smile dark eyesEmbed
