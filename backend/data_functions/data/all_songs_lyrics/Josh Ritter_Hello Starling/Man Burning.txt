Man Burning Lyrics
Don’t stand too close to me
Don’t be another tragedy
I’ve burned everybody who had a hand to lend
A man burning at both ends
No one put me in this hell
I lit a fire underneath myself
Now I’m blazing the same old trail back to you again
A man burning at both ends

A dangerous thing to know about
No painless way to put me out
You either make a bed that’s cold
You’re walking barefoot over coals

I regret the things I’ve done
Bitter words and fiery tongues
And letters turned to smoke and then turned to wind
A man burning at both ends


We ran barefoot through the reeds
Wetted down and with the need
The tide was high and getting higher
Could not put out the man on fire
Look, look, look, look, look down your street for me
Look, look, look, look, look up your the window please
You’ll see a light where before no light had been
A man burning at both ends
You’ll see a light where before no light had been
A man burning at both endsEmbed
