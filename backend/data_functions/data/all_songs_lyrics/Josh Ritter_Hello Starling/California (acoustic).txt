California (acoustic) LyricsCalifornia
Going out to California
Gonna let the water warm my clothes
I'm alone but I'm not lonely
Gonna trade the weather for the Western coast
No don't cry
I'll be back and I'll
Bring the sun to shine
In your eyes
On your shoulders
Sunset Boulevard will strip for money
Mulholland is a long drag for the lonely hearts
Down along the Imperial Valley
Runs a river of homelessness and cinema stars
Don't say
The trip's been done
A hundred thousand times
Cause this one
Is mine
So I will work at what work finds me
And I will take what comfort I can get
I'll be back when I'm good and ready
California doesn't seem to think I'm ready yet
No don't cry
I'll be back and I'll
Bring the sun to shine
In your eyes
On your shouldersEmbed
