Snow Is Gone (acoustic) LyricsBirds beneath my window dustying their wings upon the lawn
I hear them in the morning light giving last amen to a migratory song
They're never looking round for me their eyes are on the sky or the ground below
But I'd rather be the one who loves than to be loved and never even know
Hello blackbird, hello starling
Winter's over, be my darling
It's been a long time coming
But now the snow is gone
You were beautiful when I first saw your feathers and confectionery airs
Like the earth, it up and promised you the stars but you really didn't care
I sang in exultation pulled the stops - you always looked a little bored
But I'm singing for the love of it - have mercy on the man who sings to be adored
Hello blackbird, hello starling
Winter's over, be my darling
It's been a long time coming
But now the snow is gone
I'm underneath your window now - it's long after the birds have gone to roost
And I'm not sure if I'm singing for the love of it or for the love of you
But I've flown a long way honey hear my confession then I'll go
I'd rather be the one who loves than to be loved and never even know
Hello brown one, hello blue one
Last night's feathers exchanged for new ones
Hello blackbird, hello starling
Winter's over, be my darling
It's been a long time coming
But now the snow is goneEmbed
