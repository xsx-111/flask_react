Oh How Your Love Is Strong Lyrics
Hey girl, oh how your love is strong
Weaves a tumble-in' tearless song
Tho' you don't seem to care that you love is blind
You don't seem to care nor realise

Hey girl, oh how my heart is torn
Hey girl, now that your baby's born
What shall it cost? Is my freedom lost?
What is the price of nature's own way

Hey girl, how could I dress your child
When this life girl I'm livin' so wild?
Will your newborn child grow to be as wild?
And walk alone to meet his destiny?

Hey girl, see how I stand a man
Hey girl, see I've no father's hand
Would it be a crime to leave at such a time
When you've many claims to make on me?

Hey girl, oh how your love is strong
Weaves a tumble-in' tearless song
Tho' you don't seem to care that you love is blind
You don't seem to care nor realiseEmbed
