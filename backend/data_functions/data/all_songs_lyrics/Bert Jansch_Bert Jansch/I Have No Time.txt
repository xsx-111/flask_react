I Have No Time Lyrics
I have no time to spend with you
You talk of nothing, what can you do?
You live like kings and you know it's true
That if famine crossed the waters that'd be the end of you

I've heard of people who till the earth
Who sow their seeds for what they're worth
Who cry for rain all summer long
And weep for the day when winter's passed and gone

If cherry trees bore fruit of gold
The birds would die, their wings would fold
They'd sing no more their song of love
Nor await the morning sun that lights the sky above

If war returns like it did before
A kiddy's penny would be no more
They'd cry for love and their candy too
But a kiddy's wants are nothing 'till killin' days are thru'

So drink your fill, be happy now
The times will change and you'll wonder how
A man could die from lack of food
But you don't give a damn, no reason why you shouldEmbed
