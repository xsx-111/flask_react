Courting Blues Lyrics
Green are your eyes
In the morning, when you arise
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know

Love can be broken
Though no words are spoken
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know

Love don't cry
I'll not try
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know

Love be bold
We're not so old
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know
Green are your eyes
In the morning, when you rise
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will be told someday
About our wedding day(?)Embed
