Dreams of Love Lyrics
A troubled wind has chilled my heart
Killed our love right from the start
And visions of your face
Twist in my mind into knots of silken lace
A chance to win a hand so fair
Fades with night and a single prayer
Then a straw hat on her head
Brings morning dreams to alight upon my bed
If dead men swam the waters deep
Then fish would cry all in their sleep
My love, I can only try
To lift my hat from the depths as you walk by
Now banjos ring and fiddles play
A candle burns to light my way
And turning in my sleep
I dream again of your love, your love to keepEmbed
