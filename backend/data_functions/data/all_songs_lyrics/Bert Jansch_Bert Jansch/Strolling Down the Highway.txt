Strolling Down the Highway Lyrics
Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna to get there my way
Dusk 'till dawn I'm walking
Can you hear my guitar rockin'?

While I stroll on down
On down the highway

People think I'm a crazy
But lord above ain't lazy
The sun shines all day long
The garlic's far too strong

While I stroll on down
On down the highway

While I stroll on down
On down the highway

The cars won't stop for no one
They'd all think your just a rollin' bum
They think you are a spy
Gonna shoot them as a they go by
No, the cars they won't stop
Won't stop for no one

Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna to get there my way
Dusk 'till dawn I'm walking
Can you hear my guitar rockin'?

While I stroll on down
On down the highwayEmbed
