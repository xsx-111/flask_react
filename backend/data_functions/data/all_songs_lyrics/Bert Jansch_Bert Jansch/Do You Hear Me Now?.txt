Do You Hear Me Now? Lyrics
Freedom fighters speak with your tongues
Sing with the might of the wind
In your lungs, do you hear me now?

My mama told me, papa said it too
Son, the world's divided and you know
Your cause is true, do you hear me now?

Can you see those mushrooms seed and burst
Spreading through our valleys breeding hunger
Breeding thirst
Do you hear me now?

Snowing in the winter, blossoms in the spring
If they drop the bomb in the summertime
It don't mean a dog-gone thing
Do you hear me now?
Do you hear me now?

Freedom fighters speak with your tongues
Sing with the might of the wind
In your lungs, do you hear me now?
Do you hear me now?Embed
