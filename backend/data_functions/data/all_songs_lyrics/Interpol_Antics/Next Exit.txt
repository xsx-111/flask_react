Next Exit Lyrics
We ain't goin' to the town
We're goin' to the city
Gonna track this shit around
And make this place a heart
To be a part of
We ain't goin' to the town
We're goin' to the city
Gonna track this shit around
And make this place a heart
To be a part of again

Goin'
We're goin'
We're goin'
And we're gone
We're goin'
We're goin'
Goin'
We're gone

So, baby, make it with me in preparation for tonight
We've got so much to leave but that's not what makes this right
You've been building up steam, ignited by this fight
So do this thing with me instead of tying on a tight one tonight
Goin'
Goin'
Goin'
And we're gone

We ain't goin' to the town
We're goin' to the city
Gonna track this shit around
And make this place a heart
To be a part of again2Embed
