Length of Love Lyrics
This could be destiny
Oh, sweetheart
I've had no sense of time
Since we started
I've got friends in need
Oh, sweetheart
I've grown lengths and lengths
And lengths of love
Since we started this thing out

Combat salacious removal
Combat salacious removal

There is a bitter breed
Oh, sweetheart
They will be watching you sometimes
With their bitter hearts
But we are through with these
Oh, we're shifting the heartache
We want strong summer love
The most robust of blood
Just to stay awake
Combat salacious removal
Combat salacious removal
Combat salacious removal2Embed
