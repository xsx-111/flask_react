Drop The Hate LyricsTonight, we not only speak, to the members of the greater Jerusalem baptist church
We not only speak, to baptist people tonight
We not only speak to, the methodist people tonight
Church of God and right
Catholic, and no particular denomination
No particular city
But tonight we speak to the whole nation
Tonight, our message
Drop the hate, forgive each other
Drop the hate
Drop the hate, forgive each other
Drop the hate
Drop the hate, forgive each other
Drop the hate
Drop the hate, forgive each other
Drop the hate
Drop the hate
I'm calling on heaven and me
To join hands tonight, oh Lord
Let's join hands
And walk together, oh yeah
And I'm leading it tonight
Yeah I'm leading it tonight
Yeah I'm leading it tonight
Let's all join hands
Drop the hate, forgive each other
Drop the hate
Drop the hate, forgive each other
Drop the hate...Embed
