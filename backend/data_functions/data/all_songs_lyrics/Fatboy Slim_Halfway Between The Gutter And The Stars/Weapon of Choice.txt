Weapon of Choice Lyrics
Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice
Check out my new weapon, weapon of choice
Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice
Check out my new weapon, weapon of choice

Listen to the sound of my voice
You can check it on out, it's the weapon of choice, yeah
Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice
It's the new weapon, the weapon of choice, yeah

You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
Or you can blow with us
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with
Walk without rhythm
It won't attract the worm
Walk without rhythm
And it won't attract the worm
Walk without rhythm
And it won't attract the worm
If you walk without rhythm
Ah, you never learn, yeah

Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice
Check out my new weapon, weapon of choice
Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice
Check out my new weapon, weapon of choice

Be careful, we don't know them
Be careful, we don't know them
Be careful, we don't know them
Be careful, we don't know them

You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
Or you can blow with us
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with
Organically grown, through the hemisphere I roam
To make love to the angels of light
Yeah, and my girl
I guess you just don't understand
It's gone beyond being a man
As I drift off into the night, I'm in flight
She's a boy scout, no doubt
But I'm gonna hold my cool, 'cause the music rules
Yeah, so move on, baby, check out
Halfway between the gutter and the stars, yeah
Halfway between the gutter and the stars, yeah

You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
Or you can blow with us
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with this
Or you can blow with that
You can blow with3Embed
