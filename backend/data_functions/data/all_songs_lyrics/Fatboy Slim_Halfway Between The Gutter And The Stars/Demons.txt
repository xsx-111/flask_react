Demons Lyrics
They say she had a heart attack
I think the creature's coming back
And I am fine 'cause all my love's electrifying

And I'm comfy like a cesspool
Wanna be with you
And it's my premonition
I better give my heart a listen
And my preacher said

All of your demons will wither away
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay
You'll understand when you come my way
'Cause all of my demons have withered away

They said he shook himself to death
I wanna dance 'til my last breath
But mister disco only parties hard in Frisco

Comfy like a cesspool
Wanna be with you
And it's my premonition
I better give my heart a listen
And my preacher say
All of your demons will wither away
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay
You'll understand when you come my way
'Cause all of my demons have withered away2Embed
