Shine Lyrics
Lord, don't remember my sins
My sins from my youth
Don't remember my sins
And father, please elude my transgressions
Let them blow in the wind like sand
'Cause all of my deeds, You know them

Use me as Your vessel
I want to shine like the candle
Shine like the burning candle in the room

Lord, don't remember, ooh, don't remember
And Father, please elude my transgressions
Let them blow in the wind like sand
'Cause all of my deeds, You know them

Use me as your vessel
I want to shine (Shine) like the candle
Shine like the burning candle in the room
Don't remember me as a carnal man walking
I don't wanna be like the Israel children
Lord, don't remember, ooh, don't remember
My sins from my youth2Embed
