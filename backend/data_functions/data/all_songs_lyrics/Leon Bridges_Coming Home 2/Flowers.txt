Flowers Lyrics
Flowers of the fields
Here today, vanish in the wind
Go to sleep, you may not wake up with the morning sunrise
Move so fast, baby, right before you close your eyes

So you better run
Move fast like the bullet from the gun
Over the hills, salvation rests in the sun
Eternity, baby, rests in the sun
So won't you come?
So won't you come, baby?
So won't you come?
So won't you come, baby?

Making plans (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
For tomorrow (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
Even though you don't (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
Don't know your fate (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
Blind eyes (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
Leaning on a whole dead faith (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
Sink your feet into (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
A concrete foundation (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
So you better run
Move fast like the bullet from the gun
Over the hills, salvation rests in the sun
Eternity, baby, rests in the sun
So won't you come?
So won't you come, baby?
So won't you come?
So won't you come?

I wanna tell you (Tell you) about the good news (Good news)
I wanna tell you (Tell you) about the good news (Good news)
I wanna tell you (Tell you) about the good news (Good news)
I wanna tell you (Tell you)

So you better run
Move fast like the bullet from the gun
Over the hills, salvation rests in the sun
Eternity, baby, rests in the sun
So won't you come?
So won't you come, baby?
So won't you come?
So won't you come, baby?Embed
