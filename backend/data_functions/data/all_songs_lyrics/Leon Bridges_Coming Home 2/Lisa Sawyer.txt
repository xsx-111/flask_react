Lisa Sawyer Lyrics
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

She was born in New Orleans
New Orleans, Louisiana
Branded with the name Lisa Sawyer
Circa 1963

Grandmother was Indian, Indian
Her mother's name was Eartha, swift as the wind
Fierce as fire
Her father's name was Victor
Worked two jobs to provide for his flock

She was the youngest of seven, seven
She grew up on Louisa Street
Chaos around, but inside cozy
Small, but a mansion in her eyes
Eyes, eyes, mansion
Never had much money, money
But was filthy rich
With the wealth you couldn't get from a dark casino
Or a lottery ticket
They had love, love, love
Rich in love


She had the complexion of
The complexion of a sweet praline
Hair long as the sea, heart warm like the Louisiana sun
Voice like a symphony
Of the most beautiful instruments, ooh
Beautiful

At the age of sixteen, sixteen
She found Christ at an altar
All along He was calling her name
The Gospel spoken from an old wrinkly man
Man, man
Gospel
She was born in New Orleans
She was born in New Orleans
She was born in New Orleans
