Silver Machine LyricsI, I just took a ride
In a silver machine
And I'm still feeling mean
Do you want to ride?
See yourself going by
The other side of the sky
I got a silver machine
It flies
Sideways through time
It's an electric line
To your Zodiac sign
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
It flies
Out of a dream
It's antiseptically clean
You're gonna know where I've been
Do you want to ride?
See yourself going by
The other side of the sky
I'm in a silver machine
I said just took a ride
In a silver machine
And I'm still feeling mean
It flies
Sideways through time
It's an electric line
To your Zodiac sign
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine

Well, I just took a ride
In a silver machine
And I'm still feeling mean
Do you want to ride
Sideways through time?
It's an electric line
To your Zodiac sign
It flies out of a dream
It's antiseptically clean
You'd better know it
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
Well I just took a ride
In a silver machine
And I'm still feeling mean
Do you want to ride
Sideways through time?
It's an electric line
To your Zodiac sign
Well I just took a ride
In a silver machine
And I'm still feeling mean
Do you want to ride
Sideways through time?
It's an electric line1Embed
