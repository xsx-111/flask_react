Children of the Sun LyricsThe golden age of the future comes
That which was dreamed of in the past
Where freedom reigns on minds of peace
Minds rich in wisdom to the last
We are the children of the sun
And this is our inheritance
No longer chaos and confusion
But love and laughter, song and danceEmbed
