Born to Go Lyrics
We were born to go
We're never turning back
We were born to go
And leave a burning track
We were born to go
And leave no star unturned
We were born to grow
We were born to learn

We're breaking out of the shell
We're breaking free
We're hatching our dreams
Into reality

We were born to blaze
A new clear way through space
A way out of the maze
That held the human race
We were born to go
As far as we can fly
We were born to go
To blow the human mind
We're breaking out of the shell
We're breaking free
We're hatching our dreams
Into reality

We were born to blaze
A new clear way through space
A way out of the maze
That held the human race
We were born to go
As far as we can fly
We were born to go
To blow the human mind

We're breaking out of the shell
We're breaking free
We're hatching our dreams
Into realityEmbed
