Seven by Seven LyricsLost am I in this world of timelessness and woe
Can I find the doorway through which I must go?
Is the key to this plane too much for me to try to gain?
Is the passport to this world my astral soul?
Seven signs rode on seven stars
Seven ways to find the long lost bards
Seven days became seven years
While Pocus laughed and called foul jeers
Seven times he cursed seven tears
Each one became their seven fears
What is lost is never gained again
I've cast the spell that eternity chained
No more to cry o mortal soul
The astral path is now your fortuitous role
Lost am I in this world of timelessness and woe
Can I find the doorway through which I must go?
Is the key to this plane too much for me to try to gain?
Is the passport to this world my astral soul?Embed
