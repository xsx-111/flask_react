We Took the Wrong Step Years Ago LyricsThink about the things that we should have done before
The way things are going the end is about to fall
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
Look around and see the warning close at hand
Already weeds are writing their scriptures in the sand
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
The morning sun is rising, casting rays across the land
Already nature's calling, take heed of the warning
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
Think about the things that we should have done before
The way that things are going the end is about to fall
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years agoEmbed
