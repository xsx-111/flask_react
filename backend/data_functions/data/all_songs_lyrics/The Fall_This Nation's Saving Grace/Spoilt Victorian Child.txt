Spoilt Victorian Child LyricsPast trees the fairies are flyin
Past trees with rose bushes in
The child was spoilt Victorian
The child was spoilt Victorian
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Sugar and cakes appear mean
Sitting at the table
Tigers pop-up from books
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Let's take it ten years on
You're looking back from then
Under rough grey blankets
Thread loose stained grey blanket
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
C.L.O. - Pedia
E.N.C.Y.C.L.O. - Pedia
Musical chairs rouge cheeks he remembers
Thru' the aqueduct of five years
Spoilt victorian child shall avoid reflection
The child was spoilt victorian
The child was spoilt victorian
The child was spoilt victorian
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Mirrors can't hide the toxic of disfigured poxes
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
Past trees the fairies are flyin
Past trees with rose bushes in
The butterfly shrugs to fly in
Sugar and iced cakes appear mean
The child was spoilt victorian
The child was spoilt victorian
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child
C.L.O. - Pedia
And you know that servants keep their order knowledge
And as you walk in on the footsteps steed babe
In the encrusted green unwild
You know you are a spoilt victorian child1Embed
