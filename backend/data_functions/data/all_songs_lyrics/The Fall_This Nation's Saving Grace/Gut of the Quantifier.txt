Gut of the Quantifier LyricsI'm telling you now and I'm telling you this
Life can be an onward, downward
Chip-chit-chip-chit-chip
I'm not saying they're really thick
But all the groups who've hit it big
Make the Kane Gang look like
An Einstein chip
Chip
NYC
Chip
A place to live
Chip
This is the Thule group
This is the cool group
I'm telling you now and I'm telling you this
Shawn and Petula, macabre
Here are your wedding pictures
They are black
Stick it in the gut
Stick in the mud
Boffins bray
Boffins brag
Stick it in the gut
Stick in the mud
They take from the medium poor to
Give to the needy poor
Via the government poor
Give it to the poor poor
They're knocking on my door
Entrance
Entranced
Stick it in the mud
Stick it in the gut
Cheap fog
Cheap fog
Rotting scout-belt
Stick it in the gut
Who are the riff-makers
Who are they really?
How old are the stars really?
Half-wit philanthropist, cosy charity gig
If God could see this
He'd stick it
They stick it in the gut
Cheap fog
Rotting scout-belt
Stick it in the gut
Stay in the mud
They take it from the medium poor
To give it to the medium poor
Via the government poor
And give it to the poor poor
Stick it in the gut
Red composite
Wealthy philanthropist
You son of a bitch
Entranced
Entrance
Entranced
Stick in the mud
Stick it in the gut
I'm telling you now
And I'm telling you this
Life can be a downward chipEmbed
