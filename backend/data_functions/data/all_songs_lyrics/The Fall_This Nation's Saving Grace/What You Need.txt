What You Need LyricsHow can I? How can I? How can I?
Get up, make a buck
Get up, make a buck
My race was bred on hash
My race was bred on hash
Get up, make a buck
Get up, make a buck
The stolen dark
Please don't 
(What you need)
How can I? (what you need)
How can I? (what you need)
(What you need)
Turn down a corner I been bleeding some itch (what you need)
How can I? (what you need)
What you need (what you need)
What you need, an oven mitt
What you need for your verbose kitchen
What you need (what you need), present notebook for you
What you need, a bit of Iggy Stooge
What you need (what you need)
Whay you need (what you need), reduced smoking habit
What you need (what you need)
Sex but not having it
What you need, one face, two face new (what you need)
Slippery shoes for your horrible feet
We're obsessed with (we're obsessed with) what you need
What you need is to love her so much
What you need is us as pressure group
Out of reach (what you need)
On this we're all agreed
What you need (what you need)
One: Face with girl past
What you need
Two: a profile that is low-key
And to meet your horrible new dad
With a grudge against me
What you need (MES and band)
What you need (band)
Is a censor for pals like these
What you need (MES and band)
What you need (band)
What you need (MES and band)
What you need is
One. What face?
Two: face new
Three. Face mag for arse
Four. Three rules of audience
Five. Mug of Geoff Travis, framed (what you need)
Six. The book Theft is Vision by the brothers Copeland
What you need (what you need), finance luck
What you need
Out of reach (what you need)
What you need
What you need (what you need)
Get up, make a buck (what you need)
How can I? (what you need)
How can I? (what you need)
How can I? (what you need)Embed
