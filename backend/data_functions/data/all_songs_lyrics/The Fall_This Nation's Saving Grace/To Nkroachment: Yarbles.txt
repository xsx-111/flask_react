To Nkroachment: Yarbles LyricsFull credit
Everyday you have to die some
Everyday you have to cry some
For the rumour
All the good times are past and gone
Wipe the tears from your eyes son
On the landing

Full credit
In the bathroom the presence was luminous
Everyday you have to die some
Everyday you have to cry some
All the good times are past and gone....
On the landing they found full credit
In the bathroom the presence was illuminousEmbed
