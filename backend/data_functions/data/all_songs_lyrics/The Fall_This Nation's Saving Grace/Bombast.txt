Bombast LyricsAll those whose mind entitles themselves, and whose main entitle is themselves shall feel the wrath of my bombast

Clanging in my heart
Bastard
Clanging in my heart
Bastard
Feel the wrath of my bombast
Bastard, bastard, idiot
Bombast, bombast
Ah ah ah ah ah
Idiot, bastard, idiot
Ow ow ow ow
Those who dare mix real life with politics
And go on regardless of the of the discoveries
Will feel the wrath of bombast
Clanging in my heart
Ah ah ah ah ah
All those whose mind entitles themselves, and whose main entitle is themselves shall feel the wrath of bombastEmbed
