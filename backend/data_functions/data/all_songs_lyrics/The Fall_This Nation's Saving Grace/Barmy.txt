Barmy LyricsOut of England, I dream of its creamery
When I'm there I dwell on Saxony
In Turkey when I've been due to World War I
Istanbul is the place cause of my birthday
I am barmy
Bleedin' barmy
I got everything
I got everything I want except for hungry
I got everything I want except for money
I've got the best round set aside for parties
They'll have one when I've gone, In fact, they said so, good one
I am barmy
Bleedin' barmy
Friends disintegrate within circles of cash
Residue after years of fab genius
Is a pension for the Jews and a medal from the company
Which I wiped my butt on and hung on a laburnum tree
I am barmy
Bleedin' barmy
I am barmy
Bleedin' barmy
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
I lay waiting hopefully on sloped grass green
I am barmy, bleedin' barmy
A dramatic verse
A dramatic verse
A dramatic verse
The programs lot
We break into tune
Take and bring a word
Ring a buzzer
Take and bring a word ( " )
