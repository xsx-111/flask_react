Come Healing Lyrics
O gather up the brokenness and bring it to me now
The fragrance of those promises you never dared to vow
The splinters that you carry, the cross you left behind
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind
And let the heavens hear it, the penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

Behold the gates of mercy in arbitrary space
And none of us deserving, the cruelty or the grace
O solitude of longing where love has been confined
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind
O see the darkness yielding, that tore the light apart
Come healing of the reason
Come healing of the heart

O troubled dust concealing, an undivided love
The Heart beneath is teaching to the broken Heart above
O let the heavens falter and let the earth proclaim:
Come healing of the Altar
Come healing of the Name
O longing of the branches to lift the little bud
O longing of the arteries to purify the blood
And let the heavens hear it, the penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb
O let the heavens hear it, the penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb2Embed
