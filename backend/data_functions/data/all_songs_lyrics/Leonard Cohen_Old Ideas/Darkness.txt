Darkness Lyrics
I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
I'm drinking from your cup
I said: Is this contagious?
You said: Just drink it up

I got no future
I know my days are few
The present's not that pleasant
Just a lot of things to do
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got that too

I should have seen it coming
It was right behind your eyes
You were young and it was summer
I just had to take a dive
Winning you was easy
But darkness was the prize

I don't smoke no cigarette
I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call
Hey I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all
I used to love the rainbow
And I used to love the view
I loved the early morning
I'd pretend that it was new
But I caught the darkness baby
And I got it worse than you

I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
I'm drinking from your cup
I said: Is this contagious?
You said: Just drink it up3Embed
