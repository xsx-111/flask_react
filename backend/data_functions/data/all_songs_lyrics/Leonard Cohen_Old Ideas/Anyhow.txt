Anyhow LyricsYou know, it really is a pity
The way you treat me now
I know you can't forgive me
But forgive me anyhow
The ending got so ugly
I even heard you say
You never ever loved me
But could you love me anyway?
I dreamed about you baby
You were wearing half your dress
I know you have to hate me
But could you hate me less?
I've used up all my chances
And you'll never take me back
But there ain't no harm in asking
Could you cut me one more slack?
I'm naked and I'm filthy
And there's sweat upon my brow
And both of us are guilty
Anyhow
Have mercy on me, baby
After all I did confess
Even though you have to hate me
Could you hate me less?
It's a shame and it's a pity
I know you can't forgive me
The ending got so ugly
You never ever loved me
Dreamed about you, baby
I know you have to hate me
I'm naked and I'm filthy
And both of us are guilty (Anyhow)
Have mercy on me babyEmbed
