Lullaby LyricsSleep baby sleep
The day's on the run
The wind in the trees
Is talking in tongues
If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is long
Here's my lullaby
Here's my lullaby
Well the mouse ate the crumb
Then the cat ate the crust
Now they've fallen in love
And they're talking in tongues
If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is long
Here's my lullaby
Here's my lullaby
Sleep baby, sleep
There's a morning to come
The wind and the trees
They're talking in tongues
If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is long
Here's my lullaby
Here's my lullabyEmbed
