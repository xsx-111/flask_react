Banjo LyricsThere's something that I'm watching
Means a lot to me (something that I'm watching)
There's something that I'm watching
Means a lot to me (something that I'm watching)
It's a broken banjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea (something that I'm watching)
It's a broken banjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea
Don't know how it got there
Maybe taken by the wave (taken by the wave)
Don't know how it got there
Probably taken by the wave (taken by the wave)
Off of someone's shoulder
Or out of someone's grave
Off of someone's shoulder
Or out of someone's grave
It's coming for me darling
No matter where I go (no matter where I go)
It's coming for me darling
No matter where I go (no matter where I go)
Its duty is to harm me
My duty is to know
Its duty is to harm me
My duty is to know
There's something that I'm watching
Means a lot to me
There's something that I'm watching
Means a lot to me
It's a broken banjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea
It's a broken banjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea2Embed
