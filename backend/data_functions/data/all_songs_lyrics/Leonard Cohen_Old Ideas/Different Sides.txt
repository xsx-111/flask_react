Different Sides Lyrics
We find ourselves on different sides
Of a line, nobody drew
Though it all may be one in the higher eye
Down here where we live, it is two
I, to my side, call the meek and the mild
You, to your side, call the Word
By virtue of suffering I claim to have won
You claim to have never been heard

Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
But I wanna leave it alone (alone, alone, alone)
The pull of the moon, the thrust of the sun
Thus the ocean is crossed (woah)
The waters are blessed while a shadowy guest
Kindles a light for the lost

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly, I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
Yeah but I wanna leave it alone
Down in the valley, the famine goes on
Famine up on the hill
I say that you shouldn't, you couldn't, you can't
You say that you must and you will
You want to live where the suffering is
I want to get out of town
C'mon baby, give me a kiss
Stop writing everything down

Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
But I wanna leave it alone
Both of us say there are laws to obey
Frankly, I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
But I wanna leave it aloneEmbed
