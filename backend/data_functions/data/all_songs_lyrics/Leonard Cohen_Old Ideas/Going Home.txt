Going Home LyricsI'd love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard
Living in a suit
But he does say what I tell him
Even though it isn't welcome
He just doesn't have the freedom
To refuse
He will speak these words of wisdom
Like a sage, a man of vision
Though he knows he's really nothing
But the brief elaboration of a tube
Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better
Than before
Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without this costume
That I wore
He wants to write a love song
An anthem of forgiving
A manual for living
With defeat
A cry above the suffering
A sacrifice recovering
But that isn't what I need him
To complete
I want him to be certain
That he doesn't have a burden
That he doesn't need a vision
That he only has permission
To do my instant bidding which is to
Say what I have told him to repeat
Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better than before
Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without the costume that I wore
I'm going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better than before
Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without this costume that I wore
I love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard living in a suit4Embed
