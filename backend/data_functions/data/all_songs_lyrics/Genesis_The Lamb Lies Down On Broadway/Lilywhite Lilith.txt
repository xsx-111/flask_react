Lilywhite Lilith Lyrics
The chamber was in confusion
All the voices shouting loud
I could only just hear a voice quite near say
"Please help me through the crowd"

Said if I helped her through she could help me too
But I could see that she was wholly blind
From her pale face and her pale skin
A moonlight shined

Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna take you through the tunnel of night
Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna lead you right

When I'd led her through the people
The angry noise began to grow
She said, "Let me feel the way the breezes blow
And I'll show you where to go"

So I followed her into a big round cave
She said, "They're coming for you, now don't be afraid"
Then she sat me down on a cold stone throne
Carved in jade
Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna take you through the tunnel of night
Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna lead you right

She leaves me in my darkness
I have to face, face my fear
And the darkness closes in on me
I can hear a whirring sound growing near

I can see the corner of the tunnel
Lit up by whatever's coming here
Two golden globes float into the room
And a blaze of white light fills the airEmbed
