Anyway LyricsAll the pumping's nearly over for my sweet heart
This is the one for me
Time to meet the chef
Oh boy, the running man is out of death
Feel cold and old, it's getting hard to catch my breath
It's back to ash
Now, you've had your flash boy
The rocks, in time compress
Your blood to oil
Your flesh to coal
Enrich the soil
Not everybody's goal
Anyway, they say she comes on a pale horse
But I'm sure I hear a train
Oh boy, I don't even feel no pain
I guess I must be driving myself insane
Damn it all
Does earth plug a hole in heaven
Or heaven plug a hole in earth
How wonderful to be so profound
When everything you are is dying underground
I feel the pull on the rope, let me off at the rainbow
I could have been exploding in space
Different orbits for my bones
Not me, just quietly buried in stones
Keep the deadline open with my maker
See me stretch; for God's elastic acre
The doorbell rings and it's
"Good morning Rael
So sorry you had to wait
It won't be long, yeah
She's very rarely late"Embed
