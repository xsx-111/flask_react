In the Rapids LyricsMoving down the water
John is drifting out of sight
It's only at the turning point
That you find out how you fight
In the cold, feel the cold
All around
And the rush of crashing water
Surrounds me with its sound
Striking out to reach you
I can't get through to the other side
When you're racing in the rapids
There's only one way, that's to ride
Taken down, taken down by the undertow
I'm spiraled down the river bed, my fire is burning low
Catching hold of a rock that's firm, I'm waiting for John to be carried past
We hold together, hold together and shoot the rapids fast
And when the waters slow down, the dark and the deep
Have no one, no one, no one, no one, no one left to keep
Hang on John, we're out of this at last
Something's changed, that's not your face, it's mine
It's mine!Embed
