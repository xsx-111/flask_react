It LyricsWhen it's cold, it come slow
It is warm, just watch it grow
All around me
It is here, it is now
Just a little bit of it, can bring you up or down
Like the supper, it is cooking in your hometown
It is chicken, it is eggs
It is in between your legs
It is walking on the moon
Leaving your cocoon
It is the jigsaw, it is purple haze
It never stays in one place, but it's not a passing phase
It is in the single's bar, in the distance of the face
It is in between the cages, it is always in a space
It is here, it is now
Any rock can be made to roll
If you've enough of it to pay the toll
It has no home in words or goal
Not even in your favourite hole
It is the hope for the dope
When you ride the horse without a hoof
It is shaken, not stirred;
Cocktails on the roof
When you eat right fruit you see everything alive
It is inside spirit, with enough grit to survive
If you think that it's pretentious, you've been taken for a ride
Look across the mirror sonny, before you choose decide
It is here, it is now
It is real
It is Rael
'Cos it's only knock and know all, but I like it1Embed
