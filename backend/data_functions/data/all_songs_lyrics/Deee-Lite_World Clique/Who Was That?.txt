Who Was That? LyricsWho was that, who was that?
Someone walked their feet through my house
Who was that, who was that?
Someone's sneaking quiet as a mouse
Who was that, who was that?
Someone left their shoes on the stairs
Who was that, who was that?
Laughing just like no one cares
Someone's in my house, I declare
Playing cards, solitaire
Who was playing in my house?
Someone's in my kitchen, munching out
Peanut butter, there's no doubt
Who was eating in my house?
Someone took a bath, Mr. Bubble
Middle name, must be trouble
Who was playing in my house?
On the porch, right outside
Here I come, you better hide
Who was hiding inside?
Who was that, who was that?
Someone walked their feet through my house
Who was that, who was that?
Someone's sneaking quiet as a mouse
Who was that, who was that? Boy
Someone left the radio on
Who was that, who was that? Boy
One minute here, now he's goneEmbed
