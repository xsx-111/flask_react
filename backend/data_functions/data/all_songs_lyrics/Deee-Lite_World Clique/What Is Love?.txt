What Is Love? Lyrics
What is love?
I think I know what love is
I think I know what love is
I think I know I think
What is love? What is love?

Mmm how do you say
Delicious, delovely
Delectable, Divine?
How do you say
Degorgeous? Dewith it?
Degroovy? Define?
Ooh lala lalalalala
How do you say delicious?
How do you say delovely?
How do you say delectable?
How do you say divine?
How do you say degroovy?
Dewith it?
How do you say Deee-Lite?
