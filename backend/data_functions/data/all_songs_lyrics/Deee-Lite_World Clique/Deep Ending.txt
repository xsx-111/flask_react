Deep Ending LyricsOur game is over I know it's too late
But still we learn from each and every mistake
A sweet simple love maybe we've overgrown
I'll be getting over on my own
Our love is like our shower
It runs hot and cold hot and cold
It's getting colder, I wanna hold you
Let me be your blanket when it's getting colder
I'm depending depending depending on you
I'm deep-ending, I'm at the deep end
I don't know, I don't know what to do
You stop messing around stop messing
You stop messing around stop messing
You stop messing around stop messing
Around round round round round
You should have a license to love
You're loving dangerously
You're weaving all over my heart
Now I need a jump start babyEmbed
