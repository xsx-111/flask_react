Smile On LyricsYou don't have to say no words
And it comes in every language
You can see it in every nation
It helps communication
It's like a shining sun
Up high in the sky
And when you blink your eyes
It's like a nice surprise
Take your time
As long as you make the time
To be happy
Smile on, pass it on
Smile on, pass it on
Do do dodoo
Do do do do dodoo
You got to keep moving
Keep movin keep movin
It's a universal sign
Everyone can do it
You can change people's minds
If you choose to use it
Smile on, pass it on
Smile on, pass it onEmbed
