E.S.P. LyricsWon't you listen to what the DJ's spinnin'
He's tappin' into just what you're feelin'
Won't you listen to what the DJ's spinnin'
He's tappin' into just what you're feelin'
ESP ouijee yeeyee
ESP runs right through me
Sometimes to blind to see
The mirror between you and me
ESP boomerang me
ESP mind orgy
Like a songbird melody
Whose cage is really free
ESP hypnotize me
ESP 3D stylee
I'd walk a milely for your smilely
Because it's really recommended quite highly
Won't you listen to what the DJ's spinnin
He's tappin into just what you're feelin
Won't you listen to what the DJ's spinnin
He's tappin into just what you're feelin
Supernatural perhaps

Psychic power psychic power
Psychic Psych-Hour

Psych-Hour Psych-Hour Psych-Hour
ESP mystery see
ESP skips right through time see
Freaky mystiquery
It's ESP I dig highly
Copper beat conducts our feet
Like a doodle beat skipping down the street
In 3D NYC
You can hold the bird
But the song she sings is really free
Really free, really free, really free
Really free, really free, really free
Psychic power psychic power
Psychic Psych-Hour
Psychic Psych-Hour
Psych-Hour Psych-Hour Psych-Hour
Midi soul is really groovy
On a roll this DJ moves me
To some he is a guru
He pushes grooves that go right through you
Won't you listen to what the DJ's spinnin
He's tappin into just what you're feelin
Won't you listen to what the DJ's spinnin
He's tappin into just what you're feelin
Supernatural perhaps

Psychic power psychic power
