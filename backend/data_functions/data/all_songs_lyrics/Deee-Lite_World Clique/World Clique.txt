World Clique LyricsWe don't need a clique
To make our clock tick
Our clique is the world
The world is our clique
We don't have to fit
In your fixed trip
Our clique is the world
The world is our trip
We don't need a clique
To make our clock tick
Our clique is the world
The world is our clique
World clique, world clique
World clique, world clique
Small clique is like a jip in line
It happens all the time but it's limited
World clique is like a skip through time
It's fine and I'm digging it
I don't have to squeeze
Just to appease your dream
My peace is the world
The world is a clique
The world is our clique
The world is a clique
World clique, world cliqueEmbed
