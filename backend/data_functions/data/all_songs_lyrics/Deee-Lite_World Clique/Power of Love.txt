Power of Love Lyrics
I believe in the power of love (I believe)
I believe in the power of love (I believe)
I believe in the power of love
I believe in the power of love
Feel the power
Let the people call me naive
I believe
I believe
I believe
I believe
Hey
(I believe)

What is it that can make a lost soul found?
Love
And what is it that can make the coldest day seem warm?
Love
And what is it that can bring a smile through to strangers?
Love
Love
Love
Love

I believe in the power of love (I believe)
I believe in the power of love (I believe)
I believe in the power of love
Let them call me na√Øve
But I still believe

Power of love
Power of love
Power of love
Power of love

What is it that can make a lost soul found?
Love
And what is it that can make the coldest day seem warm?
Love
And what is it that can bring a smile through to strangers?
Give it everything
'Cause what you give you get
So give it everything
Open your heart

I believe
I believe
I believe
I believe
Hey
Love
Love
Love
Love
I belive
I belive
I belive
I belive
Hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(I believe)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(I believe)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(I believe)Embed
