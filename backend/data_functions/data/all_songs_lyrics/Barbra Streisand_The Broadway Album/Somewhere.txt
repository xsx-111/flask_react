Somewhere LyricsSomewhere
Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us, somewhere
There's a time for us
Some day there'll be a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn
Time to care
Some day
Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find there's a way of forgiving
Somewhere (Somewhere, somewhere)
There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow
Some day
Somewhere!Embed
