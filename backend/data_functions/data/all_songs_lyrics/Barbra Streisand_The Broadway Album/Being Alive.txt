Being Alive Lyrics
Someone to hold you too close
Someone to hurt you too deep
Someone to sit in your chair
And ruin your sleep
And make you aware
Of being alive
Someone to need you too much
Someone to know you too well
Someone to pull you up short
And put you through hell
And give you support
For being alive
Being alive
Make me alive
Make me confused
Mock me with praise
Let me be used
Vary my days
But alone is alone, not alive
Somebody hold me too close
Somebody force me to care
Somebody make me come through
I'll alway be there
As frightened as you
Of being alive
Being alive, being alive
Someone you have to let in
Someone whose feelings you spare
Someone who, like it or not
Will want you to share
A little, a lot
Of being alive
Make me alive
Make me confused
Mock me with praise
Let me be used
Vary my days
But alone is alone, not alive
Somebody crowd me with love
Somebody force me to care
Somebody make me come through
I'll always be there
Frightened as you
To help us survive
Being alive, being alive
Being alive
Being aliveEmbed
