Exitlude LyricsAggressively we all defend the role we play
Regrettably time's come to send you on your way
Weâ€™ve seen it all bonfires of trust flash floods of pain
It doesn't really matter, don't you worry, it'll all work out
No, it doesn't even matter, don't you worry 'bout what it's all about
We hope you enjoyed your stay
It's good to have you with us, even if it's just for the day
We hope you enjoyed your stay
Outside the sun is shining, seems like heaven ain't far away
It's good to have you with us
Even if it's just for the day
It's good to have you with us even, if it's just for the day
Outside the sun is shining, seems like heaven ain't far away
It's good to have you with us even, if it's just for the day
Outside the sun is shining, seems like heaven ain't far away8Embed
