Man It Feels Like Space Again Lyrics
We can talk by the river
We can walk right out to the sea
I haven't talked much lately
Maybe that's why you never talk to me
Ah ah

So you're at a low
Your speeding heart is getting slow
The music fades before your mind
You hold her hand and whisper, "Man, man,"
"Man, it feels like space again"
Your saw her face and then she cries
The River Styx is getting wide
The Brooklyn wastes and rolling waves
And Jesus says, they both say

We can talk by the river
We can walk right out to the sea
I haven't talked much lately
Maybe that's why you never talk to me
Ah ah
We can talk by the river
We can walk right out to the sea
I haven't talked much lately
Maybe that's why you never talk to me
Ah ah

It took him all his life to know
It took him all his life to know
It took him all his life to know
It took him all his life to know
It took him all his life to know3Embed
