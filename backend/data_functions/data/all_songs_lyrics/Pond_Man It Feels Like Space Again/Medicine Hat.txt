Medicine Hat LyricsBeen walking in circles so long
My head is spinning, direction's gone
The night is darkest just before the dawn
So goodbye, my friend, it's time to move on
I'm taking some time to clear out my mind
To change up the light
Oh, why did I leave it so long?
Drawn in and caught up in the throng
I guess I'm saying that this time I was wrong
Remembering is hardest when you're alone
Broken and cold, stuck on a map
Well on my way to Medicine HatEmbed
