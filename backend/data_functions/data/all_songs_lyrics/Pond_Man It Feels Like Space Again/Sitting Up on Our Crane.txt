Sitting Up on Our Crane LyricsSitting up on our crane
It always feels the same
When we're up high
'Cause I feel like I'll fall and die
And I can't say goodbye to my friends
'Cause they're having a real good time
Getting on another plane
It always feels the same
When we're up high
'Cause I feel like we'll crash and die
And I can't say goodbye to my love
She's been sleeping the whole flight
And you know
It's gonna get you feeling like you're going down
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming up
As you're speeding towards the ground
It's gonna get you feeling like you're going down
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming up
As you're speeding towards the ground
Sitting up on our crane
It always feels the same
When we're up high
'Cause I feel like I'll fall and die
And I can't say goodbye to my friends
'Cause they're having a real good time
And you know
It's gonna get you feeling like you're going down
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming up
As you're speeding towards the ground
Oh, it's gonna get you feeling like you're going down
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming up
As you're speeding towards the ground
All I wanna do is getting drunk and listen to Dennis Wilson
Cause he's the man, oh yeah-yeah-yeah, cause he's the man, yeah-yeahEmbed
