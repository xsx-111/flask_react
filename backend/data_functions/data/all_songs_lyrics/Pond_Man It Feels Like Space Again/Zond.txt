Zond LyricsI need the ground when I shake my brain I must have felt the sound
You were travelling on, following Zond
Four deep tonight in sixty-five we were left for God
Tell me what went wrong, what about Zond?
When I found the ghost, it's meaning after all
I'm gonna tell you what I saw, and where it came from
Well, when I'm 'round the door, when I'm 'round the made it back down
Leave it all where we started this song
A song about Zond
Cross my heart, universe, go black on me
After all I've seen, in a waking dream
We're from the darkness in between
Gently unscrew me
I wanna love me Julie, gonna do me Julie
But the light and the sun and the moon and sound
A merry-go round
And I misbehave, well, I keep awaiting, trying to meditate
When I'm on my round
Oh all the elegant sound
Now I'm like the dog on a satellite home
And I'm flying high and it must be found
When I'm 'round the door I made it back down
And it all really-really is Zond, a song about Zond
Cross my heart, universe, go black on me
After all I've seen, in a waking dream
I'm from the darkness in betweenEmbed
