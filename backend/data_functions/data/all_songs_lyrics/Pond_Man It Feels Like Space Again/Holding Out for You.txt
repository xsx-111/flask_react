Holding Out for You LyricsWhat in the world ever made that young girl cry
The tears down her cheeks she tries to hide?
And what of the man who passes calmly by?
Oh why? No
Oh lies are no longer needed
He frankly conceded
I am not the way that you had hoped and prayed
I'm sorry if I've caused you any pain
But please believe me when I try to say
I feel like I am going insane oh it'll be better off for you this way
I was holding out for you
I was holding out for you
I was holding out for you
I was holding out for you7Embed
