Take These Hands and Throw Them in the River LyricsWe got desperate
Waiting for our cheques to come
I got drunk, you got high
You would not raise your eyes
We got desperate
Waiting for our cheques to come
I got drunk, you got high
You would not raise your eyes
Cop cars on every corner
We're all alone
Cop cars on every corner
We're crawling home
Take these hands and throw them in the river
Take these hands and throw them in the river
Take these hands and throw them in the river
Take these hands and bury them in your handsEmbed
