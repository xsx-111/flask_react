Built Then Burnt (Hurrah! Hurrah!) LyricsDear brothers and sisters
Dear enemies and friends
Why are we all so alone here?
All we need is a little more hope
A little more joy
All we need is a little more light
A little less weight
A little more freedom
If we were an army
And if we believed that we were an army
And we believed that everyone was scared
Like little lost children in their grown-up clothes and poses
So we ended up alone here
Floating through long wasted days
Or great tribulations
While everything felt wrong
Good words, strong words
Words that could've moved mountains!
Words that no one ever said
We were all waiting to hear those words
And no one ever said them
And the tactics never hatched
And the plans were never mapped
And we all learned not to believe
And strange lonesome monsters loped through the hills
Wondering why
Though it is best to never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever wonder why
So tangle
O tangle us up in bright red ribbons!
Let's have a parade
It's been so long since we had a parade
So let's have a parade!
Let's invite all our friends
And all our friends' friends!
Let's promenade down the boulevards with terrific pride
And light in our eyes
Twelve feet tall and staggering
Sick with joy with the angels there and light in our eyes
Brothers and sisters
Hope still waits in the wings
Like a bitter spinster
Impatient, lonely, and shivering
Waiting to build her glorious fires
It's because of our plans, man
Our beautiful ridiculous plans
Let's launch them like careening jetplanes
Let's crash all our planes into the river
Let's build strange and radiant machines
At this jericho waiting to fallEmbed
