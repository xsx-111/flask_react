Look at That Lyrics
Look at that
Look at this
Drop a stone in the abyss
Then walk away and know that anything can happen
Just like that
Just like this
Look at that
Look at this
Give me a hug, give me a kiss
Then hey, hey, off to school we go
You might learn something
Yeah you never know
Look at that
Look at this
Lovers merge and make a wish
They close their eyes and now their dreams are legal
Over the mountain the eagles flies
Through clouds of fire
Swoop and glide
You can't believe it
You can't decide

Ask somebody to love you
Takes a lot of nerve
Look at that
Look at this
This near enough to bliss
Then over the top we go and down
Down to the bottom
If you're looking for worries
You got them


Come awake, come alive
Common sense we survive
Then hey, hey, down the road we go
You might learn something
Yeah, you never know
But anyway you've got to go1Embed
