Songs for Women Lyrics
Haha
When I was younger, I used to wonder, like...

If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, "Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun"

We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Shit, oh well, oh well," ha
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me..."
You'd be singin' to her
Like, "La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da"

Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me

Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Okay, I don't believe it"
I say "Nope, I swear, I never do it"
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend"
Ah, ah
(Ooh, ooh, ah) Ooh, ah
Yeah
Fair enough

Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair
But it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half
Ah, ah
I'm singing, "La-da, da-da" ‘bout heartbreak
And now, I'm singing, "La-da, da-da" 'bout love lost

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Damn
Haha
I'm saying though, like...
All I write is love songs
I mean, I try
I come to the studio
I—you know what I do
What you think I do it for? Huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listening, never
But if you were...
Might bug with it
Haha, yeah
All these songs for women
Songs for women
Songs for you, baby
For you25Embed
