There Will Be Tears Lyrics
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when the tears have run out
We'll be numb and blue, blue

I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I still dream, dream, dream
I still dream, dream (There will be)

My grandaddy was a player
Pretty boy in a pair of gators
See, I met him later on
Think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know
But pretty soon, he'd be gone too
Hide my face, hide my face
Can't let 'em see me crying
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying
My friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had
Well, I can
I'm sad and
There will be tears, I have no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue

"I can't be there"
That's all you had to say to me was you couldn't be there
Why couldn't you say to me you won't be there?
You coulda warned me you wouldn't be here
Right here, you wouldn't be here for me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh37Embed
