American Wedding Lyrics
American love
American me
American you
American tears
American heartbreak
Oh, oh, oh

I took a walk with the palm trees
As the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you (You)
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

M-R-S dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen (Oh)
In the fancy, fancy cursive (Oh)
Then turned her term papers in (Oh, oh)
A thesis on Islamic (Oh)
Virgin brides and arranged marriage (Ah, ah)
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know (Oh)
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far" (Oh)
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

Well, you can have my Mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Oh, if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later, anyway
It's love made in the USA


Don't let 'em front you, they sayin' you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be trippin' over some bitch-ass dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You could get sensitive, but this shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
And nigga, if I did it, I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do65Embed
