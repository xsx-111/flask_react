Lovecrimes Lyrics
Crazy
I plead insanity
Crazy for you, baby
Crazy, na, na

Talk to me
And I better not hear a word
Oh, do me baby
Ooh, I better not feel it, girl
Baby, I, I still got one bullet left
In my nine
Finna do a love crime, love crime
Finna do a love crime

Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes

You write me love letters
With your father's pen, oh
If he knew the freaky, freaky things
That you write with it, oh
Is it really wrong that I want
To be the baby daddy?
Is that a love crime, love crime?
Tell me it's a love crime
Eh, murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Oh, yeah, yeah
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Oh, yeah, yeah

In the getaway car
You know I love it when the ride is smooth
If we ever get caught
It'd be a long vacation for two

Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
"Millions of years of evolution, right? Right!? Men have to stick it in every place they can, but for women– women, it is just about security, and commitment, and– ah, whatever the fuck else! If you men only knew. But you're not the jealous type, are you? You've never been jealous about me, have you? And why haven't you ever been jealous about me!? You are very, very sure of yourself, aren't you?"30Embed
