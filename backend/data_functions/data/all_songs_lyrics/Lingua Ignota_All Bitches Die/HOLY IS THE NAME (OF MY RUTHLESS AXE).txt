HOLY IS THE NAME (OF MY RUTHLESS AXE) Lyrics
"All that pain. I thought to myself, I gotta fight, I'm gonna die. This guy is going to play with me, play with me, and then he is going to kill me. He already said he's going to kill me, he already said he killed other girls, I gotta fight. I jumped up real fast and I spit in his face. And he said "you're death bitch, you're dead" and he's wiping his eyes. And I laid down real quick and grabbed my bag. And he was starting to come for me, when I grabbed my bag, and whipped my pistol out toward him, and he was coming towards me with his right arm I believe, and I shot immediately and I think I shot twice, as fast as I could."
Holy is the name of the seeping gash
Holy is the name of my ruthless axe
Holy is the name of the endless night
Holy is the name of my gleaming scythe
All my rapists lay beside me
All my rapists cold and grey
Holy is the name of the seeping gash
Holy is the name of my ruthless axe
All my rapists lay beside me
All my rapists still and grey
All my rapists lay beside me
All my rapists still and grey1Embed
