FOR I AM THE LIGHT (AND MINE IS THE ONLY WAY NOW) Lyrics"All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all
Each little flowâ€™r that opens
Each little bird that sings
He made their glowing colors
He made their tiny wings."
"Everyone in this world is evil and all of us are full of evil in one way or the other. In whatever we do. We have evil in us, all of us do."
"I set before you life or death, make a choice today - are you going to chose life, or will you choose death? We all make that decision, and we make it every day of our lives. My life is in Your hands. My heart beats because You tell it to beat. I live because You tell me to live. I exist because You exist. I am what I am. By the grace of God, hallelujah..."
For I am the light
And mine is the only way
Be silent
Understand
Each breath you draw is mine
Each fingertip is mine
Each strand of hair is mine
And all things begin and end with me
For I am the light
I am the light
And my hands take hold on justice
And my feet go down to death
Swift is the stroke of my hammer
And I repay evil with evil
For I am the light
And mine is the only way now
And all things end with me
Lord God, Lord God, frigid father
I beg of you from a throat raw with curses
By your almighty grace
Intercede for me
Console me with blood
That my woes be avenged
One thousand fold
That my victory be glorious
For I am the light
And mine is the only way now
And all things begin and end with me
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all
The purple-headed mountains
The river running by
The sunset and the morning
That brightens up the sky
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all
The cold wind in the winter
The pleasant summer sun
The ripe fruits in the garden
He made them every one
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all1Embed
