WOE TO ALL (ON THE DAY OF MY WRATH) LyricsWoe to all
On the day of my wrath
Go and hide yourselves
Who among you will be able to stand?

My master pulled me from my bed
Ripped every curl from out my head
Held me down to strip me bare
Said "Hell is real, I'll take you there."
O master, master, please be kind
Don't leave me somewhere God won't find
Don't drag me to a sea of flame
From which I'll never rise again
I bring the end
I bring the end to all things
I crush the seven golden stars
In my rotten right hand
The teeth of seven thousand men
Adorn my silver crown
Where'er I walk
Ten thousand flies precede me
Where'er I walk
Ten thousand serpents follow at my feet
My tongue is an axe, and a sword, and a five pointed dagger
With a single word
Every mountain shall crumble
Every tree shall fall
Every field shall be razed
Every crop shall rot
Every home shall be painted with blood
Every lung shall be flooded with bile
And woe to all who inhabit the earth
For now I walk among you
Woe to all who inhabit the earth
For now I walk among you
Woe to all who inhabit the earth
Woe to all who inhabit the earth
Woe to all
Woe, woe
For on the day of my wrath
Go and hide yourselves
Who among you will be able to stand?
Woe, woe, woe
Woe, woe, woe5Embed
