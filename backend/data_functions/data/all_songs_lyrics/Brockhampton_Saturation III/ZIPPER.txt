ZIPPER Lyrics
Pretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?
I don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle
That and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow
The other's gold and complemental trusty, wellâ€”well...
I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud
Burn my dress shoes in a fire with the wood
Sit back and relax with the fumes of
Everything I hate in the world
Play Mozart, smoke my cigar on
My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn
Neighbors hate, place duct tape underneath their tires
And I wait

Sunsets to blood moon horizons
Left brain and right brain divided
Set frames and watch plays inside them
In the mountains now's where you'll find him
I smell a breeze in the morning
I feel your presence, it's warming
I paid attention to warnings
But we were too caught up in transforming

Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Lucky days, I'm burnin' the four-cyl'
Your boy is dusty like brush up a fossil
Hear that shit urk like the noise of a possum
Bitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle
Built like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle
Fuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one
Come fuck with me and my dogs
Hate on my ass like in-laws, ugh
That boy stay light like a cheerleader, um
She want me filled like a two-liter, um
Eat it all day, watch it ricochet off
Then I skrrt off on that Michelin, aww
They don't got nothing on me 'til I pop
They don't got nothing on me, call the cops
I hit that run like a Heisman, boy, run it back
Look at that boy, hit that running back

Shout out to South Central, San Marcos
I got addicted to soft-shell tacos
Got down to pennies and ramen noodles
Now, I see how hunger make a shooter
Stamina, stamina
I used to be holding the camera
Head hit the glass, dog your window up
Fans praying to me like my handle Cortana
We like Wu-Tang, but I feel like Santana
She twerkin' just like she Hannah Montana
Head was clean, Tony Fantano
Made her my wife-uh
She can't kick it, she so Bella
Confused erections
Bad hoes know name brands, they brainless
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to49Embed
