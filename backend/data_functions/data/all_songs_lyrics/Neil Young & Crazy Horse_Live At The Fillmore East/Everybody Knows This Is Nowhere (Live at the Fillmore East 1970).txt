Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (Live at the Fillmore East 1970) Lyrics
I think I'd like to go back home and take it easy
There's a woman that I'd like to get to know living there

Everybody seems to wonder what it's like down here
I gotta get away from this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody knows, everybody knows

Every time I think about back home, it's cool and breezy
I wish that I could be there right now, just passing time

Everybody seems to wonder what it's like down here
I gotta get away from this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody knows this is nowhere

I think I'd like to go back home and take it easy
There's a woman that I'd like to get to know living there
Everybody seems to wonder what it's like down here
I gotta get away from this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knowsEmbed
