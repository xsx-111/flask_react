Winterlong (Live at the Fillmore East 1970) LyricsI waited for you, Winterlong
You seem to be where I belong
It's all illusion anyway
If things should ever turn out wrong
And all the love we have is gone
It won't be easy on that day
Waiting to follow
Through the dreamlight of your way
Is not so easy for me now
Half the time has passed away
Things we thought of yesterday
Come back now, come back now
Waiting to follow
Through the dreamlight of your way
Is not so easy for me now
Half the time has passed away
Things we thought of yesterday
Come back now, come back now
I waited for you Winterlong
You seem to be where I belongEmbed
