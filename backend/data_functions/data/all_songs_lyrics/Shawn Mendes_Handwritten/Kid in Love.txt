Kid in Love Lyrics
I know that we just met and maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine
The way you’re lighting up the room caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door, we don’t have to say goodbye
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
To waste time tonight

Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
If this is what it’s like falling in love
Then I don’t ever wanna grow up
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
It’d be cool if it was the two of us
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up

Said your place is kinda close and your 'rents are out of town
Baby there’s no pressure, but if you’re down I’m down
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
To just talk tonight
If you’re feeling kinda crazy, turn down the lights
We can take our time, do whatever you like
It’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
If this is what it’s like falling in love
Then I don’t ever wanna grow up
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
It’d be fine if it was the two of us
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up

You make me feel like I got it all
And you make me feel like I’m just a kid in love
And you make me feel like I got it all
And you make me feel like I don’t ever wanna grow up

Maybe we’re just kids in love
Maybe we’re just kids in love, oh baby
If this is what it’s like falling in love
Then we don’t ever have to grow up
Maybe we’re just kids in love
Maybe we’re just kids in love, oh baby
When we’re alone and it’s the two of us
I can’t get enough
I’ve got it all, yeah yeah, I’ve got it all, yeah
And I’ve got it, and I’ve got it all
And I’ve got it, and we’ve got it all
And I’ve got it, and I’ve got it all, but I don’t ever wanna grow up27Embed
