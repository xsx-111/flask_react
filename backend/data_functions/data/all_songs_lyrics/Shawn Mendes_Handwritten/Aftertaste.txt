Aftertaste Lyrics
Re-rewind Friday night, never forget it, how you let me go
No more lies, I'll be fine, know where I'm headed, probably shoulda known
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me"
Fool me once, told you twice, gonna regret it, now you're all alone, yeah

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

Close your eyes, you can't hide, try to forget me, but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets you weren't ready when you left me there
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me"
Yeah, bet it hurts it gets worse, you know nobody, said it would be fair, oh

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

And now there's something in your way
'Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day
And it hurts 'cause
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste and the aftertaste46Embed
