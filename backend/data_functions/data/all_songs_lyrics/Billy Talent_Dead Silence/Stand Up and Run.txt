Stand Up and Run Lyrics
Oh, I had a feeling buried inside
Covered beneath a blanket of pride
Oh, I couldn't tell you how my heart felt inside
In so little time

Stand up and run, stand up and run
Stand up and run, stand up and run
Oh, into my arms

Chasing the bright lights, this city got old
You walked out of my life and into the cold
It's hard to imagine that you'd never come home
Forever alone

Stand up and run, stand up and run
Stand up and run, stand up and run
Into my arms
Stand up and run, stand up and run
Stand up and run, stand up and run
Oh, into my heart

Can't you see there is no logic to love
And we're lost just like the stars up above
If I'd only known how you'd make me feel
I would kiss the ground that touches your heel
After all these years of being apart
Don't let reason try to tear us apart
(Stand up and run, stand up and run) If the compass breaks, then follow your heart
(Stand up and run, stand up and run) And I hope it leads you right back into my arms
(Stand up and run, stand up and run) If the time has past you'll still make it last
(Stand up and run, stand up and run) And I hope this leads you right back into my arms
Oh, into my arms
Oh, I had a feeling buried inside1Embed
