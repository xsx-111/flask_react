Lonely Road to Absolution LyricsThe song has born a brand new day
Conscience has been cast away
Evil has been blessed with praise
Heroes end up in their graves
So who will be our savior now?
They've shot your angels to the ground
It's a lonely road to absolution we must walk alone
It's a lonely road to absolution we must walk alone
We can't take back, the days we've borrowed
No more time to kill tomorrow
No more time to kill tomorrow2Embed
