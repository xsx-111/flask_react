Love Was Still Around LyricsAlive!
And right before your eyes
It's easy to think twice
A choice can change your life
Angry fists, angry eyes
Thought you'd take them by surprise
And unleash all your demons upon them
With your guns and your knives
Left them fighting to survive
You're the villain but you played the victim
Never took no advice
Did you ever realize
That your violence had taken your virtue
Well, you can't wash away
The mistakes of yesterday
When the boys wearing blue come to greet you
And I can hear the sirens still calling your name
And I can see the ashes rise up from the flames
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
Did you stop and regret?
When the voice inside your head
Got so quiet that you'd hear a pin drop
Did you still like the view
When their guns were aimed at you
Screaming "Out of the house with your hands up!"
Now you wait in the line
For the prison bell to chime
Singing "I fought the law but the law won"
When you're done serving time
You can look them in the eyes
While you count all the live that you've broken
And I can hear the sirens still calling your name
And I can see the ashes rise up from the flames
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
And I can see the flashing lights take you away
And now the tears are rolling down your mother's face
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
When love was still around
When love was still around
Some day you'll see the life that you turned down
Alive!
And I can hear the sirens still calling your name
And I can see the ashes rise up from the flames
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
And I can see the flashing lights take you away
And now the tears are rolling down your mother's face
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
When love was still around
When love was still around
Some day you'll see the life that you turned down
Alive!
And right before your eyes
It's easy to think twice
A choice can change your life1Embed
