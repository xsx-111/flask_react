Dead Silence Lyrics
We're living underneath the land of sorrow
I can hear the bombs rain down
And how do I explain there's no tomorrow
I can hardly make a sound

Dead silence, a fate we can't escape
'Till death do us part in the end

They're marching up the main street as my heart beats
Louder than machine gun fire
The sound of all the sirens sing like violins
Rattling the cold barbwire
I heard the soldiers say, "Don't let them get away"
But I could not escape their bullets and grenades
A casualty of war, a victim of mistake
Another widow has been made

Dead silence will come to rescue me
When violence has took this world away
Dead silence, a fate we can't escape
'Till death do us part in the end
Dead silence will come to rescue me
When violence has took this world away
Dead silence, no time to be afraid
My love, I will see you again
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Fly away like the wind
Some things God can't forgive
Why is war justified
While the innocent die?
They can tear us apart
I'll still live in your heart
If your spirit gives up
Don't surrender your love
And the world will survive
If we stand side by side
One day, hope will arrive
Now I must say goodbye

Dead silence will come to rescue me
When violence has took this world away
Dead silence, a fate we can't escape
'Till death do us part in the end
Dead silence will come to rescue me
When violence has took this world away
Dead silence, no time to be afraid
My love, I will see you again
Dead silence will come to rescue me
When violence has took this world away
Dead silence, a fate we can't escape
'Till death do us part in the end
Dead silence will come to rescue me
When violence has took this world away
Dead silence, no time to be afraid
My love, I will see you again

Dead silence
When violence
Dead silence
Dead silence
When violence
Dead silence
(Dead silence
When violence
Dead silence)2Embed
