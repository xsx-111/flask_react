Show Me the Way LyricsPut me on an aeroplane
A million miles away
She's opened up her book of hate
And tore a brand new page
Tonight I'll find a wishing well
Tomorrow's a new day
Tonight I'll find a wishing well, before it's too late…
Show me the way, show me the way!
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
Show me the way, show me the way!
Spent a whole lifetime running away
She questioned my ability
To learn from my mistake
I said she'd need a guillotine
To put me in my place
Tonight I'll write my eulogy, before I fade away
Tonight I'll write my eulogy, so don't be afraid…
Show me the way! Show me the way!
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
Show me the way! Show me the way!
Spent a whole lifetime running away
And every time I close my eyes, i've lost another day
Show me the way! Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
The waves came crashing, down so fast
That when the storm was over, the sky turned black
And now I pray for sunshine! I pray for sunshine
I pray you'll help me to escape!
Show me the way, show me the way!
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
Show me the way, show me the way!
Spent a whole lifetime running away
And every time I close my eyes i've lost another day
Show me the way, show me the way!
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
And every time we close our eyes we've lost another day
Every time we close our eyes, our dreams will have to waitEmbed
