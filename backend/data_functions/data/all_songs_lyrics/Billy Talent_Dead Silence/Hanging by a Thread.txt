Hanging by a Thread Lyrics
Hello, hello, hello my darling, have we reached the end?
Cause when the stitches fall apart we're hanging by a thread

Hello, hello, hello my darling, some things never change
When our words are dipped in gasoline, our love goes up in flames
I tried so hard to get behind your mental barricade
But every time it leaves me feeling damaged, torn, and frayed

Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
When you break my heart, I fall apart 'til you stitch me up again

I'm tired of all the drama that unravels in your head
Well, it's easy to get tangled up when your world is torn to shreds
And every time you spit at me, some day you will regret
An ounce of insecurity is worth a pound of lead

Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
When you break my heart, I fall apart 'til you stitch me up again
Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
C'mon patch me up, or cut me loose, 'cause these rags are turning red
C'mon patch me up, or cut me loose, 'cause I'm hanging by a thread
I'm torn to shreds

Hello, hello, hello my darling, have we reached the end?
'Cause when the stitches fall apart we're hanging by a thread
For all the times we've hurt each other, with all the things we've said
Well, it's hard to hold this olive branch with a gun against my head

Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
When you break my heart, I fall apart 'til you stitch me up again
Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
C'mon patch me up, or cut me loose, 'cause these rags are turning red
C'mon patch me up, or cut me loose, 'cause I'm hanging by a thread3Embed
