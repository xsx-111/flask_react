Swallowed Up by the Ocean Lyrics
We spent a life together
That should have lasted forever
But now it's time to sail on
So take this anchor from my heart
So we can finally drift apart
Before we drown in sorrow
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

I gave you sanctuary
Under the sun we lived carefree
I tried so hard to love you
But then you turned your back on me
Your good intentions turned to greed
And now it's good to know that you have been

Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
The bluest skies turned into grey
Through tortured eyes I watched you change
Our paradise went up in flames
And though I cried a thousand times
You didn't hear the rising tide
There's nowhere left to hide since you have been


Your devastation took its toll
As the waves came crashing to the coast
This sinking ship I'm taking back from your control
It felt so good to cross my arms
And renounce my faith in mankind
How could you ever be so blind
To think that you'd survive?

Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
I hope you know that nothing matters now that you have been
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
I hope you know this ship has finally come to rest
I hope you know this ship has finally come to rest
I hope you know some day this ship will be your end3Embed
