Viking Death March Lyrics
Down, let's take it down – raise up their heads on a stake
We will show no mercy on evolution's mistake
Change will have to wait, if we can't decide on a fate
Self-appointed prophets and their doomsday charade
You preach about love and teach about faith
But all your beliefs are still rooted in hate

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall

Stop, punch in the clock – punch it with all of your rage
Put the man in office for a minimum wage
Rats, fighting for scraps, siphon the gas from your tank
Left your pockets empty, as they laugh to the bank
They speak about trust but make no mistake
They're shaking your hand while they spit in your face

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Now, the time is now, we can still turn it around
Raise your voice like a weapon, 'til they fall to the ground
Light, let there be light without a shadow of doubt
We will fight tooth and nail until salvation is found
So how can you look the world in the eyes
When all we can see is corruption and lies

Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Crackin' the whip on the backs of the poor
We asked you to stop but you still wanted more
The blood on your hands left a trail as you crawl
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you just don't look so tall

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Open your eyes and the empire falls10Embed
