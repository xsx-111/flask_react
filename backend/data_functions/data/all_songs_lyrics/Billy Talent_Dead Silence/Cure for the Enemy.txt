Cure for the Enemy Lyrics
Time
Drifts through the sky
Without a reason why
We walk past the flowers
Don't stop for a breath
Until they're above our heads
We used to fight
Have we made amends?
Father I just can't tell
Watching you spend
The time you have left
Trapped in a cold blue bed

In darkness we'll rest
Count the days down to one last breath
In darkness we'll rest
So forgive what you can't forget

We said
That we would call
But we never spoke at all
The years drifted by
We've built up these walls
For reasons that seem so small
If this is the end
Let's bury the past
This might be our one last chance
Together until
The last grain of sand
Has dropped from the hourglass
(So open your eyes) Open your eyes and don't forget to breathe
(If we lose the fight) If we lose the fight, your spirit will live through me
(It's time we make right) It's time we make right the pages of history
(Until we find) Until we find a cure for the enemy

All those you've loved
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
All those you've loved
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky




(In darkness we'll rest) All those you've loved
(Count the days down to one last breath) All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
(In darkness we'll rest) All those you've loved
(So forgive what you can't forget) All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky
(In darkness we'll rest)8Embed
