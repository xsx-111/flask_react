Crooked Minds LyricsCrooked minds have gone astray
Have they never learned from yesterday?
Only a fool would wear the crown
One day the kids will tear it down
Yeah
Can't you see the clocks are ticking away?
They try to fit more hours into the day
To see that you was crunching numbers away
We're running out breath just to keep up the pace
And when did the revolver start the race?
When did the revolver start the race?
Accelerated architecture creates
A manufactured lifestyle for the deranged
They swallow up the green and build up the gray
And let tomorrow's kids dispose of today
And when do you think the roof will bottom out?
When do you think the roof will bottom out?
Crooked minds under gray skies
They can't live 'till something dies (The kids will tear it down)
'Till something dies (The kids will tear it down)
Crooked minds ain't satisfied
'Till the ground touches the sky (The kids will tear it down)
Touches the sky (The kids will tear it down)
Cemetery statue stare into space
Sucked into a social media craze
They're looking for an answer to explain
The reason why disaster strikes again
A picture perfect family sits at the lake
Swimming in a sea of mechanical waste
And can't they see a tragedy awaits?
Can't they see a tragedy awaits?
Crooked minds under gray skies
They can't live 'till something dies (The kids will tear it down)
'Till something dies (The kids will tear it down)
Crooked minds ain't satisfied
'Till the ground touches the sky (The kids will tear it down)
Touches the sky (The kids will tear it down)
We'll tear it down
Cauterize these blood-shot eyes
Tangled in their power lines
Tear the ground up with their lives
Raise the caskets in the sky
Someday soon we'll realise
Nothing's left for you and I
Nothing's left for you and I
Crooked minds have gone astray
Have they never learned from yesterday?
Only a fool would wear the crown
One day the kids will tear it down
Crooked minds under gray skies
They can't live 'till something dies (The kids will tear it down)
'Till something dies (The kids will tear it down)
Crooked minds ain't satisfied
'Till the ground touches the sky (The kids will tear it down)
Touches the sky (The kids will tear it down)
Cauterize these butchered eyes
Tangled in their power lines
Tear the ground up with their lives
Raise the caskets in the sky
Someday soon we'll realise
Nothing lives 'till something dies (The kids will tear it down)
'Till something dies (The kids will tear it down)
'Till something dies1Embed
