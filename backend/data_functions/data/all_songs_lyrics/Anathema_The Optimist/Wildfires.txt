Wildfires
The eye in the sky
The eye in the sky
The who, the when, the why
Who am I?

The eye in the sky
The eye in the sky
The who, the when, the why
Who am I?
The eye in the sky
The eye in the sky
The who, the when, the why
Who am I?
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
Too late
Too late
Too late
Too late
Too late
Too late
Too late
Too late
