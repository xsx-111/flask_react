Endless Ways LyricsHold on, hold on for dear life
And run, and run all night
For you are loved in endless ways
Stay with me, please believe
I can't be your memory
My world will never be the same
And my heart is never going to regret
For you are loved in endless ways
Are loved in endless ways
Hold on, hold on for dear life
And run, and run all night
For you are loved in endless ways
Are loved in endless ways
There’s no way of knowing
What could be waiting
There’s no way of knowing
The dream I’m creating
There’s no way of knowing
The dream I’m creating
The dream I’m creating
The dream I’m creating
The dream I’m creating
The dream I’m creating
The dream I’m creating
The dream I’m creating
The dream I’m creating
The dream I’m creating
The dream I’m creating
The dream I’m creating3Embed
