Ghosts LyricsYou, saw you
Yes you, saw you
Trick of the light
Star from the night
Tired and confused
Saw you, saw you
Slow down, slow down
Please, slow down
Trick of the light
Star from the night
Tired and confused
Reminded of you
Trick of the light
Star from the night
Tired and confused
Saw you
Saw you
Saw you
Saw you1Embed
