Close Your Eyes LyricsClose your eyes
Close your eyes
Sleep tonight
Sleep tonight
And dream on
Just dream on
For the dark roads
For the dark roads
For you and I
Yes you and I
Which way to go
Which way to go
All that you need is inside
And all that you need is inside
And what do you see when you turn on the lights?
It's okay, it's okay
It's just a dream
Go back to sleep1Embed
