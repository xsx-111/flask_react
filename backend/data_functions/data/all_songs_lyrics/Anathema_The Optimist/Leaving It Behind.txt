Leaving It Behind LyricsTonight, let go
Let go of everything inside
Cause I said so
We’ll make everything inside alright
Cause I am leaving it behind
Stop feeling dead inside tonight
Cause I’m leaving it behind
Stop feeling satisfied inside
The lies, they know
They know every little thing inside
But I said no
And I’ll make everything inside alright
Cause I am leaving it behind
Stop feeling dead inside tonight
Cause I’m leaving it behind
Stop feeling satisfied inside
Tonight, let go
Let go of everything inside
Cause I said so
We’ll make everything inside alright
Cause I am leaving it behind
Stop feeling dead inside tonight
Cause I’m leaving it behind
Stop feeling satisfied insideEmbed
