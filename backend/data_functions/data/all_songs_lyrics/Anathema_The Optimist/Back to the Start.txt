Back to the Start LyricsThey don't understand
They don't understand
They don't understand
They don't understand
And all I need
Is you
Just all I need
Is you
They don't understand
'Cause they don't talk for me
There ain't no master plan
I came in to make peace
I'm only made to suffer
I'm only made to care
And all the time in the world
Gonna wish you 'til it hurts
'Cause they don't understand
And all I need is you
But you don't know it's true
And all I need is you
You don't know it's true
It's impossible
Unbelievable
Do you see it now?
Do you see it now?
And our lives going back to the start3Embed
