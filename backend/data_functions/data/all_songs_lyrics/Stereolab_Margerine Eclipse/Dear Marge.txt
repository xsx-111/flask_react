Dear Marge LyricsIn this mess
Precious dust

Guard the gods
Guard the judges
Din of geometric chaos
The chaos
What a mess
The precious dust

The chaos
What a mess
The precious dust
Gather strength, the softness
Guard the gods
The judges
Contort the geometric chaos

Govern it too?
To open up

The joy to love
To know to learn
Are the essence
Of existence
And so couldn't they
Govern it too?
The joy to love
To open upEmbed
