Feel and Triple LyricsGoodbye Mary
Goodbye Mary
Memory of a friend
Memory I need to embrace
Fallen out
Fallen out
Fallen out
Of our time and space
Memory
Of a friend
Memory
All the aches, pains and the joys
Of growing up beside you
Dancing a spontaneous
A dance with you
Your spirit lives
As you have spread the seed
Of love
Love of life
Dark and bright
Love of life
Loved to laugh
Love of life
Dark and bright
Dark and bright
It took years to intimate (I remember)
But finally love found its way (I remember)
Unimpeded it could exist (A victory)
So fun, so free
Love of life
Dark and bright
Love of life
Loved to laugh
Love of life
Dark and bright
Dark and bright
It took years to intimate (I remember)
But finally love found its way (I remember)
Unimpeded it could exist (A victory)
So fun, so free
As much
As I don't want
I have to say goodbye
You
Will
Sing
For
Ever
Like
An
Angel
Who
Flew away1Embed
