Margerine Rock LyricsThe beauty of this creature could only be equaled by
The extent of its paradox only be equaled by
Because it wanted two things, opposite and conflicting
It wanted the light, it wanted everything in sight
Wanted to dominate or at least to participate
But only in comforts of its chair and its slippers
The curiosity of the extra-ordinary creature
Was indeed limited because it could not suffer
The unknown in any shape or form
At the same time of wanting to look everywhere
Set up at the top of its tower
The creature reveled in being a spectator
Through the glass, what a glorious view
Relishing the gift of so much transparence
Relishing the gift of so much transparence
Having had absolutely no influenceEmbed
