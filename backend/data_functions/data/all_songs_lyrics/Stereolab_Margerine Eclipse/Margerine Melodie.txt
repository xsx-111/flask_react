Margerine Melodie LyricsWhen two people have a project
They begin a competition
In which there will be a winner and a loser
State of dominance over one or the other
This dominance is integral to
All human's ways and actions
The necessity to keep at disposition
An object or being desired by another
Knowing through training that if he wants to keep it
Learning everyday, he will have to dominate
Our brain makes us act
Behave and react
A pulsion that drives us to stay alive
Need to satisfy our fundamental needs
The nervous system enables that drive
Through consumerism, escape and struggle
As well as inhibition
All these mechanisms that preserve balance
Biological well being
Seems that until now we have used our brain
Just to dominate, just to dominate
Knowing through training that if he wants to keep it
Learning everyday, he will have to dominate
When two people have a project
They begin a competition
We've to widen the knowledge of
How our brain works to understand
Or nothing will, will ever change
(?)Will to an end
Give birth without seizing
Act and expect nothing
They flower let them free
Unite with the dust and be
Give birth without seizing
Act and expect nothing
They flower let them free
Unite with the dust and beEmbed
