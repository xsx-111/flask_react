Yo, what's up wit this Pac Man nigga?
Yo, what's up?
(Yo, look right there)
Yo, hold up, hold up
Yo Pac Man, yo Pac Man
Yo, you know me money?
Listen dog, I don't know you and all that shit
But what's up with this Pac Man shit?
What you mean, "What's up with this Pac Man shit"?
This my hood man, this my hood for five years, man
Just got out, man, I'm just trying to get some money, man
Yo, I want you to get money and all that shit, but you can't get it here, man
What you mean I can't get it here? I been here all my mutherfucking life, B
Ain't none of y'all N.Y. niggas taking over this shit up around here, man
How the fuck you know I'm a New York nigga?
You smell like a New York nigga to me, man
Five years ago, where was you?
Five years ago, I was locked up man
You born and raised in this joint?
Born and raised here, my momma here, my poppa here, everybody here!
Well, we was born up the block
Ya, I was born and raised here and ain't none of y'all niggas gonna run me out of my hood!
So what you saying, nigga?
Nigga, what you saying, nigga?
This what the fuck I'm saying: *gunshot*
Ride or Die, motherfucker!6Embed
