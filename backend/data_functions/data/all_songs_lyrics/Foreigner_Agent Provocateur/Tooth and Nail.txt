Tooth and Nail Lyrics
I'm tired of all this cheap talk
When you walk next to me
They say I ain't good enough for you
Why don't they come and tell me
When they see us out in the night
They can't wait to tear us apart
Now I hear them saying loving you ain't right
Well they'd better be ready because honey I'll be there

I will fight tooth and nail
Count on me, I will not fail you
I will fight tooth and nail

They say I'm always breaking promises
And I'm just fooling with you
Then they try and come between the two of us
Man, that's a bad thing to do
I can say I had more than enough
But I ain't going to take it too hard
I said hey, they want to play rough
Well let's see who backs down when the trouble starts

Come on try me, I won't give in
They take advantage, but they can't win
I'll be your man, baby, wait and see
Ain't nobody, nobody take your love from me


I'll be your man, baby, wait and see
Ain't nobody, nowhere take your love away from me


Right now, tooth and nail
I am waiting for the fight
Tooth and nail
Right now, come on, tooth and nail
Right now, tooth and nail
Come on, tooth and nail
Ah fight
Tooth and nail
Right now, come on, tooth and nail
Come on, right now, tooth and nail1Embed
