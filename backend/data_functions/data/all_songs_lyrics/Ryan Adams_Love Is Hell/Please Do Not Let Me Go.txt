Please Do Not Let Me Go Lyrics
If the walls in the room could talk
I wonder to myself would they lie
It's like some kind of jail, beams of light
Fall from the curtains onto the bed

I'm all alone now, I can do as I please
I don't feel like doing much of anything

True love ain't that hard to find
Not that you will ever know
Would you lay here for awhile?
Please, do not let me go
Please, do not let me go

You were sweet enough to sing
Oblivious to melody
Red suitcase full of clothes
Washed up on the shore of memory

I'm all alone now, I can do as I please
I don't feel like doing much of anything
True love ain't that hard to find
Not that either one of us will ever know
Would you lay here for awhile?
Please, do not let me go
Please, do not let me goEmbed
