Anybody Wanna Take Me Home (Love is Hell Version) Lyrics
So I am in the twilight of my youth
Not that I'm going to remember
And have you seen the moon tonight, is it full?
Still burning in it's embers

The people dancing in the corner
They seem happy but I am sad
I'm still dancing in the coma of the drinks I just had

Does anybody wanna take me home?
Does anybody wanna take me home?
Take me to your house and I'll leave you alone
Of course I will
Of course I won't
It seems so tragic
But it disappeared like magic
Like magic
Like magic

Can you recommend an education or drugs?
Because I'm bored with you already
I'm on Broadway and I think it's a parade
I'm covered in pieces of confetti
Now I am in the twilight of my youth
Not that I'm going to remember
Dancing in slowly and finding the truth
And it's covered in coma
All these people in my life
Well they seem so in love
Well I am not
Memorizing my shoes in a cigarette shop

Does anybody wanna take me home?
Does anybody wanna take me home?
I'm kinda lonely, will you take me home?
Of course you will
Of course you won't
Of course I'm crass
It seems so tragic
Of course you will
Of course you won't
But I'll disappear
I'll disappear
Just like magic
Just like magic
Just like magicEmbed
