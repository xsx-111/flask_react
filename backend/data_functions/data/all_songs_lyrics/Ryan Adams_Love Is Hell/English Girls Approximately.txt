English Girls Approximately Lyrics
English girls are pretty when they play guitar
Crazy like a day just a-breaking I ain't sure what for
Ain't got a mother or father or a place to fall
She got a brother in the blues, but he doesn't know the blues at all

Said you didn't love me, it was right on time
I was just about to tell you but okay, alright
Said you didn't love me, didn't want a thing
English girls can be so mean

She's got eyes as pretty as a pair of jewels
Falling down a canyon like a couple drunken criminals
She had a messy bedroom on the edge on the town
But I ain't ever been good enough to ever keep around

Said you didn't love me, it was right on time
I was just about to tell you but okay, alright
Said you didn't love me, didn't mean a thing
English girls can be so mean

But, ohh, look at you now
Ohh, look at you now
Mmmm, best I ever seen
Just a tall drink of water, just a-pourin' on down the sink
Tall drink of water, she's a Norfolk waterfall
Little day-breaker, she's a shootin' like a cannonball
Crazy like a rocket when you're coming through my radio
Kept me in your bed till the wintertime turned to fall
Fall time coming, and I guess my little bird can sing
Come on Elizabeth, a come on a Bethany
Come on further, I'm tired and I want to sleep
My little dove flew, and I guess that she was done with me

Said you didn't love me, it was right on time
I was just about to tell you but okay, alright
Said you didn't love me, didn't want a thing
English girls can be so mean

But ohh, look at you now
Ohh, look at you now
Mmmm, best I've ever seen
Just a tall drink of water, just a-pourin' on down the sink

Kiss me on the lips but my heart just slept it off
Words may move, but they're never moving fast enough
Celebrate the differences, I celebrate the songs you sing
Just three words, my love: you meant everything
You meant everything
You meant everything
You meant everythingEmbed
