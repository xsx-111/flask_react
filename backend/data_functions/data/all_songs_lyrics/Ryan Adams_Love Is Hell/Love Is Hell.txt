Love Is Hell Lyrics
Strange weather in the back of the room
She's pretty, Jesse's spinnin' the tunes
Eyelashes and some white leather boots
God what have I been drinking?

I could be serious but I'm just kidding around
I could be anything, anything but sticking around

Love is Hell
Love is Hell
Love is Hell
Is Hell

It's raining I can see it outside
Funny, I'm still in it
Just sitting here with Johnny and Raph
Oh, till the room starts spinning

I could be serious but I'm just kidding around
I could be anything, nothing, whatever, oh well
Love is Hell
Love is Hell
Love is Hell

Love is Hell
Love is Hell
Love is Hell
Love is Hell
Love is Hell
Love is Hell
Love is HellEmbed
