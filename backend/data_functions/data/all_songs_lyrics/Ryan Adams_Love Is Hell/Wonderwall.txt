Wonderwall Lyrics
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna give it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never bring it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're could have be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwallEmbed
