I See Monsters Lyrics
Baby, I know you cannot hear me now
'Cause you're fast asleep
But I love you now
Colors inside your head go spinning around
Like a Ferris wheel
Exploding and falling to the ground

Ooh, people are screaming, people are screaming
My baby, she's dreaming
Oh, people are shouting, people are freaking
I'm staring at the ceiling
Waiting for the feeling

But oh, oh when she calls
I know that she's the one
Makes me want it harder
Makes me want to be a little stronger
Still I see monsters
Still I see monsters

Baby, I know you cannot hear me now
'Cause you're far away
At the speed of sound
Colors inside your head go spinning around
Like a Ferris wheel
Exploding and falling to the ground
Ooh, people are screaming, people are screaming
My baby, she's dreaming
Ooh, people are shouting, people are freaking
I'm staring at the ceiling
Waiting for the feeling

Oh, when she calls
I know that she's the one
Makes me want it harder
Makes me want to be a little stronger
Still I see monsters
Still I see monstersEmbed
