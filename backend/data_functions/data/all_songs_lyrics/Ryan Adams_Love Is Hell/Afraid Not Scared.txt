Afraid Not Scared Lyrics
Look at this ocean with everyone drowning
Idiots screaming and everyone sinking in slowly
We're surrounded
In the yellow lights of the city wasted as bodies
In bed with somebody a touch away with nothing to do
We're surrounded

I'm really dying in here
I'm really dying in here
And I'm afraid, no I'm scared

She started freezing, lungs all collapsing
The momentum is passing, but the moment is eating us whole
We're surrounded
Put the guns in the water, they're turning to vodka
Triggering nothing we're sinking the sea takes the ship

And I'm really dying in here
I'm really dying in here
I'm afraid, I'm afraid
No, I'm scared, no I'm scared
I'm just scared, just let me down
I'm getting really cold and I'm looking at you
You're not moving
I'm getting really cold and I'm looking at you
You're not moving
I'm getting really cold and I'm looking at you
And you're not movingEmbed
