This House Is Not for Sale Lyrics
Tell 'em that the house is not for sale
We're still livin' here, how come nobody can tell?
They're taking all the furniture, movin' our things
Come on little honey, put your head on my knee
Tell 'em that the house is not for sale

And calm down, calm down, calm down
Calm down, calm down, calm down

Do you remember when we even bought this thing?
I danced you across the wooden floor and
Then you signed the lease
What happened in the car that night?
What happened in the car that night?
Tell 'em that the house is not for sale

Calm down, calm down, calm down
Calm down, calm down, calm down
Calm down

Tell 'em that the house is not for sale
We could grab a couple sheets, yeah and give 'em quite a scare
I remember lyin' on the bedroom floor
You were holding me honey, kissing my soul
Tell 'em that the house is not for sale
And calm down, calm down, calm down
Calm down, calm down, calm down
Calm down
Calm downEmbed
