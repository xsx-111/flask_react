Thank You Louise Lyrics
Everyone, when she was young
They said she was the pretty one
She's pretty now, just watch her as she goes
Waiting for the bus to come
She holds the hand of someone young
Whose mother comes and sees her and she smiles

Thank you Louise
Mary Louise
Mother of three

Waiting in the check-out line
The supermarket, Christmas time
She eyes someone who doesn't have the change
Takes a dollar from her purse
She pays and doesn't says a word
And winks and grins and 'Merry Christmas, friend!'

Thank you Louise
Mary Louise
Mother of three
In Baltimore, the freezing cold
That chills her daughter to the bone
She walks from work and cops the drugs and leaves
Her brother lay upon the bed
With busted teeth and broken head
He hears the phone and he knows his brother's dead

Thank you Louise
Mary Louise
Mother of twoEmbed
