Trouble No More Lyrics
Don't care how long you go
I don't care how long you stay
It's good kind treatment
Bring you home someday
Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble
Poor me anymore

Now you keep on betting
That the dice won't pass
Well I know, and I know, whoa
Oh you're living too fast
Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble
Poor me anymore

Now I'll tell everybody
In my neighborhood
You're a kind little woman
But you don't do me no good
But someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble
Poor me anymore

I know you're leaving
If you call that gone
Oh without my loving, yeah
Naw ya can't stay long
But someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble
Poor me anymore
Yeah yeah


Well good bye baby
Yeah now take my hand
I don't want no woman no
Can't have no man
But someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble
Poor me anymore

Trouble no more
Yeah yeah
Yeah baby1Embed
