Sleigh Ride LyricsJust hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring, ting, tingling, too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with youEmbed
