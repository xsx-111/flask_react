Stay Positive Lyrics
'Cause this world swallows souls
And when the blues unfold, it gets cold, solids burns holes
You're going mad, perhaps you always were
But when things was good, you just didn't care
This is called irony
When you most need to get up, you got no energy
Time and time, shit'll happen, the dark shit's unwrapping
But no-one's listening, your mates are laughing
Your bredren's fucking and then you start hating
Your stomach starts churning and your mind starts turning
So smoke another draw
It won't matter no more, but the next day still feels sore
Rain taps on your window, always did though
But you didn't hear it when things was so-so
You're on your own now, your little zone
You were born alone and believe me, you'll die alone
Weed becomes a chore
You want the buzz back so you follow the others onto smack

Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Feels nice and still
Good thing about brown is it always will
It's easy, no-one blames you
It's that world out there that's fucked you
You're no less of a person and if God exists, He still loves you
Just remember that
The more you sink, the further back from that brink
Maybe you have lifetime scars
And you think tattoos might be more fitting, but who's picking?
Searching for yourself, you find demons
Try and be a free man and grasp that talisman
'Cause you're the same as I am
We all need our fellow man, we all need our Samaritan
Maybe I'm better looking than you, though
Maybe I've got more dough, but am I happier? No
Get the love of a good girl
And your world will be much richer than my world
And your happiness will uncurl

Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
"Stop dreaming"
People who say that are blaspheming
They're doing nine-to-five and moaning
And they don't want you succeeding when they've blown it
And your idols â€“ who are they?
They, too, dreamt about their day
Positive steps will see your goals
Whether it's dollars or control, feel the gold
I ain't helping you climb the ladder, I'm busy climbing mine
That's how it's been since the dawn of time
If you reach a cul-de-sac, the world turns it's back
This is your zone, it's like blackjack
He might get the ace or the top one
So organise your twos and threes into a run
And then you'll have fucked him, son
And for that, you'll be the better one
One last thing before you go, though
When you feel better tomorrow, you'll be a hero
But never forget today
You could be back here, things can stray
But what if you see me in that window?
You won't help me, I know
That's cool, just keep walking where you go
Carry on through the estate
Stare at the geezers so they know you ain't lightweight
And go see your mates
And when they don't look happy
Play 'em this tape
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive

I hope you understand me
I ain't no preaching fucker and I ain't no do-goody-goody either
This is about when shit goes pear-shaped
And if you aren't, or never have been at rock bottom
Then good luck to you in the big wide world
But remember that one day, shit might just start crumbling
Your bird might fuck off or you might lose your job
It's when that happens that what I'm talking about
Will feel much more important to you
So if you ain't feeling it
Just be thankful that things are cool in your world
