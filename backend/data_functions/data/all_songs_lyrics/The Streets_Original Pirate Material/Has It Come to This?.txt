Has It Come to This? Lyrics
Has it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh
Original Pirate Material
You're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial
Has it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh
Original Pirate Material
You're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial

Make yourself at home
We got diesel or some of that homegrown
Sit back in your throne and turn off your phone
'Cause this is our zone
Videos, televisions
64s, PlayStations
Weigh up Henry with precision
Few herbs and a bit of Benson
But don't forget the Rizla
Lean like the Tower of Pisa
These are, I'll raise ya
And this is the day in the life of a geezer
For this ain't a club track
Pull out your sack and sit back
Whether you white or black
Smoke weed, chase brown or toot rock
We're on a mission, support the cause
Sign a petition, summon all your wisdom
The music's a gift from
The man on high, the Lord and his children
Triple team here of rudeboys
Come rain or snow, the boodah flows
You don't know? Stand on the corner, watch the show
'Cause life moves slow
Sort your shit out then roll
Sex, drugs and on the dole
Some men rise, some men fall
I hear your call, stand tall now
Has it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh
Original Pirate Material
You're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial
Has it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh
Original Pirate Material
You're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial

I'm just spitting, think I'm ghetto?
Stop dreaming, my data's streaming
I'm giving your bird them feelings
Touch your toes then touch the ceiling
We walk the tightrope of street cred
Keep my dogs fed, all jungle, all garage heads
Gold teeth, Valentinos and dreads now
We were verbally slapped up
Physically tip-top, spinally ripped up
I do the science on my laptop
And I get my boys mashed up
You're listening to The Streets
You'll bear witness to some amazing feats
Bravery in the face of defeat
All line up and grab your seat
'Cause Tony's got a new motor
SR Nova, driving like a joyrider
Speeding to the corner
Your mother warned ya, it's a sound system banger
Has it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh
Original Pirate Material
You're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial
Has it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh
Original Pirate Material
You're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial

My Underground train runs from Mile End to Ealing
From Brixton to Bounds Green
My spitting's dirty, my beats are clean
So smoke weed and be lean
I step out my yard through the streets
In the dead heat, all I got's my spirit and my beats
I play fair, don't cheat and keep the gangsters sweet
Turn the page, don't rip it out at your age, move to the next stage
Lock the rage inside the cage, like SK, it's a new day
But don't take the shortcut through the subway
It's pay or play, these geezers walk the gangway
Deep seated urban decay, deep seated urban decay
Rip down posters I like from last week's big garage night
And the next Tyson fight
I cook 'em at 90 degrees Fahrenheit and don't copy the copyright
I got 'em in my sights
Blinding with the lights, taken to dizzy new heights
Blinding with the lights, blinding with the lights
Dizzy new heights
Has it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh
