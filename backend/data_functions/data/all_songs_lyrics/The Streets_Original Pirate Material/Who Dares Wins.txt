Who Dares Wins Lyrics
It's who dares wins in the city
Sit pretty
Locked On, not Tripoli
Get dressed for the party
As I spit simile after simile
Got the latest Nikes on my feet
The streets merely reflect this bass line and beat
Lock on to 102.6, The Streets
Kronenbourg, double doves and herbs
Actions speak louder than words
Get fucked up, sat on the kerb, street geezers
Accept me as your own
Let me make myself at home
I just ain't a clone
Still got the Monsta Boy ringtone though
Raised as a Northern star
With a London Underground Travelcard1Embed
