Geezers Need Excitement Lyrics
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense

Out the club about three, to the takeaway
The shit-in-a-tray merchants
Shop's got special perchant for the disorderly
Geezers looking ordinary and a few looking lairy
Chips fly 'round to the sound of the latest chart entry
An incendiary, waiting to blast
No harm with a contest who can throw the furthest
Behind the counter they look nervous
But carry on cutting the finest cuts of chicken
From the big spinning stick
Then over flies a chip, flips and hits you on the back
You spin 'round on the attack, "Fuck you playin' at?"
He looks like a Cheshire cat, almost falls down
Your frowns and Superman eye-lasers don't even register
By now, you wanna level this twat
And forever you're gonna regret that, your choice of path
So mash his head up and your girl's now fed up
But stop to think and it's never going to be the Jackie Chan scene
It could've been to end up
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense

So you owe someone money subbin' scunny
Best pay me, Billy, "No worries"
One-fifty on Sunday, then in some way, that turns into Wednesday
Then goes straight to pay on a hazy evening in the local bar-caf√©
What a way! What a way!
Just to recap for those at the back, this is everyday tit-for-tat
You owe your dealer and can't pay him back fee
Suddenly, he's the baddy
So you tell your mates you could have him anyway, to look geez
But he's a shady fuck, Beamer three series
Lock, stock and two fat fucks backin' him up
Can't convey enough of his desire for the paper stuff
In a blunt fashion, Billy's angry with a passion
So please just accept it ain't happenin'
And go back to your runnins
'Cause you might get yourself in trouble one of these days
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense

Get a hold of this bird after pub closing hours
Would your girl like this? No, don't think so somehow
In the winter showers
But she'll never know and your face will never show shit
This is how goes it, besides she was well fit, and who could resist?
Move up to the next place, it's a smooth club
Flex, bass, beats, and your best mates
All down, nice sound, Smirnoff Ice rounds
MCs clowning, rudeboys frowning, everything's sweet
Everything's tucked in, and 'round here, we're all downing
But all of a sudden though, just through the smoke
It's your bird laughing and joking with a bloke
Ain't just that either, as she moves closer
In a shape what looks like they're lovers, he's tonguing her!
All rage sweeps up through your torso
You're more so ready to go over and show him who's man
Football fan style, leave it in the can for awhile
'Cause even as they smile, he's still got choices
Don't listen to them voices
That at the end of the day you may just have caused this
So leave the forces
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense1Embed
