Who Got the Funk? Lyrics
Oi, oi, oi! Lee Satchell, you bastard
Stop trying to shag the birds and fight the geezers
Mine's a Kronenbourg, mate
The Streets
Yeah

Who gots the funk?
Geezers, geezers, geezers
Who gots the funk?
Original Pirate Material
Day in the life of a geezer
Crispy
Rosco
England's glory
Unique
Lyrics
Locked on
Andy Lewis

All Birmingham geezers
All London heads
Barnet, Brixton, Beckenham
You're listening to The Streets
Original Pirate Material
Day in the life of a geezer
A day in the life of a geezer
This is just a groove
Just a grooveEmbed
