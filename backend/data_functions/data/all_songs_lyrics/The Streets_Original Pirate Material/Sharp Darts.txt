Sharp Darts Lyrics
Sharp darts, spitting masters, spitting darts faster
Shut up, I'm the driver, you're the passenger
Bar brain's superior, the pressure blows the dial on your barometer
Do you understand or do you need an interpreter?

Now, my style is distinguished, all fires are extinguished
Ask your girl to sing and she'll sing this, I'm a scientist
Have no prejudice, that's my hypothesis
Make your analysis, ever heard a beat like this?
I walk the beat like a policeman, no karma pedestrian
In five-hundred years, they'll play this song in museums
I'm the bold adventurer, the UK's ambassador
Holding up Excalibur, your beats are inferior
Don't wanna embarrass ya, so call your solicitor
The jury voted unanimously against ya

Sharp darts, spitting masters, spitting darts faster
Shut up, I'm the driver, you're the passenger
Bar brain's superior, the pressure blows the dial on your barometer
Do you understand or do you need an interpreter?

Now this one's fat like your mother, contains enough calories
Resonating all your favourite frequencies
I've got a worldwide warranty, satisfaction guarantee
If you ain't happy then just send it right back to me
'Spec to BC, it's time to fuck loyalty
One day, I hope to earn some hard royalties
From a bit of sample robbery, hook burglary
Noise thievery or wholesale piracy
So watch your back, I'm inclined to sample
I'll dismantle and make you all examples
Sharp darts, spitting masters, spitting darts faster
Shut up, I'm the driver, you're the passenger
Bar brain's superior, the pressure blows the dial on your barometer
Do you understand or do you need an interpreter?
Sharp darts, spitting masters, spitting darts faster
Shut up, I'm the driver, you're the passenger
Bar brain's superior, the pressure blows the dial on your barometer
Do you understand or do you need an interpreter?Embed
