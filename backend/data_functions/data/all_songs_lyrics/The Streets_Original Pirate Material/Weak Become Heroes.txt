Weak Become Heroes Lyrics
Turn left up the street
Nothing but grey concrete and deadbeats
Grab something to eat, Maccy D's or KFC?
Only one choice in the city, done voicing my pity

Now let's get to the nitty gritty
Tune reminds me of my first E
Plight unique, still sixteen and feeling horny
Point to the sky, feel free
A sea of people all equal, smiles in front and behind me
Swim in the deep blue sea, corn fields sway lazily
All smiles, all easy
"Where ya from, what's you on and what's your story?"
Mesmerising tones, rising pianos, this is my zone, so stop cloning
Pick paper, scissors or stone
'Cause me and you are the same
I've known you all my life, I don't know your name
The name's European Bob, sorted
Anyway, we'll have a dance now, see ya later
"Pleased to meet ya"; "Likewise, a pleasure"

We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
The night slowly fades and goes slow motion
All the commotion becomes floating emotions
Same piano loops over
Arms wave, eyes roll back and jaws fall open
See in soft focus
Chatting to this bloke in the toilets
Dizzy new heights, blinded by the lights, these people are for life
It's all back to his place at the end of the night, yo
They could settle wars with this, if only they will
Imagine the world's leaders on pills
And imagine the morning after
Wars causing disaster
Don't talk to me, I don't know ya
But this ain't tomorrow, for now, I still love ya
Hours fly over
Sail 'round, diamonds and pearls
Never seen so many fit girls
Discover new worlds
Look at my watch, can't focus
Last two hours are lost
Every move fills me with lust
All of life's problems, I just shake off, yo
Mad little events happen
Things map out and a few blue maddens alight the toilets
Big beefy bouncers out to reveal us
Geezers on E's and first timers
Kids on wizz, darlings on Charlie
All comes together for this party
All races, many faces from places you've never heard of
"Where you from, what's your name and what you want?"
Sing to the words, flex to the fat ones
The tribal drums, the sun's rising
We all smile, we all sing
We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)

Then the girl in the caf√© taps me on the shoulder
I realise five years went by and I'm older
Memories smoulder, winter's colder
But that same piano loops over and over and over
The road shines and the rain washes away
Same Chinese take-away selling shit in a tray
It's dark all 'round, I walk down
Same sights, same sounds, new beats, though
Solid concrete under my feet
No surprises, no treats
The world stands still as my mind slushes 'round
The washing-up bowl in my crown
My life's been up and down since I walked from that crowd

We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
Out of respect for Johnny Walker, Paul Oakenfold
Nicky Holloway, Danny Rampling
And all the people who gave us these times
And to the government
I stick my middle finger up with regards to the Criminal Justice Bill
For all the heroes I met along the way
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)

The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)1Embed
