Park Song LyricsWoke up today a bit too late
Put on my shoes and got some coffee
Cranked out the tunes, I think it was Roxy
Went back to snooze until 8:30
Went to the bar they say is the most
Went by myself, but no one noticed
Wonder if I looked like a tourist
All that I could think was "Please don't blow this"
And we go, but they don't know us
Goes to show we're not the same
Keep it in, 'cause they don't know this
Let it out, but not today
Went to the park today
Watched all the dogs as they played
None of them barked, they just hanged
Think I'll buy a dog when I get paid
Saw the girl I know from my job
I think that she must think that I'm retarded
I act so dumb when I get started
Time to cut my hair and get it parted
And we go, but they don't know us
Goes to show we're not the same
Keep it in, 'cause they don't know this
Let it out, but not todayEmbed
