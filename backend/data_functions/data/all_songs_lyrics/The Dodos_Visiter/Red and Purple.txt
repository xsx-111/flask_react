Red and Purple Lyrics
There's nobody here
To tell us a joke
We tear off our ears
The fire that we stoke
You wrote me a note
The pages were blank
And I, I should have known
Invisible ink

I know that I am yours and you will be mine
Come and join us in the trenches
Red and purple by our side
Say you'll never leave us
In this company of mine

You carry this dirt
We stole from the source
Its tongue will be hurt
Attack from the north
The color was red
The number was six
Now you're in my head
No more to convince

I bring this back home
Just hoping I've changed
So that you will know
Just how I'm deranged
But you're off on your search
You're crying, then went to church
You're safe, or at least I heard
Until to me you return
