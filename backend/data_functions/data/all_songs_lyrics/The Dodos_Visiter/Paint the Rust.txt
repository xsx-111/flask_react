Paint the Rust Lyrics
Run into the sea before it comes
The heavy hand washing over you
I see the face of many men
Beyond the beach, drowning in the blue
They come to seek the open land
They grab a piece before others do
It's all because the master plan
We're supposed to teach only if we knew
Please...
...tell us what you want, we'll get it for you
Take...
...us movers from this place we sink ourselves to
Dark...
...ness tells us we're awake, we still can come too

Face the every day from morning's gold
To when the night tries to overcome
We'll leave this up to all of you
So that you leave, take it off and run
I see the face of every man
Of every girl that I've ever loved
They sing the same until the dawn
When we're away off into the sun
Please...
...tell us what you want, we'll get it for you
Take...
...us movers from this place we sink ourselves to
Dark...
...ness tells me I'm awake, I still can come too

Home to come
But now I only need you when I'm down
Amongst the rest
We only feed you when we're out
I won't forget, I will keep you here inside my head
Here we are
Pass the stone
Throw away
All you know
Bury it
Under dusk
Wash away
