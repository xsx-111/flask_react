The Season Lyrics
Somewhere in between this ocean and mountainside
I have this dream, I think of it still sometimes
I know it's just the season
I sense no time nor reason
The sky falls down, it's evening
The feeling goes, it's leaving

Miles until this desert brings me back to your face
Those eyes you know I think of them still sometimes
But you're away in Eden
And I'm still here, the heathen
This times for real, we're even
We do this for the season

I cross the sand without your hand
I go back to where it all began
Where I was yours and you were mine
Things seem so soon to say goodbye
I hope you're well, as I am fine
I keep to myself where I go where I lie

I woke up in a cave
No air, no light, no shade
When did things turn this way
I miss you on certain daysEmbed
