God? LyricsNo one to hold, no place to lie
I know we're all alone and still
You come to brush this gray aside
I know, I know, it's fate I feel
You answer to our hungry eyes
I hope, I hope this must be real
We need you now, we need to heal
Oh no, oh no, oh God, where'd you go?
You give us love, we have to hide
I know, I know, it's shades of gray
You give us hope and give us strife
I know, I know, this price we pay
You tell me no, I ask you why
I know, I know, your patient ways
You wait until we see the light
Oh no, oh no, oh God, where'd you go?
Oh, God
And tell us how to feel inside
No lies, no lies, no lies
And let me look upon that sign
With eyes, with eyes, with eyes
And tell me how you wear that crown
Of right, of right, of right
You lift us up then let us down
We die, we die, we die
You answer to the wrong and wide
I know, I know, the faith we feel
You give us strength and make us fight
I know, I know, we're supposed to kill
You pit us up on different sides
I know, I know, that's just your will
I wonder if you'll wait until
Oh no, oh no, this place will explode
You live above this great big sky
I hear it's nice, it's always spring
I've come to ask you for advice
I know you're busy for a king
You tell me once, I ask you twice
How long, how long, before they sing?
We did the things you said, alright
Oh no, oh no, oh God, where'd you go?
Oh, God
And tell us how to feel inside
No lies, no lies, no lies
And let us look upon that sign
With eyes, with eyes, with eyes
And tell me how you wear that crown
Of right, of right, of right
You lift us up then let us down
We die, we die, we die
We die, we die, we die1Embed
