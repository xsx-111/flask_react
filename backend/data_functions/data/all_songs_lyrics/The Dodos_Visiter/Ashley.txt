Ashley LyricsTake my hand and lead me out
To Dolores
And leave me out in the street, I guess
It was for us
What are you thinking of, Ashley?
Who are you dreaming of, Ashley?
You come down from above, Ashley
You let me sleep and let me breathe
Where I need to
And fool my heart to think that I
Might have had you
What are you thinking of, Ashley?
Who are you dreaming of, Ashley?
You come down from above, Ashley
Take this hammer-handed heart
And pull it off my back
Heavy on my shoulders
Stranded in the open sea
I wait there hoping that
You'll come back to see me
