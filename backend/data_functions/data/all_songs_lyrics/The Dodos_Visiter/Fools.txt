Fools Lyrics
Our fathers have been entangled in things
He's been squandering, he's been squandering
And we don't do a thing, 'cause we're busy and think
We're just wandering, we're just a-wandering like

Fools, fools, fools
Fools, fools, fools
Fools, fools, fools
Fools, fools, fools

His son is his prize, he tells a few lies
He's got his father's eyes, it's in his father's eyes
And he thinks in his mind that he's just getting by
But he's a compromise, he's just a compromising

Fool, fool, fool
Fool, fool, fool
Fool, fool, fool
Fool, fool, fool

And the stance that we take isn't much to bear
Yeah, we leave things to change on their time
And our failure to care for it leaves us blind
'Til we're tired and we're crazed in the mind
Now he lies on his back, and they tell him it's that
It's just a heart attack, it's just a heart attack
Too late to return to the ones that you've earned
No they don't give it back, no they don't give it back to

Fools, fools, fools
Fools, fools, fools
Fools, fools, fools
Fools, fools, fools

And the stance that we take isn't much to bear
Yeah, we leave things to change on their time
And our failure to care for it leaves us blind
'Til we're tired and we're crazed in the mind

I've been, I've been silent
I've been, I've been silent
I've been, I've been silent
I've been, I've been silent
I've been, I've been silent
I've been, I've been silent
I've been, I've been silent
I've been, I've been silent2Embed
