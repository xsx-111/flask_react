Cabo Wabo LyricsI've been to Rome, Dallas, Texas
Man, I thought I'd seen it all
Around the world, searchin' every corner
Man, I thought I'd hit the wall
There's a sleepy town
South of the Border
If you go there once, you'll be there twice
Lots of pretty girls
Coming by the dozens
The white sand sure makes a tan look nice
We can crash on the beach
You know I wanna make love in the sea
We gotta try a little dance, so Cabo Wabo
It's alright by me
Come on
Let me take you down
I will show you around
Let me take you down
Face down in Cabo
Kissing the ground
Land's end, you'd have to see it
Ain't no picture ever say it right
Walkin' the streets doing that ole, the Cabo Wabo
Place comes to life every night
I wanna crash on the beach
You know I wanna make love in the sea
It's all right there
We don't have to chase it
Fits paradise to a T
Come on
Let me take you down
I will show you around
Let me take you down
Face down in Cabo
Kissing the ground
We drink Mescal right from the bottle
Salt shaker, little lick a lime, ohhh
Throwin' down, down tryin' to reach the bottom
Where the agave worm, well he's mine all mine
Come on
Crash on the beach
You know I wanna make love in the sea
Go try a little dance, so Cabo Wabo
It's alright by me
Let me take you down
I will show you around
Let me take you down
Face down in Cabo
Kissing the ground
Face down
Down in Cabo
Take me down
Down to Cabo
Face down
Down in Cabo
Doin' the Cabo Wabo
Take me down
Down to Cabo
Come on, get it, get itEmbed
