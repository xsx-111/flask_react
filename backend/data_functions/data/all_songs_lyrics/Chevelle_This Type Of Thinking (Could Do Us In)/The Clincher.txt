The Clincher Lyrics
Touch!

I'll stand for nothing less
Or never stand again
These are the limits when one's buried
This body's left the soul

Could we have known?
Never would I, helped to nail down

Careful of drifting off
Now losing taste and touch
Turning a pale blue, leaning in to say
This body's left the soul
The brain needs oxygen
Can't sneak around this bait
His catacomb has got me by the chin
This body's left the soul

Could we have known?
Never would I, helped to nail down
With nothing to gain
Here's the clincher, this should be you
Now saturate, now saturate
Now saturate, now saturate and touch!
Now saturate! Now saturate!
Now saturate, the earth!
Now saturate, now saturate
Now saturate, the earth!!

Well could we have known?
Never would I, helped to nail down
(I'll stand for nothing less)
With nothing to gain, here's the clincher
This should be you, made cold and crippled
This happened to be, never changing
Holding inside (or never stand again)
The phobia viewed, made cold and crippled
Ending it all

Now saturate! Now saturate!
Now saturate! Now saturate! The earth!
Now saturate, now saturate
Now saturate1Embed
