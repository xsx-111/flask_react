To Return Lyrics
To return to the cold
It isn't much fun
To touch the trees no one has known
Go rest your head, 'cause you can't miss this

Poor boy became a slave to use

Now despair moves in so close
Too many years, free at last
He didn't know, so learned to speak
He clears his throat, 'cause you can't miss this

Poor boy became a slave to use
Rebuild what's left of this child, so weak

Sorry, changes trample the plan
Death stores victims, once more
Keep on burnin' through the noose
Keep on burnin' through the noose
Keep on burnin' through the noose
Keep on burnin' through the noose
Keep on
Poor boy became a slave to use
Rebuild what's left of this child, so weak

To return, to the cold
It isn't much, but I'm free at lastEmbed
