Tug-O-War Lyrics
Feed the cut and get in line
To live and burn is tug-o-war
Raped
Go back and forth until it's learned
To suffer now or nothing's gained
Then wake within a freezing sweat
Push and pull, collecting doubt, starting seeds

Lost inspiration, panic on the rise
A severed attempt ignored

The reason never outweighs the truth
So backing up and lean against
The liars club cometh shame
Wasting farther collecting doubt
Starting seeds

Lost inspiration, panic on the rise
A severed attempt ignored

So hand it off, don't care enough
Cause ignorance, is in blissful reach
Lost inspiration, panic on the rise
A severed attempt ignored
Lost inspiration, never played the game
A severed attempt ignored
Feed, the last head tripEmbed
