Still Running Lyrics
Disclaimer: We should all have hope and look towards the day where a man realizes the sounds exiting his mouth are mostly complaints that a change occurs!
Say it, say it
Say it, say it

Alone, you support, and embrace
Another reason to see
Success, we unfold, clutching firm
Betting he panics for sure

Say it, say it, that it's done
I want it, want it, need it done
Say it, say it, that it's done
I want it, want it, need it done

The lie, want to know, has it met
Expectations so far?

Say it, say it, that it's done
I want it, want it, need it done
Say it, say it, that it's done
I want it, want it, need it done
Still running!
Never waking up to say it
Still running!
Never waking up to say it
Still running!
Never waking up to say it
Selfishly walking through killing the angles
Picking and choosing to screw all of them one by one!

So run, make amends, feeling torn
Boy you better be sure! Sure!

Still running!
Never waking up to say it
Still running!
Never waking up to say it
Still running!
Never waking up to say it
Still running! Still running!
Still running! Still running

Say it, say it, that it's done
I want it, want it, need it done
Say it, say it, that it's done
I want it, want it, need it doneEmbed
