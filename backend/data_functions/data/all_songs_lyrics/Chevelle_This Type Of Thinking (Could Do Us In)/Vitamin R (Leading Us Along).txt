Vitamin R (Leading Us Along) Lyrics
Some will learn, many do
Cover up or spread it out
Turn around, had enough
Pick and choose or pass it on
Buying in, heading for
Suffer now or suffer then
It's bad enough I want the fear
Need the fear, 'cause he's alone

(And he has become)
He's alone
(And he has become)

Well if they're making it (making it)
Then they're pushing it (pushing it)
And they're leading us along
The hassle of (hassle of)
All the screaming fits (screaming fits)
That panic makes remorse

After all what's the point
'Cause levitation is possible
If you're a fly, achieved and gone
There's time for this and so much more
It's typical, create a world
A special place of my design
To never cope, or never care
Just use the key, 'cause he's alone

(And he has become)
He's alone
(And he has become)

Well if they're making it (making it)
Then they're pushing it (pushing it)
And they're leading us along
The hassle of (hassle of)
All the screaming fits (screaming fits)
That panic makes remorse

Over and over a slave
Became over and over a slave
Became over! And over! A slave
Became over! And over! A slave

Well if they're making it (making it)
Then you're pushing it (pushing it)
And you're leading us along
The hassle of (hassle of)
All the screaming fits (screaming fits)
That panic held before
Well if they're making it (making it)
Then you're pushing it (pushing it)
And you're leading us along
Like a cancer caused (cancer caused)
All the screaming fits (screaming fits)
And their panic makes remorse8Embed
