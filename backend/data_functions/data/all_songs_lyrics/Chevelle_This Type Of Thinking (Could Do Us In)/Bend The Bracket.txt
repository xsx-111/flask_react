Bend The Bracket Lyrics
So the water's thickening, his collar's pulled
Begin to be aware (it's on)
He needs to focus beyond that man
He brings a world of pain, 'cause

The war is on, too weak to move
Call it off, sorry refused

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

So we bend the bracket, shove it down
Anything to make it fit (it's on)
And being foolish won't cover up
Exposing them as fakes, but

The war is on, too weak to move
Call it off, sorry refused

So boredom captured another fool
Shredding him to bits (it's on)
And the more we tense up, avoiding pain
You'll never learn a thing, 'cause
The war is on, too weak to move
Call it off, sorry refusedEmbed
