Emotional Drought Lyrics
It's possible that the worst of the inside
Could take our pencils away, end creating
Can't let the teachers lay waste of a new mind
Prevent emotional drought and watch the pace quicken

Try to never touch, try to never touch
Won't keep holding back my conscience, realize
There's a choice to not end up like you
Not end up like you, not end up like you

Let's turn our wretched debates into action
By diplomacy gain back a handshake
Tied and unable to tend to the wounds that were made
So much closer to shame, we see but never touch

Try to never touch, try to never touch
Won't keep holding back my conscience, realize
There's a choice to not end up like you
Not end up like you
Search for truth
One more man, tearing at the throat of
One more man, never dropped as fast as
One more man, coloring the fate of
One more man, is better than the fate of you

Try to never touch, try to never touch
Won't keep holding back my conscience, realize
There's a choice to not end up like you
Not end up like you, not end up like youEmbed
