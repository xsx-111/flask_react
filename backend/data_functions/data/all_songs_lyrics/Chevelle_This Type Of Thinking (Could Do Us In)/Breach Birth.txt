Breach Birth Lyrics
Be brave, reshape
Can't force all into molds
Passing out schematics
Forcing all into molds

Once more about to change
Some try and fall beneath molds
Well it's your right so I'll keep on this path
(Turning around bending the shapes, cutting it in)
We could excel beyond the latter fools
(Start a new tone, hating the same, empty the room)

So create, reclaim
Sovereign shapes tempting us
Ration out, their schematics
Dare we live without molds

So far what's left between
They tried and fail beneath molds
Well it's your right so I'll keep on this path
(Turning around bending the shapes, cutting it in)
We could excel beyond the latter fools
(Start a new tone, hating the same, empty the room)
Feel locked in a room
And starting to choke
Enticing the shame
Awaken a world

Well it's your right so I'll keep on this path
(Turning around bending the shapes, cutting it in)
We could excel beyond the latter fools
(Start a new tone, hating the same, empty the room)

So be brave, reshape, create, reclaim
So be brave, reshape, create, reclaimEmbed
