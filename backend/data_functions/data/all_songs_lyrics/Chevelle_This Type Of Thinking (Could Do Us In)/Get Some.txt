Get Some Lyrics
I tried an idea for no reason
Keep the sun off my shoulders, crawling back to

A black out
Touching new life
Face down
Set the pace again
Set the pace again

The drive, the idea still existing
Sat and shuddered, broke the pattern, falling inward
In and down, up and out, let it go, fall away back
Call it off, any day, anyway, make you feel this

A black out
Touching new life
Face down
Set the pace again

Don't take the fall, we'd hate to see
That's entertainment, get some
Eyes on the goal, last one to get
Is passed over, looked over
Never rehearse, they've spiked the water
It's in the blood, get some
We've underestimated
How can I, get some
How can I, how can I, how can I, get some
How can I, how can I, how can I, get some

A Black out
Touching new life
Face down
Set the pace again

A blackout, could this be the one?
A blackout, could this be the one?
A blackout, could this be the one?
A blackout, could this be the one?Embed
