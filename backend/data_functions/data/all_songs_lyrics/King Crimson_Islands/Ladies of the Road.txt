Ladies of the Road Lyrics
A flower lady's daughter
As sweet as holy water
Said: "I'm a school reporter
Please teach me," mmm, I taught her

Two-fingered Levi'd sister
Said, "Peace," I stopped I kissed her
Said, "I'm a male resister,"
I smiled and just unzipped her

High-diving Chinese trender
Black hair and black suspender
Said, "Please, me no surrender
Just love to feel your Fender."

All of you know that the girls of the road
Are like apples we stole in our youth
All of you know that the girls of the road
Been around and are versed in the truth

Stone-headed Frisco spacer
Ate all the meat I gave her
Said would I like to taste hers
And even crave the flavour
Like marron-glac√©ed fish bones
"Oh lady hit the road!"
All of you know that the girls of the road
Are like apples we stole in our youth
All of you know that the girls of the road
Been around and are versed in the truth

Ladies of the road
Ladies of the road
Ladies of the road
Ladies of the road1Embed
