Formentera Lady LyricsHouses iced in whitewash guard a pale shore-line
Cornered by the cactus and the pine
Here I wander where sweet sage and strange herbs grow
Down a crumpled sun-baked stony road
Dusty wheels leaning, rusting in the sun
Snuff brown walls where Spanish lizards run
Here I'm shadowed by a dragon fig tree's fan
Ringed by ants and musing over man
I'll unwind my old strings while the sun shine down
Won't climb any high thing while the sun shine
Formentera Lady, sing your song for me
Formentera Lady, sun lover
Lamplight glows on old guitars the travelers strum
Incense children dance to an Indian drum
Here Odysseus charmed for dark Circe fell
Still her perfume lingers, still her spell
Time's grey hand won't catch me while the stars shine down
Untie and unlatch me while the stars shine
Formentera Lady, dance your dance for me
Formentera Lady, dark lover2Embed
