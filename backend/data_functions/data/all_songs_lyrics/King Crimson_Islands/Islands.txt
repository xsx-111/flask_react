Islands Lyrics
Earth, stream and tree, encircled by sea
Waves sweep the sand from my island
My sunsets fade, field and glade
Wait only for rain, grain after grain
Love erodes my high weathered walls
Which fend off the tide
Cradle the wind to my island

Gaunt granite climbs where gulls wheel and glide
Mournfully cry o'er my island
My dawn bride's veil damp and pale
Dissolves in the sun, love's web is spun
Cats prowl, mice run
Wreathe snatch-hand briars where owls know my eyes
Violet skies touch my island, touch me

Beneath the wind turned wave
Infinite peace
Islands join hands
'Neathe heaven's sea

Beneath the wind turned wave
Infinite peace
Islands join hands
'Neathe heaven's sea

Dark harbour quays like fingers of stone
Hungrily reach from my island
Clutch sailor's words, pearls and gourds
Are strewn on my shore
Equal in love bound in circles
Earth, stream and tree return to the sea
Waves sweep the sand from my island, from me

Beneath the wind turned wave
Infinite peace
Islands join hands
'Neathe heaven's sea


It has a number of high spots - I enjoyed it this time
What are we going to do, do it twice more
Once with the oboe, once without it
And then, we've finished for the evening
Right
