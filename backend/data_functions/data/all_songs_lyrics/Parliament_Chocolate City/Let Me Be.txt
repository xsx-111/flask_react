Let Me Be LyricsMmm, hmm, mmm hmm hmm
Let me be, mmm, hmm
Let me be
Let me have my privacy
Let me be, mmm hmm
Hush, don't speak
Now, silently
I don't want to hear your voice
I don't want to see your face
I don't want to have no choice
In my mind, I want no haze
In a chair
In a chair
In a chair by the window
Let the sky be my sky
Let the moon be my halo
Let me love you upon a canopy
Let me love you upon a flower
Let me love you upon a canopy
Let me love you by the hour
Let me be, ooh-hoo-hoo
Let me be
Let me have my privacy
Let me be, hoo-hoo-hoo-hooo
Hush, don't speak
Now silently
I don't want to hear your voice
I don't want to see your face
I don't want to have no choice
In my mind, we want no haze
In a chair
Looorrrrd, in a chair
In a chair by the window
Let the sky be my sky
Let the moon be my halo
Let me love you upon a canopy
Let me love you on a flower
Let me love you upon a canopy
Let me love you by the hour
Let me be
Said I do not care
Where I am
Please don't let the people find me
I don't want to be there
All I need, all I need, all I neeeed
Is some air, yeah
Oh, yeah, hey, hoo, yeah, ohh, ohh
Zip-dip-dee-dib-a-dooo
Yeah, ohh, yeahh
Let me let
Oh, yeahhh, oh! yeah!!
Hey, see me by that ol'
Dirty funky window, no
Watching on people peepin' on me, lord
Got to get away
Said I've got to get some place
Where I can be free right now
I got to be free
OhhEmbed
