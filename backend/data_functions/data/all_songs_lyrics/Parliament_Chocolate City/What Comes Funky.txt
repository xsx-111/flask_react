What Comes Funky LyricsDoin', what comes funky (x4)
People, what ya gonna do
I can't help you run from you
Don't you know you're in this too
Oh, you do me and I'll do you
There's a brother doing the hickybear???
There's a sexy little sister doing the lump
Oh, swinging like a pendulum
Flashing, I mean flashing, like a strobe
I don't need approval
Oh, to be a mover
Doin', what comes funky (x4)
Ego tripping can be lots of fun
Especially when you're tripping with the one
Music so good I feel outrageous
You can tell by my stroke I'm getting serious
There's a brother doing the hickybear???
There's a sexy little sister doing the lump
Oh, swinging like a pendulum
Flashing, I mean flashing, like a strobe
Joys don't need no alibi
Embarassment will never live you down
Save your foolishness for another day
But for tonight, come out and play
There's a brother doing the hickybear???
There's a sexy little sister doing the lump
Oh, swinging like a pendulum
Flashing, I mean flashing, like a strobe
Oh!Embed
