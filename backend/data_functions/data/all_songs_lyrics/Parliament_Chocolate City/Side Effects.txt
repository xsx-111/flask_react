Side Effects LyricsCatch me duckin' in and out
But never lettin' her know that I found out
Lurkin' here, creepin' there
People giving me those funny stares
Makes time, bitter on occasion
Her side effects are really amazing
Mouth shake, funny lies
Love to talk such phony jive
Oh, the side effect
Of the love she put on me (Oh, it's incorrect)
Cause it's taken the love out of me
The side effect
She's lovin' me like she said she would
Oh, it's disrespect
She's robbin' me of my manhood
The side effect
In a love that's ?
Should have been a dude the way she's playin'
Girl's got a hold on me
I can't disconnect
And I never want to break free
How can a love feel so good
Oww, and at the same time, make me ill
She's like a miracle drug that makes you feel better
And at the same time she's a no-good pill
The side effect
Like the fun that we've got goin'
Oh, it's incorrect
Seems to me I'm floatin'
The side effect
Oh, this thing that's got me reelin'
Shows me disrespect
And she's got no real feelin'
The side effect
In a love there's lots of pain
She should have been a dude the way she's playin'
The side effect
I can't disconnect
I never want to break free
How can can a love be so good
Oh, but at the same time make you ill
She was the miracle drug that made me feel better
But at the same time she's a no-good pill
The side effect
Of the love you put on me
Is incorrect
Cause it's taken the love outta me
The side effect
Lovin' me like she said she would
Oh it's disrespect
Robbing me of my manhood
The side effect
In a love there's ???
Should've been a dude the way she's playing
The side effects
I can't disconnect
The side effect
Oh, is incorrectEmbed
