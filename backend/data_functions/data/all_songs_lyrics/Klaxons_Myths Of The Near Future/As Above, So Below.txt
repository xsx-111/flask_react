As Above, So Below Lyrics
Sailing silver waves, through the skies and 'round your eyes
And in the pockets of the tide, a meeting place by night
Sequin covered swans that are used to make their own mosaics
A ceremony comes: An exponential fate

The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows
As above, so below

A whippoorwhill in flight turns east towards westphalia
In search of lost time, with the magic of true light
Tone zodiac in tune, with the fossil of our themepark
And falling from the seams, is a steeple swarmed in light

The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows
As above, so below
The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows
As above, so below
Galloping, galloping beams faster
Galloping, galloping beams faster
Galloping, galloping beams faster
Joining together and still faster
Joining together and still faster
Joining together and still faster
Joining together and still faster
Onwards past never and still faster
Onwards past never and still faster
Always past never and still faster 

The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows
As above, so below
The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows
As above, so belowEmbed
