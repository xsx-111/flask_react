Hall of Records LyricsA maples move
A murder on the moon shine
Modus operandi
A beak on blue
A bounty on Bermuda
Horse in the night breaks serpent's sea
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Every time we leave
Come on and dance with me
Every night we leave
Come on and dance with me
Our games end in endless harmony
Our games end in endless harmony
A devils beat
A deadline on decorum
Modus operandi
A roder red
A rumble in Rotunda
My souls their signs infrequency
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Every time we leave
Come on and dance with me
Every night we leave
Come on and dance with me
Our games end in endless harmony
Our games end in endless harmony
Come on and dance with me (x15)Embed
