Isle of Her LyricsRow, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll reach the isle of her
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll find the peacock's tail
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll steal the mother of pearl
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll eat the dancing girls
(Row) Cyclops gazing alone
(Row) Facing mirrors that show
(Row) The reflection, his own
(Row) Face to face
A hand on each of the oars
A hand on each of the oars
We're seven miles from shore
Just keep on going
A hand on each of the oars
A hand on each of the oars
We're seven miles from shore
Just keep on going
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll sail across dry lands
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll cut the grassy knoll
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll steal a single jewel
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll light the crystal sword
A hand on each of the oars
A hand on each of the oars
We're seven miles from shore
Just keep on going
A hand on each of the oars
A hand on each of the oars
We're seven miles from shore
Just keep on going
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll reach the isle of her
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll find the peacock's tail
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll steal the mother of pearl
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
We'll eat the dancing girls
(Row) Cyclops gazing alone
(Row) Facing mirrors that show
(Row) The reflection, his own
(Row) Face to face
(Row) Cyclops gazing alone
Face to face
Face to face
Face to face
Face to face
Face to face
Face to face
