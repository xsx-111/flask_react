Totem on the Timeline LyricsAt Club 18-30 I met Julius Caesar
Lady Diana and Mother Teresa
At Club 18-30 I met Julius Caesar
Lady Diana and Mother Teresa
Signs, you know I see them all the time
Time; it's just a fraction of a sign
Cerebella sitting on the totem timeline
Unwelcome foreign hands are very hard to find
And hangman also die
In Famagusta's hive
Cerebella sitting on the totem timeline
Unwelcome foreign hands are very hard to find
And hangman also die
In Famagusta's hive
At Club 18-30 I met Julius Caesar
Lady Diana and Mother Teresa
At Club 18-30 I met Julius Caesar
Lady Diana and Mother Teresa
Signs, you know I see them all the time
Time; it's just a fraction of a sign
Cerebella sitting on the totem timeline
Unwelcome foreign hands are very hard to find
And hangman also die
In Famagusta's hive
Cerebella sitting on the totem timeline
Unwelcome foreign hands are very hard to find
And hangman also die
In Famagusta's hive
Cerebella sitting on the totem timeline
Unwelcome foreign hands are very hard to find
And hangman also die
In Famagusta's hive
Cerebella sitting on the totem timeline
Unwelcome foreign hands are very hard to find
And hangman also die
In Famagusta's hiveEmbed
