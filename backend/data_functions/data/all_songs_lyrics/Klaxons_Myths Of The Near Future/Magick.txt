Magick LyricsMagick without tears
Magick without tears
Magick without tears
We're magickal veneer
The way to mother noose
The way to suck an egg
The way to Golden Dawn
The way to Koh Phangan
The glitter on the snow
The place to always go
Do what you will
Do what you will
The glitter on the snow
The place to always go
Do what you will
Do what you will
Magick without tears
Magick without tears
Magick without tears
We're magickal veneer
The way to mother noose
The way to suck an egg
The way to Golden Dawn
The way to Koh Phangan
The glitter on the snow
The place to always go
Do what you will
Do what you will
The glitter on the snow
The place to always go
Do what you will
Do what you will
The vision and the voice
The view from devils town
The snake with tail on tongue
The broken silver one
The glitter on the snow
The place to always go
Do what you will
Do what you will
Magick without tears
Magick without tears
Magick without tears
We're magickal veneer1Embed
