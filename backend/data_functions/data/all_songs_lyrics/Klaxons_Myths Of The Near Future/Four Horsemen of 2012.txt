Four Horsemen of 2012 Lyrics(coughing and bubble sounds)
There's a half-man, half-horse, that still pollutes my thoughts as he rides on a flame in the sky
He calls through the centuries with me on his entries
The kids and the cats watch him fly
Please catch that half-horse as he murders my thoughts, with fragments of flames anyway
Half-man, half-horse that still pollutes my thoughts as he rides on a flame in the sky
Four horsemen, 2012
Klaxons not centaurs! (ooow)
There's a half-man, half-horse, that still pollutes my thoughts as he rides on a flame in the sky
He calls through the centuries with me on his entries
The kids and the cats watch him fly
Please catch that half-horse as he murders my thoughts, with fragments of flames anyway
Half-man, half-horse that still pollutes my thoughts as he rides on a flame in the sky
Four horsemen, 2012
Klaxons not centaurs! (ooow)Embed
