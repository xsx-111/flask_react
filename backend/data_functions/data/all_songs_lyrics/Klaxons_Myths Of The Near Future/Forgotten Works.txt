Forgotten Works LyricsThe tomb crew bring sugar oil
We’ll meet at the mirrored statue
Margaret, my girl, standing on air
That is my name, that is my name
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something’s going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something’s going to happen
The tomb crew bring sugar oil
We’ll meet at the mirrored statue
Margaret, my girl, standing on air
That is my name, that is my name
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something’s going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something’s going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something’s going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something’s going to happen

(Tigers, inBOIL)
(Forgotten works)
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something’s going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something’s going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something’s going to happen
Light the bridges with the lantern
You know something’s going to happenEmbed
