Two Receivers LyricsKrill-Edible oceans at their feet
A troublesome troupe out on safari
A lullaby holds their drones in sleep
For tattering clearly indiscreet
Five fallible flags in hypersonic
Are told to stay nearly out of reach
And in space two receivers turn away
Just in case two receivers turn away
To displace two receivers turn away
And in space
Submissions in outer regions pleased
A gathering of teens in Old Sargasso
Whose aim is to fall flat at their feet
While sat on a sparsely crowded beach
Marine noticed change in perfect timing
A widow to all but her pastiche
And in space two receivers turn away
Just in case two receivers turn away
To displace two receivers turn away
And in space
Eternal flow strings to your bow
Roam through the globe
Eternal flow strings to your bow
Roam through the globe
Krill-Edible oceans at their feet
(Eternal flow)
A troublesome troupe out on safari
(Strings to your bow)
A lullaby holds their drones in sleep
(Roam through the globe)
And in space
Krill-Edible oceans at their feet
(Eternal flow)
Two receivers turn away
A troublesome troupe out on safari
(Strings to your bow)
Just in case two receivers turn away
A lullaby holds their drones in sleep
(Roam through the globe)
To displace
Krill-Edible oceans at their feet
(Eternal flow)
Two receivers turn away
A troublesome troupe out on safari
(Strings to your bow)
And in space
A lullaby holds their drones in sleep
(Roam through the globe)Embed
