Atlantis to Interzone Lyrics
DJ

Good thieves of burning cars
Encircle poisoned rivers, minds and hearts
Horses wanna dance
But find their wings are damaged, water damaged
Gold is selling now
So hurry, mighty ocean rising fast
A big man with a plan
Has got a storm a-coming, monster coming

(Check this)
From Atlantis to Interzone
You start at the edge
And you end on your own
From Atlantis to Interzone (Atlantis — Interzone)
You start at the edge (Atlantis — Interzone)
And you end on the throne

(DJ)
We’re fragments of fiction
You’re dead man half alive
Who hangs from helping numbers 1, 2, 5
His ears pricked with a knife
Hears that the east are coming, west are coming
Gravity’s rainbow
The axis here is still unknown
Children’s faces glow
The wasteland guides them, wasteland guides them

From Atlantis to Interzone
You start at the edge
And you end on your own
From Atlantis to Interzone (Atlantis — Interzone)
You start at the edge (Atlantis — Interzone)
And you end on the throne
From Atlantis to Interzone (Atlantis — Interzone)
You start at the edge (Atlantis — Interzone)
And you end on your own
