Golden Skans Lyrics
Light touch my hands, in a dream of Golden Skans, from now on
You can forget our future plans
Night touch my hands with the turning Golden Skans
From the night to the light, all plans are golden in your hands

Set sail from sense, bring all her young
Set sail from where we once begun
While we wait, while we wait

A hall of records, or numbers, or spaces still undone
Ruins, or relics, disciples, and the young
A hall of records, or numbers, or spaces still undone
Ruins, or relics, disciples, and the young

Light touch my hands, in a dream of Golden Skans, from now on
You can forget our future plans
Night touch my hands with the turning Golden Skans
From the night to the light, all plans are golden in your hands

We sailed from sense, brought all her young
We sailed from where we once begun
While we wait, while we wait
A hall of records, or numbers, or spaces still undone
Ruins, or relics, disciples, and the young
A hall of records, or numbers, or spaces still undone
Ruins, or relics, disciples, and the young

Light touch my hands, in a dream of Golden Skans, from now on
You can forget our future plans
Night touch my hands with the turning Golden Skans
From the night to the light, all plans are golden in your hands
Light touch my hands, in a dream of Golden Skans, from now on
You can forget our future plans
Night touch my hands with the turning Golden Skans
From the night to the light, all plans are golden in your hands4Embed
