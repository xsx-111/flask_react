Shout LyricsLatimer/Hoover
Another day...
I might have found the words to say
All the things i meant to say
All the years that passed between
You never understood the meaning of my way
Another day there might have been
Some other way to make
The sacrifice
Another day...
I would try to be a friend
You would never let me in
If I could have it otherwise
I'd chase the demons from your eyes to ease your soul
But now you've reached this other side
Where hopes and broken dreams can't turn the tide
SHOUT!
To the top
SHOUT!
Through your defenses...
SHOUT!
To the top
SHOUT!
Another day...
You might have found your destiny
Knowing that it's meant to be
A self-effacing prodigy
You gave it up for infamy
And fell from grace
And so I wrote this song for you
The only way I know to wish you peace
SHOUT!
To the top
SHOUT!
Through your pretenses...
SHOUT!
To the top
Lay down your defenses
SHOUT!
To the topEmbed
