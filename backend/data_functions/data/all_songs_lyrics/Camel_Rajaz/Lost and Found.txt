Lost and Found LyricsLatimer/Hoover
Where have you come from
Where have you been?
How can you know
Unless you begin?
Turn around
Giving more than you take
Lost and found
In the past
The chance of a lifetime
Is passing you by
Use it or lose it
In the wink of an eye
Turn around
Giving more than you take
Lost and found
In the pastEmbed
