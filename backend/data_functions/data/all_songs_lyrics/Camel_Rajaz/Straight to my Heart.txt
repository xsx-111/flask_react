Straight to my Heart LyricsI was born in '49
Family of four
Father had his own band
Was just after the war
My brother and I had a radio
And every night we'd share
Waves from Luxembourg
Came though the air
Days were full of music
And nights were just the same
And though the songs are different now
Some things never change...
Can't explain the way I feel
Why, event to this day
I still love the sound of that red guitar
It takes my breath away
And goes straight...
To my heart
Straight to my heart
Straight to my heartEmbed
