Lawrence LyricsAll across this barren land
Elder voices tell
Stories of a desert ghost
The legend of a man
Swallowed by the sand
High upon the red dunes
A prophet in the wind...
A vision like a mirage
Rises from a man
Swallowed by the sand
Fading...
Into the shadows
Of the legend
You became
Fading...
Into the mystery
And the romance
Of your fame1Embed
