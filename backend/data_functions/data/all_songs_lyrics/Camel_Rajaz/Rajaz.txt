Rajaz LyricsLatimer/Hoover
When the desert sun has passed horizon's final light
And darkness takes it's place...
We will pause to take our rest
Sharing songs of love
Tales of tragedy
The souls of heaven
Are stars at night
They will guide us on our way
Until we meet again
Another day
When a poet sings the song and all are hypnotised
Enchanted by the sound...
We will mark the time as one
Tandem in the sun
The rhythm of a hymn
The souls of heaven
Are stars at night
They will guide us on our way
Until we meet again
Another day
When the dawn has come
Sing the song
All day long
We will move as one
Bear the load
On the road
The souls of heaven
Turn to stars
Every single night
All across the sky...
They shine6Embed
