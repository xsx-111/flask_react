Daylight Lyrics
To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight

Ooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Oooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Ooh, come apart without it

On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
And at full tilt
And in full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight

Ooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Oooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Ooh, come apart without
Daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight6Embed
