A Whisper Lyrics
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face, who remembers you when you are gone?
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forwards or backwards?
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face, who remembers you when you are gone?
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah4Embed
