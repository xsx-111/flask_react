Clocks Lyrics
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead
Singin', come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and tickin' clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin', come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, where I wanted to go

Home, where I wanted to go
Home (You are)
Home, where I wanted to go
Home (You are)
Home, where I wanted to go79Embed
