God Put a Smile Upon Your Face Lyrics
Where do we go? Nobody knows
I've got to say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line?
I've got to say I wasted all your time, oh, honey, honey
Where do I go to fall from grace
God put a smile upon your face, yeah

And ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face, oh yeah

And ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
Na, na-na, na-na, num-ma-na, na-na
As good as mine
As good as mine (As good as mine)
As good as mine (As good as mine)
As good as mine (As good as mine)

Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face17Embed
