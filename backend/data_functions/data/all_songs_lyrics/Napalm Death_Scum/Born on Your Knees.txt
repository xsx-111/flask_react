Born on Your Knees LyricsBorn on your knees
Life in chains
A slow death
Into your graves
Born on your knees
Born on your knees
Life of pain
Existence restricted
By material gains
Born on your knees
You fucking asshole
Born on your knees
Conditioned blind
Crawling to death
Revenge for your crime
Born on your knees
Born on your knees
From the womb torn
Live in chains
And die as you were born
Born on your kneesEmbed
