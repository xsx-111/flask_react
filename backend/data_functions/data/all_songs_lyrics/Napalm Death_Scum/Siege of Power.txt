Siege of Power Lyrics

Siege of power
In your land
Too many problems
For you to understand
Siege of power
Inside your mind
Outward restrictions
To keep you in line

Siege of power - in your land
Too many problems - for you to understand
A slave of their power - you never question why
You're going to suffer - you're going to die
Siege of power - inside your mind
Outward restrictions - to keep you in line
You're a slave of their power - you never questioned why
You were made to suffer - you were born to die

Siege of power
They made you a tool
While others were ruling
You were being ruledEmbed
