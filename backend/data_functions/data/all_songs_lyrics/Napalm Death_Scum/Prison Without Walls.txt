Prison Without Walls LyricsTrapped
Inside your head
Insular, living dead
Existing for a purpose you'll never find
Inducements, distortions contorting your mind
External sources maintain control
Programmed existance, fulfill your role
You've got a brain, shake off the reigns
Smash the shackles, break the chainsEmbed
