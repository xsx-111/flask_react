Point of No Return LyricsSystematic rape of nature
Profit precedes need
Maintaining economic stature
Steal the fruit yet leave no seed
And of future generations?
What of their inheritance
A world of contamination
Poisoned by our ignorance
Oblivious to reality
Conscience spurned
Beyond the point of no return1Embed
