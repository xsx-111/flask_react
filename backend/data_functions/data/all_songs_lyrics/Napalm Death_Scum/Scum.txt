Scum Lyrics
In your mind
Nothing but fear
You can't face life
Or believe death's near
A vision of life
On television screens
An existence created
From empty dreams

Hide behind T.V
Hide behind life
You should be living
But you only survive
Life holds nothing
But pain and death
Don't look for love
There is none leftEmbed
