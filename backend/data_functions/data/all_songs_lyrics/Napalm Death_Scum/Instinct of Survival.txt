Instinct of Survival Lyrics
Advertise the product you make
Never give but always take
Kill and lie for security
Your shit on supermarket shelves to see
Instinct of survival

The multinational corporations
Makes its profit from the starving nations
Indigenous peoples become their slaves
From their births into their graves
The multinational corporations
Makes its profit from the starving nations
Another product for you to buy
You'll keep paying until you dieEmbed
