Astounded Lyrics
All I want to do is love you
I just want to take you there

Baby, I don't want to argue
Don't even want to fight
I just want to love you
And hold you all the night
The message from the party
Nothing to do with how...
Try to keep it happy
Then depress yourself to cry
All I want to do is love you
You've got to move on up
You've got to move on up

All I want to do is love you
(Oh oh oh, hey, hey, hey)
I just want to take you there

The world is trying to make us
Go against our will
There's too many mountains
Grown up from a hill
Just take nothing less
Than the second best
Do not obey
What most people say
Cause you can pass the test
All I want to do is love you
Baby, we've got to move on up
We've got to move on up
All I want to do is love you
(Oh oh oh)
I just want to take you there
All I want to do is love you
(Hey, hey, hey)
It feels like I'm already there
(Laughs)

The world is trying to make us
Go against our will
It's early in our language
Of how the human feels
I just want to love you
I just want to cry
I just want to love you
I just want
I just want
I just want to love you
I just want to cry
I just want to love you
All I want to do is love you
It feels like I'm already there
