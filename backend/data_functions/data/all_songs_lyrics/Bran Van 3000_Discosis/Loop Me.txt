Loop Me Lyrics
Loop me round and round
I will still stand tall though claim knocked down
And if you loop me into sound
I am found

And force me to capsize
By the strength of your intimidation
And factual lies
And If you force me to capsize
You’re denied
I’m astounded by the way you deal
With all your views and the things you conceal
And in view of all you views I think you feel
Yes, in view of all your fearlessness
You’re dying to reveal that
You’ll tell me anything I want to hear
You’ll tell me anything to keep me near

That’s how you loop me round and round
I will still stand tall though claim knocked down
And If you loop me into sound
I am found
I was feeling kind of ugly
Wanted everyone to love me
You can call it kind of greedy
Call it giving to the needy
Though I do believe you’ll tell me what I want to hear
You’ll tell me anything to keep me near

That’s how you loop me
That’s how you groove me
And how you keep me and you lose me
You loop me
And it goes on and on and on...Embed
