Stepchild LyricsShe: Do you ever wish you were somebody else?
He: All the time
She: Why, don't you like yourself?
He: No, it's - it's not that. I mean, it's just not what you thought it would be
I mean, my, uh, my old man he used to sit, and he'd go; "I don't know."
I mean, he'd just be sitting there, and - and, uh, he'd say "I don't know."
And I'd say "What, Daddy? What don't you know?"
And he'd say "I don't know."
He'd have a thought, and he'd go "I don't know. I don't know."
And I guess it's just 'cause you never do figure it out
She: Don't you like yourself?
He: No, it's - it's not that. It's, it's some way you, you fucked up
And somewhere down the line, something went wrong, and, uh
You spend the rest of your life trying to figure it outEmbed
