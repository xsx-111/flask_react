Montreal Lyrics
I think I love to watch you laughing
In fact I love to watch you do anything
And yes I do feel this thing happening
But you'll have to excuse me girl
Cause my taxi's waiting
Although I do

 x2
Yes I do
I love you in my own twisted ways

One day God walked on old mount royal
Just to dream up the human form
Threw stones and cans and comic books in a kettle
And you came out like a shining goddess heavy metal
Say it's just too bad some hearts don't settle
And the pipes are leaking and you feel like leaving
Yeah, we heard this one before
I said, dear god, buddy, now don't you meddle
'cause I've got my own little twisted ways of showing you that I do
 x2
And sing it
Like we used to sing


See kermit the frog was one day daydreaming
Thinking about himself at a red light
With that it-ain't-easy-being-greenin'
And the cars behind him kept honking and honking
And kermit's last words as he flipped the bird
Was, damn you muppets just keep on taking!
See I've got my own things now so stop tooting
I do my lily pad jumping
Miss piggy bumping
Lotta miss piggys and that's all good
And I'm gonna turn this red light
Into a block party
So we can get down in basics of what?
Rainbow connecting
 x2
