Ritchie Sacramento Lyrics
Rise crystal spear, fly true over me
Suddenly gone from here, left alone on the road
What brings you back?
Promises of a memory
Your own ghost running away with the past

Disappear in the sun
All gone, all gone
It took a while just to think
Of home, of home

My oldest friend that I barely knew
So much fun hanging around in the dark
You stop time
Managed to somehow find a way out of here
Dagger in everyone's heart

Disappear in the sun
All gone, all gone
It took a while just to think
Of homе, of home

Disappear in the sun
All gonе, all gone
It took a while just to think
Of home, of home2Embed
