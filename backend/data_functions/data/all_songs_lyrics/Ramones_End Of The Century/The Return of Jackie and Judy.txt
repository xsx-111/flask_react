The Return of Jackie and Judy Lyrics
Jackie is a punk
Judy is a runt
They went down to the Mudd Club
And they both got drunk

Oh yeah
Whoa oh

Jackie is a bookie
Judy's taking loans
They both came up to New York
Just to see the Ramones

Oh yeah
Whoa oh

And oh, I don't know why she wrote that letter
Oh no, oh no
Oh I don't know why
We won't forget her, oh no
Jackie's playing hooky
Judy's playing pool
They both got caught for cutting
Got to go to summer school

Oh yeah
Whoa oh

Jackie's scalping tickets
Judy's getting harassed
They both got kicked outside
Didn't have a backstage pass

Oh yeah
Whoa oh

And oh, I don't why she wrote that letter
Oh no, oh no
Oh, I don't know why

Don't know what's on her mind
I don't know, no, I don't know
But I can't stand to see her crying
She's still crying, she ain't trying
She's going to get left behind
Nobody wants you, nobody wants youEmbed
