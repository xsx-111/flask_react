Danny Says Lyrics
Danny says we gotta go
Gotta go to Idaho
But we can't go surfing
'Cause it's 20 below

Sound check's at 5:02
Record stores and interviews
Oh, but I can't wait
To be with you tomorrow

Baby
Oh, we got nowhere to go
And it may sound funny, but it's true

Hangin' out in 100 B
Watching Get Smart on TV
Thinking about
You and me and you and me

Hanging out in L.A
And there's nowhere to go
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow
Listening to Sheena on the radioEmbed
