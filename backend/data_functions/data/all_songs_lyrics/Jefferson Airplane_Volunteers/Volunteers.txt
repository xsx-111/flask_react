Volunteers LyricsLook what's happening out in the streets
Got a revolution
Got to revolution
Hey I'm dancing down the street
Got a revolution
Got to revolution
Ain't it amazing all the people I meet
Got a revolution
Got to revolution
One generation got old
One generation got soul
This generation got no dissertation to hold
Pick up the cry
Hey now it's time for you and me
Got a revolution
Got to revolution
Come on now we're marching to the sea
Got a revolution
Got to revolution
Who will take it from you
We will and who are we
We are volunteers of America
Volunteers of America
Volunteers of America
Volunteers of America
Volunteers of America
Got a revolution
Got a revolution
Look what's happening out in the streets
Got a revolution
Got to revolution
Hey I'm dancing down the street
Got a revolution
Got to revolution
Ain't it amazing all the people I meet
Got a revolution
We are volunteers of America
Yeah, we're volunteers of America
We're volunteers of America
Volunteers of America
Volunteers of America
