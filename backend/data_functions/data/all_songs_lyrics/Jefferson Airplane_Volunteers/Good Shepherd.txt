Good Shepherd LyricsIf you want to get to heaven
Over on the other shore
Stay out of the way of the blood stained bandit
Oh good shepherd feed my sheep
One for Paul, one for Silas
One for to make my heart rejoice
Can't you hear my lambs a callin
Oh good shepherd feed my sheep
If you want to get to heaven
Over on the other shore
Stay out of the way of the long tongue liar
Oh good shepherd feed my sheep
One for Paul, one for Silas
One for to make my heart rejoice
Can't you hear my lambs a callin
Oh good shepherd feed my sheep
If you want to get to heaven
Over on the other shore
Stay out of the way of the gun shot devil
Oh good shepherd feed my sheep
One for Paul, one for Silas
One for to make my heart rejoice
Can't you hear my lambs a callin
Oh good shepherd feed my sheepEmbed
