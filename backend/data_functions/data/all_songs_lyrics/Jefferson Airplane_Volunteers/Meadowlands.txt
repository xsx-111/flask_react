*Baby cries, chatter*
Come and get it
Dollar fifteen, too
Get your bargins right over here
Dollar fifteen, too
Look at the bargins over here, ladies
Ladies, everybody's entitled to buy
Everybody's entitled for a good buy
Right over here, get it
Please come over here and get it
Dollar fifteen, too
Step inside
Hi, how are you?
*Chatter*
Yes, you'll get it, you'll get it
Wait, I'll give it to you in a minute
Come over here, you'll get it
Right over here
Here, one fifty-two Orchird Street, and one forty-eight Orchird Street
Yes? Yes
I take care of the babies, too
Once a buy, like fifty cents an hour watching the babies..
While you do your shopping right over here
You get it right over here
At Mendel's Department Store
Yes, you entitled for good buy, and you get it
Right over here
Thank you
You get it, right over hereEmbed
