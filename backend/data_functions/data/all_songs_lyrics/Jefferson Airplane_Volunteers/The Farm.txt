The Farm LyricsBought myself a farm way out in the country
Took to growin' lettuce milkin' cows and honey
Bought myself a farm (way out in the country)
Bought myself a farm way out in the country
Spent time in the hayloft with the mice and the bunnies
Spent time in the country
Yes it's good livin' on the farm
Ah so good livin' on the farm
Yes it's good livin' on the farm
Here comes my next door neighbour comin' down the road
He always looks so regal ridin' on his toad named Lightnin'
The toad's name is Lightnin' he's ten hands at the shoulder
And if you give him sugar you know he'll whinny like a boulder
Yes he will
Well I gotta get back to work now and clear away some logs
Ah the sun is shinin' westwards yeah I think I'll saddle up my frog and
Get outta hereEmbed
