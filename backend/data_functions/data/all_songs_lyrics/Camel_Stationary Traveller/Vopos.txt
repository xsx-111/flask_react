Vopos LyricsThey woke you in the night
A glare from bright headlights
Sentry's in a row
You watched them from a front window
Through sleepy eyes you saw the scene
And felt as if a dream...
Had come to life
Caught by surprise
Protection in disguise
A high barricade
The price too high to pay
The late-night dancers filled the street
And stopped as if a dream...
Had come to life
A wail and a cry
Blue lights flashing by
In shadows of the trees
A zone runs in between
The young-boy soldiers filled the streets
And moved as if a dream...
Had come to life
Can it be a nightmare?
Will you wake and still be there?
So you try to run
Frightened you're the one
Left insideEmbed
