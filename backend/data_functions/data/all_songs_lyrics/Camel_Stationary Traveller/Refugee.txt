Refugee LyricsThere's a rumor flying through the air;
Paranoia's creeping everywhere
You're gonna raise a wall
To draw the line
You say you've got your reasons
I hear them all the time
You say it's talking treason
And a crime...
To question why
Don't you know I've seen this all before?
History repeats itself once more
I don't want to go
And I can't stay
You say you've got your reasons
I hear them all the time
You say it's talking treason
And a crime...
To question why
I don't want to be a refugee
I just want a single guarantee
I don't want to be a refugee
I just want the right to disagreeEmbed
