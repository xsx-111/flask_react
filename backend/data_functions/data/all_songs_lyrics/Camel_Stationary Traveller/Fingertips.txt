Fingertips LyricsIn the time it takes to laugh
Love can turn the key
Crystal clear the future lies
And what will be will be
Don't hold it back
Take the chance you missed
Don't hold it back
Fill the emptiness
Soon the time to say farewell
Will come with no return
Older now but wiser from
Lessons we have learned
Don't hold it back
Take the chance you missed
Don't hold it back
Fill the emptiness
Slip through your fingertips
Speak from your heart don't let it
Slip through your fingertips
Search for the feeling in it
Don't let it -
Slip through your fingertips
Lost if you leave too late
All at your fingertips
Gone if you hesitateEmbed
