Cloak and Dagger Man LyricsStepping outside
There's no turning back
Looking behind
There's no turning back
Nowhere to hide—
Watch out for the man in drag;
She's got you tagged!
Checking all around
There's no turning back
Listen for a sound
There's no turning back
Keep your head down—
Watch out for the go-between!
The cloak and dagger man follows
Run undercover and trust in no one you know
Watch what you say
There's no turning back
Lovers will betray!
Watch out for the promise of...
The cloak and dagger man follows
Run undercover and trust in no one you knowEmbed
