West Berlin LyricsFeel a chill in the dark
Twilight falls
Feel the beat of your heart
Danger calls
Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...
Well I'm planning it out
Day by day
There's no room for doubt
Just one way
Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...
And I'm looking out over West Berlin
Feeling freer now than I've ever been
When the sun sets over West Berlin
I'll be leaving, I can't come back again
And I'm looking out over West Berlin
West Berlin
In the flood of the light
Safety will shine
We'll be high out of sight
On steel cable line
Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...
And I'm looking out over West Berlin
Feeling freer now than I've ever been
When the sun sets over West Berlin
I'll be leaving, I can't come back again
And I'm looking out over West Berlin
West BerlinEmbed
