Long Goodbyes LyricsDown by the lake
A warm afternoon -
Breezes carry children's balloons
Once upon a time
Not long ago
She lived in a house by the grove
And she recalls the day
When she left home...
Long good-byes
Make me so sad
I have to leave right now
And though I hate to go
I know it's for the better
Long good-byes
Make me so sad
Forgive my leaving now
You know I'll miss you so
And days we spent together
Long in the day
Moon on the rise -
She sighs with a smile in her eyes
In the park
It's late afterall
She sits and stares at the wall
And she recalls the day
When she left home...
(repeat chorus)Embed
