Everybody Lyrics
Oh, everybody, get down on the floor (Get down on the floor)
I love the way you shake your thing
You make me want some more (Make me want some more)

I've had my days of standing on shaky grounds
I want my life so fancy-free
I know that I can do it
I have to let me be
And I've had enough
And I know what's right for me

I've done my time and I have paid the price
All you have to do
Is state my name out loud
Forget your worries
And let's dance and shout
All you have to do
Is state my name out loud

Oh, everybody, get down on the floor (Get down on the floor)
I love the way you shake your thing
You make me want some more (Make me want some more)
Listen
This time I'm leaving all my cares behind
I've tasted the good life and it's fine
No more to pain and strife, this life's waiting to be
And I've had enough
And I know what's right for me

I've done my time and I have paid the price
All you have to do
Is state my name out loud
Forget your worries
And let's dance and shout
'Cause we're here to live so free
I've got to let me be

Oh, everybody, get down on the floor (Get down on the floor)
I love the way you shake your thing
You make me want some more, babe (Make me want some more)
Oh, everybody, get down on the floor (Get down on the floor)
'Cause I love the way you move, shake your thing
You make me want some more, babe (Make me want some more)

Hey, I've done my time and I have paid the price
All you have to do
Is state my name out loud
Forget your worries
And let's dance and shout
'Cause we're here to live so free
I've got to let me be
Oh, everybody, gon' get down on the floor (Get down on the floor)
I love the way you shake your thing
You make me want some more, babe (Make me want some more)
Oh (Everybody) C'mon get down on the floor (Get down on the floor)
I love the way you move, the way you groove
You make me want some more, babe (Make me want some more)
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down (Get down on the floor)
Get down, get down, get down
Make me want some more, babe (Make me want some more)
Oh, everybody, we're gonna get down on the floor (Get down on the floor)
I love the way you groove, the way you move
Ya' make me want some more (Make me want some more)
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down (Get down on the floor)
Get down, get down, get down
Make me want some more, babe (Make me want some more)
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love the way you move6Embed
