Can You Feel It Lyrics
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

If you look around
The whole world is coming together now
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Feel it in the air, the wind is taking it everywhere
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who's hating his brother, when hate won't do
Cause  we're all the same, yes the blood inside me is inside you now tell me
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it, now tell me
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

Sing out loud
Because we want to make a crowd
Touch a hand and sing a sound so pure, salvation rings
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
All the children of the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Take the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers, when death won't do
Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside me is inside of you, now tell me
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
Every healthy smile
Is hunger and strife to another child
But the stars do shine
In promising salvation, is near this time
Can you feel it now
So brothers and  sisters
Show we know how
Now tell me
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
All the children of the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Take the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers, when death won't do
Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside my veins is inside of you, now tell me
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it4Embed
