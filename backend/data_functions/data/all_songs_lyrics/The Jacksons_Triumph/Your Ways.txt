Your Ways LyricsYou can't say, girl, that I don't love ya
Nights cryin', thinkin' of ya
I don't understand your ways
They say true love is forever gladness
All that I feel is sadness
I don't understand your ways
You keep me walkin' my way back to you
You say you love me then leave me so blue
You break my heart, then you say that we're through
But it's okay
I don't understand your ways
What have I done to deserve this madness?
All that I feel is sadness
I don't understand your ways
You keep me walkin' my way back to you
You say you love me and let's start anew
You break my heart, then say we're through, hey
No more believin'
In every word you say
Persuasions deceiving
But I'm wise in every way
And I know 'bout your playin'
With every guy in town
So this time I'm sayin'
You won't fool me around
Then you get me walkin' my way back to you
You say you love me then leave me so blue
You break my heart, then you say that we're through
But it's okay
You're no good
I don't understand your ways
One more fool just to love and groove ya
That's all that he wanna do to ya
I don't understand your ways3Embed
