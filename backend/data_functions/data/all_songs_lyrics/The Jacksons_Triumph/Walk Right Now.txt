Walk Right Now Lyrics
(Yeah)

Here, when all my work is done
She calls and she says, "Dear, can I come?"
I say to her, that "You know, our love has gone
But aggressive heart, you're really not the one"
She comes to the door, crying at my feet
Guilt shines in her eyes, as she slowly sinks in deep

You know, our love couldn't last forever
Persuade your way, but you ain't clever
I close the door and I say never

I don't care, what you're sayin'
Walk right now, I ain't playin'
Love elsewhere, for you, I'm prayin'
Don't look back, you ain't stayin'

Here, I'm crying, I can't sleep
I sigh, 'cause I thought this would never be
I say "Ooh, (Ooh) I'm screamin' out for someone" (Aah, aah, yeah)
And now she's knockin' on the door for me (Hee-hee-hee)
She just won't leave me alone (Yeah) (Hee-hee)
She wants to speak with me (Speak with me)
And persuade me in her arms (Hee-hee-hee)
And now she's callin' on the phone for me, just won't leave me alone
Deep down inside, she's trying to be clever
To love once more then leave me forever
I close the door and I say never

I don't care, what you're sayin'
Walk right now, I ain't playin'
Love elsewhere, for you, I'm prayin'
Don't look back, you ain't stayin'
I don't care, what you're sayin'
Walk right now, why'd you do it to me?
(Love elsewhere) Why'd you do it to me?
(Don't look back) Hoo!


I try so hard to cope with you
I can't bear with the things you put me through
To love as friends, I wish that we could see
But persuasive heart, you just won't let pure friendship be

You know, our love couldn't last forever
Persuade your way, but you ain't clever
I close the door and I say never
I don't care, what you're sayin'
Walk right now, I ain't playin'
Love elsewhere, for you, I'm prayin'
Don't look back, you ain't stayin'
I don't care, what you're sayin'
Walk right now, I ain't playin'
Love elsewhere, for you, I'm prayin'
(Don't look back) Why'd you do it to me?
(I don't care) Why'd you do it to me?
(Walk right now) Why'd you do it to me?
(Love elsewhere) Why'd you do it to me?
(Don't look back) Hoo!


(Hee-hee-hee)
(Hee-hee-hee)
(Hee-hee-hee)
(Hee-hee-hee)
(Hee-hee-hee)
(Hee-hee-hee)
(Yeah, oh, baby)
I don't care
Walk right now
Love elsewhere
Don't look back
I don't care
Walk right now
Love elsewhere
Don't look back
I don't care2Embed
