Give It Up Lyrics
I don't know what you do to me
But this feeling is here to be
I hope it's love and one day we'll see the moon
Take my hand and we'll fly away
A love so new 'til the dying day
A life so true all you have to say is you will

You've got to believe in something
You've got to believe in
Give it up
Give it up
My love is true now
Say me and you now
Give it up
Give it up

Just say the word and I'm screaming out your name
So make it true, to make it us
Just give me half a chance
I need your love
Hope it's me you're thinkin' of
A love to give, I can't live
Just give me half the chance
I don't know what you do to me
But this feeling is here to be
Just say that you'll be giving me your love
All you got to do is
Give it up, give it up, ooh
Give it up, give it up, ah
Give it up, give it up, ooh
Give it up, give it up

You've got to believe in something
You've got to believe me
Give it up
Give it up
My love is true now
Say me and you now
Give it up
Give it up

Just say the word and I'm screaming out your name
So make it true, to make it us
Just give me half a chance
I need your love
Hope it's me you're thinkin' of
A love to give, I can't live
Just give me half the chance
I don't know what you do to me
But this feeling is here to be
Just say that you'll be giving me your love

All you got to do is
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up4Embed
