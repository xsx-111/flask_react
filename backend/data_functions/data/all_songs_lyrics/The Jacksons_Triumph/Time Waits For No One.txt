Time Waits For No One Lyrics
Lonely, in my darkened room
Sad and weary, persevering for love, for love
Sad and weary, persevering

And I hope that she is thinkin'
To come back to me
Is it possible she's thinkin' of me at all?
Have I gone too far?

If only, I had shown her love
She'd be with me, deep inside me
My love, my love
She'd be with me, deep inside me

And I hope that she is thinkin'
To come back to me
And I pray that faith can bear
This suffering inside 'til she arrives

And I hope that she is thinkin'
To come back to me
And I'm scared there's someone sleepin' by her side
I can't hide all the pain deep inside, is this love?
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one1Embed
