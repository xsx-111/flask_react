Lovely One Lyrics
Ooh!

Why don't you believe me when I say that I love you?
I'm crazy 'bout you
You wear the face that tells me you think my lovin' ain't true
I'm all about ya
You're my desire, I get higher every time I speak your name
All I do (That’s all I do, that’s all I do, that’s all I do)
And the way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you

Now, the first time that I saw you walkin' down the street, so pretty
Go on with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love when it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's drivin' me insane

You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
(Ooh!)
(Hoo!)

Why don't you believe me when I say that I am true?
I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm here to love and please you I'll do what you want me to
I'm all about ya'
Livin' and hopin', but I'm copin'
With these things you put me through
All I do (That’s all I do, that’s all I do, that’s all I do)
The way that I can't sleep at night just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you

Now, the first time that I saw you walkin' down the street, so pretty
Go on with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love you when it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's drivin' me insane

You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
(Uh!) (Ooh!) (Hoo!)
(Ooh!)
(Yeah!)

You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one (Hoo!)
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one

Oh, everything I do
You're the one I care, that’s all I'm askin' for
Love you hard, my baby, that’s all I wanna say
You're the one I care, that’s all I'm askin' for
Know you are my love
My lovely one, that’s all I'm askin' for
That’s all I'm askin' for, that’s all I'm askin' for
Love you hard, my girl, yeah
