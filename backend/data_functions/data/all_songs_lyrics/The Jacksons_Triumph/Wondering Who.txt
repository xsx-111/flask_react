Wondering Who Lyrics
I've got you wondering who
Look what you put me through
No more planning to start anew
I've got you wondering who
I come to you to love you once again
But you never were around
How can you say that we were more than friends
When there's no love to be found?

'Cause in my mind
I knew that you weren't true
From time to time
Look what you put me through

I thought that you and I had seen the light
During the first time we met
Seem to be a sudden change in life
Is there a need for someone else?

'Cause in my mind
I knew that you weren't true
From time to time
Look what you put me through
Aah ...
Welcome to the night
(Stop holding on, start being strong)
Stayed up all night
(Stop holding on, 'cause love is gone)
Welcome to the night
(Stop holding on, start being strong)
Stayed up all night
Baby you've got to go
(Michael: Hee hee hee)

I've got you wondering who
Look what you put me through
No more planning to start anew
I've got you wondering who
I went along, thought it would be alright
Maybe it happened all too fast
Lots of torrid danger hampered me
Left me crying all the time

'Cause in my mind
I knew that you weren't true
From time to time
Look what you put me through
Ahh ...
Welcome to the night
(Stop holding on, start being strong)
Stayed up all night
(Stop holding on, 'cause love is gone)
Welcome to the night
(Stop holding on, start being strong)
Stayed up all night
(Stop holding on, 'cause love is gone)
Stop holding on, start being strong
(Michael: Love is gone, hee hee hee)
Stop holding on, 'cause love is gone
(Love is gone, hee hee hee)
Stop holding on, start being strong
(Love is gone, hee hee hee)
Stop holding on, 'cause love is gone
(Love is gone, hee hee hee)
Stop holding on, start being strong
(Love is gone, hee hee hee)
Stop holding on, 'cause love is gone
(Love is gone, hee hee hee)
Stop holding on, start being strong
(Love is gone, hee hee hee)
Baby you've got to go2Embed
