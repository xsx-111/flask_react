Love Will Fuck Us Apart LyricsYou and me go together like carrots and peas
We should be a happy family
Or a traveling travesty at least
And love will fuck us up
Love will fuck us up
Breathe in deep
Breathe as deeply as you can breathe
Breathe deep 'till you're drunk with glee
Breathe deep 'till you're drunk with glee
And love will fuck us up
Love will fuck us upEmbed
