Love in the Time of Human Papillomavirus LyricsYou will cough up crows that peck my eyes
And I will do nothing but go blind
But my heart, it has eyes
And my love, it has sight
Even though it may be a little cloudy
And you will break my back for all the burdens I lay upon it
But I will never blame you for those bees inside this bonnet
And my lungs will grow cancers
And my back it will grow achy
I will buy us an acre
Of some land in the city
We could live there together
Or I'll live alone less happy
But I'll live
