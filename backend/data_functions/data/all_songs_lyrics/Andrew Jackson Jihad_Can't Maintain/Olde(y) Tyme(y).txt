Olde(y) Tyme(y) LyricsI've had a bad day
I am ashamed
And I'm afraid
And I am drained of what was named
Self respect
If the bridge that I was driving over
Collapsed while I was driving over it
That may not be such a bad thing
I would finally meet my maker
I would meet the great creator
And I would punch him for teaching me how to sing
And my body would be at the bottom of a lake in West Virginia
Instead of the bottom of this bottle I drink
I don't have a drinking problem
Don't have a drinking solution
I don't think I ever learned to think
And no one knows what it's like to be
Anybody but themselves
No one, no one, no one elseEmbed
