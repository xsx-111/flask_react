Sense, Sensibility Lyrics
Earnesty and clarity
Those wonderful mentalities of decent positivity
Are all that we can strive
But misery and poverty
They follow me, my family
And though it seems that I can't win
I think I have to try
But everyone's afraid of me
They'll never see that we all bleed
The same damned blood each night

So you'll go your way and I'll go mine
I hope we meet up later on down the line

And sense and sensibility and peaceful productivity
A pretty girl with broken wings is all that I desire
But there's so much hostility in all the things surrounding me
The awful glow of enmity is trying to stop my shine
So I tried to look inwardly at all the things inside of me
But sodomy and buggery keep bubbling to the top

So you'll go forwards and I'll go back
I hope we catch up with each other on the track
And I've been thinking awkwardly about the things that are holy
Like Jesus, Joseph and Mary, and Mary Magdalene
And even theoretically, I don't think I could ever see
The perfect human being, Jesus, live without sin

So you'll go upward and I'll go down
You'll go upward and I'll go down
You'll go upward and I'll go down
I'll see you in Hell when we die1Embed
