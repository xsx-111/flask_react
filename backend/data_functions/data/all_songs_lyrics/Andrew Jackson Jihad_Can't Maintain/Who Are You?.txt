Who Are You? Lyrics
Who are you?
And where did you go?
And where are you from?
And what do you know?
You're in my blood
And you're in my hair
You're in my heart
And you're in the air

I met you once over the phone
You sounded sad and you seemed alone
You left me but I never left you
I never had the chance to

Music was the one thing
We would have had in common
You were my age when I was born
Would I have done what you did?
Would I do what you have done?
I like to think I'm a bigger man than that

You had some problems with alcohol
You took 12 steps and you solved them all
It took 16 years for you to call
What gave you the brave to pick up that ball?
You played the trumpet and the drums
While my mom sang at funerals
I play guitar till my hands are numb
You two are where music comes from for me

So thank you so much for not raising me
You spent your life on better things
And you would have been an awful dad
Thank you though for those genes you hadEmbed
