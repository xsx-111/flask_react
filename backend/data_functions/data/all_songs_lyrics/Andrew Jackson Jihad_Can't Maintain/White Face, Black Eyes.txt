White Face, Black Eyes LyricsThey had a white face
They had black eyes
They had burns all over their bodies
They had love for my revulsion
And they kissed away my repulsion
They had a white face
And black eyes
The father came
From across the sea
To rescue, rescue
To rescue me
He said "If you spend all your heart
On something that has died
You are not alive
And that can't be your life"
Love what you can
Love what you can 'til it dies
Then let it lie
Let it fly
Away
Love what you can
Love what you can 'til it dies
Then let it lie
Let it fly
Away
He had a white face
He had black eyes
He had burns all over his body
And he was right1Embed
