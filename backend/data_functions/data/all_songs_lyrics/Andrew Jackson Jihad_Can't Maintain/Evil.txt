Evil LyricsNo one will know how evil I really am
No one will know how evil I really am
'Cause I like to wear disguises
And I like to disguise my plans
No one will know how evil I really am
And no one will know truly how I feel
And no one will know how I truly feel
'Cause I can no longer differentiate
Between what is fake and what is real
I don't know how I feel
I was born in a hospital
My first two days were spent in the care of nuns
But my mother found it in her
To go ahead and take me back
And I love her
And I will always appreciate bad days like this
Because they grant me a point of reference in regards to my happiness
And although I feel cold and empty one day
I hope I can feel warm and full
Stand with honor, and comfort, and dignityEmbed
