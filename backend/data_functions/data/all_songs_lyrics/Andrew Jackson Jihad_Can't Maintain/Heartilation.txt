Heartilation Lyrics
I wanna break apart my heart
Glue the pieces to my car
Crash it into a wall
I don't want to feel at all
I want to break apart my heart
Douse it in gasoline
So the fire burns clean
Flick a cigarette like that movie Con Air
Doused in gasoline

And if you think you are better than me
You're right
There's no one to love
There's no one to trust
In my life

I want to pick up the pieces
And plant them in the ground
When a tree grows there
I want to chop that tree down
Build it into a boat
And float it in a lake
And with dynamite
I will explode that thing
That makes me make mistakes
And if you think you are better than me
You're right
There's no one to love
There's no one to trust
In my life

Sometimes I get so lonesome
I can't breathe
Sometimes I get so scared
That I can't speak
Sometimes I get so worried
I can't hear my heart beat
Anyway, anyway

I wanna tear out my heart
And give it away
To a person more deserving one day
And if all I see
Is the worst in everything
That's all I'm gonna get
That's all I'm gonna get
That's all I'm gonna get
And if you think you are better than me
You're right
There's no one to love
There's no one to trust
In my life
There's no one to love
No one to trust
In my life
No one to love
There's no one to trust
In my life1Embed
