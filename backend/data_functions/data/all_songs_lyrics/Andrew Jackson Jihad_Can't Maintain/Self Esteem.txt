Self Esteem Lyrics
This place has taken all my self-esteem
And everybody is afraid of me
And I can't make eye contact with anyone I see
This place has taken all my self-esteem

And everybody is afraid of me
And I'm afraid to go out in the streets
Reminders of my failures everywhere that I will be
Everybody is afraid of me

And people freak me out
People make me scared
People make me so damn self-aware

I get bronchitis twice a year at least
My lungs aren't the way that they should be
And I smoke more than a motherfucking chimney
I declare war on my body

And I'm a liar and I am a thief
Taking things from those better than me
Pathetic little man with some pathetic little dream
I hope you all can forgive me1Embed
