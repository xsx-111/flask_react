March of the Chrome Police (A Cold Clamey Bombing) LyricsI don't care much about your situation
You've got too strange of a fascination
You've got an active imagination
A cold, clammy bombing
A cold, clammy bombing
A cold, clammy bombing
Will ruin your town
I hear all the paranoid discussions
Trying to distract me from my functions
But I don't care what you say, I'm not afraid of the Russians
A cold, clammy bombing
A cold, clammy bombing
A cold, clammy bombing
Will ruin your town
A cold, clammy bombing
A cold, clammy bombing
A cold, clammy bombing
Will ruin your town
Some say they saw you lighting up the fuse
Well at last the fucking box will get some use
Modern equipment can't take much abuse
A cold, clammy bombing
A cold, clammy bombing
A cold, clammy bombing
Will shit on your townEmbed
