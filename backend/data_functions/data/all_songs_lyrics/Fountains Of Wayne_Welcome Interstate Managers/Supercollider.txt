Supercollider LyricsMulticolored microbus
Plowing over rugged terrain
We're jacking the radio
Passing the afternoon train
Around the roses
She showed us hyacinths and sage
Gold-plated garden tools
Sunlamps, and it's all the rage
Stay low to the ground or they'll sniff you out
You never know what you will find
When you go out of the blackness
Into the great big sky
Supercollider
Shooting inside your mind
Gather round the gas tower
Don't it kinda look like a bong?
I heard it backwards
Hidden in a Pink Floyd song
Stella radiata
It's got to set your mind at ease
Spinning on the tire swing
Flying like Tarzan through the trees
And back to the bus when the sun goes down
Try to aim it back into town
We're riding out of the blackness
Into the great big sky
Supercollider
Shooting inside your mind
Supercollider
Shooting inside your mind
And coriander grows along the banks
Where we go walking at night
Creeping slowly over the grounds
We tiptoe round the garden
Trying not to tramp it down
Stay low to the ground or they'll sniff you out
You never know what you will find
When you go out of the blackness
Into the great big sky
Supercollider
Shooting inside your mind
Supercollider
Shooting inside your mindEmbed
