Peace and Love LyricsPeace and Love
Peace and Love
That's all I'm thinkin of, baby
Peace and Love
Peace and Love
Peace and Love
That's all I'm think of, baby
Peace and Love
Ridin' around in a Volkswagon van
Thinkin' bout the people upside-down in Japan
Starin' at the stars in a distant galaxy
Wonderin' if there's someone out there starin back at me
Singin' Peace and Love (Peace and Love)
Peace and Love (Peace and Love)
That's all I'm think of, baby
Peace and Love
Peace and Love (Peace and Love)
Peace and Love (Peace and Love)
That's all I'm think of, baby
Peace and Love
Lyin' on the floor just playin my guitar
Tryin' to find the chords for just the way you are
Plane crash flashin on my TV
Well it coulda been you, baby it coulda been me
We'll never live forever
But maybe things could be worse
Cause when we get together
We are one with the universe
Woohoo Woohoo
Sometimes I think I might just move up to Vermont
Open up a bookstore or a vegan restaurant
Got crazy karma never harmed a single soul
So if you wanna join me, then together we'll grow old
Peace and Love (Peace and Love)
Peace and Love (Peace and Love)
That's all I'm think of, baby
Peace and Love
Peace and Love (Peace and Love)
Peace and Love (Peace and Love)
That's all I'm think of, baby
Peace and LoveEmbed
