Bought for a Song LyricsCome on, now get your ass out of bed
You heard what the man said
The crew is already gone
We were all kinda high, but man what were you on?
Tried to take a shuttle to Spain
They kicked me off of the plane
I guess I'll go to Japan
It all looks the same when you stump for the man
And down in the valley we crawl in the alley
Who knew the 101 was so long?
Before you get sold, you get bought for a song
Sake in aluminum cans
It fell in the wrong hands
And now we're chewing the scene
Stumbling out of the Lexington Queen
Walking through a German hotel
And not walking very well
I gotta get to the van
Excuse me, I'm weaving as fast as I can
And Tom won't admit he got lost in the city
He's saying that the directions are wrong
Before you get sold, you get bought for a song
Before you get sold, you get bought for a song
And down in the valley we crawl in the alley
Who knew the 101 was so long?
Before you get sold, you get bought for a song
Before you get sold, you get bought for a song
Before you get sold, you get bought for a songEmbed
