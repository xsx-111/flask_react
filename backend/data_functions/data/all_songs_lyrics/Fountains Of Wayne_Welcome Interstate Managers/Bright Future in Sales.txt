Bright Future in Sales LyricsSleepin' on a planter at the Port Authority
Waitin' for my bus to come
Seven scotch-and-sodas at the office party
Now I don't remember where I'm from
I think I had a black wallet
In my back pocket
With a bus ticket
And a picture of my baby inside
And if I make it home alive
I'm gonna get my shit together (together)
Cause I can't live like this forever (forever)
You know I've come too far
And I don't wanna fail
I got a new computer
And a bright future in sales
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
A bright future in sales
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah) yeah yeah
Headin' for the airport on a misty morning
Gonna catch a flight to Baltimore
Try to kill an hour with a whiskey sour
If there's time I might have just one more
I gotta do some quick readin'
For the big meetin'
But my head is spinnin'
And I can't quite open my eyes
As long as I don't have to drive
I'm gonna get my shit together (together)
Cause I can't live like this forever (forever)
You know I've come too far
And I don't wanna fail
I got a new computer and a
Bright future in sales
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
A bright future in sales
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
A bright future in sales
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
A bright future in sales
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah) yeah yeah
I had a line on a brand new account
But now I can't seem to find
Where I wrote that number down
I try to focus, I'm starin' at the screen
Pretendin' like I know
What all these little flashin' lights mean
Oh yeah
I gotta do some quick readin'
For the big meetin'
But my head is spinnin'
And I can't quite open my eyes
I gotta get my shit together (together)
Cause I can't live like this forever (forever)
You know I've come too far and I don't wanna fail
I got a new computer
And a bright future in sales
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
A bright future in sales
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
A bright future in sales
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
A bright future in sales
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah) yeah yeah1Embed
