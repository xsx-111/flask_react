Hung Up On You LyricsWhile I down Kentucky bourbon, I am waiting for a call
And the moon and stars tonight are playing shadows on the wall
With the moon the way it is, dear, would you answer out of spite?
Or are you feeling lonely tonight?
Cuz I remember last time we were out under the stars
Driving crooked down the highway, drinking beer in roadside bars
Now and then I wonder why this painful memory
Can never find its way to you from me
And I can't dial the phone just now, even though I know your number
Can't bring my broken heart to be untrue
Like you did today, you'll say goodbye the same old way
Ever since you hung up on me, I'm hung up on you
Well the house I'm ringing up from is a half a mile from you
But with the reception I'm getting, might as well be Timbuktu
And behind the door of your home is a strange and foreign land
Where you speak a language I don't understand
And I can't dial the phone just now, even though I know your number
Can't bring my broken heart to be untrue
Like you did today, you'll say goodbye the same old way
Ever since you hung up on me, I'm hung up on you
Now I'm goin down to Jimmy's bar like a thousand other times
With an appetite for poison and a suitcase full of dimes
And I'll wait there by the payphone with one hundred other guys
With those sorry hung up teardrops in our eyes
And I can't dial the phone just now, even though I know your number
Can't bring my broken heart to be untrue
Like you did today, you'll say goodbye the same old way
Ever since you hung up on me, I'm hung up on you
Ever since you hung up on me, I'm hung up on youEmbed
