Hey Julie Lyrics
Working all day for a mean little man
With a clip-on tie and a rub-on tan
He's got me running 'round the office like a dog around a track
But when I get back home, you're always there to rub my back

Hey Julie, look what they're doing to me
Trying to trip me up, trying to wear me down
Julie, I swear, it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
No, I'd never make it through without you around

Hours on the phone making pointless calls
I got a desk full of paper that means nothing at all
Sometimes I catch myself staring into space
Counting down the hours 'til I get to see your face

Hey Julie, look what they're doing to me
Trying to trip me up, trying to wear me down
Julie, I swear, it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
No, I'd never make it through without you around
How did it come to be that you and I must be
Far away from each other every day?
Why must I spend my time filling up my mind
With facts and figures that never add up anyway?
They never add up anyway

Working all day for a mean little guy
With a bad toupee and a soup-stained tie
He's got me running 'round the office like a gerbil on a wheel
He can tell me what to do, but he can't tell me what to feel

Hey Julie, look what they're doing to me
Trying to trip me up, trying to wear me down
Julie, I swear, it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
No, I'd never make it through without you around
No, I'd never make it through without you around1Embed
