Velvet Ring LyricsShoved in the kitchen of a city tomb
The light would flicker like a violent womb
The night was thicker than a smoky fume
Liza waited in the room
Benny loved her like he loved no one
The way she'd laugh and hold a smoking gun
The way she always said, "What's done is done."
And he was not the only one
Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
A victim healer with a sharp sharp blade
Benny knew how she was getting paid
Her water broke and they would have to wade
When he knew that she was fooling
He faced the mirror to avoid the thing said
We're outta money and we sold the bling
And I just wanna take you home, I just wanna take you home
Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
And I am wandering
I am wandering4Embed
