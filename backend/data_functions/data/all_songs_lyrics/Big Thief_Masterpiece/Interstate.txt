Interstate LyricsThough you let her down
You don't need to carry
What's far from here is not so scary
Though you cannot see her
You don't have to worry
She needs your hand though your eyes are blurry
She is getting thin
You are growing gray and white
And you don't know how to tell her as you say goodnight
Interstate, poison freeway
Takes you down the line
You could go back in time
You could hold her close
At night in your slumber
Dream her as a child when you loved her mother
Now you're in her house
She is smiling in a dress
She is not a woman, you are just a guest
Interstate, poison freeway
Takes you down the line
You could go back in time1Embed
