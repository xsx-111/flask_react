Vegas LyricsHoled up in Vegas for only one week
And I caught you tongue and cheek by the side of the road
Of an automobile expo
Turned up the volume and you started to weep
And I thought you a lamb
Even in the sigh of the headlight sea
Your tears were salty ocean
You opened up the engine and listened to it sing
And I thought you a lamb
You knew your daddy 'til you were thirteen
And then he took his leave for the likes of the land
And the far off salty ocean
We shook our bodies and we started to scream
And I asked you again
Tell me when we grow up, do we ever go home?
You said home becomes the highway
We ordered movies on a motel screen
Until you needed me warm inside of your mouth
And my skin was salty ocean
And then you recommended I'm a woman to keep
And I called you a manEmbed
