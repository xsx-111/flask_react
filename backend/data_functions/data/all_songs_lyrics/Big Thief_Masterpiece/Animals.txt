Animals LyricsThe animals are wonderful
Such a vision in the sun, how they lay low
I catch my breath and count my dough
And I only live to run and I need to go
You and I were born and I'll make you make your mind up
Oh me
She always knew
She'll always know
That I loved her oh so well, but I need to go
You and I were born and I'll make you make your mind up
Oh me
You and I were born with the same design
Nothing in the world will make you make your mind up
If I had a choice I'd wait to find
Nothing in your eyes will tell me where you'll lie
Oh me3Embed
