Humans LyricsHumans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection alright
Why in the morn of one bad night
Do I fight your touch like a fever
Human man you loosen my mind
Loosen my hand from the beckoning knife
How in the fortress of your eye
Do you lay me down a believer?
I can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
Humans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection alright
Why in the morn of one bad night
Do I fight your touch like a fever
I can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
I'm fooling my heart
Fooling my heart
I'm fooling my heart
Fooling my heart
Humans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection alright
Why in the morn of one bad night
Do I fight your touch like a fever
I can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't seeEmbed
