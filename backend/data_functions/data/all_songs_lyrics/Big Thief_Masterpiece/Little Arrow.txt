Little Arrow LyricsGo little arrow
Shoot like a wave through the tongue of the taro
Bloom every morning
The water, the pepper
The egg, the warming
Still play that old reel
From every angle
Pushing the baby
The blood, the tangle
Old light leaking
Is it, could it, was it dreaming?
Still play that old reel
Still play that old reel2Embed
