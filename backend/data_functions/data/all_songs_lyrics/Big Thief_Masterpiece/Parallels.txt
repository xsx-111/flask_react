Parallels Lyrics
Don't I make you feel alive?
Don't I give you a good home?
In a way I know you're always by my side
But today I think I've always been a long way

One hand to keep me warm
One hand to hold my chin
To be inside your arms
It's all I'm asking

Caterpillar on the floor
Can you teach me to transform?
I'll step right in and cocoon 'til I'm born
And I can't say that I'll miss my human form much

One hand to keep me warm
One hand to hold my chin
To be inside your arms
It's all I'm asking

I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all
