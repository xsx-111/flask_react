Will to Reach LyricsIn simple sermons it began:
"You are not yourself, you are me
There are only these words
And by them shall you live"
So forged was the mask of thousands
As child's face dissolves
Who so speaks shall name him
Who so calls will bring him
To his knees
I will dance for you
Behind the mask
Something small fiercely gleams
All that's needed to claim the light
Is the will to reachEmbed
