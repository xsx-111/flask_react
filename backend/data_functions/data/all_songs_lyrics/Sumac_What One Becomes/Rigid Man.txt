Rigid Man LyricsBehind closed doors
Lanterns sway in pulsing dark
Though the body's near
Rigid man with soiled hands
Cannot touch, cannot feel
Between walls in narrow cell
Glaring light extinguished
Cover, tender scalp exposed
Rigid man falls to summons, red
Drained and weak
Flaccid body, bent in muddied gutter
No truth unwrung from its marrow cold
Begs for mercy, for cleansing holy death
Only broken may it pass
Into golden dawn
ForgivenEmbed
