Image of Control Lyrics(1)
Turn aside
Steady eyes belie the fear
Small hollow words, clatter to the ground
Broken
(2)
Ruin has come, not fire
Or in ashen rain
Only in turgid silence
Hanging, flayed
Submerged in presence summoned
It expands with breath, filling rooms
Welling up from the tar choked springs
Reeking black star, shining weary light
Bloodied eyes, no tears
Bloodied eyes, no light
Know not to what this moment's owed
Only slipping in shuddering dance
Towards cold, radiant dissolve1Embed
