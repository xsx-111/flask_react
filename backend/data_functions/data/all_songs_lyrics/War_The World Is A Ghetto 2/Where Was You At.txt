Where Was You At LyricsI been down on my bending knees
Where was you at?
Where was you at?
I've even sailed the seven seas
Where was you at?
Where was you at?
I looked around for someone to help me
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
I looked around for someone to help me
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
(Yeah!)
I've been here & there...everywhere
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
Talkin' 'bout 'round the world - lookin' for you, girl
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
I looked around for someone to help me
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
I've been here and there...everywhere
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
Where was you at? (Where was you at?)
I looked...and I looked...
My pony, she bolts from end to end
Let me tell ya now, a dog is a man's best friend
Hey!
...But a canine can't be mine (Huh!)Embed
