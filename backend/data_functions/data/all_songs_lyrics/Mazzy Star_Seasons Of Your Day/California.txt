California LyricsI think I'm going back to California
Somewhere distant and it's all far away
It's so far, it's so far far away
I think I'll drift across the ocean now
Clouds look so clear in your eyes
Let me bring all my, let me bring all my friends
I think I'll fly across the ocean
I can watch the sky turning grey
I think I'm going back, I think I'll go back
I think I hear the whisper of my own best friend
I think I hear the bells ringing in the square
California, California3Embed
