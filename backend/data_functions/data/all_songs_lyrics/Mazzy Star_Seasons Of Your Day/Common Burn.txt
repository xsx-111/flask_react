Common Burn LyricsSimple things like your over coat
And your beauty
That's still burning me
Let me hang around
Even if it's just some way to have
Some common burn
A common burn
So I spend the night in someone's house
That you clouded
Oh simple me that you fled
But we have that in common
A common burn
A common burn
Aware of atoms, I said
So many times before
You could sit around and have
Everything that you scored
Just don't come home and say
You've been asleep
When you know you're burning
Someone
That common burn
That common burnEmbed
