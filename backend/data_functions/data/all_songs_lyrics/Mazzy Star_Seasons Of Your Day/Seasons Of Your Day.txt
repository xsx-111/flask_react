Seasons Of Your Day Lyrics
Won't you let me come inside?
I've released all of my pride
And I know you're alone, 'cause I've been there

I was storming all of the day, outside your door
It's a misery, that the rivers will never stream me back before

I know you've been missing me
Well, you know, I've been missing you too

And all my miles away, let me know your reason
It's my mistake not to you understand
The seasons of your day that you change


Won't you let me come inside?
I've released all of my pride
And I know you're alone, 'cause I've been there

I know you've been missing me
Well, you know, I've been missing you tooEmbed
