In the Kingdom LyricsI took that train into the city
You know the one that goes under the bridge
I thought I was listening
To a band play a song that changed me
Hey hey hey hey hey hey
Walked up the stairs, the sunlight hit my face
See all the people just stand around
If all is right in the kingdom tonight
You know we'll play songs in this town
Hey hey hey hey hey hey
I took that train into the city
You know the one that goes under the bridge
I thought I was listening
To this band play a song that changed me
Hey hey hey hey hey hey1Embed
