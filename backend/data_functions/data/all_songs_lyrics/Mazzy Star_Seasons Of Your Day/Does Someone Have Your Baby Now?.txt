Does Someone Have Your Baby Now? LyricsDoes someone have your baby now?
Does someone flame your fire and day?
Count your skies in the dark
And turns your head around
Does someone know your smile and laugh?
Does someone send you and pass
Spins your world around
And I'll lose the right thing as well
I don't wanna get it on with you
Don't wanna get it on
Does someone have your baby now
Does someone flame your fire and day
Count your skies in the dark
And turns your head around
I don't wanna get it on with you
Don't wanna get it onEmbed
