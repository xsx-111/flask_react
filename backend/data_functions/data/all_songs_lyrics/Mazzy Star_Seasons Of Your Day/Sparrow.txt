Sparrow LyricsYou used to say don't give me things
Look at me with your cold eyes, you know what I'm saying
You used to say I got a heart like a sparrow
And a smile just like clay
And now a calm word would soothe you
And a smile from my heart would suffice
You used to say I'll be fine on my own
Give me one bottle of wine and two for the road
You used to say I've got a heart like a sparrow
And a smile just like clayEmbed
