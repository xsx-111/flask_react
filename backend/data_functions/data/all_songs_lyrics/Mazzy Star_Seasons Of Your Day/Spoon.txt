Spoon LyricsI ain't no spoon
Ain't nobody gonna turn me around
I ain't no spoon
Ain't nobody gonna turn me around
Put your sapphire away
On the window  day
That's right
That's right
I ain't no spoon
Ain't nobody gonna spin me around
I ain't no spoon
Ain't nobody gonna spin me around
People so fine on the right
Far enough if I'm the left side
I ain't no spoon
Ain't nobody gonna spin me around
No, not me
No, not me
Put your sapphire back
On the western light
That's right
That's rightEmbed
