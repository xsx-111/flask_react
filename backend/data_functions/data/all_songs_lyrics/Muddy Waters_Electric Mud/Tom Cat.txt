Tom Cat Lyrics
Yeah you know I'm a tomcat and you's my kitten
And I'm scratching around in your windowpane
Yeeeah you know I'm a tomcat and you's my kitten
And I've been scratching around in your windowpane
Let me in let me in baby
So I can feel good all over again
Yeah you know i'm a tomcat and you's my kitten
And im just sitting here licking my paws
Yeeeeeeah you know I'm a tomcat and you's my kitten
And im just sitting here licking my paws
Well you know (young girl I'm dreaming )
I wat to strike you back with my claw
Yeah you know I'm a tomcat and you's my kitten
And I want you like a hooping owl
Yeah you know I'm a tomcat and you's my kitten
And I just want you like a hoopin owl
Yeah you going to be sleepin when I'm creeping
When I make my midnight pounce
Yeah you know I'm a tomcat and you's my kitten
I'm going to bite you with my fang
Yeeeah you's a tom cat little kitten
Im going to bite you with my fang
Im going to () you little girl
And make you feel good all over again
Im going to bite you with my fang
Yeah you know yous going to my little kitten
Im going to get even you one day
Yeah you know yous my little kitten
Going to catch up with you one day
Yeah you know I'm going to get you girl
I'm going to get you to go my wayEmbed
