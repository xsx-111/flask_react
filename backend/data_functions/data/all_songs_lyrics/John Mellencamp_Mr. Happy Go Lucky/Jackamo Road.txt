Jackamo Road LyricsI'd like to buy you a cabin cruiser
And we could sail around with our time
I'd like to get you, a southern mansion
And we could burn it down, down to the ground
But I'm movin on down
To Jackamo Road
On my way thru Georgia
And all the points unknown
Yeah, I'm going to heaven
I'll come back to get you
Someday Someday SomedayEmbed
