Life Is Hard LyricsLife is hard anyway you cut it
Life is sweet, like a berry from a tree
Life is temptation, Baby, every single day
Life is hard
Life is funny, I don't mean ha-ha
It's not always sunny, when it needs to be
Life is frightening, nothing lasts forever
Life is hard
My time
Is next to nothin
My time
Falls on you, yeah
Everything
Is in motion
Life is hard
Life is precious, no matter how you see it
Life is crazy, like yellow fishes in the street
Life is lonely when you're not with me
Life is hard
Gentlemen
Is that you story?
Hanging religion from a tree, yeah
My time is next to nothing
Life is hard
My time
Is next to nothing
My time
Falls on you, yeah
Everything
Is in motion
Life is hard
My time
Falls on you, yeah
Life is hard
Life is hardEmbed
