Large World Turning LyricsSomeday this will all be over
Nothing lasts forever
Thank god for change
I love you now, we should stay together
No one's crying about a single thing
Large world turning
Live while you can
Live while you can
Large world turning
Live while you can
Live while you can
You may sleep where your lover leads you
Come and brush these crumbs from my bed
Tell me the truth, I will never leave you
I'll be happy by the baby's bed
Large world turning
Live while you can
Live while you can
Large world turning
Live while you can
Live while you can
When this world becomes an ocean
We will find the desert
Right next to the pig's tail
And watch the summer sun
Corrugated roofs with little white houses
Hide the dogs that walk on three legs
Someday this will all be over
No one's playing that pissin game
Large world turning
Live while you can
Live while you can
Large world turning
No one can see the end
Large world turning
No one sees the end
No one sees the end
Large world turning
Live while you can
Live while you canEmbed
