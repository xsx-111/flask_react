Circling Around the Moon LyricsThere may come a day when you grow weary
Troubled waters stain the paper cup
From other venues, other voices carry
Spilled dreams soaking into thirsty dust
Maybe then and there you'll find another
Lover with a blank and empty heart
Filled with breath and old sails to discover
Strength to push the seas apart
On the day we met
I began to want you
On the day we met
I began to lose you too
Both of us circling round the moon
Both of us circling round the moon
There may come a day when you feel anger
China cracked and glued by clumsy hands
Veins of memory touching only hunger
The heart devours what it cannot understand
On the day we met
I began to want you
On the day we met
I began to lose you too
Both of us circling round the moon
Both of us circling round the moon
Maybe it was then I saw my future
Saw it as a shadow on the ground
Beneath the earth old nails to discover
Strength to hold my body down
On the day we met
I began to want you
On the day we met
I began to lose you too
Both of us circling round the moon
On the day we met
I began to want you, want you
On the day we met
I began to lose you too
Both of us circling round the moon
The both or us circling round the moon
Both of us circling round the moonEmbed
