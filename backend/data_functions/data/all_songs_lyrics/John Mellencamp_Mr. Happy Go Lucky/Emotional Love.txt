Emotional Love Lyrics(Sally in the roses)
I woke up today
Everything's on my shoulders
I never told her
Such emotional love
I hear what you say
Yes I owe ya
But I don't know ya
And I smash soldiers with love
I'll come there today
To your station
It's recreation
This passing notion of love
I hear what you say
It's demonstration
Crossing oceans above
Crossing oceans above
Hand on my shoulder
Like I told her
I control ya
Crossing oceans above
Sally in the roses
What she knows is
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Not for beginners
Or Sunday sinners
Court disasters
A.J just killed his love
Who's on the left and right
Lonely days and nights
Who's your master
When gods pass motions above
I hear what you play
On your station
Smashing Soldiers with love
Crossing oceans above
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
I woke up today
Everything's on my shoulders
I never told her
Such emotional love
I hear what you say
Yes I know ya
But I don't owe ya
And I smash soldiers with love
I'll come there today
To your station
It's recreation
This passing notion of love
Is crossing oceans above
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional love
Such emotional loveEmbed
