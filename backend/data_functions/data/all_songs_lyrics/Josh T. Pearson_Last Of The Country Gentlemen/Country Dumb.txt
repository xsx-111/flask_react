Country Dumb LyricsI come from a long line in history of dreamers
Each one more tired than the one before
All of us too poor to pay attention
Sweet dreamin' was all we could afford
They say that even in the worst hope overcometh
But not in this cold lonely world of mine
So if your warm thoughts ever wander up to good heavens
Say a prayer of hope for my driftin', sweet dreamin' mind
We are not what you call over-comers
We are failures each and every one
Weï¿½re the kind who will always need a Saviour
The kind who play country dumb
I come from a long line in history of dreamers
Too broke down to frankly my dear give a good god dime
Too poor in spirit to rent to own it alone
Even qualify for that ever elusive pre-approved new lease on life
We're the kind who never take responsibility
Yeah the only thing I will ever take from you will be my leave
And the only good thing I'll ever give to you will be my good grief
I've counted the cost sister Christian I know that Jesus saves cuz nothing in this cold lonely world is for free!
There are reasons that I was alone when I met you
Reasons that go back a long long way in time
There are reasons that I am surely going to leave you
They come from a circle in history woman that ain't hardly even mine
And in this unbroken circle I will be the first at the end of the line
We're the kind who start the books but who just do not finish
We're the kind who have 10,000 would-be-great, ungrateful, too-long, run-on songs
We're the kind still stuck in the past but who see well into the circle future
You see I miss you woman and baby you ain't even yet gone
You see I miss you babe and woman you ain't even yet gone
I come from a long line in history of dreamers
Each one more tired than the one before
All of us too poor to pay attention
Sweet dreamin' was all we could afford
We are not what you call over-comers
We are failures each and every one
Weï¿½re the kind who will always need a Saviour
The kind who play country dumb
The kind who play country dumbEmbed
