Thou Art Loosed LyricsDon't cry for me babe, you'll learn to live without me
Don't cry for me babe, I'll learn to live without you
Don't cry, no don't cry for me
Don't cry for me babe, I'll learn to live without you
Don't cry for me babe, you'll learn to live without me
Don't cry, no don't you cry for me
'Cause I'm off to save the world
I'm off to save the world
I'm off to save the world
At least I can hope
I'm off to save the world
I'm off to save the world
Well I'm off to save the world
At least I can hope
At least I
I can hopeEmbed
