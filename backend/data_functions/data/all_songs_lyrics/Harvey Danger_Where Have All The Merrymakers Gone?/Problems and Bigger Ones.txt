Problems and Bigger Ones Lyrics
Cross through the border states
To the wrong side, wrong side
And look away, Virginia

Spend every day like the past is a bridge
Crossing twenty years
Whispers away, not so much
Get your poison tongue out of my ear
Here's a fact you cannot rise above
We'll have problems
Yeah, then we'll have bigger ones

From damaged to damned control
You wanted to go alone, though
I've never said no, I never said no
I've never said no, I never said no

Spiteful confrontations, trial separations
It's just another present to get past
The man was very helpful but I knew he wouldn't stay
There used to be a baby but the baby went away
Forswear what you undergo
You wanted to go alone though
I've never said no, I never said no
I've never said no, I never said no

It doesn't make me cry to hear Dylan say
"Most likely, you go your own way."
I'll go mine, I'll go mine
I'll go mine, I'll go mine

Forswear what you undergo
You wanted to go alone, though
I've never said no, I never said no
I've never said no, I never said noEmbed
