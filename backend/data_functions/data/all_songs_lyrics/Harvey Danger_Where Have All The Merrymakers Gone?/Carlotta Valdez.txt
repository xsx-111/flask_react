Carlotta Valdez Lyrics
Jimmy Stewart follows Kim to where your portrait hangs on a wall
You're such a haunting vision, he forgets his partner's fall
You jump into the San Francisco bay
I'll follow you in and I know you can't swim
When you've been dead a hundred years
Carlotta!

Carlotta Valdez, Carlotta Valdez
Carlotta Valdez, I will make you her

Everything's subjective
Nothing lasts for Johnny O
K-Kiss Kim Novak where the redwoods grow
Now bleach her hair and pretend that she didn't die
Go up the mission stairs, I'll follow anywhere
That is, until you climb too high 'cause I get
Oh, vertigo, vertigo, vertigo!

Carlotta Valdez, Carlotta Valdez
Carlotta Valdez, I will make you her

What a thing to be the center of attention all the time
He isn't really falling for this, is he?
He's getting dizzy and so am I!
Carlotta Valdez, Carlotta Valdez
Carlotta Valdez
Let her go, Jim!

Carlotta Valdez, Carlotta Valdez
Carlotta Valdez, I will make you her
(Yes!)1Embed
