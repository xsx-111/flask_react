Jack the Lion Lyrics
Rake up all the leaves in Pleasant Valley
It's the last day of my visit (upstate New York)
To pay respects to the old man
He's still got his sense of humor
Oh, but his body fails him
He's surrounded by loved ones
And that only goes so far
And does he know where he is?
I doubt it

Jack the lion roaring his last
Like a vision sent from the past
Bedside, crying, holding his hands
Strong hands
Whoa, whoa, oh

Finally get a moment alone with the old man
He's having trouble breathing
And he's not the only one, the only one
He wonders where time goes
And why we haven't spoken for so long
He regrets it
He forgets it
And none too soon
Because he's closing his eyes and fading
Jack the lion roaring his last
Like a vision sent from the past
Bedside, crying, holding his hands
Strong hands
Whoa, whoa, oh

We thank you for uniting
We thank you for the cause
We thank you for the lion
We thank you for the claws
Come see him again
Come see him again
Come see him again
Come see him again

Jack the lion roaring his last
Like a vision sent from the past
Bedside, crying, holding his hands
Strong hands

Jack the lion roaring his last
Jack the lion roaring his lastEmbed
