Old Hat Lyrics
Call me disruptive, say I break your concentration
Familiar patterns, like the waves that break too fast
What do you do when it's so brand new that it kills you?
Came on too strong, couldn't stand it slow
Now I know
She can knock me back like a champ

Disembodied ringlets from hair that look like yours
Call me the looming shapes of winter dusk impending

She barely fits inside my head, but I feel something
Every element but one is in my thrall
Stop traffic as I lie down in your footpath
Like a simile, I paint suggestive pictures of me and you

Disembodied ringlets from hair that looked like yours
Call me the looming shapes of winter dusk impending

Call me freaky
Call me childish
Call me Ishmael
Just call me back
Call me back
Call me back and I'll follow you around
I forget (I forget)
What my friends look like (what they look like)
And they forget why they like me (and they forget why they like me)
But that's old hat (it's old hat)
I'm so happy (I'm so happy)
How do you write about that?
How do you write about that?

Disembodied ringlets from hair that look like yours
Call me the looming shapes of winter dusk impending
Disembodied ringlets from hair that looked like yours
Call me the looming shapes of winter dusk impendingEmbed
