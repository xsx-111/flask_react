Terminal Annex Lyrics
Here's something beautiful
Now smash it to bits
Save your little wheelchair empowerment films
Save your swoons, I'm spoken for
It isn't pretty to think so
But I can't feign interest now

Dreaming of the fistfight I never got into
Thinking of the mean shit I wish I'd said to you
Such a fancy lady, call you Secretina
She didn't get all the good stuff
But she looked like you

Like a zero drowning in a sea of higher numbers
Everything you say to me is dumb
(at least it's stupid)

Twenty heavy hammers smashing down
Here's a doorstep you can never darken
You complain about an overflowing cup
Don't forget that I'm the one who filled that fucker up
(one, two, three)
Like a zero drowning in a sea of higher numbers
I remain as ever intrigued but no more astounded
Like a zero drowning in a sea of higher numbers
I think that I like you better when you just ignore me

So I sit and notice shadows growing
I think of how the clocks are slowing
Hoping hope's eternal flowing springs will do their thing
Do their thing, do their thing and save me from myself

Like a zero drowning in a sea of higher numbers
I remain as ever intrigued but no more astounded
Like a zero drowning in a sea of higher numbers
You want ego?
I will show you ego
I'm jealous nowEmbed
