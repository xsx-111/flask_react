Hey Moon Lyrics
I know it's been so long
Since we saw each other last
I'm sure we'll find some way
To make the time pass

Hey moon, it's just you and me tonight
Everyone else is asleep
Hey moon, if I was to fall
I won't fall so deep
Though I doubt I'm gonna
You can wake me up if you wanna

And your pale, round face
Makes me feel at home in any place
I would happen to be
At a quarter past three

The moon chased the sun out of the sky
Goodbye sun, the night's begun
The moon chased the sun out of the sky
Goodbye sunshine, the night is mine
Hey moon, it's just you and me tonight
Everyone else is asleep
Hey moon, if I was to fall
I won't fall so deep
Though I doubt I'm gonna
You can wake me up if you wanna
I would hate for you to hang there all alone
The whole night through

Hey moon, my old friend
Hey moon, the night is coming to an end
Hey moon, come back soon37Embed
