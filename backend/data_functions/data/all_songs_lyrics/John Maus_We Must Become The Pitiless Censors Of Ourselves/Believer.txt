Believer Lyrics
Telephone lines all across the world
People fight all across the world
Angels sing all across the world
Baby, you and me all across the world
Jackie Chan flashing all across the world
Hulk Hogan flashing all across the world
Baby, let's go fly all across the world
Baby, let's go fly all across the-

They call me the believer
And I'm not coming back
They call me the believer
And I'm not coming back

Telephone lines all across the world
People fight all across the world
Angels sing all across the world
Baby, you and me all across the world
Jackie Chan flashing all across the world
Hulk Hogan flashing all across the world
Baby, let's go fly all across the world
Baby, let's go fly all across the world
They call me the believer
And I'm not coming back
They call me the believer
And I'm not coming back2Embed
