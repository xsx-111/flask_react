Head for the Country LyricsThis is where a human being finds itself in the locker
This is where a human being finds itself in the locker
Somewhere, somewhere there’s a crime being committed
Somewhere, somewhere there’s a crime being committed
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
This is where a human being finds itself
This is where a human being finds itself
It finds itself, it finds itself
Somewhere, somewhere there’s a crime being committed
Somewhere, somewhere there’s a crime being committed
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)
Head for the country (Sitting alone in my box following orders)Embed
