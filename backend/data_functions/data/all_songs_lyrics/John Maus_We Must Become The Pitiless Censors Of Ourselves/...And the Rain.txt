...And the Rain Lyrics
Will somebody tell me the truth?
Will someone please tell me the truth?
Will somebody tell me the truth?

And the rain came down down down down
And the rain came down down down down
And the rain came down down down down down down

Will somebody tell me the truth?

It rains on everyone
It rains on everyone
It rains

And the rain came down down down down
And the rain came down down down down
And the rain came down down down down down down3Embed
