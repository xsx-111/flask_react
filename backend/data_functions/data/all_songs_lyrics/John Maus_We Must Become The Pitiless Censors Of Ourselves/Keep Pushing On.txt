Keep Pushing On Lyrics
Keep pushing on
Keep pushing on, keep pushing on
Keep pushing on keep pushing on
Keep pushing on, keep pushing on
Keep pushing on keep pushing on
Keep pushing on, keep pushing on
Keep pushing on keep pushing on
Keep pushing on, keep pushing on
Keep pushing on keep pushing on

Head for the rocking
City lights
When you go away
We're headed for nowhere
In our sights
When we go away
Head for the rocking
City lights
When you go away
We're headed for nowhere
In our sights
When we go away

Keep pushing on, keep pushing on
Keep pushing on keep pushing on
Keep pushing on, keep pushing on
Keep pushing on keep pushing on
Head for the rocking
City lights
When you go away
We're headed for nowhere
In our sights
When we go away
Head for the rocking
City lights
When you go away
We're headed for nowhere
In our sights
When we go away

Keep pushing on, keep pushing on
Keep pushing on keep pushing on
Keep pushing on, keep pushing on
Keep pushing on keep pushing on
Keep pushing on, keep pushing on
Keep pushing on keep pushing on
Keep pushing on, keep pushing on
Keep pushing on keep pushing on1Embed
