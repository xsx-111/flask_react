Hit of the Search Party LyricsNo man abandon his post
A gatecrasher has called us to arms
Take up your torch
I want this ship cleaner than a hospital ward
A radical has polluted our ranks
Slouch into position men, this is a war
Set the traps
We'll have that criminal's head
Marched through the streets on a stake
Someone will pay for this
We'll squeeze his goddamn brains out
Sleep with one knife open
You can't out-think us
We've been out of thoughts for a while
You can't out-think us
We've been out of thoughts for a while
And the warrior with the deadliest weapon
Is the one without an instruction manual for his gun
This is a union of dunces
We are the new global menace
Stalking the land
Gnashing dull teeth
Tapping our feet
Sighing and humming and watching the clock
That's what you get
That's what you get
That's what you get
That's what you get for fucking with us
That's what you get for fucking with us
When we find you
We'll skin you alive
We'll pluck out your eyes
And the cannons will roar as we march to the capitol
Dragging your hide
Drooling polished jackboot monsters
Tracking the scent of a sleeping child
Your composure gave you away
Next time it's best to cry havoc
Keep marching, the bridge is ours
They're coming to get me
They're coming to take me away
I'll never make love in this town again
Everyone on the dance floor is doomed
Hit the ground
Shut your mouth
The prisoners have laid waste to the pulpit
You're in for it now
Are these helicopters for me?
Have I been appointed to speak?
Then I'm going to Hell
And I'm taking the Renaissance with meEmbed
