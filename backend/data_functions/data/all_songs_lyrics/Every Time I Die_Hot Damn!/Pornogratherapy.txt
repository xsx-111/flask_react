Pornogratherapy LyricsTonight the cinema's the treatment clinic
Where the perverts seek the cure
Show me the rape scene one more time for the cause
And I promise we'll behave like perfect Christians
We'll sing the glory of the gospel
For some whiskey and a skin flick
Hallelujah (Rise, all rise)
Hallow be my name
(In this kingdom we come without calling)
Hallelujah
(The violence and the choir
The virgin and the fire
Up to her neck in tongues
Up to her neck in tongues)
Lovely, so lovely is Ludwig Van
Electronic sonata
Pumped through the mud of the one night stand
The saints in regalia whistling while they rape
Lid clamps in vitamins
Lift up her skirt
I'll be cured
Like a junkie with a methadone addiction thinks he's clean
I'll be cured
I'll be cured
Sit down and watch closely
All these whores have conceded the war
She said, "You might be sick, but you feel all right to me"
She said, "You might be sick, but you feel all right to me"
She said
She said
She said, "You might be sick, but you, aw, you feel all right to me"
That's enough
Turn if off
Well, I promise I'm better now
It's too much
Turn it off
Healed at the horror showEmbed
