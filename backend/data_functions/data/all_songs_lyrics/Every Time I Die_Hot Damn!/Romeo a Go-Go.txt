Romeo a Go-Go LyricsTonight I'm coming home
In a coma
If it fucking kills me
Listless but relieved
Beaming like a newborn hostage
Orphaned by an ambulance
I got this new black eye just for you
Your hopeless romantic
Now helplessly rheumatic
Poets grinding teeth to powder
All my vowels
Are getting lost in the gauze
Misinterpret courting
For the cursings of a drooling fool
Here's to cheap sex and codeine
In a hospital bed
And maybe I'd object
If I felt at all alive
Everybody's dying to lay down with you
I got the order all wrong
Maybe I bumped my head
Maybe I should quiet down
Don't bet on another blackout
I'll be all right
There's an army at my window
Waiting to lose this fight
I'm the king of this all night clinic
The fucking champion
Tonight we'll feast like royalty in traction
Happy and meticulous
There's a delicate love song in this
Kicked out and dripping in verse
Go get your gun
'Cause God won't show
He sent a poet instead
The Don Quixote of the ICU
Quite impressive
For a cripple
Munchhausen by Proxy of a muse
Tempt not a desperate man
Tempt not a desperate man
This split lip is for you
I traded it for an outdated toothEmbed
