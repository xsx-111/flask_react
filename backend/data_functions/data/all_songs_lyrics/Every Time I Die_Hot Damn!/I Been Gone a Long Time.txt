I Been Gone a Long Time LyricsWhat we're doing is so wrong
And what you're wearing is so right (It's so tight)
But I've never felt better
So I'm going out to get her
And I don't care, I don't care
What set of wheels I steal to get there
Balance is a minor setback
What she thinks is all right
And the way that she looks is just fine
She sure as hell ain't you
But Lord knows she'll have to do
She don't know I'm alive but neither do I
So there's nothing left to lose
If I could only make you, make you want to want me
One more drink, I think, should do
I wish that I could say
I love to watch you walk away
But you probably won't be back in time
To hear it
So it's just as well
No one out there gets back in alive
So I'll love the way you stand so close to a guy
Who we both know can't get near it
Strike when ready
Burn the highway
Strike when ready
Burn the highway
Strike when ready
Burn the highway
Strike when ready
Burn the highway down
Let me hear her high heels moan
I'm ready
I'm ready, set, go
There's cocaine in the key
That took us from the bar to her car to the bedroom
Only the lonesome love us
Only the careless can handle us
Only the lonesome love us
What's wrong
With us that we're so unamused?
Only the lonesome love us
Only the careless can handle us
Only the lonesome love us
What's wrong
With us that we're so unamused?
Only the lonesome love us
Only the careless can handle us
Only the lonesome love us
What's wrong
With us that we're so unamused?Embed
