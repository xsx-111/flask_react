Ebolarama LyricsBoys, shoot to thrill, from the hip
This time we put the "act" in action
We've tricked the pigs into thinking
That this auction is a pageant
In no time there will be makeup on our new set of cutlery
The livestock is star struck
They're all salivating like ravenous cartoons
Goddamn animal
You'd better watch where you spit
Squeal like soft music
If it helps, we'll dim the lights on the floor
Neon bulbs are the cosmetics of swine
Everybody looks quite dazzling
Trussed up in their formal attire
You'd make a great secret if I could keep you
But we all spill our guts
We're locked and loaded
Drip fed and bloated
Our trigger fingers snagged
In the mouse trap of the moment
Turn the lights off on us
Like a moth left in the cold
In the dark, begging for more
When the urgency strikes you
You'd better not lose your nerve
It's the rush that the cockroaches get
At the end of the world
It's alright, it's alright
There's a pail by the bed if you need one
But you're doing just fine
When in Rome we shall do as the Romans
When in Hell we do shots at the bar
Last call, k-k-kill it
Last call, k-k-kill it
Last call, k-k-kill it
Kill it, kill it
We don't think in terms of the morning afters
And we don't honor a single word of the night before
In the meantime we're just thoughtless
Incessant buzzing apparatus
Disillusioned and lonelier than the last man standing
It doesn't get any better than this
So run like Hell
So run like Hell
So run like Hell
This is a rock and roll takeover
Living each day one night at a time
There were mercy fucks, there was blood
Oh, you should have been there by my side
This is passion
This is red handed denial
I have no lover
And she hasn't the prettiest eyes
Last call, k-k-kill itEmbed
