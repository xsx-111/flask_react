Off Broadway LyricsThis isn't at all unpleasant
I'm enchanted by the lavish ballet
And I'll whistle the tune
All the way to the gallows
That I heard at the cabaret
At the sheriff's signal
The orchestra moves the floor
Don't it make you feel wonderful?
Body twisting strictly ballroom
Criminally elegant
Ideal pastured Viennese waltzer
I'm dressed to kill
I'm weightless and well rehearsed
In my godless opera my character is canonized
Unhand me
This is a musical and nothing goes wrong
Can't keep the classics
Out of the head of the masochists
Strike up the band
Strike up the band
It's 245 beats for a measure
Or five beats per six steps on alternating feet
The show must go on
Never mind the teeth and the fingernails
The show must go on
I don't feel at all like I thought I would
But I could probably go on like this forever
Tonight, we dance
For tomorrow they release the dogs
Tonight, we dance
For tomorrow they release the dogs
Tonight, we dance
For tomorrow they release the dogs
One, two, three, one, two, three
Keep it up
One, two, three
Savor it, savor it, savor it, savor it
Savor it, savor it, savor it, savor it
(Where is my head?)
Savor it, savor it, savor it, savor it
(Where is my heart?)
Savor it, savor it
Everything vanishesEmbed
