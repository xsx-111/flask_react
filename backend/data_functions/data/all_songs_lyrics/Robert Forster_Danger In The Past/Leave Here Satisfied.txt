Leave Here Satisfied LyricsFound myself in an empty house calling out is anyone there thinking someone must be here somewhere. No one stepped up at all, no one I could see no one tapped my shoulder and said "it's me."
I just wanted to run and hide
Felt a drop of water deep down inside
I could go but I wouldn't Leave Here Satisfied
A neighbour came in and said who are you. Me? I'm one of a million friends that can come when a party ends. He said they're gone - I asked him long. No he said "not long at all."
I just wanted to run and hide
Felt a drop of water deep down inside
I could go but I wouldn't Leave Here Satisfied
As I stood upon this place as sad as a gambler's face every impulse in me said Run. There was dust on the piano keys, dust on the backyard trees, dust on the doorlocks but not on me. The bookcase stood there and I really don't care that none of my books now stand there. Where are you now, where are you now. Where are you now my friend
I just wanted to run and hide
Felt a drop of water deep down inside
I could go but I wouldn't Leave Here Satisfied
Visitations hit me like a blast. If you put a detector to the past would it pick out the good bits that would last. I think so, and when you can let me know where you are and so. Leave Here SatisfiedEmbed
