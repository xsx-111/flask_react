Danger in the Past LyricsYour sister picked me up at the station
She told me they'd taken you in, the word was it was just observation
I thought here we go again
Danger in the Past
So I went and I saw you
We walked through the hospital grounds
I took your hand and I told you, never show your problems in a country town
Danger in the Past
We had friends
We had friends that didn't make twenty-five
I knew a genius in a bedroom who couldn't walk outside there have been some tremors in our lives
Danger in the Past
Your mother is a saint, with her goodwill and with her strength
I think that she thought that we were once lovers now she seems happier that we're friends
Danger in the Past
So you signed yourself out, with a cross and with a curse
You took my arm and you told me, that you knew some good people there in Perth
Danger in the Past
So I went back to my own city to find that I'd meade enemies while I was away
You might think this is a hard thing to do and it was your sister who used to say
