Dear Black Dream LyricsMy last and longest dream
Dear - Black - Dream
She asked me what it was
I said what does it mean
She said that it will be all right
She said you've just had a troubled night
I had this dream
In a strange black Northern hotel
I had this dream
And it felt like I'd been through Hell
She said do you have villains in your life
Well I guess I do
Are they vindictive and often cruel
I thought she must know them too
I had this dream
In a strange black Northern hotel
I had this dream
And it felt like I'd been through Hell
I dream of her in the colour Black
She dreams of me in the colour Red
Her red is soft and warm like cloth
My black is Dear - Black - Dream
My love and I sit in bed in the dark
My love and I sit in bed in the dark
Wondering who sings better in the dark
Is it Townes Van Zandt, or is it Guy Clark?Embed
