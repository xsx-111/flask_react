Justice LyricsI'm a lucky man
I'm a lucky man
The best is yet to come
The best is yet to come
To be in times like these
We are not hard to please
Don't ask me
How long I've been searching
Don't ask her
How long she's been waiting
To be in times like these
We are not hard to please
There's lace at the door
And a fire upstairs
There's smoke in the night
And someone who cares
To be in times like these
We are not hard to pleaseEmbed
