Heart Out to Tender LyricsPut yourself in my shoes
Look on down my line
She gets bigger in the mirror
I have to be with her this time
Heart out to tender
I came along with my bid
Saw her at the crossroads
Tell you what we did
Threw kisses of bridges on country roads
That's what we did
Heart out to tender
I came along with my bid
Someone gave me a curtain
Someone said they were lost
I knew I would never be free
Until that curtain was acrossEmbed
