Is This What You Call Change LyricsYou destroyed
What I
Adored
We should have
Kept it
It could have
Been restored
It
Could have been
Many things
Is This What You Call Change
Look at me
Not
The floor
I hate your taste
From the centre
To the shore
You stuck
A knife
In our side
Is This What You Call Change
As I breathe your deadly wind
As the oil in the river sends
Everything that's alive
To a painful end
I was
In the forest
It was
August
Come September
My whole world was
Sawdust
The poison
Is moving
Is This What You Call ChangeEmbed
