Baby Stones LyricsYou say, you want to take a lover
Although you're satisfied with me
We have to open our horizons, my love
We can, but you'll do it without me
You can call me old-fashioned
You can call me straight laced
I'm not going to sit here and let another man take my place
So go and see him, what will be will be
Every man for the rest of your life will be less than me
I want you to stay
You search for a worthwhile need
But why not do the searching around here and try to involve me?
You say there's nothing wrong with us
That what we have here is good
But you have more needs and the fire cannot burn on the same old wood
So excuse me if I look tired
So excuse me if I just look at the sun
You see I wanted to be blinded
And I wanted to be your only one
The yellow time of autumn comes
The dying sound of distant drums
The old me that sit on doorsteps know I am an unfortunate man
And on a road that's made of stones
The road that's made of Baby Stones
There's an arrow made of stones
That points away from this home
I missed the turning back, I walked on by
Old situations can make you want to lie down and die
I want you to stay
You search for a worthwhile need
But why not do the searching around here and try to involve me?
And on a road that's made of stones
The road that's made of Baby Stones
There's an arrow made of stones
That points away from this homeEmbed
