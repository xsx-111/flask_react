Sundown (Back in the Briars) Lyrics
There go the cops with the tomcat teeth
Here come the church mice trying too hard
She had a way to be kind with words
I had a knife in the back of my car

Nobody knows when the rain may come
Nobody wants to wake up and be cruel
She locked the door and the sun went down
In South Carolina with nothing to lose

All of her naked boys (Ooh, ooh)
And not even I was trueEmbed
