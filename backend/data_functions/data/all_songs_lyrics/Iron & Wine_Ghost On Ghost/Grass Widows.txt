Grass Widows Lyrics
We found each other blown between the trees
Where the moons want me to be swallowed by the sea
Like we finally saw the colors of the world
We grew the garden snake within the weeds
Laid each other long across a flat back street
Like we finally saw the colors of the world

We felt the sun leave us for the west
And the lips always folding farther from the breast
Like we finally saw the colors of the world
We ran a white flag up the mast
Puckered up like a widow gleaming in the grass
Like we finally saw the colors of the world

Like we saw black, like we saw black and blue
You placed up in the foolish snow up, cover loose
Like we saw black, like we saw brown, green, too
You saw it often but it's over too soon

Like we saw black, running a million times
I found you in the fundamental with the mind
Like we saw black, lyin' in gold and white
I love this song and 'til you love me all night
We threw our money to the river stones
Led each other to the woods to wander back alone
Like we finally saw the colors of the world
We let the taste linger in the mouth
South Chicago never gave us more to sing about
Like we finally saw the colors of the worldEmbed
