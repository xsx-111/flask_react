Joy Lyrics
Deep inside the heart of this troubled man
There's itty bitty boy tuggin' hard at your hand
Born bitter as a lemon, but you must understand
That you've been bringin' me joy
And I only lie when you don't want the truth
I'm only frightened cause you finally gave me somethin' to lose
And it's as loud as a thunderclap and you hear it too
But you've been bringin' me joy

La la la, ooh, lala lala la, la, lala, la, nah nah

Deep inside the heart of this crazy mess
I'm only calm when I get lost within your wilderness
Born crooked as a creek bed, I've come to confess
That you've been bringin' me joy
Well I'm in love, I'm livin' for you
When all the bluebirds dyin' but they're singin' the blues
It's a heartfelt silly sort of bumblin' tune
But how you're bringin' me joy

La la la, ooh, lala lala la, la, lala, la, nah nah
