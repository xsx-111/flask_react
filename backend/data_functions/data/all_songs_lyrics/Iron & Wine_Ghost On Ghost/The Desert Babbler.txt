The Desert Babbler Lyrics
It's New Year's Eve
California's gonna kill you soon
The Barstow boys
Buckeyes in the shadow of the moon
Black houses in the hills and road side hearts
Dying for a place to fall apart
Who knew that you could learn to live without?
Mother Mary's lyin' in your mouth now

Back home the kitchen's warm with Christmas wine
And every girl has got an axe to grind
You live to look for heaven, but you're far
From the hard light tonight
(ooh, baba dap ba ba ba ba bada)
(ooh, baba dap ba ba ba ba bada)

So quietly we've lost another year
The desert put a babbler in your ear
Mean fireweed and I miss you again
Barstow boys are spit into the wind, now
Back home the hammer always has to fall
Crosses barely hanging on the wall
Someday I know you'll never leave me
But we're far from the hard light tonight
(aah, baba dap ba ba ba ba bada) Ohh
(aah, baba dap ba ba ba ba bada) Ohh
(aah, baba dap ba ba ba ba bada) Ohh
(aah, baba dap ba ba ba ba bada)2Embed
