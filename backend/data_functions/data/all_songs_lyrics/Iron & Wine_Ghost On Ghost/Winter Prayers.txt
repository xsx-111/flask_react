Winter Prayers Lyrics
Well it's cold, and you're bored
From countin' the Smart cars on 94
When you dream you're back home
But the lakeside don't trust you to walk alone
Hollow trees talk off-hand
All the neckties are toastin' with empty cans
And you know why she's gone
By the clothes in the river, driftin' on

Slide down south
'Cause once in a while, your confidence leaves you
Like smoke falls out her red mouth
(Aah, ooh, aah, ooh)
(Aah, ooh, aah, ooh)

Well she left you the holes
The tracks in the backyard, December snow
But those sad souvenirs
They end at the fence line, disappear
Why you'd follow her there?
Milwaukee's a deaf ear for winter prayers
There's no night, there's no day
With only hope in your pocket, and hell to pay
Slide down south
When once in a while your confidence leaves you
Like smoke falls out her red mouth
(Aah, ooh, aah, ooh)
(Aah, ooh, aah, ooh)
(Aah, ooh, aah, ooh)
(Aah, ooh, aah, ooh)Embed
