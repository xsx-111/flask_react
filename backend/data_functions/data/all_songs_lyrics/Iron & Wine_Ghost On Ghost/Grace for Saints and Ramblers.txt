Grace for Saints and Ramblers Lyrics
But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)
But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)

There were banged up pens, stealing first base
Underneath the tables so we never say grace
Falling out of bed for the workday week
There was kissin' in the cracks of the flash flood street
There were buddin' blossoms, blarin' Johnny Rotten
Chewed up and swallowed
By the prophet they were tryin' to follow
Bit too green and we paid no tax on our quick romantic cul-de-sac

But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)
But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)

There were crashed out cars in our bark-old clothes
They were rubbin' on each other, rubbin' ghost on ghost
There were junked-up punks and Jesus freaks
Weavin' in and out of trouble, wrappin' 'round and 'round a leash
There were sleepless dreamers, blues day preachers
The message and the messenger, the gun beneath the register
The sweet gum tree by the dug drop tank
We could never give enough to the bad-luck bank
There were hopeless sinners, sweepstake winners
They danced with the farmer’s daughter
Capered with the corporate lawyers

But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)
But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)
But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)
And it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)

There was laughing in the night, sugar in the shade
There were backstab handshakes made on faith
We were never out of time and were never entertained
Anybody said the habit of the wind was going to change
There were misled misfits, teethin' biscuits
Volumes full of penny wishes, parties full of pretty dishes
Side by side with the birds and bees
And we never sang grace and never ever took a knee
With the saints and ramblers, movie star handlers
High above the aviary, underneath the cemetery

And we never wondered why, ‘cause the sun was in our eyes
There was seed for the field, there was grease for the wheel
We were drinkin' with the luminaries, eatin' with the visionaries
But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)
But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)
But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)
But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)

But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)
But it all came down to you and I (down to you and I)
But it all came down to you and I1Embed
