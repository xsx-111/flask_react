Baby Center Stage Lyrics
Mama called you Baby Center Stage
She could really run her mouth
Baton Rouge called you Petit Ange
And Birmingham had run you out

Doesn't anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time I was runnin' you down
But the world kept spinnin' 'round
Doesn't anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time when you were runnin' to me
But the lightnin' spared the tall tree

When your moon lights up the riverside
Makin' mud and bad blood
You can call me anytime
For all it's worth, Louisiana's still not enough

In your restless days
I got lost, I got saved
In your restless nights
I swum blind, somehow fallin' into the light
Doesn't anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time I was runnin' you down
But the world kept spinnin' 'round
Doesn't anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time when you were runnin' to me
But the hurricane had mercy

In your restless days
All that wind, all those waves
In your restless nights
We closed our eyes, killed each other and came to life
In your restless days
I made my bed, I dug my grave
In your restless nights
We both swum blind, somehow fallin' into the lightEmbed
