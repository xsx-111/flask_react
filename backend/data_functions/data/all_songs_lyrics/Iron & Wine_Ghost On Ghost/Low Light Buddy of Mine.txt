Low Light Buddy of Mine Lyrics
He's in a white car waiting for the light to change
He's a buddy of mine but I can't complain
He can make a lot of money, he can touch his toes
He knows you never look 'til the lights are low

But I love you and you love me
So we never demand and we never agree
I love you and you love me
And there's new fruit hummin' in the old fruit trees

He's in a white car waiting in a parking lot
And he's jealous of me and what we've got
He can buckle his belt, he can shine his shoe
But he can never end up where I found you

And I love you and you love me
So we don't talk back and we don't say please
I love you and you love me
And there's new fruit hummin' in the old fruit trees

He's in a white car waiting for the rain to pass
He's a buddy of mine but that won't last
'Cause he ain't the dumb grin on an empty cup
We both took him for when he showed up
'Cause I love you and you love me
So we both get stuck and we both get free
I love you and you love me
And there's new fruit hummin' in the old fruit treesEmbed
