Caught in the Briars Lyrics
Back alleys full of rain
And everything shining
As holy as she can be
The trick’s in the timing
Free as a morning bird
Fragile as china
She’s stuck in the weakest heart
Of South Carolina

Where all of the naked boys
Lay down beside her
Sing her the saddest song
All caught in the briars

I never meant to fall
So hard in the doorway
And all the sinners here
Have crosses for Sunday
Kissed at the county fair
Frisked in the city
Which proves as an answered prayer
But ain’t it a pity
Where all of the naked boys
Lay down beside her
Sing her the saddest song
All caught in the briarsEmbed
