Unfortunately, Anna LyricsFound her walking in the rain
Down on Fatherland Street
I call her name she stops and she smiles and she turns to me
I say, "Darling where you been?"
She says, "You know, daddy, I've been looking for you."
She pops the rear door open and slides into my rear view
She puts her arms around me. And I put her into gear
I say, "Where you want to go?"
She says, "I don't know, just anywhere but here
Cause I'm tired of walking down the same old streets every night
I'm tired of the same old faces, the same old sunrise
And I wonder how my Mama's doing in Memphis
I wonder how my kids are up in Michigan
So please, baby, just drive
Carry me out into the night
Carry me out into the night
Cause I need to know, that there is something more to this life
That there is something more to this moment, than this poor town can provide
I feel the pressure. I feel it pushing down on me. I feel like I'm about to scream
I'm feeling low and downright mean
So please, baby just drive
Please, baby, just drive"
I wish there was something that I could do
But baby, you've gone too far to come back home
And all these years you've been waiting for the world to change
But unfortunately, Anna
Unfortunately, Anna, it's you, who needs to change
Unfortunately, Anna
Found her walking in the rain down on Fatherland Street
I call her name and she stops and she smiles and she turns to me
She turns to me
She turns to meEmbed
