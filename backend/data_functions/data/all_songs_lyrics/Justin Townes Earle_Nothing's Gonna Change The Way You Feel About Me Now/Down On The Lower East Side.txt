Down On The Lower East Side Lyrics
Well the midnight's on Manhattan 11th street and all alone
Countin' cracks beneath my feet cause my head is hanging low
And the street lights all down be shining on the falling rain
Shadows dance across the street
Wind seems to whisper her name

But in this tired old town another sleepless night
Keep me wandering around down on the lower east side

So lay a star up in heaven shining down from up above
And the city is unforgiving when you got nobody to love

But it's more and more these days I find I need a place to hide
And it's easy to get away when you're down on the lower east side
Yeah it's easy to get away when you're down on the lower east sideEmbed
