Look the Other Way Lyrics
Mama, I'm hurting, in the worst way
I got no money in my pocket, no place to stay
And when I see you out in the streets
Never know what to say
Aw, but it doesn't matter, mama
If you always look the other way

Mama, I'm searching every night and day, oh
I'm looking for the means to pay
For all the wrongs that I've done
For the nights I've let you long awake
Aw, but I'm always gonna owe you
If you always look the other way


I've been a fool, I know
I'm trying to find a way to show you
That you're the only one that
The only one I'll ever want

So I'm learning, learning to be a better man
I'm not certain, but I think I can now
Oh, but if I fall short, just know
I've done all I can do to change
But you're never gonna notice
If you always look the other way
Mama, you're never gonna notice
If you always look the other wayEmbed
