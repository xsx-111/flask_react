Maria LyricsUsed to be I was the object of affection
In your eyes alone
But now it seems your heart has found a new direction
You’re leavin’ me out in the cold
So if you’re gonna break my heart go on and break it
No I don’t don’t need you no more
Well I tried so hard and now my will is breakin’
Baby even more I still love you
I remember when you used to make me happy
Just to look into your eyes
But now every time I try you’re lookin’ past me
And I don’t know why
So baby you don’t even gotta tell me no I already know
So don’t even say goodbye just walk on past me
I don’t want to hurt no more
Not for you Maria
Any way I turn I could find a better way to lose
Ah Maria
I guess mama wasn’t lyin’ about the dangers
There could be inside ones heart
We’re better off if we all remain strangers
Stumblin’ thru the dark
Ah MariaEmbed
