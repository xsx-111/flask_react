Lesson in Survival Lyrics
Lesson in survival
Spinning out on turns, that gets you tough
Guru books, the Bible
Only a reminder that you're just not good enough
You need to believe in something
Once I could in our love

Black road, double yellow line
Friends and kin, campers in the kitchen, that's fine sometimes
But I know my needs, my sweet tumbleweed
I need more quiet times
By a river flowing, you and me
Deep kisses and the sun going down

Maybe it's paranoia, maybe it's sensitivity
Your friends protect you, scrutinize me, I get so damn timid
Not at all the spirit that's inside of me
Oh baby, I can't seem to make it with you socially
There's this reef around me

I'm looking way out at the ocean
Love to see that green water in motion
I'm going to get a boat
And we can row it if you ever get the notion
To be needed by me
Fresh salmon frying and the tide rolling in
I went to see a friend tonight, was very late when I walked in
My talking as it rambled revealed suspicious reasoning
The visit seemed to darken him
I came in as bright as a neon light
And I burned out right there before him

I told him these things I'm telling you now
Watched them buckle up in his brow
When you dig down deep, you lose good sleep
And it makes you heavy company
I will always love you, hands alike
Magnet and iron, the soulsEmbed
