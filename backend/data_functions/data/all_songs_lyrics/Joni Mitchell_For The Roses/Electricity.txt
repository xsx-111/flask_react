Electricity Lyrics
The minus is loveless, he talks to the land
And the leaves fall and the pond over-ices
She don't know the system, plus she don't understand
She's got all the wrong fuses and splices
She's not going to fix it up too easy

The masking tape tangles, it's sticky and black
And the copper proud-headed Queen Lizzie
Conducts little charges that don't get charged back
Well, the technical manual's busy
She's not going to fix it up too easy

And she holds out her flashlight and she shines it on me
She wants me to tell her what the trouble might be
Well I'm learning it's peaceful with a good dog and some trees
Out of touch with the breakdown of this century
They're not going to fix it up too easy

We once loved-together and we floodlit that time
Input-output-electricity
But the lines overloaded and the sparks started flying
And the loose wires were lashing out at me
She's not going to fix that up too easy
But she holds out her candle and she shines it in
And she begs him to show her how to fix it again
While the song that he sang her to soothe her to sleep
Runs all through her circuits like a heartbeat
She's not going to fix it up too easyEmbed
