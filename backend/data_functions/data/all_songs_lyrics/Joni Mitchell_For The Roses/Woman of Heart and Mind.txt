Woman of Heart and Mind Lyrics
I am a woman of heart and mind
With time on her hands, no child to raise
You come to me like a little boy
And I give you my scorn and my praise

You think I'm like your mother
Or another lover or your sister
Or the queen of your dreams
Or just another silly girl when love makes a fool of me

After the rush when you come back down
You're always disappointed, nothing seems to keep you high
Drive your bargains. push your papers, win your medals, fuck your strangers
Don't it leave you on the empty side?

I'm looking for affection and respect, a little passion
And you want stimulation, nothing more, that's what I think
But you know I'll try to be there for you
When your spirits start to sink

All this talk about holiness now
It must be the start of the latest style
Is it all books and words or do you really feel it?
Do you really laugh, do you really care, do you really smile when you smile?
You criticize and you flatter
You imitate the best and the rest you memorize
You know the times you impress me most
Are the times when you don't try
When you don't even tryEmbed
