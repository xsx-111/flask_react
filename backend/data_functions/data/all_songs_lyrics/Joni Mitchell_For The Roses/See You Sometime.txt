See You Sometime Lyrics
Where are you now
Are you in some hotel room, does it have a view?
Are you caught in a crowd
Or holding some honey who came on to you?

Why do you have to be so jive?
Okay, hang up the phone, it hurts
But something survives though it's undermined
I'd still like to see you sometime

I'm feeling so good
And my friends all tell me that I'm looking fine
I run in the woods
I spring from the boulders like a mama lion

I'm not ready to change my name again
But you know I'm not after a piece of your fortune and your fame
'Cause I've tasted mine
I'd just like to see you sometime

Pack your suspenders
I'll come meet your plane
No need to surrender
I just want to see you again
We're in for more rain
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees
It seems such a shame
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly

I couldn't take them all on then
With a headful of questions and hypes
So when the hopes got so slim, I just resigned
But I'd still like to see you sometime
I'd sure like to see youEmbed
