Blonde in the Bleachers Lyrics
The blonde in the bleachers, she flips her hair for you
Above the loudspeakers, you start to fall
She follows you home but you miss living alone
You can still hear sweet mysteries calling you
The bands and the roadies lovin' 'em and leavin' 'em
It's pleasure to try 'em, it's trouble to keep 'em

'Cause it seems like you've gotta give up
Such a piece of your soul when you give up the chase
Feeling it hot and cold, you're in rock 'n' roll
It's the nature of the race
It's the unknown child, so sweet and wild
It's youth, it's too good to waste

She tapes her regrets to the microphone stand
She says, "You can't hold the hand of a rock 'n' roll man very long
Or count on your plans with a rock 'n' roll man very long
Compete with the fans for your rock 'n' roll man for very long
The girls and the bands and the rock 'n' roll man"Embed
