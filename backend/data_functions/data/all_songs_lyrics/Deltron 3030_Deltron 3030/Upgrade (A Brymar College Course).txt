Upgrade (A Brymar College Course) Lyrics
Here at Brynmar College
We can get you prepared for the 31st century
With advanced programming and quad rendering
And Java plus plus plus scripting language
We offer advanced job placement assistance
So upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Comin' from the outer regions of the universe
Deltron Zero and Automator
Check it

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

Hey time for you to upgrade, fuck save, time to load
All my rhymes the soul, and find your own
Salivate over what I collaborate, with high tech wizardry
And breathe new life into the industry
Save to the hard drive, for the archives
Three thousand thirty, with a global apartheid
Sensitivity ain't the energy, brain chemically contorted
With no coordinates, to your ordinance
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

Yo, your recovery's slow
My dual input, plus my modem, the tools in foot
Long songs instrumental digital projector professor
I'll school you on the art and how it's texture mapped
Get your act together, my style is mega
Educate the heads of eight lonely beggars
Only shred of evidence is the virtual file
Stored within the cerebellum, hit you Berkowitz style

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

My defense capabilities, with ape agility
Take possibilities to the point of sense and shatter it
Commence the babbling, I'm meditatin' on a homosapien
With no education I'm 3D acceleration
My programmin' language, is the strangest
To come to grips, with mechanized mischief
Kicks it off with circular projectiles, X-Files
Heralded, as the most important dwarf the corporates
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

Hey, I reduce the game, when I boost my brain
What you used to sayin', I loosen the frame
With shock announcements, t-minus and countin'
Effects control and bouncin', star studded and flooded
Like fountains, a new machine
Real artists are few between, you better lube your screen
My renders are splendor, three-sixty
Reflecting quickly, increase your disk speed
So you can

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

My production model is the stuff to boggle minds
You got a log-on time of exactly thirty-six nanoseconds
Amb-i-dex-tri-ous with ambience
Watch the cannons twist while I lockout my hardware
Word warfare logistically locate and process
With psychotropics to optimize my profits
Envelop you with development kits that help me
To embellish the elements dynamic and too intelligent
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

Lookie here
As soon as I release the chip, you cease to rip
Synopsis, you want to top this? Reach to it
Digital retouch, reconstruct a whole conglomerate
With our armaments we use with tolerance
Such as a G-Bomb, cyborg with 3 arms
Translate the ancient language with a brain dish
Micro machines polystrene conducting electrons
Deltron strengthen with molecular bonds

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
