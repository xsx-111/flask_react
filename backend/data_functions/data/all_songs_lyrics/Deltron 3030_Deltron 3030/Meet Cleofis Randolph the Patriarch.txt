Meet Cleofis Randolph the Patriarch Lyrics
What's happening?
I keep my dreadlocks in a napkin ring
Rap and sing, unlike the homogeneous clones
I'm into earth tones, birth stones, and erogenous zones
The more ticklish the more you have
Sitting on the curb over what used to be the 'burbs
And before that was Canarsie
I'm a disturbed and bitter herb;
Like saltwater and parsley
Mites crawl up, tights fall down
That's my mnemonic for a stalactite slash stalagmite
You may have this MagliteÂ®
It survived the apocalypse
And for the fragile force of an agile horse
Here's a handful of very special chocolate chipsEmbed
