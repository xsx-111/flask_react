Starlust LyricsWalking at midnight in the darkness, alone
Standing in the shadows and I'm watching your glow
Standing in the red light and I'm smiling at you
Dreaming of the starlight just waiting for you

I'll do anything to make you mine, make me shine
Take me if you want me, I don't care, I don't mind
I want your starlight, make it mine, make me shine
Touch me with your light and I'll burn like a starEmbed
