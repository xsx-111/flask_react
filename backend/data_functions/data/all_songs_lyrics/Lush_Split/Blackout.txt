Blackout Lyrics
I'm not interested in what you have to say
You're just a vacant space
Other people's lives upon which you prey
It's a permanent disgrace
Why do you think you know what's best for me
What I should and shouldn't do
Why do you judge my history
And tell me to improve

In the confines of your mind
You think we're all the same
I've left them all behind
Though you wish I hadn't

In finding fault in others I can't see
What you have to gain
I know that you get pleasure from
Other people's pain
You're not so perfect and I realise the scene
That you're all coming from
When you say you care I know what you mean
You're really lying
All the people around here
Love to hear about a fall
They all surface and disappear
In an instant

In the confines of your mind
You think we're all the same
I've left them all behind
Through you wish I hadn'tEmbed
