Light from a Dead Star Lyrics
He lives his life in a world
Full of women and he takes
What he wants from their love
And he throws the rest away
I cling to him and pray
But still, he slips away
And now it's just too late
To wish him back again

She won't put up with this life
So she leaves him and she finds
Someone else, falls in love
And she travels far away
I say that it's okay
And swallow all my pain
And now it's just too late
To wish her back again

They left me here on my own
In a nightmare and I just
Can't forgive any more
So I smile and I turn away
Don't listen when they say
They wish that I could stay
And now it's just too late
To wish me back againEmbed
