When I Die Lyrics
If you walked in now
I wouldn't start I wouldn't frown
And if you just appeared
I wouldn't cry or think it weird

'Cause you are still around
You're in the air, you're in the ground
And you can't go away
I am afraid you're here to stay

Friends don't understand
They close the door, they raise their hands
She says she heard your voice
Of course she does, she has no choice

I was hours ahead
When they removed you from your bed
They drank all the while
Until you said goodbye

Why are we sitting here in ourselves?
Why are we sitting here in ourselves?
Why are we sitting here in ourselves?
I don't look up, I don't look down
I look ahead and make no sound
My love was there
I only stare

Healthy in my dreams
Is what you are, is what is seems
What does it all mean?
You're only hiding behind a screen

Curse the English day
For what it forces us to say
Banish all the pain
'Cause when I die, die
I'll see you againEmbed
