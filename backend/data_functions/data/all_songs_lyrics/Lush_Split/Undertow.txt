Undertow Lyrics
So you want to be alone
Run and hide inside your home
Watch you fall away from me, sinking into misery

Taste your smile and hold my hand
Make you laugh and make you dance
I remember this, everything was in our kiss

Sink my hands into the sea (Sink my hands into the sea)
Reach your fingers up to me (Reach your fingers up to me)
Trust me one more time, I can only try
Throw yourself to me and I'll try to pull you free

Let me try to pull you free, let me try to pull you free
Let me try to pull you free, let me try to pull you free
Let me try to pull you free, let me try to pull you free
Let me try to pull you free, let me try to pull you free
Let me try to pull you free, let me try to pull you free
Let me try to pull you free, let me try to pull you free1Embed
