Lovelife LyricsYou are the one
In your concrete arms, I adore you
Dirty and dear
Block out the sun
In your twists and turns, I invade
You show me no fear
We blow around like tiny leaves
In a big storm
Finding there's nothing left to breathe
Or to keep warm
You ebb and flow
And your rhythm beats my head
Leave me alone
While you swallow up your dead
You are the one
You cradle me and kill, caressing my face
Leave me undone
You suffocate and have me, this is the place
Every door conceals a dream
And a nightmare
Nothing is ever really pure
In the stale air
And when it's dark
Everything becomes more clear
Lie in the park
When I want to have you near
You are the one
In your concrete arms, I adore you
Dusty and dear
Block out the sun
In your twists and turns, I invade
You show me no fear
Left it unsung
I shall leave but I'll return
Poison my lungs
My blood is full of lead
Things unsaid
My love for you still burnsEmbed
