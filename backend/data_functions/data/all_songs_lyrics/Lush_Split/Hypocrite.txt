Hypocrite Lyrics
Silly girl, I run around
And never know my reasons
And though you're laughing with me
I know what you say about me
I can't explain
It's not your business anyway
So don't say you understand
And don't pretend you're on my side
And I remember when you
Hated her for sleeping next to him
I see your smiling face but
I know you've done worse to me

You hypocrite
Don't talk to me 'cause you're not fit to know me
So don't pretend
That you could've ever been a friend

And still, I'm sure
You think it's okay
What you've done to me
'Cause I'm so bad to him
Don't even try to hide
Behind that stupid lie
I know your kind
And I know where your loyalties lie
Silly girls, we run around
And never know our reasons
And though I understand
I guess I say that you betrayed me

I'm a hypocrite
I dish it out but I can't take it
I know you think it's wrong
And maybe you're right but this is my song

And still, I'm sure
You think that it's okay
What she did to me
'Cause I'm so bad to him
Don't even try to hide
Behind that stupid smile
I know our kind
And I know where our loyalties lie1Embed
