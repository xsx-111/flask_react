Lit Up LyricsYou feel like I do
Like the whole world's forgotten you
And your life is so dull
And predictable
Your room seems like a cell
And you don't sleep very well
And your friends only talk
To point and to mock
And to ridicule
One day, things won't seem the same way, I know
Morning in the mirror
Things will suddenly seem much clearer
I promise, it's alright
His words don't flatter me
And they're printed for all to see
I don't care, he's not there
It's all history
The future's yours to hold
And you're really not very old
And your life is so white
So clean and so bright
And holds mystery
Morning in the mirror
Things will suddenly seem much clearer
I promise it's alright
One day, things won't seem the same way, I know
One day, things won't seem the same way, I know
One day, things won't seem the same way, I knowEmbed
