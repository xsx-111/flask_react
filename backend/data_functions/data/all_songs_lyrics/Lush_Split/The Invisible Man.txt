The Invisible Man Lyrics
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Outside you are
Waiting for me, hiding
You catch me when I am
Needing a friend to hold
You can soothe me
Lie above me, press hard
Then you strike and I think
That I'll die 'cause I can't breathe
Can't breathe

Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Please let me start screaming
Eyes are open seeing nothing
Hands are tied and I can't function
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screamingEmbed
