American Horse LyricsOoh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, well, well, well
Stick it in your ear
'Cause it ain't exactly clear
What you people hear
I tell you that's right, oh yeah
Sucker in the middle
Blowing hot and cold
Cracking his whip
On the American horse
He's gone crazy, completely crazy
Trying to tame the American horse, well
He's gone crazy, completely crazy
Trying to tame the American horse, well
Feather in his mane
Showing no fear
Of a twisted shady fool
I tell you that's right, ah-ha, that's right
Truth's a mighty clear
Forever on and on
Never break the spirit
Of the American horse, well
Don't you shoot him down
He's gone crazy, completely crazy
Trying to tame the American horse
He's gone crazy, completely crazy
Trying to tame the American horse, yeah
He's gone crazy, completely crazy
Trying to tame the American horse
He's gone crazy, completely crazy
Trying to tame the American horse, yeah yeah yeah
Crazy
On the day they tried to tame the American horse, yeah
Crazy
On the day they tried to tame the American horse, ow
Riding on a pony
Riding against the wind
And in came Brando
And he told it like thisEmbed
