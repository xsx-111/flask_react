Soul Asylum LyricsWho would break a butterfly on a wheel?
Not me, my precious child
Sweet angel, wrap me in your velvet cloak, my dear
Love's a sweet warm goddess I invited here
So many times I call your name, ooh baby, baby, please
So many times I call your name, ooh yeah
Before the night is through
Grant me one last wish
Sweet soul asylum, yeah
An everlasting kiss
Who would crush this woman underfoot?
Ooh, not me, my chosen one
(My chosen one)
Sweet angel, wrap me in your velvet cloak, my dear
Love's a sweet warm goddess I invited here
So many times I call your name, oh please, baby, yeah
So many times I call your name
Before the night is through
Grant me one last wish
Sweet soul asylum, yeah
An everlasting kiss
Oh, ooh baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh oh
Takes me far away
So many times I call your name, oh baby, baby, please
So many times I call your name
(Before the night is through)
Before the night is through
(Grant me one last wish)
Oh, grant me one last wish
Sweet soul asylum, yeah
An everlasting kiss
(Before the night is through)
(Grant me one last wish)
Sweet soul asylum, yeah
An everlasting kiss
Sweet soul asylum, yeah
Oh, sweet soul asylum
Sweet soul, yeah
Sweet soul asylum, ohEmbed
