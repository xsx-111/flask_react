Soldier Blue LyricsYeah, come on now
Soldier blue, bloodstained red
Hey people, he's gonna bust your head
A real bad dream, yeah, you know it's true
Kiss his boots or you'll be through
Out of the night comes a soldier right
Line you up in his gunsight
His mind's exploded, ego's overloaded
Hey children, start-a-runnin'
Soldier blue, love is out of season
Soldier blue, yeah, ain't fighting for no reason, no, no
Ain't fighting for no reason, no, no
Well, soldier blue, soldier fright
He's gonna bust up everything in sight
A real heavy dude in a killing mood
Pack your bags or you'll be through, you'll be through, yeah
He's guaranteed to shatter all your dreams
His mind's exploded, ego's overloaded
Hey children, start-a-runnin', yeah
Soldier blue, oh, love is out of season
Soldier blue, ain't fighting for no reason
Soldier blue, yeah, love is out of season
Soldier blue, yeah, her love is out of season
I have seen the sunset, the sea on fire
Ships burn off the coast of Orion
Dreams of peace wait on the horizon, oh yeah
Clouds filled with blood rain on the water
While nighttime's fingers clench the light shut
Our sister rides the horse, Apocalypse
Now is the closing
Love has no season, yeah
Love has no season
C'mon shake ya sinner
Soldier blue, love is out of season
Soldier blue, ain't fighting for no reason
Soldier blue, yeah, love is out of season
Soldier blue, fighting for no reason
Soldier blue, fighting for no reason, yeah
Soldier blue, fighting for no reason, yeah
Love has no season
Love has no season
Love has no season, yeahEmbed
