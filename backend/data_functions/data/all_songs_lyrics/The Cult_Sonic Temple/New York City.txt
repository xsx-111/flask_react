New York City LyricsI saw a rainbow stretched across the ocean
Crashed the Big Apple
So I took a bite
Found a taste I like
But she bit me back
I jumped across the ocean
Found a Big Apple
So I took a bite
She teased me with a taste
Laid my soul to waste
Stabbed me in the back
Hell's Kitchen is a DMZ
I ain't never coming back, no
Hell's Kitchen is a DMZ
I ain't never coming back, child
Pressure never stops
Pressure never drops
Lennon got fried
Said it was a crime
Said it was a pity
No one even cried
Pressure never stops
Pressure never drops
Lennon got fried
Said it was a crime
Said it was a pity
No one even cried, cried, cried
Oh, Hell's Kitchen is a crazy place
I ain't never coming back, oh no no
Hell's Kitchen is a crazy place
I ain't never coming back
Oh, New York City
Oh, New York City, yeah, yeah
New York City, yeah
Oh, New York City, well, well
Hell's Kitchen is a DMZ
I'm never coming back, no
Disneyland, trash can baby, yeah
It'll give you a heart attack
The Times Square shuffle, Manhattan flip
Twenty four hour groove
Working up a frenzy baby
People push on through, yeah
Listen boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I jumped across the ocean
Found a Big Apple
So I took a bite
She teased me with a taste
Laid my soul to waste
Stabbed me in the back
Hell's Kitchen is a crazy place
I'm never coming back, no no no
Hell's Kitchen is a DMZ
I ain't never, never, yeah
Oh, New York City
Wake up, yeah, in the New York City
Well, New York City, yeah, yeah
New York City
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shake it up, do it now
Shake it up, bells ringing
I'm shooting on the hip now
I'm shooting on the hip now, baby
I'm shooting on the hip now
Oh, New York CityEmbed
