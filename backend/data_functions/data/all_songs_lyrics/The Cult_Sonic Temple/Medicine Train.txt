Medicine Train LyricsShotgun
Standing on a stage, the boy started shaking
Lip curled back, place started quaking, yeah
I ain't got long to go now, baby
I'm flying high
Riding on a medicine train (train)
Never coming down again, no (train)
Riding on a medicine train (train)
I ain't never, never coming down
All fired up, a desolation angel
Shooting from a hip in the sonic temple, yeah
I ain't got long to go now, baby
Cause I'm flying high
Riding on a medicine train (train)
Never coming down again, no (train)
Riding on a medicine train, yeah (train)
I ain't never coming down again, well (train)
Riding on a medicine train (train)
Never coming down again (train)
Riding on a medicine train, train, train, train (train)
I ain't never, yeah
Shotgun
Ah, don't you take me down the river, please
Ah, don't you take me down the river, please, please, please
Standing on a stage, a boy started shaking
Lip curled back, place started quaking, yeah, yeah
I ain't got long to go now, baby
I'm flying high
Riding on a medicine train (riding on a medicine train)
Never coming down again, well (never coming down again)
Riding on a medicine train (riding on a medicine train)
I ain't never coming down, never coming down again, sweet Jesus
