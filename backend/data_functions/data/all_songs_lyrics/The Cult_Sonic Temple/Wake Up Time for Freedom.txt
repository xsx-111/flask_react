Wake Up Time for Freedom LyricsWake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time to fly
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Ah-ha, ah-ha-ha, yeah
Ah-ha, ah-ha-ha, well
Ah-ha, ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha, ah-ha-ha
There's someone knocking on my door
A tall dark figure I've never seen before
His badge shone brightly like a star in the sky
Drag me out to the waiting car
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time to fly
Wake up time for freedom, baby
A flock of vultures spinning round my head
Left me on the roadside for dead
Cars pass by but no one stares
These waking dreams, they never end
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time to fly
Wake up time for freedom
You we gotta try
Lawman on the bank now, honey
Hound dog on my trail
Wake up time for freedom
Before the night prevails
There's someone knocking on my door
A tall dark figure I've never seen before
Yeah, backs on blinding, like a star in the sky
He drag me out to the waiting car
Sometimes, like this, they came
Ah-ha, ah-ha-ha, yeah
Ah-ha, ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha, ah-ha-ha, yeah
Ah-ha, ah-ha-ha
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time to fly, yeah
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time to fly, yeah
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time to fly
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time to fly
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time for freedom, baby...
Freedom...Embed
