Marine Girls LyricsTry so hard, try to be
What every girl should be
Try so hard, try to be
What every girl should be
Try to hard, try to be
What every girl should be
Try to hard, try to be
What every girl should be
Make , good with children
Not too smart and no opinions
Bright and pretty, sweet and willing
Finds every party thrilling
Try to hard, try to be
What every girl should be
Try to hard, try to be
What every girl should be
Try to hard, try to be
What every girl should be
Try to hard, try to be
What every girl should beEmbed
