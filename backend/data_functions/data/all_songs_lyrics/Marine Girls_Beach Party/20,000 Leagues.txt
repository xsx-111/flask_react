20,000 Leagues Lyrics20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where my baby said he'd meet me
20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where he said I'd have to be
20,000 leagues down, down, down
20,000 leagues down from town
20,000 league's worth of breath
20,000 leagues, near to death
20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where my baby said he'd meet me
20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where he said I'd have to be
20,000 leagues into the deep
20,000 leagues of watery sleep
20,000 leagues of fish and sharks
20,000 leagues of gloomy dark
20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where my baby said he'd meet me
20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where he said I'd have to be
20,000 leagues, will you be there?
20,000 leagues, I didn't swear
20,000 leagues, where seaweed is red
20,000 leagues, where starfish are deadEmbed
