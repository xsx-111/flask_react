Day/Night Dreams LyricsCome down to my house
Come down to dance
We can be sweet
And start a romance
We can put on a disc
Drink lemon and tea
You can smoke if you like
When you're with me
And then when we return
We could drive in the car
Play on the swings and slides
Stay 'til it's dark
And then 
Your phone will ring
But I think 
Because you're not inEmbed
