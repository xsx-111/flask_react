He Got the Girl LyricsBest friend is so happy
Sits in each night with the TV
Turns the music down
No longer hangs round town 'cause
He got the girl
This boy is so naive
Puts faith in his friend's loyalty
He should know better
He'll go all out to get her
And he'll get the girl
So how fun it seems
The ends justify the means
He can't pretend
He knows he's lost his best friend
But he got the girlEmbed
