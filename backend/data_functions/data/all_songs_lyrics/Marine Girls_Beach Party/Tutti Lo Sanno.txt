Tutti Lo Sanno LyricsDon't watch him as he speaks
Don't hang on every word he says
Don't let him see you're looking his way
Don't understand why he has to do the things he does
Listen to excuses, be a fool, it'll break your heart
She knows his reputation
But that's no consolation
This girl can't help but love this boy
Don't let the sunshine catch you dancing in your brand new shoes
The look in that boy's eyes could follow you home tonight
You'll wake at midnight from a dream, there's no doubt about it
It's time to realize you're on your way too
She can see right through him
She knows what he's been doing
But she can't help but love this boy
Who wants a boy who says he'll to anything to please you
Who wants a boy who walks alone at night when you're not there
She speaks to this boy and she knows she doesn't even like him
But hate is a passion that's near to love anyway
Don't care that he's untrue
This is what she's come to
This girl can't help but love this boyEmbed
