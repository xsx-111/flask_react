Silent Red LyricsSometimes I cry to think of
Records with no song
No more
Minutes that have gone
Sometimes I smile to think of
Songs I sing for you
Midnight sunshine shining
Stars that drown in the June
Sometimes I laugh to think of
Times I will know will come true
Moving of the beaches
Teasing with the sun
Sometimes too sometimes I scream
To think of waking
On a moonless morning
To see the world is shakingEmbed
