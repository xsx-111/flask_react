Dishonesty LyricsWhen I see dishonesty
I realize you're telling lies
Throw away every word you say
Dishonesty is hurting me
I don't understand
Don't know why you're lying
I'm confused
Don't know why I'm crying
Dishonesty, I can't believe a word you're telling me
Dishonesty, do you think that I can't see?
Dishonesty, I can't believe a word you're telling me
Dishonesty, do you think that I can't see?
So now I know I should go
See the truth, I should leave you
But I'd rather stay, despite the things you say
All I need is to hear you lie to me
I don't understand
Don't know why you're lying
I'm confused
Don't know why I'm crying
Dishonesty, I can't believe a word you're telling me
Dishonesty, do you think that I can't see?
Dishonesty, I can't believe a word you're telling me
Dishonesty, do you think that I can't see?Embed
