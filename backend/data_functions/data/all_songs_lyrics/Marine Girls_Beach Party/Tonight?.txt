Tonight? Lyrics
(Some guys)  are really obvious and with a side-long glance you see they're smiling every word you say (obvious, quick glance)
(Some girls) like to play it cool, you can stare and stare but they do nothing away (so cool, you stare)
(Some boys) think they're idiots, don't wanna talk to you cause all they wanna do is impress (they're it, don't talk)
(Some boys) use the same old lines, they say "you want to dance?", they say "oh what's your name oh let me guess" (same lines, let's dance)

Hold me tight while we do it tonight

(Sometimes) it can get all too much, people make you talk when all you want to do is to run away (too much, you talk)
(Sometimes) I'm feeling out of touch, no one talks to me, no one wants to hear what I say (out of touch, don't talk)
(Sometimes) we always seem to laugh, t we're all right,  we can really have fun (we laugh, all right)
(Sometimes) we don't even talk and it seems to me we're unhappy but at least we're young (don't talk, it seems)

Don't wanna fight while we do it tonightEmbed
