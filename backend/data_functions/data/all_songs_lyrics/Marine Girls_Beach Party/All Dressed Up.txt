All Dressed Up LyricsThere's a place where no one has been
A land from somewhere in a dream
I wait for him to give me a sign
He waits somewhere passing time
Still I haven't heard
Six weeks now without a word
I am stranded? here today
And he's a million years away
Across the oceans of misty wheat
He waits there so patiently
The feeling everyone knows
All dressed up and nowhere to goEmbed
