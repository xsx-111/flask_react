Times We Used to Spend Lyrics
When I see you walking down the street
When I see you it all comes back to me
Thinking of the times we used to spend together
Thinking of the times I used to see you

Thinking of the times we used to spend
Thinking of the times we used to spend
Thinking of the times we used to spend
Thinking of the times we used to spend

When I hear that tune on the record player
When I hеar that song on the breeze
Thinking of the timеs we used to spend together
Thinking of the times we used to sing alone

Thinking of the times we used to spend
Thinking of the times we used to spend
Thinking of the times we used to spend
Thinking of the times we used to spend

Thinking of the jokes we used to have
Wondering if we're laughing at them now
Somehow don't see how we can be
So what's a smile between us nowEmbed
