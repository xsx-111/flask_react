Holiday Song LyricsBuild me a castle on the beach
We meet the tide but just out of reach
Build me a sand castle on the shore
Show me the sea, well I've seen it before
Bring me the moon, we can play on the sand
Give me a smile, I will give you my hand
Take off your shoes and we'll run to the sea
As soon as dawn, you can come home with me
Steal me a lighthouse that shines so clear
We'll look at the stars as we lie on the pier
When the sun rises I'll be here with you
Down on the beach until the summer's throughEmbed
