Fridays Lyrics
On a Friday evening, staying in tonight
I said I wanna see you, I can't believe you've heard me right
It's not that there's another, it's not that I don't care
It's just I've had enough of the same old places, yeah

Another Friday evening, your mother says you're out tonight
I know you've gone with somebody else, but I say that's alright
I know you never loved me, why did you say you cared?
You said I broke your heart, but I told the truth so I win, yeahEmbed
