Promises LyricsThere she sits without a care in the world
Wondering if they're true, the rumors she's heard
Quiet evening with absent friends
Photographs of long weekends
When she feels she's had enough
She tells herself she's not in love
Her many friends she never rings
Her promises don't mean a thing
There she sits without a thought in her head
Unfinished letters on an unmade bed
Losing count of her many lovers
Paints her life in watercolors
When she starts to feel the strain
She goes away and starts again
The words she felt were never spoken
The promises were never brokenEmbed
