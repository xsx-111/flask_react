Flying Over Russia LyricsLook down at the people smiling
Waving handkerchiefs to the sky
Clouds hang over the hills and mountains
Moscow airport says goodbye
Behind iron curtain across the Berlin wall
No news no word can reach us
There's no one there at all
I'm flying over Russia
Looking where no man can go
I'm flying over Russia
Looking down on Russian snow
Through the frosty window
Looking at the guards below
Just how happy are they
That's something I'll never know
Now the hills and valleys give way to icy plains
I see the rising smoke
From the eastern border trains
I'm flying over Russia
Looking where no man can go
I'm flying over Russia
Looking down on Russian snow
But we don't know
And the Russian snow
It never shows
What only Russians know
I wonder do you believe
The lies that you're sold
I wonder do you ever
Dream of being free
They tell us you had to do what you're told
Well so do weEmbed
