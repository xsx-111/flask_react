Burning Desire - Live at Fillmore East 12/31/69  Lyrics
Burning desire sets my mind on fire
Burning desire sets my mind on fire
I feel my body
But in the meantime there's nothing to dream
In my window of arms

So between Hell and Heaven, you just may see me chase my heart everywhere
And screaming:
Burning desire, hotter than an electric chair


Burning desire, hotter than an electric chair



Came on down hard on me, baby
That's the way I want my love to be
I don't know how long I'm gonna have to bе free
C'mon on down on me one more timе again, baby
All the way down, down, down, down, mm
I'm just a lightbulb sailing through the night
Oh, there's a place to hide now
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh


Burning desire, hotter than an electric chair


Thank you, goodnightEmbed
