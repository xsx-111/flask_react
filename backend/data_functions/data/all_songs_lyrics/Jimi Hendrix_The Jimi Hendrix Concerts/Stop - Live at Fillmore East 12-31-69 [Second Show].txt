Stop - Live at Fillmore East 12/31/69  Lyrics

You better stop it, baby (Stop it, baby)
You better stop it, baby (Stop it, baby)
Stop it, baby (Stop it, baby)
Stop your jivin' 'round (Don't go jivin' around)
Oh yeah
It's alright
Hey

Well, stop (Stop)
Baby, can't you see that I can't take it no more?
No, no, baby
Stop
Baby, I'm 'bout to go right on through the floor
Oh yeah, baby
Never knew what good love could be
Love is gon' make a fool of me, yeah
Everything is hazy (Everything is hazy, baby)
One more kiss and yell (One kiss and you drive me crazy)

Stop
Hold it just a minute while I go catcha my breathe
You know what I feel, baby
Stop
Don't you know that you scare my poor heart half to death?
Oh yeah, baby
Thought I was a captain of a ship
Oh yeah, love gonna make me lose my grip
Everything is hazy (Everything is hazy, baby)
One more kiss and yell (One more kissin' you drive me crazy)

Stop
Stop
Stop
Stop



Well, stop
Can't you see that I can't take it no more?
No, no, baby
Stop
Baby, I'm 'bout to go right on through the floor?
But you know what I feel, baby

Thought you was the captain of my ship
Oh yeah, love gonna make me lose my grip
Everything is hazy (Everything is hazy, baby)
One more kiss and yell (One more kissin' you drive me crazy)
Stop
Stop
Stop
Stop
