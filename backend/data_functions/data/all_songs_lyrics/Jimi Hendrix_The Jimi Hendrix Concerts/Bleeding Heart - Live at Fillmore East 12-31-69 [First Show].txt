Bleeding Heart - Live at Fillmore East 12/31/69  Lyrics

Yeah

People, people, people
Do you know what it means to be left alone?
Oh, people, people, people
Do you know what it means to be left alone?
No letter today
Lord, not even a call on my telephone
So sad

Understandin' and a little lovin'
A little lovin' all in the world I need
Understandin' and a little lovin', baby
Lord, that's all in the world I need
A misunderstandin' and a no good woman
They both have caused my heart to bleed

Yeah


Every morning
Lord, thе willow's weeping moan for me
Lord, every morning
Lord, thе willow's weeping moan for me
My baby loved me
Now my heart's in misery
