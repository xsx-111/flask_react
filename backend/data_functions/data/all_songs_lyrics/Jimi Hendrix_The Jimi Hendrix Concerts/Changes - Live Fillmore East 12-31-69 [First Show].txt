Changes - Live Fillmore East 12/31/69  Lyrics

Well my mind is goin' through them changes
I feel just like I'm in the crime
Every time you see me going some where
I feel like I'm goin' out of my mind, yeah
Oh, my baby, she left me the other day
And we were having so much fun yeah, yeah
Oh, my baby, she stepped out on me
And that's the reason why she had to run

It's alright
Oh, yeah, yeah
It's alright
What I say?
It's alright
Ooh, yeah

Well my mind is goin' through them changes
I think I'm goin' out of my mind
Every time you see me going some wherе
I think I could commit a crime now
She had me running
Shе had me crying
She had me running
Had me, had me, had me crying, yeah
She had me running
She had me crying
She had me running
Oh
It's alright
Yeah, yeah
It's alright


Said my mind is goin' through them changes
I worked so hard everyday
She don't understand
I work, I work so hard and I bring it all on home to her
Every Friday afternoon
And the next day
My  goin' away
She goes out and spends it all
Don't wanna give me nothing, y'all
She cuts me all the time
She goes out, commits some bigger crimes to me
And she knows
And she knows
She knows that I feel it
And she knows
She don't wanna give back
She don't ever wanna do that
Oh, my baby, she's always goin' somewhere
Oh, my baby, she don't even care
Oh, she ain't ever had much to say, nah, no
She don't have very much to say
After I, no no
It's alright
She's my love
She's my 
She's my woman
She's uptight
Oh oh oh oh
She's my love
Don't know I'm there
She turns away
To her favorite plays
She turned to fake
She turned to fake
She turned to fake
She turned to fake
She turned to fake
She said , ah!
She tried everything
She tried everything, nah
Shout
She's everything
Oh

Ah!
Hm

Gonna do a song dedicated to the same ol' dragon queen goin' on
In Vietnam and so forth
Thing called "Izabella"
We'll play "Izabella"Embed
