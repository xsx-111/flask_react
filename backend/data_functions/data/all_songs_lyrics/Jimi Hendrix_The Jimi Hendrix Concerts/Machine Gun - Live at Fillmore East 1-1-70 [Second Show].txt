Machine Gun - Live at Fillmore East 1/1/70  Lyrics
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Evil man make me kill you
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart

Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
You know what I mean?
Hey, and your bullets keep knocking me down
Hey, I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah, but you still blast me down, to the ground

The same way you shoot me down, baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey, machine gun

I ain't afraid of your mess no morе, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After awhilе your, your cheap talk won't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
Because I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be going just the same

Yeah, machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah, yeah, alright
Tearing my family apart


Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Oh where he can't survive no, no
Yeah, that's what we don't want to hear anymore, alright
(No bullets)
At least here, huh huh
(No guns, no bombs)
Huh huh
No nothing, just let's all live and live
You know instead of killingEmbed
