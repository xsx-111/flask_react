Power of Soul - Live at Fillmore East 12/31/1969  Lyrics
The Fillmore is proud to welcome back some very old friends with a brand new name
Jimi Hendrix and the Band of Gypsys!


Shot down some of those airplanes, baby
Especially the ones that you're flying low
Come on back to me, sunshine
Come on back, come with me
We’ve all been up through the night time baby
Now let's read the rays of reality

With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of soul
Anything is possible


It's so groovy to float around sometimes
Even a jelly fish will agree to that
It’s so groovy to float around sometimes
Even a jelly fish will agree to that
Yeah, but that jelly fish been floating around so long
Since 
He don't got a bone in his jelly back
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
