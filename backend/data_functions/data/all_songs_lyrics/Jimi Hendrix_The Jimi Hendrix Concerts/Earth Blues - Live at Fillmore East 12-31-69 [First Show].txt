Earth Blues - Live at Fillmore East 12/31/69  Lyrics
I see hands, and I see tear-stained faces
Reaching up but not quite touching on promised land
I see  and a whole lotta tears wasted
Saying, "Please, send us a helping hand, oh Lord"

(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Just happy to hear some changes
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Know it's about that time to find it
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, freedom's ever marching to me
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Keep everybody alright

I hear the sound of freedom's marching drum
You and I be there, young and old
You better love me now like it's gonna be the last time, darling
And tell our child you'll sell daddy's broken clothes

(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Up there stands a woman, baby
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
And I feel her burning light on mе
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Could this be God's answer?
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
It'd sure hеlp me
(Everybody)
Everybody
(Everybody)
Keep the light
(Everybody)
Everything's alright
(Everybody)
Everybody
(Everybody)
Time for suppertime
(Everybody)
I see the sky red
(Everybody)
Like a wine

(Everybody)
Help me, baby
(Everybody)
Help me, Father
(Everybody)
Help me, Mother
(Everybody)
I've reached so far
(Everybody)
Help me, Brother
(Everybody)
Come show the light
(Everybody)
Make everything all right
(Everybody)

We only have one more song left
So we'll do this thing
We're gonna do this thing called "Burning Desire"
Let's do this thing
Thank you everyone for showing up, man
Get all together and come back and redo it
Right, right
Happy new year to everybody in happy new year land
Yeah, yeah
And we should all hang up...Embed
