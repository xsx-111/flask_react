Machine Gun - Live at Fillmore East 12/31/69  Lyrics
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Evil man make me kill ya
Evil man make you kill me
Even though we're
Even though we're families apart

Blowin' away all my family
My only mother's child
Blowin' away all my family
My mother's only child

Don't you understand, machine gun?
That's the same way you been blowin' up the Bahamas
Three times a pain
Run across your brain

Over yonder, stands a mother
Sending clothes to her son by the war
I said "I'm her lover, baby
And we don't even try to fight the war
So shoot your bullets up a while and call me, baby
Of matter fact, you can shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot some more


Ooh ooh...

Well I pick up an axe sometimes, and fight like a farmer
And you shoot me down, right back in the ground
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
Put me right back down in the earth I was workin' on
Don't you shoot me down
Don't you shoot me down
The same way you shoot me down, baby
 always just upset
 bad
Shoot me down
