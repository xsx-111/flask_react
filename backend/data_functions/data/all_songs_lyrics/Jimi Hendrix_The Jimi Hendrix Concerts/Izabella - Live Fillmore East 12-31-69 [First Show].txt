Izabella - Live Fillmore East 12/31/69  Lyrics

Izabella

Girl, I’m dreaming about you every night
Yeah, my darling
You know we got this war to fight
So I'm coming to you on the fire
And I hope you're receiving me right

Izabella

Girl, I'm fighting this war for the children and you
Hey, yeah darling, I'm fighting this war for the children and you
So if you give your love to me, then
I know  ain't true


Izabella
Here comes the rays of the rising sun
Yeah yeah, we gotta run, baby
We're gonna have another on the run
So keep those dreams coming in strong
Soon I’ll be holding you instead of these machine guns
'Stead of these machine guns
'Stead of these machine guns

Izabella
