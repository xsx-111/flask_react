Message to Love - Live at Fillmore East 12/31/69  Lyrics
What a world
I said we're driving under speed
Oh the reaper man
We've got a lot of love to give
Better come on if you can

Ooh, ooh

Said I'm talking 'bout love
They try to run away
Check yourself out, baby
And then come with me today
Good lovin'
Over here, is

Here comes a women
Wrapped up in chain
You pull that , baby
When your life in pain
If you rather be free
Come along with me
And leavе a hard-hitting man
He'll never undеrstand
I said, uh "Bring yourself first"
And spend ya time 
Work hard in your mind
Only if you come alive
Baby, prove to the land
You understand
Your eyes are gone

Hey
Come on, baby
Come on with me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Everybody, live a life, live a life
Everybody, love a lot
Everybody, hear it
Hear my message
Of love
Of, of love
Hey!

Ayy!
Come on, baby
Come on

Vibe with me, babyEmbed
