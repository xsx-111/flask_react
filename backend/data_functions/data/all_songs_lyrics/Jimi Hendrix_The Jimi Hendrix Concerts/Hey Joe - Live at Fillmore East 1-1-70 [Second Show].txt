Hey Joe - Live at Fillmore East 1/1/70  Lyrics
Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going with that gun in your hand?

I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
And that ain't too cool

Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down
You shot her down, now
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your old lady down
You shot her down to the ground

Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught her messing around, messing around town
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught my old lady messing around town
And I gave her the gun, I shot her!

Hey Joe, alright
Shoot her one more time, baby
Hey Joe, where you going to run to now?
Where you going to run to?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going to run to now?
Where you, where you going to go?
Well, dig it

I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way, alright
I'm going way down south
Way down where I can be free
There's no one going to find me

Ain't no hangman going to
He ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now, I got to go now

Hey Joe, you better run on down
Goodbye everybody, ow!
Hey Joe, run on downEmbed
