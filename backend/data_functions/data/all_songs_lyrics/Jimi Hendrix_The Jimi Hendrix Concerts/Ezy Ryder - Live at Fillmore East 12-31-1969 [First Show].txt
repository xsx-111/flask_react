Ezy Ryder - Live at Fillmore East 12/31/1969  Lyrics
You see this picture called "Ezy Ryder?"
It was bad as hell, I appreciate that
I don't know for what, but there was something goin' on
So we got this thing called, uh
We're gonna call this The Ezy Ryder
We're gonna make up the words as we go along
'Cause we got about twenty verses for it
It goes something like this

Oh, Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Riding down the highways of desire
Trying
To find higher
Tryna reach the heavens above
But he's dying to be loved


He's got a living
In magic
Today is no happily day
He's dying
So tragic
But don't you worry about today
We got freedom coming our way
Freedom coming
Tryna get all the brothers to fight to be free
Lookin' at all the lovers, sayin' "Do what you please"
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey, motorcycle mama
Will you marry me?
And I'll be stone crazy
Stone crazy
Stone crazy
Stone crazy
Stone crazy

Oh, Ezy
Ezy Ryder
He's known to be guilty, insane
'Cause he's trying
To find higher
He's gonna go out in the rain
 this to say
Ride on
Ride on
I don't care

Run on right, Ezy Ryder
Run right on

Blown away

We'll wait until they get onstage together
 here and there
Not might be right
But we're going in the studio together, anywayEmbed
