Lover Man  - Live at Fillmore East 12/31/1969  Lyrics

Here he comes, baby
Here comes your lover man
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I'll sneak out the window
I really gotta go as fast as I can
Reach up, baby
And hand me down my running shoes
Reach up, baby
Hand me down my running shoes
See your man coming on
Babe, I've got no time to lose



I wanna love you longer
Yes, I wanna love you stronger
 over yonder
If that's your man, way over yonder, then

Yeah, that silly little thing we always mеss around with
That first thing is called  if you wanna call it that
That other thing's called, I don't know, I forgot about that
Anyways, wе like to do us a little blues here
It's alright
We like to do a thing called "Lonesome Train," we call itEmbed
