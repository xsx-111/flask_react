Call the Doctor Lyrics
They want to socialize you
They want to purify you
They want to dignify and analyze and terrorize you

This is love and you can't make it
(Look out, they want what you know)
In a formula or shake me
(Steal a kid, break a heart, steal the show)
I'm your monster, I'm not like you
(Peel back the skin, see what's there)
All your life is written for you
(I'll never show you what's in here)

Your life is good for one thing
You're messing with what's sacred
They want to simplify your needs and likes
To sterilize you

This is love and you can't make it
(Don't need you to explain the pain)
In a formula or break it
(I can prove to you it's all fake)
I'm your monster, I'm just like you
(She's dead but she can stand and she can walk)
All my life is right before you
(Call the doctor, miracle, she can talk)
Call the doctor
(you)
Call the doctor
(are)
Call the doctor
(not)
Call the doctor
(me)
Call the doctor
(you)
Call the doctor
(are)
Call the doctor
(not)
Call the doctor
(me)

This is love and you can't break it
(This is not really me at all)
In a formula or make me
(Stunt girl, dance and twirl, watch me fall)
I'm no monster, I'm just like you
(Carbon copy, same body, different hearts)
All my life is right before me
(Can't tell anymore, the real parts)Embed
