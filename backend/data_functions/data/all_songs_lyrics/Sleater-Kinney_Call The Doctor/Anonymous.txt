Anonymous Lyrics
She's worried, she's worried, she's worried she said too much
And talking, I'm talking, she's talking like books I read
It's easy, it's easy, it's easy to shut yourself off
Never on the record, it'll never show up

She wants to be, to be anonymous
I sign, I sign, I sign anonymous

Feel safe, inside, inside those well drawn lines
Boyfriend, a car, a job, my white girl life
She swallowed the spider to catch, to catch that fly
But I don't know why, why she swallowed that lie

She wants to be, to be anonymous
I sign, I sign, I sign anonymous
She wants to be, to be like everybody else
I sign, I sign, I sign anonymous

Not enough for you to know
Not enough for you to own
Not enough for you to know
Not enough for you to own
She wants to be, to be anonymous
I sign, I sign, I sign anonymous

These words are all I have
These words are who I amEmbed
