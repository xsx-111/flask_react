Hubcap Lyrics
Write in passing when there's time
Hide the paper, hide my mind
(Talk late, words, advice)
Keep you quiet, keep you blind
(Talk late, time flies)
Don't rock the boat, don't read the sign
(Watch, wait, words, lies)

You're my co-pilot
Not my god pilot

You take everything
You take what I want
You take everything
You take what I...

Want from you is so defined
Your suit and tie, your shiny smile
(Talk late, words, advice)
Your calm belief, your piece of mind
(Talk late, time flies)
I'll trade you for it, then run, then fly
(Watch, wait, words, lies)
You're my co-pilot
Not my god pilot

You take everything
You take what I want
You take everything
You take what I want

You take what I want
You take what I want
You take what I wantEmbed
