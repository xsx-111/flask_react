Little Mouth LyricsDamn you, damn you!
Smile pretty, take, take the money
You know me well, oh, don't you?
Smile pretty, take, take the money
You know how to sell?
I do
I'm your little, I'm your little
I'm your little mouth
Did ya want me?
I'm your little, I'm your little
I'm your little mouth
Did ya want me?
Damaged goods

Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna
Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna
Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna
Oh, you wanna try her?
Oh, I think I wanna
'Cause I'm your little, I'm your little
I'm your little mouth
Did ya want me?
I'm your little, I'm your little
I'm your little mouth
Did ya want me?
