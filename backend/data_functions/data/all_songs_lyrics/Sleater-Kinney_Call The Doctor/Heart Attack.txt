Heart Attack LyricsHeart attack
I wait for
Hit and run
Could happen any day
I'm walking to your house
'Cause I really want to figure you out
It's always somewhere and someone new each day
As long as I'm not, I'm not
Looking for me
Looking for me
Insomnia
Popping pills
It's still too tight
It's never right
Threw out everything I own again today
Something's bound to give me a disease
I still feel like nothing next to you
'Cause you wanted, you wanted
Everything
New
Everything
New, new
Stress case, undone, pre-planned, no fun
I'm scared, I've scared them all away
High strung, let go, loss of control
I'm scared, I've scared the sleep away
Heart attack
Hit and runEmbed
