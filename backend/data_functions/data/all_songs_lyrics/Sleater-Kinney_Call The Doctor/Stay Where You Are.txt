Stay Where You Are Lyrics
I can't find you
Stay where you are
I'm in the dark
Stay where you are

(I'm alright)
She's dead if you want and that's me if you want
Stuffed in the corner, "Little girl lost"
(I feel fine)
And I claw and I scratch and I beg and I scream
I just need you to save me one last time
(You're my life)
It's me if you want but it's not what I want
I want to burn up the place, set it on fire
(I'm alright)
She's back 'cause she wants to not be contained
I can't tell the truth, I can't speak this way

You can't find me
You're in the dark
I'm right here
Stay where you are
(I'm alright)
She's dead if you want and that's me if you want
Stuffed in the corner, "Little girl lost"
(I feel fine)
And I claw and I scratch and I beg and I scream
And I just need you to save me one last time
(You're my life)
It's me if you want but it's not what I want
I want to burn up the place, set it on fire
(I'm alright)
She's back 'cause she wants to set things on fire
I can't tell the truth, I can't speak this way

I'm right here, right here
Where you are
I'm right here, right here
Where you are

(I'm alright)
She's dead if you want and that's me if you want
Stuffed in the corner, "Little girl lost"
(I feel fine)
I claw and I scratch and I beg and I scream
And I just need you to save me this time
(You're my life)
It's me if you want but it's not what I want
I want to burn up the place, set it on fire
(I'm alright)
She's back 'cause she wants to not be contained
I can't tell the truth, I won't speak your wayEmbed
