Kotov Syndrome Lyrics
They're high on the watchtower, keeping the peace
Whatever that means
Cause you see the world through
Crosshairs and TVs, don't you?
Ten foot walls built around us, white picket death
So quiet, so safe
If we fall there'll be nothing and no one to catch us
Sit back and watch as we

Spin out of control
Spin out of control
Try to recover but collide with each other we
Spin out of control

Something I cannot change
I was born in a place that lives by the sword
And thus to its blade we're condemned
Don't you understand why we scream "no more"?
My dreams are of children orphaned by blood
Spilled at these hands
And here on the graves of the innocent
We raise our flag
Spin out of control
Spin out of control
Try to recover but collide with each other we
Spin out of control

Some things you don't forgive, some things you don't forget
Sometimes the fate you suffer is so much worse than death
But we're off course now and we're drifting out to sea
So cut the anchor on your heart to be set free
Set free
Set free

Spin out of control
Spin out of control
Spin out of control
Spin out of control
Try to recover, we have to recover
We fall and crash, one after the other
Spin out of control4Embed
