Savior Lyrics
It kills me not to know this
But I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were
And her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten

There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Like walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear

So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!
And the day pressed on like crushing weights
For no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days
That deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand
Uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand
Now do you understand?

So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!

One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again...
I don't hate you...
I don't hate you, no...

So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!

I don't hate you
I don't hate you (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
I don't hate you
I don't hate you, no
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!48Embed
