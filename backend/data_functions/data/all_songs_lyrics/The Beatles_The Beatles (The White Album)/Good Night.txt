Good Night Lyrics
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight

Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

Mmm

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody, everywhere
