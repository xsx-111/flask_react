Honey Pie Lyrics
She was a working girl North of England way
Now she's hit the big time in the U.S.A.â€‹
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say

Honey Pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

Oh, honey pie, my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me
Ooh, yeah
I like it like that, oh ah

I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, Hollywood blues

Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?
Tee, tee, tee

Now Honey Pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Come, come back to me, Honey Pie

Ooh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Honey Pie, Honey Pie1Embed
