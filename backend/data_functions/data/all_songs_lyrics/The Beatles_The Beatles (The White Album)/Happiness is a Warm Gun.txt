Happiness is a Warm Gun Lyrics
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

(Down)
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Happiness is a warm gun (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, mama (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)

When I hold you in my arms (Ooh, oh, yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (Ooh, oh, yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (Ooh, oh, yeah)
Because

(Happiness) Is a warm gun, mama (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Well, don't you know that happiness is a warm gun, mama?
(Is a warm gun, yeah)24Embed
