Less Than LyricsI woke up
Brush my hair
There's not much there
I reveal more and more
Sculpting the bust
Of a man I'll forever ignore
While you gloss all your fear
Shout it from the rooftop
Then hide in the basement and cheer
You're less than me
I am nothing
I am nothing
You're less than me
I am nothing
I am nothing
You're less than me
I am nothing
I am nothing
You're less than me
I am nothing
I am nothingEmbed
