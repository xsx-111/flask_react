Under a Rock LyricsMaybe you got your head caught in a ditch last night
I got to you, imparting
Now you're someone else's mess tonight
And I got upset, I told you twice
That I know how to break inside
The brick house that you built around your cranium
You wear it like a crown
Maybe I let on that I was interested
In your brand of lonely
A book you cracked once and never read
Your ravenous, insatiable
Appetite for the expendable
Will leave you just as hollow as your requiem
You'll bang it like a drum
Maybe
