La Loose Lyrics
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo

In the middle of my eyes
Are the blackhills of tonight
And you can lean on me for now
I am frozen in time
And when the sun burns I'll turn red
But I will feel so close to dead
And I will visualize a tragedy
And blame you for it
I get why you would long for your past
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
I know why you would run away so fast
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo

And I'll try to preserve the routine
And I don't want to discuss what it means
And you're the only one I want watching me
In the night of full consort
When the stars are holding court
We will be in another world
Where my clarity's restored
And this charming picture of
Hysteria in love
It could fade or wrinkle up
I don't hold faith in much
I know that I feel more than you do
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
I selfishly want you here to stick to
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo

And I'll try to preserve the routine
And I don't want to discuss what it means
And you're the only one I want watching me

Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo1Embed
