Breathless Lyrics
You look at me like I'm a rose
Singing a song that you don't know
And you always walk so slow
If I was foolish I would chase
A feeling I long ago let fade
And we could be good for days

You take what you want
You wear it out
I'm not trying to be a rose
You see me how
I wish I was
But I'm not trying to be seen

You strike a chord with all my friends
Saying that stuff that will transcend
A sad story with an end
But if I just cloy myself in light
And stare at your picture late at night
Then I could just close my eyes

You take what you want
You call me back
I'm not trying to be yours
You indulge me
I indulge you
But I'm not trying to have it all2Embed
