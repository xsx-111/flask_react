Blue LyricsWe, we never leave the beach
We'll grow numb to the mystique
And the world spins as we sleep
Running water, running
Running water, running
Some are allergic to the sun
They'll grow numb in the long run
They'll get everything they want
Running water, running
Running water, running
Running water, running
Running water, running
Running water, running
Running water, running
Running water, running
Running water, runningEmbed
