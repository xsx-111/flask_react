Summer of Love LyricsI didn't think, now I'm here
Treading water without you
My reflection is wry, it's enticing
But I couldn't last long here without you
And I gave it up, the mystique
The colors allure me but I can't make out
A face in the picture of palm trees
The summer of love is a photo of us
I lose a thought and I'm here
Reaching for poise as I'm speaking
Conversations are dry and I absolve
Playing alert, but I’m sleeping
I gave it up, the mistake
The colors allure me but I can’t make out
A face in the picture of palm trees
The summer of love is a photo of us
The summer of love is a photo of us
The summer of love is a photo of usEmbed
