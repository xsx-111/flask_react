Poison LyricsI watch you anxiously
You paint it celestial, you paint it serene
What do you want, what do you need?
A welcome mat
You get lazy, you get boring
You jump the track
And your birthday party tongue dripping
You'll summarize
Travel the world ivy tripping
With no spotlight
I fill your plastic cup
I'm cooling in peacefulness
You dress it up
What do I want? What do I think?
Nobody hears
I take all the space I need
And my tears run clear
While your short-term memory's slipping
You'll improvise
Travel the world ivy tripping
With no spotlight1Embed
