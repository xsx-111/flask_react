Bonfire LyricsYou got your mind set on it
Losing me over the head on it
You splatter your logic like
I came here to see the first day of your life
The speed of light fixates on you
Moving through time, a failed pursuit
Give off a spark, light up the room
You got your heart broken now
You unfold it when you're falling down
You tell me she was boring you
She keeps ticking behind glass walls, good as new
The speed of light's over your head
Moving through night, faces you'll forget
You ask a lot, she said go ahead
He said go ahead, I say go aheadEmbed
