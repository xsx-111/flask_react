Hot Rock LyricsI'm on to you
Before the night is through
I'm going to steal this diamond
Hot rock to you
I just need to know
(I'm not the one you wanted)
Now am I to know what you want me to feel?
(Not the thing you keep)
Counterfeit or real?
It's a caper theme
There's a getaway car
A diamond to steal
A plan that might go wrong
If this is a set up
Please let me know
I can't risk my life for a gilded stone
(I thought all along this was everything
Try not to look too hard to find that it's not real
I knew all along you weren't everything
Then in the darkest hour, I watched you disappear)
(I'm not the one you wanted)
How am I to know what you want me to feel?
(Not the thing you keep)
I'm onto you
It's a crafty scene
Full of power and greed
You tell me not to steal
Yet, you still want a thief
You write out the plans
I carry out the act
But then I lose it all
If I can't bring it back
(How was I to know this rock was so fragile?
It cracked in my hands while I was holding on
An uncut stone is flawed and beautiful
Don't try to size me down to fit your tiny hands)
(I'm not the girl you wanted)
How am I to know what you want me to feel?
(Not the one you keep)
Counterfeit or real?
(It's not real
You don't need to tell me that it's not real
You don't need to tell me)
How am I to know?
(I'm not the one you wanted)
That you were ever here
(I'm not the one you keep)
I'm onto you
Before this night is through
I'm going to steal my heart back
And find a love that's true
Hot rock to youEmbed
