One Song for You LyricsIf you want it and you're going out of your mind
If you want me in your bed
We better do it on the sly
One Song for you
(And you know why)
We wrote a little tune
(Do it on the sly)
It takes off for you
(And you know why)
Hold on, hold on it's coming soon
If you feel it in your body like a hurricane
Let your arms become propellers
Take off don't feel any shame
I know for you
(Like a hurricane)
It don't make sense, I don't make sense
(Feel no shame)
Nothing comes true
(you're like a hurricane)
Because the doors were locked for you
Got a message spelled out in a lovesick bruise
I got this secret code
That only flame holders know how to use
Piled up for you
(It's a lovesick blues)
The notes I wrote on hollow walls
(You know how to use)
Let me come through
(Show me how to use)
Pass through the things that we went through
Jump in, jump out
Get in, get out
Jump in, jump out
Get in, get out
Have memory of the things we said
(Jump in, jump out)
Take memory of the things we left
(Get in, get out)
Have memory of the things we said
(Jump in, jump out)
Take memory of the things you left
(Get in, get out)
Drop little boy crumbs you could follow back
When you get lost becoming a man
Drop little boy crumbs you could follow back
When you get lost becoming a man
It's a lie, it's the truth
You need it more than I do
I want it all for you
But I can't live for youEmbed
