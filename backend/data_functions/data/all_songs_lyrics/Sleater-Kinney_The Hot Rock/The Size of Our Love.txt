The Size of Our Love LyricsOur love is the size of
These tumors inside us
Our love is the size of
This hospital room, you're my hospital groom
The ring on my finger
So tight it turns blue
A constant reminder
I'll die in this room, if you die in this room
And sit like a watchdog
You patiently wait
And listen for footsteps down the hallways
Visit beds like they're graves
Days go by so slowly
Nights go by so slowly
Days go by so slowly
In a hospital room, in a box built for two
Fight for air, fight for my own air
Forget all the things I couldn't do alone
Fight for a heart, fight for a strong heart
Fight to never know the sickness you know
And know it's my home
I gave it a home
Our love is the size of
These tumors inside us
Our love is the size of
This hole in the ground where my heart's buried nowEmbed
