Banned from the End of the World LyricsBanned from the end of the world
(If you want me there, I'll play forever dear)
End of the world, end of the world
(Open up the box a new life rushes out)
I've no millennial fear
(Nasty little bug, much work to be done)
The future is here, it comes every year
(Eat all the numbers up, we're 00 gone)
Hot, hot, go back, these eyes are shut
If you want it, I'll come right over
Then throw me out when the party's over
Banned from the end of your world
(If you want me there, we'll party without fear)
End of the world, end of the world
(A new world rushes on and we'll just play along)
We can bottle time
(A night of revelry spend it here with me)
And sell it back, it's a nostalgic crime
(For so many dreams cannot be contained)
Hot, hot, go back, these eyes are shut
If you want it, I'll come right over
Then throw me out when the party's over
Banned from the end of the world
(We're the band from the end of the world)
The future is here, look in the mirror
('Cause we're the band from the end of the world)1Embed
