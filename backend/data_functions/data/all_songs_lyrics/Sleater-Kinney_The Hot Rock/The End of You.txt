The End of You LyricsBuild for me your tightest ship
Make the oars run swift and fast
Send me out your strongest crew
Make their hearts and minds steadfast
Bless me with Athena
There's no meaner, she's the best
For when we hit the roughest seas
We'll need all we can get
You say, "sink or swim"
What a cruel, cruel phrase
I'd rather fly
Don't want to be caught in this endless race
The first beast that will appear
Will entice us with money and fame
If you listen long enough
You'll forget there's anything else
Tie me to the mast
Of this ship and of this band
Tie me to the greater things
The people that I love
You can walk the plank
Do the dead man's float
Never let them see
Your heart is pounding full of hope
Let the last storm hit us
Let it strike at the hardest part
Turn us all to mutiny
Turn this boat upside down
I am not the captain
I am just another fan
Sailing off the edge of truth
Into the end of you
Eye of the storm
What a cruel, cruel myth
There's no bigger spotlight
Than shone on the ones brave enough to live
The end of you, the end of you
The end of truth, I've been looking for you
The end of you, end of you
The end of you, I've been looking for you1Embed
