Memorize Your Lines LyricsI've learned how to wait (say forever)
I know not to beg (that's a dirty word)
I know I shouldn't ask why (will you stay here?)
I wake up feeling dead (that's a dirty girl)
(Act two, scene four) Performance of your life
Performance of my life (line three, I want this room)
Performance of your life (just for me, just for me)
You said you'd never be mine
You swore it to me until the end of time
You said that love's never kind
I memorize these lines, practice them every night
We can talk it out (it will be soon now)
Tell each other lies (heard that before)
We can just pretend (you better polish your speech)
Today isn't goodbye (before you hit the floor)
(Act two, scene four) Performance of your life
Performance of my life (line three, I want this room)
Performance of your life (just for me, just for me)
You said you'd never be mine
You swore it to me until the end of time
You said that love's never kind
I memorize these lines, practice them every night
Won't you tell me what are we fighting for?
Do you want me here do you know for sure?
You know the coldest face is the worst to me
And I won't calm down till I get to you
Won't you tell me what are we fighting for?
(You said you'd never be mine)
Do you want me here, do you know for sure?
(You swore it to me until the end of time)
You know the coldest face is the worst to me
And I won't calm down till I get to you
You know that I wish I could undo this role
Let's go back to what, what we came here forEmbed
