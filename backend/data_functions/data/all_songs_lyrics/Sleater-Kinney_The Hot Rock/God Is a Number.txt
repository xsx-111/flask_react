God Is a Number Lyrics(spoken) one hundred twenty-five, one twenty-six, one hundred twenty-seven, one twenty-eight, one hundred twenty-nine...
We're a reference number, a code, a screen
An army out of digits, out of fax machines
Mapping out the head and heart, mapping out the history
If a part does not compute, cut it out, cut it free
God is a Number
God is a Number
What you want to know? What can you believe?
Grow up on the internet, get off on TV
Tell me about God and Country, music, heart and history
Answer me with computations, answer me with industry
God is a Number
God is a Number
Knock on every door, programmed to receive
Answer my communication, display, command, retreat
Looking for some kind of heart inside this great machine
I don't get an answer except 011 011 01
God is a Number
God is a Number
I need something to believe
I need something and I
I need something to believe
I need it right now
I need something to believe
I need it right now, I need it right now, I need it right now
(spoken) one hundred thirty-two, one hundred thirty-three, one hundred thirty-four, one thirty-five, one hundred thirty-six, one hundred thirty-seven, one thirty-eight....Embed
