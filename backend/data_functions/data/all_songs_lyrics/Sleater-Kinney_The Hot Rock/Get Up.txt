Get Up LyricsAnd when the body finally starts to let go
Let it all go at once
Not piece by piece
But like a whole bucket of stars
Dumped into the universe
Whoooh! Watch it go!
Good-bye small hands, good-bye small heart
Good-bye small head
My soul is climbing tree trunks
And swinging from every branch
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
(I am fine)
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
(I'm not fine)
Do you think I'm an animal? Am I not?
Do you like fur
(I'm alright)
Do you wanna come over
Are we captive only for a short time
(I'm not right)
Is there splendor, I'm not ashamed
Desire shoots through me like birds singing
(The way you move no ocean's waves were ever as fluid)
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
(I am fine)
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
(I'm not fine)
I hit the mark
I target moon, I target sky, I target sun
Fall down on the world
Fall down on the world
Fall down on the world before it falls on you
Like beggars, like dogs
Like whores, us all
(I'm alright)
Like beggars, like dogs
Like stars, us all
(I'm not right)
Shoot straight for my heart
(And when you were near no sky was ever quite so clear)
Shoot straight for my heart
Like stars, so small
Like us when we fall
(I am fine)
Like beggars, like whores
Like lovers
Oh, get up too far
Oh, get up too far
Like stars above
Look down so far
Like stars above
Look down at us all1Embed
