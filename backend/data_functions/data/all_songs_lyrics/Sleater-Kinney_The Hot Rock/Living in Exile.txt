Living in Exile LyricsOnce I had all, had everything
The real princess, the ruling queen
I walked with arrogance, with vanity
But I made sure my heart they wouldn't see
One day I woke up, all was gone
The castle, kingdom, all were lost
Now I have nothing left, nowhere to go
And my heart that's full of doubt is all I've left to show
She is living in exile
She is living in exile
I'll walk 3,000 lonely miles
I'll start a new life on my own
Don't know what I'm waiting for but when it comes
You know that I'll be ready, a new woman
She is living in exile
She is living in exile
Nothing left but denial
She is living in exile
I know my head is my worst enemy
Swallowed too much of it and started to believe
I know my heart is my worst enemy
Swallowed too much of it and started to believeEmbed
