Dreamer LyricsDreamer, dreamer
Like a fool I thought that it could be
Dream on, dream on, surely someone will understand me
What do I say when I've said too much?
I think by now I'm wastin' time
I'm going, oh Lord, Lord, I'm gone
You are the absence of my mind
Lord, dreamer, I'm a dreamer
Like a fool I thought that it could be
Dream on, dream on
Surely someone, someone will understand me
Down the wrong way on a one way street
You'd think by now I would have learned
I saw a little, ohhh, but I, but I learned my lesson
I only learn, I only learn to regret
Lord, dreamer, dreamer
Like a fool I thought, I thought
It could be
Dream on, dream on
Surely someone, someone will understand me
Dreamer, dreamer
Like a fool I thought that it could be
Dream on, surely someone
Someone will understand me
What do I say, when I said too much?
And I think by now I'm wastin' time
I'm going, Lord, I'm gone, yeah
Surely someone, someone will understand me
Dream on, yeaa, dream on, dream on, dream onEmbed
