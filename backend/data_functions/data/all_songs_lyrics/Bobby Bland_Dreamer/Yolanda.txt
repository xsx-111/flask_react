Yolanda LyricsIf you're in Charleston
Look out for a woman
Hanging out in a bright red Cadillac
She took my money
She left me crying
And I don't know will I ever make it back?
Oh Yolanda
Why you forsake me?
Why you just lay, lay, laid my body down?
Oh Yolanda
Why did you leave me?
In this wilderness with no money down
I was wealthy and lonely when I met her
Had a house, a job and a Cadillac
A lovely wife, a beautiful daughter
I lost them all when she called & I answered back
Oh Yolanda
Why you forsake me?
Why you just lay, lay, lay my body down?
Oh Yolanda
Why did you leave me?
In this wilderness with no money down
If you're in Charleston
Look out for a woman
Hanging out in a bright red Cadillac
She took my money
She left me crying
And I don't know will I ever make it back?
Oh Yolanda
Why you forsake me?
Why you just lay, lay, lay my body down?
Oh Yolanda
Why did you leave me?
In this wilderness with no money down
In this wilderness with no money down
Why did you leave me?
You gone
Oh now you're goneEmbed
