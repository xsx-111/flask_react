Cold Day in Hell LyricsI've got hurt before
And I said it`s gonna be the last time
Took a long time you loved someone else
And then I changed your mind
I gave you all of my heart
Oh, hard, it looks like you've
Chosen your own card
Ooh, for me, oh the world won`t
Come to the end
But it will be a cold day in hell
Before I give my heart again
Oh, Lord, baby
You should have let me down easy
But I woke up to the one-side affair
You should have give me a sign
Showing me, you didn't care
And I`m sitting at home waiting on you
And your mind is on somebody new
Ooh, for me, oh the world won't
Come to the end
But it will be a cold day in hell
Before I give my heart again
Oh, Lord, baby
I'm just sitting around here wondering
Where do I go from here
Ooh, it won't be the someone else's home
I guess I have to cry another tear
I love you more and more
And I know, that, that you been with me when born
For me, oh, the world won't
Come to the end
But it will be a cold day in hell
Before I give my heart again
Oh, Lord, baby
I`m sitting around here wondering
Where do I go from here
Ooh, it won't be the someone else's home
I have to cry another tear
And then there is so cold insideEmbed
