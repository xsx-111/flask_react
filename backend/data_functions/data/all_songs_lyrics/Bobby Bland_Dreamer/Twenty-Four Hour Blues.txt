Twenty-Four Hour Blues LyricsEvery morning when I wake up
Lord I cry a pool of tears
Seven days now, since you left me
Well it seems like seven years
Loneliness keeps hanging around my door
An unwanted friend I can’t lose
Everyday is the same dark old thing
The twenty-four hour blues
Lonely minutes turning to hours
I keep waiting by the telephone
But you don't call me, I guess I’ll be
Spending another sleepless night alone
I can’t seem to get myself together
Without you it’s all bad news;
Everyday is the same dark old thing
Twenty-four hour blues
If you don't hurry on back to me
Then I have nothing else to lose
Justice for ???1
The twenty-four hour blues
I can't lose you
Everyday is the same
The twenty-four hour blues
I can't lose
Everyday, every morning
When I wake up baby
Oh, oh, ooh
The twenty-four hour bluesEmbed
