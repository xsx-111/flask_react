When You Come to the End of Your Road LyricsYou keep sayin' that you don't need me
You keep reminding me that you can make it on your own
You're on top of the world now
Trying to forget me somehow
But no, when your good luck is gone
You know the world, the world is gon' turn cold
But you gonna need somebody waiting there
When you come to your end of the road
Well I wanna be the one
Oh Lord, to help you
When you need a friend
Well baby, oh i wanna be the one, baby
When you, when you need a friend
Well you keep saying, well I'm a dead weight to you
So you don't want no one else
Cause nobody can do the things for you
Oh, you got the world in your hands
And you're walking on me like a .. sand
But when your all good luck is gone
You know the world, the world's gon' turn cold
And you're gonna need somebody waiting there
When you come to your end of the road
Well I'll be the one, oh Lord, to help you
Well, when you need a friend
Well baby, oh Lord, I wanna be the one
Oh Lord, you gonna need somebodyEmbed
