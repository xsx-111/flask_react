I Talk to Jesus LyricsIt's like trying to light a match in the rain
Trying to find a way to explain
I came to meet the face that graced my cable TV
I'm his biggest fan, like this, him and me
Has he gone out? Is he in a meeting?
I know that you can't tell me for security reasons
But, Mister, tell me are you one of the Saints?
Hey, maybe I could take a number and wait
I talk to Jesus
You don't believe me
I talk to Jesus
I know he hears me
And I talk, talk, talk
I talk to Jesus
See, I've got a picture of us here in my wallet
I'd really like to show you
Oh, I must've forgot it
But I've got this bracelet, I've got this ID
That the people down at county gave me
I know you think I'm special, hear it all the time
You don't have to V.I.P. me, I'm a regular guy
I'd really like to sit and talk sometimes
But I'm taping Sally Jesse at five
And I talk to Jesus
You don't believe me
I talk to Jesus
I know he hears me
I talk to Jesus and Elvis Presley
I talk to Jesus
The king can save me
And I talk, talk, talk
I talk to Jesus
Have you seen the papers today?
If I could, I'd get down and pray
Tell me if the shepherds on the way
You know Elvis Presley talks to me
Through my school teacher
John Lennon moved in down the street
He bought the pizzeria
And aliens control our lives
And when we speak they're in our minds
And Heather Locklear is my wife
Man, ain't I a lucky guy?
Why?
'Cause I talk to Jesus
You don't believe me
I talk to Jesus
I know he hears me
I talk to Jesus and Elvis Presley
Man I talk to Jesus
The king can save me
And I talk, talk, talk
I talk to Jesus
I talk to Jesus, woah-oh yeah
I talk to Jesus, woah-oh yeah
I talk to Jesus, woah-oh yeah
I talk to Jesus, woah-ohEmbed
