Staring at Your Window with a Suitcase in My Hand LyricsYou think you know me just because you know my name
You think you see me 'cause you've seen every line of my face
You want to want me just because I say that I want you
But does it matter if anything I'm saying is the truth
You need somebody, somebody to hold on to
But this ain't the movies and we ain't the heroes
Staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand
The streetlights buzz as the cars roll by
And the moon don't give a damn
My boots just keep on walkin', but my heart don't understand
Why I'm staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand
I say I want you, but when we woke up one of us was crying
You rolled over and all you said was 'Man I think I'm dying'
Our song is over, the band of gold has been feeling like a nose
You place your bets, 'cause no one thinks they'll lose
Staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand
The streetlights buzz as the cars roll by
And the moon don't give a damn
My boots just keep on walkin', but my heart don't understand
Why I'm staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand
The light of love can blind you 'til it covers up your eyes
And you try to find the reason not to say goodbye
It's the course of every sailor standing on dry land
Staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand
The night is fading, like my old tattoo
A heart and a dagger, that says 'Forever'
Staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand
The streetlights buzz as the cars roll by
And the moon don't give a damn
I'm gettin' tired of talking, and I don't understand
Why I'm staring at your window with a suitcase in my handEmbed
