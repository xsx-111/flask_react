Every Word Was a Piece of My Heart LyricsI've been staring at the page
For what seems like days
I guess I put this one off for a while
Did I see a tear fall from your eyes
Or did you laugh so hard that you cried
When I served my secrets on a silver tray to you
Hey now, I guess the night's just bringing me down
There's no love, there's no hate
I left them there for you to take
But, know that every word was a piece of my heart
You've been the blood in my veins
The only one who knows my middle name
And the smiles they came easy 'cause of you
You know that I love you, but I hate you
'Cause I know I can never escape you
Let the choir sing for tonight I'm an easy mark
Hey now, am I acting just a little too proud
There's no love, there's no hate
I left them there for you to take
But, know that every word was a piece of my heart
Have I said too much
Maybe I haven't said enough
But know that every word was a piece of my heart
Hush me darling, maybe I've lost my touch
Maybe I've lost my guts - there, is that truth enough
Hey now, Hey now
You know these love letters mix with whisky
Just don't light a match when you kiss me
Though I'll blow away, you know I'll be back soon
Hey now, Hey now, Hey now, am I talking just a little too loud
There's no love, there's no hate
I left them there for you to take
But, know that every word was a piece of my heart
Have I said too much
Maybe I haven't said enough
But know that every word was a piece of my heart
Hey now, am I talking just a little too proud
Hey now, the night's just bringing me downEmbed
