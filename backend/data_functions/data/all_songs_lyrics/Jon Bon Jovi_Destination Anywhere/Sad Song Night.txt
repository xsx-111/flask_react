Sad Song Night LyricsShe was a little bit older
I was a little bit shy
But Iknew how to kiss
Her lips with mine
Whiskey breath and cigarettes
There's smell perfume and that's as good as it gets
She taught me how to dance in a Spanish town
She got a kick out of watching me spin round and round
Stars shawn bright and the moon hung low
Willie DeVille singing on the radio
Well it's a sad song night
With a long ago girl running through my mind
It's a sad song night
Ain't nothing stops time like a sad song night
Sad song night
She came in the room, wild flowers in her hair
She lit the way with a hundred candles up the stairs
We made love in a Chinese lantern room
Ain't it a bitch it had to end so soon
Well it's a sad song night
With a long ago girl running through my mind
It's a sad song night
Ain't nothing stops time like a sad song
It's a sad song night
With a long ago girl running through my mind
Another sad song night
Ain't nothing stops time like a sad song night
Well I never went back to the Spanish town
Hung up my dancing shows
And the world kept on spinning round and round
I think of her when they play that song
Sometimes I even sing along...
Well it's a sad song night
With a long ago girl running through my mind
It's a sad song night
Ain't nothing stops time like a sad song
It's a sad song night
With a long ago girl running through my mind
Another sad song night
Ain't nothing stops time like a sad song
It's a sad song night
It's a sad song night
Sad song night
Sad song nightEmbed
