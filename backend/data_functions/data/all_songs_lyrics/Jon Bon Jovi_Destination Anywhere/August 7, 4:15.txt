August 7, 4:15 Lyrics
It was another day
A perfect Texas afternoon
A mother and two children
Play the way they always do
As they raced home from the mailbox
A mother and her son
Against a little girl of six years old
The independent one
The deputies went door to door
Through all the neighborhood
They said I got some news to tell you, folks
I'm afraid it ain't so good
Somehow something happened
Someone got away
Someone got the answers
For what happened here today
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, no, no, no

Tell me it was just a dream
August 7, 4:15
God closed His eyes
And the world got mean
August 7, 4:15
Now the people from the papers
And the local TV news
Tried to find the reason
Cop dogs sniffed around for clues
Someone shouted "Hit & run"
The coroner cried "Foul'"
Her blue dress was what she wore
The day they laid her body down
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, no, no, no


I know tonight
That there's an angel
Up on Heaven's highest hill
And no one there can hurt you, baby
No one ever will
Somewhere
Someone's conscience
Is like a burning bed
The flames are all around you
How you gonna sleep again?
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, no, no, no
