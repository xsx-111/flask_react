Destination Anywhere LyricsHey Babe, it's me i'm parked outside your house
I know that he's asleep, so listen to me now
Darlin' I'm tired of living just in your dreams
I'm getting out
You know we both sold our souls
We're just growing old, in this sleepy, dead-end town
Destination Anywhere
Name the place and I'll be there
Pack a bag and we're out of here, let's run
Baby, we both been running uphill for too long
We both settled for something got nothing
And we both know thats wrong
Go and admit it we lived it, I'm leaving
Get your boots and come on
I got my coat and my keys
I need you next to me, then I'm gone
Destination Anywhere
Name the place and I'll be there
Pack a bag and we're out of here, let's run
Destination Anywhere
Left or right, I don't care
Baby we'll just disappear like the sun
When these wheels spin, baby they can all eat our dust
As far as I'm concerned, this whole town lost its nut
We won't be here when they put us down
It's our big chance I'm calling you now
They never let us go unless we try
I'm tired of living just to die
We're getting out of here, Destination Anywhere
Destination Anywhere
Name the place and I'll be there
Pack a bag and we're out of here, let's run
Destination Anywhere
Left or right, I don't care
Maybe we'll just disappear like the sun
Come on, come on, come onEmbed
