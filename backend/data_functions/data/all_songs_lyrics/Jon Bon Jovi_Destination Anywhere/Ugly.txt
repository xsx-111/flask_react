Ugly LyricsIf you're ugly, I'm ugly too
In your eyes the sky's a different blue
If you could see yourself like others do
You'd wish you were as beautiful as you, Yeah
And I wish I was a camera sometimes
So I could take your picture with my mind
I'd put it in a frame for you to see
How beautiful you really are to me
Ugly, Ugly, all of us
Just feel like that somedays
Ain't no rainbow in the sky
When you feel U.G.L.Y
And that's Ugly
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah. Yeah, Yeah
Ugly, Ugly, all of us
Just feel like that somedays
Ain't no rainbow in the sky
When you feel U.G.L.Y
And that's Ugly, Ugly, all of us
Just feel like that somedays
Ain't no cure that you can buy
When you feel U.G.L.Y
And that's Ugly
So if you're ugly, I'm ugly too
If you're a nut then I must be a screw
If you could see yourself the way I do
You'd wish you were as beautiful as you
Yeah
I wish I was as beautiful as youEmbed
