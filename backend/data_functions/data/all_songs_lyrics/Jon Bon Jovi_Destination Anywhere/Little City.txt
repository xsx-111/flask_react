Little City LyricsI got my call light on
Gimme one more fare tonight
Just get me over the bridge
I can see those shiny bay lights
You know I'm never alone
But I'm feeling lonely tonight
Damn, I got my last cigarette
But I ain't got not light
God let these wheels roll
To where the girls are pretty
When the nights explode
And life is still living
Down this open road
The arms of pity
Wait to greet me tonight in little city
In my rear view mirror
I see someone else's hairline
I hear that fire in your eyes
Is on the rock and doing hard time
And the grapes of wrath, they're on the vine
There's wine in this dirt
Here love ain't love
It's just another four letter word
God let these wheels roll
To where the girls are pretty
When the nights explode
And life is still living
Down this open road
The arms of pity
Wait to greet me tonight in little city
Now that cold gray fog's
Just a rolling down the highway
He's come to carry me home
It's put a little smile on my faceEmbed
