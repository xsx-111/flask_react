Novelty Lyrics
When the people listen to you, don't you know it means a lot?
Because you've got to work so hard for everything you've got
Can't rest on your laurels now - not when you've got none
You'll find yourself in the gutter, right back where you came from

Someone told me being in the know is the main thing
We all need the security that belonging brings
Can't stand on your own in these times against all the odds
You all just fall behind like all the other sods


You slap our backs and pretend you knew about
All the things that we were gonna do
What you're gonna do?
What you're gonna do when it's over?

You're all on your own now - don't you think that it's a shame?
But you're the only one responsible to take the blame
So what you're gonna do when the novelty is gone?
Yeah, what you're gonna do when the novelty is gone?

You slap our backs and pretend you knew about
All the things that we were gonna do
What you're gonna do?
What you're gonna do when it's over?2Embed
