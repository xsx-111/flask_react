Failures Lyrics
Don't speak of false messiahs
Failure of the modern man
To the center of all life's desires
As a whole not an also ran

Love in a hollow field
Break the image of your father's son
Drawn to an inner feel
He was thought of as the only one

He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
He no longer pick sides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man

Wise words and sympathy
Tell the story of our history
New strength gives a real touch
Sense and reason make it all too much

With a strange fatality
Break the spirits of a lesser man
Some other race can see
In his way he was the only one

He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
No, no, he can't pick sides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man

Now that it's right to decide
In his time he was a total man
Taken from Caesar's side
Kept in silence just to prove who's wrong

No, no he canâ€™t despise
All the failures of the Modern Man
No, no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
