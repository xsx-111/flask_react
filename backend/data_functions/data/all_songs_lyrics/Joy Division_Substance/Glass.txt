Glass Lyrics
Hearts fail
Young hearts fail
Anytime, pressurised
Overheat, overtired
Take it quick, take it neat
Clasp your hands, touch your feet
Take it quick, take it neat
Take it quick, take it neat

Hearts fail
Young hearts fail
Anytime, wearing down
On the run, underground
Put your hand where it's safe
Leave your hand where it's safe
Do it again
Do it again and again and again
Do it again and again and again
Do it again and again and again
Do it again and again and again

Anytime, that you're right
Don't you wish you'd do it again?
Overheat, overtired
Don't you wish you'd do it again?
Don't you wish you'd do it again?
Don't you wish you'd do it again?
Anytime, that's you're right
Don't you wish you'd do it again?
Anytime, that's you're right
Don't you wish you'd do it again?
Don't you wish you'd do it again?
Bet you wish you'd do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again1Embed
