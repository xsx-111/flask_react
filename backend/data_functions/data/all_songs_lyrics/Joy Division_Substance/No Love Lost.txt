No Love Lost Lyrics

So long sitting here, didn't hear the warning
Waiting for the tape to run
We've been moving around in different situations
Knowing that the time would come
Just to see you torn apart
Witness to your empty heart

I need it
I need it
I need it

Through the wire screen
The eyes of those standing outside looked in at her
As into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo
In the hand of one of the assistants
She saw the same instrument
Which they had that morning
Inserted deep into her body
She shuddered instinctively
No life at all in the house of dolls
No love lost
No love lost
You've been seeing things in darkness, not in learning
Hoping that the truth will pass
No life underground, wasting never changing
Wishing that this day won't last
To never see you show your age
To watch until the beauty fades

I need it
I need it
I need it1Embed
