From Safety to Where...? Lyrics
No I don't know just why
No I don't know just why
Which way to turn
I got this ticket to use

Through childlike ways rebellion and crime
To reach this point and retreat back again
The broken hearts
All the wheels that have turned
The memories scarred and the vision is blurred

No I don't know which way
Don't know which way to turn
The best possible use

Just passing through, until we reach the next stage
But just to where, well it's all been arranged
Just passing through but the break must be made
Should we move on or stay safely away?

Through childlike ways rebellion and crime
To reach this point and retreat back again
The broken hearts
All the wheels that have turned
The memories scarred and the vision is blurred
Just passing through, until we reach the next stage
But just to where, well it's all been arranged
Just passing through but the break must be made
Should we move on or stay safely away?1Embed
