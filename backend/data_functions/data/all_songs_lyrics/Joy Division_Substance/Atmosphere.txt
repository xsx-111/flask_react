Atmosphere Lyrics
Walk in silence
Don't walk away, in silence

See the danger, always danger
Endless talking, life rebuilding
Don't walk away

Walk in silence
Don't turn away, in silence

Your confusion, my illusion
Worn like a mask of self-hate, confronts and then dies
Don't walk away

People like you find it easy
Naked to see, walking on air
Hunting by the rivers, through the streets, every corner
Abandoned too soon, set down with due care

Don't walk away, in silence
Don't walk away18Embed
