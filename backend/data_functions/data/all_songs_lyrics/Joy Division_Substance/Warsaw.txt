Warsaw Lyrics
Three, five, zero, one, two, five, go

I was there in the back stage
When first light came around
I grew up like a changeling
To win the first time around
I can see all the weakness
I can pick all the faults
Well I concede all the faith tests
Just to stick in your throats

31G, 31G, 31G

I hung around in your soundtrack
To mirror all that you've done
To find the right side of reason
To kill the three lies for one
I can see all the cold facts
I can see through your eyes
All this talk made no contact
No matter how hard we tried
31G, 31G, 31G

I can still hear the footsteps
I can see only walls
I slid into your man-traps
With no hearing at all
I just see contradiction
Had to give up the fight
Just to live in the past tense
To make believe you were right

31G, 31G, 31G

Three, five, zero, one, two, five5Embed
