Ewan LyricsYou've spent some time in the morning sun
But what goes up must come down
And you can feel the sunshine fading
And it's too soon but you're stuck waiting
It's painful 'cause you just won't let go
One mouthful and you want more
When you've felt so fine you just can't fake it
When nothing comes you catch and break it
'Cause you can feel the sunshine fading
And it's too soon but you're stuck waiting
And you can feel the sunshine fading
And it's too soon but you're stuck waiting
When you've felt so fine you just can't fake it
When nothing comes you catch and break it1Embed
