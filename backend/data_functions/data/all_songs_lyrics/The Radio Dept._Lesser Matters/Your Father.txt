Your Father LyricsThe fire caught us burning with desire to get out in the open
My daddy had a camera and he caught a few moments to show them
The fire took us higher we were hoping to expire
When you came in with water, with water
We were only kids when we first laid eyes on each other
Everything was great but you should have warned me about your father
At first he took the crap but I soon learned not to even bother
With your father, with your father
Now that you're away I'm jerking off every day to your memory
You finding someone else was a real blow, who will defend me?
I'm drinking every day but try to behave the same way
I did before but it's hard, it's, oh, so hard
We were only kids when we first laid eyes on each other
Everything was great but you should have warned me about your father
At first he took the crap but I soon learned not to even bother
With your father, with your father1Embed
