Against the Tide LyricsFalling against what you know, falling against the tide
Falling against what you know, falling against the tide
Oh what you want, is it what you want, is it what you want?
Is this what you want? Is this what you want?
Is this what you want? Because we are young
And things are wrong, we'll lose the chains
We'll make things right before the sun goes down on
And out of sight we'll lose the chains
'Cause you and I, we move against the tide
Falling against what you know, falling against the tide
Falling against what you know, falling against the tide
Oh what you want, is it what you want, is it what you want?
Is this what you want? Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?Embed
