1995 Lyrics1995 is missing buses
It's walking 15 miles to see your love
It's knowing you're alive through all the fuzz
It's never coming down from going up
1995 is cutting classes
It's sitting over coffees talking indie treats
It's the mere sensation of being the first one
That you see when morning opens up the skies
You see me when daylight opens up your eyes
1995, and though I'm happier now I always long somehow
And though I'm happier now I always long somehow
And though I'm happier now I always long somehow back to 1995
All my friends have different plans to make their lives worthwhile
Some for the better, some for worse
Some have gone to different cities searching every mile
For missing pieces that will make a whole
1995 seems like a long way to go
If you ever were to find your way back home
The only thing I really miss is being the first one
That you see when morning opens up the skies
You see me when daylight opens up your eyes
That's where I came alive
And though I'm happier now I always long somehow
And though I'm happier now I always long somehow
And though I'm happier now I always long somehow back to 19951Embed
