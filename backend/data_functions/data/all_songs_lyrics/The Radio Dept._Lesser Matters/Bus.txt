Bus LyricsYou need to take that bus, goodbyes aren't all that good
Mother is in a mess, what are you gonna do if nothing happens?
Nothing happens, nothing happens
Nothing happens around here any more
Leaving the girls behind, goodbyes aren't all that good
Daddy says you'll be fine but what is he gonna say if nothing happens?
Nothing happens, nothing happens
Nothing happens around here any more1Embed
