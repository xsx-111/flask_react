Spray Lyrics(Instrumental 0:00 - 6:12)
Now when he was away
The walking out was walking out
With all the tall little ways
Just don't know what it's like
Just don't know where am I
Just don't know where I'm going
I was going all the time
Just don't know you can rise
Just breaking wrong and right
The stone there down is going
Go away tonight
Just don't know when you're right
When I'm down, alright
Just don't know where you are
Just don't know you are there
Just don't know where you are
Where you run, the water run
Just don't know where you go
Where you're running out
Just where you take a rest
And where the harvest
Don't know where you're outEmbed
