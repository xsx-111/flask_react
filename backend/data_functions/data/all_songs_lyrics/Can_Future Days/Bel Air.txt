Bel Air LyricsAnd when nobody can say that you hate
But then your story made the store right now
And when you started to say that you hate
You're coming down to the start up gown
And then this party, you just stay that you hide
You're coming down to just start running down
And when nobody you're just shredding his head
You're coming down to the start up gown
Spinning down alone, spinning down alone
Spinning down alone, you spin alive
Spinning down alone, spinning down alone
Spinning down alone, you spin alive
Spinning down alone, spinning down alone
Spinning down alone, you spin alive
Spinning down alone, spinning down alone
Spinning down alone, you spin alive
Spinning down alone, spinning down alone
Spinning down alone, you spin alive
Spinning down alone, spinning down alone
Spinning down alone, you spin alive
When it's down alone, when it's down alone
When it's down alone you spin alive
It's down, breaking down where it's all alone
It's down, breaking down where it's all alone
But it's the dying
The down breaking wall where it's all tonight
It's down, breaking down where it's all tonight
But just the dying, oh yeah
Coming down to this speeding life
You're coming down to this waiting goal
Making down to this speeding life
I'm breaking down to this walking goal
Coming down to this speeding life
You're coming down to this waiting goal
Making down to this speeding life
I'm breaking down to this walking goal
Breaking down, you know, speaking down, you know
Waking down, you know, you spin alive
Breaking down, you know, speaking down, you know
Waking down, you know, you spin alive
Breaking down, you know, speaking down, you know
Waking down, you know, you spin alive
Breaking down, you know, speaking down, you know
Waking down, you know, you spin aliveEmbed
