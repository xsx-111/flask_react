Let Yourself Go Lyrics
Rain on the river, I'm soaking wet
Waiting on a friend who ain't come yet
And he might not get here for three or four days
Got to make a little bit go a long way

I've got a blond-headed woman who likes to come around
Cute little hippy girl lives in town
Brings a bag of records and she plays 'em 'til dawn
Give me little loving then she got to go home

When times are hard
When you start feeling low
Let yourself go
When the river's rising
And the world feels cold
Let yourself go
Let yourself go

I got a 442 sittin' in the sun
Well it'd been ten years since she used to run
Man, she was a beauty in '69
But there ain't no more coming down the line
When times are hard
And you start feeling low
Let yourself go
When the river's rising
And your world feels cold
Let yourself go
Honey, let yourself go
Let yourself goEmbed
