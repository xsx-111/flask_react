I Should Have Known It Lyrics
I shoulda known it, I shoulda seen
Leave it to you to treat me mean
Every promise was just a runaround
I shoulda known it, yeah, you're gonna let me down

Well, it's over now, you see
That's the last time you're gonna hurt me

I shoulda known it, hard to believe
It was all right there in front of me
Sold down the river, left for dead
Yeah, you're putting ideas in another man's head

Well, it's over now, you see
That's the last time you're gonna hurt me

Thanks for nothing, yeah, thanks a lot
Go ahead, baby, take all I got

And it's over now, ya see
That's the last time you're gonna hurt me
Yeah
That's the last time you're gonna hurt meEmbed
