Jefferson Jericho Blues LyricsWell poor Tom Jefferson, he loved the little maid out back
Midnight creeping out to the servant's shack
Kept a secret under the bed wrapped in a burlap sack
Well, I drove all day and night out to Jericho
But in my second mind, I knew it was time to go
Yeah and I still get nervous every time that bugle blows
Well she ain't no good for me, but I just can't let go
If I sit here thinking, my thoughts will overflow
And I can't keep from crying, can't keep time from moving slowEmbed
