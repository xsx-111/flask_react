Good Enough Lyrics
She was hell on her mama
Impossible to please
She wore out her daddy
Got the best of me
And there's something about her
That only I can see
And that's good enough

You're barefoot in the grass
And you're chewing sugarcane
You got a little buzz on
You're kissing in the rain
And if a day like this
Don't ever come again
Well that's good enough

Good enough for me
Good enough for right now (yeah)
Good enough for me
Good enough for right now (yeah)
(Instrumental interlude)
God bless this land
God bless this whiskey
I can't trust love
It's far too risky
If she marries into money
She's still going to miss me
And that's good enough
Gonna have to be good enough
