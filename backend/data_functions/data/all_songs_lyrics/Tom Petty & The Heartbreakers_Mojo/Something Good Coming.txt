Something Good Coming LyricsI'm watching the water
Watching the coast
Suddenly I know
What I want the most
And I want to tell you
Still I hold back
I need some time
Get my life on track
I know that look on your face
But there's something lucky about this place
And there's something good coming
For you and me
Something good coming
There has to be
And I'm thinking about mama
And about the kids
And the way we lived
And the things we did
How she never had a chance
Never caught a break
And how we pay for our big mistakes
I know so well the look on your face
And there's something lucky about this place
There's something good coming
Just over the hill
Something good coming
I know it will
And I'm in for the long run
Wherever it goes
Riding the river
Wherever it goes
And I'm an honest man
Work's all I know
You take that away
Don't know where to go
And I know that look that's on your face
There's something lucky about this place
There's something good coming
For you and me
Something good coming
There has to beEmbed
