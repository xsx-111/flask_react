Candy LyricsI sure like that candy
I don't go for them turnip greens
I sure like that candy
I don't go for them turnip greens
So when you put it on the table
Oh mama think about me
Well I don't drink Coca Cola
But I sure like the old moonshine
Well I don't drink Coca Cola
But I sure like the old moonshine
Yeah we drink it from a fruit jar
With my little baby by my side
Well I don't much like walking
But I love my Eldorado ride
I ain't never cared a thing about walking
But I love my Eldorado ride
Yeah we run it round the cornfield
With my little baby by my side
(Chorus)Embed
