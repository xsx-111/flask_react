First Flash Of Freedom Lyrics
On our first flash of freedom
I called out your name
Love, it is hard, like an overdue train
We felt so much more
Than our hearts could explain
On our first flash of freedom

A fistful of glory, a suitcase of sin
The language you dream in
When you count to ten
You go to the edge
And you always give in
On your first flash of freedom

Down every canyon and mountain we fall
We laugh at our shadows
Tall on the wall
Your brain is so full
But you can't keep it all
On your first flash of freedom

Across ancient bridges
Through a town with no name
Across painted hills
That no rich man can claim
Run the wild mustangs
That nothing could tame
On your first flash of freedom
On your first flash of freedomEmbed
