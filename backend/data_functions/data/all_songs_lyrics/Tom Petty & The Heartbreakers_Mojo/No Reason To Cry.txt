No Reason To Cry LyricsAll I'm wanting is to see you
And to hold you once again
And see the sun color your hair
And see the tall grass blow in the wind
Overcome me, bitter sweetness
Put me under a magic spell
Overcome me, all my sadness
Lead me on and wish me well
There's no reason to cry
There's no reason to cry
It's alright
So overtake me, my sweet lover
Let me kiss your honey lips
Could be the only thing that's real
Could be when you get sad your memory slips
(Chorus)Embed
