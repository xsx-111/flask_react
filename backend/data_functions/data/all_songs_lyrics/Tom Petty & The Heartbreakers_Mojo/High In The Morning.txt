High In The Morning LyricsBoy that bottle belongs to the devil
Better leave it on the shelf
Could be the old man wants it for himself
(Chorus)
Boy that woman belongs to the captain
Better let her go her way
Before the captain got something to say
(Chorus)
Boy that power belongs to the devil
Better leave that power alone
Could be the devil gonna want it for his own
Well it hurts my heart to see a young man fall
Hurt me to my bones
To see him high in the morning and by evening
See him gone
To see him high in the morning and by evening
See him goneEmbed
