U.S. 41 LyricsMy daddy came a-marching
Over the hill at dawn
Had to make that wage, man
That's how we got along
My daddy's life was working
Working all day long
Put food on the table
And the children sang a song
Yes, the children sang a song
My grandad's name was Parkwood
Wore a coat of green
Took a wife in '31
Drove the big machine
My daddy load the lumber
Put it on the truck
Used to see him walking home on U.S. 41
That's right, U.S. 41
All my life's been working
Out the door and gone
Got to make that overtime
Keep us moving on
Need a drink of water
To get out of the sun
Burning up to make that wage on U.S. 41
That's right, U.S. 41
The boss man owns the business
Keeps it going strong
Blowing like a hurricane
And work like nothing's wrong
We got to keep on moving
Until the bell gon' ring
Fill her up with kerosene
And let that lady sing
Whoa now, let that lady sing
His given name was Lucky
His wife's name Annie Brown
Run outside the law
And they chased him right on down
Lucky faced the lawman
The captain drew his gun
They cut him with a sling blade
On U.S. 41
That's right, U.S. 41Embed
