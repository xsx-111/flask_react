Charade (Fern Prairie) Lyrics
Huge flowing movements
Crashing footsteps
Beautiful strangeness
Earth trembles
Forest edge trees in motion
Sun is gathered
Two hundred, two
Hundred million years ago
Forest edge trees in motion (sun is gathered)
Is gathered
Two hundred million (million years ago)
Huge flowing movements
Crashing footsteps
Beautiful strangeness
Earth trembles under forest edge
Come into vast open view with you (with you)
We see with love eyes our home for now (our home for now)
Turn in slow circles to see all around (around)
Turn and see all around

Sun is gathered
Two hundred, two
Trembles under forest edge
Come into vast open view with you (with you)
We see with love eyes our home for now (our home for now)
Turn in slow circles to see all around
Turn and see all aroundEmbed
