Illusion (Fern Lake) Lyrics
(Mor)ning be(gins in)side the flow(er
An) abundance (of new) life e(mer)ges
Each (hour on) land, in wat(er and) air
Inside (morning) begins

(Mor)ning be(gins in)side the flow(er
An) abundance (of new) life e(mer)ges
Each (hour on) land, in wat(er and) air
Inside (morning) begins

Circles of eggs in mud-mound nests
With gentleness are protected inside
Warm underneath rotting leaf heat
The mystery is all around us continuously
(Smaller lands drifting continuously)

Circles of eggs in mud-mound nests
With gentleness are protected inside
Warm underneath rotting leaf heat
The mystery is all around us continuously
(Smaller lands drifting continuously)
(Mor)ning be(gins in)side the flow(er
An) abundance (of new) life e(mer)ges
Each (hour on) land, in wat(er and) air
Inside (morning) beginsEmbed
