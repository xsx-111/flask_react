Birth of the Flower (Seagreen) Lyrics
Silhouette in white sun
Suddenly the sight of
Color everywhere
A flower whispers in your ear

The story of its origin
Near Sundance Sea
I see your listening
Your Look with me
And all I see is new
A flower’s scent
Changes our path
Songs of birds
Describe the light
In the presence
And absence of light
Butterflies wind
Around each other as they rise
We see a
A beauty
Only we (we have seen)
I see it in you, you see it in me

We see a beauty only we have seen
I see it in you, you see it in meEmbed
