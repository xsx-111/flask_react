New Forest (Five Heads of the Sun) Lyrics
Through distances of green
We move toward the sound
Is this moment as it seems
Always something is hidden
The ground’s pulse
What time is here
Everything feels close
Something always is about to appear

You said, you said, I can’t imagine –
What about now
Dear one, dear one, I can’t imagine – about now

Through distances of green
We move toward the sound
Is this moment as it seems
Always something is hidden
The ground’s pulse
What time is here
Everything feels close
Something always is about to appear

You said, you said, I can’t imagine –
What about now
Dear one, dear one, I can’t imagine – about now
In the rain see a new forest rise
Hand over heart at the sight
What, dear one, about now

You said, you said, I can’t imagine –
What about now
Dear one, dear one, I can’t imagine – about now1Embed
