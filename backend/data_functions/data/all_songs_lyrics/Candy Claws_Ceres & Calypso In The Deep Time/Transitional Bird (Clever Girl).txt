Transitional Bird (Clever Girl) Lyrics
Layers of green above
Where is the beginning
Sun rising tries to catch
A glimpse
Of forest floor a branch (black feathered wings)
Falling through air (ready to jump)
On sudden sound of wind begin to soar

Transitional bird
When we hear –
We make a listening sound

Moon rising exchanges
Secrets with the leaves
Sitting with you in a tree
In soft rain feeling there’s
Time here for everything
On sudden sound of wind begin to soar

Transitional bird
When we hear –
We make a listening sound
Transitional bird
When we hear –
We make a listening sound
Transitional bird
When we hear –
We make a listening soundEmbed
