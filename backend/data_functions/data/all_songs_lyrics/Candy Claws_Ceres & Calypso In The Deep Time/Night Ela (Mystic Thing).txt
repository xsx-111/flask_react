Night Ela (Mystic Thing) Lyrics
Hiding beneath a leaf
Listening to strange calls
The space around us
Grows vast the closer we are
Hiding beneath a leaf
Listening to strange calls
The space around us
Grows vast the closer we are

Night fills in the spaces
Around the forest
The gentle give of your whisper
What about now
Night fills in the spaces
Around the forest
The gentle give of your whisper
What about now

Hiding beneath a leaf
Listening to strange calls
The space around us
Grows vast the closer we are
Hiding beneath a leaf
Listening to strange calls
The space around us
Grows vast the closer we are
Night fills in the spaces
Around the forest
The gentle give of your whisper
What about now
Night fills in the spaces
Around the forest
The gentle give of your whisper
What about now

Foghorn, trombone, trumpet
From bright color crest

Night fills in the spaces
Around the forest
The gentle give of your whisper
What about now
Night fills in the spaces
Around the forest
The gentle give of your whisper
What about nowEmbed
