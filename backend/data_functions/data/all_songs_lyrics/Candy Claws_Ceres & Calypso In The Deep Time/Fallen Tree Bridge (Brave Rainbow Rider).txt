Fallen Tree Bridge (Brave Rainbow Rider) Lyrics
Fall asleep up high on moss
Covered fallen tree bridge
Water opens slowly

Land drifts apart in dreams
Morning singing, you weave

Tree sound in wind
Or is it the sound of water

Land drifts apart in dreams
Morning singing, you weave
Your hand through the sunbeam
Land drifts apart in dreams

Fall asleep up high on moss
Covered fallen tree bridge
Water opens slowly

Land drifts apart in dreams
Morning singing, you weave
Your hand through the sunbeam
Land drifts apart in dreams
(Follow it to where a mountain is beginning)Embed
