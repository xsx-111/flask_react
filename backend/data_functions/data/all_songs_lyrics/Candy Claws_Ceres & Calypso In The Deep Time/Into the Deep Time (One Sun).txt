Into the Deep Time (One Sun) Lyrics
Wild wind, hidden lands
Parched riverbeds, harsh desert land
We listen for the waterâ€™s edge (we listen for the edge)
Earth recovering
Twenty million years
In silent time
Strange new life (strange new life)
Will appear
North and South Poles
Green flow of trees
Lands drifting toward water
Lands drifting toward land
Earth recovering
Twenty million years
In silent time
Strange new life (strange new life)
Will appear1Embed
