White Seal (Shell & Spine) Lyrics
Stay near the water in Middle Life
See shallow sea coral reefs rise
It’s the hot bright sunshine
I write our names in the sand
Gather sea urchin shells and spines

Breathe deep, huge sea creatures glide
White Seal, like an arrow you fly
Be brave, there’s no need to hide
Be brave, there’s no need to hide

From tiny island to tiny island
A giant turtle offers you a ride
It’s the hot bright sunshine
Be brave, there’s no need to hide

Day is made for us to be amazed
A new adventure always ours to find
My dear one, here in the deep time
Here in the deep time

Breathe deep, huge sea creatures glide
White Seal, like an arrow you fly
Be brave, there’s no need to hide
Be brave, there’s no need to
Here in the deep time
Be brave, there’s no need to hide1Embed
