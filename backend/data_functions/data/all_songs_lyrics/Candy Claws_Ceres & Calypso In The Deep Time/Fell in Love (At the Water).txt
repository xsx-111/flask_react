Fell in Love (At the Water) Lyrics
Zigzag of dragonflies
Deep rises of light in uneven wings
Brown and green
Shallow stream
New sudden life arrives
(At the edge to drink)

Red clay-colored
Clouds low
Ferns, gingkoes, cycads
Horsetail reed beds
Many places the wind finds
A music is easily made

Red clay-colored (Zigzag of dra...)
Clouds low (...gonflies)
Ferns, gingkoes cycads (Deep rises of light...)
Horsetail reed beds (...in uneven...)
Many places the wind finds (...wings, brown and green, shallow stream)
A music is easily made (New sudden life arrives)
