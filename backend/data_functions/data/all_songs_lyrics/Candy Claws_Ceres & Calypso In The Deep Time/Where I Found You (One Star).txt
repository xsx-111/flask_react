Where I Found You (One Star) Lyrics
Spectacular sky
Shooting stars
Immeasurable wings
We could not look away
To see the other see
Crackle of volcano, lava flow
Ash-cloud lightning flash
We were so (we were so)
Far from home
Bright colored sail on land
How many times wide-eyed
Did we hide, climbing high as a sound
Like thunder made everything
Tremble
I held your moss-covered stone
And the sun disappeared
As I watched you return
From the rising waterâ€™s edgeEmbed
