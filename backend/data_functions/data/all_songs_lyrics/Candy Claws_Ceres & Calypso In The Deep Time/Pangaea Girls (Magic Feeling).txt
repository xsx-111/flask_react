Pangaea Girls (Magic Feeling) Lyrics
I carve a heart around a C (around a C)
On the trunk of the tallest tree

In the deep time
I’m a leaf-shaped shadow
You’re the sun
Dear one

I would miss so much of the world (much of the world)
Without the way and all you see

In the deep time
I’m a leaf-shaped shadow
You’re the sun
Dear one

In the deep time
I’m a leaf-shaped shadow
You’re the sun
Dear one
I would miss so much of the world
Without the way and all you see

In the deep time
I’m a leaf-shaped shadow
You’re the sun1Embed
