Lost Out in the Darkness LyricsIf you love me,please tell me
I've gotta feel that word between us
If you need me, don't sell me
If I see the black dog it's gonna kill me
And in the morning when you rise
Bruised blue throwing ashes on the water
It's a strange, sweet kind of light
To be lost out in the darkness of the border
I've been waiting for you patiently
I'm trying to be hopeful for you, brother
Hey there, hangman: Wait for me
Can you give my number to another?
And in the morning when you rise
Bruised blue throwing ashes on the water
It's a strange, sweet kind of life
To be lost out in the darkness of the border
If you carry the good news, show me
I've been looking for a song down among us
When the poets called for gasoline
I knew my days in the kingdom
Were numbered
And in the morning when you rise
Bruised blue throwing ashes on the water
It's a strange, sweet kind of life
To be lost out in the darkness of the borderEmbed
