Jaw LyricsYou found me that night
Looking for a way out
What you asked of me
Felt like surrender somehow
Does the moon in Cancer
Give quarter to the night?
Yes, I have a song - it's easy to write
I don't really mind how you say it
It's there in the moment
Every moment
But can we make it?
I don't really mind
But mark the way that we're changing
It's there in the motion
Every notion
Still fading
It's there in the jawline
Of my son and my daughter
It's the way that I testify
About my mother and father
It's the way that I rise with my partner
So no more dancing
Like the world's whipped forever
I don't really mind how you say it
It's there in the moment
Every moment
But can we make it?
I don't really mind
But mark the way that we're changing
It's there in the motion
Every notion
Still fadingEmbed
