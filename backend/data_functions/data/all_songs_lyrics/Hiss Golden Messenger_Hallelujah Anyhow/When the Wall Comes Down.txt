When the Wall Comes Down LyricsWhat'cha gonna do
When the wall comes down
When the wall comes down
What you oughta do
Is let it lie
Let it lie
And in the gathering darkness vow
To never go back
It was built by man and you can tear it down
Tear it down
Tear it down
Step back, Jack, from the darkness
What'cha gonna do
When the shackles fall
When the shackles fall
What you oughta do
Is melt them down
Melt them down
Turn them into tools and make a garden
On the prison grounds
Turn your chains to roses, child
Tear it down
Tear it down
Step back, Jack, from the darkness
But while I'm here
I'm gonna sing just like a songbird
What'cha gonna do when the hunger's gone
When the hunger's gone
Pity the child who goes without
Goes without
Give him no reason to falter
On his way down
It's a beautiful world but painful, child
Tear it down
Tear it down
Step back, Jack, from the darkness
But while I'm here
I'm gonna sing just like a songbirdEmbed
