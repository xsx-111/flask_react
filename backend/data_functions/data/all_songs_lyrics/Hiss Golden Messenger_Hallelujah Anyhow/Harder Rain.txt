Harder Rain LyricsSo you say you want it harder
Like more than you can take
And I know you want to suffer
I've been to that place
Give it to you rougher
Like there's a debt you've got to pay
But that ain't how the world was made
And you know that, don't you?
Harder rain
Darker darkness
If it's up to me
A little love would go a long way
And you don't want it easy
Oh, babe, you know I agree
But ain't it easy just the same, babe -
All this suffering for every little thing?
And you say it want it holy
Like some prophet by the sea
That ain't how the world was made
And you know that, don't you?
Harder rain
Darker darkness
If it's up to me
A little love would go a long way
Little star of the County Down - hear me
If it feels like you're nowhere now - hear me
More pain won't kill the pain - hear me
Hear me
So you say you want it harder
Like more than you can takeEmbed
