Domino (Time Will Tell) LyricsOld SGs and cigarette smoke
Wouldn't trade it for nothing
In this whole wide world
I got nothing in the world
Old Lady Luck on the Gulfport side
Beat it from Memphis to Mobile
Running blind
Running rhymes
Domino
Time will tell
I feel like my luck is turning
Domino
If I fall
Will you bang the drum when I'm burning?
Ain't it just a funny little highway
Of moments, one after another?
Up on the roof in that early morning light
Drunk with you and my brother
I recall a time when I felt alone
Just outside of San Antone, oh no
Yes, I was such a dumb kid
But I knew I couldn't do what everybody did
Domino
Time will tell
I feel like my luck is turning
Domino
If I fall
Will you bang the drum when I'm burning?
Give me a fiddle and flat-top guitar
Give me the gospel of the jukebox
In the Lost Horse Bar
I'm smoke again
We'll be alright tonight
Domino
Time will tell
I feel like my luck is turning
Domino
If I fall
Will you bang the drum when I'm burning?Embed
