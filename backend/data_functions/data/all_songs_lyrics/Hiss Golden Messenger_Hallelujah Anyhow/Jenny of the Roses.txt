Jenny of the Roses Lyrics"I've never seen no wages of war."
That's what you told me baby
That day at the wall
"I'm gonna be a free-roving dancer."
Yes, I followed you, baby -
I was looking for the answer
Were you trying to break my mind?
Always knowing that the lights
Could change
Oh my Jenny of the Roses
You'll probably rule the world someday
Yes, then we were running
Down the King's Highway
With a ten-dollar lean
You were twenty steps in front of me
Didn't it rain?
Didn't it thunder?
O'er ribbons of highway
And you were caught under
Were you trying to break my mind?
Always knowing the at the lights
Could change
Oh my Jenny of the Roses
Let me follow you down
Where the dead river ends
Where we met before
Is where we'll meet again
And I wonder
And I wonder
"I've never been
Afraid of the darkness
It's just a different kind of light."
Were you trying to tell me something?
Didn't it rain?
Didn't it thunder?
O'er ribbons of highway
And you were caught under
Were you trying to break my mind?
Always knowing that the lights
Could change
Oh my Jenny of the Roses
Let me follow you down
Take pleasure in the rain
Down at the well
Where they all know your name
And I wonderEmbed
