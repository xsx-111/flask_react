Caledonia, My Love LyricsCaledonia, my love
Won't you come to me?
Twelve pieces of silver
And gold in your teeth
Said Good King John
Many fathoms deep
From the fire of the morning
To the blood of the evening
Caledonia, my love
Won't you come to me?
Twelve pieces of silver
And gold in your teeth
Said the wandering one
With the dark-eyed hue
He lives in wild places
And he don't love you
And all the baddest of the angels
Sit and cry for nothing
Then some die in the rushes
Caledonia, my love
Won't you come to me?
Twelve pieces of silver
And gold in your teeth
Said the mother and the father
With a child of three
Freedom ain't nothing
When you've never been free
Caledonia, my love
Won't you come to me?
Twelve pieces of silver
And gold in your teeth
Said the lonely child
Little Rosalee
Freedom ain't nothing
Unless you've been freeEmbed
