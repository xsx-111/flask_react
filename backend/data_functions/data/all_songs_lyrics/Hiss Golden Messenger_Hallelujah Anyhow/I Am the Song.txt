I Am the Song LyricsPlease send a letter, baby
I want to know if you hear
I want to know
Know know know
I want to know
I was at the Wailing Wall
White clouds singing
Hurricane ring-dancing
I want to know
Know know know
I want to know
If you've got a soul to sell
I am the song
Won't be long
Country dollar
Rhode Island Red was a sweet thing
She put sixteen dollars on Black Horse Cherry
Now no
No no no
I wanna know
If you got a soul to sell
I AM THE SONG
Won't be long
Country dollar
Did you go and break your crown?
I am the song
Won't be long
Country dollar
Yes, I see the world is changing
I had to get this message to you
Know
Know know know
I wanna knowEmbed
