John the Gun LyricsThough I'm torn and tattered
I'll abide
Baby, I swear I'll abide
I may be bruised and battered
I'm a beggar
I'm a real good dog
Yes, I was down in Bristol
Well, I was an angel under the law
Yes, now I'm outside Hazard
Where they learned to call me
John the Gun
Will you come and see me
If it's all the same?
Fading like roses
I've got so much love in me
And oh, the Sisters of Mercy
They were singing
Singing my song
In this deeply gone world, babe
I'm singing
Singing my songEmbed
