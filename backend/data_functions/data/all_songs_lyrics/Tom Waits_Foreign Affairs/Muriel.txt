Muriel LyricsMuriel, since you left town, the clubs closed down
There's one more burned-out lamppost on Main Street
Down where we used to stroll
And Muriel, I still hit all the same old haunts
And you follow me wherever I go
And Muriel, I see you on a Saturday night
In a penny arcade with your hair tied back
And the diamond twinkle is in your eye
Is the only wedding ring that I'll buy you, Muriel
And Muriel, how many times I've left this town
To hide from your memory and it haunts me
But I only get as far as the next whiskey bar
I buy another cheap cigar and I'll see you every night
Hey Muriel
Muriel
Hey buddy
Got a light?Embed
