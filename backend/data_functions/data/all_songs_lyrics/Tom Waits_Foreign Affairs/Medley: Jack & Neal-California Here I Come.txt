Medley: Jack & Neal/California Here I Come LyricsJack was sitting poker faced with bullets backed with bitches
Neal hunched at the wheel putting everyone in stitches
Bragging about some nurse he screwed while driving through Nebraska
And when she came, she honked the horn and Neal just barely missed a truck
And then he asked her if she'd like to come like that to California
You see a redhead in a uniform will always get you horny
Yeah and with her hairnet and those white shoes and a name tag and a hat
She drove like Andy Granatelli and knew how to fix a flat
And Jack was almost at the bottom of his MD 2020
Neal was yelling out the window trying to buy some bennies
From a Lincoln full of Mexicans and the left rear tire blowed
And the sons of bitches pretty near almost ran us off the road
And while the nurse had spilled the Maneshewitz all up and down her dress
And then she lit the map on fire and Neal just had to guess
Should we try and find a bootleg route or a filling station open?
The nurse was dumping out her purse and looking for an envelope
And Jack was out of cigarettes and as we crossed the yellow line
The gas pumps looked like tombstones from here
And it felt lonelier than a parking lot when the last car pulls away
And the moonlight dressed the double-breasted foothills in the mirror
Weaving out a negligee and a black brassiere
And the Mercury was running hot and we were almost out of gas
Just then Florence Nightingale. she dropped her drawers and
Stuck her fat ass halfway out of the window to a Wilson Pickett tune
And shouted "Get a load of this!" and gave the finger to the moon
Counting one-eyed Jacks and whistling "Dixie" in the car
Neal was doing least a hundred when we saw a falling star
And Florence wished that Neal would hold her instead of chewing on his cigar
Jack was nodding out and wishing he was in a bar
With Charlie Parker on the bandstand and not a worry in the world
And a glass of beer in one hand and his arms around a girl
Neal was singing to the nurse "Underneath the Harlem Moon"
And somehow you could just tell we'd be in California soon
Open up your golden gates
California, here I come
I said California, here I come
Look out California, here I comeEmbed
