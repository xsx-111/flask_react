Steve McQueen LyricsI could take my time and I can speed you up
I could pull you in, you can't get enough
Let's go slip-sliding in my veins
Cause this life is only chains
It's nothing like the colors in my dreams
I just wanted to be Steve McQueen
And my horses of English racing green
You and me in British racing green
And it could hold us down
They can break your pride
And if it gets too rough, well you just climb inside
Let's go slip-sliding in my veins
Cause this life is only chains
It's nothing like the colors in my dreams
I just want to be Steve McQueen
With my horses of English racing green
You and me in British racing green
And don't you know that you and I, we're never going home
And since we don't wanna be alone
Here we go, sliding in my veins
Cause this life is only chains
It's nothing like the colors in my dreams
And I just wanted to be Steve McQueen
With my horses of English racing green
You and me in British racing green
Cause this life is always the same
It's nothing like the colors in our dreams
We just wanted to be Steve McQueen
With our horses of English racing green
You and me in British racing green
You and me, Steve McQueenEmbed
