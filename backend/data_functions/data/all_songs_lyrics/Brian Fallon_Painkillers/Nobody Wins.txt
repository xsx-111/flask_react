Nobody Wins LyricsSkin and bones, you never did come home
Crashing on my heart through the telephone
I remember the tall grass waving
In past lives, old poems
I must have lived a lifetime without you
You must’ve ended up somebody’s angel
I remember you loving the radio
New waves, and old stones
Hey, hey little Tommy gun
I guess we’re never gonna end up the lucky ones
If I never see you again
Have a round on me love, hallelujah, nobody wins
The queen is gone, she died from a sad song
I lost most of myself pleasing everyone
I had to learn how to begin again
It’s alright, move on
Hey, hey little Tommy gun
I guess we’re never gonna end up the lucky ones
If I never see you again
Have a round on me love, hallelujah, nobody wins
(Hallelujah) But have a round on your friend
(Hallelujah) If I never see you again
(Hallelujah) Have a round on your friend
And hey, hey little Tommy gun
I guess we’re never gonna end up the lucky ones
And if I never see you again
Have a round on me love, hallelujah
And hey, hey pretty baby
I still remember you driving me crazy
And if I never see you again
Have a round on me love, hallelujah, nobody wins
(Hallelujah) And nobody wins
(Hallelujah) And nobody wins
(Hallelujah) If I never see you again
(Hallelujah) You can blame it on the windEmbed
