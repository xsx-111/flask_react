Mojo Hand LyricsI think my girl got a mojo hand
And all the boys in town want her bad
And none of us can sleep, we don't think and we can't eat
Since my girl got a mojo hand
And they all wanna turn her on
And they're climbin' through the windows and the doors
And they're crawlin' in my songs, down my halls, and in my thoughts
And they all wanna turn her on
But where would I go if you left me on my own?
Who could take your place in my soul?
I was lost when you came among the tombs, among the waves
And if you go, honey, God only knows
I never heard the horses of war
Did my eyes not see 'em comin' forward?
Did I simply wear you down, with my nerves up so loud?
I never heard the horses of war
But where would I go if you left me on my own?
Who could take your place in my soul?
I was lost when you came among the tombs, among the waves
And if you go, honey, God only knows
I think my girl caught a mojo hand
And I feel like I'll be goin' back
Back to the beat, to haunt the streets of New Orleans
Since my girl caught a mojo hand
But where would I go if you left me on my own?
Who could take your place in my soul?
I was lost where you came among the tombs, among the waves
And if you go, honey, God only knows
Oh honey, God only knows where my heart would blow
With the wind, the chilly wind in October
But here I go, like a storm
Baby, back out on my own
Think I've taken all that I can stand
Since my girl got a mojo handEmbed
