Honey Magnolia LyricsYou come here to do some desperate thing
Like I'm some fool from a film
I waited many nights, don't wait anymore, she said
But what if I did? Do you think that I been sleeping here alone
Crying, waiting on a ring?
See I don't dig those kind of blues anymore, she said
But what if I did?
Is that an invitation to use my love in your man's man's world?
But maybe I'll be the one to roll you over
I'll call when I wanna, call you honey magnolia
And I'll be the one to let you know when the sweet taste is gone
And it's over, honey magnolia
I spent so many nights just blowin' in the wind
Sleepin' in the shirt that you wore
I used to race this town, cryin' in the night, she said
I don't cry anymore
Maybe they're lining up to take you back in your man's man's world
Maybe I'll be the one to roll you over
I'll call when I wanna, call you honey magnolia
And I'll be the one to let you know when the sweet taste is gone
And it's over, honey magnolia
Maybe I'll be the one to roll you over
I'll call when I wanna, I'll call you honey magnolia
And I'll be the one to let you know when the sweet taste is gone
And it's over...
Baby, I'll the one you'll never get over
The thorn in your pride, sweet honey magnolia
And maybe I'll come, running at the end of the night
When you're older, honey magnoliaEmbed
