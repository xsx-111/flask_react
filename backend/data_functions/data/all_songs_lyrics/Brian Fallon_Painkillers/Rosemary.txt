Rosemary Lyrics
Hey!

I heard you say you don't feel right
Somethin' must've changed inside
She said, "I still love the bands and the boy down the street
But everybody else gives me the creeps"
And there's a hole in you now
Like the windshield was taken out
And everybody's hurt, and mine ain't the worst
But it's mine and I'm feelin' it now

Sometimes I think it's haunted inside this house

And I hear you cryin' over the phone
"Where have all the good times gone?"
Down in a glass of shouting matches
Lost in the songs they don't write anymore
(Hey hey hey!) It's all right
I ain't tryin' to bring you down tonight
(Hey hey hey!) Oh my, my, she says, "I don't mind"
"I'm just so tired of the empty sheets I sleep beside"

Heard you say it's gone all wrong
Since when did the days and the nights get so long?
She said, "I still miss the scene and the dying breed
But now I'd settle for some company"
And there were things that I did
Just so I could feel anything
But somewhere along, something went off
And I woke up with blood on my lips

And yeah, there were nights I just did whatever I liked

And now I hear you cryin' over the phone
"Where have all the good times gone?"
Down in a glass of shouting matches
Lost in the songs they don't write anymore
But hey hey hey, it's all right
I ain't tryin' to bring you down tonight
(Hey hey hey!) Oh my, my, she says, "I don't mind"
"I'm just so tired of the empty sheets I sleep beside"

And now I hear you cryin' over the phone
"Where have all the good times gone?"
Down in a glass of shouting matches
Lost in the songs you don't write anymore
But hey! hey! hey! It's all right (Hey Hey Hey!)
I ain't tryin' to bring you down tonight
(Hey hey hey!) And "oh my, my" she said, "I don't mind
'Cause maybe someday they're gonna love me back to life!"
(Sleep my baby, sweet Rosemary)
My name is Rosemary
(Sleep my baby, sweet Rosemary)
And you'd be lucky to meet me
(Sleep my baby, sweet Rosemary)
My name is Rosemary
(Sleep my baby, sweet Rosemary)
Yeah, you'd be lucky if you get to hold me
My name is Rosemary, and you'd be lucky to meet me1Embed
