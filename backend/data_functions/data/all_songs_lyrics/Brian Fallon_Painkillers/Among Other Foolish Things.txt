Among Other Foolish Things LyricsLily, I don't know how to start this letter
I'm writing you from the beach where I'm living
I got a disco outside of my window
I love all these kids, but the good times are killing me
I got a picture of you on the dashboard
So I can feel like you're watching right over me
I hope someday you're gonna move to the city
Cause the lights in this town, they don't brighten up anything
And they say such foolish things, like "Love, love, love, love is all you need"
But everything inside is saying 'Danger, baby, love's gonna leave'
So I played your sympathy, have mercy on me
Cause I been hurt, I been stung, by the good name of love, 'til I threw my own heart in the sea...
Among other foolish things
And I don't mind the nights and the low light
We spin 'round like records in the apartment
You still remind me of Marianne Faithfull
Lookin' like a picture taken outta the '60s
And we say such foolish things, like 'Love love love, love is all we need'
But everything inside is saying, "Danger, baby, love's gonna leave"
So I played your sympathy, be patient with me
Cause I been hurt, I been stung, by the good name of love, 'til I threw my own heart in the sea...
Among other foolish things
And we believe such foolish things, like 'Love love love, love is all we need'
And living would be easy if we never ever had to bleed
And I've taken a dive on a smoky set of eyes
I been so deceived and I've been the one lyin'
And there was this one time when I painted a masterpiece
Among other foolish thingsEmbed
