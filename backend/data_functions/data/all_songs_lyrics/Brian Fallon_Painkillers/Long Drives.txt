Long Drives LyricsI built a room for you in the back of my mind
Where the ravenous wolves and the ghosts I know reside
You were amazing, you were always on my mind
We were secrets to keep, crows buried side-by-side
But we tasted a kiss that was sent from below
It was cool in the night, I was old as a stone
In the back of a car where they try on your heart
And suddenly show you their teeth
But you say, "I’m alright
Baby, I don’t mind
I’ll get on just fine
On them long, long drives"
I keep a letter you wrote before the devil came in the picture
Says, "I've got you now, wrapped around my finger"
And into the mystic, we were blue and outrageous
And every night, I would race the moon and fall for you
But you ache for a drug that'll never be enough
You're never gonna feel like when it first picked you up
When they drove you around, bought you powder and flowers
Until the thrill was gone
And you said, "I’m alright
Baby, I don’t mind
I’ll get on just fine
On them long, long drives"
Last night I remembered being seventeen
I met a girl with a taste for the world and whiskey and Rites of Spring
Spent every night with cassettes that she liked
In a car that I borrowed a lot
I could never get her to believe
But you say, "I’m alright
Baby, I don’t mind
I’ll get on just fine
On them long, long drives"
Because I'm alright
Janey, I don't mind
I'll get on just fine
On them long, long drives without you
Without you
Without you
Drives without youEmbed
