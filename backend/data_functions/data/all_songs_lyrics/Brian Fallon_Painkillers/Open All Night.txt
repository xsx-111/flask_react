Open All Night LyricsI'm goin' back to New York City
I just can't wait no more for you
I got so lonely, sold what you gave me
'Cept that raincoat, a famous blue
And I don't need time to think about it
I don't let reminders get me down like before
But you know I used to know you
Back when local bars and broken hearts were home
And we were open all night long
Maybe I'll go out Chicago
Ain't that where the blues belong?
I heard you came by, shook up by the radio
Somethin' about the topback, wayfarers on
But I don't need time to think about it
I don't let reminders get me down like before
But you know I used to know you
Back when local bars and broken hearts were home
And we were open all night long
And all this must've been comin' a long, long time
29 years of nerves on fire
Nobody came and nobody saw
Made a wreck of myself with the headlights on
Worked these hands straight down the bone
Carried the weight until the weight took over
Ended up standing at a fork in the road with you
But I don't need time to think about it
I don't let reminders get me down like before
But you know I used to know you
Back when local bars and your crooked heart was my home, mmhmm...
And I will never know the town where you finally settled down
With the top back on a Cadillac and your sunglasses on
And you can't make me whole, I have to find that on my own
But I held you, babe, a long, long time ago
And we were open all night longEmbed
