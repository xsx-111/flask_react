A Wonderful Life LyricsMost of this life's been a drag of a high
And lows like a blow in a paid thrown title fight
Most of my sins were born in a kiss on a night like this
Calling all lonely hearts
Don't you want a life like we saw on the picture show?
So come on, give me something, come on, keep me up all night
You say, my baby, all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire, going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive, I want a wonderful life
My love seems that it goes from a dream
To a crash and a roll, just shaking up everyone
Maybe there's more than the treasures we secure
That become heavy chains, to sink us in tidal waves
And all I could do is take you from the circus show
So come on give me something, come on keep me up all night
You say, my baby, all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire, going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive, I want a wonderful life
And all my nights they always end the same (with the blacktop, blacktop)
Coming from behind
It's just the age-old game from the living dead buzzing in my head
They keep me up all night
You say, my baby, all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire, going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive, I want a wonderful life
(All my sins were born in a kiss on a night like this)
(Calling all lonely hearts)
