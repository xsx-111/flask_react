Painkillers LyricsI feel you move through this crowded room
And I catch myself like a spell fallen under you
I've been here before
Watching the wheels go round
Everybody that I've ever known
They just ache all night and they wake up alone
Yeah, we wait in the dark
For something to put us to sleep
And, oh, my dear, you never know how
'Til the things you've done come and run you down
And we want love like it was a drug
All we wanted was a little relief
And every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
And could you be to me a love supreme?
Cause we wait out this life just to hold on to anything
Cause most of the sparks are just
Sweet little cherry bombs
But oh my dear don't make a sound
'Till somebody burns you and spits you out
And we want love like it was a drug
All we wanted was a little relief
And every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
Use me up!
Use me up!
Yeah and I'll be enough
Come and use me up
Use me up!
Oh don't you love the way I drag you down?
Ain't that enough for you now?
Don't you want love like it was a drug?
Yea don't you want a little relief?
From every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
And we want love like it was a drug
Yeah all we wanted was a little relief
And every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
Come get your painkillers from meEmbed
