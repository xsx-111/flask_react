The Blue Lyrics
Shameless sea
Aimlessly so blue
Midnight-moon shines for you

Still, marooned
Silence drifting through
Nowhere to choose
Just blue

Ceaselessly
Star-crossed you and me
Save our souls
We'll be forever blue

Waves roll
Lift us in blue
Drift us
Seep right through
And colour us blue

Wait for me
Shameless you, the sea
Soon, the blue
So soon
Soon, the blue
So soonEmbed
