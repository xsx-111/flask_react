Better Off LyricsBreakin' the static, a life automatic
Everyone mad about you
Look like a dirty old bruise, face like a faded tattoo
Life imitated, it's only faded
Tired of waitin' on you
What did you want me to do, sit here and dream about
Oh no, oh no, oh no!
You know you're better off you bastard, bastard, bastard
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I'm better off you bastard, bastard, bastard
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Now that you're sane and the picture you painted
Don 't really look much like you
Little more long in the tooth, whatdya' you know about truth?
Is it there and it's just interferin', life isn't fair but I knew
What if I'm haunted by you, every time that I
Oh no, oh no, oh no!
(Chorus)
You are my favorite disaster
Finally time to clear the air
Just don't forget to breathe
Please don't forget to breathe
Everyone's better off this way
So take it away
Take it away
Take it away
(Chorus)
Just don't forget to breathe
Please don't forget to breathe
Everyone's better off this way
So take it away
Take it away
Take it away
Go!Embed
