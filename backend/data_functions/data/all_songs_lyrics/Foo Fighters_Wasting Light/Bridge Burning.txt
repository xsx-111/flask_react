Bridge Burning Lyrics
These are my famous last words!
My number's up, bridges will burn!

Oh, won't you let me twist your faith
It's gettin' kinda late and I don't wanna wait no more
Oh, may I have this dance of days
Locked in your embrace, passed your test of faith
Another time, another place
Another line upon your face, another in your way
Down crooked stairs and sideways glances
Comes the king of second chances, now throw him in the flame

Whatever keeps you warm at night
(Whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside

Your bridges are burnin' now
They're all comin' down
It's all comin' 'round
You're burnin' them down
It's all comin' 'round
They're all comin' down
Your bridges are burnin' now
Oh, let me put you in your place
Love it when you say, I'm giving everything away
Tell me what's in it for me
Tell me, now, what's in it for me
No one's gettin' this for free
So, tell me, now, what's in it for me

Whatever keeps you warm at night
(Whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside

Your bridges are burnin' now
They're all comin' down
It's all comin' 'round
You're burnin' them down
It's all comin' 'round
They're all comin' down
Your bridges are burnin' now

Gather in the ashes, everything's thrown away
Gather in the ashes, scatter as they blow away
Gather in the ashes, everything's thrown away
Gather in the ashes, scatter as they blow away
Your bridges are burnin' now
They're all comin' down
It's all comin' 'round
You're burnin' them down
It's all comin' 'round
They're all comin' down (Gather in the ashes)
Your bridges are burnin' now (Everything's thrown away)
They're all comin' down (Gather in the ashes)
It's all comin' 'round (Scatter as they blow away)
You're burnin' them down (Gather in the ashes)
It's all comin' 'round (Everything's thrown away)
They're all comin' down (Gather in the ashes)
Your bridges are burnin' now (Scatter as they blow away)13Embed
