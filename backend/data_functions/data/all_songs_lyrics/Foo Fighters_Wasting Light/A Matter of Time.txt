A Matter of Time Lyrics
Let's change the subject to someone else
You know lately, I've been subject to change
Normally, I reel in the strange
Hangover, I'm older
You're one to talk the heart is a clock
Just like a bomb that keeps on tickin' away
Counting down to detonate
You will need an army disarmin' me

It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you

It's just a matter of time, before, before
It's just a matter of time, before, before
And though I hate to rewind, before, before
It's just a matter of time

My past is getting us nowhere fast
I was never one for takin' things slow
Nowhere seems like somewhere to go
Come over and over
Doin' my time for line after line
When will I learn to sing these crimes to myself?
Prisoners to share a cell with
I'm holdin', still holdin', holdin' you in
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you

It's just a matter of time, before, before
It's just a matter of time, before, before
And though I hate to rewind, before, before
It's just a matter of time

Where the hell were you, ooh
Where the hell were you, ooh
Where the hell were you!

It's just a matter of time, before, before
It's just a matter of time, before, before
And though I hate to rewind, before, before
It's just a matter of time

What does it matter now? What does it matter now?
What does it matter now? What does it matter now?
It's just a matter of time
Time!2Embed
