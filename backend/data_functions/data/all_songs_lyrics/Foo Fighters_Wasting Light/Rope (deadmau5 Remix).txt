Rope (deadmau5 Remix) Lyrics
This indecision got me climbing up the wall
Been cheating gravity and waiting on the fall
How could this come over me? Thought I was above it all
Our hope's gone up in smoke, swallow your crown

Choke! On our kiss
I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On our kiss
I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On our kiss
I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On our kiss
I'd save my breath for you

Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some rope I'm coming out of my head...

These premonitions got me crying up a storm
Leave your condition, this position does no harm
How could this come over me, thought I was above it all
Our hope's gone up in smoke, swallow your crown
Choke! On our kiss
I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On our kiss
I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On our kiss
I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On our kiss
I'd save my breath for you

Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some rope I'm coming out of my head...Embed
