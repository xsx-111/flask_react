Back & Forth Lyrics
Once upon a time I was somebody else
In another life, I saw myself
Way back then, back when I was new
Somewhere down the line I started to slip
Years gone by, biting my lip
All the while, all this time I knew
Now, you're on your own, one for the pages
Over the hill and through the ages
Does my heaven burn like hell on you?
Out beneath the cracks and comin' in waves
Rollin' like an earthquake under the pavement
Heavy now, tell me Mr. Truth

You gotta lot of nerve, nerve
Now, show a little backbone why don't you

I'm lookin' for some back and forth with you
Are you feelin' the same as I do
Now and now and then?
I'm lookin' for some back and forth with you
Are you feelin' the same as I do?
Down and out
Holdin' my breath I waited and waited
How'd the simple life get so complicated?
Shoes to fill, secrets to spill down you
Deer in the headlights, spoke in the wheel
You want pretend I need for real
I'm takin' it back, all my IOU's

You gotta lot of nerve, nerve
Now, show a little backbone why don't you

I'm lookin' for some back and forth with you
Are you feelin' the same as I do
Now and now and then?
I'm lookin' for some back and forth with you
Are you feelin' the same as I do?
Down and out


You gotta lot of nerve, nerve
Now show a little backbone why don't you
I'm lookin' for some back and forth with you
Are you feelin' the same as I do
Now and now and then?
I'm lookin' for some back and forth with you
Are you feelin' the same as I do
Now and now and then?
I'm lookin' for some back and forth with you
Are you feelin' the same as I do
Now and now and then?
I'm lookin' for some back and forth with you
Are you feelin' the same as I do?
Down and out1Embed
