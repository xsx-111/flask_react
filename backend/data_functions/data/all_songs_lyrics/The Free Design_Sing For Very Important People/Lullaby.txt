Lullaby LyricsLittle children, close your eyes
Soon by morning sun will rise
You'll be up and on your way
Up to start another day
But for now your play must end
Time to say goodnight, my friend
No more time to run or creep
Little children, go to sleep
Little children
Go to sleep
Mm, mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Little children
Go to sleep (Little rainbow)Embed
