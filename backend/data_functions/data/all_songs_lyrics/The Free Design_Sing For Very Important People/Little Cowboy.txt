Little Cowboy LyricsLittle cowboy, you've been ridin'
Since the early mornin' sun
Findin' mavericks where they're hidin'
Ropin' dogies one by one
With your six-gun (With your six-gun) always ready (always ready)
For the bad guy (For the bad guy) strikin' you down (strikin'you down)
On your pinto strong and steady
You can run them right outta town
There's a friendly breeze always blowin'
Makin' tumbleweed tumble by
And the purple sage where it's growin'
Seems to touch the distant prairie sky
Now, it's evenin', time for sleepin'
Cattle lowin' over the rise
'Round the bunkhouse, shadows creepin' (On)
Little cowboy, close your eyes
Cowboy, close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Little cowboy, you've been ridin'
Since the early mornin' sun
Findin' mavericks where they're hidin'
Ropin' dogies one by one
With your six-gun (With your six-gun) always ready (always ready)
For the bad guy (For the bad guy) strikin' you down (strikin'you down)
On your pinto strong and steady
You can run them right outta town
There's a friendly breeze always blowin'
Makin' tumbleweed tumble by
And the purple sage where it's growin'
Seems to touch the distant prairie sky
(Close your eyes) Now, it's evenin'
(Close your eyes) Time for sleepin'
(Close your eyes) Cattle lowin'
(Close your eyes) Over the rise
(Close your eyes) 'Round the bunkhouse
(Close your eyes) Shadows creepin'
(Close your eyes) Little cowboy, close your eyesEmbed
