Love You LyricsGive a little time for the child within you
Don't be afraid to be young and free
Undo the locks and throw away the keys
And take off your shoes and socks, and run you
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Give a little time for the child within you
Don't be afraid to be young and free
Undo the locks and throw away the keys
And take off your shoes and socks, and run you
Run through the meadow and scare up the milking cows
Run down the beach kicking clouds of sand
Walk a windy weather day, feel your face blow away
Stop and listen, love you
Roll like a circus clown, put away your circus frown
Ride on a roller coaster upside down
Waltzing Matilda, Carey loves a kinkajou
Joey catch a kangaroo, hug you
Dandelion, milkweed, silky in a sunny sky
Reach out and hitch a ride and float on by
Balloons down below blooming colors of the rainbow
Red, blue and yellow-green, I love you
Bicycles, tricycles, ice cream candy
Lollipops, popsicles, licorice sticks
Solomon Grundy, Raggedy Andy
Tweedledum and Tweedledee, home free
Cowboys and indians, puppy dogs and sandpails
Beachballs and baseballs and basketballs, too
I love forget-me-nots, fluffernutters, sugar pops
I'll hug you and kiss you and love you
(Love you, love you, love you, love you)
Love you
