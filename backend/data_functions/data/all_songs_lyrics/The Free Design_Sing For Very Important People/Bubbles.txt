Bubbles LyricsBlowin' bubbles outta the window
Chewin' bubblegum and blowin' big bubbles
Gettin', gettin' ridda, ridda all my troubles
Watchin' the tadpoles glubba, glubba in the puddles
Soap bubbles carry my dreams up high
Bubblegum kinda keeps my heart from gettin' heavy and cryin', yeah
Bubblegum kinda keeps my heart from gettin' heavy and cryin'
Ma 'n' Pa are arguin' again
Today I lost my best friend
The kitty has a little cold
'N ' Grammama is getting older
My tummy has a little pain
When does Jesus come again?
Blowin' bubbles outta the window
Chewin' bubblegum and blowin' big bubbles
Gettin', gettin' ridda, ridda all my troubles
Watchin' the tadpoles glubba, glubba in the puddles
Soap bubbles carry my dreams up high
Bubblegum kinda keeps my heart from gettin' heavy and cryin', yeah
Bubblegum kinda keeps my heart from gettin' heavy and cryin'
Blowin' bubbles outta the window
Chewin' bubblegum and blowin' big bubbles
Gettin', gettin' ridda, ridda all my troubles
Watchin' the tadpoles glubba, glubba in the puddles
Soap bubbles carry my dreams up high
Soap bubbles carry my dreams up high
Soap bubbles carry my dreams up high
Bubblegum kinda keeps my heart from gettin' heavy and cryin', yeah
Bubblegum kinda keeps my heart from gettin' heavy and cryin'
Bubblegum kinda keeps my heart from gettin' heavy and cryin', yeahEmbed
