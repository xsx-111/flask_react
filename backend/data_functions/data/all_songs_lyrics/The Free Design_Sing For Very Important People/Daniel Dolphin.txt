Daniel Dolphin LyricsDaniel was a dolphin with wide innocent eyes
We met him seven years ago in an island paradise
He used to meet us at the shore, and swim with us and laugh
And show us games and coral reefs and carry us like a raft
Daniel Dolphin was a real friend
He knew more than he said
Smart as Daniel was
He used his heart before his head
No one would believe he was
As bright as what we said
No one knew he loved us
One day our grampapa was watching us play
It hurt him that we ran along and with him did not stay
And so he followed us along the sunny, sandy shore
He got so far behind us that he couldn't walk anymore
Daniel Dolphin was a real friend
He knew more than he said
Smart as Daniel was
He used his heart before his head
No one would believe he was
As bright as what we said
No one knew he loved us
There were the young ones playing
There was the old one praying
Daniel took our grampapa away through the waves
They couldn't find him anywhere in the coral reefs or caves
But three days later Daniel came, but they killed him angrily
But not before he brought to shore a tiny old brand new baby
Daniel Dolphin was a real friend
He knew more than he said
Smart as Daniel was
He used his heart before his head
No one would believe he was
As bright as what we said
No one knew he loved us
No one knew he loved usEmbed
