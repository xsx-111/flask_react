Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)  LyricsThem belly full, but we hungry
(hungry)
A hungry mob is an angry mob
(angry mob)
A rain a fall, but the dirt it tough
(dirt it tough)
A pot a cook but the food no 'nough
(food no ‘nough)
We’re going to dance to Jah music, dance
You’re going to dance to Jah music, dance
(dance to Jah music, dance)
Forget your sorrows and dance
(and dance)
Forget your troubles and dance
(and dance)
Forget your sickness and dance
(and dance)
Forget your weakness and dance
(and dance)
I’ll say, cost of living gets so high
The rich and poor they start a cry
And now the weak must get strong
They singing, Oh, what a tribulation
(oh, what a tribulation)
Singing, my belly full, but me hungry
(hungry)
A hungry mob is a angry mob
(angry mob)
A rain a fall, but the dirt it tough
(dirt it tough)
A pot a cook but the food no 'nough
(food no ‘nough)

My belly full, but me hungry
(hungry)
A hungry mob is a angry mob
(angry mob)
A rain a fall, but the dirt it tough
