Lively Up Yourself (Live! Album) LyricsLively up yourself, and don't be no drag
Lively up yourself
(Lively up yourself)
Reggae is another bag
Lively up yourself
(Lively up yourself)
And don't say no
Lively up yourself
(Lively up yourself)
‘Cause I said so
Do what you want do…
You rock so, you rock so
(You rock so, you rock so)
Like I never did before
You dip so, you dip so
(You dip so, you dip so)
'Til you dip through my door
(You skank so, you skank so)
Oh yeah!
(You come so, you come so)
Come alive today, yeah
You're gonna lively up yourself
(Lively up yourself)
And don't be no drag
Lively up yourself
(Lively up yourself)
For reggae is another bag
Lively up yourself
(Lively up yourself)
And don't say ‘no'
Lively up yourself
(Lively up yourself)
'Cause I said so
What you got that I don't know
I'm trying to wonder, wonder why you
Wonder, wonder why you act so
(Lively up yourself)
And, don't be no drag
Lively up yourself
(Lively up yourself)
For reggae is another bag
(Lively up yourself)
