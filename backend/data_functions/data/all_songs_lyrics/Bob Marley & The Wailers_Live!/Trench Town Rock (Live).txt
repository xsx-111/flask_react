One good thing about music
When it hits you feel no pain
One good thing about music
When it hits you feel no pain
So hit me with music, hit me with music
Hit me with music, hit me with music now
I got to say
(trench town rock)
I say don't watch that
(trench town rock)
Big fish or sprat
(trench town rock)
You reap what you sow
(trench town rock)
And everyone know now
(trench town rock)
Don't turn your back
(trench town rock)
Give the slum a try
(trench town rock)
Never let the children cry
(trench town rock)
Cause you got to tell Jah, Jah, why
You grooving
