In the Morning of the Magicians Lyrics
In the morning I'd awake
And I couldn't remember
What is love and what is hate
The calculation's error
Oh, oh, oh

What is love and what is hate?
And why does it matter?
Is to love just a waste?
How can it matter?
Oh, oh, oh

As the dawn began to break
I had to surrender
The universe will have its way
Too powerful to master
Oh, oh, oh

What is love and what is hate?
And why does it matter?
Is to love just a waste?
How can it matter?
Oh, oh, oh8Embed
