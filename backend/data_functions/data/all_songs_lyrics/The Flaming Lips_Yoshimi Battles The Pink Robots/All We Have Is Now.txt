All We Have Is Now LyricsAs logic stands, you couldn't meet a man who's from the future
But logic broke; as he appeared, he spoke about the future
"We're not going to make it," he explained how the end will come You and me were never meant to be part of the future
All we have is now
All we've ever had is now
All we have is now
All we'll ever have is now
I noticed that he had a watch and hat that looked familiar
He was me, from a dimension torn free of the future
(Pre-Chorus)
(Chorus)
All we have is now3Embed
