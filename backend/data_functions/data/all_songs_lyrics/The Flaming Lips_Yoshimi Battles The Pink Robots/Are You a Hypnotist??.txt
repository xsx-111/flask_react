Are You a Hypnotist?? Lyrics
I had forgiven you
For tricking me again
But I have been tricked again
Into forgiving you

What is this?
Are you some kind of hypnotist?
Waving your powers around
The sun eclipse behind the cloud

I thought I recognized your face
Amongst all of those strangers
But I am the stranger now
Amongst all of the recognized

What is this?
Are you some kind of hypnotist?
Waving your powers around
The sun eclipse behind the cloud3Embed
