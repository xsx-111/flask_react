Up Above the Daily Hum Lyrics
Wondering at the scope of my experience
Cautious so not to be cold
Caught up in the comfort of what I once was
Lost in all the brand new possibility
Oh to be

In the middle
Happy on the pull of the past
Just before the future comes
Hoping for the rush of some experience
That could elevate me

Up above the daily hum
Up above the daily hum
Up above the daily hum
Up above the daily hum

When is this all over
When does the next one begin
Happy on the pull of the past
Just before the future comes
Hoping for the rush of some experience
That could elevate me
Up above the daily hum
Up above the daily hum
Up above the daily hum
Up above the daily humEmbed
