Fight Test Lyrics
"The test begins... now!"

I thought I was smart
I thought I was right
I thought it better not to fight
I thought there was a virtue in always being cool
So when it came time to fight
I thought I'll just step aside
And that the time would prove you wrong
And that you would be the fool

I don't know where the sun beams end
And the starlights begin
It's all a mystery

Oh, to fight is to defend
If it's not now, then tell me when would be the time that you would stand up and be a man?
For to lose I could accept
But to surrender I just wept and regretted this moment
Oh, that I, I was the fool

I don't know where the sun beams end
And the starlights begin
It's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides
What's right for his own life
It's all a mystery
Because I'm a man, not a boy
And there are things you can't avoid
You have to face them when you're not prepared to face them
If I could, I would
But you're with him now, it'd do no good
I should have fought him
But instead I let him, I let him take you

I don't know where the sun beams end
And the starlights begin
It's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides
What's right for his own life
It's all a mystery

"The test is over... now!"6Embed
