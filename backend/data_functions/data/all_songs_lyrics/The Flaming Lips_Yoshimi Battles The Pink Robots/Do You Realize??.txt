Do You Realize?? Lyrics
One, two, three, four...

Do you realize
That you have the most beautiful face?
Do you realize

We're floating in space?
Do you realize
That happiness makes you cry?

Do you realize
That everyone you know someday will die?

And instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know
You realize that life goes fast
It's hard to make the good things last
You realize the sun doesn't go down
It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning 'round

Do you realize? Oh, oh, oh
Do you realize
That everyone you know someday will die?

And instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know
You realize that life goes fast
It's hard to make the good things last
You realize the sun doesn't go down
It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning 'round

Do you realize
That you have the most beautiful face?
Do you realize?17Embed
