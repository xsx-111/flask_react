Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell Lyrics
I was waiting on a moment
But the moment never came
All the billion other moments
Were just slipping all away
(I must have been tripping) Were just slipping all away
(Just ego tripping)

I was wanting you to love me
But your love, it never came
All the other love around me
Was just wasting all away
(I must have been tripping) Was just wasting all away
(Just ego tripping) Was just wasting all away
(Must have been tripâ€”)

I was waiting on a moment
But the moment never came
But the moment never came

(Must have been tripping) But the moment never came
(Just ego tripping) But the moment never came
(Just ego tripping) But the moment never came
(Just ego tripping) But the moment never came4Embed
