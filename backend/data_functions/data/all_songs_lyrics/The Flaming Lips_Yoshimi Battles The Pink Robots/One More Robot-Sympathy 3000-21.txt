One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21 Lyrics
Unit 3000-21 is warming
Makes a humming sound
When its circuits duplicate emotions
And a sense of coldness detaches
As it tries to comfort your sadness

One more robot learns to be
Something more than a machine
When it tries, the way it does
Makes it seem like it can love
'Cause it's hard to say what's real
When you know the way you feel
Is it wrong to think it's love
When it tries the way it does?

Feeling a synthetic kind of love
Dreaming a sympathetic wish
As the lights blink faster and brighter

One more robot learns to be
Something more than a machine
When it tries, the way it does
Makes it seem like it can love
Cause it's hard to say what's real
When you know the way you feel
Is it wrong to think it's love
When it tries the way it does?1Embed
