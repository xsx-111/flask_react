Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Pt. 1 Lyrics
Her name is Yoshimi
She's a black belt in karate
Working for the city
She has to discipline her body

Cause she knows that
It's demanding
To defeat those evil machines
I know she can beat them

Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots eat me
Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots defeat me

Those evil-natured robots (I'll get you, Yoshimi)
They're programmed to destroy us
She's gotta be strong to fight them
So she's taking lots of vitamins

Cause she knows that
It'd be tragic
If those evil robots win
I know she can beat them
Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots defeat me
Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots eat me

Yoshimi

Cause she knows that
It'd be tragic
If those evil robots win
I know she can beat them

Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots defeat me
Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots defeat me
Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots eat me
Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots eat me
