Coming Back to Me Baby Lyrics
Come back to me, baby, alright
I'm coming back to you now
Plus, I wanna know, yeah
Will you tell me, are you going to be true, now?
Yeah, I want you to stop lying
You've got to stop crying
Oh, I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back home, alright
To give you one more chance, now, alright
I've got to- got to be your only man
I want you to stop your lying
I want you to stop your crying
I'll be home tonight, now

I want you to stop your lying
I want you to stop all your crying
Oh, I'll be home tonight
Coming back to you, baby
I'm coming back to you, now
You don't do right
I won't be back again
I want you to stop your lying
I wanna stop your crying
Get together
Get to- get to
Gotta stop
Got to, got to, got to stop your lying
Got to stop your cryingEmbed
