Pouring Water on a Drowning Man Lyrics
You push me when I'm falling
And you kick me when I'm down
I guess I missed my calling
'Cause I should have been a clown
How much more
How much more could I stand
When you're pouring water
On a drowning man (I like that)

Put me on the right track
And then you let me down
You stab me in the back
(Yes you do baby!)
Everytime I turn around, oh
Criticizin' my love
Won't you try, just try to understand
You're pouring water
(I've got to tell you 'bout it!)
On a drowning man

You're pouring water on a drowning man
You treat me like the fool that I am
You bragged that I like everything you do
You put salt in my wound it's sad but it's true
You warm me with your kissin' then you leave me in the cold
How can I know your wishes?
Will you tell me?
When I've never been told
Alright
I'm cryin' mercy baby
Just try to understand
You're pouring water
(I've got to tell you 'bout it!)
I'm an old drowning man, yeah
You're pouring water (Hahaha)
You see I'm a drowning man
Oh, I got tears in my eyes
I'm a drowning man
Don't let me drown
Oh baby, I'm a drowning manEmbed
