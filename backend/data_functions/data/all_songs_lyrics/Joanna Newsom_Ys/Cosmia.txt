Cosmia LyricsWhen you ate
I saw your eyelashes
Saw them shake like
Wind on rushes
In the cornfield
When she called me
Moths surround me
Thought they'd drown me
And I miss your precious heart
And I miss your precious heart
Dried rose petals, redbrown circles
Framed your eyes and
Stained your knuckles
Dried rose petals, redbrown circles
Framed your eyes and
Stained your knuckles
And all those lonely nights
Down by the river
You brought me bread and water
(Water, in.);
But though I tried so hard
My little darlin
I couldn't keep the night from coming in
And all those lonely nights
Down by the river
I was brought my bread and water
By the kith and the kin;
Now in the quiet hour
When I am sleeping
I cannot keep the night from coming in
Why've you gone away?
Gone away again?
I'll sleep through the rest of my days
If you've gone away again
I'll sleep through the rest of my days
And I'll sleep through the rest of my days
And I'll sleep through the rest of my days
Why've you gone away
Seven suns, seven suns away
Away, away, away
Can you hear me? Will you listen?
Don't come near me. Don't go missing
And in the lissome light of evening:
Help me, Cosmia; I'm grieving
And all those lonely nights
Down by the river
You brought me bread and water
(Water, in.);
But though I tried so hard
My little darlin
I couldn't keep the night from coming in
And all those lonely nights
Down by the river
Brought my bread and water
In the kith and the kin;
Now in the quiet hour
When I am sleeping
I cannot keep the night from coming in
*
Beneath the porch-light
We've all been circling
Beat our dust hearts;
Singe our flour wings
But in the corner
Something is happening!
Wild Cosmia, what have you seen?
Water were your limbs
And the fire was your hair â€”
And then the moonlight caught your eye
And you rose through the air
Well, if you've seen true light
Then this is my prayer:
Will you call me, when you get there?
And I miss your precious heart;
And I miss your precious heart;
And miss, and miss, and miss
And miss, and miss, and
Miss, and miss, and miss your heart
But release your precious heart
To its feast, for precious hearts4Embed
