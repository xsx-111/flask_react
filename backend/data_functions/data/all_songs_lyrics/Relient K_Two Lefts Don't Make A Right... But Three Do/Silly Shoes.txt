Pepperoni!
(And it was all just a dream)
(baby, rap song)

I'm the confused necklace I keep getting restless
Eating 20 lbs of pasghetti for breakfast
Still showing up on your "10 Best Dressed" list
I told you my name is M.C. Defenseless
Duct tape wrapped around my feet
Held hostage before the big track meet
14 feet from 18th street
I know for a fact that you think i'm neat

Yo, you stick around like a fly on the wall
With surround sound you found that you hear it all
When it all comes through I hear you say subdued:
(I never thought money really mattered to you)
When all the kings horses and all the kings men
Took all the kings credit and they started to spend
It all on the worthlessness a tragedy went
(You're moving in with your aunty and uncle in Bel Air)

(Ladies and gentlemen, the worst freestyle rapper ever!)
Um uh... give me a second
Uh... shoot!
Um uh... alright, here we go
Apples are green
And carrots are orange
And then they go and then you go
What...nothing... what rhymes with orange?
Oh geez, I really am bad
Just gimme, gimme a second...
(naw man, you're done!)

Who's that wearing those silly shoes?
(We are wearing those silly shoes!)
Well I really hate those silly shoes
(Well we really like those silly shoes)
Please stop wearing those silly shoes
(We won't stop wearing our silly shoes)
(They're just shoes, man!)
Well I've learned to respect your silly shoes
(The respect we'll use so that we won't lose)
Can I try on a pair of your silly shoes?
(Man, quit talking about those silly shoes!)
You say I'm boring, but I say hardly
(let's get together have a pizza party!)
PIZZA PARTY!
PEPPERONI!
(And it was all just a dream)...
Forever...

(Snakessss...)Embed
