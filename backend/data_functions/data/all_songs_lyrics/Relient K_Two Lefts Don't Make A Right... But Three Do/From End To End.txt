Excuse me
But I’ve got a request
Could you take the gag off of my mouth?
I admit
That I’m fairly impressed
'Cause you're the best at blocking me out
I believe
That we weren't quite done
I know it's hard to hear me out again
I realize
You're not the only one
Who’s terrified of life from end to end

Hey-hey, can you hear anything I say?
I’m feeling unwanted, that's not what I wanted
And attention to me is something you refuse to pay

'Cause I just can’t believe the way that this continues to go on
I say I wish you didn’t always think I’m wrong
So tell me
Tell me, what will it take to get this through your head?
And tell me, what will it take
Until you see things through from end to end?
Excuse me
But isn't this the way
That things always turn into something good?
You’ve tried to
Ignore the things I say
But in the end you found you never could

Hey-hey, can you hear anything I say?
You search for the shortcut, you live life but for what?
I love you and hope you will find the truth someday

'Cause I just can’t believe the way that this continues to go on
I say I wish you didn’t always think I’m wrong
So tell me
Tell me, what will it take to get this through your head?
And tell me, what will it take
Until you see things through from end to end?

So tell me
Tell me, what will it take to get this through your head?
And tell me, what will it take
To get you on my good side again?
And tell me, what will it take
To get this through your head?
And tell me, what will it take
To forget what you knew?
Just let Him find you
And then you'll see things through from end to endEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
