I think it might just be alright
To leave what matters out of sight
Old habits die hard holding on
Inevitable means it's never gone
Told myself what I need to hear
I think the point was very clear
I showed me what we'd missed since we
Slipped into inconsistency

It seems that my ties with You get severed
I can't seem to hold the thing together
I just fall apart
'Cause that's my trademark

It's my, my trademark move
To turn my back on You
It's my, my trademark move
To realize I should improve
And sometime soon after that
You'll see me come crawlin' back

I'll kill the thing that turns me away
Amputate the arm that will disobey
Withdraw from everything that's hurting me
Until You finish Your work in me
Told myself what I need to hear
I think the point was very clear
I showed me what we'd missed since we
Slipped into inconsistency
It seems that my ties with You get severed
I can't seem to hold the thing together
I just fall apart
'Cause that's my trademark

It's my, my trademark move
To turn my back on You
It's my, my trademark move
To realize I should improve
And sometime soon after that
You'll see me come crawlin' back


It's my, my trademark move
To turn my back on You
It's my, my trademark move
To realize I should improve
It's my, my trademark move
To turn my back on You
It's my, my trademark move
To realize I should improve
And sometime soon after that
You'll see me come crawlin' backEmbed
