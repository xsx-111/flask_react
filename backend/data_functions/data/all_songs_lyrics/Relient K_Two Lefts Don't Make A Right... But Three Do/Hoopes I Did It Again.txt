Hoopes I Did It Again Lyrics
What's up dude?
(I'm getting kind of bored)
Let's get some food and then hit movies 4
(What's going on? Whats up with all our friends?)
Let's start a rumor just to find out where it ends
'Cause a small town is like a small stage
For teenagers and their drama
Instead of playing shows, we'll be showing plays
Like 90210 without the Beverly Hills

Well, don't you think, don't you think it's high time (Don't you think)
That we never settle down? (That we never settle down)
Well, don't you think, don't you think it's high time (Don't you think)
That we get out of this town? (That we get out of this town)
'Cause if we leave then we just might be okay

Hoopes, I did it again
I messed everything up, and I think I hurt my friends
Hoopes, I did it again
Relationships that work are things that I can't comprehend

Ohio has the flavor of a water chestnut
It's not too crazy and it's not the best but
We're not setting forest fires just out of boredom
I'd rather see a movie if in fact I can afford one
'Cause a small town is like a small stage
For teenagers and their drama
Instead of playing shows, we'll be showing plays
Like 90210 without the Beverly Hills
Well, don't you think, don't you think it's high time (Don't you think)
That we never settle down? (That we never settle down)
Well, don't you think, don't you think it's high time (Don't you think)
That we get out of this town? (That we get out of this town)
'Cause if we leave then we just might make a difference
And if we leave then we might just be okay
And I don't think it would hurt to get away

Hoopes, I did it again
I messed everything up, and I think I hurt my friends
Hoopes, I did it again
Relationships that work are things that I can't comprehend

Dan Bakitus said I'm shallow
He said I've got no integrity
But, I don't know Dan Bakitus
And Dan Bakitus, he don't know me

'Cause we always say in Canton
You can't enjoy yourself
Well, there's truth to that
But may I add
It's not half bad and never less than that
'Cause we always say in Canton
You can't enjoy yourself
Well, there's truth to that
But may I add
It's not half bad and never less than thatEmbed
