Falling Out Lyrics
I'm falling out
Of grace with the world
They say I've lost my Midas touch
What turned to gold now turns to rust
I'm falling out
Of line with all the stars
That flood my dreams with their guitars and magazines

Face down
This carpet tastes like coffee grounds, ground into my
Face now
And every angle's covered with just another

I'm falling out
Of style with the current way things are
The things that make conforming hard
I'm falling out
Of control and you just can't stop me now
I'll fight as long as time allows

Face down
This carpet tastes like coffee grounds, ground into my
Face now
And every angle's covered with just another (Band-Aid)
I'm out here
Way beyond
A shadow
Of a doubt
And I know I'm never falling out (Falling out)
Of favor with You
I'm out here
Way beyond
A shadow
Of a doubt
And I know
I'm never falling out (Falling out, falling out)
Of favor with You

I won't think twice or even three times
About taking a gamble with You
'Cause with my life You have been so kind
I take all my comfort from You

Face down
This carpet tastes like coffee grounds, ground into my
Face now
And every angle's covered with just another (Band-Aid)
I'm out here
Way beyond
A shadow
Of a doubt
And I know
I'm never falling out (Falling out)
Of favor with You
I'm out here
Way beyond
A shadow
Of a doubt
And I know
I'm never falling out (Falling out, falling out)
Of favor with YouEmbed
