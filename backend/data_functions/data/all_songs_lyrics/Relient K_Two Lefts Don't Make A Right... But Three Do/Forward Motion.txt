Forward Motion Lyrics
(Whoa-oh) I've been banging my head against the wall
(Whoa-oh) For so long it seems I knocked it down
Yeah, it got knocked down
(Whoa-oh) And the heating bill went through the roof
(Whoa-oh) And the wall I knocked down was the proof
That my landlord needed to kick me out

I got evicted, now I'm living on the street
My spirit's lifted, oh wait, that wasn't me
Too many turns have turned out to be wrong
This time I learned that I knew it all along
When car crashes occur then I'll be what you were (Whoa-oh)
When I see what I should, when I see that it's good
That it's good

To experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat then brush my teeth
Experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat then brush my teeth

'Cause I struggle with forward motion
I struggle with forward motion
We all struggle with forward motion
'Cause forward motion is harder than it sounds
Well every time I gain some ground I gotta turn myself around again
It's harder then it sounds
Well, every time I gain some ground I gotta turn myself around again
(Whoa-oh) I've been banging my head against the wall
(Whoa-oh) For so long it seems I've got knocked out
Yeah, got knocked out cold
(Whoa-oh) And the medical bills went through the roof
(Whoa-oh) And the scar on my head is the proof
That I'll still remember this when I get old

I got evicted, now I'm living on the street
My spirit's lifted, oh wait, that wasn't me
Too many turns have turned out to be wrong
This time I learned that I knew it all along
Well, I grasp the concept that I'll sleep where you slept (Whoa-oh)
Well, I know I need help when I allow myself
Allow myself

To experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat then brush your teeth
Experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat then brush your teeth

'Cause I struggle with forward motion
I struggle with forward motion
We all struggle with forward motion
'Cause forward motion is harder than it sounds
Well, every time I gain some ground I gotta turn myself around again
It's harder then it sounds
Well, every time I gain some ground I gotta turn myself around again
'Cause I struggle with forward motion
'Cause I struggle with forward motion
We all struggle with forward motion
('Cause forward motion is harder than it sounds)
'Cause I struggle with forward motion
(Well, every time I gain some ground, I gotta turn myself around again)
'Cause I struggle with forward motion
(It's harder then it sounds)
We all struggle with forward motion
(Well, every time you gain some ground, you gotta turn myself around again)
'Cause I struggle with forward motion
'Cause I struggle with forward motion
We all struggle with forward motionEmbed
