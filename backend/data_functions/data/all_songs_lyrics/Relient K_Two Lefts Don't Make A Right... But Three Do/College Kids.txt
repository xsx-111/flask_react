College Kids Lyrics
Someone, please save us, us college kids
What my parents told me is what I did
They said, "Go to school and be a college kid"
But, in the end, I questioned why I did

I'm poor, I'm starving, I'm flat broke, I've got no cash to spend
Sell all my books for front row tickets to Dave Matthews Band
My girlfriend's at another school, I know this year will test her
I called, found out she had three other boyfriends last semester
And that's why I say:

(Oh no!) Not for me, not for me
Call it torture, call it university
(No!) Arts and crafts is all I need
I'll take calligraphy and then I'll make a fake degree

Eighty grand later, I found out that all that I had learned
Is that you should show up to take your finals and your mid-terms
The party scene is kind of mean; I think it's sick and twisted
The Navy showed up at my door and claimed that I enlisted
And that's why I say:
(Oh no!) Not for me, not for me
Call it torture, call it university
(No!) Arts and crafts is all I need
I'll take calligraphy and then I'll make a fake degree

Don't get excited, she'll say "no" without a doubt, you see
And I've decided college girls just won't go out with me
They make me nervous and they always catch me off my guard
Like cell phone service, I drop out 'cause college is too hard
It's time to call my father
'Cause it's his Alma Mater
Good grades aren't what they seem
I think he knows the dean
It's time to call my father
'Cause it's his Alma Mater
He says he's proud of me
But college always was his dream
And I would always say, "It's not for me"

(Oh no!) Not for me, not for me
Call it torture, call it university
(No!) Arts and crafts is all I need
I'll take calligraphy and then I'll make a fake degree
Someone, please save us, us college kids
What my parents told me is what I did
They said, "Go to school and be a college kid"
But, in the end, I questioned why I did
Do what will make you happy, do what you feel is right
(Someone, please save us, us college kids)
Only but one thing matters: learn how to live your life
(What my parents told me is what I did)
Do what will make God happy, do what you feel is right
(They said, "Go to school and be a college kid")
Only but one thing matters: learn how to live your life
(But in the end: learn how to live your life)6Embed
