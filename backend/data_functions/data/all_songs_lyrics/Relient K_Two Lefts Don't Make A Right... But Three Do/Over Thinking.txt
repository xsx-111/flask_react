I was thinking, overthinking
'Cause there’s just too many scenarios
To analyze
Look in my eyes
'Cause you're my dream, please come true
I was thinking, overthinking
About exactly how I’m not exactly him
I'll break my heart in two more times than you could ever do
'Cause you're my dream, please come true

'Cause I think way too much
On a one track mind
And you're so out of touch
'Cause I'm so far behind
I can't deny this anymore
The facts ignored all done before
And if there’s one in this world
You'll let me know you're not that girl

I was sinking, lower sinking
'Cause I lost the things I've held on to
They let me think a thought, a thought that I would know was not
Of seeing my dream come true
I was thinking, overthinking
About how far I had let this go
One more guy/girl cliché
I know now you're just in the way
Of me and my dream come true
'Cause I think way too much
On a one track mind
And you're so out of touch
'Cause I'm so far behind
I'm trying to make sense
Out of all of this
While your fading scent
Just slips through my grip
I can't deny this anymore
The facts ignored all done before
And if there’s one in this world
You'll let me know you're not that girl

Don't touch the positive with the negative end
Don't touch the positive with the negative end
'Cause after all of the sparks you're still alone in the dark
'Cause after all of the sparks you're left alone in the dark
And while I'm able, I think I’ll label
Experience with you as a mistake
And while I'm at it, I'll say I've had it
Experience with you is a mistake

'Cause I think way too much
On a one track mind
And you're so out of touch
'Cause I'm so far behind
I'm trying to make sense
Out of all of this
While your fading scent
Just slips through my grip
I was thinking, overthinking
'Cause there’s just too many scenarios
To think about
To figure out
If you're my dream, please come trueEmbed
