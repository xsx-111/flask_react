Getting Into You Lyrics
When I made up my mind
And my heart along with that
To live not for myself
But yet for God, somebody said
"Do you know what you are getting yourself into?"

When I finally ironed out
All of my priorities
And asked God to remove the doubt
That makes me so unsure of these
Things I ask myself, I ask myself
"Do you know what you are getting yourself into?"

I'm getting into You
Because You got to me in a way words can't describe
I'm getting into You
Because I've got to be
You're essential to survive
I'm gonna love You with my life

When He looked at me and said
"I kind of view you as a son"
And for one second our eyes met
And I met that with a question
"Do You know what You are getting yourself into?
I'm getting into You
Because You got to me in a way words can't describe
I'm getting into You
Because I've got to be
You're essential to survive
I'm gonna love You with my life

I've been a liar and I'll never amount to
The kind of person You deserve to worship You
You say You will not dwell on what I did but rather what I do
You say, "I love you and that's what you are getting yourself into"

I'm getting into You (Getting into You)
Because You got to me in a way words can't describe (Because You got to me)
I'm getting into You (I'm getting into You)
Because I've got to be (Because I've got to be)
You're essential to survive
I'm gonna love You with my life
I'm getting into You (Getting into You)
Because You got to me, in a way words can't describe (Because You got to me)
I'm getting into You (I'm getting into You, I'm getting into You)
Because I've got to be (Because I've got to be)
You're essential to survive
I'm gonna love You with my life
He said, "I love you and that's what you are getting yourself into"2Embed
