Sometimes its embarrassing to talk to You
To hold a conversation with
The only One who sees right through this
Version of myself I try to hide behind
I'll bury my face because my disgrace will leave me terrified

And sometimes I'm so thankful for Your loyalty
Your love regardless of
The mistakes I make will spoil me
My confidence is in a sense, a gift You've given me
And I'm satisfied to realize You're all I'll ever need

You looked into my life and never stopped
And You're thinking all my thoughts are so simple, but so beautiful
And You recite my words right back to me, before I even speak
You let me know, I am understood

And sometimes I spend my time just trying to escape
I work so hard, so desperately in an attempt to create space
'Cause I want distance from the utmost important thing I know
I see Your love, then turn my back and beg for You to go
You looked into my life and never stopped
And You're thinking all my thoughts are so simple, but so beautiful
And You recite my words right back to me, before I even speak
You let me know, I am understood

You're the only One who understands completely
You're the only One who knows me yet still loves completely

And sometimes the place I'm at is at a loss for words
If I think of something worthy
I know that it's already Your's
And through the times I've faded and You've outlined me again
You've just patiently waited to bring me back and then

You looked into my life and never stopped
And You're thinking all my thoughts are so simple, but so beautiful
And You recite my words right back to me, before I even speak
You let me know, I am understood

Your noise has broken my defense
Let me embrace salvation
Your voice has broken my defense
Let me embrace salvation
Your noise has broken my defense
Let me embrace salvation
Your voice has broken my defense
Let me embrace salvation
Your noise has broken my defense
Let me embrace salvation
Your voice has broken my defense
Let me embrace salvation
Your noise has broken my defense
Let me embrace salvation
Let me embrace
