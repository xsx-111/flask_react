Jefferson Aero Plane Lyrics
If it hurts, kiss it better
You wear skirts, I write nice letters
Never said nothing with flowers
Though we always talked for hours
And it seems to get much colder
When you cry on your own shoulder
And we know the show must go on
Guess I know, I guess I'll throw on

Some Jefferson Airplane, I'm trapped and I am enclosed
But I won't complain, I'll open all the windows
Jefferson Airplane, I'm trapped and I am enclosed
But I won't complain, I'll open all the windows
'Cause when it's colder I feel much better
When I cry on my own shoulder
Just throw on a sweater and go

And I'll go to undergo
A change of heart, a change of clothes
And when I'm home
I think I'll go eat cereal and stare out the window

I'll make the calls, you cover your ears
Niagara Falls still flows on New Year's
I will save your plunging neckline
Kiss your face, you try to deck mine
If I behave it's gonna cost him
Skip the rave in downtown Boston
We all know the show must go on
Guess I know, I guess I'll throw on
Some Jefferson Airplane, I'm trapped and I am enclosed
But I won't complain, I'll open all the windows
Jefferson Airplane, I'm trapped and I am enclosed
But I won't complain, I'll open all the windows
'Cause when it's colder I feel much better
When I cry on my own shoulder
Just throw on a sweater and go

And I'll go to undergo
A surgery to purge me of this lonely mood
And my ego
The status quo provides me with a decent attitude
And I'll go to undergo
A change of heart, a change of clothes
And when I'm home
I think I'll go eat cereal and stare out the window

'Cause you confuse me more than anyone
An adjustment has begun
To let me feel the desperate need to leave what we undid undone
And maybe you could sympathize
With the bags under my eyes
And we'll see the signs are saying that we have used up all our tries
To be a better person
To be a better friend
To be a better son
He tries to be a better someone
That understands the difference
And that he can't show all the people
All the things that really mean as much as he could
Feels like I don't remember
Ever being this tired
Before now my eyes were closed to
All of the beauty in this world
Jefferson Airplane, I'm trapped and I am enclosed
But I won't complain, I'll open all the windows
Jefferson Airplane, I'm trapped and I am enclosed
But I won't complain, I'll open all the windows
'Cause when it's colder
I feel much better
When I cry on my own shoulder
Just throw on a sweater and go

And I'll go to undergo
A surgery to purge me of this lonely mood
And my ego
The status quo, provides me with a decent attitude
And I'll go to undergo
A change of heart, a change of clothes
And I'll go, oh yes, I'll go
And hope the new me shows
So everybody

Knows that I've found myself
Able to fly away without
Magic feathers or Jefferson Aero planes
I've got with me all that I needEmbed
