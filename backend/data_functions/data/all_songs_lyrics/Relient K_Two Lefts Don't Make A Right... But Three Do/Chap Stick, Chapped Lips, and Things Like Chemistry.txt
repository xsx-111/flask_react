Okay, so, who doesn't own a cell phone?
Who brought back their permission slip?
Because I know nobody wants to stay home
While the rest of us go out and make a day of it

'Cause theme parks are so much more fun when the sun's outside (Na-na-na-na-na)
And I lost my phone to the lake beneath the Batman ride (Na-na-na-na)

They're starting something, and I don't want to begin it (I don't wanna begin it)
They're looking for trouble, but with me it won't be found (With me it won't be found)
And I regret that I'm completely out of daytime minutes (I don't wanna begin it)
And so I guess I'll have to wait a lot 'til 8 o'clock comes around

Okay, so, who doesn't own a cell phone?
Well, I don't need to ask my friends
Because I know mine was fastened to my jawbone
Thanks to all those nights and weekends

'Cause theme parks are so much more fun when the sun's outside (Na-na-na-na-na)
And I lost my phone to the lake beneath the Batman ride (Na-na-na-na, yeah!)
They're starting something, and I don't want to begin it (I don't wanna begin it)

And I regret that I'm completely out of daytime minutes (I don't wanna begin it)
And so I guess I'll have to wait a lot 'til 8 o'clock comes around

When it comes to relationships (I'm the dumbest one)
And I don't mean just with girls (I mean with everyone)
Your illustrations always point out just what's wrong with me
It's chapstick, and chapped lips, and things like chemistry
It's chapstick, and chapped lips, and things like
It's chapstick, and chapped lips, and things like
It's chapstick, and chapped lips, and things like chemistry


Can I relate to you the way you relate to me?
Can you help me out with my chemistry?
I don't wanna be perceived the way I am
I just want to be perceived the way I amEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
