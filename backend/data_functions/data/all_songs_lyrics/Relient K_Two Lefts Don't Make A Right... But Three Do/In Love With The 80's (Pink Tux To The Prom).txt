In Love With The 80's (Pink Tux To The Prom) Lyrics
So it was Jeremy in 1983
In his Ocean Pacific tee
Who got a bloody knee
On his skateboard
In the half pipe
In the backyard that Tuesday night

And I'm only gonna pierce my left ear
And I've been working on this mustache all summer long
And my favorite band will always be Tears For Fears
And I'm gonna wear a pink tux to the prom

Cutting class through the first floor window
He's driving fast 'cause he never did a thing slow
And I look up to my big bro
'Cause in the 80's all the ladies grabbed his hand and couldn't let go

And I'm only gonna pierce my left ear
And I've been working on this mustache all summer long
And my favorite band will always be Tears For Fears
And I'm gonna wear a pink tux to the prom
A pink tux to the prom
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Pink tux to the prom
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Pink tux to the prom

(I am gonna wear) A pink tux to the prom
(Live without a care) What could possibly go wrong?

When you're the president of the Breakfast Club
And you're not hesitant to fall in love, to fall in love
To throw it away, to fall in love with the '80s

(I am gonna wear) A pink tux to the prom
(Live without a care) What could possibly go wrong?
(I am gonna wear) A pink tux to the prom
(Live without a care) 'Cause you threw it away to fall in love with the '80s

Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-dooEmbed
