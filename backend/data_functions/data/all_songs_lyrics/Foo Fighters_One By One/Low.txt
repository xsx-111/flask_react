Low Lyrics
Hey you
Are you in there
I'm stuck outside you, ooh
We could use
One another
Another like you, ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your new one to pass through
Screws inside
Turn so tight
Turning on you
I'm hanging on you, ooh

Baby blue (baby blue)
Don't go nowhere (don't go nowhere)
I'm right beside you, ooh
Me and you (me and you)
Going nowhere (going nowhere)
I'm right beside you, ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your new one to pass through
Screws inside
Turn so tight
Turning on you
I'm hanging on you
Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go

Ooh, ooh, ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your new one to pass through
Screws inside
Turn so tight
Turning on you
I'm hanging on you

Taking you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (low as you go)
Taking you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (as low as you go)

(Low as you go)
(As low as you go)
(Low as you go)
(As low as you go)
(Low as you go)
Ooh, ooh

Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (low as you go)
Taking you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (as low as you go)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh1Embed
