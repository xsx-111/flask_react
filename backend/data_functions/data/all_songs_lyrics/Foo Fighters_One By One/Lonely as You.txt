Lonely as You Lyrics
What would I do
Lonely as you
Pleasure or pain
I can't choose
What would I do
Lonely as you
Pleasure or pain
I can't choose

Wake up, you're dreaming
I can't stand your screaming
Drowning out these prayers
Just some words without meaning
Spare all the preaching
My secrets worth keeping
No one understands like I do

Keep out of reach
I'm your leading deletion
Hide behind these masks
Though they still see right through them
Every now and then
You're down and out, my friend
Down and out again
Down and out again
Down and out again but I'm down with you

One more time for the last time (ah oh)
One more time for release (ah oh)
One more time for the last time (ah oh)
Everyone wants to believe (ah oh)

Blame it on youth, all these years I've been losing
Blame it on the past, it's the last place I knew you
Blame all the children, they're raging and ruined
Blame it on the black and the blue

Every now and then
You're down and out, my friend
Down and out again
Down and out again
Down and out again but I'm down with you
One more time for the last time (ah oh)
One more time for release (ah oh)
One more time for the last time (ah oh)
Everyone wants to believe (ah oh)

Every now and then
You're down and out, my friend
Down and out again
Down and out again
Down and out again but I'm down with you

One more time for the last time (ah oh)
One more time for release (ah oh)
One more time for the last time (ah oh)
Everyone wants to believe (ah oh)

One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the last time
Everyone wants to believe
One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the very last time
Everyone wants to believe, alright1Embed
