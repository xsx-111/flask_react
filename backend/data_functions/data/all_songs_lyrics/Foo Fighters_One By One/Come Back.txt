Come Back LyricsOhh, Ohh

Moving, again
Comfort of the chase
Now and again
This my saving grace
Dead on the inside I've got nothing to prove
Keep me alive and give me something to lose
Goodbye, this time
Leaving you

I've been gone so long, so, gone so long

But I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
For you
Ohh, Ohh

Changes, changing
Back and forth again
Trading faces
Strangers in the end
Dead on the inside I've got nothing to prove
Keep me alive and give me something to lose
Goodbye, this time
Leaving you

I've been gone so long, so, gone so long

But I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
For you
For you

I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
For you

I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back
I will come back1Embed
