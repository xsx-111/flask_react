Overdrive Lyrics
Coming down I'm coming round
This time I think I'm waking up
Give me loud to drown it out
Before the world starts breaking up

You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Yours and mine and left and right
There's still two sides to everyone
You and I get on with life
And pray we'll find a better one

You change and then you change again
It's turning like a wheel inside your head

Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Two strangers on the mend
Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Hurry now we're getting out
This time there's nothing stopping us
Leave behind this vacant town
Tonight and let it turn to rust

You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Two strangers, no relation, on the mend

You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Coming down I'm coming round
This time I think I'm waking up
Give me loud to drown it out
Before the world starts breaking up
You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Two strangers on the mend

Overdrive we're going life or death (overdrive we're going life or death)
Overdrive we're going life or death (overdrive we're going life or death)
Overdrive we're going life or death
Two strangers, no relation
Two strangers, no relation, on the mendEmbed
