It Gets Better LyricsWhat have we done, oh my god
What have we done, oh my god
This is really happening
You never looked so bored
Can you feel my fingernails?
They've never been so short
It's hard to lay a golden egg with everyone around
It's hard to stay inside my head when words keep pouring out

Like starlight crashing through the room, we'll lose our feathers
Yes, I know it hurts at first but it gets better
It gets better, it gets
Better
It gets better, we'll get better
It gets better, it gets better
It gets better, we'll get better
I can taste your summer sweat
It's never been so warm
So can we kick the covers off?
They're always on
It's never been so warm
It's hard to keep a straight face when I just want to smile
If you could see the look that's in your eyes

There's a fire in sky
Some snow on the ground
Not quite enough cigarettes
To calm me down
What have we done, oh my god
What have we done, oh my god

It gets better, it gets better
It gets better, we'll get better(This is really happening)2Embed
