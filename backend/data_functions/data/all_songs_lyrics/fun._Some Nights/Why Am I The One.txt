Why Am I The One Lyrics
I got enough on my mind
That when she pulls me by the hair
She hasn't much to hold onto
She keeping count on her hand one, two, three days
That I been sleeping on my side

I finished kissing my death
So now I head back up the steps
Thinking about where I've been -
I mean the sun was never like this
I wanna feel with the season
I guess it makes sense
Cause my life's become as vapid as
A night out in Los Angeles
And I just want to stay in bed

And hold you like I used to
You know that I am home
So darling if you love me
Would you let me know?

Or go on, go on, go on
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
She got enough on her mind
That she feel no sorrow
I let my fate fill the air
So now she rollin down the window
Never been one to hold on
But I need a last breath
So I ask if she remembers when
She used to come and visit me
We were fools to think that nothing could go wrong

Go on, go on, go on
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I think I kinda like it
But I might have had too much

I'll move back down to this western town
When they find me out make no mistake about it
I'll move back down to this western town
When they find me out make no mistake about it
I'll move back down to this western town
Or go on, go on, go on
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
Go on, go on, go on
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?

I think I kinda like it but I might have had too much
I'll move back down
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear a song
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear a song
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear a song17Embed
