Making Breakfast Lyrics
Watching the garden grow, happy, happy days
Got egg yolk on my bed, Chinese food on the way
Watching the garden grow, straight into the sky
Got a candle by my window, it keeps me warm at night

Spending time together
Watch out, don't let it get you down
Nothing is forever
That's right, but don't let it get you down

And I'm sitting in the back of a limousine
Just going to a show
Wishing you were here right next to me
Oh, but you already know

That I'm the one who loves you
Watch out, don't let it get you down
And there will be no other
That's right, but don't let it get you down
Oh yeah, making breakfast

Watching the garden grow, such a beautiful day
It's raining through the window but I like it that way
Watching the garden grow, the color of your eyes
Is changing with the season and God only knows why
Spending time together
Watch out, don't let it get you down
Nothing is forever
That's right, but don't let it get you down
Oh yeah, making breakfast2Embed
