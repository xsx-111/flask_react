Flavor Lyrics
I was born not breathing
Since I've woke up every day
Oh and I can't even believe it
The victims of the USA
They all keep talkin' but got nothin' to say
It had me seizing up
And so the season is up

Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart

I searched and drifted and grieved, man
Just trying to decide who to be
Oh and I took a seat by the sea
And I laid beneath the evergreen trees
And I decided I'd just try to be me
And I stopped seizing up
And still the season is up

Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart

Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heartEmbed
