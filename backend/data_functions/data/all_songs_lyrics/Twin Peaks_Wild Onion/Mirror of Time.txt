Mirror of Time Lyrics
When I look in the mirror of time
Often find that I'm doing it over
But when I look at the tears from her eyes
Don't regret a single word that I've told her
And when we're distant
I'm sure you'll think things over
I hope you'll miss it
But I'll still have an open shoulder
For you to lean and laugh and cry on, little girl

How I wish that the start of the end would begin
That she'd need all that I've shown her
I know the cycle of life could begin
And in time I'd be stuck starting over
And with the distance
I hope faith don't roll over
If you don't miss it
I'll still have an open shoulder
For you to lean and laugh and cry on, little girl

Why does love have to end?
Why do hearts have to break and mend?
Why do they tell me you won't be the only one?
They don't believe that love can last forever
Do you believe that love can last forever?
I believe that love can last forever
Do you believe that love can last forever?
I believe that love can last foreverEmbed
