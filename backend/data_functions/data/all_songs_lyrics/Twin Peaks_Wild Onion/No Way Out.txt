No Way Out Lyrics
Oh, seems there's no way out
Of a mind so fixed on it's doubts
Oh, when the walls are all torn down
Mind is free without reason to frown

Lost my company, all alone again
Felt so lonely, looked forward to the end

Oh, wore a five ton mask while it dragged me closer to death
Seen it all insane, till I put on a fresh set of frames

I knew practically nothing
And I was a wasted man too scared to really feel
But with a grasp onto something
It's just a bliss to finally glimpse something so real
Oh, I know... I 
I was running from nothing but a good view


Oh, seems there's no way out
Of a mind so fixed on it's doubts
Oh, when I'm almost there
I don't know if I feel like I care
I knew practically nothing
I was a wasted man, too scared to really feel
But with a grasp onto something
It's such a bliss to finally glimpse something so real
Oh, I know... I 
I was running from nothing but a good view

I'll do what you want to do for you
Hey girl
I'll do what you want to do for you
Girl
I'll do what you want to do for you
Hey girl
I'll do what you want to do
Hey girl
I'll do what you want to do for youEmbed
