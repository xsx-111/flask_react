Ordinary People Lyrics
I wonder why
I'd remember pain on a whim
But now I can’t seem to shake this smile
Wear a gilded grin all the while
For I know I’ll need her all of the time

I wonder how
Grandmother’s touch wasn’t enough to stick around
But the trouble I found fades steady now from brown unbound
For I know I’ll need her all of the time


*Talking*

Well, I...
I'd never let her go, she’s not like them
And never has she been just one of those people
