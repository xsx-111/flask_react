Fade Away Lyrics
You can do it
Just walk in a straight line
And rise above it
Get drunk in the daytime
I'm ridin' round my side of town, my hair in the breeze
Life for me is drinkin beer and smokin up' weed

"What's your problem?"
They're all in my head, man
"Where's your money?"
I swear that's all that I had, man
Ducking from the boys and getting mugged by yourself
Waking up and wishing you were somebody else

Imagine dreaming about dying every day
Then I get drunk and all my problems seem okay

I often wonder what my friend David would say
We weren't that close, but what's it like to fade away?Embed
