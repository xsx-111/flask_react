Sloop Jay D Lyrics
You got me feelin' so lucky and I hope that you fuck me
I hope that you love me cause I probably do
Ain't that my fuckin' problem, man
These girls won't make you happy
She said tell me something, a couple of stories
All the girls that broke me they were nothing like you
I guess I learned my lesson, got taught once
Don't be a fucking pussy, that's what she told me

Bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop bop
Bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop bop

I'm such a loser and my friends knew I'd lose her
I wake up with bruises cause now I'm a boozer
I had a lot of problems way before I knew her
And I'm feeling so scummy, I hope that you call me
I'll tell everybody that I'm no longer lonely
You don't have to be crazy, you did that once
Don't be a fucking phony, that's what she told me
Bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop bop
Bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop bop, oh, oh

And I know that it's wrong to love you for this long
Yes, that's on me
And I know that it's wrong to love you for this long
Guess that's on me

I know I'm wrong for loving you too long
I wrote you all these songs I'll never sing
Well I know I'm wrong for loving you too long
For coming on too strong, girl, that's not me1Embed
