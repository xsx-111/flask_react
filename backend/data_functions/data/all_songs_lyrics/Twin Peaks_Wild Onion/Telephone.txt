Telephone Lyrics
I heard the ringin' on the telephone
Set aside a dream and we were on our own
I could barely understand
A word came through from the other end
And now I lay here all alone

I heard the ringin' on the telephone
I heard you ringin' on the telephone
I can’t seem to understand
A word you’ve said since you’ve been gone
But I keep hanging on

I went out to the wasteland, I had no means or end
I got brains, but the quake, man, need love to lend a hand
I went out to the wastes, man
Looking for a friend
And when you leave for your own plans
I hope that this don’t endEmbed
