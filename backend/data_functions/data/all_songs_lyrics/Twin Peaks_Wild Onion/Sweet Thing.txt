Sweet Thing Lyrics
Baby, I've been thinkin' all about you lately
With the way you're looking who could really blame me?
Oh baby, oh darlin'
Of all the other girls I could be callin'
That phone of yours is ringin' off the wall and
Oh darlin', oh darlin'
You're such a sweet, sweet thing
You're sweeter and you're colder than a frozen tangerine
Thinkin' when I'm older I'ma buy you a ring
You're such a sweet, sweet thing, you've got me shook
There's women every single way I look
But you're the only one that's got me hooked
You got me hooked, oh darling


Oh baby, I've been thinkin' all about you lately
With the way you're lookin,' who could really blame me?
Oh baby, oh darlin'
Of all the other girls I could be callin'
That phone of yours is ringin' off the wall and
Oh darlin', oh darlin', oh darlin'
You're such a sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing
Oh yeah4Embed
