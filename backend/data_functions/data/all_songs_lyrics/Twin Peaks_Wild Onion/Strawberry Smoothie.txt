Strawberry Smoothie LyricsWell whatchya doing baby, in the snow?
You know you're groovy but you move too slow
And when you're crazy, girl, how it shows
You're just a smoothie with a heart made of cold
Well whatchya doing baby, in the snow?
You're just a groovy baby, in the snow
Strawberry smoothie baby, in the snow
In the blizzard, honey, you're a hound
You're headed nowhere with eyes glued to the ground
So pick your head up, honey, look around
Go pick your pieces up from the lost and found
Well whatchya doing baby, in the snow?
You're just a groovy baby, in the snow
Strawberry smoothie baby, in the snowEmbed
