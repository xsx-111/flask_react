I Found A New Way Lyrics
I found a new way
To open up my mind
I'd love to tell you ‘bout it honey
If you could find the time
And I can see the future
I can see the weather change
I can see from here to L.A
And I know that everywhere’s the same
Oh yeah
I found a way
I found a way

I found a new way
To open up the day
All you gotta do is follow me through
And I know that you'll be okay
And I found a new way
To open up my mind
All you gotta do is follow me through
And I know that you'll be fine
I found a way
I found a way
I found a new way
I found a new way
A new way to see
Just come over here and give me your ear
Let me tell you how good it could be
I can see the future
I can see the weather change
I can see from here to New York City
And I know that every place is the same, oh yeah
I found a way
I found a way
I'm scared to death
Scared to death
Scared to death
Let me say
I found a way
I found a way
I see the dark sky coming
And I know it's on its wayEmbed
