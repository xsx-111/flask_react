Hold On Lyrics
Walkin' by myself
On my way home
Put me on the shelf
Leave me at home

I said I don't care much what we talk about
When you hold me real tight I don't have a doubt
I talk a lot of noise because I think too much
Don't look down it's old enough to grow
So please hold on

Talkin' to myself
Lookin' for a home
Left out on the shelf
Won't you come home

I said I don't care much what we talk about
When you hold me real tight I don't have a doubt
I talk a lot of noise because I think too much
Don't look down it's old enough to grow
So please hold onEmbed
