Mind Frame Lyrics
Day turns to night, when all is said and done
I guess I wanted to be the lonely one
When I wake up, I've got your thoughts on my mind
Don't dim the lights 'til I'm faded, intuition's blind

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Some call it strange, it's just a frame of mind
I never said that was ideal, don't mean it ain't sublime
Beneath the moon, I am a rising sun
And as the stars come out, we'll have some fun

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

And when it's dark
Though I don't know why
Can't seem to think alright
Just wish that you'd come by-y-y-y-y
By-y-y-y
Ooh oohEmbed
