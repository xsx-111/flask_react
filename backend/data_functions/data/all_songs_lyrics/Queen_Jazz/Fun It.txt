Fun It Lyrics
Everybody in the morning
Should do a good turn all right
Everybody in the night time
Should have a good time all night
Now we got a movement
Don't shun it, fun it

Can't you see? Now you're moving free
Get some fun, join our dynasty
Can't you tell? When we get it down
You're the one, you're the best in town

Hey, everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
Just shaking the soles of your feet
Everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
That's the only soul you'll ever meet

They say that moving
The body's jive it's all right
That's the only one part
Of being alive, all right, all right
Groove on out, groove on up, okay
Do your thing, do your thing your way
Get your kicks, get your tricks with me
Get up and dance, honey, fun's for free

Everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
Just shaking the soles of your feet
Everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
Time tonight, time tonight
That's the only soul you'll ever meet

Don't shun it, fun it
Don't shun it, fun it
Don't shun it, fun it23Embed
