Dead on Time Lyrics
Oh, yeah

Fool always jumpin'
Never happy where you land, yeah
Fool got no business
Take your livin' where you can, hey
Hurry down the highway
Hurry down the road
Hurry past the people staring
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry

(Leave on time, leave on time)
Never got your ticket
But you leave on time
(Leave on time, leave on time)
Gonna get your ticket
But you leave on time
(Leave on time, leave on time)
Put it in your pocket
But you never can tell

Leave on time, leave on time
Shake that rattle
Gotta leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Fight your battle
But you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
You never got a minute
No, you never got a minute
No you never, never got
Oh, no matter
Fool got no business
Hangin' round and tellin' lies
Fool, you got no reason
But you got no compromise, hey
Stampin' on the ceilin'
Hammerin' on the walls
Got to get out, got to get out
Got to get, oh
You know I'm going crazy

(Leave on time, leave on time)
Got to get ahead
But you leave on time
(Leave on time, leave on time)
Gotta head on ahead
Gotta leave on time
(Leave on time, leave on time)
You're running in the red
But you never can tell


Hey-hey
Oh, oh
Oh, hey-hey, yeah!
Ooh, honey, honey
Gotta get laid
Where's my money
Where's my money?
I wanna get paid, I wanna get paid
Gotta leave, gotta leave
Gotta leave ya, oh!
Leave on time, leave on time
Gotta get rich
Gonna leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
But you can't take it with you
When you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Gotta keep yourself alive
But you leave on time
But you leave on time
Leave on time, dead on time

*Thunder Clap*
You're dead!3Embed
