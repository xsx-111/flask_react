More of That Jazz Lyrics
If you’re feeling tired and lonely
Uninspired and lonely
If you’re thinking how
The days seem long
All you’re given
Is what you’ve been given
A thousand times before

It's just more, more
More of that jazz
More, no more
Of that jazz
Gimme no more, no more
Of that jazz

Only football gives us thrills
Rock'n'roll just pays the bills
Only our team is the real team
Bring out the dogs
Get on your feet, lay on the floor
Can’t help thinking
I’ve heard that line before
It's just more, more, more
Of that jazz
More, no more
Of that jazz
Gimme no more, no more
Of that jazz

Oh, no matter
Fool got no business
Hanging 'round and tellin' lies
Bicycle races are coming your way
If you can’t beat ‘em join them
Fun it
Oh, you’re gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls you make
The rocking world go round

No more, no more, no more (oh)
Of that jazzEmbed
