In Only Seven Days Lyrics
Monday
Start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away
Ooh, ooh

Tuesday
Saw her down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me

Wednesday, I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday
My luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name

I never thought that this
Could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade
I wish Friday
Would last forever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there

Saturday
Just twenty-four hours
Oh no, I'm going back
Home on Sunday

I'm so sad alone2Embed
