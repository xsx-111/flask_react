Cherry Bomb Lyrics
The suspense is wild
The more I think of you
The more I melt like ice cream
Baby, because the heat of you
Has got me craving
And there's nothing I can do (do)

And the feeling won't stop
Cause I'm fire red hot
Like I'm ready to pop
It's a kinda excitement 
I cannot explain 
Oh here I go again
I can feel it coming

And it's like a flash of night
Inside there's something going on
Exploding inside me like a cherry bomb
And the thought of you
Fills me with a sweet surprise
Come to me tonight (babe, babe)
I'm feeling dynamite (babe, babe)
My heart is a delicious cherry bomb
Oh, these thoughts are killer
They sit on the tip of my tongue
Like a cube of sugar
Got a rush and I can't get enough
Because there's something about you
Got me deep in love (love)

And the feeling won't stop
Because I'm fire red hot
Like I'm ready to pop
And I'm spinning around
With this passion I found
Oh here I go again
I can feel it coming

And it's like a flash of night
Inside there's something going on
Exploding inside me like a cherry bomb
And the thought of you
Fills me with a sweet surprise
Come to me tonight (babe, babe)
I'm feeling dynamite (babe, babe)
My heart is a delicious cherry bomb
Cherry bomb, bomb
Cherry bomb
Cherry bomb
Cherry bomb

And it's like a flash of night
Inside there's something going on
Exploding inside me like a cherry bomb
And the thought of you
Fills me with a sweet surprise
Come to me tonight (babe, babe)
I'm feeling dynamite (babe, babe)
My heart is a delicious cherry bombEmbed
