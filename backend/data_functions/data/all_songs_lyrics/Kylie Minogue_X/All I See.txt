All I See Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Weekend has arrived
Everybody's tryna find something to get into
My friends wanna go out, but I can't cancel my plans
Got a date with my baby
He's picking me up, so I'm gonna catch up with you
Some other day, gotta go
Can't make him wait tonight

Have to make sure I'm looking hot
'Cause we're going to our favorite spot
Till the morning we're gonna rock
Boy, you knock me out, yeah

My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song, dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feeling like I did when I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart in two
'Cause all I see is you (Is you, is you, is you, is you)
I get lost in time when I'm looking in your eyes
And we're body to body
I don't want you to rush
'Cause you're feeling like heaven to me
Follow the rhythm and keep it real close
In the dark, everything goes
Nothing's better than your touch
Don't stop, baby, 'cause we've just begun

Have to make sure I'm looking hot
'Cause we're going to our favorite spot
Till the morning we're going to rock
Boy, you knock me out, yeah

My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song, dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feeling like I did when I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart in two
'Cause all I see is you
Oh, oh, oh
Please don't let me go
My love for you's growing more and more and more
As we move across the floor, oh, oh
'Cause all I see is you (Is you, is you, is you, is you)
'Cause all I see is you (Is you, is you, is you)
DJ, spin my record again

My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song, dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feeling like I did when I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart in two
'Cause all I see is you
My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song, dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feeling like I did when I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart in two
'Cause all I see is you (Is you, is you, is you, is you)Embed
