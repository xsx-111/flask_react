Nu-di-ty Lyrics
I like it
Nu-nu-di-di-di-ty
Let me, let me see
Nu-di-ty

Hang your coat up, hang your coat up
Lock the doors up, lock the doors up
Let the steam rise in the spotlight (Alright, alright, alright)
Are you ready to let it go tonight? (Tonight, tonight)
Do your own thing with your own thing (Thing)
Ooh, shake your hip bone
Getting full swing
Who, ooh, who cares watching now?
Look, looking, looking, wow

Flash it in, fashion with me
Skin to skin, body to body (Body, body, body)
Dare to bare, let me, let me see
Nu-di-ty
Nu-nu-di-di-di-ty
Nu-di-ty

Ooh, time to strip down, time to strip down
Ooh, just pop that zipper for me
And whip that thing out
Just expose it 'cause you know it's, alright (Alright)
Are you ready to let it go tonight? (Tonight, night)
Let go, here we go
Just let it slip and slide (Slide)
Ooh, that's right, here we go
One button at a time
Who cares who sees tonight?
Look, looking, looking, wow
Flash it in, fashion with me
Skin to skin, body to body
Dare to bare, let me, let me see
Nu-di-ty

Who, who
Let me, let me, let me see
Let, le
Nudity
Nu-di-ty
Nu-nu-di-di-di-ty
Let me, let me see
Nu-di-ty
Let me, let me see
Nudity
Nu-di-ty

Flash it in, fashion with me
Skin to skin, body to body
Dare to bare, let me, let me see
Nu-di-ty

Nu-nu-di-di-di-ty
Nu-di-ty
Nu-nu-di-di-di-ty
Nu-di-ty
