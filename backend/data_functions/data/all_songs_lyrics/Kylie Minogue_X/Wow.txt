Wow Lyrics
Read my lips, I'm into you, I'm into you
I can't resist, you're so hot (Get me into the shade)
The spotlight's on, you creep into it, you like it and
Just the way that you dance
Just the way that you dance

(Yeah, yeah) Is enough to melt me baby
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Is enough to send me crazy
(Yeah, yeah) Such an angelic motion
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) You know you're made in heaven

From the way you walk
From the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire (Desire)
You're such a rush (Rush), the rush is never ending
Now, you've got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
You've got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow

The more I try, I try to stop
The more I can feel my antenna just sensing you up
And what can I do? I'm into you, I'm into you
Love the way that you move
Just love the way that you move
(Yeah, yeah) Such angelic motion
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) You know you're made in heaven

From the way you walk
From the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire (Desire)
You're such a rush (Rush), the rush is never ending
Now, you've got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
You've got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow

Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh

From the way you walk
From the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire (Desire)
You're such a rush (Rush), the rush is never ending
Now, you've got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
From the way you walk
From the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire (Desire)
You're such a rush (Rush), the rush is never ending
Now, you've got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
You've got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
