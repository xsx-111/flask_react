Like a Drug Lyrics
Boy, yeah, you got it, got it
You got me feeling crazy about my body
I, I cannot, cannot stop it
You got me moving, got me rocking, rocking

Make me feel like I can make it real
You got me hooked, get me on the floor
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please, I want more
Make me feel like I can make it real
You got me hooked, get me on the floor
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please, I want more

Dance like I'm the only, only
Like I'm the only lady like you want me
Damn right, I have my radar on you
So let's get physical, I want to, want to

Make me feel like I can make it real
You got me hooked, get me on the floor
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please, I want more

Never had a ride as delicate and fine
You really blow my mind
When we rock, when we rock
I really wanna do, everything with you
The things you make me do
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug
Make me feel like I can make it real
You got me hooked, get me on the floor
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please, I want more
Make me feel like I can make it real
You got me hooked, get me on the floor
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please, I want more

Never had a ride as delicate and fine
You really blow my mind
When we rock, when we rock
I really wanna do, everything with you
The things you make me do
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug3Embed
