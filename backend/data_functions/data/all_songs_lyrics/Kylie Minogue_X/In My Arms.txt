In My Arms Lyrics
How do you describe a feeling?
I've only ever dreamt of this
Oh

DJ's spinning up my favorite song
Hurry up and get a groove on
Life fantastic, and it won't be long
Don't let the moment slip away

'Cause you and I could find a pleasure
No one else has ever known
Feels like it is now or never
Don't wanna be alone

How does it feel in my arms?
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it? Do you need it?
Can you feel it? Tell me
How does it feel in my arms?

Got a feeling this is something strong
All I want to do is move on
No more wondering where I belong
So never go away
'Cause you and I are guilty pleasure
No one else has ever known
Feels like it is now or never
Don't want to be alone

How does it feel in my arms?
(How does it feel in my arms?)
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it? Do you need it?
Can you feel it? Tell me
How does it feel in my arms?

Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Oh yeah, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Oh yeah, yeah
I'm listening

How does it feel in my arms?
(How does it feel in my arms?)
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it? Do you need it?
Can you feel it? Tell me (Oh)
How does it feel in my arms?29Embed
