Speakerphone Lyrics
(Music make you lose control)
Lights, mind, eyes, hearts

Lights (flashing), sound (clashing)
Mind (blowing), body (rocking)
Eyes (locking), lips (touching)
Hearts (pumping), pressure (rising)
Breath (taking), rump (shaking)
Music (make you), lose (control)
Playing on your speakerphone
Track repeat go on and on

Drop your socks and grab your mini boombox
Do the pop lock, body rock, let the beat drop
Till you're shell shocked, baby, what?
Tell me what you got
Rock hard like a cinder block

Through your head bone, temple bone
Through your jaw bone
To your neck bone, collar bone, let it go on
To your back bone, moving on through your hip bone
When you're playing on your speakerphone
Track repeat go on and on
Lights (flashing), sound (clashing)
Mind (blowing), body (rocking)
Eyes (locking), lips (touching)
Hearts (pumping), pressure (rising)
Breath (taking), rump (shaking)
Music (make you), lose (control)
Playing on your speakerphone
Track repeat go on and on

With your friend or on your own
On the street or in your home
Feel the buzz and hum along
Playing on your speakerphone
Let the stars collide

Stop your pockets going ring-a-ding-dong
Turn your thing on speakerphone
We can get it on
Set your mind on freaky mode
Where you wanna go?
Feel the buzz grow
Let it blow
Through your head bone, temple bone
Through your jaw bone
To your neck bone, collar bone, let it go on
To your back bone, moving on through your hip bone
When you're playing on your speakerphone
Track repeat go on and on

Lights (flashing), sound (clashing)
Mind (blowing), body (rocking)
Eyes (locking), lips (touching)
Hearts (pumping), pressure (rising)
Breath (taking), rump (shaking)
Music (make you), lose (control)
Playing on your speakerphone
Track repeat go on and on
With your friend or on your own
On the street or in your home
Feel the buzz and hum along
Playing on your speakerphone
Let the stars collide

Drop your socks and grab your mini boombox, box, box, box, box (let the beat drop)
Drop your socks and grab your mini boombox
Do the pop lock body rock
Let the beat drop, drop, drop
Drop your socks and grab your mini boombox, box, box
Playing on your speakerphone
Lights (flashing), sound (clashing)
Mind (blowing), body (rocking)
Eyes (locking), lips (touching)
Hearts (pumping), pressure (rising)
Breath (taking), rump (shaking)
Music (make you), lose (control)
Playing on your speakerphone
Track repeat go on and on
Let the stars collide1Embed
