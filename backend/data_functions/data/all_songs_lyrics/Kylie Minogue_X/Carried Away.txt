Carried Away Lyrics
Time slipping through an hourglass
When I see you now
I forget the past
Can't help feeling delirious
Are you ready now?
Let's talk serious
I can't keep up false appearances
And I, when you dance close to me, it's just too sexy

I'm carried away in your arms right now
I'd do it all again in a beat of my heart
Secretly, I'm craving for you now
I feel it turning around
I feel it turning around
I feel it turning around
I feel it turning around

I really think you know me well
I think you can tell
I see it in your eyes
Must be written in the universe
It was meant to be
Missing you just hurts me
I can feel like you could be the one
Tonight, the heat of the dance floor's just too sexy
I'm carried away in your arms right now
I'd do it all again in a beat of my heart
Secretly, I'm craving for you now
I feel it turning around
I feel it turning around
I feel it turning around
I feel it turning around

Baby, it's been such a long time
It's crazy but it's true

I'm carried away in your arms right now
I'd do it all again in a beat of my heart
Secretly, I'm craving for you now
I'm carried away in your arms right now
I'd do it all again in a beat of my heart
Secretly, I'm craving for you now
I feel it turning around
I feel it turning around
I feel it turning around
I feel it turning aroundEmbed
