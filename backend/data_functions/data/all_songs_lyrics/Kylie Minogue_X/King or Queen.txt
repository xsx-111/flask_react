King or Queen Lyrics
You stand around the edge
Looking tip-top, but you forget
That when I look at you
Baby, I see so much more you could do
Oh, come to me
You'd look good in company
And your wish is my command
All you got to do is take my hand
Come to me, come to me
Don't you understand?

That body was made for dancing
So follow me down this way
Come on, now twist it
Turn it, turn it
Push it, burn it, burn it
Made for dancing
Totally designed to shake
So come on, now twist it
Turn it, turn it
Push it, burn it, burn it

Dress up, look the part
Tie your name up on my heart
Don't be so shy about it
Don't get uptight about it
Move close, can't you see?
You know you're going to feel good next to me
Because oh, oh, don't you know?
That body was made for dancing
So follow me down this way
Come on, now twist it
Turn it, turn it
Push it, burn it, burn it
Made for dancing
Totally designed to shake
So come on, now twist it
Turn it, turn it
Push it, burn it, burn it

Dancefloor royalty
Famous on the disco scene
Royalty unquavering
Be my king or queen
King or queen
Famous on the disco scene
Dancefloor royalty
That's what you are to me
I salute you

That body was made for dancing
So follow me down this way
Come on, now twist it
Turn it, turn it
Push it, burn it, burn it
Made for dancing
Totally designed to shake
So come on, now twist it
Turn it, turn it
Push it, burn it, burn it
Dancefloor royalty
Famous on the disco scene
Royalty unquavering
Be my king or queen1Embed
