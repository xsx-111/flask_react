2 Hearts Lyrics
You make me invisible
Like the sky, you make my day
I feel so wonderful
Oh, oh, oh, don't let go
I'm deep in the dark of you
It feels like I never saw the sun
Should I shout for a rescue
Oh, oh, oh, don't let go
Oh, oh, oh, don't let go

Two hearts are beating together
I'm in love (Woo), I'm in love (Woo)
Is this forever and ever?
I'm in love (Woo), I'm in love (Woo)
Two hearts are beating together
I'm in love (Woo), I'm in love (Woo)
Is this forever and ever?
I'm in love (Woo), I'm in love (Woo)

Looks good in the sunshine
Well, hold on 'cause I'm coming up for air
And I can't even see up here
Oh, oh, oh, don't let go
Oh, oh, oh, don't let go
Two hearts are beating together
I'm in love (Woo), I'm in love (Woo)
Is this forever and ever?
I'm in love (Woo), I'm in love (Woo)
Two hearts are beating together
I'm in love (Woo), I'm in love (Woo)
Is this forever and ever?
I'm in love (Woo), I'm in love (Woo)
Two hearts (Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh)
I'm in love (Woo), I'm in love (Woo)
Is this forever and ever?
I'm in love (Woo), I'm in love (Woo)
Two hearts (Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh)1Embed
