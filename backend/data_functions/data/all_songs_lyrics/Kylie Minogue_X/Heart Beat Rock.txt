Heart Beat Rock Lyrics
Lovers in the backseat
Boys in the back street
Girls in their tight wash
Figure hugging blue jeans
They're looking like they want
To show off what they got
Their feet are itching to dance
Their bodies ready to rock

Now, I've been around the world
But I'm not those other girls
I'm feeling special, do you like what you see?
'Cause I got my best dress on
Can I be your fantasy?

('Cause I can make your heartbeat rock)
I can make your heartbeat rock
I can make your heartbeat rock
(I can make your heartbeat rock)
I can make your heartbeat rock, ooh, ooh
Baby, show me what you got
Baby, show me what you got
(I can make you so damn hot)
I can make you so damn hot
Because I can make your heart beat
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ladies in the spotlight
Boys are checking their tight
Skirts out while their hips sway
Bumping to the hot track
People take a step back
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

('Cause I can make your heartbeat rock)
I can make your heartbeat rock
I can make your heartbeat rock
(I can make your heartbeat rock)
I can make your heartbeat rock, ooh, ooh
Baby, show me what you got
Baby, show me what you got
(I can make you so damn hot)
I can make you so damn hot
'Cause I can make your heart beat
'Cause I can make your heart beat

I've been around the world
But I'm not those other girls
I'm feeling special, do you like what you see?
Because I got my best dress on
Can I be your fantasy?
('Cause I can make your heartbeat rock)
I can make your heartbeat rock
I can make your heartbeat rock
(I can make your heartbeat rock)
I can make your heartbeat rock, ooh, ooh
Baby, show me what you got
Baby, show me what you got
(I can make you so damn hot)
I can make you so damn hot
'Cause I can make your heart beat
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
'Cause I can make your heart beat
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
'Cause I can make your heart beat
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah2Embed
