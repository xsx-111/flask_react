Do It Again Lyrics
Can you all see this?
The flowers blooming
Or am I trapped in a haze?
And maybe it's just me
I know I'm foolish
Here I go falling again

'Cause I can't help myself
I just can't wait
It's like the rhythm of it keeps me awake
And who cares if it breaks
Down to heartache?
I'm ready to fall

I get a feeling, it's like a shiver
I feel the butterflies inside, I can't let go
I'd do it again, I'd do it again
It's an explosion, I keep on dancing
I feel it taking over me and then I know
I'd do it again, I'd do it again

Can't help but wonder
I'm in my own world
And it's a beautiful place
I know that I've cried
My share of teardrops
See the sore lines on my face
Cause I can't help myself
I just can't wait
It's like the rhythm of it keeps me awake
And who cares if it breaks
Down to heartache?
I'm ready to fall (I'm ready to fall)

I get a feeling, it's like a shiver
I feel the butterflies inside, I can't let go
I'd do it again, I'd do it again
It's an explosion, I keep on dancing
I feel it taking over me and then I know
I'd do it again, I'd do it again
I'd do it again

It's fireworks
Fantastic
It tears you apart but it's magic
It's a first kiss, the last dance
Pulls me in every time
Oh

I get a feeling, it's like a shiver
I feel the butterflies inside, I can't let go
I'd do it again, I'd do it again
It's an explosion, I keep on dancing
I feel it taking over me and then I know
I'd do it again, I'd do it again1Embed
