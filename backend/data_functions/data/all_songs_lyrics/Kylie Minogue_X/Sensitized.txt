Sensitized Lyrics
Sensitized by every word that you say
Boy, you got me messed up but I like it that way
Tantalized, just too good to refuse
When I try to stop you
You keep blowing my fuse

Can't deny how hot I'm feeling
If my body could fly I'd hit the ceiling 'cause I

Can't hold back, the minute I try
Baby, you trip the switch and I'm sensitized
Every touch, whatever you do
Baby, you trip the switch, I turn on for you
I turn on for you

Energized by all the pleasure and pain
Boy, you got that something
That burns a spark to the flame
Look at me, you got me begging for more
Because you got that one thing
I ain't discovered before
Can't deny how rude I'm feeling
If my body could talk you'd hear me screaming 'cause I

Can't hold back, the minute I try
Baby, you trip the switch and I'm sensitized
Every touch, whatever you do
Baby, you trip the switch, I turn on for you
I turn on for you

I'm sensitized tonight (I'm sensitized)
And you can watch me come alive
I'm sensitized tonight
And you can watch me come alive
I'm sensitized tonight
And you can watch me come alive
(I'm sensitized) I'm sensitized tonight
I'm sensitized tonight

Can't hold back, the minute I try
Baby, you trip the switch and I'm sensitized
Every touch, whatever you do
Baby, you trip the switch, I turn on for you
I turn on for you
I can't hold back, the minute I try
Baby, you trip the switch and I'm sensitized
Every touch, whatever you do
Baby, you trip the switch, I turn on for you
I turn on for you
I come alive
Baby, you know it's true, I feel this for you
I come alive
Baby, you know it's true, I feel this for you
I come alive
I come alive1Embed
