Stars Lyrics
You're asking yourself, what's real?
What to do with these feelings
That you have inside surreal
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When you look deep into the pockets of the universe

You never know what you find
Because stars don't shine in singular places
Open up your mind's eye and
Light up familiar faces
Because in time
You'll find life and all of its graces
So open up your mind's eye
And go tonight, begin to feel the light

How do we know the truth?
Gotta look to the root
Inside the meaning of life for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When you look deep into the pockets of the universe
You never know what you find
Because stars don't shine in singular places
Open up your mind's eye and
Light up familiar faces
Because in time
You'll find life and all of its races
So open up your mind's eye
And go tonight, begin to feel the light

Begin to feel
Begin to feel
Stars don't shine
Stars don't shine
Stars don't shine
Stars don't shine
Stars don't shine

You never know what you find
Because stars don't shine in singular places
Open up your mind's eye and
Light up familiar faces
Because in time
You'll find life and all of its races
So open up your mind's eye
And go tonight, begin to feel the light
Go tonight, go tonight, go tonight
Go tonight, go tonight, go tonight
Yeah, familiar faces
Go tonight, go tonight, go tonightEmbed
