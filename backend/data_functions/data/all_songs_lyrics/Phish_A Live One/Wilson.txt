Wilson Lyrics
The two rode on in silence, deeper and deeper into the heart of the forest until they came to the outskirts of a small community. Tela explained to Forbin that they had reached the base of the revolutionaries. The colonel looked up and there in the center of the clearing stood Errand Wolfe. He was a small man but his presence was overpowering. He seemed to emit a kind of violent energy that sent chills down the colonel's spine. And as the multi-beast moved towards him, he raised his fist in anger, and his voice filled the forest

Oh out near Stonehenge, I lived alone
Oh out near Gamehendge, I chafed a bone

Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
Wilson, Duke of Lizards
I beg it all trune for you

Talk my duke a mountain, Helping Friendly Book
Inasfar as fiefdom, I think you bad crook

Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
Wilson, Duke of Lizards
I beg it all trune for you

I talked to my son Roger, Rutherford the same
When we had that meeting, over down near Game(hendge)

Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
Wilson, Duke of Lizards
I beg it all trune for you
You got me back thinkin' that you're the worst one
I must inquire, Wilson
Can you still have fun?
Wilson
Can you still have fun?
Wilson
Can you still have fun?
