Gumbo LyricsThere's a mouse starin' out of the window
His colony's trapped in the snow
He's planning a family vacation
But he just can't go
Around the next corner's a red bird
His feathers are trapped in a sling
He's passed by some mudslinging parrot
Who's jealously ain't got no end
There ain't no time to stash the gumbo
Or rattle around in a cage
The sacrificed child's made bubbles
And spittle is everywhere enraged
In the hot sand I land on my feet
They blister and cake with debris
Chez rolez is guarding the toll port
While Angry piddles with glee
There's a fool writing notes out on sandpaper
He's sending them off to himself
He gets them a couple days later
Who put them along his top shelf
If you get tired of shavings
And carve up a good hunk of wood
Remembering to check on the sausage
He's got cooking somewhere look goodEmbed
