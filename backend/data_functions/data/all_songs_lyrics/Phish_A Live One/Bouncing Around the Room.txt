Bouncing Around the Room Lyrics
The woman was a dream I had
Though rather hard to keep
For when my eyes were watching hers, they closed, and I was still asleep
For when my hand was holding hers

She whispered words and I awoke
And faintly bouncing 'round the room
The echo of whomever spoke
And I awoke, and faintly bouncing 'round the room
The echo of whomever spoke

The place I sought was far beneath, the surface of the sea
My sight was poor, but I was sure
The sirens sang their song for me
They dance above me as I sink

I see them through a crystal haze
And hear the bouncing 'round the room
The neverending coral maze
The crystal haze
And hear the bouncing 'round the room
The neverending coral maze
Then before and now once more, I'm bouncing 'round the room
That time then and once again, I'm bouncing 'round the room
That time then and once again, I'm bouncing 'round the room
That time then and once again, I'm bouncing 'round the room
That time then and once again, I'm bouncing 'round the room

And I awoke, faintly bouncing 'round the room
The echo of whomever spoke
And I awoke, faintly bouncing 'round the room
The echo of whomever spoke
And I awoke, faintly bouncing 'round the room
The echo of whomever spoke1Embed
