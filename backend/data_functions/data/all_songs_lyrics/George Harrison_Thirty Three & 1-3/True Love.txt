True Love Lyrics
You give to me and I give to you
True love, it's a true love
And on and on, it will always be
True love, true love

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give to me and to give to you
A love, forever true
It's a love, forever true

True love, it's a true love
True love, true love

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give to me and to give to you
A love, forever true
A love, forever true
It's a love, forever trueEmbed
