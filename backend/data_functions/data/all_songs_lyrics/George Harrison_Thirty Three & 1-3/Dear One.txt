Dear One Lyrics
Dear one, near me, truth assessed
Reborn world wise, mind at rest
True heart sow you, God has blessed
Your soul whispers, love confessed

My spirit sings to you now
Creation stands at your feet
My feelings call to you now
Dear one, I love you
You hear my spirit sing to you
You see creation at your feet
You feel my feelings calling you
You know, dear one, I love you

Dear one, show me simple grace
Move me toward thee with each pace

My spirit sings to you now
Creation stands at your feet
My feelings call to you now
Dear one, I love you
You hear my spirit sing to you
You see creation at your feet
You feel my feelings calling you
You know, dear one, I love you


My spirit sings to you now
Creation stands at your feet
My feelings call to you now
Dear one, I love you
You hear my spirit sing to you
You see creation at your feet
You feel my feelings calling you
You know, dear one, I love you1Embed
