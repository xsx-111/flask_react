Pure Smokey Lyrics
Smokey, Smokey

Throughout my lifetimes, I'd hesitate
I'd feel some joy
But before I'd show my thanks
It became too late, ooh
But now all the way
I want to find the time and stop to say
I want to thank you Lord
For giving us each new day

And thinking back over so many years
Love that's filled my ears
I want to thank you Lord
For giving us pure Smokey, ooh ooh
And anyone who hears that voice so free
He really got a hold on me
And I thank you Lord
For giving to us pure Smokey, pure Smokey
Smokey, pure Smokey

(Thank you Lord)
He's singing it so sweetly like no one else could do
Always trying something new
And I thank you Lord
For giving us pure Smokey
And anyone who hears, hears that voice so free
He really got a hold on me
And I thank you Lord
For giving to us pure Smokey, Smokey
Ooh ooh

Thank you Lord2Embed
