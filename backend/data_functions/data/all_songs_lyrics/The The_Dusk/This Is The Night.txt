This Is The Night Lyrics
I'm scared of the things I think of
When night comes along
Something gets hold of me
Something I can't see

Oh, it's a wicked world
Awaits the ones our young girls bear
Oh, I need somebody to hold me
In the fading light of this coming night
In the fading light of this coming night

How many whores have walked through that door?
Lain by my side and climbed in my mind?
And taken me down
To where the heat
Blisters the skin upon my feet
Makes me reach out and weep
For the days when I was pure of heart
And slept in peace


Oh, it's a wicked world
Awaits the ones our young girls bear
Oh, I need somebody to hold me
In the fading light of this coming night
In the fading light
This coming night

In the fading light
Of this coming night
In the fading light
This is the nightEmbed
