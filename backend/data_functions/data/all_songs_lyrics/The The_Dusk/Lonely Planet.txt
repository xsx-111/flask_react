Lonely Planet Lyrics
Planet Earth is slowing down
Overseas, underground
Wherever you look around
Lord, take me by the hand
Lead me through these desert sands
To the shores of a promised land

You make me start when you look into my heart
And see me for who I really am

If you can't change the world, change yourself
If you can't change the world, change yourself
If you can't change the world, change yourself
If you can't change the world, change yourself

I didn't care if the sun didn't shine
And the rain didn't fall from the sky
I just cared about myself
From this world to the next
And from the next back to this
By our actions we are bound
We're running out of love
Running out of hate
Running out of space for the human race
Planet Earth is slowing down
You make me cry when you look into my eyes
And see me for who I really am

If you can't change the world, change yourself
If you can't change the world, change yourself
If you can't change the world, change yourself
If you can't change the world, change yourself
If you can't change the world, change yourself
If you can't change the world, change yourself
If you can't change the world, change yourself
And if you can't change yourself then change your world

I'm in love with the planet I'm standing on
I can't stop
I can't stop thinking of
All the people I've ever loved
All the people I have lost
All the people I'll never know
All the feelings I've never shown
The world's too big, and life's too short
The world's too big, and life's too short
The world's too big, and life's too short
To be alone, to be aloneEmbed
