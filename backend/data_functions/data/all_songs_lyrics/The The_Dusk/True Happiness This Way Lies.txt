True Happiness This Way Lies Lyrics
Hey man, I got what you need
And have you ever wanted something so badly
That it possessed your body and your soul
Through the night and through the day
Until you finally get it
And then you realize that it wasn't what you wanted after all
And then those selfsame sickly little thoughts
Now go and attach themselves to something or somebody new
And the whole goddamn thing starts all over again

Well, I've been crushing the symptoms
But I can't locate the cause
Could God really be so cruel?
To give us feelings that could never be fulfilled
Baby, I've got my sights set on you, I've got my sight set on you
And someday, someday, someday, you'll come my way
But when you put your arms around me
I'll be lookin' over your shoulder for somethin' new

Cause I ain't ever found peace upon the breast of a girl
I ain't ever found peace with the religion of the world
I ain't ever found peace at the bottom of a glass
Sometimes it seems the more I ask for, the less I receive
Sometimes it seems the more I ask for, the less I receive
The only true freedom is freedom from the heart's desires
And the only true happiness this way liesEmbed
