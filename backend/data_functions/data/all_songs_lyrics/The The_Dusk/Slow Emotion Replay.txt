Slow Emotion Replay Lyrics
The more I see, the less I know
About all the things I thought were wrong or right
And carved in stone
So, don't ask me about war, religion, or God
Love, sex, or death, because

Everybody knows what's going wrong with the world
But I don't even know what's going on in myself
Everybody knows what's going wrong with the world
I don't even know what's going on in myself

You've gotta work out your own salvation
With no explanation to this Earth we fall
On hands and knees we crawl
And we look up to the stars and we reach out and pray
To a deaf, dumb and blind God who never explains

Everybody knows what's going wrong with the world
I don't even know what's going on in myself
Everybody knows what's going wrong with the world
But I don't even know what's going on in myself
Everybody knows what's going wrong with the world
I don't even know what's going on in myself
Lord, I've been here for so long
I can feel it coming down on me
I'm just a slow emotion replay
Of somebody I used to be
Lord, I've been here for so long
I can feel it coming down on me
I'm just a slow emotion replay
Of somebody I used to be2Embed
