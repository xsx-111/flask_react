Bluer Than Midnight Lyrics
Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me

The candles are lit, the curtains are drawn
There's still no sign of rain nor dawn
Our lips touch, our limbs entwine
But the ghosts that haunt me won't leave my mind

Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, from myself

One sin leads to another one
Oh, the harder I try
I can never, never, never find peace in this life
I ask myself where does lust come from
Is it something to yield to or be overcome
I ask myself
Why love can never touch my heart like fear does
Why can't love ever touch my heart like fear does?Embed
