Sodium Light Baby Lyrics
As I sat in the back of that old taxi cab
Waitin' for the evening to come
On every street of this city
I heard you call my name

You're the strangest feeling I ever had
The strangest feeling
You're the strangest feeling I ever had
The strangest feeling

From the day that we are born
Until the day we die
We are hostage to our hearts' desire
And though I ride this city
I can't escape from you
And when I look up to the stars I wonder
Can the world really be so cruel?

You're the strangest feeling I ever had
The strangest feeling
You're the strangest feeling I ever had
The strangest feeling
Tonight the wolves are howling
I can't escape from you
A yearning past denying
I will surrender to

You're the strangest feeling I ever had
The strangest feeling
You're the strangest feeling I ever had
The strangest feeling

Shine on me, sodium light baby
Shine on me, sodium light baby
Shine on me, sodium light baby
Shine on me, sodium light babyEmbed
