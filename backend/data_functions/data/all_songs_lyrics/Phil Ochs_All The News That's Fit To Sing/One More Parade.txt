One More Parade Lyrics
Hup, two, three, four, marching down the street
Rolling of the drums and the tramping of the feet
General salutes and mothers wave and weep
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid
Price is paid
One more parade

So young, so strong, so ready for the war
So willing to go and die upon a foreign shore
All march together, everybody looks the same
So there is no one you can blame
Don't be ashamed
Light the flame
One more parade

Listen for the sound and listen for the noise
Listen for the thunder of the marching boys
Few years ago their guns were only toys
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid
Price is paid
One more parade
So young, so strong, so ready for the war
So willing to go and die upon a foreign shore
All march together, everybody looks the same
So there is no one you can blame
Don't be ashamed
Light the flame
One more parade

Medals on their coats and guns in their hands
Trained to kill as they're trained to stand
Ten thousand ears need only one command
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid
Price is paid
One more parade

So young, so strong, so ready for the war
So willing to go and die upon a foreign shore
All march together, everybody looks the same
So there's no one you can blame
Don't be ashamed
Light the flame
One more parade
Cold hard stares on faces so proud
Kisses from the girls and cheers from the crowd
And the widows from the last war cry into their shrouds
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid
Price is paid
Don't be ashamed
War's a game
World in flames
So start the paradeEmbed
