The Thresher Lyrics
In Portsmouth town on the eastern shore
Where many a fine ship was born
The Thresher was built
And the Thresher was launched
And the crew of the Thresher was sworn
She was shaped like a tear
She was built like a shark
She was made to run fast and free
And the builders shook their hands
And the builders shared their wine
Thought that they had mastered the sea

Yes, she'll always run silent
And she'll always run deep
Though the ocean has no pity
Though the waves will never weep
They'll never weep

And they marveled at her speed
And they marveled at her depth
They marveled at her deadly design
And they sailed to every land
And they sailed to every port
Just to see what faults they could find
Then they put her on the land
For nine months to stand
And they worked on her from stem to stern
But they could never see
It was their coffin to be
For the sea was waiting for their return
Yes, she'll always run silent
And she'll always run deep
Though the ocean has no pity
Though the waves will never weep
They'll never weep

On a cold Wednesday morn
They put her her out to sea
When the waves they were nine feet high
And they dove beneath the waves
And they dove to their graves
And they never said a last goodbye
And its deeper and deeper
And deeper they dove
Just to see what their ship could stand
But the hull gave a moan
And the hull gave a groan
And they plunged to the deepest darkest sand
Now she lies in the depths
Of the darkened ocean floor
Covered by the waters cold and still
Oh, can't you see the wrong
She was a death ship all along
Died before she had a chance to kill
And she'll never run silent
And she'll never run deep
For the ocean had no pity
And the waves, they never weep
They never weepEmbed
