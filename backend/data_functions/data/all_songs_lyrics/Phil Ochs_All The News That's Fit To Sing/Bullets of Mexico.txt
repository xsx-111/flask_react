Bullets of Mexico Lyrics
The peons of Mexico long have known suffering and pain
Zapata and Villa have died there, fighting in vain
Ruben Jaramillo kept up the tradition
He fought for the land once again
He lived for the land, and there on the land he was slain

Forty-five bullet has ended the life
Of a man who had lived by the gun
But all of the bullets of Mexico
Cannot undo all the work that he's done

The greedy capiques have stolen and plundered the land
With pistoleros they ruled with a cold iron hand
The poor campesinos could stand it no longer
Resistance was starting to grow
Jaramillo decided to fight for a new Mexico

Forty-five bullet has ended the life
Of a man who had lived by the gun
But all of the bullets of Mexico
Cannot undo all the work that he's done
For twenty long years he fought and he struggled and tried
Epifania, his wife, always there at his side
Often surrounded, he always was hounded
They searched for him near, far, and wide
A man of deep sorrow, but also a man of deep pride

Forty-five bullet has ended the life
Of a man who had lived by the gun
But all of the bullets of Mexico
Cannot undo all the work that he's done

Two thousand peasants he led to their long-promised land
And the army's revenge killed the wife and the sons and the man
The assassins rejoiced with their whiskey and women
They laughed and they danced on his grave
Now the land waits again for another to ride on the waves

Forty-five bullet has ended the life
Of a man who had lived by the gun
But all of the bullets of Mexico
Cannot undo all the work that he's doneEmbed
