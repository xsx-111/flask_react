Knock on the Door Lyrics
In many a time, in many a land
With many a gun in many a hand
They came by the night, they came by the day
Came with their guns to take us away

With a knock on the door, knock on the door
Here they come to take one more
One more

Back in the days of the Roman Empire
They died by the cross and they died by the fire
In the stone coliseum, the crowd gave a roar
And it all began with that knock on the door

Just a knock on the door, knock on the door
Here they come to take one more
One more

The years have all passed, we've reached modern times
The Nazis have come with their Nazi war crimes
Yes the power was there, the power was found
Six million people have heard that same sound
That old knock on the door, knock on the door
Here they come to take one more
One more

Now there's many new words and many new names
The banners have changed but the knock is the same
On the Soviet shores with right on their side
I wonder who knows how many have died

With their knock on the door, knock on the door
Here they come to take one more
One more

Look over the oceans, look over the lands
Look over the leaders with the blood on their hands
And open your eyes and see what they do
When they knock over their friend they're knocking for you

With their knock on the door, knock on the door
Here they come to take one more
With their knock on the door, knock on the door
Here they come to take one more
One moreEmbed
