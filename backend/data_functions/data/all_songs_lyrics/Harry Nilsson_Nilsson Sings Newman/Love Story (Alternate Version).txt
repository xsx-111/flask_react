Love Story (Alternate Version) Lyrics
I like your brother
I like your mother
I like you
And you like me, too
We'll get a preacher
I'll buy a ring
We'll hire a band
With an accordion
And a violin
And a tenor who can sing

You and me, you and me
Baby, you and me
You and me, you and me
Baby, you and me
You and me, you and me
Baby, you and me
You and me, you and me, baby

We'll have a kid
Or maybe we'll rent one
He's got to be straight
'Cause I don't want a bent one
He'll drink his baby brew
From a big brass cup
Someday maybe president
If things loosen up
You and me, you and me
Baby, you and me
You and me, you and me
Baby, you and me
You and me, you and me
Baby, you and me
You and me, you and me, baby

I'll take the train
Into the city
Every morning
You may be plain
But I think you're pretty
In the morning
Some nights we'll go out dancing
If I'm not too tired
And some nights we'll sit romancing
Watching the late show by the fire

When our kids are grown
With kids of their own
They'll send us away
To a little home in Florida
And we'll play checkers all day
'Til we pass awayEmbed
