Vine Street Lyrics
My baby left this morning
With everything I had
She didn't give me no warning
And that's why I feel so bad
Oh, Anita, Anita
I need some sympathy
Anita, I love ya
Come and sit by me

That's the tape that we made
But I'm sad to say, it never made the grade
That was me, third guitar
I wonder where the others are?

Vine Street
We used to live there
On Vine Street

She made perfume
In the back of her room
While me and my group
Would sit out on the stoop
And we'd play for her
The songs she liked best
To have us play
On Vine Street
Vine Street
The crack of the backbeat
On Vine Street

Swingin' along
On the wings of a song
Lie in, secure
Self-righteous, and sure
Why, we've things to say
If the people would pay
To have us play
On Vine StreetEmbed
