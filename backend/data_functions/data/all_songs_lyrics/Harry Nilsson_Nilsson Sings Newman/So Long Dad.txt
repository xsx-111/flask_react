So Long Dad Lyrics
Home again
And the streets are not much cleaner
And the quaint old south side scenery
Is quaint no more
Just older than before
Go up the stairs and down the hallway
To my Daddy's door

Your son is home, dad
And he's found a girl
Well, she's the greatest girl
In all the world
I think you'll like her, Dad
I hope you do
But if you don't
That's all right, too

What's new
Do you still work at the drugstore?
Is that true?
Still polishing the same floor?
I miss my good old dad
My, but I'm glad to see ya
Home again
No, I won't be staying here, Dad
Come and see us, Papa
When you can
There'll always be a place
For my ol' man
Just drop by when it's convenient to
Be sure and call before you do

So long, Dad
So long, Dad (more first voices)
So long, Dad (a little more)
So long, Dad (actually, I need more current voice)
So long, Dad (forget the one that's saying more first voice)
So long, Dad
So long, Dad
So long, Dad
So long
So longEmbed
