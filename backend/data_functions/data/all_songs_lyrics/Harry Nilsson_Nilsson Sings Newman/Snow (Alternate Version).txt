Snow (Alternate Version) Lyrics
Snow
Fills the fields we used to know
And the little park where we
Would go
Sleeps far
Below
In the snow

Gone
It's all over and you're gone
But the memory lives on
Although
Our dreams
Lie buried
In the snow

Sometimes the wind blows
Through the trees
And I think I hear you
Calling me
But all I see
Is snow
Everywhere I go
As the cold winter sun
Sinks low
I walk
Alone
Through the snow

 "I think so."
 "That ending I'd play."
 "Yeah, no, maybe we can cut that in..."Embed
