Yellow Man Lyrics
Very far away
In a foreign land
Lives a yellow woman
And a yellow man
He's been around
For many a year
They say they were there
Before we were here

Eatin' rice all day (children play.)
While the children play (you see, he believes.)
You see, he believes (in the family.)
In the family (right.)
Just like you and me
Oh, yellow man
Yellow man
We understand
You know we understand

Dat dat dat dat dat dat dat dat da da
Dat dat dat dat dat dat dat dat da da
Dat dat dat dat dat dat dat dat da da
Dat dat da da
Keeps his money
Tight in his hand
With his yellow woman
He's a yellow man
Got to have a yellow woman
When you're a yellow manEmbed
