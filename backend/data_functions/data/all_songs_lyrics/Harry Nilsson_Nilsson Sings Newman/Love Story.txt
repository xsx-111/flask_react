Love Story Lyrics
I like your brother
And I like your mother
I like you
And you like me too
We'll get a preacher
And I'll buy a ring
We'll hire a band
With an accordion
And a violin
And a tenor who can sing

You and me
You and me, baby
You and me, you and me
You and me, baby
You and me, you and me
You and me, baby
You and me, you and me
You and me

We'll have a kid
Or maybe we'll rent one
He's got to be straight
'Cause we don't want no bent one
He'll drink his baby brew
From a big brass cup
Someday he may be president
If things loosen up
You and me
You and me, baby
You and me, you and me
You and me, baby
You and me, you and me
You and me, baby
You and me, you and me
You and me

I'll take the train
Into the city
Every morning
You may be plain
But I think you're pretty
In the morning
Some nights we'll go out dancin'
If I am not too tired
And some nights we'll sit romancin'
Watching the late show by the fire

When our kids are grown
With kids of their own
They'll send us away
To a little home in Florida
We'll play checkers all day
'Till we pass awayEmbed
