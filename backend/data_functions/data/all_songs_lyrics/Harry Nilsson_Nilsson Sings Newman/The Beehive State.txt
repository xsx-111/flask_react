The Beehive State Lyrics
Since you're the delegate from Kansas
Will you kindly take the floor
And tell us what is Kansas thinkin'
And what is Kansas for?

Well, Kansas is for the farmer
We stand behind the little man
And we need a firehouse in Topeka
So help us if you can

I see the gentleman from Utah
Our friendly Beehive State
How can we help you, Utah?
How can we make you great?

Well, we got to irrigate our desert
And we got to get some things to grow
And we gotta tell this country about Utah
'Cause nobody seems to knowEmbed
