Dayton, Ohio 1903 Lyrics
Sing a song
Of long ago
When things were green
And movin' slow
And people stopped to say hello
Well, they'd say hi to you

Would you like to come over for tea
With the missus and me?
It's a real nice way
To spend a day
In Dayton, Ohio
On a lazy Sunday afternoon
In 1903

Sing a song
Of long ago
When things could grow (put a lot of echo on it if you can)
And days flowed quietly
The air was clean
And you could see
And folks were nice to you
Would you like to come over for tea
With the missus and me?
It's a real nice way
To spend a day
In Dayton, Ohio
On a lazy Sunday afternoon
