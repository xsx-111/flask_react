Living Without You (Alternate Version) Lyrics
The milk truck hauls the sun up
And the paper hits the door
The subway shakes my floor
And I think about you
Time to face the dawning gray
Of another lonely day
It's so hard
Living without you

It's so hard
It's so hard
It's so hard
Living without you

Everyone's got something
They're out tryin' to get some more
They got something to get up for
But I ain't about to
Nothing's gonna happen
Nothing's gonna change
It's so hard
Living without you
So hard
It's so hard
Living without you

So hard
So hard
So hardEmbed
