Cowboy Lyrics
Cold, gray buildings
Where a hill should be
Steel and concrete
Closin' in on me
City faces haunt the places
I rode alone

Cowboy, cowboy
Can't run, can't hide
It's too late to fight now
Too tired to try

Wind that once blew free
Now scatters dust to the sky

Cowboy, cowboy
Can't run, can't hide
It's too late to fight now
Too tired to tryEmbed
