Living Without You Lyrics
The milk truck hauls the sun up
The paper hits the door
The subway shakes my floor
And I think about you
Time to face the dawning grey
Of another lonely day
It's so hard living without you

It's so hard
It's so hard
It's so hard living without you

Everyone's got something
They're trying to get some more
They got something to get up for
But I ain't about to
Nothin's gonna happen
Nothin's gonna change
It's so hard living without you

It's so hard
It's so hard
It's so hard living without you
So hard
So hard
So hardEmbed
