Cowboy (Alternate Version) Lyrics
Cold gray buildings
Where a hill should be
Steel and concrete
Closing in on me
City faces
Haunt the places
I rode alone

Cowboy
Cowboy
Can't run
Can't hide
It's too late to fight now
Too tired to try

Wind that once blew free
Now scatters dust to the sky

Cowboy
Cowboy
Can't run
Can't hide
It's too late to fight now
Too tired to tryEmbed
