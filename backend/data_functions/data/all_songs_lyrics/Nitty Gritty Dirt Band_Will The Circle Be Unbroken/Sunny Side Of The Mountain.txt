Sunny Side Of The Mountain LyricsDon't forget me little darling while I'm growing old and gray
Just a little thought before I'm going far away
I'll be waiting on the hillside where the wild red roses grow
On the sunny side of the mountains where the rippling waters flow
Don't forget about those days we courted many years ago
Don't forget all those promises you gave me and so
I'll be waiting on the hillside for the day you will call
On the sunny side of the mountain where the rippling waters fall
Please tell me darling in your letter do you think of me
Please answer little darling tell me where you can be
It's been so long since I've seen you but your love still lingers on
Don't forget me little darling though our love affair is goneEmbed
