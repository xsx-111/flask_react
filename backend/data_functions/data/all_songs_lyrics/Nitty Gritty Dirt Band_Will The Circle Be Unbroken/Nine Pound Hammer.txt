Nine Pound Hammer LyricsThis Nine Pound Hammer
Is a little too heavy
For my side, baby for my side
I'm a-goin' to the mountain
Gonna see my baby
But i ain't comin' back
No. I ain't comin' back
Roll on, buddy
Don't ya roll so slow
How, can I roll
When my wheels won't go
Well. it's a long way to Harlan
It's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew
Just to get a little brew
When I'm long gone
Don't you make my tombstone
Outta number nine coal
Outta number nine coalEmbed
