The End Of The World LyricsYou promised to love me to the end of the world
And I built a world just for two;
Now I'm alone at the end of the world
What good am I without you?
Gone are the vows that we made by the stars
Gone like a bolt from the blue;
Darlin' I'm lost at the end of the world
But what good am I without you?
Now yesterday's love is an old memory
Leaving me so heartsick and so blue;
But where can I turn at the end of the world
And what good is love without you?
So this is the end of a beautiful dream
A dream that can never come true;
I can't go on to the end of the world
For the end of my world's loving youEmbed
