The Precious Jewel LyricsWay back in the hills, when a boy, I once wandered
Buried deep in her grave lies a girl that I love
She was called from this earth, a jewel for heaven
More precious than diamonds more precious than gold
When a girl of sixteen, we courted each other
She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her to heaven one night
A jewel here on earth, a jewel up in heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam
This world has it wealth, its' trials and troubles
Mother earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
But it can't hold the soul of one precious jewel
She's resting in peace with the heavenly fold
May the angels have peace, God bless her in heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roamEmbed
