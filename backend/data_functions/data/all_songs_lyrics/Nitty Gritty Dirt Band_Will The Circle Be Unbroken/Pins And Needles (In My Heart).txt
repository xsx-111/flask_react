Pins And Needles (In My Heart) LyricsI know not where on earth to find you
I don't know how or where to start
I only know I'm here without you
And there's pins and needles in my heart
The days and nights are growin' longer
Since first you said that we must part
But now I know I can't forget you
I've got pins and needles in my heart
I always see your face before me
Your smile is heaven's work of art
But now you're smiling at another
And there's pins and needles in my heart
Someday, somewhere I'll find you
And love will make the teardrops start
And then you'll know how long I've waited
With these pins and needles in my heart...Embed
