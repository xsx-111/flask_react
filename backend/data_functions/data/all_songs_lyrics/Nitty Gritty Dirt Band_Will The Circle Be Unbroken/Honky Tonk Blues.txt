Honky Tonk Blues LyricsWell I left my home down on the rural route
I told my paw I'm going steppin out and get the
Honky tonk blues
Yeah the honky tonkblues
Well lord I got 'em
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues
Well I went to a dance and I wore out my shoes
Woke up this mornin wishin I could lose
Them jumpinhonky tonk blues
Yeah the honky tonk blues
Well lord I got 'em
I got the ho-on-ky tonkblues
Well I stopped into every place in town
This city life has really got me down
I gotthe honky tonk blues
Yeah the honky tonk blues
Welllord I got em
Got the ho-on-ky tonkblues
I'm gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm
And scat right back to my pappy's farm
And leave thesehonky tonk blues
Yeah the honky tonkblues
Well lord I got 'em
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues
When I get home to my Ma and Pa
I know they're gonna lay down the law
About the honky tonk blues
Them jumpin' honkty tonk blues
Lord I'm suffrin' with the honky tonk bluesEmbed
