You Are My Flower LyricsYou are my flower
That's blooming in the mountain so high
You are my flower
That's blooming there for me
When summertime is gone and snow begins to fall
You can sing this song and say to one and all
So wear a happy smile and life will be worthwhile
Forget the tears but don't forget to smileEmbed
