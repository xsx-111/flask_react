Tennessee Stud LyricsAlong about eighteen twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
And I never would have gotten through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a-ridin' that Tennessee stud
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
And one of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud
Then I rode away on the Tennessee stud
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
A-he had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
We drifted on down into no man's land
We crossed that river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foal
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns and he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee stud
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
A-he had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
Well, I got just as lonesome as a man can be
A-dreaming of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue
'Cause he was a-dreamin' of his sweetheart, too
We loped right back across Arkansas
I whooped her brother and I whooped her pa
When I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was a-ridin' that Tennessee mare (whoa, boy)
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
A-he had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
Stirrup to stirrup and side by side
We crossed them mountains and the valleys wide
We came to Big Muddy then we forded a flood
On the Tennessee mare and the Tennessee stud
There's a pretty little baby on the cabin floor
A little horse colt playin' 'round the door
I love that girl with golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare (They'se good horses)
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
And he had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee studEmbed
