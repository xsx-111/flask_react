Orange Blossom Special LyricsWell look a-yonder comin'
Comin' on down the track
Well look a-yonder comin'
Comin' on down the track
It's the Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back
Well talk about her ramblin'
She's the fastest train on the line
Well talk about her travellin'
She's the fastest train on the line
She's the Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard line
Well, I'm going down to Florida
Get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe California
Get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride the Orange Blossom Special
And lose those New York bluesEmbed
