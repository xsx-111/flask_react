Why Walk a Dog? Lyrics
Why does a dog need to be walked?
Three birds fighting out in the yard
But I don’t know what they’re fighting about
So why does a dog need to listen
Whenever you shout?
These cats seem to blow
Everyone’s mind, but mine
What is so funny
About beasts above understanding?


Are you their master?
Did you buy them at the store?
Did they know they were a cure
For you to stop being bored?
So somebody mated them
And took their babies away from them
Stuck a price tag on their nose
And now you’re buying it clothes

So, why does a dog need to be walked?11Embed
