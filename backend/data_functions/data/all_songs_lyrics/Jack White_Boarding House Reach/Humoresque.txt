Humoresque Lyrics
Strains of humoresque divine
You thrill and fill this heart of mine
With gladness like a soothing symphony
Over the air, you gently float
Into my soul, you strike a note
Of passion with your melody

Sunbeams are playing
Flowers and trees are swaying
Captured within your magic spell
If the children are dancing
Lovers are all romancing
Is it any wonder, everyone is singing?

Strains of humoresque divine
You thrill and fill this heart of mine
With gladness like a soothing symphony
Over the air, you gently float
Into my soul, you strike a note
Of passion with your melody15Embed
