Corporation Lyrics
Who's with me?
Who's with me?
Who's with me?

Yeah, I'm thinking about starting a corporation
Who's with me?
Nowadays, that's how you get adulation
Who wants to start a corporation?
I'm thinking about taking it all the way to the top
Who's with me? (Woo!)
Yeah, I'm thinking about doing one giant drop
Who's with me?
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Wooo!)


Yes, I'm thinking about buying all the empty cots
And making one giant army
Who's with me?
I'm gonna buy up all the empty lots and make one giant farm
Who's with me? (Woo!)
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about? (Wooo!)
Who's with me? (Woo! Woo!)
Yeah, I'm thinking about starting a corporation
Who's with me?
And take it right to the top
Take it right to the top!11Embed
