Get in the Mind Shaft Lyrics
When I was young
I went into an abandoned house
In one of the rooms
I found an old piano
I didn't know how to play piano
So I just fumbled across the keys
Pressed the pedals down
I sat there for hours
Trying to understand how to
Construct a melody
My brain to my finger tips
And after a while
I hit three notes together
At the same time

It’s Sunday Morning
And I have that same feeling I’ve had every Sunday
For my entire life
It’s as if I have been woken up by whispers
The whispering of voices, all around me
I can’t make out what they are saying
Some people would call it ghosts
Or some kind of hallucination
I don’t know what I’m supposed to call it
But I’ve never told anybody about that
We were 30 men
All trapped inside
The sun ended blocked out
The shaft collapsed, so
There was no way out
The gas in our lamps
Had almost run dry
It was so quiet
'Cause no one
Dared disturb the silence
By murmuring something that wasn't useful
And that's when we saw
A hand break through
And we saw the sunlight
For the first time

Wherever you go in the world
You’ll find that in the bible it says
Someone who works with their hands
A carpenter, a pot maker, a brick layer
Someone who works with their hands
It’s seems no matter how far
The human race progresses
How computerized, robotic, digital
Everything becomes around us
Not too far away, there is somebody
Working with their hands
I've been walking down by the river
For hours
Past sailors, that have
Less tattoos than the average teenager
There's a man fishing
And selling what he catches
A dollar a head
I've been sitting near him
For a long time now
And he's yet to look over
I have a strange feeling
That I know this man
That it's me
I think it's me

It’s 97 degrees out
The humidity is so thick
It’s like drinking a glass of water
Every time I take a breath
I’m standing on this mound of dirt
Cracking the bones in my fingers one by one
I’m staring at him
Wondering what he’s thinking
Is this the end or the beginning?
Will I be able to make it out alive?
And then
I slowly release the ball from my hand
And it travels toward him
Feeling distorted
Brick by brick by brick
A box containing another box
Upheaval in a pond
As large as the world
And a leaf that falls for infinity
It never lands
Across the country
Stones, soil, trees
All humming the exact same frequency
The exact same frequency

Theres a distant hum
Coming from the clouds
Just on the other side of the ridge
Nobody knows the source of the hum
And the frequency is
Is enough to rattle
Anything stationary
Entire town
Feels like it has been cursed
The hum won't go away
The oldest people around
Remember the hum
From their childhoods
And they say it's always been here
And will never go away

Sound by sound
Track by track
Note after note
Constructed melody
Soft voices, clouds compile hammering
Over, atop, and subtle and inferior
These sublime notes
The harmonies that are dissonant in the earth
Dissonant vibrations of all terms
And preposterous instrumentation
Each one adding
Extra note or frequencies
To the overall beauty
Of the melody around you

Let's try it
Let's try it

Can you hear me now?
Am I invisible to you?
Out of the blue now
Out of the blue now
Can you hear me now?
Am I invisible to you?
Get in the mind shaft

Can it be? Can it be?
Can it be? Can it be?
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Can you hear me now?
Get in the mind shaft
Get in the mind shaft
Am I invisible to you?
Come inside
Come inside
Can you hear me now?
Deep inside me, now

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Get in the mind shaft
Can you hear me now?11Embed
