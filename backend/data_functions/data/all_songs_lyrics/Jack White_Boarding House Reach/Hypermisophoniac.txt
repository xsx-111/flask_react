Hypermisophoniac Lyrics
Every sound I hear
Is louder than the last
Sounds like a dynamite blast
When you click your teeth
I need relief

Each one, each one
Louder than the last and
Makes my fingers curl
Sounds like a dynamite blast

Ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin'
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank
Ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin'
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank

Ain't nowhere to run
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank
You sip your drink
And I start to think
That I'm the only one
That can hear all the sounds in the world

Nowhere to run
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank
Ain't nowhere, ain't nowhere
Nowhere to run
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank
Ain't nowhere, ain't nowhere
Nowhere to run
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank

Nowhere to run
When you're robbing a bank13Embed
