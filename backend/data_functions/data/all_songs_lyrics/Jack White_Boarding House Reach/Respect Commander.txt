Respect Commander LyricsPt. I
All right, let's go back to our song

Pt. II
She commands my respect
She commands my respect
And I can't recollect
A better time in my life
She has all my respect
She has all my respect
And I cannot protect
My heart from her command
If she's stringin' me along
The bells are ringing strong
So I can't detect it
She's comin' up behind me
In the mornin' lovin'
When I least suspect it
Every single thing about the situation
Says I can't be wrong
And every time she gets the satisfaction
I want her to control me all night long
