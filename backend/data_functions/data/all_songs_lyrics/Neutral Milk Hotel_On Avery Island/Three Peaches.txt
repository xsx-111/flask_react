Three Peaches Lyrics
There is no dream
So wake up run your lips across your fingers till you find
Some scent of yourself that you can hold up high
To remind yourself that you didn't die
On a day that was so crappy whole and happy you're alive

And you seem so bruised and it's beautiful
As it's reflecting off from you as it shines
You're in the bathroom carving holiday designs into yourself
Hoping no one will find you but they found you
And they took you and you somehow survived

There is no dream
So wake up and if the holidays don't hollow out your eyes
Then press yourself against whatever
You find to be beautiful and trembling with life
Because I'm so happy I'm so happy I'm so happy
I'm so happy that you didn't die3Embed
