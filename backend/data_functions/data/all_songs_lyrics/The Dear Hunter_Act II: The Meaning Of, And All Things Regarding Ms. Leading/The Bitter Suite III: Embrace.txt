The Bitter Suite III: Embrace Lyrics
Darkness, hesitation
I fell into her arms
Breathe in, this is amazing
Breathe out, this is amazing
She removed her clothes, and all of the world shined
Now that we're alone, all of the world shines

First hot breath, then cold hands
Intrusion, but aware
The fire inside was all light, and she bloomed
And I never knew life could ever be this good
The distant sighs, the clothes on the floor
The bedding a mess, she sings for more

We fall beneath the sea in the back of our hearts
And fail to breathe until we resurface again

She had the summer's smile with winter's skin
And all along, with words beyond me, she welcomed me in

We fall beneath the sea in the back of our hearts
And fail to breathe until we resurface
We fall beneath the sea in the back of our hearts
And fail to breathe until we resurface againEmbed
