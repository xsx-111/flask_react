The Bitter Suite I & II: Meeting Ms. Leading/Through The Dime Lyrics

She had the summer's smile with winter's skin; she moved
A silhouette to serenade the soul
She spoke with words beyond me and slowly I pulled away
To receive a gesture implying an answer I didn't have
So I then smiled, responding, alarming
"Yes"

Her hands were the first that I'd ever felt; she breathed
Her lips hid her tongue from the world; she danced
To the doors, endearing, she carried me
"What's your name?"; conceding, "Ms. Leading"
She kindly suggests to her room
To rest my head, so I responded, unalarming

Where's her heart, where's her heart?
Mimicking the matriarch
He's naive; blissfully
Ignorant and trusting but

Where's her heart, where's her heart?
Mimicking the matriarch
He's naive; blissfully
Ignorant and trusting but now

Gentlemen: Presenting the very lovely ladies of the Dime

(Step right in!) Let her hips guide your desire
(Hey, kid, get a job, hey hey hey hey, kid, get a job)
(They have ways!) To satisfy, to satisfy what you require
(Touch, taste, feel, two times, the Dime)

But the perks are more than price
And the guarantee is clean
("They're all clean!")
(We know what the men all want)
And they know it isn't free

Her history is left behind
The ignorance has room to breathe
They play a part and act a scene
The prejudice, the guilty

(Take a chair!) You're not alone, the bed's your home tonight
(Hey, kid, hey kid get a job, hey hey hey hey, kid, get a job)
(Wait right there!) We'll magnify and maximize your inner fire
(Touch, taste, feel, two times, the Dime)
'Cause if you boys are nice
The ladies here are clean
("They're all clean!")
(We know what the men all want)
And they know it isn't free

Her history is left behind
The ignorance has room to breathe
They play a part and act a scene
The prejudice, the guiltyEmbed
