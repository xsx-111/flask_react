The Oracles on the Delphi Express Lyrics
Stick with us, throw your morals out the door
You aren't in the land of the river and the lake no more
Makeshift schemes, we've got plenty here for you
Lock away your dreams and throw away the key

You've been stuck in the middle of patience and animosity
With a lust for solidity, and a cryptic history, your luck's running thin

Crimson hands brandish wounds which masquerade
If you flee from grace, your souls cannot be saved
Big steam ships, exits illustrate the flaw
Don't be ashamed of your amour faux pas
When the bombs go off you'll know right where you are

You've been stuck in the middle of patience and animosity
With a lust for solidity, and a cryptic history, your luck's running thin

You've been stuck in the middle of patience and animosity
With a lust for solidity, and a cryptic history, your luck's running thinEmbed
