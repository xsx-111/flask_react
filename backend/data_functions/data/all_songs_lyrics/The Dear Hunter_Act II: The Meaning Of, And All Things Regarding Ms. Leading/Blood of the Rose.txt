Blood of the Rose Lyrics
Dance, dance your decay
All the while unknowing that you're led astray
Sleep, sleep through your woe
While your voice slowly withers and melts away

Sing, sing unto me
The pleasure and the pain
Reveal to me
The reasons my love's not in vain

Sangre, sangre de la rosa
Sigue en paz sin el pasado
Recé, recé por su alma
Ella morirá en el battesimo del fuego

Sing, sing unto me
The pleasure and the pain
Reveal to me
The reasons my love's not in vain

The world burns, but still we breathe
The iron chambered heart a sieve
That sifts through honest elegance
And suffers from the wrong defense
The world burns, but still we breathe
The iron chambered heart a sieve
That sifts through honest elegance
And suffers from the wrong defenseEmbed
