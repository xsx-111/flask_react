Vital Vessels Vindicate Lyrics
Salt in the sky in the sweet summer air while mammoths depart
Abandon dispair with thirsty affairs of the heart
But the chances of escaping my heart are inadaquate
And when all is said and done, I'm left with my history

Goodbye, my eyes shed heavy tears
One for every soul still sitting on the fence between pain and arrogance

Ebb to the left flow to the right the exit's unflawed
The boys on the train, the almighty tongue with prose spilled in vain

Goodbye, my eyes shed heavy tears
One for every soul still sitting on the fence between pain and arrogance

We fall beneath the sea of dreams
And fail to breathe, until we resurface
We fall beneath the sea of dreams
And fail to breathe, until we awaken again

Sing softly, sing me to the lake, sing softly, bring me to the lake
(The flame is gone, the fire remains)
Sing softly, sing me to the lake, sing softly, bring me to the lake
(The flame is gone, the fire remains)
Sing softly, sing me to the lake, sing softly, bring me to the lake, sing
(The flame is gone, the fire remains)
Through all of this I've felt just the same
The flame is gone, the fire remains
