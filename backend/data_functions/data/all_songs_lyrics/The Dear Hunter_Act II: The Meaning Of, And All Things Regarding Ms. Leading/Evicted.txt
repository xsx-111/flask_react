Evicted Lyrics
I have been evicted
From a soul constricted
By the flameless fire
Can we all just go cold?

If you need a little cash you sell yourself
To everything
A dollar in exchange for failing hearts
So loudly say

Oh, how I surely know that frame of mind
Sleeping softly curbside
Comfortably abroad on a stolen ticket
None of this will last, all of this will pass
When bed sheets are broken glass
I know your hearts will skip a beat in empathy

If you need a little cash you sell yourself
To everything
A dollar in exchange for failing hearts
So loudly say
Oh, how I surely know that frame of mind
Sleeping softly curbside
Comfortably abroad on a stolen ticket
None of this will last, all of this will pass
When bed sheets are broken glass
I know your hearts will skip a beat in empathy

It's just that easy, pick yourself up
And go give the world a great big smile
(Hey, hey, kid, hey, kid, get a job
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, kid, get a job)
Wash your mouth out, ditch those morals
Sleep your way right to, right to the top
(Hey, hey, kid, hey, kid get a job
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, kid, get a job)Embed
