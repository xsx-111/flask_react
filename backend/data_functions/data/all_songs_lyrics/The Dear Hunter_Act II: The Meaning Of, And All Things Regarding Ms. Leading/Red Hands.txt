Red Hands Lyrics
Even if you never strayed from me
I'd question your fidelity
There'd always be a shroud of suspicion
And my heart's a liability
With your hands marooned so freshly red
You'd wrap your lips around my neck
Try and forced to love the thought of me
Simple motions make me ill

Was it bitter when you tossed and turned on his under cover mattress?
Did it feel so good? Hope it felt so good
Don't know what I'd do if you lost sleep over little old me
He's so much better, they're all much better
Take off your sweater, your shoes, and your shirt, and get to work

Maybe this is just a work of art
Scripted players in a play of lust
Hope the end is well worth waiting for
Everything you wished it be

Was it bitter when you tossed and turned on his under cover mattress?
Did it feel so good? Hope it felt so good
Don't know what I'd do if you lost sleep over little old me
He's so much better, they're all much better
Take off your sweater, your shoes, and your shirt and get to work
Oh my god, what have I done?
Now, my darling, put your clothes back on
Oh my god, what have I done?
Now, my darling, put your clothes back on
Because you can't be caught red handed if you're not red handed
My darling, I would never say those words to you
I was pulling out my heart so I could pin it to my sleeve
On display for you to see I'm on display
Because you can't be caught red handed if you're not red handed
My darling, I would never say those words to you
I was pulling out my heart so I could pin it to my sleeve
On display for you to see I'm on display
(Oh my god, what have I done?
Now, my darling, put your clothes back on
Oh my god, what have I done?
Now, my darling, put your clothes back on
Now, my darling, put your clothes back on)

Because you can't be caught red handed if you're not red handed (Oh my god, what have I done?)
My darling, I would never say those words to you (Now, my darling, put your clothes back on)
I was pulling out my heart so I could pin it to my sleeve (Oh my god, what have I done?)
On display for you to see I'm on display (Now, my darling, put your clothes back on)
(Now, my darling, put your clothes back on)
(Oh my god what have I done?
Now, my darling, put your clothes back on
Now, my darling, put your clothes back on)4Embed
