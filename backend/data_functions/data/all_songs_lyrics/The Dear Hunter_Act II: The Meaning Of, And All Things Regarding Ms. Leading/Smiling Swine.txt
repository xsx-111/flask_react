Smiling Swine Lyrics
I woke alone, put on my coat, ran for the door
Down the stairs, and made it to the second floor
Stopped by the squeaky wheel, a smiling swine
Stunned by the sight and fearing what's behind

"Hey there," he pleasantly began
"Good day," he telescoped his hand
"Is there a service I can possibly propose?
Ms. Leading seems to me to be a proper butterfly"
"Then I suggest you pack your bags and learn to drive"

Tucked in my shirt, and finally made my way outside
He broke the scene, a Machiavellian dandelion
Blissfully plucked from the bloom of another

But all the while
She was still fresh in my mind
And though this might be premature
But ambition strikes just when the mood is right
The mood is right
Now all the while, now all the while
She is still fresh in my mind, she's fresh in my mind
And though it might sound premature
But ambition strikes just when the mood is right
The mood is right
Oh
Now all the while, now all the while
She is still stuck in my mind, she's stuck in my mind
And though it might sound premature, oh
But ambition strikes me when the mood is right, the mood is right
And the mood is right, the mood is right
Oh
Now all the while, now all the while
She is still stuck in my mind, she's stuck in my mind
And though it might sound premature
But ambition strikes me when the mood is right, the mood is right
And the mood is right, oh
Now all the while, now all the while
She is still stuck in my mind, still stuck in my mind
And though it might sound premature, oh
But ambition strikes me when the mood is right, when the mood is right
And the mood is right, and the mood is right
Now all the while, now all the while
She is still stuck in my mind, she's stuck in my mind
And though it might sound premature, oh
But ambition strikes me when the mood is right, when the mood is right
And the mood is right

One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, fourEmbed
