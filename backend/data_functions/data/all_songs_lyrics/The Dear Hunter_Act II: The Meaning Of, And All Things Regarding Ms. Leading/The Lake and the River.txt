The Lake and the River Lyrics
Everything you'd live and die for
Reasons leading you through here
Perished matriarchal bonds, failing innocence of love
When the world beckons your approach, it swallows you whole

You'll believe what you're meant to believe
In the hands of ghosts, we're never responsible
Wait to see what you're meant to see
The veil lifts when you expose your soul

Prayed I would leave this place someday
Joined to alarm from long ago, now unconcerned
Euphorically floating upon wax wings, where is the sun?
I still see her face; her beauty, her grace
Transfixed like a light in front of me
It follows my soul, and swallows me whole

You'll believe what you're led to believe
In the hands of ghosts, we're never responsible
Wait to see what you're meant to see
The veil lifts when you expose your soul
Left, right, left, right
Left, right, left, right
Left, right, left, right

His branches reached so far before
His leaves were bold extremities with great control
Wasted along; he died alone

You'll believe what you're meant to believe
In the hands of ghosts, we're never responsible
Wait to see what you're meant to see
The veil lifts when you expose your soul

She's inanimate, bloodless elegance
Fatal fascination breeds a bloom of misery
Helpless hiding tongues, bathed in revulsion
Here lies possibility, wilting premature

But the right hand hates the left
And the sea's upset with the sky
So we press on, press on, press on, press on
In spite of the spite
Happiness is a knife
When the world rolls on its side
And your mind's on fire
Don't you know that happiness is a knife
When the world rolls on fire?

Trying to find the trouble with the trouble I've found
Begging my god to make the wheels go 'round
Eat so much but I never get full
Earth opened up and swallowed us whole
Trying to find the trouble with the trouble I've found
Begging my god to make the wheels go 'round
Eat so much but I never get full
Earth opened up and swallowed us wholeEmbed
