Get Out Of My Way Lyrics
Crash bang wallop I'm a lover again
I've got my eyes on the road and I'm feeling no pain
I've found a real fine woman, I'm heading to see her
Bye bye melancholy listen to me
We had a long long ride but it isn't to be
I've got a real fine woman, I'm heading to see her now

Get out of my way
Get out of my life
I don't need anybody to tell me
How to be right
Now don't try to stop me
I've got the answer
I won't need anybody except my woman tonight
Yeah yeah


I can't help it if I'm starting to smile
I've got a full gas tank and it's only a mile
Till I'll be with my little woman, I'm ready to see her
So I say bye bye melancholy listen to me
We had a long long ride but it isn't to be
I've got a real fine woman, I'm heading to see her now
Get out of my way
Get out of my life
I don't need anybody to tell me
How to be right
Don't try to stop me
I've got the answer
I won't need anybody except my woman tonight

Yeah, get out of my way
Baby, get out of my life
I won't need anybody except my woman tonight
Tonight
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah
AlrightEmbed
