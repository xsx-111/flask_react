Winedark Open Sea Lyrics
Open up your heart
If you want to set me free
Full of love, your love
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea

Lighten up, my heart
Leave it to the evening breeze
Give me love, your love
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea

Oh my, I feel love for you
Spreading through my body
I remember how
We can be so loving
I feel love for you now
I feel love for you right now

Loosen up, my heart
Let me have some time to be
With a love, oh my love
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Oh my, I feel love for you
Spreading through my body
I remember how
We can be so loving
I feel love for you now
I feel love for you right now

We're sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea

Oh, I feel love for you now
I feel love for you right now
I feel love for you now
Baby I feel love for you right now
We're sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Finish it now1Embed
