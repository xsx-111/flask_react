Mistress And Maid Lyrics
She said, "Come in my dear
You're looking tired tonight
Your bath is drawn, let me loosen your tie
And fix you your usual drink"

He settles back, takes a magazine
Kicks off his shoes, as he studies the form
Of every appealing soubrette

But where are the flowers that he used to bring?
Every endearing remark
Reminds her of passionate promises
That he only made in the dark
In her bed

She wants to shout at the back of his head
Look at me, look at me, look at me--I'm afraid
See what it's come to
I'm just your mistress and maid

The wine is warm, but the dinner is cold
The look in his eye tells her it won't be long
Till the girls on the page come to life
They'll get the flowers that he used to bring
With every endearing remark
And all of the passionate promises
He'll never fulfill in the dark
In their bed

She wants to shout at the back of his head
Look at me, look at me, now that I'm not afraid
See what it's come to
I'm not your mistress and maid

See what it's come to
I'm not your mistress and maid
No no no no
No no no no
Mistress and maid
Mistress and maid
Mistress and maid
Mistress and maidEmbed
