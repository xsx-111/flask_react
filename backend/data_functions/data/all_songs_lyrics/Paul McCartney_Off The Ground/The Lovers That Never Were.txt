The Lovers That Never Were Lyrics
I have always needed somebody girl
But I close the doors to keep out the world
But for you, I would be here all alone
Locked in a photograph

All of the clocks have run down
Lover beware
We'll be the lovers that never were

I hang patiently on every word you send
Will we ever be much more than just friends?
As for you, you sit there playing this game
You keep me waiting

When all of the clocks have run down
All over the world
We'll be the lovers that never were

For as long as the sun shines in somebody's eyes
I believe in you baby, so don't tell me lies
For as long as the trees throw down blossoms and leaves
I know there will be a parade of unpainted dreams
And I know dear, how much it's going to hurt
If you still refuse to get your hands dirty
So you, you must tell me something... I love you
Say goodbye or anything

All of the clocks have run down
Time's at an end
If we can't be lovers we'll never be friends

For as long as the sun shines in somebody's eyes
I believe in you baby, so don't tell me lies
For as long as the trees throw down blossoms and leaves
I know there will be a parade of unpainted dreamsEmbed
