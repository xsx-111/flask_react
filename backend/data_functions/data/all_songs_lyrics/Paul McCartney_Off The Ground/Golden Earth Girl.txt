Golden Earth Girl Lyrics
Golden earth girl, female animal
Sings to the wind, resting at sunset
In a mossy nest
Sensing moonlight in the air
Moonlight in the air

Good clear water friend of wilderness
Sees in the pool her own reflection
In another world
Someone over there is counting

Fish in a sunbeam
In eggshell seas
Fish in a sunbeam
Eggshell finish

Natures lover climbs the primrose hill
Smiles at the sky watching the sunset
From a mossy nest
As she falls asleep she's counting

Fish in a sunbeam
In eggshell seas
Fish in a sunbeam
Eggshell finish
As she falls asleep she's counting

Fish in a sunbeam
In eggshell seas
Fish in a sunbeam
Eggshell finishEmbed
