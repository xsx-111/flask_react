Peace in the Neighbourhood Lyrics
Best thing I ever saw
Was a man who loved his wife
In a place where things were good
I felt peace in the neighbourhood

That feeling in the air
Something was definitely there
It was a time when things were good
I felt peace in the neighbourhood

I was there, I really was
At the centre of a love vibration
People sharing with their friends
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out

Then I woke up from my dream
To see things as they really are
People struggling to survive
How can peace hope to stay alive?
Well I was there, I felt so good
At the centre of a love vibration
People caring for their world
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out

Best thing I ever saw
I saw a man who loved his wife
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Peace in the neighbourhood
Peace in the neighbourhoodEmbed
