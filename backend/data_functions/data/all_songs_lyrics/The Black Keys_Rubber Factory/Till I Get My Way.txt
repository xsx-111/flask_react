Till I Get My Way Lyrics
Love me don't leave me
Make me feel you need me
You kill me, thrill me
Don't you know that I will be
Calling on you everyday
Till I get my way

Darling, I wonder
How you pulled me under
You kill me, thrill me
Don't you know that I will be
Calling on you everyday
Till I get my way
Till I get my way
Hey


Darling, remember
The cold, cold nights in December
You kill me, thrill me
Don't you know that I will be
Calling on you everyday
Till I get my way
Till I get my way
Till I get my way
Till I get my wayEmbed
