The Lengths LyricsTell me where you're going
What is goin' wrong
I felt you leaving
Before you'd even gone
Hold me now or never, ever
Hold me again
No more talk could take me from this
Pain I'm in
Pain I'm in

See the moonlight shining
On your window pane
See it leave you
As faithful as it came
Please yourself
So you don't have to be afraid
Make amends
Or carry on another way
Another way

Tell me what you were thinking
To treat somebody so
The care he took
The lengths to which he'd go
The coals are hot
To walk across without your shoes
But in the end
Know that you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose3Embed
