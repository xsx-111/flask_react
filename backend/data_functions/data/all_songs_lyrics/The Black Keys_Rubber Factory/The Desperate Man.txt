The Desperate Man Lyrics
Alright
See her walking
With a fella
Two of them
So nice and mella
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
My heart is broken
It's open wide
Feel so down
Deep inside
Hey-hey, hey-hey hey-hey-hey, alright
Hit it

Summer's here but I'm still in fall
Wondering what she done me for
Hey-hey, hey-hey hey-hey-hey, alright
I'm too far down the deepest ditch
Too far gone to ever switch
Hey-hey, hey-hey hey-hey-hey, hit it
Alright, yeah, alright, yeah, yeah, alright

Hit it, alright, alright
Drive all night now
Without a care
Hope to catch you
Standing there
Hey-hey, hey-hey hey-hey-hey
Don't forsake a desperate man
Hope you know that's who I am
Hey hey, hey-hey hey-hey-hey
Alright, yeah, hit it, alright, yeah
Ahh, ahh
