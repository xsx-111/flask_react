Girl Is On My Mind Lyrics
Girl is on my mind
Girl is on my mind
Try to ignore it
I try to unwind
But she is on my mind

Eyes are in my eyes
Eyes are in my eyes
Where I've been
How time flies
When she is in my eyes

See her standing there
See her standing there
She's gentle now and she
Takes great care
See her standing there

Hold me close to you
Hold me close to you
Not one thing that I
Would not do if you
Would hold me close to you, alright
Yeah!

Girl is on my mind
She is on my mind
Try to ignore it
Try to unwind
But she is on my mind
Ooh-ooh~ooh
Ooh~yeah
Ooh~ooh~ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh~ooh~oh~yeah~oohEmbed
