Aeroplane Blues Lyrics
I'm on an airplane
'Cross the sea
Going nowhere
I wanna be

Distant land
Don't know who I am

Eyes are heavy
Mind is shook
Can't feel
Drugs I took

Distant land
Don't know who I am

Take your seat
Don't be shy
You've got to remember, yeah
That you were born to die
Distant land
Don't know who I am
Don't know who I am
Don't know who I am1Embed
