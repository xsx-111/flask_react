Hag LyricsGiving back your stony silence
Dig a deep hole, your gain my loss
Rid you of all the love in you
Hiding feelings under hard shell
A corner of the churchyard
You twisted up my future my useless dog
Incarcerate in dread now
Separate the heart and you lose me you hag
Leave you hanging, falling, failing
Giving back your stony silenceEmbed
