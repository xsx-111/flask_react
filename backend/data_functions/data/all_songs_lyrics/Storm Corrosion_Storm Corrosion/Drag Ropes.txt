Drag Ropes Lyrics
Now my dear friend
Now for your sin
You're to suffer
Here it begins

Drag ropes forward
Shame will save you
Out moves inward
Turn of the screw

Gallows free you
Dawn's relief
Hood to blind you
Be at peace

I was mortal but I am your
Friend to stay and
Be (be) beside you
Always (here) here and
(I'm human too)
Always with you now
Lies are manifold and the truth is told x4
(are manifold and the truth can now be told)
