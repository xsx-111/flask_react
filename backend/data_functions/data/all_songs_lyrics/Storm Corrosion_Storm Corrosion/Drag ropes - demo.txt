Drag ropes - demo LyricsNow my dear friend
Now for your sins
You're to suffer
Here it begins
Drag ropes forthward
Shame will save you
Out moves inward
Turn of the screw
Gallows free you
Dawn's release
Hood to blind you
Be at peace
I was mortal but I am your friend
To stay and fear beside you
Always here (I know)
I"m always with you now
And the truth can now be told on manifold 
Now my dear friend
Now for your sins
You"re to suffer
Here it begins
I was mortal but I am your friend
To stay and fear beside you
Always here (I pray for you)
I"m always with you nowEmbed
