Ljudet Innan LyricsSee you were crying
See you were crying
Mine is what you are
Mine is what you are
Mine - you are mine
And I see you wait, see you wait
In the sky
I purge you now
'Cause I got hope inside me
Come back to me now
It's after hours
'Cause I'm nowhere now
Without you here
Cold wind will come
I purge you1Embed
