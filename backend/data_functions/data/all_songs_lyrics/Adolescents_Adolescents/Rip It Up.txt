Rip It Up LyricsIt's like Clockwork Orange a bit of twenty on one
Breaking heads well that don't sound like much fun
Is that your only way of getting kicks
By breaking heads you can't fix
Do you think you're tough
Because you rip it up
Gotta rip you up
Do yo gotta rip it up
Gotta rip it up
Gotta rip it up
I've had enough of violence
Just to kill boredom makes no sense
We're not the background for your stupid fights
Get out of the darkness it's time to unite
Do you think you're tough
Because you rip it up
Gotta rip it up
Gotta rip it up
Gotta rip it up
Gotta rip it up
Gotta rip it upEmbed
