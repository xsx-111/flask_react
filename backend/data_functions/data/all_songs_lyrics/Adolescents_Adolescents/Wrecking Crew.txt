Wrecking Crew LyricsThere's nothing to do
Excitement level zero
I can't find a girl
Cos they're all out chasing heros
We're just a wrecking crew bored boys with nothing to do
Alone in a corner of a room with a knife
Better ways out than taking your life
Home's not so bad don't need to run
Come join our primitive ways of fun
We're just a wrecking crew bored guys with nothing to do
Safety in numbers an enemy to beat
Let's overturn cars and rip up the street
I'm tired of being a peaceful citizen
Noise and destruction are in my vision
We're just a wrecking crew bored boys with nothing to do
You're not all by yourself
You've got a few friends
When we become one
The violence never ends
We're just a wrecking crew bored boys with nothing to doEmbed
