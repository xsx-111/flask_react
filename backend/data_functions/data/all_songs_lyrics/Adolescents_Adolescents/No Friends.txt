No Friends LyricsSo your hair's bleached white now
It's in to put Orange County down
Hanging out with L.A. sleaze well
Go ahead and push us we don't want you around
Sang for the Slashers you told Hermosa Beach
So you used to be a surfer in Huntington Beach
You're a liar if you follow all trends
Get out of here asshole, you've got no friends
Just cling to the scene
But not when everybody knows what you are
Where are you gonna go next?
I hear San Francisco's second best
You got no friends...
Do you think you're real tough with those locks and chains?
You know we want to use them to beat on your brains
Show up in Fullerton with blue dye on your head
You stupid fucker, I wish you were dead
Sang for the Slashers you told Hermosa Beach
So you used to be a surfer in Huntington Beach
You're a liar if you follow a trend
Get out of here asshole, you've got no friends
Just cling to the scene
But not when everybody knows what you are
Where are you gonna go next?
I hear San Francisco's second best
You got no friends!Embed
