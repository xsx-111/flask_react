L. A. Girl LyricsWe don't really care if you say we're too young
We don't waste our time tanning in the sun
We don't even care what you now or think
Spoiled rich brat you ain't so neat

L.A. girl, L.A. world
Don't tell us how to act
Don't tell us what to wear
L.A. girl, L.A. world
You didn't create our scene
We don't care
We can't see why
We dont live our lives
To keep you satisfied
Stuck in your world of dreams again
My life starts where your life ends
You've burned out your battery has died
If it wasn't for O.C. your scene wouldn't be alive
L.A. girl, L.A. world
Don't tell us how to act
Don't tell us what to wear
L.A. girl, L.A. world
You didn't create our scene
We don't really care if you say we're too young
We don't waste our time tanning in the sun
We don't even care what you now or think
Spoiled rich brat you ain't so neat
L.A. girl, L.A. world
Don't tell us how to act
Don't tell us what to wear
L.A. girl, L.A. world
You didn't create our scene

I'm bored of the sleasy make-up
You'd fuck any guy in town
Your life's a total mess-up
Why the hell do you hang around
L.A. girl you bring me down
L.A. girl, L.A. world
Don't tell us how to act
Don't tell us what to wear
L.A. girl, L.A. worldEmbed
