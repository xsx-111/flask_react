Word Attack LyricsI'm not paranoid - don't/they
No I'm not afraid - stop/won't
But I sometimes wonder - fight/win
What is on your mind - back
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head
The gun in your hand is gonna kill me dead
We'll attack, we'll attack
We'll attack, we'll attack
We'll attack, we'll attack
We'll attack, we'll attack
Got me running into walls - don't/they
Say good things - stop/won't
Say bad things - fight/win
Because you're unpredictable - back
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head
The gun in your hand is gonna kill me dead
We'll attack, we'll attack
We'll attack, we'll attack
We'll attack, we'll attack
We'll attack, we'll attack
Do you wanna die - no
Do you wanna die - no
Do you wanna die - no
I don't wanna die
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head
The gun in your hand is gonna kill me dead
We'll attack, we'll attack
We'll attack, we'll attack
We'll attack, we'll attack
We'll attack, we'll attackEmbed
