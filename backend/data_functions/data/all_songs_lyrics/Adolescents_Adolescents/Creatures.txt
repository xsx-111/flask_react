Creatures LyricsI'm not accepted by my peers - so what
I could care less about the queers - they're fucked
The chicks are hot and full of cheers - pleasers
They say "no" so I jerk white tears - teasers
I hate them all - creatures
I hate all them - creatures
I hate them all - creatures
I do not act or dress the same - hopeless
I do not fit inside their frame - or class
Oh can't they see that they are lame - no heads
That they're just tokens of my game - pieces
I hate them all - creatures
I hate all them - creatures
I hate them all - creatures
I'm not accepted by my peers - so what
I could care less about the queers - they're fucked
The chicks are hot and full of cheers - pleasers
They say "no" so I jerk white tears - teasers
I hate them all - creatures
I hate all them - creatures
I hate them all - creatures
I hate them all - creatures
I hate them all - creatures
I hate them all - creatures
I hate them all1Embed
