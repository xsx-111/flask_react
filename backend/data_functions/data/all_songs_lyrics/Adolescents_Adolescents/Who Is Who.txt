Who Is Who LyricsMy friends call me enemy cos they're a fucking joke
They'd better get their act together it's time that they awoke
I'm cast out by my relatives cos they don't want me around
I just sit in a corner and I don't make a sound
Not one word
The walls are closing in on me
I don't know what to do
Please tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Policemen are my friends so why do they always stare
Raid our clubs bust out parties condemned for short hair
Teachers are my friends so why do they make me stand
In front of a class of gawking fools who'll never understand
They'll never understand
The world around me falls apart
I don't know what to do
Please tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Tell me who is whoEmbed
