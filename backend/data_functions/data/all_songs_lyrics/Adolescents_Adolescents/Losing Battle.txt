Losing Battle LyricsCan't handle this life anymore
Point in the mirror and I ask what for
Just a miserable monster or part
Dangling at ropes' end good start
Crumbling down - into a mess
I've got too many problems - that tell me I'm less
Than the good god - who watches above
Who'll damn you to hell - and then tell you to love
Now suicidal, caught in a trap
Can't get out don't want to fight back
Now the firing squad is set
To give me the bullet to help me forget
Thinking smart but I'm acting dumb
So come on tell me which side has won?
Just one message before my head explodes
You can't win the losing battle but I didn't know!
Now suicidal, caught in a trap
Can't get out don't want to fight back
Now the firing squad is set
To give me the bullet to help me forget
Crumbling down - into a mess
I've got too many problems - that tell me I'm less
Than the good god - who watches above
Who'll damn you to hell - and then tell you to loveEmbed
