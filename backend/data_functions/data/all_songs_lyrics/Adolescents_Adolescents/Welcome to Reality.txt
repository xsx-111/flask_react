Welcome to Reality Lyrics(Verse 1)
Blood so deep the horse must hold his head up high
In the valley of decision one third of the world will die
Beat your hoes and plows into axes and spears
As the armies meet in a battle they predicted for years
(Chorus)
Let the weak say I'm a warrior
Bring down the warriors
Let the faithless regain faith
Your faith is hopeless
(Verse 2)
The prophets and the psychics and the military agree
Continual crisis leads us straight to world war three
Roll the red carpet let the angel of death ride in
To the valley of decision let the mayhem begin
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
Apocalyptic madness two thirds of the world in sadness
The other third is gone but sadness lingers on
Crumbled cities and an aftermath of hate
No way to stop them 'cause now its too late
The Antichrist's mission's done
The dead are the only lucky ones
Are you ready? The picture's painted
For the valley- the scene is set
Of decision- make your decision
For the valley it's too late
Welcome welcome to reality
Welcome welcome to reality
Make a decision cause you've got no choiceEmbed
