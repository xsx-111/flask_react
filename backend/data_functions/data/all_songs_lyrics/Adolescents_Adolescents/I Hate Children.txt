I Hate Children LyricsAnother child born to the house
(I hate children)
Raise him right so he won't be a mouse
(I hate children)
I hate it when they make lots of noise
(I hate children)
And I broke my neck tripping over their toys
(I hate children)
Shut your mouth you stupid little brat
What you need's a smack smack smack
If I had my way I'd give you all away
I hate the crying that they make
(I hate children)
Screaming and whining for a piece of cake
(I hate children)
I hate getting up late at night
(I hate children)
To check and see if the crying baby's alright
(I hate children)
Shut your mouth you stupid little brat
What you need's a smack smack smack
If I had my way I'd give you all away
Now you're had you little monstrous kid
(I hate children)
It's of you that I'll be rid
(I hate children)
Do you see this toy it's called a gun
(I hate children)
And if you wanna live you'd better run
(I hate children)
Shut your mouth you stupid little brat
What you need's a smack smack smack
If I had my way I'd give you all away
I hate children
I hate children
I hate children
I hate children
Kill all children dead3Embed
