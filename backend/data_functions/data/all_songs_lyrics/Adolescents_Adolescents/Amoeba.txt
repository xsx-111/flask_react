Amoeba Lyrics
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaaaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaaaaaa

We are scientists in our lab
Looking through the microscope
The little glass slides they never lie
How can this small mind cope?

I've never seen anything like it before (Ahhh, ahhh)
This amoeba's got a mind of it's own (Ahhh)
But don't turn your back you stupid science world (Ahhh, ahhh)
This is reaching for the telephone (Ahhh)

Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaaaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaaaaaa
A one celled creature, a one celled thing
It hardly knows it's alive
You're better off dead if you only knew
Your growing life is taking a dive

I've never seen anything like it before (Ahhh, ahhh)
This amoeba's got a mind of it's own (Ahhh)
But don't turn away you stupid science world (Ahhh, ahhh)
This is reaching for the telephone (Ahhh)

Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaaaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaaaaaa

Ahhhhhhh
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaa
Amoebaaaaaaaa
Amoebaaaa (Amoeba, amoeba, amoeba, amoeba)
Amoebaaaa (Amoeba, amoeba, amoeba, amoeba)
Amoebaaaa (Amoeba, amoeba, amoeba, amoeba)
Amoebaaaaaaaa (Amoeba, amoeba, amoeba, amoeba)3Embed
