Self Destruct LyricsLooking back on stupid things I've said
Was that really me or was I misled
Not even a smile cos it's been done before
And you don't think it's funny anymore
Crying I'm sorry I'm out of my head
End up fixing junk instead
Taken too much got nothing to give
Got no reason left to live
Stupid kid you don't really know
But I'm a time bomb ready to explode
Is it really fair it's not up to you to decide
But hitting your arm is slow suicide
Crying I'm sorry I'm out of my head
End up fixing junk instead
Taken too much got nothing to give
Got no reason left to liveEmbed
