Tiger Lyrics
The city is a jungle, you'd better take care
Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe me, you'd better beware
Of me

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner, and try not to scream
It's me

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

The city is a prison, you'll never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows, and you'll see the shape
Of me

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger
And if I meet you, what if I eat you?
I am the tiger
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger, tiger, tigerEmbed
