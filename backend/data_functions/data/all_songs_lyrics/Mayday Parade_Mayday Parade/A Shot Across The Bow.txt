A Shot Across The Bow Lyrics
It's time I said this, but I'm so choked up
And I need my sanity
I'm scared, believe me
You can see me smile
If you let me just stick around
Well this is bye, bye baby
It ended like a sudden stop on a freight train
If you're not happy and you hurt this much
Then let me just stick around
But can I have one second of your time?
If I don't it'll drive me crazy
As I drop to my knees
And scream "I hate you more than you could know"

I hope you fall into the ocean
And the current leaves you helpless swimming around
As the waves crash over you until you drown and float away
And hold a funeral for nothing
And celebrate how empty love can be broken
It takes the sea to put you six feet happily underground

Now it's back to reality
I'm left in shambles but I guess that's how I should be
I knew the wedding bells were ringing loud
But my bride was missing
Oh no, it's not supposed to hurt this much
But when someone slowly breaks it off
It tends to leave a bitter taste
A scar, that slowly rips apart
Can I have one second of your time?
If I don't it'll drive me crazy
As I drop to my knees
And scream "I hate you more than you could know"
I hope you fall into the ocean
And the current leaves you helpless swimming around
As the waves crash over you until you drown and float away
And hold a funeral for nothing
And celebrate how empty love can be broken
It takes the sea to put you six feet happily underground
Underground

I've had enough but it's all for the best
I need to get a few things off my chest
There's got to be another way I can say it
But to get it right, I have to get straight
I hope he tasted like the way I used to taste
I can't believe I'd even say this to you now
When you won't listen at all

I hope you fall into the ocean
And the current leaves you helpless swimming around
As the waves crash over you, and over you until you drown
And we'll hold a funeral for nothing
Celebrate how empty love can be broken
It takes the sea to put you six feet happily underground
It takes the sea to put you six feet happily underground2Embed
