No Heroes Allowed Lyrics
Well now it's hard to see with all these flashing cameras in my face
But I love the way they play
Throwing shadows on the stage
I wonder where you are and what you think about this place
I can't help but miss the days
And I'll write on every page

My hero, she's the last real dreamer I know
And I could tell you all about her
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til I roll over
Can we just start over again
And I can tell you all about her
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til then

And now I just had this dream that we were on my bed again
Making love the way we did
Tell me how could I forget
This can't be healthy now the way I dream about your lips
But this just wasn't any kiss
I hope you're still not over this
Not at least 'til I get over you

My hero, she's the last real dreamer I know
And I could tell you all about her
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til I roll over
Can we just start over again
And I can tell you all about her
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til then
And now I get left alone while you are lost in outer space
Spreading love another way
And we'll meet again someday
I've taken all I can but I keep thinking just the same
I guess I'll die another day
But I'm sure I'll be on my way
Maybe I'll collapse and float away

Please go home
My hero, she's the last real dreamer I know
And I could tell you all about her
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til I roll over
Can we just start over again
And I can tell you all about her
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til then2Embed
