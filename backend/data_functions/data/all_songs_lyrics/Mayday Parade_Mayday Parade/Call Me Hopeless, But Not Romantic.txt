Call Me Hopeless, But Not Romantic Lyrics
I can't believe that so much time was spent on my own
Just tryin' to figure it out all alone
Don't show emotion, let this go
I can pretend that everything is still okay
Until you rightfully say what you said
The night you left me here for dead

Why do you cry when you're falling asleep?
And girl, how can you love without you ever losing it all
Don't put your faith in this, when you won't believe it
Where did you go?
How will you find yourself, when your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself, you're losing hope, losing hope?

Is it just me or has the time we spent come undone
I know forever is not what you want
I'll pack my bags and brush it off, brush it off

Why do you cry when you're falling asleep?
And girl, how can you love without ever losing it all
Don't put your faith in this, when you won't believe it
Where did you go?
How will you find yourself, when your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself, you're losing hope?
Tell me that you're alright
Yeah, like I really care
Why do we fight sometimes
Just like we always do
Try and make up your mind
I'll make it up for you
Try and make up your mind
Your, mind, your mind

Where did you go?
How will you find yourself, when your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself, you're losing hope, you're losing hope?
Where did you go?
How will you find yourself, when your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself, you're losing hope, you're losing hope?Embed
