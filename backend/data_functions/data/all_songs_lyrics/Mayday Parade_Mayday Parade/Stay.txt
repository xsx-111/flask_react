Stay Lyrics
I need some time just deliver the things that I need for now
Everything that I feel's like a warm deep calm casting over me
And it's taking me to somewhere new
If you believe that everything's alright
You won't be all alone tonight
And I'd be blessed by the light of your company
Slowly lifting me to somewhere new

Oh can you tell, I haven't slept very well
Since the last time that we spoke, you said
"Please understand if I see you again don't even say hello."
Please

What a night it is, when you live like this
And you're coming up beneath the clouds
Don't let me down
All the love's still there I just don't know what to do with it now
You know, I still can't believe we both did some things
I don't even wanna think about
Just say you love me and I'll say "I'm sorry
I don't want anybody else to feel this way"
No, no, no
Oh can you tell, I haven't slept very well
Since the last time that we spoke, I said
"Please understand I've been drinking again, and all I do is hope"
Please... stay
Please stay

I'll admit I was wrong about everything
Cause I'm high and I don't wanna come down
All the fun that we had on your mothers couch
I don't even wanna think about
I'm not strong enough for the both of us
What was I supposed to do
You know I love you
Whoa-oh

Please just stay
