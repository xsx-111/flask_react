Duel with the Devil Lyrics
Have you woke up screaming in the silence of the night?
You wish you could start dreaming in clouds of white
But everything could change tonight
When you duel with the devil living in your mind
Time reveals nothing - it's a suicide love affair
Whispers in the darkness and revolution in the air
Will you see or look behind
When you duel with the devil living in your mind
Motherless children
Wandering nowhere
Feels like there's miles to go
Reaching for water
Longing to go there
Flooding into your soul
Into your soul
Do you know the difference between who and what you are
Will you ride off in the distance like some highway star
Will you try until you make it good
Or will you sell your body down in Hollywood
Motherless children
Wandering nowhere
Looks like there's miles to go
Reaching for water
Longing to go there
Flooding into your soul
Into your soul...

There's a time to understand
There's a time to see the sun
There's a time for makin' up
There's a time to come together
Fall into the learning curve
Feeding on experience
Never turn your back on me
Never paint it black by numbers
It's so easy to waste away
It's a simple operation
Far too many givin' in
Fall into the dark temptations
Everybody needs a King
Everybody needs a Captain
When you hear the fallen angels sing
In your private Armageddon
And you walk away
(With nowhere to go)
For another day
(Turn the lights down low)
But you'll never know
(While you walk away)
When you walk away with nowhere to go
Everybody had their doubts
So they tried to pull me under
Every time I felt the strain
Someone sent a sense of wonder
Everybody walked the hard road
In the dark they felt the grind
Everybody heard the thunder
No one ever read the signs
And you walk away
(With nowhere to go)
For another day
(Turn the lights down low)
But you'll never know
(While you walk away)
When you walk away with nowhere to go


Have you woke up screaming in the silence of the night?
You wish you could start dreaming but it's always black and white
Looking for that big sky that'll finally make it right
Well everything could change tonight

Nighttime falls it came too fast
Down the halls tiptoeing past
Out come the shadows of life itself
To clap along and wish you well
Motherless children
Wandering nowhere
Look up you're almost home
Reaching for water
Longing to know you're not alone


Have you woke up screaming in the silence of the night?
You wish you could start dreaming in black and white
Well everything could change tonight
When you duel with the devil living in your mind
Motherless children
Wandering nowhere
Look up you're almost home
Reaching for water
Longing to go there
Flooding into your soul
Into your soul...Embed
