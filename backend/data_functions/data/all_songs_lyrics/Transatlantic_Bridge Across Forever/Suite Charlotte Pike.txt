Suite Charlotte Pike LyricsI: If She Runs
If she runs, let her run, run, run
Just hope that she comes back
If she breaks let her break, break, break
Let apologies attract
And is she's free let her be, let her be
She's not in such bad company
The big man's still got her name written on the wall
If she cries let her cry, cry, cry
'Till there isn't anymore
If she laughs, let her cra-a-ack
If that's what she's looking for
And if she waits, let her wait, wait, wait
You'll have to leave this one to fate
It can't ever be too late, when she comes to call
It's Hard -- living with such uncertainty
It's Hard -- climbing the Statue of Liberty
It's Hard -- calming the Beatle inside of me
It's Hard -- missing my Max and Melody
II: Mr. Wonderful
Her lips were ruby red
She had a pretty head
Not even once did she miss Sunday school
Remember what mama said, "Stick to the rules"
This boy was something else
Someone she knew so well
Echoes of snakes in paradise
Saw the strangest fire burning in his eyes
His name is wonderful
And it's wonderful, just to be near him
His name is majesty
And his majesty's requesting your presence
He took her for a ride
Into the starless night
Talked about far away places he's been
Could take her down to the city of sin
"Grab it while you are young
Trust me there's nothing wrong"
But she feared what was 'round the bend
Said "thank you, but no thanks, 'cause I've got a friend"
His name is wonderful
And it's wonderful, just to be near him
His name is majesty
And his majesty's requesting your presence
III: Lost and Found Pt. 1
Don't you think if you could be lost
Don't you think you can be found
Don't you think if you were the world, you'd turn it around
Don't you start looking behind
Best stand up cause this is your time
Don't you think that you'd better start changing your mind
IV: Temple of The Gods
In the Temple of the Gods
We can get it on
In the Temple of the Gods
We will make our home
Far from these Boulevards
We will plunge headlong
In the Temple of the Gods
We will sing this song
Give up all the reasons that you know
Slide down where the time runs nice and slow
Ease back and relax
No figures and no fax
Awakening the stranger in your soul
In the Temple of the Gods
We can get it on
In the Temple of the Gods
We will make our home
Far from these Boulevards
We will plunge headlong
We will sing our song
V: Motherless Children/If She Runs (Reprise)
Left the countryside for the city
She resides now on the second floor
No more gardening in the backyard
Busy keepin' the wolves from the door
Motherless children, ain't going nowhere
Running in circles, time after time
Careless, confused, frozen and faithless
Dreaming this dream to ease in your mind
And if she runs
Let her run
Come on cause now the time has come
The big man's got the mother and the son
Written on the wall
Don't want to hear it now...Embed
