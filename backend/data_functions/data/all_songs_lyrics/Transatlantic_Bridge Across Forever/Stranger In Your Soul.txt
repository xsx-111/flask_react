Stranger In Your Soul Lyrics
Once
Not so long ago
I lived far below
Where you are
I didn't even know
Home was far away
I was sleeping wide awake
Breaking down
Waiting for the sound
But I can't hear it now
Is it all too late?
'Cause I would sell my dreams
If I could be awake
If I could be awake
There
Walking into walls
Piercing through the pain
Here we are
Reaching through the rain
I almost caught a glimpse
To feel that Sunday high
I would fall
This makes no sense at all
But I can't hear it now
Not a single word
And though I'd strain my voice
I cannot be heard
Outside the smile
The insider breaks
And I would give my dreams
If I could be awake
Whatever you're looking for
Don't ever start looking behind
Whatever you want to change
You better start changing your mind
'Cause everything can be done
Stand up 'cause this is your time

Go where you're going to
You can rule your mind
You will not decay
Decay is always waiting
You've got nowhere to go
So you look behind
What you sought to find
Is always fading
Wish to be brainless
Less can live evermore
More doesn't satisfy
The deeper meaning
Lose if you want to find
Find what you're looking for
For all your dreams can live
Live as if to satisfy the meaning
Whatever you're looking for
Don't ever start looking behind
Whatever you want to change
You better start changing your mind
'Cause everything can be done
Stand up 'cause this is your time
Drink in the big dream
Dream but you have to wait
Wait 'til you get it right
Write down every letter
Paint with the broadest strokes
Stroke through the deepest sea
See what you have in mind
To make it better
Get in on the ground floor
Floor to ceiling is so high
High will become the low
It will make sense
Want always wants some more
More is never enough
Enough is enough
Remember life is hanging in the balance
Whatever you're looking for
Don't ever start looking behind
Whatever you want to change
You better start changing your mind
'Cause everything can be done
Stand up 'cause this is your time

Don't you think if you could be lost
Don't you think that you can be found
Don't you think if you were the world, you'd turn it around
Don't you think if you could be lost
Don't you think that you can be found
Don't you think if you were the world, you'd turn it around
Whatever you're looking for
Don't ever start looking behind
Whatever you want to change
You better start changing your mind
'Cause everything can be done
Stand up, stand up 'cause this is your time

In the time it takes to be lost or found
In the wake of something not for the crowd
Awakening the stranger in your soul
It isn't always quite that easy
Awakening the stranger in your soul
All the rage the world goes on outside
It's alright come in here - it's safe to hide
Awakening the stranger in your soul
Is more than just a thought or feeling
There is no wordly danger beyond control
There is so much more than what we're seeing
Awakening the stranger in your soul

Give up all the reasons that you know
Slide down where the time move nice and slow
Ease back and relax
No figures and no fax
Awakening the stranger in your soul
It's alright to give up your control (come in where it's safe-there is no I)
Move along we've paid your expressway toll (look at all the others floating high)
It's the 5:00 am alarm
No time to use your charm
Surrender is the only way to go
Awakening the stranger in your soul
No thought for yourself you just let go

When you come to make love, your only goal
Words cannot describe the feeling
Awakening the stranger in your soul
From the shadow to the deepest meaning
When you come to make love your only goal
Words cannot describe the feeling
Now we're here in full sight - we can be whole
Let's dive and never hit the ceiling
There - walking into walls
Piercing through the pain
Here we are
Reaching through the rain
I almost caught a glimpse
Brighter than the sky
A child grown
A stranger coming home
And I can hear it now
Every single word
And when I strain my voice
I will be assured
Outside the storm
But here the big break
That I might chance to dream
That I be awake
Awakening the stranger in your soulEmbed
