Daniel in the Den Lyrics
Moving along
At a pace unknown to man
Go, go, go, go, go, go, g-go-oh-oh
Go, go, go, go, go-oh

And you thought the lions were bad; well, they tried to kill my brothers
And for every king that died, oh, they would crown another
And it's harder than you think telling dreams from one another
And you thought the lions were bad; well, they tried to kill my brothers

And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you

Dreaming along
At a pace you'll understand
Go, go, go, go, go, go, g-go-oh-oh
No, no, no, no, no-oh

And you thought the lions were bad; well, they tried to kill my brothers
And for every king that died, oh, they would crown another
And it's harder than you think, telling dreams from one another
And you thought the lions were bad; well, they tried to kill my brothers
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you

Oh, to see
What it means to be free
Of the shackles and the dream
That you claim to see

And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you

And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you

And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
