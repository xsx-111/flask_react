Laura Palmer (Abbey Road Sessions) Lyrics
Walking out into the dark
Cutting out a different path
Lead by a beating heart
All the people of the town
Cast their eyes right to the ground
In matters of the heart

The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path up on the ground
You run into the night you can't be found

This is your heart
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Summer evening breezes blew
Drawing voices deep from you
Lead by a beating heart
What's the air and what's the night
What terrifying final sights
Put out your beating heart
The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path up on the ground
You run into the night you can't be found

This is your heart
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it

If you had your gun
Would you shoot it at the sky?
Why - to see where your bullet would fall
Or would it come down at all
If you had your gun
Would you shoot it at the sky?
Why - to see where your bullet would fall
Or would it come down at all?

This is your heart
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
This is your racing heart
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?Embed
