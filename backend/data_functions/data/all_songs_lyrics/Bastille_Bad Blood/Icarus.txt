Icarus Lyrics
Mmmm-m-m-m-mm-m-mm (oh)
O-o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-o-oh, oh
O-o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-o-oh

"Look who's digging their own grave"
That is what they all say; you'll drink yourself to death
Look who makes their own bed, lies right down within it
And what will you have left?

Out on the front doorstep, drinking from a paper cup
You won't remember this
Living beyond your years, acting out all their fears
You feel it in your chest

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus' life, it has only just begun
It's just begun
(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
Standing on the cliff face, highest fall you'll ever grace
It scares me half to death
Look out to the future, but it tells you nothing
So take another breath

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying
Too close to the sun
And Icarus' life
It has only just begun
This is how it feels
To take a fa-a-all
Icarus is flying
Towards an early grave

You put up your defences when you leave
You leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be
You're putting up your armour when you leave
And you leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be, oh
Icarus is flying
Too close to the sun
And Icarus' life
It has only just begun
This is how it feels
To take a fa-a-all
Icarus is flying
Towards an early grave

Oh, oh (O-o-o-o-o-oh)
Oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh, oh, oh (O-o-o-o-o-oh)
Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh (O-o-o-o-o-oh)110Embed
