The Silence Lyrics
Tell me a piece of your history
That you're proud to call your own
Speak in words you picked up
As you walked through life alone
We used to swim in your stories
And be pulled out by their tide
Choking on the words
And drowning with no air inside

Now you've hit a wall and it's not your fault
My dear, my dear, my dear
Now you've hit a wall and you hit it hard
My dear, my dear, oh dear

It is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?
You must have the words
In that head of yours
And, oh, oh, can you feel this silence
I can't take it anymore
'Cause it is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?
Tell me a piece of your history
That you've never said out loud
Pull the rug beneath my feet
And shake me to the ground
Wrap me around your fingers
Break the silence open wide
Before it seeps into my ears
And fills me up from the inside

Now you've hit a wall and you're lost for words
My dear, my dear, my dear
Now you've hit a wall and you hit it hard
My dear, my dear, oh dear

It is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?
You must have the words
In that head of yours
And, oh, oh, can you feel this silence
I can't take it anymore
'Cause it is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?
If you give it a name, then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?
If you give it a name, then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?
If you give it a name, then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?
If you give it a name, then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?

It is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?
You must have the words
In that head of yours
And, oh, oh, can you feel this silence
I can't take it anymore
'Cause it is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?46Embed
