Weight of Living, Pt. I Lyrics
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

There's an albatross around your neck
All the things you've said and the things you've done
Can you carry it with no regrets?
Can you stand the person you've become?

Oh, there's a light
Oh oh oh, there's a light

Your albatross
Let it go, let it go
Oh, your albatross
Shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake the heavy weight
Of living...

Stepping forward out into the day
Shrugging off the dust and memory
Though it's soaring still above your head
It is out of sight and none shall see
Oh, there's a light
Oh oh oh, there's a light

Your albatross
Let it go, let it go
Oh, your albatross
Shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake the heavy weight
Of living
When you just can't seem to shake the weight
Of living

It's the sun in your eyes
In your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes
In your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes
In your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes
In your eyes
Your albatross
Let it go, let it go
Oh, your albatross
Shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake the heavy weight
Of living
When you just can't seem to shake the weight
Of living

The weight of living
The weight of living
The weight of living
The weight of living

Ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
