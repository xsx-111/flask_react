Laughter Lines Lyrics
You took me to your favourite place
On Earth
To see the tree they cut down
Ten years from your birth
Our fingers traced in circles
Round its history
We brushed our hands right back in time
Through centuries

As you held me down
You said:

"I'll see you in the future
When we're older
And we are full of stories
To be told
Crossing my heart
And hope to die
I'll see you with your
Laughter lines"
Changes on our hands
And on our faces, oh, oh
Memories are mapped out
By the lines we'll trace

As you held me down
You said:

"I'll see you in the future
When we're older
And we are full of stories
To be told
Crossing my heart
And hope to die
I'll see you with your
Laughter lines"

Ashen faces in cold breeze
Ashen faces in cold breeze
Armed with stories, you will leave, oh oh
Armed with stories, you will leave
"I'll see you in the future
When we're older
And we are full of stories
To be told
Crossing my heart
And hope to die
I'll see you with your
Laughter lines"

I'll see you in the future
When we're old
I'll see you in the future
When we're old97Embed
