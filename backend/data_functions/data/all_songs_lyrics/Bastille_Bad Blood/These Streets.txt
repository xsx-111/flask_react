These Streets Lyrics
These streets are yours, you can keep them
I don't want them
They pull me back and I surrender
To the memories I run from

Oh, we have paved these streets
With moments of defeat

But even if we won't admit it to ourselves
We'll walk upon these streets and think of little else
So I won't show my face here anymore
Oh, I won't show my face here anymore

These streets are yours, you can keep them
In my mind, it's like you haunt them
And passing through, I think I see you
In the shapes of other women

Oh, we have stained these walls
With our mistakes and flaws
But even if we won't admit it to ourselves
We'll walk upon these streets and think of little else
So I won't show my face here anymore
Oh, I won't show my face here anymore

(All that’s left behind)
Is a shadow on my mind (Shadow on my mind)
Oh, a shadow cast upon the wall is silhouette and nothing more (Shadow on my mind)
That is all that's left behind (All that's left behind)

But even if we won't admit it to ourselves
We'll walk upon these streets and think of little else
So I won't show my face here anymore
Oh, I won't show my face here anymore

I won't show my face here anymore
I won't show my face here anymore90Embed
