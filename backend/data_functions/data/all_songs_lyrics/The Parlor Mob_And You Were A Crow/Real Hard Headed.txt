Real Hard Headed LyricsIn the time I chased the wolves I was a juvenile baby
I cut my nine on any friend or foe
I took my chance on rumor's dance and ruined them lady
I mash them down wherever they may roam
Cause I'm rude, and real hard headed
Cause I'm rude, don't you forget it
My clan is tough, my face is rough from weather and booze
My game is stiff so you know I never lose
The women call and when they do I comfort them
I love so long no creature could contend
Cause I'm rude, and real hard headed
Cause I'm rude, don't you forget it
Pray to God for forgiveness
For all that I have done
Pray to Mary for mercy
That I may not run
The hangman's noose is falling
In the crisp autumn air
See them sway from the gallows, baby
As my soul did prepare
Cause I'm rude, and real hard headed
Cause I'm rude, don't you forget it
Cause I'm rude, and real hard headed
Cause I'm rude, don't you forget itEmbed
