Carnival Of Crows LyricsCome on people get together
Cause you know the time is coming
The wolves beneath you on the prowl
Are crowded round you shouting something
And it ain't easy to find a friend inside another fascination
But it's much harder to find a lover in another observation
Oh, I got that feeling once again
That everything around is gonna end
So who was watching when their soured souls
Came marching right down through here
And made believe they were a carnival of crows
Without any fear
Threw their glasses to the floor
Free of consequences for cowards
And kicked up their final daisy
Far before their final hour
And oh I got that feeling once again
That everything around is gonna end
And oh I got that feeling once again
That everything around is gonna end
Now everybody gather round me
For another story to tell
The angry clouds on the horizon
Seas around you starting to swell
Thunder's going to have to crash
And the rain is going to fall
And then the first will be the last
Can you hear the children call?
I know you can
And oh I got that feeling once again
That everything around is gonna end
And oh I got that feeling once again
That everything around is gonna end
Come on people, get together
Cause you know the time is coming
The wolves beneath you on the prowl
Are crowded round you, baby
And they're shouting something
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
