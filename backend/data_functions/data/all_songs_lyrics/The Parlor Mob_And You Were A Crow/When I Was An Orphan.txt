When I Was An Orphan LyricsI can see your face
Call it breaking me alright
Pretty soon your heart will be gone
You can have the best of me
I'll just take the rest of me
Why are we growing apart?
Ripping out the guts
Where there's something to save
Can you take more, take more
All I've asked for
Can you make sure, make sure
I come after
Passin out your plastic that
Couldn't care, couldn't care
Tell your turn and back that
I'll trade you for no one
When I was an orphan and you were a crow
I couldn't believe you were sayin it so
I held out my arms like love was such a laugh
Oh, I follow forgiveness back to the sun
If you and I were the only ones to stay
Well how is it supposed to be now?
I can see the bones of indifference, it's sickening
Sticking through the side of the fool I became
Another photograph to kiss me in the morning
How can I call you back you don't treat me the same
Can you fake more, fake more
Childish laughter
Can you make sure, make sure
I come after
Lipstick on the glass left to figure out, figure out
Patch your pretty promise it's the gift that you gave
When you were a daughter and I was the sky
I never remember feelin so bad
You pulled my hair and I smashed your telephone
Oh, your set in your ways
Not changing for me
And I said it so clear
Still you didn't agree
You just left it to chance
As if some way it's free
And it failed
How is it supposed to be now?
Starting a sentance is getting us nowhere
Heart from the hope that you held in your hand
Starting a sentance is getting us nowhere
Heart from the hope that you held in your hand
Can you take more, take more
All I ask for
Can you make sure, make sure
I come after
Can you take more, take more
All I ask for
Can you make sure, make sure
I come afterEmbed
