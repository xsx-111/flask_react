Dead Wrong LyricsThe time has come for you to look around
Remember every moment that you found
The best way to say yes is to say no
When all you got to do you got to do is say it so
But when it's wrong, it's wrong
Dead wrong
It's easy just too easy to deny
And never be the one to compromise
When everyone's a friendly face to you
Tell me what you, tell me what you, tell me what you gonna do
Cause when it's wrong, it's wrong
Dead wrong
Did you sell your soul from sleep cause that ain't right?
Did you think your peace would last you through the night?
Is it worth the time it takes to say hello?
Tell me cause I really, cause I really, cause I got to know
But when it's wrong, it's wrong
Yeah when it's wrong, it's wrong
Dead wrong
It's easy just too easy to deny
And never be the one to compromise
When it's wrong, it's wrong
Yeah when it's wrong, it's wrong
