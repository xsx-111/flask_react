My Favorite Heart To Break LyricsI cannot cut this fairy tale
And treat you how I please
Thank you for the fun of it
And leave you on your knees
Tear your little heart out
Where everyone can see
Place it right beside you
And ask you not to bleed
And how could I care for
Not to leave you temporary
Hangouts got me feeling for no one
And oh how I let you down
I could count your tears
Just to stay around
My favorite heart to break
Feel to fret to bravery, don't you call my quite
Push it down a stair case
Cause what else would be right
Kiss you on your forehead
And hold your pretty hand
Leave you for the moment
I know where you stand
And how could I ask for
Taking me so seriously
And I can see you'll be waiting for hours
And oh how I let you down
I could count your tears
Just to stay around
My favorite heart to break
My favorite heart to break
Missus so sad
And I can tell you I need everything
You hoped I would as well
Turn it around and I can see, I can see
With everything shake of your breath you believed me more
And oh how I let you down
I could count your tears
Just to stay around
My favorite heart to break
My favorite heart to breakEmbed
