The Kids LyricsThe kids in town don't care about the rules you've been making, no
They only feel the beating of their hearts
They're all hip to the lives that you've been taking
Where you take them
They'll take their time but they'll take you apart
But tonight, yeah
No, the kids ain't alright
But tonight
No, the kids ain't alright, the kids ain't alright
The kids ain't alright, the kids ain't alright
Listen to them
The alley cats brace their fists for destruction, Lord
For it seems to me that they've been warned
They are the lives of your construction
Where you touch them
Out of your hands their burdens born
But tonight, yeah
No, the kids ain't alright
But tonight
No, the kids ain't alright, the kids ain't alright
The kids ain't alright, the kids ain't alright
Listen to them
Tell me what's your fascination
With money, greed, and all you've done, yeah
And when you reach your destination
Will it be worth it all your fun
All your fun, yeah
C'mon baby
C'mon mama
Cause tonight
No, the kids ain't alright
Cause tonight
No, the kids ain't alright, the kids ain't alright
The kids ain't alright, the kids ain't alright
