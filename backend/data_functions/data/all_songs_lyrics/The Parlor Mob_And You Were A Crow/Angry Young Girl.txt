Angry Young Girl LyricsYou're so quiet baby, but you're so mean
Sooner or later you'll have to come clean
That you're an angry young girl
You're so calm, you're so smart
I held your hand, you stole my heart
Cause you're an angry young girl
And it won't be long 'til they sing along
And it goes
You're an eagle, but you will crow
Maybe the devil, but all I know
Is you're an angry young girl
You're so calm, but you're so cruel
Shout me out loud, make me look like a fool
Cause you're an angry young girl
And it won't be long 'til they sing along
And it goes
You're so quiet, but you're so mean
Sooner or later you'll have to come clean
That you're an angry young girl
You're an eagle, but you're a crow
Maybe the devil, but all I know
Is you're an angry young girl
And it won't be long 'til they sing along
And it goesEmbed
