Tide Of Tears LyricsSafe in the arms that hold your every move
They've been waiting here for you
You've been weighing down the time
In a place they tried to forget
In a face they'd grow to regret
They pulled down, they pulled down the shades
Crawling
Lord, they're crawling
Can you save them now they're crawling?
Would you catch them if they're falling?
Do you hear them when they're calling?
The water down here swells with the seeds of decay
Through the years
The sins of our fathers swept our love
For each other away
In the tide, in the tide, in the tide of tears
Snakes in suits conduct their interviews
Bodies floating down the avenue
And it's our sickness, and it's our sickness to blame
Ain't no party blue or red
Where innocence for naught is shed
And it's our choices, and it's our voices to be heard
Drowning
Lord, they're drowning
And the good Lord is frowning
And them dark clouds are surrounding
We must decide
The water out here swells with the seeds of decay
Through the years
Have the sings of our fathers swept our love
For each other away?
In the tide, in the tide, in the tide, in the tide
Tide of tears now
Tide of tears now
In the tide, in the tide
Oh, yeah
While there's life, there's hope for change
As a culture now got to rearrange
Ain't no blind eye left to turn
Lying
Lord, they're lying
And the children keep dying
Whil the mothers are crying
Don't you know we should be trying
The water down here swells with the sins of decay
The sins of our fathers swept our love, our love away
In the tide, in the tide, in the tide, in the tide of tearsEmbed
