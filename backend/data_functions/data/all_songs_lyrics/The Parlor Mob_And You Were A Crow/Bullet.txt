Bullet LyricsWhen you're wasted all the time
You ain't doing yourself no good
Now baby you better change your mind
You ain't fooling nobody round here
The only friend you ever had now baby
Has long disappeared
And I'm a mean little man
But I do the best I can
Woman I try, try, try, try
Yet you gonna still testify, still testify, still testify
And after all is said and done
And after all is said and done
And after all baby is said and done
You cannot take the bullet out the gun
You been hurt now, baby
You been used
And I can see in the way you hang your head
Darling how you been abused
Is it sad for you
Like it's sad for me
I can do the best to hold your hand
Now darling but you gotta try to agree
And I'm a mean little man
But I do the best i can
Woman I try, try, try, yeah yeah
Yet you're gonna
Still you're gonna
You know you oughta oh
And after all is said and done
And after all is said and done
And after all baby is said and done
You cannot take the bullet out the gun
Whoa now baby don't you wanna try to help me out
Whoa now baby don't you wanna try try try try try try try
Whooooa
You been hurt now baby
You been used
I can see in the way you hang your head
Darling how you been abused
Is it sad for you
Like it's sad for me
I can do the best to hold your head
Now baby but you gotta try
And after all is said and done
And after all is said and done
And after all baby is said and done
You cannot take the bullet out the...
