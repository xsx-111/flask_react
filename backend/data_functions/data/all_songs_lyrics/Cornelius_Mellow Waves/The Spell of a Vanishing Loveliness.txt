The Spell of a Vanishing Loveliness LyricsThe sweetest child
She is the apple of our eyes
She smiles, delights
Does everything we say is right
The perfect child
I never say what's on my mind
I try to hide
Keep everything I feel inside
Still, that's not enough
The sweetest girl
Her love will take away my hurt
Her thoughts, her words
Follow me halfway 'round the world
The perfect man
I give him everything I can
My life, my child
This is now everything I am
Still, that's not enough
That was yesterday
Time to walk away
Goodbye innocence
Now I need a friend
I have many friends
This is how it endsEmbed
