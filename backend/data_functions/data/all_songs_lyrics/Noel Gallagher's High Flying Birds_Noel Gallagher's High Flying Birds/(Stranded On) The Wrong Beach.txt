(Stranded On) The Wrong Beach Lyrics
Falling, I see you on the way down
I'll meet you on the rebound
Or somewhere in between
Calling out across the airwaves
Faces that you can't save
Are calling out for me

And oh me, oh my!
Say so long, baby, bye-bye
Pour me one for the road
It's a long journey, baby
Where it's going to take me
Just depends on the weight of my load, oh no
Depends on the weight of my load

Sail on, I'll see you in the next one
'Cause everybody's been and gone
There's no one here but me

And oh me, oh my!
Say so long, baby, bye-bye
Pour me one for the road
It's a long journey, baby
Where it's going to take me
Just depends on the weight of my load, oh no
Depends on the weight of my load

And oh me, oh my!
Say so long, baby, bye-bye
Pour me one for the road
It's a long journey, baby
Where it's going to take me
Just depends on the weight of my load, oh no
Depends on the weight of my load, oh no
Depends on the weight of my load, oh no
Depends on the weight of my load

Dry land sinking in the quicksand
Stranded on the wrong beach
Come and rescue me2Embed
