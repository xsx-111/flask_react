If I Had a Gun... Lyrics
If I had a gun
I'd shoot a hole into the sun
And love would burn this city down for you
If I had the time
I'd stop the world and make you mine
And every day would stay the same with you
I'll give you back a dream
Show you now what might have been
If all the tears you cry would fade away (away, away, away...)
I'll be by your side
When they come to say goodbye
We will live to fight another day

Excuse me if I spoke too soon
My eyes have always followed you around the room
'Cause you're the only God that I will ever need
I'm holding on, I'm waiting for the moment to find me

Hope I didn't speak too soon
My eyes have always followed you around the room
'Cause you're the only God that I will ever need
I'm holding on, I'm waiting for the moment
For my heart to be unbroken by the sea
Let me fly you to the moon
My eyes have always followed you around the room
'Cause you're the only God that I will ever need
I'm holding on, I'm waiting for the moment to find me

If I had a gun
I'd shoot a hole into the sun
And love would burn this city down for you6Embed
