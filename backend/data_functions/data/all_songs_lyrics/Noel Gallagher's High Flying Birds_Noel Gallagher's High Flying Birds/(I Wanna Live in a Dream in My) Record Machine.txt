(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine Lyrics
Help me
Define the light that's shining on me
To get back what they've taken from me
And build a little fire where it's cold
Show me
The path that leads to all the glory
The words that tell a sacred story
And build a little fire where it's cold

I wanna live in a dream
In my record machine
I want a piece of the world
And everyone inside my mouth
And all the money I waste
Is it a matter of taste?
I want a piece of the world
And you can't make me spit it out

Take me
Back from the darkness where they sent me
Give hope to places where it can't be
And build a little fire where it's cold
I wanna live in a dream
In my record machine
I want a piece of the world
And everyone inside my mouth
And all the money I waste
Is it a matter of taste?
I want a piece of the world
And you can't make me spit it out

You can't give me a reason
I don't need one to shine
You can't give me a feeling
If it's already mine
'Cause I'm one in a million
And if the sun don't rise on my soul
Then I'll blowEmbed
