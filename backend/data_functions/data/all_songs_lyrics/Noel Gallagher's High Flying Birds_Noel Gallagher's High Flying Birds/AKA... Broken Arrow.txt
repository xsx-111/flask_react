AKA... Broken Arrow Lyrics
A fallen angel with a broken arrow
She come for me and ease my troubled mind
Shine a light out into the shadows
Of a world they made me leave behind

Leave me in peace, I'm on the side of the angels
If I die in dream, then let me live my life
But all the lies that they have told me
They make me wanna shiver
When I'm lost and I'm lonely
That's not going to ease my troubled mind

She roll in over a misty morning
Setting sail for where the four winds blow
She's the siren and I'm the warning
Here to say I never told you so

Leave me in peace, I'm on the side of the angels
If I die in dream, then let me live my life
But all the lies that they have told me
They make me wanna shiver
When I'm lost and I'm lonely
That's not going to ease my troubled mind

Leave me in peace, I'm all alone with my angel
She died in a dream so I could live my life
But all the lies that they have told me
They make me wanna shiver
When I'm lost and I'm lonely
That's not going to ease my troubled mind
That's not going to ease my troubled mind

A fallen angel with a broken arrow
She come for me and ease my troubled mind
Shine a light out into the shadows
Of a world they made me leave behind2Embed
