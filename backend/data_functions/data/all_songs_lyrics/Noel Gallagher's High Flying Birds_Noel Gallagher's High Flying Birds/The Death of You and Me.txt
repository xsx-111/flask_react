The Death of You and Me Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4

High tide, summer in the city
The kids are looking pretty
But isn't it a pity
That the sunshine is followed by a thunder
And thoughts of going under
And is it any wonder

Why the sea's calling out to me
I seem to spend my whole life running
From people who would be
The death of you and me
'Cause I can feel the storm clouds
Sucking up my soul

High tide, life is getting faster
No one has the answer
I try to face the day now in a new way
The bottom of a bottle
'Cause every man's a puzzle
Let's run away together you and me
Forever we'd be free
Free to spend our whole lives running
From people who would be
The death of you and me
'Cause I can feel the storm clouds
Sucking up my soul

Let's run away to sea
Forever we'd be free
Free to spend our whole lives running
From people who would be
The death of you and me
'Cause I can feel the storm clouds coming

I'm watching my tv
Or is it watching me?
I see another new day dawning
It's rising over me, with my mortality
And I can feel the storm clouds
Sucking up my soul4Embed
