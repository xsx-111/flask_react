Stop the Clocks Lyrics
Stop the clocks and turn the world around
Let your love lay me down
And when the night is over, there’ll be no sound
Lock the box and leave it all behind
On the backseat of my mind
And, when the night is over, where will I rise?

What if I’m already dead?
How would I know?
What if I’m already dead?
How would I know?

Lost inside my head behind a wall
Do they hear me when I call?
And, when the night is over, where will I fall?
And, when the night is over, where will I fall?

What if I’m already dead?
How would I know?
What if I’m already dead?
How would I know?
Stop the clocks and turn the world around
Let your love lay me down
And, when the night is over, there’ll be no sound
And, when the night is over, there’ll be no sound
And now the night is over, there’ll be no sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound...1Embed
