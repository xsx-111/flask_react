Dream On Lyrics
Oh me, oh my!
I'm running out of batteries
I'm hanging from a ladder
The tears you cry
Are only meant to flatter me
But shit don't matter at all
Taking the shots as I fall
Watching the wheels go round and round
Serene in the air 'cause I love you lady, I...

Dream on
Was that songbird singing?
Shout it out for me
Shout it out for me
So come on now...

One day at a time
I'm hiding from the razor blade
That's hanging in the kitchen
The kids outside
They drunk up all their lemonade
The bitch keeps bitching 'n' all
Taking the shots as I fall
Wait for the wheels to come round and round
Serene in the air 'cause I love you lady, I...
Dream on
Was that songbird singing?
Shout it out for me
Shout it out for me
Dream on
'Cause it's got no meaning
Shout it out for me
Shout it out for me

She go
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Dream on
Was that songbird singing?
Shout it out for me
Shout it out for me
Dream on
'Cause it's got no meaning
Shout it out for me
Shout it out for me

Shout it for me (come on), shout it for me (come on)
Shout it for me (come on), shout it for me (come on)
Shout it for me (come on), shout it for me (come on)
Shout it for me (come on), shout it for me (come on)
Shout it for me (come on), shout it for me2Embed
