Till the Bitter End LyricsThrough sleet and snow and storm and hail
Through every degradation and betrayal
Past rhyme and reason and beyond the pale
Darling
I will love you till the bitter end...
And all the bitter moments till then
Through time and tomb and Tim and Tom
Through pro and con and quid pro quo and qualm
Through tidal wave and asteroid and bomb
Darling
I will love you till the bitter end...
And all the bitter moments till then
And when your charms begin to fade
And when you feel old and afraid
I'll scratch beneath your shoulder blade and whisper:
"My love is deeper than I show
Remember what I said:
'Through sleet and snow...'
So even though I know you have to go, darling
I will love you till the bitter end...
And all the bitter moments till then"Embed
