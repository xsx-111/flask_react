Xavier Says LyricsXavier says, "Ha-ha-ha
We have nothing in common
See you around. ta-ta
Slink back to your abominable lover
Zsa Zsa, before I blow your cover
Tra-la-la."
Zsa Zsa's scene: "Tacky queen
You think there's no one but you?
Get your crass little ass
Out and don't make me cut you
With how much you
Talk, you'd think that someone else was listening
Want a drink, Miss Thing?"
"Slow gin fizz," says Xavier
Zsa Zsa orders, and drinks come
"Here it is, teddy bear."
"To your health, you ratfink scum,"
Xavier wheezes
I forgot: before each line he sneezes
Quite a lotEmbed
