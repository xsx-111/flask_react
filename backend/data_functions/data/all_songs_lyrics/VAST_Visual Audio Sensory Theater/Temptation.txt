Temptation LyricsI went in the desert
I went searching for the truth
I stumbled across you
And I know you're not the truth
I went in the ocean
I came looking for some love
All I found is that I found
I haven't found enough
I stand alone now I stand alone
But can you save me from myself
You are my temptation
You are my temptation to
Do what I knew was wrong
You are my temptation
You are my temptation to
Do what I knew was wrong
What I knew was wrong was you
I stand alone now I stand alone
But can you save me from myself
Oh please
They've been killing children
And nobody seems to care
They've been laughing at my god
My god I wouldn't dare
You are my temptation
You are my temptationEmbed
