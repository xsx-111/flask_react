Flames LyricsClose your eyes
Let me touch you now
Let me give you something
That is real
Close the door
Leave your fears behind
Let me give you
What you're giving me
You are the only thing
That makes me want to live at all
When I am with you
There's no reason to pretend that
When I am with you
I feel flames again
Just put me inside you
I would never ever leave
Just put me inside you
I would never ever leave youEmbed
