Pretty When You Cry LyricsYou're made of my rib oh baby
You're made of my sin
And I can't tell where your lust ends
And where your love begins
I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you
I didn't want to hurt you
But you're pretty when you cry
And the moon gives me permission
And I enter through her eyes
She's losing her virginity
And all her will to compromise
I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you
I didn't want to hurt you
But you're pretty when you cry

I didn't want to fuck you baby
I didn't want to fuck you
I didn't want to fuck you
But you're pretty when you're mine
I didn't really love you baby
I didn't really love you
I didn't really love you
But I'm pretty when I lie
You hurt me baby
I hurt you baby
(How could you do this to me now)
If you knew how much I love you
You would run away
But when I treat you bad
It always makes you want to stay
I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you baby!
I didn't want to hurt you baby!Embed
