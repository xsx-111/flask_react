Three Doors LyricsThey whisper words into my ears
One speaks of truth and one speaks of my fears
My disabilities don't get in my way
I look to the future and live day to day
Three doors to go through
I only want the one that leads to you
They say there's three doors go through
I only want the one that leads to you
Because only one leads to you
And who's to blame?
I could assume
The loneliness of my white room
I saw the circles
Inside the squares
And yet it can be so hard to be aware
Three doors to go through
I only want the one that leads to you
They say there's three doors go through
I only want the one that leads to you
Because only one leads to you
This is your only chance at immortality
I'll give you strength
But i cannot give you the keysEmbed
