Here LyricsWhere do I put the shame?
It feels like a broken toy
I can't play with anymore
Where do I put the hate?
To a pixilated screen
I can't watch anymore
All I know is that I'm here
Drifting somewhere in the vast
Somewhere in eternity
And I never want to leave
Where do I put the books
There's so many I could read
But they all are filled with lies
Where do I put the lies
There's so many I could say
But it seems they're in the books
I have faith that you're out there
Living high up in the vast
Somewhere in eternity
And you're never going to leave
Have I been telling lies to myself?
Hold me now
You know I'm so afraid to be
At all
Have I been telling lies to myself?
Hold me now
You know I'm so afraid to love
At all
I looked up and I saw the moon
Is it the same one that betrayed you?
I looked up and I saw my place
I looked in and I felt no hate
Where do I put the love?
Where do I put the love?Embed
