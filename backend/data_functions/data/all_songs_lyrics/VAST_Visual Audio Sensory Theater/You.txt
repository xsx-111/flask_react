You LyricsYour dress
Looks good on you my love
And your house looks like it's heaven
Why are there
So many people outside of it
Everything you have will be
Oh you can't take anything with you
Except the love
The love that I have for you
Your eyes look like they're from god
And your face looks like it's from god
Why are you
Going to be
Outside eternity
Everything we know will be
Oh you can't take anything with you
Except the love
The love that I have for you
I know you want toEmbed
