The Niles Edge LyricsMy name spells joy
I can't remember darkness
Except a dream
You saved my life
Do you wonder what you saw
Floating softly at the Niles edge
Wandering eyes
Commitments never can last
It feels so cold
To know our name
I've never known you
And I never will
What difference
Does indifference takes
Do you regret what you saw
Floating softly at the Niles edge
Alone
Do you regret
Regret what you did
Running softly
Softly from the Niles edge
Alone
Somewhere else to be
Every time that I cry out
No one ever comes to me
Every time that I reach out
No one ever rescues me
I wish I could hide from
Everyone
Is there somewhere else to be
Is there somewhere else to be
Take me in
I want out
That's all I need
I wish I could run from
EverythingEmbed
