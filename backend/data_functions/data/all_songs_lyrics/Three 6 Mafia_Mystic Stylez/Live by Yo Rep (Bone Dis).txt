Live by Yo Rep (Bone Dis) Lyrics
Man, it's cold as a mothafucka
I wish I had some more funk or something, mane
This is Shaquisha Shalonda, Bone Magazine
Here interviewing the Triple 6 Mafia from Memphis
Who has a unique quality of rap style
What would you do if someone tried to duplicate your ideas?

Well, I shall take a 1000 razor blades and press them in their flesh (Damn)
Take my pitchfork out the fire, soak it in their chest
Through the ribs, spines, charcoal the muscle tissue
And send what's left back to yo mammy
'Cause that bitch might miss you
But first, I want to slowly peel off all your skin
Degreaser boilin' hot, pour it on you, and your dead friends
I probably, oughta be, not be so horribly slaughtering the body
I am so naughty because I am moderately into photography
Following through the autopsy
But man, fuck it, pour some acid on them, too
That's what I would do, Skinny Pimp what would you do?

Just look into the eyes of the mask
Slangin' the AK to knock out my enemy
Fear of the wraith to the blast, he done passed
Leavin' no trace of the evidence
Bodies rest in a box chopped up in pieces
His soul done rose, I place them tubes up under my mattress
My conscience is black and it's strange
Cause I murdered a bitch, and the Devil just rushin' my time
With this 9 in my hand, causin' death when you sleep
In the casket, I make you no killas in mind
Pullin a jack, reach me that cheese
Make a stupid move, nigga ya bleed
Bustin' 17, please don't scream
Don't run either, long range, we sweep
Never-never run from the buckshots, bust 'em at ya back
When I'm full of Yac, ain't no clue
In too deep, you sneak, we creep
Juicemane, what would you do?
First a nigga look in the white pages for this bitch
It's Mafia style, nigga, cause you don't know who ya fuckin' wit
Called him at his fuckin home
Nothing but breathin' on the phone (hello? hello?)
Warnin' sign to let you know I'm comin', so you better be gone
Whether ya run I be stoppin' ya
With the two nines, I be poppin' ya
Witness a nigga from North Memphis of the Triple 6 Mafia
2 killas at yo front door, 3 killas at yo back door
These hoes peeked through the curtains
And saw them gats pointed at the window
Nothin' but destruction after we touched 'em
Man, I thought you knew
That's what I would do, Gangsta Boo what would you do?

They called off a master plan on how to buck them bitches dead
Gangsta Boo, the Devil's Daughter, comin' with the livin' dead
Yes I'm so-so crazy, so-so scandalous
I will hurt you bitch (Lay down hoe!)
Torture your body with nothin' but fire
Then I calmly shoot you bitch
Blast you in yo head, make sure you dead
'Cause I don't want you to live
My words of wisdom: the weaker the victim the bigger the thrill
The Triple 6 Mafia do not feel sorry for none of you dirty hoes
We full of that weed, so we proceed to take your fuckin' soul
It's not our problem when I buck you, bitch, I do it smooth
That's what the Devil's Daughter do
Now Fly, what would you do?
Clizick with the real Triple 6 niggas for yo death
Ain't no shame up in my game as you take your last breath
Six niggas trill, ready to kill, bustas, suckas jump (Jump Bitch!)
Pulled a fucked up clickin', on you niggas, Fly gon' ball, you punk
To you fuckin imitators, watch yo ass fuckin' click
Bite a Playa's style and slip, soon you will be stackin', bitch
Fly gon' bring them body bags
Lord, you touch your fork and shovel
Dig it deep and buried bitch
Playa dinin' with the Devil
Busta numb, redruM, Mr. I-B-N, fool
Oh, that's what Lil Fly would do
Now Killaman, what would you do?

First, I hit up Crunchy, and I get full of the Holy Ghost
The Devil's already in me, so I ain't gotta go too far to look
You fucked off with the wrong click
So your murder's all on my mind
Plus Satan's inside, I put my hand to this plastic 9
Burnin' from the aim, my Glock knows more every blink of the eye
But before it's all over, you'll have two Lugers in your weak thighs
Fall on to your knees, now it's time for you to 'fess
My fist full of fire, I punch a hole straight through yo chest
So any trick that wanna bite of this, everything, it's cool
You heard what I would do, and the Triple 6 whole fuckin crew
Bitch
Nigga, live by yo rep but I ain't takin shit
When I blast on yo ass, I'm gon' empty this clip
Nigga, live by yo rep but I ain't takin shit
When I blast on yo ass, I'm gon' empty this clip
Nigga, live by yo rep but I ain't takin shit
When I blast on yo ass, I'm gon' empty this clip
Nigga, live by yo rep but I ain't takin shit
When I blast on yo ass, I'm gon' empty this clip

See we can't tolerate no nigga that is Layzie
Broke out the blender and I made some Krayzie gravy
It's Eazy, and when it was time to get Bizzy, don't break
You can Wish, but you can't escape (No escape, nigga)
Because we crave dead Flesh
Triple 6 bitch, easily you can be next

Yeah, bitch, the Triple 6 Mafia
Breakin motherfuckin bones like it ain't shit
For the nine-nickle, beeyaaaaaatch!
Yeah
Triple Six Mafia for the '95 Memphis, nigga
Hooooooe!12Embed
