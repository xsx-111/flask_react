Da Summa Lyrics
Uh huh, the Three 6 Mafia loungin' in the studio
Finna give y'all a little demonstration
Of how we kick it here in the M-Town
Finna drop it somethin' like this

See in Memphis, them players be kind of like laid back
In some clean ass rides, blunts in the sack, I'm blowin' a pack
Hittin' the park about three, sometimes a little later
The last day of the week, and they couldn't get any greater
They leaving the park, and hittin' the South Park strip, ride
The South Gate skatin' ring later on that night
We in the lot, boomin' our underground rap tapes
Paul and Juicy Part 2, and for another one, they just couldn't wait
We back at the crib, sweatin' in a lil' room
W-30's, SP-12's and MPCs we use
Straight from the 4 track, to a simple cassette
That's through a pimpsta's mode
Now it's time to hit the stereos stores and collect
We at the club Friday's and Saturday's special request made
Me and Juiceman hit the tables, Koop and Scarecrow rock the stage
They get so buck that some fools always gotta start a fight
They usually made us close up early that night
In the summer, in the summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out

Drunk off red dog as we ball through the mystic fog
Me, Scarecrow, Crunchy, Skinny, Gin and my roadie Paul
Fly got his mind up in the sky as we chiefin' high
Black Glocks, that's in the ride, fiendin' for a homicide
Some Tanqueray, grab my yay, mixed with little Siz
That's how we always did it since I was a troubled kid
But we don't stop, 'cause our heart is pumpin' blood like thunder
No man up in the trauma, head is broken in the summer

Seasons of the summer, the Scarecrow won't stop ceremonies
'Til the sun sets me ease, until the night fall breeze
Rise up to the darkness, listen close to noises in the streets
Grab my Oz. of Indonesia, 6 philly blunt leafs
Throw on me black khaki slacks and me black t-shirt
And my automatic gat, in case I have to dig a plot of dirt
Then hit Paul up on his home, tell him to bring his slow ass on
So we can hit the honey comb before the ganja's gone
The summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out
Pass the E & J, Koop
Then let's take a ride and shoot
To the high school, North Side where the players rule
I'm scopin' all the freaks, with some weave and a sexy switch
"Can I get your number?"
"I got a man"
Well I'mma holla, trick
Ballin' down Valentine, one time on my mind
If they pull me over, I be hopin' they won't find the nine
Made enough from evergreen to holla at Blac and Cam
Chiefin' on the blunts, in the alley, slangin' boulder, yeah
Couldn't forget my roadie Big Kurt, Swally and Dion
Project Pat and the L  shootin' teflon
Just a few homies who I grew up in the hood with me
And the ones in Orange Blossom Hubert University, yeah
It's gettin' late, and now I'm ballin' down Eldridge street
Blowin' my horn, tryin' to get this girl' attention in front of me
'Cause everyday I might go tryin' to get a freak number
That's how the Juice is, in the summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood, with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
With my crew, we just ride (That's how we do it)

So that's how it is, the Three 6 Mafia in the house for the '95
Straight from the M-Town
The Juice, DJ Paul, Lord Infamous, the Scarecrow
The Koopsta Knicca, and Crunchy Black
