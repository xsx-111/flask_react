In da Game Lyrics
Dope game cocaine
Dope game, dope-dope game cocaine
Dope game cocaine
Dope game, dope-dope game cocaine
Dope game cocaine
Dope game, dope-dope game cocaine
Dope game cocaine
Dope game, dope-dope game cocaine

Dope game, my game, hoes lame, it's a shame
How the Gangsta Boo is gonna click up on you bitches, mane
Gangsta Boo is not the kind of bitch that will like get punked out
Looks are so deceivin', stupid bitch, you wanna f-izz-ind out?
How can ya fuck a playa, playa hataz better listen close
If you try to buck me bitch, I'm outie with you fuckin' soul
Yes the Devils Daughter, kind of caught up bitch that wish the slip
Slip yo ass in a coffin bitch, because you run your fuckin lip
Hoe, my game is thick, so stupid bitch, don't ever test me, hoe
If I fucked up once, you fucked up twice, so hoe, you gotta go
Listen deep, this pimpin' really quick before I split your dome
Hoe, you tryna cross me in this game, and stupid hoe, its on

Just a flodgin' ass nigga with a lot of cheese
Heard he stackin' G's everyday, pushin' plenty ki's
A nigga don't know me 'cause I ain't no phony
And I ain't the nigga you can whoop, and call me Toby
Lowkey on his ass, waitin' for the night to come
So I can kick down his door and make him give me some
Bitch I was a little young nigga, age thirteen
Fucked up in town, while I watched yo ass ride clean
Now that Im grown up, from the hood I gained nuts
Nigga you gon' drop off that dope, or feel the pain of a hollow tip
Rip through your shit, or your fuckin' brain
That's what you get when you chose to play the dope game
Bitch!
In da game (Dope game cocaine)
Dope game dope-dope game cocaine
In da game (Dope game cocaine)
Dope game dope-dope game cocaine
In da game (Dope game, dope game, dope game)
Dope game, dope game, dope game, dope game
Dope, dope game, dope game, dope game
In da game
Dope, dope game, dope game, dope game, dope game, dope

I'm at the cut, droppin' the fiend down with the monkey nuts
I'm tired, I'm hittin' 'em short, I gotta get over, I don't give a fuck
The shit goes on from sun-up till sun-down and on the 12 I guess
But now its time to cut the shit, where's my minds at my best
I gotta test a nigga to see what he gankin' a fool
Make you straight a couple of G's, I need more cheese
I'm layin' 'em down on his face, but don't waste time
I gotta roll straight through the shit, sometimes I wonder will it end
Cause I rob for petty shit, I'm riskin' my life pullin' yo card
After y'all, I push him off the wood grain and I pop off his smile
A one eighty spot
I'm dodgin' the cops, watchin' my b-izz-ag fools, kinda like a snitch
But when they do my boys, I find they house and goin' up in that shit
Check-check it out, nigga I'm kickin' in doors, bodies are froze
Bloody ya clothes, gun to ya nose
All of you niggas, you really need to give up money and dope
Face the floor, forty-four, into ya head, droppin 'em dead
Infamous fled, put them to bed, with the weight, then escape
Count the stacks, shine my gat, after I jack like a rat on the creep
All you dope boy niggas will get put to sleep
When I sneak, give up the dope or get a hole in yo cranium
You see this mean artillery you know it is containin' some
Shit that makes me flexible to make your life ejectable
And with this bullet in your brain, you be dead either comatose
So when you pushin' candy with the Scarecrow comin' to smoke you, mane
Simple and plain, you'll get stained, if you in the dope game, bitch

In da game (Dope game cocaine)
Dope game, dope-dope game cocaine
Trapped in da game (Dope game cocaine)
Dope game dope-dope game cocaine
In da game (Dope game, dope game, dope game)
Dope game, dope game, dope game, dope game
Dope, dope game, dope game, dope game
Trapped in da game
Dope, dope game, dope game, dope game, dope
In da game
Trapped in da game
In da game
Trapped in da game
Aw yeah, we in this mothafucka
Y'all know what time it is
My nigga  on bass
Archie Love on the engineering, boys
You know what I'm sayin'
We doin' shit for all my little niggas in the game
Lil Nick, Big Dre, my brother Phil did a drive by on the game
Lil Darius, Shawn Baby, Big W, Brian Jay, Lil Toby, Lil Rico
You know what I'm sayin', Memphis in this mothafucka, biaaaaatch13Embed
