Big Bizness Lyrics
We gon' roast this fool

I'm breaking the law on this bitch ass
Broke ass nigga, that's talkin' that bullshit
Run across these hundred shots, trick, I'mma leave you wet
Thank you for your tapes I sold
Thanks for buying my Ox and Vogues
You're welcome to this bullet, hoe
I owe you somethin'? You smoking that dope
Triple Six don't love your ass
You’ll never know who was under the mask
From when I blast, point at your back
Once it’s full, I spit on yo ass
Buckin' em down, runnin', ya cocksucka will not save you
Free rappin', money lackin', while I’m stackin' (Fuck you!)
DJ Paul (Killaman)
Big boy thangs (When I hang)
G.B. (Broke mane)
Triple Six (Havin' thangs)
Smoke of a killa to shield the bud
You know it’s down, I show you no love
None forgivin' him, none of the above
Lucifer telling me “tear up tha club up”
Murderer, servin' a - nigga that’s known as Prophessor
I heard he tried to diss you, Paul
I cocked my Glock and said “What?”
You got more miles on your feet than I got on my Chevy
You slippin up, probably beggin' for them paybacks
Man, you so down
It’s big bizness, it’s big bizness, bitch
It’s big bizness, it’s big bizness, bitch
It’s big bizness, it’s big bizness, bitch
It’s big bizness, it’s big bizness, bitch
It’s big bizness, it’s big bizness, bitch
It’s big bizness, it’s big bizness, bitch
It’s big bizness, it’s big bizness, bitch
It’s big bizness, it’s big bizness, bitch
Killa, killa, killa
Murderer, murderer, murderer
Killa, killa, killa
Murderer, murderer, murderer
Killa, killa, killa
Murderer, murderer, murderer

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mane, fuck that shit, mane
Screw that shit for all my niggas in Texas, mane
You know what i'm sayin', know what i'm sayin'
We finna get higher than a muthafucka in this bitch, mane
Smoke -
Smoked out and fried
Yeah, slipped out up in this bi'r'ch
Haha
Hahaha
Killa, killa, killa
Murderer, murderer, murderer
Killa, killa, killa
Murderer, murderer, murderer
Killa, killa, killa
Murderer, murderer, murderer
Killa, killa, killa
Murderer, murderer, murderer
Killa, killa, killa
Murderer, murderer, murderer
