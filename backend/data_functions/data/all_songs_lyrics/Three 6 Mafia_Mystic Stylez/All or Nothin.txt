All or Nothin Lyrics
Gotta have a big back bank account not pity amounts
Bud by the pound smoke a mothafuckin' ounce
A mean ass crib, all digital studio
And some down ass hoes for the road
I want it all or nothin'
I want it all or nothin'

They bitches with a punch bowl of weed, I call it bud in bed
On the spread, plenty cash, dumpin' blunt ashes on they ass
A bed with hydraulics, liquor cause I'm alcoholic
No college for my knowledge, cause I knew how to make profits
Don't like expensive clothes, just the gangsta apparel
Grab my route foul as I walk down the threshold
Black as a shadow, smoke loc vehicle
Hit Triple six up on my Motorola portable
Keepin' it key low pro flow in the studio
Part time gigalo, rock a show to make some dough
Lord Infamous, Mafioso gangsta pimp playa
Got on my brand new Scarecrow underwear
Six hundred acre marijuana field in my backyard
Smokin' banana leaves on my lawn chair playa
Cause a room full of mothafuckin' bombs and artillery
All fuckin' century I need
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
I want it all or nothin'

Back in the days I was broke, no joke
Fucked up in town, no g's no hope
A nigga used to hike home from school on the bike trail
Wishin' one day this rap shit'll probably make me bail
Lil' ??? was the niggas I used to hang with
Andre and Big Trese North Memphis bound bitch
Hangin' on Evergreen corners holdin' my fuckin' nuts
Watchin' freaks walk by sayin' "dirty bitch wassup"
But they wasn't goin' cause they want a nigga sellin' yam
A mean four way with the grain wood his ass in
95.0 chevy thang with the vogues
But I used to catch the bus and lounge and the china store
I just couldn't wait tryin' to rap to get my final break
Juicy J AKA The Juice I want it on my tape
Sell and make money so the niggas in my hood'll know
Any one wanna ride I'll be singin' this chorus
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
I want it all or nothin'

In the nine-five I decided fuck this underground tape shit
Stack some cheese so quit puts on my disses tryin' to break bitch
Kinda quick kinda fast to a bigger studio
Bullshit producers tryin' to fuck me up my asshole
Tradin' ass niggas sayin' they do this and that for me
If you ain't for real then keep it to yourself
Cause see I ain't got time plus ain't in a mood for playin no fuckin' games
You cross me somethin and I dont get it I gotta lay it down
But I ain't and I'm not nigga I gotta make more than I did in the 9
For whatever it takes it won't be easy cause in they never why
In dough it better stay like this or get greater
Cause if a nigga fuck me now, I promise he pay for it later
That's why I beat you to my game and I learned the business
Cause you will straight be missin' without a witness
I want a pound of weed and a candy face in the den
A bank account readin' a mill and a 95 Benz
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
Plenty money and dope
A lot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
I want it all or nothin'
I want it all or nothin'
I want it all or nothin'
I want it all or nothin'Embed
