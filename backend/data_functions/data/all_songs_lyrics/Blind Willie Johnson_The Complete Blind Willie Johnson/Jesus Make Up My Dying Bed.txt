Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed LyricsSince me and Jesus got married
Haven't been a minute apart
With the receiver in my hand
And religion in my heart
I can ring'm up easy
Ahh
Oh well
Ring'm up easy
Go make up my
Mmm
Weeping that he ain't lost
Late Friday evening
Hanging on the cross
Hanging there in misery
Ahh
Oh well
Hanging there in misery
Go make up my
Mmm
Mmm mmm
Jesus gon' make up my
Late'n Friday evening
Made poor Martha moan
Jesus said to his disciples
Come and carry my mother home
Dying will be easy
Ahh
Dying will be easy
Dying will be easy
Jesus gon' make up my
I'm dead and buried
Somebody said that I was lost
When it get down to Jordan
Have the ferryman guide it across
Done gone over
Ahh
Oh well
Done gone over
Make up myEmbed
