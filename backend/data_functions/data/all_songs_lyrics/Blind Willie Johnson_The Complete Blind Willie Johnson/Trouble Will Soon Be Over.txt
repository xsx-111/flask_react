Trouble Will Soon Be Over LyricsOh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
Well, Christ is my burden bearer, He's my only friend
Till the end of my sorrow and tells me to lean on Him
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
God is my strong protection, He's my bosom friend
Trouble arose all around me, I know who will take me in
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
He proved a friend to David, and hid him in a cage
The same God that David served, will give me a rest someday
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
Well, though my burden may be heavy, my enemies crush me down
Someday I'll rest with Jesus and wear a starry crown
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
I'll take this yoke upon me and live a Christian life
Take Jesus for my Savior, my burden will be light
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
He proved a friend to David, and hid him in a cage
The same God that David served, will give me a rest someday
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an end
Oh, trouble'll soon be over, sorrow will have an endEmbed
