Take Your Stand LyricsTake a stand, take a stand, take a stand
If I never never see you anymore
Take a stand, take a stand, take a stand
I'll meet you on the kingdom's door
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
If I never never see you anymore
If I may, pray for me, pray for me
I'll meet you on the kingdom's door
Shake my hand, shake my hand, shake my hand
If I never never see you anymore
Shake my hand, shake my hand, shake my hand
I'll meet you on the kingdom's door
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
If I never never see you anymore
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
I'll meet you on the kingdom's door
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith
If I never never see you anymore
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith
I'll meet you on the kingdom's door
Take a stand, take a stand
If I never never see you anymore
Take a stand, take a stand, take a stand
I'll meet you on the kingdom's door
Praise the One, praise the One, praise the One
If I never never see you anymore
Praise the One, praise the One, praise the One
I'll meet you on the kingdom's door
Run the race, run the race, run the race
If I never never see you anymore
Run the race, run the race, run the race
I'll meet you on the kingdom's door
Take a stand, take a stand
If I never never see you anymore
Take a stand, take a stand, take a stand
I'll meet you on the kingdom's door
Grab my hand, grab my hand, grab my hand
If I never never see you anymore
Grab my hand, grab my hand, grab my hand
I'll meet you on the kingdom's doorEmbed
