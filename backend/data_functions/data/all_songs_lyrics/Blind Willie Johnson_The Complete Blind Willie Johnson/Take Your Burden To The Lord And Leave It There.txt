Take Your Burden To The Lord And Leave It There Lyrics
Oh leave it there
Oh leave it there
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there, oh leave it there
If you trust and never doubt, he will surely bring you out
Well, take your burden to the Lord and leave it there

If this world from you withhold of its silver and its gold
And you have to get along meagre fare, meagre fare
Just remember in his words how he feeds his little birds
Take your burden to the lord and leave it there

Leave it there
Oh leave it there
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there, oh leave it there
If you'll trust and never doubt, well he will surely bring you out
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there

If your body suffer pain and your health you can't regain
And your soul is almost sinking in despair, well in despair
Jesus knows the pains you feel, he can save and he can heal
Take your burden to the lord and leave it there
Leave it there
Oh leave it there
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there, oh leave it there
If you'll trust and never doubt, he will surely bring you out
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there

If your enemies assail and your heart begin to fail
Don't forget god in heaven answer prayer, answer prayer
He will make a way for you, then he'll lead you safely through
Take your burden to the lord and leave it there

Leave it there
Oh leave it there
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there, oh leave it there
If you'll trust and never doubt, he will surely bring you out
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it thereEmbed
