Go To Me With That Land Lyrics
Come and go with me, to that land
Come and go with me, to that land
Come and go with me, to that land
Where I'm bound
Come and go with me, to that land
Oh, come and go with me, to that land
Come and go with me, to that land
Where I'm bound
Oh, we'll see Jesus, in that land
Oh, we'll see Jesus, in that land
Oh, we'll see Jesus, in that land
Where I'm bound
We'll see Jesus, in that land
We'll see Jesus, oh, in that land
Oh, we'll see Jesus, in that land
Where I'm bound
There'll be no dying, in that land
There'll be no dying, oh, in that land
There'll be no dying, oh, in that land
Where I'm bound
There'll be no dying, in that land
There'll be no dying, oh, in that land
There'll be no dying, oh, in that land
Where I'm bound

Oh, don't you want to go, to that land
Don't you want to go, to that land
Don't you want to go, to that land
Where I'm bound
Oh, don't you want to go, to that land
Don't you want to go, to that land
Don't you want to go, to that land
Where I'm bound
We all'll be holy, in that land
We all'll be holy, in that land
We all'll be holy, in that land
Where I'm bound
We all'll be holy, in that land
We all'll be holy, in that land
We all'll be holy, in that land
Where I'm boundEmbed
