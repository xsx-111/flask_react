Let Your Light Shine On Me Lyrics
Let it shine on me, let it shine on me
Oh, let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Let it shine on me, let it shine on me
Oh, let Your light from the lighthouse shine on

My Lord, he's done just what he said
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Heal the sick and rise the dead
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on...

Oh, let it shine on, well, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on, oh, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on...

I know I've got religion and I ain't ashamed
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Angels in Heaven, done wrote my name
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on...

Oh, let it shine on, oh, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on well, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on...
Oh, let it shine on, oh, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on well, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me

Shine on, oh, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on, oh, let it shine on
Let Your light shine on meEmbed
