God Moves On The Water LyricsAh, Lord
Ah, Lord
Year of nineteen hundred and twelve
April the fourteenth day
Great Titanic struck an iceberg
People had to run and pray
God moves, moves, God moves, ah
And the people had to run and pray
The guards who had been a-watching
Asleep 'cause they were tired
When they heard the great excitement
Then a gunshot was fired
God moves, moves, God moves, ah
And the people had to run and pray
Captain Smith gave orders
Women and children first
Many of the lifeboats piled right up
Many were liable to crush
God moves on, God moves, God moves, ah
And the people had to run and pray
Ahh-ah
So many had to leave their happy home
All that they possess
Lord Jesus, will you hear us now
Help us in our distress
God moves, God moves, God moves, ah
People had to run and pray
Women had to leave their loving ones
See 'bout their safety
When they heard the liner was doomed
Hearts did almost break
God moves, God moves, God moves, ah
And the people had to run and pray
A.G. Smith, mighty man, built a boat
That he couldn't understand
Named it a name of God in a tin
Without a C, Lord, he pulled it in
God moves, ah, God moves, God moves, ah
And the people had to run and pray
Well
Ahh, ah, LordEmbed
