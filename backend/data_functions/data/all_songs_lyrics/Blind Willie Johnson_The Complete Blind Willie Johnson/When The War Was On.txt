When The War Was On Lyrics
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Well they registered everybody, when the war was on

Well, just about a few years, and some months ago
United States come, and voted for war
Sammy called a man from the East and the West
Get ready boys, we got to do our best

Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Well they registered everybody, when the war was on

Well, with president Wilson sittin' on the throne
Making loss for everyone
Didn't call the black man to lay by the white

Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Well they registered everybody, when the war was on
Ice on the landing, getting to 
Getting no better but the same old thing
Cents on the dollar, ride the train
Rates getting cheaper, take a ride again

Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Well they registered everybody, when the war was on

Measure your boiler, measure your wheat
Half a pound of sugar for a person a week
Folks didn't like it, they blamed uncle sam
Have got to save the sugar for the poor in'a France

Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Well they registered everybody, when the war was on

Well, boys whooped the Germans, home at last
Woulda' brought the kaiser but they run too fast
Coulden't blame the kaiser for'a leaving the land
Uncle Sammy had to save the skin'a most evil man
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Well they registered everybody, when the war was on

Tax getting heavy, time to pay
Half the boys all across the sea
Blood and water up to their knees
Faced the kaiser for'a you and me

Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Everybody wailed (when the war was on)
Well they registered everybody, when the war was onEmbed
