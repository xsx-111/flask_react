Motherless Children LyricsWell, well, well, ah
A motherless children have a hard time
Motherless children have a hard time, mother's dead
They'll not have anywhere to go, wanderin' around from door to door
Have a hard time
Nobody on earth can take a mother's place when, when mother is dead, Lord
Nobody on earth take mother's place when, mother's dead
Nobody on earth takes mother's place
When you were startin' paved the way
Nobody treats you like mother will when
Your wife or husband may be good to you, when mother is dead, Lord
They'll be good to you, mother's dead
A wife or a husband may be good to you
But, better than nothing has proved untrue
Nobody treats you like mother will when, when mother is dead, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Yeah, well, ah
Well, some people say that sister will do, when mother is dead
That sister will do when mother's dead
Some people say that sister will do
But, as soon as she's married, she'll turn her back on you
Nobody treats you like mother will
And father will do the best he can, when mother is dead, Lord
Well, the best he can when mother is dead
Father will do the best he can
So many things a father can't understand
Nobody treats you like mother will
Ahh,motherless children have a hard time, when mother is dead, Lord
Motherless children have a hard time, mother's dead
They'll not have anywhere to go
Wanderin' around from door to door
Have a hard timeEmbed
