Soul Of A Man Lyrics
Well, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
'Want somebody tell me, just what is the soul of a man?
I'm going to ask the question, answer if you can
If anybody surely can tell me, what is the soul of a man?

Well, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
I Want somebody tell me, just what is the soul of a man?
I've traveled in different countries, I've traveled in foreign lands
I've found nobody could tell me, just what about the soul of a man

Well, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
I Want somebody tell me, just what is the soul of a man?
I saw a crowd stand talking, I came up in time
Were teaching the lawyers,  the doctors, that a man ain't nothing but his mind
 x2
Well, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
I Want somebody tell me, just what is the soul of a man?
I reads the bible often, I tries to read it right
As far as I could understand, a man is more than his mind

God, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
I Want somebody tell me, just what is the soul of a man?
When Christ stood in the temple, the people all stood amazed
Was teaching the lawyers and the doctors, how to raise a body from the grave
 x2
Well, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
'Want somebody tell me, just what is the soul of a man?1Embed
