If It Had Not Been for Jesus Lyrics
If it had not been for Jesus
I would not have been here tonight
But here He has fully saved me
And he washed my black heart white

One night I went to the meeting
Just to hear them sing and show
But then I got salvation
And I found 

If it had not been for Jesus
I would not have been here tonight
But He has fully saved me
And he washed my black heart white

Oh, listen to me, oh, sinner
I'll tell you just what to do
Surrender all to Jesus
And He will save you too

If it had not been for Jesus
I would not have been here tonight
But He has fully saved me
And he washed my black heart white
Oh once I was a deep down sinner
Just as vile as I could be
I was on my way to destruction
And a deep down misery

If it had not been for Jesus
I would not have been here tonight
But He has fully saved me
And he washed my black heart white

One night I went to the meeting
Just to hear them sing and show
But then I got salvation
And I found 

If it had not been for Jesus
I would not have been here tonight
But He has fully saved me
And he washed my black heart whiteEmbed
