The Best Things Lyrics
Got a green light, got a green light, yeah
But I'm going nowhere
Got a green light, got a red light, yeah
No cop, no stop, I don't care
Every one of you could be the same
Every one of you could play the game
Got a green light, got a green light, yeah
But you're going nowhere

You know the best things in life aren't for me
You know the best things in life aren't for free

Got a new life, got a new plight, yeah
And it's going nowhere
Got a mountaintop like a pin drop
Got no God, no thought, I don't care
Every one of you could be the same
Every one of you can play this game
Got a new life, got a new plight, yeah
And it's going nowhere

You know the best things in life aren't for me
You know the best things in life aren't for free
Got a new find, got a new crime, yeah
And it's going nowhere
Like a global path, like a car crash, yeah
No cop, no stop, he don't care
Every one of you are just the same
Every one of you will play this game
Got a new find, got a new crime, yeah
And it's going nowhere

You know the best things in life aren't for me
You know the best things in life aren't for free
You know the best things in life aren't for me
You know the best things in life aren't for free
You know the best things in life aren't for me
You know the best things in life aren't for free
You know the best things in life aren't for me
You know the best things in life aren't for freeEmbed
