Miss Blue Lyrics
Could you stay long enough
For me to say goodbye?
You can be free
As long as you're with me
If you could see
The real me, you'd bleed
If you could see
The real me, I'd breathe
Could you still breathe
Long enough for me?
Could you still be
Long enough for me?

When do you think I'll be okay?
When do you think I'll be okay?

If I should stay, when do I pray?
If I should stay, where do I begin?
Do you think I should watch you die?
Should we close our eyes and say goodbye?

When do you think that I'll be okay?
When do you think we'll be okay?
Hey you, Miss Blue
You think that I'm well to do
Hey you, Miss Blue
I fell in love with you
Hey you, Miss Blue
I think about you, it's true
Hey you, Miss Blue
I hate it when you cry
Hey you, Miss Blue
I hate it when you say goodbye
Hey you, Miss Blue
I hate it when you say goodbye

When do you think that I'll be okay?
When do you think we'll be okay?

(I'll be okay)
When do you think that I'll be okay?
(When do you think I'll be okay?)
When do you think that I'll be okay?
(I'll be okay)
(Hey you, Miss Blue)
You say goodbye
(When do you think I'll be okay?)
(I'll be okay)
You say goodbye yeah
(When do you think I'll be okay?)
(Hey you, Miss Blue)
Don't say goodbye
Say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
GoodbyeEmbed
