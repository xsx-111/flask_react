Cancer Lyrics
I cross the oceans
I cross the seas
I cross the mountains
Like a new disease
I cross the borders
I cross the line
Never to see the light
Until the end of time

I've seen the canyons
I've seen the cities
I've seen the prisons
That take such pity
When it comes to you
When it comes to me
It's just money
That sets you free

(Hey, my children)
What seems important won't last forever
(Hey, my children)
What seems important won't last forever
Take a look at the Earth
From a plane
You'll see the Earth
Cut up and in pain
Take a look at LA
From the sky
What you see
Should make you cry

(Hey, my children)
What seems important won't last forever
(Hey, my children)
What seems important won't last forever

I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the scum of the earth
I am a cancer
(I'm the scum of the Earth)
I am a cancer
(I'm the scum of the Earth)
I am a cancer
(I'm the scum of the Earth)
I am a cancer
(I'm the scum of the Earth)
I am humanity
(I'm the scum of the Earth)
I am humanity
(I'm the scum of the Earth)
I am humanity
(I'm the scum of the Earth)
I am humanity
(Hey, my children)
What seems important won't last forever
(Hey, my children)
What seems important won't last forever
(Hey, my children)
What seems important won't last forever
(Hey, my children)
What seems important won't last forever2Embed
