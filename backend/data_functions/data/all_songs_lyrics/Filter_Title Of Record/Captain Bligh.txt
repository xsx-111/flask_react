Captain Bligh Lyrics
I'll give you one good tiny reason
I think you could believe it
I'll give you one good tiny reason
I think you could see through it
I'm not the kind of man
That thinks the truth could hurt me
I'm not the kind of man
That thinks the truth can see me
You know a little bit goes a long way
(You know a little bit lasts a long time)

And the time has come
To undo the wrong I've done

I am a grieving man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a guilty man
I can't believe the things I've done to you

I give you one good tiny reason
To push that big suit too far
I give you one good tiny reason
To smash him and his big car
Everybody thinks I'm blue
And what everybody think is true, yeah
And I just can't keep it inside
So you think it's you
So you think it's true
You know a little bit lasts a long time
(You know a little bit goes a long way)
And the time has come
To undo the wrong I've done

And I am a grieving man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a beaten man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
Yeah

And I am a blood-soaked man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
And I am a guilty man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
And I am a grieving man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a beaten man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
Yeah
Oh yeah

I tried to pray
I tried to pray
I tried to pray
Yes, I will give it a shot
Yes, I will give it a shot
Yes, I will give it a shot
Shot
