Welcome to the Fold Lyrics
You take my money
You think you're great
You think it's funny
And I hate your face
You got your Jesus
And I got my space
You got your reasons
And I got my case

Just gotta sit yourself down
To contemplate
You get yourself a nice cold beer
And drink yourself away
You're celebrating nothing
And you feel a-okay
You're celebrating nothing
And you feel a-okay

You think you're precious
And I think you're shit
And I'd kill your father
To destroy his seed
Oh, nothing will ever
Destroy your greed
You just gotta sit yourself down
To contemplate
Get yourself a nice cold beer
And drink yourself away
You're celebrating nothing
And you feel a-okay
You're celebrating nothing
And you feel a-okay

Now when you break yourself down
Go to this place
You give yourself the reason
To get off your case
And when you break it down, yeah
See through this shit
You give yourself the reason
To live though this

Mama, give me my medicine
Mama, give me my medicine
Mama, give me my medicine
The one that makes me feel taller
Mama, give me my medicine
Mama, give me my medicine
One that makes me feel so tall
Tall, like a tall tree
Mama, give me my medicine
That makes me feel like a tall tree
Mama, give me my medicine
That makes me feel like a tall tree
Mama, give me my medicine
That makes me feel like a tall tree, yeah
You're celebrating nothing
And you feel a-okay
You're celebrating nothing
And you feel a-okay8Embed
