Perpetual Change LyricsI see the cold mist in the night
And watch the hills roll out of sight
I watch in every single way
Inside out, outside in
Every day
The sun can warm the coldest dawn
And move the movement on the lawn
I learn in every single day
Inside out, outside in
Every way
And there you are
Making it up that you're sure that it is a star
When all you see
Is an illusion shining down in front of me
And then you say
Even in time we shall control the day
When what you see
Deep inside the day's controlling you and me
And one peculiar point I see
As one with many ones of me
As truth is gathered, I rearrange
Inside out, outside in
Inside out, outside in
Perpetual change
And there you are
Saying we have the moon, so now the stars
When all you see
Is near disaster gazing down on you and me
And there you're standing
Saying we have the whole world in our hands
When all you see
Deep inside the world's controlling you and me
Who'll see perpetual change
You'll see perpetual change
And there you are
Making it up that you're sure that it is a star
When all you see
Is an illusion shining down in front of me
And then you say
Even in time we shall control the day
When all you see
Deep inside the day's controlling you and me
As mist and sun are both the same
We look on as pawns of their game
They move to testify the day
Inside out, outside in
Inside out, outside in
All of the wayEmbed
