Beneath, Between and Behind  LyricsTen score years ago
Defeat the kingly foe
A wondrous dream came into being
Tame the trackless waste
No virgin land left chaste
All shining eyes but never seeing
Beneath the noble bird
Between the proudest words
Behind the beauty, cracks appear
Once with heads held high
They sang out to the sky
Why do their shadows bow in fear
The guns replace the plow
Facades are tarnished now
The principles have been betrayed
The dream’s gone stale
But still let hope prevail
History’s debt won’t be repaid
Beneath the noble bird
Between the proudest words
Behind the beauty, cracks appear
Once with heads held high
They sang out to the sky
Why do their shadows bow in fearEmbed
