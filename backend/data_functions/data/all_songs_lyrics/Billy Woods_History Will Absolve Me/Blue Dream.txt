Blue Dream Lyrics
Haze in a dutch, across the room
At first I didn't think much
Highed-up and blazed, still recognize Dominican perfume
Naturelle Riviera octoroon sour candy
It was like cartoons, Pep√© Le Pew
It was like time didn't move for the count of one (one) two (two)
Then we're flying
I'm hoping you don't ask the wrong questions
I really don't want to start lying
In bed not sleeping, she teasing
Legs spread, mouth wet, seasonal fruit
Stuck in my head like the perfect loop
Slow burn smokey eyes, lotion thighs
Suddenly realizing you're alive
Like one day I'ma die but right now I'm alive
Smell you on my pillows, Blackberry Kush billows
People nosey like "is that your girl though?"
I'm like "chill chill, plenty other flowers I'm feeling still"
Fronting for real, like yeah, she bad but I need that killer kill
Truth is when she around it's ill how words spill
Or we don't have to say a thing just let that Blue sing

Where you going?
I hate you!
You selfish, you arrogant, and so stupid!
Yeah, whatever, man
Nigga, I don't need you to live here
I'm tired of sitting up in this house, not having a man next to me when I want
I'ma do what the fuck I wanna
You know you had me from the very start
And in my heart, I thought we'd never part
Hazy days mixed red and green
Purple nights off those Blue Dreams

So much unsaid
We only keep it real when we joking
Not getting high, still smoking
Somewhere along the line stopped trying to try and started going through the motions
That day-to-day got you on some "happy to see you after work, here's a kiss"
But by bedtime I got a headache that just won't quit
Even worse in the morning
If it ain't this it's that, if it ain't raining, it's pouring
Predictable and boring
Plus got me 'noided
It's getting annoying, all that effort nulled and voided
Zero sum game, if you're at home scoring
Blood pressure soaring
Maybe I shouldn't blame you but I do
Whatever, you blame me for all your shit too
Who knew, after all we been through
It would come down to this wack petty shit
When we met, we was just kids and even now that it's over
I would still hit!
You know you had me from the very start
And in my heart I thought we'd never part
Hazy days mixed red and green
Purple nights off those Blue Dreams
You know you had me from the very start
Purple nights off those Blue DreamsEmbed
