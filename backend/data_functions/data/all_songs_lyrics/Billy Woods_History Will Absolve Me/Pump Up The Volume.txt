Pump Up The Volume Lyrics
If we don't win by the ballot, it's back to the bush
Build an African Death Star out of callouses, children's swollen stomachs
Push into the Presidential Palace, big cigars ablaze
No need for the suitcase, we already dug the graves
And those pumps work like slaves (Chop chop)
So when we let the machetes coup de grace
200 million barrels a day was all we saw
One Monkey Don't Stop No Show (No way)
Back in business, see that pipeline? Now I control the flow
Let Switzerland hold the dough
Tel Aviv can grind anything we get out those mines
Get Washington on the satellite phone, promise a price freeze
Guarantee the safety of Royal Dutch Shell employees
Increase the Mobil/Exxon concession
And send our militias more weapons
Purge the unions, assassinate the students, but keep promising elections
I don't want to put on the BBC and see anything about repression

We fly by in bullet proof Benzes
Gucci aviators with the mirrored lenses
Sippin' champagne in the Seychelles
Living like this, boy it do get expensive
We fly by in bullet proof Benzes
Gucci aviators with the mirrored lenses
Sippin' champagne in the Seychelles
Living like this, boy it do get expensive
The village stands in the midst of such rapacious pillage
We live with murky rivers and oil spillage
Around here it's never dark, we live in the sparks
Perpetual gas flares look like rustin' Olympic torches
Black Gold medalists on derrick platforms surrounded by armed forces
Last thing we need is another daughter
Don't drink the water, don't breath the air
Don't talk to any reporters' tape recorders
Special Forces the only ones with cold beer and fresh vegetables
Knocking late at night, cold fear grips your testicles
They pushin' in asking for you, her and him
They got lots of questions about what you were doing with them
And who told who what, when

We fly by in bullet proof Benzes
Gucci aviators with the mirrored lenses
Sippin' champagne in the Seychelles
Living like this, boy it do get expensive
We fly by in bullet proof Benzes
Gucci aviators with the mirrored lenses
Sippin' champagne in the Seychelles
Living like this, boy it do get expensiveEmbed
