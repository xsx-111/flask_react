Famous Last Words Lyrics
When them other niggas jumped ship, we kept it Amistad
Still ended up in front a white judge, praying to God
I owe much, have nothing, leave the rest to the poor
Vegetation lush, Dutch Candy, New York Giants at the door
On some Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum your electric bill is quite the sum
Smile. Light the blunt
Last moment in the spotlight, it's only right you should stunt
Get bonded out, put up that brave front
Mom's put up the house, so you know you can't run
Cracks start to show, weeks turn to months
Lawyer says they want time, DA is a cunt
Reality won't hit till you up in them bunks
With cats that's gassed cause it's Hamburger Helper for lunch
Face bashed, CO's knuckles usually chuckle last
Mention the past, all you'll get is a Woody Woodpecker laugh

Exchanging mary jane and bad words
Can't believe this lame brain even had the nerve
Make me squeeze the flame
And leave ya name pon da curb
Another brother slain from his famous last words
The say that my wrath and my actions disturbed
Madness occurred but my past is a blur
Laugh at the aftermath of accidents and worst
The first shall be last
And the last shall be first
Cursed
On the bubble
Think they cooking crack in ginger ale
These niggas gay rocking tight jeans and fingerwaves
They bring a knife to a gunfight
I bring grenades
Get on some Daniel Boone shit
And skin ya face
Hit ya man point blank range you catch a stray
A likkle ricochet may
Hit him, blick 'em, lick 'em
Leave 'em leakin' in the paint
I'm getting paid for slangin' blades
Y'all Kid 'n Play an only call me monster
Cause you been afraid
Gatorade can't quench this thirst
When you see ya family approach the bench it hurts
'Specially when they contradict ya words
In the church, bullets burst, get ya limbs dispersed
Listen jerk, I ain't no slave for prison work
Inject ya earth but you the one there when she givin' birth
Apartheid rhymes, no Mandela with de Klerk
I eat ya face
I eat ya food
And then I get dessert
Word!
Exchanging mary jane and bad words
Can't believe this lame brain even had the nerve
Make me squeeze the flame
And leave ya name pon da curb
Another brother slain from his famous last words
The say that my wrath and my actions disturbed
Madness occurred but my past is a blur
Laugh at the aftermath of accidents and worst
The first shall be last
And the last shall be first
Cursed

I'll settle for The Post, but ideally the Times
Tell 'em I said somethin', make sure it rhymes
Churchill with cigars, words to stiffen spines
Lists like Christmastime, you know I'm getting mines
Due diligence means your box is pine
Ground is soft, it'll be fine, body's going off
Brought a pound of quicklime, ounce of Strawberry Cough
That's air freshener for the Jetta
Put a beggar on horseback, he'll ride to hell
I ain't pay twenty bones to hear you spit a capell'
One is for the money, two is quid pro quo
Ripped the afterparty after he skipped the show
Force 'em to work together, hammer & sickle logo on the Polo
Ivory soap, Gold Medal Flour, desperate to blow
End up left for the crows
Mississippi Goddamn
Shoot coward, you are only gonna kill a man
Exchanging mary jane and bad words
Can't believe this lame brain even had the nerve
Make me squeeze the flame
And leave ya name pon da curb
Another brother slain from his famous last words
The say that my wrath and my actions disturbed
Madness occurred but my past is a blur
Laugh at the aftermath of accidents and worst
The first shall be last
And the last shall be first
CursedEmbed
