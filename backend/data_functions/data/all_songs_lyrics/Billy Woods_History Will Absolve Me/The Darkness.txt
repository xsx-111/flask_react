The Darkness Lyrics
Supposed to have my back but knife in my neck
No surprise really it was the nation who came for Brother X
Caesar on the steps Selassie while we slept
Huey P took three in the Acorn projects
You wouldn’t believe how the reptiles wept while gnawing your flesh
Reckless talk in the breeze, I wager they not a threat
But then again life or limb is a hell of a big bet
Double or nothing midnight in the garden
She left in a pumpkin, my expression didn’t change
Timothy Dunkin, gotta trust someone sometime for something
You probably think fam and friends will be think and thin
Better think again, for every ten when you win
You luck if it’s one or two that still come through
I get thanks and break bread, spliffs is hog leg
Jay woods smoke good the best is unsaid
Dread I’ve done bled, fought nail and tooth
Shared the last plate of food
I used to cop myself a dutch you aloof
Split the golden goose, no regrets
You can’t blame the youth
I signed my name with the red x

Rocking academic bib hoping I was born for music
Like art I was drawn to it, while some is cartoons
Statements of emotions with points is made sharp
As the harpoon, some is non-intelligent
Going in and out of relationships, like water for elephants
On elevators hella thick, spit massive, collapsing beat
Like an accordion, recordings and stereo optical
That’s audible unless void assessing me
New abilities to open up new levels like
Metroid, voyage on another plateau
Everybody either rap fast or rap slow
We rap dro minus that, my ninja spit classic quotes
Without an arm or neck flashy roads
Only float what is known opposed to those
Growing nose, but that’s already
Everybody tryna make dough like Betty
Knowing the road is heavy as the dome stairway
On my mom wishing I could fly in these difficult times
Rhyme getting through life, spent in a few lines
And zone in the maze, where they even tryna tame the grown
Everybody searching for family, similar to ways power is gained
And the game of thrones is a pain to most
And the game to those that maneuver with a lame approach
Gotta stay your woke, knowing every goal takes a toll
What a passion to grow, we spit collaborative flows
Snake slither sideways cider luck smile fake
I screw face, foul funks handshake leave foul taste
Friends yesterday now I look on in disgust
At the things niggas’ll do for a couple bucks
Used to play it off, now I’m like “y’all play too much”
Take, take, take, for these greedy niggas is never enough
Mouth full swollen gut talking ‘bout the sign these papers
Apostates is worse than haters, claim the flag but you a traitor
Wack albums we let you slide, when you sent them wack verses
Niggas wasn’t surprised, sullen legacy
Punchline garbage, spineless you spitting straight cotton
Twenty dollar videos mucking like you the hardest
Wanna do some hard shit, look in the mirror at a nigga
Who rather duck and dodge than pay with  you bitchEmbed
