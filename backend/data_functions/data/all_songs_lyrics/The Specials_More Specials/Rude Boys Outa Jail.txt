Rude Boys Outa Jail LyricsRude boy's outta jail
Rude boy's outta jail
Rude boy's out on bail
Rude boy's outta jail
They mess around in every town
But now they've learned the rules
They used to be rough, they used to be tough
But now they're keeping cool
They don't fight, they look just right
In their tonics and button downs
If you see them around, don't put them down
They're the coolest guys in town
Rude boy's outta jail
Rude boy's outta jail
Rude boy's out on bail
Rude boy's outta jail
They mess around in every town
But now they've learned the rules
They used to be rough, they used to be tough
But now they're keeping their coolEmbed
