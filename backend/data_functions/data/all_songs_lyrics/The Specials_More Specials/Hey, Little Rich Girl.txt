Hey, Little Rich Girl Lyrics
Mum bought you a fur coat
When you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco
But everyone was in jeans

But you were a rich girl
Only having fun
Your low cut dresses
Brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

You left for London
When you were nineteen
Had to pull off your nice clothes
Just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights
Took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom
For a fate unknown

But you were a rich girl
Hardly having fun
Your worn out dresses
Brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl
My words are in this song
Hey, little rich girl my love for you is gone
And now little rich girl
I know where you went wrong


At your dad's office party
All the movies were blue
Caused him so much heart ache
Because the screen star was you
You left for London
When you were nineteen
Had to pull off your nice clothes
But you were living on dreams

And you were a rich girl
And only having fun
But your worn out dresses
Brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?Embed
