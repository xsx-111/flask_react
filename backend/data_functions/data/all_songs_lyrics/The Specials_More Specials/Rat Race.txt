Rat Race LyricsYou're working at your leisure to learn the things you'll need
The promises you make tomorrow will carry no guarantee
I've seen your qualifications, you've got a Ph.D
I've got one art O level, it did nothing for me
Working for the rat race
You know you're wasting your time
Working for the rat race
You're no friend of mine
You plan your conversation to impress the college bar
Just talking about your mother and daddy's Jaguar
Wear your political t-shirt and sacred college scarf
Discussing the world's situation but just for a laugh
You'll be working for the rat race
You know you're wasting your time
Working for the rat race
You're no friend of mine
Working for the rat race
You know you're wasting your time
Working for the rat race
You're no friend of mine
Just working at your leisure to learn the things you won't need
The promises you make tomorrow will carry no guarantee
I've seen your qualifications, you've got a Ph.D
I've got an art O level, it did nothing for me
Working for the rat race
You know you're wasting your time
Working for the rat race
You're no friend of mineEmbed
