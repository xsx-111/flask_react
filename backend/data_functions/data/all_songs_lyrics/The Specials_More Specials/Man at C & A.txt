Man at C & A LyricsWarning, warning, nuclear attack
Atomic sounds designed to blow your mind
World War Three
Nuclear attack
Rocking atomically
This Third World War, atomic sounds
The man in black he told me the latest Moscow news
About the storm across the red sea they drove their ball point views
I'm the man in grey, I'm just the man at C & A
And I don't have a say in the war games that they play
Warning, warning, nuclear attack
Shark attack to hit you on your back
World War Three
The Mickey Mouse badge told, Ayatollah at his feet
You drink your oil you schmuck, we'll eat our heads of wheat
But I'm the man in grey, I'm just the man at C & A
And I don't have a say in the war games that they play
Boom shakalaka boom
Nuclear nuclear, nuclear war
Warning, warning, nuclear attack
The boom never ban
Shark attack!Embed
