Enjoy Yourself (Reprise) LyricsEnjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as you wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as you wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as you wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you thinkEmbed
