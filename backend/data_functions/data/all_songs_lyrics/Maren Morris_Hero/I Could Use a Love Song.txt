I Could Use a Love Song Lyrics
Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sittin' in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye and heart-to-heart
But maybe I'm just gettin' old
Used to work, but now it don't

A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don't know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need somethin' stronger
That'll last a little longer

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song
I wish I didn't know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn't workin'
But I haven't lost all hope yet
Yeah, it's hurtin', but it ain't dead

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just somethin' that I can believe in

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song2Embed
