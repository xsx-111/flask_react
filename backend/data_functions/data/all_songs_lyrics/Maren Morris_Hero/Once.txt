Once Lyrics
Darling, please, we were too gone to stay
Couldn't get through the night, so we had to call it a day
The words came out; they couldn't be erased
Saw the pain in your eyes, and I knew everything had changed

I'm a traitor, I'm the cause
I'm the breaker of your heart
I ain't saying what you want
But baby, please, know that if

Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once

It's been months; I'm still seeing signs of you
Things that you wanted me to read, shit that you wanted me to do
If I'm left in the deepest part of your mind, it's cool
Oh, it's cool

Yeah, it hurts, I agree
You're still the first part of me
I know I set you free
But baby, please, know that if
Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once

Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once
I know this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once2Embed
