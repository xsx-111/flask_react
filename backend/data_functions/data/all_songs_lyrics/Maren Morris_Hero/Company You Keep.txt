Company You Keep Lyrics
Everyone's always talkin' 'bout their favorite destination
Where they're gonna go on their next vacation
Gotta make that flashy reservation
Don't wanna wait in line
But when I'm sittin' on the couch and I'm lookin' at the pictures
The background's only a secondary fixture
Where we went for dinner, shoot, I don't remember
But we had a good time

Together, together
We can do whatever, whatever

We can walk right up the street
Where the locals roll
We ain't gotta go international
Baby, just drive in a park and party
We don't need no Hollywood suite
Ooh, don't matter what we do
Anything with you sounds fine to me
It's all about the company you keep
Yeah, 'bout the company you keep
So come on, keep me company
Ooh, listen

When it comes down to it, nobody really cares
Where you had your birthday, just who was there
Buy you a shot, then hold back your hair
Take you to Waffle House
We're the circles that you're runnin' when you're runnin' around
Bail you out, make you laugh, pick you up when you're down
Hangin' out in your hometown
Hey, that's what it's all about

Whatever, whatever
We're all in it together, birds of a feather

We can walk right up the street
Where the locals roll
We ain't gotta go international
Baby, just drive in a park and party
We don't need no Hollywood suite
Ooh, don't matter what we do
Anything with you sounds fine to me
It's all about the company you keep
Yeah, 'bout the company you keep
So come on, keep me company
We can walk right up the street
Where the locals roll
We ain't gotta go international
Baby, just drive in a park and party
We don't need no Hollywood suite
Ooh, don't matter what we do
Anything with you sounds fine to me
It's all about the company you keep
Yeah, 'bout the company you keep
So come on, keep me company

Whatever, we're all in it together, yeah
So come on, keep me company1Embed
