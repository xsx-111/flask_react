Second Wind Lyrics
Why do we build up all these idols just to watch 'em fall?
You're wearin' the crown, toast of the town
And no one takes your call

Yeah, maybe I've been down, down, down, down
But I always come back around, 'round, 'round, 'round, yeah

You can't forget about me
While you weren't lookin', I was gettin' even higher
Say what you want about me
Your words are gasoline on my fire
You can hate me, underestimate me
Do what you do, 'cause what you do don't phase me
Just when you think I'm at the end
Any second, I'ma catch my second wind
Na-na-na-na, na-na

An airplane's only paper 'til it finds a breeze
But don't you know that it's the low that makes the high so sweet?
When they try to break, break, break you
That's when you get your break-break-breakthrough, yeah
You can't forget about me
While you weren't lookin', I was gettin' even higher
Say what you want about me
Your words are gasoline on my fire
You can hate me, underestimate me
Do what you do, 'cause what you do don't phase me
Just when you think I'm at the end
Any second, I'ma catch my second wind
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na

Yeah, maybe I've been down, down, down, down
But I always come back around, 'round, 'round, 'round, yeah, yeah

You can't forget about me
While you weren't lookin', I was gettin' even higher
Say what you want about me
Your words are gasoline on my fire
You can hate me, underestimate me
Do what you do, 'cause what you do don't phase me
Just when you think I'm at the end
I'ma catch my second wind
Na-na-na-na, na-na
I'ma catch my, I'ma catch my (Na-na-na-na, na-na)
I'ma catch my, I'ma catch my second wind (Na-na-na-na, na-na)
(Na-na-na-na, na-na) Woo
(Na-na-na-na, na-na) Yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na1Embed
