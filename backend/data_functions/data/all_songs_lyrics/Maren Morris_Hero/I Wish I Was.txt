I Wish I Was Lyrics
On paper, we go together
I know that we look the part
But almost never hangs on forever
I know I'm breakin' your heart

So go on, say what you want to
I'm not gonna stop you
You can blame it all on me, mm

I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
'Cause you're lookin' for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Mm, I wish, oh, I wish I was
Mm-mm

Wish I could feel about ya
The way you feel about me
But you can't make a heart say somethin'
That it don't believe
So go on, hate me if you have to
I hate myself, too
'Cause as much as I wanna be

I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
'Cause you're lookin' for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Mm, I wish, oh, I wish I was

Go on, hate me if you have to
I still care about you
Mm, as much as I wanna be

I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
'Cause you're lookin' for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Oh, 'cause you're lookin' for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Mm, I wish, oh, I wish I was
Ooh-ooh-ooh, mm
Oh-oh-oh-oh3Embed
