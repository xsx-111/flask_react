Just Another Thing Lyrics
I oughta know better
But you know that never stopped me before
Yeah, my wheels just have a way of spinnin'
Always endin' back at your door, mm-mm

So add your name to the list
Of all the things I can't seem to kick

You're just another mess
Another late night call I shouldn't be makin'
Just another high
Another one night shot I shouldn't be chasin'
I got my excuses, no, I don't know why I do it, but
You're just another, just another thing
I shouldn't be doin' (Woah, oh)
Hell, I shouldn't be doin' (Woah, oh)

Just like smokin', just like drinkin'
I'm a fool for ever thinkin' I'm done
Mm-mm, yeah
I always break that promise
If I'm honest, it ain't ever just one
Or two, when I'm runnin' into you
I'm right back on that road
Pushin' that first domino

You're just another mess
Another late night call I shouldn't be makin'
Just another high
Another one night shot I shouldn't be chasin'
I got my excuses, no, I don't know why I do it, but
You're just another, just another thing
I shouldn't be doin', oh-oh (Woah, oh)
I shouldn't be doin' (Woah, oh)

Yeah, you're just another kiss
Another Friday night I shouldn't be wastin' (I shouldn't be wastin')
Just another "What you doin' later on?" I shouldn't be sayin'
I got my excuses, no, I don't know why I do it (Yeah)
You're just another, just another thing
I shouldn't be doin', oh-oh (Woah, oh)
Shouldn't be doin', no (Woah, oh)
Shouldn't be doin' (Woah, oh)
Shouldn't be doin' (Woah, oh)1Embed
