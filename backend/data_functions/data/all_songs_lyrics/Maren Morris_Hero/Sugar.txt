Sugar Lyrics
Boy, I've been cookin' up one hell of a crush
Got you on my mind the minute I wake up
You make the mornin' glow, make the rooster crow
Get my juices flowin'
You know I got the spice, but it ain't enough

Baby, would you be my sugar, sugar?
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on Christmas Day
You're what I crave, babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar? Oh, oh

Tried the fake shit, but it ain't the same
A girl just knows when it's the real thing
Yeah, I'm a cup of tea with a touch of cream
But something's missin'
So I'm gonna put this nice and sweet

Baby, would you be my sugar, sugar?
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on Christmas Day
You're what I crave, babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar? Oh, oh
Would you be my sugar, sugar? Oh, oh, oh
Sugar, sugar, you make my heart race
Even on a good day, you make the world taste
Better, better, good on anything
Just a little bit is all that it takes

Sugar, sugar
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on Christmas Day
You're what I crave, babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar? Oh, oh
Would you be my sugar, sugar? Oh, oh, oh
