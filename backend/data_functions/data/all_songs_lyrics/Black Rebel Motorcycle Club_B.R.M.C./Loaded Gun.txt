Loaded Gun LyricsThe lost generation's taking hold
The last generation keeping scores
Gonna wanna know who they're working for
You're gonna wanna know who you're working for
You're living like a loaded gun
You're living like a loaded gun
You're living like a loaded gun
You better show your hands
The lost generation's keeping score
The last generation taking holes
Gonna wanna know who they're working for
You're gonna wanna know who you're working for
You're living like a loaded gun
You're living like a loaded gun
You're living like a loaded gun
You better show your hands
You're living like a loaded gunEmbed
