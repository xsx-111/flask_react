Salvation LyricsSo Jesus left you lonely, feels like nothing's really holy
No one, no one hears your calling, falling, everything is falling
Do you feel alive? Can you feel alive?
Do you feel alive? Can you feel alive?
So Jesus left you lonely, feels like nothing's really holy
No one, no one hears your calling, falling, everything is falling
Do you feel alive? Can you feel alive?
Do you feel alive? Can you feel alive?
Try so hard just to speak to you, nothing ever seems to come through
Circumstances on the breaking back, trying to sit down is a therapy
Oh, salvation, oh, salvation, oh, salvation, oh, salvation
Do you feel alive? Can you feel alive?
Do you feel alive? Can you feel alive?
Do you feel alive? Can you feel alive?
Do you feel alive? Can you feel alive?1Embed
