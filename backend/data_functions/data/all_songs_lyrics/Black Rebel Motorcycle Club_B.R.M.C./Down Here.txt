Down Here LyricsTake your lonesome soul to the place
I hear where your freedom comes and nobody cares
Lead your woes away they're only here if you stay down here
Down here they say there's a game to play
There's a place to go where you learn how to pray
No one seems to care but they'll give you a stare down here
They're gonna steal your breath
So give it away
They're gonna steal your mind
So give it away
They're gonna steal your soul so give it away
Down hereEmbed
