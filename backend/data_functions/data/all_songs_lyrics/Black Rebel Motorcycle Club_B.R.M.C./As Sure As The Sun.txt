As Sure As The Sun LyricsSo now that everybody's gone
You see no change has come
In every song you've ever sung
You find the words were wrong
But now the time is gonna come
And there's no feeling lost
For everyone who could've loved
But maybe not enough
And all the time
I thought your words were mine
You held me down
As sure as the sun
You held me down
As sure as the sun
Now I could see into your eyes
But there's no compromise
For anyone you could've saved
But never recognized
And now your world is gonna fall
But I won't help at all
For everyone who sees their place
Who knows they can't belong
And all the time
I thought your words were mine
You held me down
As sure as the sun
You held me down
As sure as the sun
You've taken away
Much more than you gave
What keeps me down
I'm lost in a rage
No one can explain
What keeps me down
What keeps you down
So now that everybody's gone
You see no change has come
In every song you've ever sung
You find the words were wrong
And every paper that you read
You feel your spirit grieve
For everyone who's gonna fall
Their distance never leaves
But all the time
I thought your words were mine
You held me down
As sure as the sun
And all the time
I thought your words were mine
You held me down
As sure as the sun
You held me down
As sure as the sun
You've taken away
Much more than you gave
What keeps me down
I'm lost in a rage
No one can explain
What keeps me down
What keeps you downEmbed
