White Palms LyricsJesus when you coming back? Jesus never coming back
Jesus won't take me back, Jesus never coming home
Jesus seemed to steal my soul, He'll never let me go
Jesus gonna make me pay, never should have run away, I wanna go home
Jesus when you going to come back?
Jesus when you going come back?
Jesus I dare you to come back
Jesus when you going to come back home?
The devil seems to climb inside, walk in through my open eyes
Never shoulda ever shown and he's all I've ever known
Jesus when you coming back? He's never coming back
You'll never take me back, we're never going home, I wanna go home
Jesus when you going to come back?
Jesus when you going come back?
Jesus I dare you to come back
Jesus when you going to come back home?
Jesus when you coming back? Jesus never coming back
Jesus won't take me back, Jesus never coming home
Jesus seemed to steal my soul, He'll never let me go
Jesus gonna make me pay, never should have run away, I wanna go home
Jesus when you going to come back?
Jesus I dare you to come back
Jesus I beg you to come back
Jesus when you going to come back home?
I wouldn't come back if I'd have been Jesus
I'm the kinda guy who leaves the scene of the crime
I wouldn't come back if I'd have been Jesus
I'm the kinda guy who leaves the scene of the crime
I wouldn't come back if I'd have been Jesus...Embed
