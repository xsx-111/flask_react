Red Eyes And Tears LyricsRed eyes and tears, no more for you my love I fear
Red eyes and tears, no more for you my love I fear
No more fear, no more fear, I'm in love
I'm losing sensation for you my love I fear
I'm losing sensation for you my love I fear
No more fear, no more fear, I'm in love
I'm in love, love, I'm in love
I'm losing the reasons to breathe, I never lived
I'm losing the reasons to breathe, I never lived
Never lived, never lived, I'm in love
These are my reasons, the truth is never filled
These are my reasons, the truth is never filled
I'm never filled, never filled, I'm in love
I'm in love, love, I'm in love
Red eyes and tears, no more for you my love I kill
Red eyes and tears, no more for you my love I kill
Red eyes and tears, red eyes and tears
Red eyes and tears, no more for you my love I kill
No more kill, no more kill, I'm in love
I'm in love, love, I'm in loveEmbed
