Screaming Gun LyricsWell, you run from your reasons as you slip on your soul
Now you're keeping a hold of something you've never known
You're tied in your mind, hangin' lifeless inside, yeah
You're dyin' alone, you should've known it'd be cold, yeah
Cold, yeah
Cold, yeah
Now you know you're alone
You're a screaming gun, yeah
Gun, yeah
Gun, yeah
Gun, yeah
Well, you hold down the silence with an anger below
You scream for your purpose as you're lettin' it go
Now all that you hold is what's left of your soul
But what's left of your soul you can't keep a hold of no soul, yeah
Soul, yeah
Now you know you're alone
You're a screaming gun, yeah
Gun, yeah
Gun, yeah
Gun, yeah
Well, you run from your reasons as you slip on your soul
Now you're keeping a hold of something you've never known
Yeah you're tied in your mind, hangin' lifeless inside, yeah
You're dyin' alone, you should've known it'd be cold, yeah
Cold, yeah
Cold, yeah
Now you know you're alone
You're a screaming gun, yeah
Gun, yeah
Gun, yeah
Gun, yeahEmbed
