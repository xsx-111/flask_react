Head Up High LyricsYou feel, no one listens, they're forcing you through
You fear, nothing takes you as far as you'll go
This song is not about you but the life that stands without you
Your body and blood, your body and blood, you're leaving us all
I keep my head up high to ease my mind of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind of all these true sensations
You feel, nothing ever stays the same as it was
You'll take, no more remedies to force yourself true
You say, every motion and thought fail you, too
This song is not about you but the life that stands without you
Your body and blood, your body and blood, you're leaving us all
I keep my head up high to ease my mind of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind of all these true sensationsEmbed
