Love Burns Lyrics
Never thought I'd see her go away, she learned I loved her today
Never thought I'd see her cry, and I learned how to love her today
Never thought I'd rather die than try to keep her by my side

Now she's gone, love burns inside me
Now she's gone, love burns inside me
Now she's gone, love burns inside me

Nothing else can hurt us now, no loss our love's been hung on a cross
Nothing seems to make a sound and now it's all so clear somehow
Nothing really matters now, we're gone and on our way

Now she's gone, love burns inside me
Now she's gone, love burns inside me
Now she's gone, love burns inside me

She cuts my skin and bruise my lips, she's everything to me
She tears my clothes and burns my eyes, she's all I wanna see
She brings the cold and scars my soul, she's heaven sent to me

Now she’s gone, love burns inside me
Now she’s gone, love burns inside me
Now she’s gone, love burns inside me
Never thought I’d leave you like the way I do, yeah
Kiss my love and I wish you’re gone
You can kiss my love and I wish you’re gone
Never thought I’d leave you like the way that I do
Kiss my love and I wish you’re gone
You can kiss my love and I wish you’re gone
Now she’s gone love burns inside me
Now she’s gone love burns inside me1Embed
