Awake LyricsWant to feel what I touch
Want to find what was lost
Want to be kind
As you see every curse
And in a dream it'll work
Now you'll feel tied
Want to praise with this life
And conceal without lies
I just need time
Want to fight every need
Every push every string
Will you stand by?
I've been awake through the wrong decisions
I've held the ground now I'm gaining soul
I bit my tongue through the cold realizations
I've been accused but I've only begun
Want to speak what I've seen
Want to reach what I've dreamed
Want to be kind
Want to seal what I've cut
Want to hear without rush
Want to ease time
With your hand on your loss
Our scene truly cost
No one told you
And we grew from the day
Into night I'm ashamed
I will join you
I've been awake through the wrong decisions
I've held my ground now I'm gaining soul
I bit my tongue through the cold realizations
I've been accused, but I've only begun
Take me on, take me on
I've been awake, shaking to a rage
I've been awake, shaking to a rage
In the end only once
All you need is a touch
Want to see love
Every thought you'll be shown
Every act will be known
I defend you
We'll awake every sound
Every chance I'll be found
I'll be with you
To the end now you come
Show your hands to the ones
To behold you
I've been awake through the wrong decisions
I've held my ground now I'm gaining soul
I've held my tongue through the cold realizations
I've been accused, but I've only begun
Take me on, take me on
I've been awake, shaking to a rage
(Take me on, take me on)
I've been awake, shaking to a rageEmbed
