Rattle That Lock - Live at Pompeii Lyrics
Rattle that lock and lose those chains
Rattle that lock and lose those chains
Rattle that lock and lose those chains
Rattle that lock

Whatever it takes to break
Got to do it
From the Burning Lake or the Eastern Gate
You'll get through it

Rattle that lock and lose those chains
Rattle that lock and lose those chains
Rattle that lock and lose those chains
Rattle that lock

Let's go do it
Have it all our way
Go back to where we blew it
And lose our heads along the way

So long Sin, au revoir Chaos
If there's a heaven, it can wait
So long Sin, au revoir Chaos
If there's a heaven
Rattle that lock
Rattle that lock
Lose those chains
Rattle that lock
Rattle that lock
Lose those chains

And all the other travellers
Become phantoms to our eyes
The furies and the revellers
The fallen angels in disguise

No Discord, Chance or Rumour
Is going to interrupt this bliss
No Discord, Chance or Rumour
To interrupt this

So, let's get to it
It's calling like a flame
Through the darkness and the night
A world suspended on a golden chain
No Discord, Chance or Rumour
Is going to interrupt this bliss
No Discord, Chance or Rumour
To interrupt this

Rattle that lock
Rattle that lock
Lose those chains
Rattle that lock
Rattle that lock
Rattle that lock
Lose those chainsEmbed
