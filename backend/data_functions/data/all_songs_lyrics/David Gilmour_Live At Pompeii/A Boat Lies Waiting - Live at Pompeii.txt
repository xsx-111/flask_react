A Boat Lies Waiting - Live at Pompeii Lyrics"Itâ€™s like going into the sea, there's nothing"
Something I never knew
In silence I hear you
And a boat lies waiting
Still your clouds are flaming
That old time easy feeling
What I lost was an ocean
Now I'm drifting through without you
In this sad barcarolle
What I lost was an ocean
And I'm rolling right behind you
In this sad barcarolle
It rocks you like a cradle
It rocks you to the core
You'll sleep like a baby
As it knocks at Death's doorEmbed
