The Great Gig in the Sky Lyrics
And I am not frightened of dying
Any time will do, I don't mind
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime
I never said I was frightened of dying
Gilmour: Thank you very much!
What a lovely place to be
What a lovely summer evening here
Ghosts from the past, from the recent past and the distant past are here with us tonight
That uh, that was a song written by Rick Wright back then,years ago
And now we're gonna do a song about Rick Wright written
By myself and Polly
Thank youEmbed
