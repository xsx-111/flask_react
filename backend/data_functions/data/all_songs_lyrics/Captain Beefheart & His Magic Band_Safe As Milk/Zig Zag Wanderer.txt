Zig Zag Wanderer Lyrics
Zig zag

Zig zag wanderer, zig zag wanderer
Zig zag wanderer, zig zag wanderer
You can huff, you can puff
You'll never blow my house down

You can zig
You can zag
Ol' house gonna stay
Gon' stay around
Gon' stay around

You can jump (You can jump)
You can holler (You can holler)
Never lose (Never lose)
What I found (What I found)
Heaven's free (Heaven's free)
'Cept for a dollar

You can zig (You can zig)
You can zag (You can zag)
Ol' house gonna stay (House gonna stay)
Gon' stay around
Gon' stay around
The zig zag wanderer had a zig zag child
Zig zag traveler fathered mercy mild
Found his queen in Natures' scene
Quenched his thirst where he'd never been
Zig zag wanderer (Zig zag wanderer)
Zig zag wanderer (Zig zag wanderer)
You can dance (You can dance)
You can prance (You can prance)
These ole timbers (These ole timbers)
Got strong beams (Got strong beams)
Got my shield
Put away my lance
Zig zag child, mercy mild
Zig zag dream, zig zag dreams
