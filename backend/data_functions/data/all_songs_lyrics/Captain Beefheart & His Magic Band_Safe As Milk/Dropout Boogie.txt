Dropout Boogie Lyrics
You wanna do what?
You wanna do what?
I told you what
I told you what
You wanna do what?
You wanna do what?
I told you what
I told you what
Go to school, go to school
Go to school, go to school
Just can't, just can't
Just can't, just can't
Dropout, dropout
Dropout, dropout
Can't get a job
Can't get a job
Don't know what it
Don't know what it
What it's all about
What it's all about

You told her you love her
So bring her to mother
You love her, adapt her
Do you love her, adapt her
Adapt her, adapter
Adapt her, adapter
And what about after that?
What about after that?
Support her, support her
She said she's a boarder
Get a job, get a job
Get a job, get a job
You gotta support her

You told her you love her
So bring her to mother
You love her, adapt her
You love her, adapt her
Adapt her, adapter
Adapt her, adapter
And what about after that?
And what about after that?Embed
