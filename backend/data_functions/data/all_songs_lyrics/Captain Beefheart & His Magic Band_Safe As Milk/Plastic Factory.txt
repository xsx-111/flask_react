Plastic Factory Lyrics
Phosphorus chimney burnin'
Modern men’s a-learnin'
Time and space a-turnin'
Motors 'n' men churnin'

Factory's no place for me
Boss man, let me be

Wind and wave all blowin'
Mountain 'n' sky showin'
Bee 'n' flower growin'
Boy 'n' girl are glowin'

Factory's no place for me
Boss man, let me be


Factory's no place for me
Boss man, let me be
Mind 'n' sight are goin'
Muscle ‘n' bone a-showin'
One thing sure I'm knowin'
Get a fire a-goin'

Factory's no place for me
Boss man, let me be

Boss man, leave me be
Boss man, leave me beEmbed
