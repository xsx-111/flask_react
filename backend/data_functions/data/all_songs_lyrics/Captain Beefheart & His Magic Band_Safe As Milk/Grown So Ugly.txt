Grown So Ugly Lyrics
I got up this morning
And I put on my shoes
I strung my shoes
Then I washed my face
I went to the mirror
For to comb my head
I made a move
Didn't know what to do
I tipped way forward
Got to break and run

Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Baby, this ain't me
Baby, this ain't me
Got so ugly I don't even know myself

I left Angola
1964
Go walking down my street
Knock upon my baby's door
My baby come out
She asks me who I am
And I say, honey
Honey, don't you know your man?
She said "my man's been gone
Since 1942
And I'll tell you Mr. Ugly
He didn't look like you"
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Baby, this ain't me
Baby, this ain't me
Got so ugly I don't even know myself1Embed
