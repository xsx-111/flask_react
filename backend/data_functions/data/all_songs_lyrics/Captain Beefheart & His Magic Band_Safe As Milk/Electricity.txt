Electricity Lyrics
Singin' through you to me
Thunderbolts caught easily
Shouts the truth peacefully
Electricity

High voltage man kisses night to bring the light
To those who need to hide their shadow deed
Go into bright, find the light
And know that friends donâ€™t mind just how you grow

Midnight cowboy stained in black
Reads dark roads without a map
To free-seeking electricity
Seeking electricity
Midnight cowboy stained in black
Reads dark roads without a map
To free-seeking electricity
Seeking electricity

Lighthouse beacon straight ahead
Straight ahead across black seas to free
Seeking electricity
High voltage man kisses night
To bring the light to those who need to hide
Their shadow deed
Hide their shadow deed
High voltage man kisses night
To bring the light to those who need to hide
Their shadow deed
Hide their shadow deed

Seek electricity
Seek electricity
Electricity
Seek electricity
Seek electricity
Seek electricity
Seek electricity
