Yellow Brick Road Lyrics
"The following tone is a reference tone, recorded at our operating level."

Around the corner the wind blew back
Follow the yellow brick road
It ended up at blackboard black
I was taught the gift of love
Smiling children, painted joy
Sunshine bright, girl and boy
Bag of tricks and candy sticks
Peppermint kite for my toy

Yellow brick, blackboard black
Keep on walking and don't look back

I walked along happy and then came back
I follow the yellow brick road
Lost and found, I saw you down
Alter-bound, alter-bound
Taught the gift of love
Yellow brick road took my load
Sunshine girl, sunshine girl
Come to my abode
1-2-3-4-5 miles long
Oh, I can't ever go wrong
Clouds were gray yesterday
Devil on my shoulder says time to play
Yellow brick, blackboard black
Keep on walking and don't look back

Around the corner the wind blew back
Follow the yellow brick road
It ended up at blackboard black
I was taught the gift of love
Smiling children, painted joy
Sunshine bright, girl and boy
Bag of tricks and candy sticks
Peppermint kite for my toy

Yellow brick, blackboard black
Keep on walking and don't look back

I follow the yellow brick road
I follow the yellow brick road
I follow the yellow brick road
I follow the yellow brick road now
I follow the yellow brick road
I follow the yellow brick road
I follow the yellow brick roadEmbed
