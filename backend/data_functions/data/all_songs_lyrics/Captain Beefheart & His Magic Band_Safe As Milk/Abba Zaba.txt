Abba Zaba Lyrics
Song before song before song blues
Babbette baboon

Babbette baboon, abba zaba zoom
Two shadows at noon, abba zaba zoom
Babbette baboon, abba zaba zoom
Babbette baboon
Comin' over pretty soon
Babbette baboon

Well, run, run, catch her soon
Draft of dawn, sunshine on
Babbette baboon

Mother say, "Son", she say, "Son
You can't lose, with the stuff you use."

Babbette baboon
Abba zaba zoom
Babbette baboon, abba zaba zoom
Two shadows at noon, abba zaba zoom
Gonna catch her soon, abba zaba zoom
Babbette baboon, Babbette baboon
Run, run, morning soon
Indian dream, tiger moon
Yellow bird fly high, tobacco sky
Two shadows at noon, Babbette baboon
Gonna catch her soon, Babbette baboon
Song before song before song blues
Babbette baboon

Abba zaba zoom
Babbette baboon

Babbette baboon, abba zaba zoom
Two shadows at noon, abba zaba zoom
Gonna catch her soon, abba zaba zoom
Babbette baboon, Babbette baboon
Run, run, morning soon
Indian dream, tiger moon
Yellow bird fly high, tobacco sky
Two shadows at noon, Babbette baboon
Gonna catch her soon, Babbette baboon
Gonna catch her soon, Babbette baboon
Yellow bird fly high, tobacco sky
Two shadows at noon, gonna catch her soon
Babbette baboon, gonna catch her soon2Embed
