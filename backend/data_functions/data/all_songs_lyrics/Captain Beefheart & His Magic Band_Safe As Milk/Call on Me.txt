Call on Me Lyrics
Call my name whenever
Whenever you're lonely and blue
In my house whenever
Whenever you need me to
Call on you

At any time, baby, that you need love
And a little of that understanding too
Feel free, love, to call on me, love
Cause I'm gonna call on you

I'll be there most any
Most any time of day
Call on me
To see you, baby, in the same old loving way
Call on me

If in the night you call and I'm away
Leave a little note, baby, I'll be there when you say
Call on me

I'm so lonely, love
When you're away, call on me
And if I should ever
If I should ever call on you I want you to
Call on me any always
I hope your love will always be so true
You call on me babe and I'm gonna surely call on you
And uh, you call on me, baby, and whoo, I'm gonna call on you

Come on, babe
Ooh, come on, baby
Ooh, come on
Come on, baby
Come on
Come on, baby
Don't you know I'm down on my knees
I beg you baby, please
Call on me
Call on me, babyEmbed
