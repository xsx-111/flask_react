Baby As You Turn Away LyricsHere am I one sad and lonely guy
One shadow of the man I used to be
Now it's past, the love I thought would last
You thought I had you chained
And now you're free
I know it's wrong but I'm still holding on
Still praying you will soon come back to me
But then you go, you let your feelings show
You said I gave you pain, and now I see
But baby, as you turn away
I will always think of what we had together
Baby, this is just your way of breaking my heart
And it's easier to say goodbye
Making me fall, making me try, try to make
You stay as you turn away
Now you're gone, this road I walk upon is just
Another place where I can hide
I'm still your man
There's proof of who I am
Except without your love I'm dead inside
But baby, as you turn away
I will always think of what we had together
Baby, this is just your way of breaking my heart
And it's easier to say goodbye
Making me fall, watching me try, try to make
You stay as you turn awayEmbed
