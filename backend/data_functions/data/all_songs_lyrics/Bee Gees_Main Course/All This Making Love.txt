All This Making Love Lyrics
About an hour or more
When I go upstairs
You can read between the lines
I can make it to the top
But then I gotta stop
But I'm all right

I'm really fine
It's just the wine
And all this making love

In a day or so
It'll really show
Gonna wear me to the ground
It's just the way it goes
She keeps me on my toes
But I'm all right

And should I mind
It's just the wine
And all this making love
And I can't keep still
Gonna make a will
'cause I'm losing all my hair
I try to make it seem
It isn't just a dream
And I'm all right

I'm almost there
It isn't fair
To wake up all this making love

I get pleasure and pain
It's a gravy train
It's a wonderland, it's a ride
And the rumor is I'm told
She's really got a hold
And I'm all right


She'll be making me strung by the tip of my tongue
Like a tiger in a cage
She's got me up a wall
I'm slowing to a crawl
But I'm all right

Too much too much too much too much...Embed
