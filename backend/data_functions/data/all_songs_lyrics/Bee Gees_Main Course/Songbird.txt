Songbird Lyrics
Go on with your song, bird
You can't go wrong bird
You will go on and on, bird
Like you did before
Though your wings are broken
The sky is so wide open
And the wind is waiting for you
Like an open door

Though you go so far away
Your voice will still be heard so well
You'll never really ever know
How beautiful you are
When the moon is on the rise
I'll try to make my songbird fly
I wonder if he ever will
And if he really did, how far



Go on with your song, bird
You can't go wrong bird
You will go on and on, bird
Through the open door
Go on with your song, bird
You can't go wrong my bird
You will go on and on, bird
Like you did before
Like you did beforeEmbed
