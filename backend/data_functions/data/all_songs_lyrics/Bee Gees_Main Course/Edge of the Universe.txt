Edge of the Universe LyricsJust my dog and I
At the edge of the universe
Well, I didn't want to bring her
And I know it'll make her worse
Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there
And they call me Shenandora in the air
Well, I'm ten feet tall
But I'm only three feet wide
And I live inside an ocean that flows
On the other side
If I came back down tomorrow
Would it all be far too soon?
And it looks like it's gonna be a lovely afternoon
I thought that I was going home
And all the way I kept on praying
I couldn't stop to turn around;
Well, here I am and here I'm staying
It's been my longest journey
And I've come through the black of night
I was tired and hungry
When I saw your distant light
Well, I know this may sound crazy
But I'm sure I got here first
I'm just me, Shenandora
At the edge of the universe
I thought that I was going home
And all the way I kept on praying
I couldn't stop to turn around;
Well, here I am and here I'm staying
Just my dog and I
At the edge of the universe
Well, I didn't want to bring her
And I know it'll make her worse
Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there
And they call me Shenandora in the air
At the edge of the universe...Embed
