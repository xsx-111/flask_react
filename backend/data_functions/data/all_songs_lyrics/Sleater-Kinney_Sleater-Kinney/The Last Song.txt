The Last Song LyricsThis song, your song
Is the last song I'll ever do
For you about me
'Cause your games are through
I won't think, I won't breathe
I won't even close my eyes to dream
I'd starve you right out of me
If I knew what else to eat
You said this would be
The last time you'd ever hurt me
You said this would be
The last time I'd ever cry
Last time I didn't know
How was I supposed to know?
This time I found it
I know how to scream
I don't owe you anything
I'm not part of you
You can't take away everything
I'm not one of you
This song, your song
Is the only song I'll ever do
About you for me
So I can stay alive
I can't think, I can't breathe
I can't even close my eyes to dream
I need you out of me
Before I turn into you
I can't stand to look at you
Until you remember everything
I can't be what you are
What you think, what you do
I know what it means when
I look at you, I look at you
This time I'm looking
And telling on you
I don't owe you anything
I'm not part of you
You can't take away everything
I'm not one of you
Can you feel me coming after you?
Can you feel, I'm right behind you?
Can you hear me telling on you?
Can you feel me tearing outta you?
This song, your song
Is the last song I'll ever do
For you about me
'Cause your games are through
This time I don't feel bad
For anything I've ever said
This time I want them
To know what you didEmbed
