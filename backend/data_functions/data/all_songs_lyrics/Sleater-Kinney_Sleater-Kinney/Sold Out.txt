Sold Out LyricsSold out do do you wanna it
On a magazine cover
Take it, it's my body
Take it, I want money
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Wanna be a star
Watch me go nowhere
Sucking on his dick
Fuck it, I want money
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
I see the way you look at girls
You think that I don't know it
I know what you want from me
I know what you want from me
Sold out do do you wanna it
On a magazine cover
Take it, it's my body
Oooh, oooh I don't wannaEmbed
