The Day I Went Away LyricsAll the things I tried to tell you
On the day I went away
Do I always have to leave
For you to want me here to stay
Couldn't you just tell me you'd miss me
All those things we never say
And I saw you sit there smiling
As my plane just flew away
So far
So good
So far
I would
So far
So good
So far
I would
All the things I tried to write you
From so very far away
Never had the time to tell you
Reasons why I run away
If I was with you tomorrow
Would you still feel far away?
When I look and I can't find you
Feels like you have gone away
So far
So good
So far
I would
So far
So good
So far
I would
Please remember, please remember me
Please remember, please remember me
So far
So good
So far
I would
So far
So good
So far
I would
All the things I tried to tell you
On the day I went away
Do I always have to leave
For you to want me here to stay
Can't you just tell me you'll miss me
All those things we never say
I remember what its like there
Towns that drive me far awayEmbed
