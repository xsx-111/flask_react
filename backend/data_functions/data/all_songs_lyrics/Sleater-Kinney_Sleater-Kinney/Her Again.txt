Her Again LyricsI don't know what you mean
I don't remember it
It doesn't mean a thing
I'm just a normal girl
I'm down in that hole where you left me
There both body and soul
I am filled with all the sick things
And I am getting out of here
I'm her again
I'm her again
I'm her again
I'm her again
I didn't say that thing
I don't remember it
I wasn't there that day
I didn't see a thing
I am in this thing
Well, they say a body remembers it
Going
I am getting out of here
I'm her again
I'm her again
I'm her again
I'm her again
????????
I'm her again
????????
I'm her again
I didn't say that thing
I don't remember it
I wasn't there that day
I don't know what you meanEmbed
