Be Yr Mama LyricsHold onto it
Hold onto it
Make you better
I made you better
You're inside me
I'm your mommy
I know what is going on here
I always make you so stronger
Can't you see that I need to
Can't you see that I need to, yeah
Hold onto it
You hold onto me
Fix it for you
I fixed it for you
But I don't wanna
Be your mama
I know what is going on here
I always make you so stronger
Can't you see that I need to
Can't you see that I need to, yeah
Just a little more
Is what I wait for
Just a little more
Is what I wait for
Hold onto it
You hold onto me
But I'm not gonna
Be your mamaEmbed
