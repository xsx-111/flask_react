Slow Song LyricsHeard what you said, I heard what you said
On that day
Wasn't so nice, it wasn't so nice
As I thought it would be
Don't you know that I would go
If I had a way
Running for my life, I'm running from those eyes
And if it feels that way
'Cause it doesn't work that way
It didn't work today
Feeling so down, I'm feeling so down
That I could go
Run into a tree or run into the street
Then I would, oh
Don't you know I saw you go
On that day
Running for my life, I'm running from those eyes
And if it feels that way
'Cause it doesn't work that way
It didn't work todayEmbed
