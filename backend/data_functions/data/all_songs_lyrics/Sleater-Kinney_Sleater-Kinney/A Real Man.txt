A Real Man LyricsDon't you wanna feel it inside?
They say that it feels so nice
All girls should have a real man
Should I buy it, I don't wanna
I don't wanna join your club
I don't want your kind of love
I don't wanna join your club
I don't want your kind of love
If you had it in your thighs
You'll see that it feels so nice
You wait, you'll cum every time
I'm not that dumb, I don't wanna
I don't wanna join your club
I don't want your kind of love
I don't wanna join your club
I don't want your kind of love
Don't you wanna feel it inside?
They say that it feels so nice
All girls should have a real man
Should I buy it, I don't wannaEmbed
