How to Play Dead LyricsYou want to try
Go ahead and try
You want it now
But thats the way it goes
You want to hurt me?
Go ahead and try
You're feeling sick
You poor thing
Clean up your mess then I'll suck your dick
Did I tell you it wasn't fun?
You want to show me how to play dead
How to be still
How to please you
If I don't give you
Just what you need
It hurts you, I'm such a tease
You're just a boy who likes to whine
I'm gonna choke
Can't feel a thing
You say go deeper, you like it when I scream
And then you tell me I'm so good
You want to show me how to play dead
How to be still
How to please you
What's good for you
Is not for me
What's over for you
Is not over for me
I won't suck your big ego
And swallow all my pride
I'm spitting out your memory
And stains you left inside of me
I'm sick of being full with what you fed me
What I choked down
Rip it out of me
You wanna rip it out of me
I'll show you how it feels to be dead
How it feels to be held still
How I wish you were deadEmbed
