Happy Idiot Lyrics
Stuck in the shade where there’s no sunshine
I don’t wanna play with them other kids in the sun

Since you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down
Yeah, you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down

What you don’t know won’t hurt you, yeah
Ignorance is bliss
I’m a happy idiot
Waving at cars
I’m gonna bang my head to the wall
‘Til I feel like nothing at all
I’m a happy idiot
To keep my mind off you

Stuck in a daze and I’ve lost my mind
I don’t wanna stay where the blame’s all mine

Since you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down
Yeah, you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down
So, I shut it off
So, I shut it all off
So, I shut it off
So, I shut it all off
It’s been a long way down
It’s been a long way down

What you don’t know won’t hurt you, yeah
Ignorance is bliss
I’m a happy idiot
Waving at cars
I’m gonna bang my head to the wall
‘Til I feel like nothing at all
I’m a happy idiot
To keep my mind off you

To keep my mind off you
To keep my mind off you10Embed
