Ride Lyrics
Caught up in a feeling
Cut right through the ceiling
Ground below receding
Blink of an eye, higher than high
Father, sister, brothers
Others born of mothers
Every friend and lover
Now is the time, get on the ride
Caught up in the feeling
Up against the feeling
Caught up in a feeling
Now is the time, I'm gonna ride

Lack of resolution
Crying in confusion
There’s one sure solution
Leave it behind, it’s time to ride
Pull into the station
With no hesitation
Well, congratulations
I'm by your side, it's time to ride

(All hands) Say the word and I'm magical
(On mine) Where I used to be miserable
(Wake me, take me) In a vision, a confession made visible
(All day, all night) We are more than only human
(All hands) Roll, roll, roll, like reflections roll
(On mine) From a hand to a hand come and take a hold
(Wake me, take me) It's just the ride of your life and it goes
(All day, all night) All day and all night
Every friend and lover
Soon we will discover
We turn into each other
Into the night, we're gonna ride
Think about the future
Think about the future
Think about the future
I know it's mine, I'm gonna ride
Everyone together
All at once, together
Everyone together
Look to the skies, it's time to ride

Lack of resolution
Crying in confusion
There’s one sure solution
Leave it behind, it’s time to ride
Pull into the station
With no hesitation
Well, congratulations
I'm by your side, it's time to ride

(All hands) Say the word and I'm magical
(On mine) Where I used to be miserable
(Wake me, take me) In the mirror, a confession made visible
(All day all night) We are more than only human
(All hands) Roll, roll, roll, like reflections roll
(On mine) From a hand to a hand come and take a hold
(Wake me, take me) It's just the ride of your life and it goes
(All day, all night) All day and all night
(All hands) Say the word and I'm magical
(On mine) Where I used to be miserable
(Wake me, take me) In the mirror, a reflection made visible
(All day, all night) We are more than only human
(All hands) Roll, roll, roll, like reflections roll
(On mine) From a hand to a hand come and take a hold
(Wake me, take me) It's just the ride of your life and it goes
(All day, all night) All day and all nightEmbed
