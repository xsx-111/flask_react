Right Now Lyrics
I see you praying on the dance floor
See you moving so inspired
It's got me wondering what you're asking for
While your soul is setting fires
See, I've been trying locked doors
It's getting kind of tired
Like a lot of a people wanting more
Reach for carrot, want a bite

(You say) Right now
(Have it) Right now
(The moment's) Right now
So, don't hold tight

Revolution, revolution
Rolling back to status quo
While the pace of evolution
Often seems a little slow
But the breath between the split seed
The nothing that it shows
It's the infinite in finite
If you want it, let it know
Say it right now
Play it right now
The moment's right now
Inside the flow

Say it right now
Play it right now
The moment's right now
Come on, let go

Falling into the all-at-once
Letting go of the things they taught
Had me thinking about the nature of want
An imaginary need for the silly little things
Past the right now, right now, the right now, love
Letting go of the source of loss
Embracing what can't be bought
Had me thinking about the nature of want
An imaginary need for the silly little dream
Past the right now

There's a golden light that's right here
There's no bottom to this well
Wealth of love and wealth of ideas
Peace of mind beyond the self
There's a golden light that's right here
There's no bottom to this well
Wealth of love and wealth of ideas
Peace of mind beyond the self
Breathe in the moment, let it magnify the love
Healing the soul, healing the soul

Falling into the all-at-once
Letting go of the things they taught
Had me thinking about the nature of want
An imaginary need for the silly little things
Past the right now, right now, the right now, love
Letting go of the source of loss
Embracing what can't be bought
Had me thinking about the nature of want
An imaginary need for the silly little dream
Past the right now3Embed
