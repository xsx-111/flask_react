Trouble Lyrics
Oh, here comes trouble
Put your helmet on, we'll be headed for a fall
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow
And the devil's got my number
S'long overdue, he'll come looking soon
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow

Oh, here comes trouble
These people talk too much, need to shut 'em up
Yeah, I'd rather be alone
Can you, can you feel that rumble?
All this borrowed time, it's been running out
It's the ending of the show

But I know now, yeah
Yeah, I know now, yeah

"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
Oh, I've changed my number
Wore disguises and went undercover just to
Just to hide away from you
All my ghosts came a' calling
Making noises 'bout a promise I had broken
Oh, I'm gonna be lonely soon

Oh, here comes trouble
Put your helmet on, we'll be headed for a fall
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow
And the devil's got my number
S'long overdue, he'll come looking soon
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow

"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"Embed
