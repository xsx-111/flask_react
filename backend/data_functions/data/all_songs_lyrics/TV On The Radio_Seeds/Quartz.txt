Quartz LyricsHow much do I love you?
How hard must we try
To set into motion
A love divine?
I should really give it up sometime
Should've known by the way things started
That I should really give it up sometime
And I should really give it up sometime
No reprieve for the broken hearted
Yeah, I should really give it up sometime
And now it's rolling down the wave
Hey, there it goes
Rolling down the wave into the fire
Into sun, steam and marigolds
And now it's rolling down the wave
I am yours, you are mine
Rolling down the wave into the fire
Through a lifetime of disagreements
And now it's rolling down the wave
Take me high, take me low
Rolling down the wave into the fire
Take me nowhere my poor heart can't follow
And now it's rolling down the wave
Reckless hearts soon collide
Rolling down the wave into the fire
Break through a lifetime of stress and evil
I should really give it up sometime
Should've known it couldn't last forever
But I should really give it up sometime
And I should really give it up sometimes
All I wanted was to love you better
But I should really give it up sometime
Oh, come and get lost, love
I don't want what you want
I don't want what you want
Why wrestle the tide?
I don't want what you want
I don't want what you want
All set into motion
Our love divine
And now it's rolling down the wave
How much do I love you?
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
How hard must we try?
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
How deep is the ocean?
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fireEmbed
