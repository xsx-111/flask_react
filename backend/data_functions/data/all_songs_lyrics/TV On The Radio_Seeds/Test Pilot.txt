Test Pilot Lyrics
Hope it isn't broken, tried to keep it open
But I couldn't hold it, smashed it down for all to see
And I tried to get repairs done, I couldn't fix it
So, I picked it up and smashed it down for all to see

But I remember when we were so cool
And you were the only one
And now I know that I was such a fool
Thinking you're the only one

(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are gliding through the things that tear us apart
(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are going to need the strength it takes to pave the way
And be the first test pilot

Now we're stumbling through the motions, criminal and careless
Thought you were my best friend, now I couldn't care less, can't you see?
And you're playing my emotions, way out of proportion
Damage and distortion, blasting through your fantasy

Oh, but I was such a fool
Thinking you're the only one
It didn't have to be so cruel
Thinking you're the only one
I know that we get down
But we can't touch the ground
Look up, fall into sky
Gone at the speed of sound
One circle back around
Straight on, test pilot, fly

(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are gliding through the things that tear us apart
(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are going to need the strength it takes to pave the way

(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are gliding through the things that tear us apart
(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are going to need the strength it takes to pave the way
And be the first test pilot5Embed
