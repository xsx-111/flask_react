Seeds Lyrics
I know you eat your lovers when you sense that something isn't right
I hope that's over and you're letting him go
I always wondered what your gypsy heart would feel like
I got a feeling that you're letting me know
I told your sister that you're all I ever dream of
Your sister told me that I better move slow
And then she told me things I never could've dreamed of
And then she told me things I should not have known

Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground
Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground

Lay down your liar's tongue, coat of arms, broken charms
And dance with me
Lay down your liar's tongue, coat of arms, broken charms
And dance with me
Lay down your liar's tongue, coat of arms, broken charms
And dance with me

I know you've got your reasons when you're keeping your defenses up
It seems to me too much, try letting them go
But hits defeat the misses and we knock each other senseless, love
We come together and we start to move slow
You've got me thinking that you're all I ever need now
I think I love you and it's starting to show
And if you hadn't shown me all the things I never dreamed of
I do not think that I'd be missing you so
Now we face a choice of three
One is you; the other, me
Free as air is third, you see
It's all I wanna be

Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground
Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground

Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground
Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground

Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground
Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground, seeds on ground2Embed
