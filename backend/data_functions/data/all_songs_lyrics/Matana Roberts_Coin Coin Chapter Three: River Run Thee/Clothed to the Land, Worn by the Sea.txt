Clothed to the Land, Worn by the Sea Lyrics
 to you
So the good book says

Did you not inherit her (<- ?)
Like the good book says
We held  built this maze
We hold him here every day
Born (<-? or) the good book says
But after 
 will grow in spring
So the good book says
So the good book says
So the good book says
So the good book saysEmbed
