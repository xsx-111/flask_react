This Land Is Yours Lyrics
...away with me
Come away with me
(Brilliant, phenomenal)
Come away with me
( keeping a supply for the ships, which, generally come to this island to )
Away, away
(I forget that person I even remained and the way  supernatural light  the rapturous call  the small still voice, the small still voice, the small still voice, the small still voice)

...away (with me)
Away with me
Come away with me
Come away...
()
Come away with me
Come awa-ay with me
Come awa-ay with me
Come away...
Come away with me
( there was another question to consider however)Embed
