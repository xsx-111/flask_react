All Is Written Lyrics
The south

Your sadness grows as years roll by
You grow remorse, may even cry
(Well, at the head of the beach )
Old to live, afraid to die
The reaping of the willow
Your sadness grows as years roll by
You grow remorse, may even cry
Too old to live, afraid to die
(The reaping of the willow)

Why do we try so hard
Oh, why do we try so hard
All is written in the cards
The price rolls by the sea side
(Oh)

Oh, youngster there, perhaps you'll see
()
An image of yourself in me
When do you (<-?) add the score of three
And  in wind stream
()
Oh, why do we try so hard
Oh, why do we try so hard
All is written in the cards
The price rolls by the sea side

I was a sailor of the sea
I lived by rules of eternity
()
Oh, causing who to suffer thee
And now my conscience scorns me

Oh, why do we try so hard
Oh, why do we try so hard
All is written in the cards
The price rolls by the sea side

My body's tweed (<-?) roll the towns
Three drunken cursing fighting clowns
By the night two died in downs
Their deckster eyes still haunt me
Your sadness grows as years roll by
You grow remorse may even cry
(Now we maintain the )
Too old to live, afraid to die
The reaping of the willows
Oh, why do we try so hard
Because we should
Oh, why do we try so hard
Because we should
All is wirtten in the cards
The price rolls by the sea side
()
Oh, why do we try so hard
'Cause we should
Oh, why do we try so hard
'Cause we should
All is written in the cards
The price rolls by the sea side

Your sadness grows
And so it goes
Keep reaching high
And you will fly...
...low
Low
