Nema, Nema, Nema Lyrics
A good one never came alone
One destine for the other holm
I could not stand it all alone
(reach to top my steeple)
I wandered all with them one day
And found a challie challie play
So now we three can truly say
I sailed, alas, my people
I sailed, alas, my people
He taught me  tricks
Although I never called it quits
That was the bitter end
To deal and that 
You first must learn the double cross
Not only on the souls of lost
But on him, my friend
But when she, my friend
He carried til the end
Where the loss can now divide
Where the holy cannot hide
Because you cannot have them
That was the bitter end
Between me 'n' my friend
That was the bitter end
Between me and my friendEmbed
