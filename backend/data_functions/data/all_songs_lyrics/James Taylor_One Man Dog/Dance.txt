Dance LyricsCome on, baby, while the moon is high
Kick up your heels and dance
Don't be nervous and don't be shy
And give yourself a chance, you can dance
Kick off your shoes and lose your blues
Pick them up, Lord, put them back down
And around, and around, and around, and around
Come on, baby, it must be fun
To be dancing in the clear moonlight
Otherwise, would everyone be out
On such a cold and windy night? We can dance
Throw yourself away
Holy month of May, you can dance
Listen to the music of the steel guitar, don't it sound good, hey now
Nobody here tonight came to look at you, no, no no
Well I bet you five dollars that somebody starts a fire back in the woods, hey now
Everybody here tonight came to boogie and have a good time, too
Come on, baby, while the moon is high
Kick up your heels and dance
Don't be nervous and don't be shy
And give yourself a chance, you can dance
Kick off your shoes and lose your blues
Pick them up, Lord, put them back down
And around, and around, and around, and around
And if I could lose my mind
If I could throw myself awayEmbed
