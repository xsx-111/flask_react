Fool for You LyricsMy lady don't allow the life I lead
She don't abide by some of the company that I keep
She takes occasion to criticize and carry on
I love her so, I just can't stand it no more
I'm a fool for you babe, don't you know
Mess around momma, I'm a fool for you mamma, ooh
I should say, my baby knows that I'm crazy about her loving
That's all right, she takes unfair advantage now and then
She jumps at the chance to tease me with her body
Lord, I love that thing so, just can't stand it no more
I'm a fool for you babe
Look around, momma, I'm a fool for you
Let's have a sweet thing todayEmbed
