Fanfare LyricsSomeone turned the time on
Another day, dead and gone
A lifetime is slipping away, babe
But as far as I can see
That doesn't apply to you and me
We are high above the family tree
Hidden in the deep blue sea
Industry on parade
Punch a clock nine to five
The beginning is beginning to fade away
Ah, but look out from now on, baby
As far as the eye can see
Unafraid to be free
Shining on the silver sea
You and me
We got to be moving
Picking up, carry on
Lead your children by the hand
Carry on, carry on
Heaven knows I love you
Don't you know that it's true yourself yeah yeah
Looks like you and me baby dancing by the shining seaEmbed
