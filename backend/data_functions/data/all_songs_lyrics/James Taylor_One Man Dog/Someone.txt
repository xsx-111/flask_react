Someone LyricsSomeone
I'm searching for someone who'll be true
Who'll change my life of blue
Into a dream of golden rainbows
Where are you?
It seems I've been searching, searching more than just one lifetime
My heart is a magnet all for you
I'll know you when I see you
Within my heart is carved a sculpture of your love
Life is worth less than nothing without love
Love is the force from which all beings live
Don't you see?
It's the purpose of living to love and be loved again and again
Where are you?
My heart cries for you
My eyes long to see you
My soul is all for you
Oh, where are you, someone?
Don't you see?
It's the purpose of living to love and be loved again and again
Where are you?
My heart cries for you
My eyes long to see you
My soul is all for you
Oh, where are you, someone?Embed
