Back on the Street Again LyricsI don't care if I got no money
I don't care if I got a dime
All I want to do is to dance with you honey
Please tell me that you have the time
'Cause I got to get back on my feet again
Got to get back on the street again
La la la la la
La la la la la
Well, I don't care if I got no fame
All I want to do is to hold your hand
Don't care if nobody knows my name
'Cause I just want to try the best I can, yes I do
Gotta get back on my feet again
Gotta get back on the street again yeah
La la la la la
La la la la la
I don't know just what the world is coming to
And I don't know just what is going on, and momma do you?
Well, all I really know is I got to get back on my feet again, yeah baby
Help me up now please, baby
I don't care if I got no money
I don't care if I got a dime
All I want to do is to dance with you baby
Please tell me that you have the time
'Cause I got to get back on my feet again
Got to get back on the street again
La la la la la
La la la la la
Listen
La la la la la
La la la la la
Yeah now baby
Stand it up for me nowEmbed
