One Man Parade LyricsDo believe I'm going to clap my hands
Think I might tap my feet
Put together a one-man band
Take a walkin' on down the street
Have a one-man parade
Nobody needs to know
Because I'm right good in holding on to secrets
And don't believe they show
All I want is a little dog
To be walking at my right hand
Taking a breeze just as free as you please
Maybe checking out occasional garbage cans
Talking bout a one man dog, you all
Nobody's friend but mine
Hey now, you can say that he's looking kind of funky
But I do believe he suits me just fine
We were on the road again
I was wondering what to do
Ah but Honalei, it was pouring down rain
Baby she had the low down blues
Hey now, I was looking for my walking cane
Tying on my highway shoes
Thinking 'bout a one man parade, you all
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, hey
I'm right good at holding on
Holding on, holding on
(Honalei, it's raining, Honalei)
Sure enough (It's raining, Honalei)
It's raining, better hear (It's raining, Honalei)
Hear rain, buckets (It's raining, Honalei)
Road is covered, muddy water (It's raining, Honalei)
Talking about a one man parade, you all
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, hey
I'm right good at holding on
Holding on, holding on
