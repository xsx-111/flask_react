Little David LyricsLittle David, play on your harp, hallelu, hallelu
Little David, play upon your harp, hallelujah
Oh little David, play upon your harp, hallelujah, hallelujah
Little David, play upon your harp, hallelujah yeah
Hey now, I don't know for sure, but it's gets said, and I got told
Someone said that the streets of heaven are paved with solid gold
It must make a mighty good road
Little David, play upon your harp, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Won't you play your harp, hallelujahEmbed
