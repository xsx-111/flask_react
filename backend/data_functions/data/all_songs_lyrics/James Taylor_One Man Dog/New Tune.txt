New Tune LyricsIt's written in the surface of her skin
There's been a baby there given away in love
I see it in the little lines around her eyes, across her brow
She'll be drifting away from me now
She'll shape all the feeling that's not quite there inside my soul
Love has gone away now, leaving behind an empty hole
And who am I to try to compete with the din
As the silence so easily rushes in?
I will fly away
It was something that I only dreamed of
Something that I'm not quite sure of
Something that I'll never tell you aboutEmbed
