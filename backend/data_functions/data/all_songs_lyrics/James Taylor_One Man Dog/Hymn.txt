Hymn LyricsI got holy children to show me the light
Singing hallelujah, brother how about you?
Yeah, we got holy scriptures here that prove us to be right
In believing out loud what we wish to be true
Well I got stoned out neighbors to take me in tow
Singing close your eyes, singing open wide
Watch the world fall away below, let the winter wind blow
And where will we hide when it comes from inside?
Oh, hear me now, hear me now, hear me now
Hear me now, hear me now, hear me now
Hear me now, listen I got sweet, sweet music sometimes
Yes, a child inside me was alone in the night
Now has come to me, love has set my soul free
As a man and a woman stand alone in the night
Here is reason to be like the sun on the seaEmbed
