Chili Dog LyricsMake my bed out of Wonder Bread
Spread some mustard upon my head
I don't want no onions or sauerkraut, mama
Hold on to the bun, baby, work it on out
I'm a chili dog
I guess you guessed by now, babe
Sure enough, I'm a chili dog
Look at me, delicious
Don't get jealous
Better not up and get overzealous
Watch out now you all
Come on now fella
Pass me down the relish
Don't read no Ann Landers
Just don't feed me no Colonel Sanders
I am not trying to fool you's
Don't bring home no Orange Julius
Got to havin' one more time
Get on down again, woh, woh, chili dog baby
Yes indeed, I want a chili dog, yeah
Talking about stone delicious, good for you tooEmbed
