Ho Tsing Mee (A Song of the Sun) LyricsIn the beginning
When earth and heaven had no names
All was peaceful
And everything was just the same
Here is the ending
Children dying in their daddy's war
Heroes who've been there
Say they never wanna fight no more
And through a long and sleepless night
Can you still say it's all right
To a mother who has lost
Her only son, oh no
Sing me a song of the sun now
Sing me a song of the sun
Love is the answer
I've heard that too many times
How can you change the people's hearts
When you can't even change their minds
Heavenly father
Oh I just don't seem to understand
Surely you would free us all
With just one wave of your hand
But with so many souls to keep
And a universe so deep
Can it be you just don't hear us
When we weep
One in all
Help me now, all in one
Make me one
Whit the Father and the Son
Oh one in all
All in one
Help me now, make me one
Whit the Father and the Son
Oh one in all
All in one
Make me one, make me one
Whit the Father and the Son
Make me oneEmbed
