What Color Is Love LyricsIs it wrong or is it right?
Is it black or is it white?
What color is love?
Is it here or is it there?
Is it really everywhere?
What color is love?
Is it strong like a mountains
Or deep like a fountain?
Is flowing free
And what about me
How can you receive
If you're not a believer
Is it blue like the sky
And does it really reach that high?
What color is love?
Is it near or is it far
Or is it distant like a star?
What color is love?
Does it glow like an ember
And do you remember?
If love doesn't last
Does it live in the past
And heart cannot live
If a heart isn't giving
When it's over
Does it show
Does it leave
An afterglow
And i really want to know
What color is love?Embed
