Dancing Girl Lyrics
I saw a dream last night
Bright like a falling star
And the sources of light
Seemed so near
Yet so far

I thought I was in flight
Out where the planets are
Moving between day and night
Here am I
And there you are

Follow the dancing girl
Vision and embrace
Such an entrancing girl
She moves with such rhythm and grace
Who can she be?
Follow the dancing girl
Go to the quiet place
Here in the weary world
Somewhere between time and space
We shall be free

Each of us is born alone
Well, welcome to the twilight zone
You can leave with only what you bring
Things we cannot see appear
Singing songs we cannot hear
And everything is surely everything
Meanwhile in the ghetto's dust and gloom
Bird is blowin' in his room
All those notes
All those notes
All those notes
Won't take the pain away
And man, you'll surely come to harm
With that needle all up in your arm
And dope will never turn the night to day
Just a little further down the line
Baby sister, it's these streets at night
I say the wind blows chilly
And the women need new shoes
So just tell her
Said, tell her what you wanna do
Boogie, bop or boogaloo?
I said, tell her what you wanna do
Boogie, bop or boogaloo?
Tell her what you wanna do
Boogie, bop or boogaloo?
I said, tell her, tell her
What you wanna do
Boogie, bop or boogaloo?

Dance, girl


I saw a dream last night
Bright like a falling star
And the sources of light
Seemed so near
Yet so farEmbed
