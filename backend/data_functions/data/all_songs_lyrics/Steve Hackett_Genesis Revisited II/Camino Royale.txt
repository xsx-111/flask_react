Camino Royale LyricsWalking along the Camino Royale
The Mississippi sighs
Soft in the night when the wind starts to rise
And I'm lifted high around the corner
So I spin, fast as a ride at the fair
Like a snake that flies through the air
When I cry enough I'm fired from a gun and thrown through the doors
Only the fool learns to get through
Ahead I see candles floating in pails
Each placed upon a chair
Into a tent where they turn round the bend
Through a kitchen leading to a staircase
Now I stop, seems that I've been led astray
There are no new answers today
This road is blocked, only the fool learns to get through
Only the fool learns to get throughEmbed
