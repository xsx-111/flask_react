Dancing with the Moonlit Knight Lyrics"Can you tell me where my country lies?" said the unifaun to his true love's eyes
"It lies with me!" cried the Queen of Maybe
For her merchandise, he traded in his prize
"Paper late!" cried a voice in the crowd
"Old man dies!" The note he left was signed "Old Father Thames"
It seems he's drowned;
Selling England by the pound
Citizens of Hope and Glory
Time goes by - "it's the time of your life"
Easy now, sit you down
Chewing through your Wimpy dreams, they eat without a sound;
Digesting England by the pound
Young man says, "you are what you eat" - eat well
Old man says "you are what you wear" - wear well
You know what you are, you don't give a damn;
Bursting your belt that is your homemade sham
The Captain leads his dance right on through the night
Join the dance...
Follow on! Till the Grail sun sets in the mould
Follow on! Till the gold is cold
Dancing out with the moonlit knight
Knights of the Green Shield stamp and shout
There's a fat old lady outside the saloon; Laying out the credit cards she plays Fortune
The deck is uneven right from the start;
And all of their hands are playing apart
The Captain leads his dance right on through the night
Join the dance...
Follow on! A Round Table-talking down we go
You're the show!
Off we go with: You play the hobbyhorse
I'll play the fool
We'll tease the bull
Ringing round and loud, loud & round
Follow on! With a twist of the world we go
Follow on! Till the gold is cold
Dancing out with the moonlit knight
Knights of the Green Shield stamp and shoutEmbed
