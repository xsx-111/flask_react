Shadow of the Hierophant LyricsVeiling the nightshade bride stalks a flower revealed
Nearing the hour make haste to their threshold concealed
Lost in thought in search of vision
As the moon eclipsed the sun
Casting the same steps glimpsing his own fate to come
Melt in the dream void from which he never can run
Lost in thought in search of vision
As the moon eclipsed the sun
Tears fill the fountains failing their promise to heal
Rippling the waters mirror an ended ideal
Deep in thought but robbed of vision
As the moon eclipsed the sun2Embed
