Broadway Melody of 1974 LyricsEchoes of the Broadway Everglades
With her mythical madonnas
Still walking in their shades;
Lenny Bruce, declares a truce
And plays his other hand
Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin'
Head buried in the sand
Sirens on the rooftops wailing
But there's no ship sailing
Groucho, with his movies trailing
Stands alone with his punchline failing
Klu Klux Klan serve hot soul food
And the band plays "In the Mood"
The cheerleader waves her cyanide wand
There's a smell of peach blossom
And bitter almond
Caryl Chessman sniffs the
Air and leads the parade
He knows in a scent, you
Can bottle all you made
There's Howard Hughes in blue suede shoes
Smiling at the majorettes smoking
Winston cigarettes
And as the song and dance begins, the children
Play at home with needles; needles and pinsEmbed
