Fake Fight LyricsI cry out in the darkness forever to be free
And I cry out so my loneliness won't get the best of me
I can see a brave tomorrow when I might just leave this town
After all these days and nights of anxious sadness left me tired and doubting
Everything I thought
I'd found
Apprehension, strange letters, found two kittens on the tracks
Got my picture taken twice today, when are you coming back
I can see a brave tomorrow, don't let this spaceship bring me down
After all these days and nights of anxious sadness left me tired of doubting
Everything I've got
My love
My life
Not this time
I'm found
This one's for this girl I know
Tree-bound bug-locked stare I know
A hundred and forty-one days no rest
Lest I miss one single kiss
There's a tree fort on this island
On the river by oaks park
We found it on our bikes and had
Fake fights until dark
This one's for this girl I know
Tree bound bug locked stare I know
I'd be a fly around your head or a pin in your neck
If you knew which you liked best
Well I looked into the distance, you said all I know is what I see
Sincerity not guessing at our own humanity
But I'm still driving up and down I-5 figuring what's fucked
Counting on the difference between underground justice and handmade luckEmbed
