Hate The Christian Right! Lyrics
Without your pain, restrain, you buy time
You never wanted to care; you kill, you kill, you kill!
Without, no out, fake smile, teeth, brain
You never wanted to care; you fuck, you fuck, you fuck!

Kissa kissa my girlfriend (all is well, side to side)
In the van at some show (and brush away)
I trade the kisses for pennies to stick between my toes

Without your pain, restrain, you buy time
You never wanted to care; you kill, you kill, you kill!
Without, no out, fake smile, teeth, brain
You never wanted to care; you fuck, you fuck, you fuck!
Dead!
He says he can't see
What's real
In front of your face

I hitchhiked to the Eastside (all is well)
Traded the pennies for seats (side to side)
In the bleachers at the ballgame we didn't speak a word (and brush away)
And fear, fear i'm sick with it (side to side) and I know why (and brush away)
Cement blocks on my face and legs
I'd trade the pennies to grow wings
And eight more eyesEmbed
