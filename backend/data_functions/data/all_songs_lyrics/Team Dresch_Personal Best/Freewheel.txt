Freewheel LyricsWhole lot of things to say but I can't seem to hold on
Moved away it pulls me back to what I miss
Like talking talking talking with the mad queen
About emotional evolution
Well I do what I do and I don't need you
To tell me what's in
And tell me who is cool
I've got no money left and the mean world around me and i don't-
I don't need that girl
To watch TV with
She's just the same girl
Over and over and over and
You can go back to your boyfriend
Half of this is me and I'm not sure who the other is
She maybe came from all of you
This house is warm
I think I'll take a nap
Just like Freewheel...
Freewheel!
Well I do what I do and I don't need you
To tell me what's in
And tell me who is cool
I've got no money left and the mean world around me and i don't-
I don't need that girl
To watch TV with
She's just the same girl
Over and over and over and
You can go back to your boyfriendEmbed
