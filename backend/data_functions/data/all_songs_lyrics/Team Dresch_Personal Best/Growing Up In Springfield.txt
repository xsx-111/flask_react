Growing Up In Springfield LyricsWhen I was fourteen
I fell in love with her
In metal shop
She said Kaia come pray with me
So we sat on her bed
And we held our hands together
She told me I needed god
I told her I just needed her
When I was fifteen
I liked to start fires
And drive my parents truck
To the Jasper store
Things were out of control
I couldn't stop to see
The others, the ones like me
Were not far from reach
When I was sixteen
She said to me
You have a demon possession
I said what the fuck does that mean?
She said she couldn't be my friend
Those were the worst years of my life
And all the hick boys loved to harass me
So I flaunted my
Hatred of the flag
My mother cried
When I shaved my headEmbed
