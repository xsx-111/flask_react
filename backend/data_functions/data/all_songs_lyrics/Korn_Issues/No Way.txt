No Way Lyrics
Lately, things won't go my way
Lately, everything is gray
It feels like something
It feels like nothing

So I came too far!
To end up this way!
Feeling like I'm God!
Feeling there's no way!

So I'm angry for today
Anger's the only thing I've made
It feels like something
No, it's nothing

So I came too far!
To end up this way!
Feeling like I'm God!
Feeling there's no way!
To live this way

Hating, feeling, falling
To the place where people haunt me
I can't help but keep from falling
To the place where people call me
I can't wait to give them these feelings of hating
Keeping inside me for all to take
Picking at me, they're ripping at me
Ripping at me!
So I came too far!
To end up this way!
Feeling like I'm God!
Feeling there's no way!
So I came too far!
To end up this way!
Feeling like I'm God!
Feeling there's no way!

To live this way
Live this wayEmbed
