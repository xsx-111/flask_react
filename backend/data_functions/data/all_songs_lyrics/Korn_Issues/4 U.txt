4 U LyricsThis shit right here is for you
All your faces I can see
You all think it's about me
I'm about to break
This is my fate
Am I still damned to a life
Of misery and hate?
You will never know
What I've done for you
What you all
Put me through
I do it for you
I could have never lived
If it wasn't for you5Embed
