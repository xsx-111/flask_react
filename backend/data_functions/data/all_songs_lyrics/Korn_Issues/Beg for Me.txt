Beg for Me Lyrics
Everyone is looking at me!
I can't get out of bed there is evil in my head
Everyone just let me be!
Because when I hit the stage, it is gone and I am free

Goddamn, you say you'll get up for me!
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me!
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me!
Goddamn, you say you'll get up with me!
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me!
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me!

Tell me, how could this fade?
I am going insane, and I could not have my pain
Everyone, please let me be!
â€˜Cause when I hit the stage, and it is gone, and I am free

Goddamn, you say you'll get up for me!
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me!
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me!
Goddamn, you say you'll get up with me!
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me!
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me!
I feel the shame I'm not insane!
The things I feel now aren't the same!
Who gives a fuck, if my life sucks?
I just know one day I won't give up!
Everyone just let me be
Everyone just let me be
Everyone just let me be

Goddamn, you say you'll get up for me!
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me!
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me!
Goddamn, you say you'll get up with me!
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me!
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me!
Goddamn, you say you'll get up for me!
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me!
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me!
Goddamn, you say you'll get up with me!
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me!
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me!

Be there, for me
Be there, for me
Be there, for me
Be there, for me7Embed
