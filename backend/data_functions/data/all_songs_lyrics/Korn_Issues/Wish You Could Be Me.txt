Wish You Could Be Me Lyrics
I am going insane
This shit is such a pain
I cannot maintain as the shit gnaws at my brain
I wish you could be me
And then this you would see
How tired I am and how she kept the best of me
At least you could look at me
While you are raping me
You are taking my life
And sellin' it tee hee
Why should I complain
At least it helps my pain
I am very cool now
And it doesn't blot my brain

I am going insane
This shit is such a pain
I cannot maintain as the shit gnaws at my brain
I wish you could be me
And then this you would see
How tired I am and how you kept the best of me
At least you could look at me
While you're raping me
At least you could look at me
While you're raping me
You fucking pussy!3Embed
