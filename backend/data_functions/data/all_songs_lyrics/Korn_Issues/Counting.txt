Counting Lyrics
I can't bare to face what's growing in my head
Please get away from me
Take advantage of what I still guess you do
One day you'll beg for me

So I'm saying nothing
Each day taking that much more
As I'm screaming all my pain
You will be there counting

You just see me as something you throw around
You aren't there for me
Beaten down to the ground, yes it always seems
You take more from me

So I'm saying nothing
Each day taking that much more
As I'm screaming all my pain
You will be there counting

It's funny how it gets started
They get their money grubbing fingers on you
They get your money, and the girls, and the fame
I only do it for the fun and for games
It's funny how it gets started
They get their money grubbing fingers on you
They get your money, and the girls, and the fame
I only do it for the fun, that's my game
So I'm saying nothing
Each day taking that much more
As I'm screaming all my pain
You will be there counting
So I'm saying nothing
Each day taking that much more
As I'm screaming all this pain
You will be there countingEmbed
