Dirty Lyrics

Keep knocking
No one's there
Pouring down
Near be felt

I'm out here, by myself, all alone
Ready to blow my head off
I hurt so bad inside
I wish you could see the world through my eyes
Each day is the same
I just wanna laugh again

Keep hoping
Nothing to spare
So my life
Isn't quite there
I feel like a whore
A dirty whore
Such a whore
Dirty
I'm out here, by myself, all alone
Ready to blow my head off
I hurt so bad inside
I wish you could see the world through my eyes
Each day is the same
I just wanna laugh again
Just wanna laugh again

I'll take it
I'll take it
I will take it
Give it to me

You dirty little fuck
Dirty little fuck
You dirty little fuck
Dirty little fuck
You dirty little fuck
(I will take it)
Dirty little fuck
(I will take it)
You dirty little fuck
(I will take it)
Dirty little fuck
(I will take)
You dirty little fuck
(It)
I hurt so bad inside
I wish you could see the world through my eyes
Each day is the same
I just wanna laugh again
I just wanna laugh again
I just wanna laugh again
Just wanna laugh again
Just wanna laugh again
