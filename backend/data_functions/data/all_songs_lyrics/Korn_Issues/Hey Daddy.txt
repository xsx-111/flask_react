Hey Daddy Lyrics
Let me see, all my life has been taken
This demon haunts me
They're waiting, help me

You fuck me up, I'm gagged and bound
You pick me up when I am down
I cannot live without them
I do not live without them

Hey, daddy, they are taking me away
Putting things in me
My soul, they're eating, please help me

You fuck me up, I'm gagged and bound
You pick me up when I am down
I cannot live without them
I do not live without them

They tell me this thing inside of me
Wants to get out
All it does is scream and shout
I'm trying not to let them out
They tell me to hurt myself
They tell me to hurt myself
They tell me to hurt myself
But I'm not gonna listen
You fuck me up, I'm gagged and bound
You pick me up when I am down
I cannot live without them
I do not live without them
You fuck me up, I'm gagged and bound
You pick me up when I am down
I cannot live without them
I do not live without them

Hey, daddy!
Hey, daddy!
Hey, daddy!2Embed
