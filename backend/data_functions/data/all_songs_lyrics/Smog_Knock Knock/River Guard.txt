River Guard Lyrics
When I take the prisoners swimming
They have the time of their lives
I love to watch them floating
On their backs
Unburden and relaxed

I sit in the tall grass and look the other way
And when I hall them in they always say
"Our sentences will not be served"

We are constantly on trial
It's a way to be free
We are constantly on trial
It's a way to be free

Most nights I go for a drive
To to the highest place I can find
Stand there on a cliff with goose flesh
Watching the wind rip the leaves of the trees
Death defying
Every breath
Death defying
Soon we all be back in the yard
Behind the wall
Living hard
Dreaming of cool rivers and tall grass

We are constantly on trial
It's a way to be free
We are constantly on trial
It's a way to be freeEmbed
