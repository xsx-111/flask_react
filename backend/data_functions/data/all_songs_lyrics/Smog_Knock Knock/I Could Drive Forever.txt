I Could Drive Forever LyricsToo many lines have been broken
Too many people have crumbled apart
In my hands
I should have left a long time ago
The best idea I ever had
With every mile
Another piece of me peels off
And whips down the road
All down the road
I should have left a long time ago
The best idea I ever had
With every mile
A piece of me peels off
And whips down the road
All down the road
I should have left a long time ago
The best idea I ever had
I feel light and strong
I could drive forever
Too many lines have been broken
Too many people have crumbled apart
In my hands
I should have left a long time ago
The best idea I ever had
With every mile
Another piece of me peels off
And whips down the road
All down the road
I should have left a long time ago
The best idea I ever had
I feel light and strong
I could drive forever
With every mile
Another piece of me peels off
And whips down the road
All down the road1Embed
