Left Only with Love LyricsI'm left only with love for you
You did what was right to do
And I hope you find your husband
And a father to your children
'Cause I'm left only with love for you
You did what was right to do
And I hope you find your husband
And a father to you children
When I lost you
I lost my family
You did what was right to do
And I hope you find your husband
And a father to your children
'Cause I'm left only with love for you
You did what was right to do
An I hope you find your husband
And a father to your childrenEmbed
