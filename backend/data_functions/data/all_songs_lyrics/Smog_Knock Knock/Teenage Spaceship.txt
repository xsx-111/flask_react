Teenage Spaceship LyricsFlying around
The houses at night
Flying alone
A teenage spaceship
I was a teenage spaceship
Landing at night
I was beautiful with all my lights
Loomed so large on the horizon
So large, people thought my windows
Were stars
So large on the horizon
People thought my windows
Were stars
A teenage spaceship
A teenage spaceship
And I swore I'd never lay like a log
Bark like a dog
I was a teenage smog
Sewn to the sky1Embed
