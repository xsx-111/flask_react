Hit the Ground Running LyricsI had to leave the country
Though there was some nice folk there
Now I don't know where I'm going
All I know is I'll hit the ground running
Only cowboys the southern gentlemen
Bedding women that will never mend
They ride the roads as they bend
As they bend to their dead ends
I had to leave the country
Though there was some nice folk there
And now I don't know where I'm going
All I know is that I'll hit the ground running
I was raised in a pit of snakes
Blink your eyes I was raised on cakes
I couldn't memorize a century of slang
Or learn to tell the same story again and again and again
I had to leave the country
Though there was some nice folk there
Now I don't know where I'm going
All I know is I'll hit the ground running
Bitterness is a lowest sin
A bitter man rots from within
I've seen his smile, yellow and brown
The bitterness has brought him down
I had to leave the country
Though there was some nice folks there
Now I don't know where I'm going
All I know to do is hit the ground running
Hit the ground runningEmbed
