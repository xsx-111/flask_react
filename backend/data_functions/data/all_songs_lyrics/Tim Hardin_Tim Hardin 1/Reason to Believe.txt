Reason to Believe LyricsIf I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live
Without somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never thinking of myself
If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way to leave the past behind
Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe1Embed
