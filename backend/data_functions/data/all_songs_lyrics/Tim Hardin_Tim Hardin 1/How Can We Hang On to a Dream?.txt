How Can We Hang On to a Dream? Lyrics{Intro}
What can I say, she's walking away
From what we've seen
What can I do, still loving you
It's all a dream
How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems
What can I do, she's saying we're through
With how it was
What will I try, I still don't see why
She says what she does
How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems
What can I say, she's walking away
From what we've seen
What can I do, still loving you
It's all a dream
How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems
How can we hang on to a dream
What can I say, she's walking away
From what we've seen
What can I do, still loving you
It's all a dream
How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems
How can we hang on to a dreamEmbed
