Part of the Wind LyricsFalling through my heart
In loving you
Flying wingless
Wondering what to do
Asking a future for you
Fortune falling with my heart
Luck be trusted in time
Trust the breeze to be mine
Hoping you'll be part of the wind
Running back to you
I'm waiting for the sun
Waiting, hoping you're the one
I won't chase you if you run
Hoping you'll be part of the wind
Falling through my heart
In loving you
Flying wingless
Wondering what to do
Asking a future for you
Fortune falling with my heart
Luck be trusted in time
Trust the breeze to be mine
Hoping you'll be part of the wind
Hoping you'll be part of the windEmbed
