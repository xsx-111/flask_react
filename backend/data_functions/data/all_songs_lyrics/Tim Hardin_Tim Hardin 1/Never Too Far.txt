Never Too Far LyricsThe things you sing
Will change you way
Like dark from day
Where you are
From day to day
Your lies will blame
Till you're away
But never too far
Do you feel more like going on
When i say i was alone, i choose you
Does it easy your heart to say
That tomorrow brings another way
I'll loose you
You might wonder since the time
I tried to do enough to rise
Your every changing life
Am i sliping sort of step
I try to do much better
But when i get
The things you sing
Will change you way
Like dark from day
Where you are
From day to day
Your lies will blame
Till you're away
But never too far
Do you feel more like going on
When i say i was alone, i choose you
Does it easy your heart to say
That tomorrow brings another way
I'll loose youEmbed
