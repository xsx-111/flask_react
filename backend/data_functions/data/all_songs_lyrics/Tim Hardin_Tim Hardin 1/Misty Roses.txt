Misty Roses LyricsYou look to me like misty roses
Too soft to touch
But too lovely to leave alone
If I could be like misty roses
I love you much
You're too lovely to leave alone
Flowers often cry
But too late to find
That their beauty has been lost
With their peace of mind
You look to me like love forever
Too good to last
But too lovely not to try
If I believe in love forever
I'd forget the past
You're too lovely
Not to tryEmbed
