How Long LyricsHardin
How long, how long has the evening train been gone?
Baby won't you tell me, how long?
I'm riding a railroad
I've headed out of town
The way things is it don't look like I
I oughta hang around
How long...
I'm riding a railroad
I got the blues all around my head
The way I wake up this morning
I shouldn't get out of bed
How long ...Embed
