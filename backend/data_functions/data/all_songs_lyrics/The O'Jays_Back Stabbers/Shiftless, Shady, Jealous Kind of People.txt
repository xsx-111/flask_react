Shiftless, Shady, Jealous Kind of People LyricsThey're sly, slick and they're mean
Meanest people you'd ever see
They're in every corner of the world
Man, woman, boy, girl
They're cruel and shrewd in their slide
On these times they take you for a ride
They get you and they gonna
And do what they wanna to your mind, to your mind
Better watch out for
Shiftless, shady, jealous kind of people
Watch out, watch out
Shiftless, shady, jealous kind of people
Watch out, watch out
They can't stand to see no one else
Keeping their business to themselves
Cause misery loves company
They're cold and 
Don't wanna see you getting nowhere
Be it riches or fame, so hear what i'm saying
Stay away, stay away from
Shiftless, shady, jealous kind of people
Watch out, watch out
Shiftless, shady, jealous kind of people
Watch out, watch out
Said you better watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
Said you better watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out for
Shiftless, shady, jealous kind of people
Watch out, watch out
Shiftless, shady, jealous kind of people
Watch out, watch out
Shiftless, shady, jealous kind of people
Watch out, watch out
Shiftless, shady, jealous kind of people
Watch out, watch out
Shiftless, shady, jealous kind of people
Watch out, watch out
Shiftless, shady, jealous kind of people
Watch out, watch outEmbed
