Listen to the Clock on the Wall LyricsListen to the clock on the wall
It's getting mighty late
Closer to the hour when we have to separate
Listen to the clock on the wall
It's moving much too fast
Girl, i love this feeling and i want this feeling to last
You step out to see me
And i step out to see you
We don't have much time
To blow each other's minds
Girl, you better hurry
Your huband might get worried
And my wife, she doesn't see
The change in me
Listen to the clock on the wall
It's getting, getting mighty late
Closer to the hour when we have to separate
Listen to the clock on the wall
It's moving, moving much too fast
Girl, i love this feeling and i want this feeling to last
Someday we'll be together
Forever and ever
Then we won't have to worry
We won't have to hurry
But now we gotta hurry
'Cause your huband might get worried
And my wife, she doesn't see
The change in me
You better
Listen to the clock on the wall
It's getting, getting, getting mighty late
Closer to the hour when we have to separate
Listen to the clock on the wall
It's moving, moving, moving much too fast
Girl, i love this feeling and i want this feeling to last
Listen to the clock on the wall
Listen to the clock on the wall
Listen to the clock on the wallEmbed
