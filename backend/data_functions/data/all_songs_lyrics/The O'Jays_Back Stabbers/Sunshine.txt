Sunshine LyricsYou're the sweetest thing I know
You dim the rainbow's glow
There's no power on this Earth
To seperate us, baby
'Cause you are my sunshine
You are mine, all mine
When it rains on my parade
You were there to light the way
You're rare as a rose in winter
You're more, more than I deserve
You are my sunshine
You brighten up my darkest day
You are mine, all mine
Baby, it's you
Words like darling
Sweetheart, forever
Girl, it's you I'll always adore
They only say I love you
But you mean so much more
'Cause you are my sunshine
You're my sunshine, sunshine
Baby, baby, you are mine
You're mine, all mine
Hey, you
You're my sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine
You're everything
I gotta love you sweety
Honey, baby
You are my sunshineEmbed
