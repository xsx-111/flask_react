Who Am I LyricsWho am I. Who am I
Who can't face the worlds goodbye
Who am I. Who am I
That think a man should never never never cry
I should've paid more attention
To what she'd said
I just wouldn't listen, I had a very hard head (Whooo)
Who am I. Who am I
Together that pass me by uhhh
Who am I. Who am I
A fool without an alibi
I should've paid more attention
Whoa, to what she'd said
I just wouldn't listen,I had a very hard head (Whoo)
Boo, hoo, baby, baby, baby (Ba, Ba Bop-Ba)
Baby Baby Baby Baby (Ba, Ba Bop-Ba)
Na, Na Nah Dah
Da Dah-Dah Da Da-Dah
Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Dah
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
What a fool I was to ever doubt your love
Love, love, love,baby, yeah
Hey, I'm lost! A fool am I, yeah
To doubt this alibi, da Da, ooh, yeah
Yeah, yean, yeah, yeah, yeah, Ay, Ay, Yay, Yay
Da Da (Ba, Ba Bop-Ba)
Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba, Ohhh (Ba, Ba Bop-Ba)
So lonely, lonely, lonely,lonely (Ba, Ba Bop-Ba)
To think I could never never never never cry, boo hoo (Ba, Ba Bop-Ba)
For you, Boo, Boo Hoo hoo hoo (Ba, Ba Bop-Ba)
Hey! I'm lost

Cryin', I'm Cryin, Cryin, Cryin, Cryin
Boo, hoo, Boo Hooh1Embed
