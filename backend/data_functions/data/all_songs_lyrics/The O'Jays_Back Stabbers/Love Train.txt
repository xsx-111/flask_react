Love Train Lyrics
People all over the world (Hit by it)

Start a love train (You)
Love train (And you)
People all over the world (All over, nah)
Join hands (Love right)

The next stop that we make will be England
Tell all the folks in Russia, and China, too
Don't you know that it's time to get on board?
And let this train keep on riding, riding on through

Tell all the folks in Egypt, and Israel, too
Please don't miss this train at the station
'Cause if you miss it, I feel sorry, sorry for you
