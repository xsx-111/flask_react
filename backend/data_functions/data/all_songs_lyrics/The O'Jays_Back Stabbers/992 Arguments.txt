992 Arguments Lyrics
992 arguments
992, quit just a-fighting
992, I'm sick of you

I can't even go down to the corner
To get myself a cold, cold beer
'Cause when I come back to the house
Your mouth is the only thing I'm gonna hear
It's a shame

All this fussing and fighting we're doing
Don't you know that it's got to stop
Don't make sense to go on this way
Our love affair is a total flop

992 arguments
992, quit just a-fighting
992, I'm sick of you

I don't want to leave you
But I gotta tell you just how it is
Life is too short to live in misery
There's so much that has to give
Maybe we just weren't meant for each other
You know, we might have made a big mistake
But two people understand one another
Tell me, how long does it take?

992 arguments
992, quit just a-fighting
992, I'm sick of you


Maybe we just weren't meant for each other
You know, we might have made a big mistake
But two people understand one another
Tell me, how long does it take?

992 arguments
992, quit just a-fighting
992 arguments
992, quit just a-fighting

Woman, what you're doing, you know it ain't cool
Woman, what you're saying, you know it ain't cool
You ain't got to do all this fussin' and fightin' that you're doing
You know it ain't no good
All this cussin' and fussin', what you're doing, you know it ain't no good
I'm supposed to be wearing the pants around here
But all I get out of you is static, woman
Making my children nervous, they can't sleep at night
Gotta stop this arguing, baby
You don't know what you're doing to me now
Come on
992, 992 arguments, arguments

992, 992 arguments, arguments
992, 992 arguments, arguments
992, 992 arguments, arguments
992, 992 arguments, arguments
992, 992 arguments, argumentsEmbed
