Eighteen People Living In Harmony LyricsThe opera is over
Singers have all gone home
Seats are all empty
The kitchen is closed
The sidewalks are sprayed down
The blinds are pulled down
Foundations unstable
The wrecking ball is back
Quiet business vacancy
Quiet business vacancy
Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
The symphony's concluded
The instruments are all cased up
The notes are silent
Music's still apparent
Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
Spirits are jaded
Art is trying
Is art dead
Art is dying
Is it dead
Believe it
We need it
To move on
A one track mind in a one way time
Let's go ahead and gentrify
We let art die with robot minds
They steal the brush and paint boundary lines
A stale kind of people we'll find
Walking in single file line
I think it's time to finally rewind
Let's go ahead, we might as well
Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
Spirits are jadedEmbed
