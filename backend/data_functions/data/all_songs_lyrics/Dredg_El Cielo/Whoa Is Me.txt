Whoa Is Me LyricsThe only things surrounding you now
Are the circular memories
Infect your conscience
They are the make up of your worries
Regrets and doubts
Elective betrayal of your person
Radiates confidence
Shine with silence
And shadow the ones below
This drought is leaving me
With cracked soil and brown leaves
Floating on a dry lake bed
With a dry mouth and a foggy head
Waiting for the snow
When the water comes
I will overflow
I will overflow
And when the water comes
I will overflow
There's one more thing
I forgot to tell you
Worries and doubts
Will only help you
In the long run
You'll shadow the ones below
This drought is leaving me
With cracked soil and brown leaves
Floating on a dry lake bed
With a dry mouth and a foggy head
Waiting for the snow
When the water comes
I will overflow
I will overflow
And when the water comes
I will overflowEmbed
