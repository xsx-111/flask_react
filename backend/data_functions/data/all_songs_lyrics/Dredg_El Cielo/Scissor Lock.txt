Scissor Lock LyricsI think
I'm awake
Rolling
On my blanket
I'm sinking
Into bed
Light around me
Beautiful washes of pulsating color
Buzzing white noise
It sounds like one hundred bees
I, too, once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I, too, once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
Lucid
You control it
Body's asleep
And your mind is awake
I, too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I, too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I, too, once thought the radio played
Let's act like children
I, too, once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I, too, once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzedEmbed
