Sanzen Lyrics
I can't even concentrate on this
It's over-thought, anticipated
The pen ink is running dry
It's been thrown to paper and wasted
Creativity has been blocked and over-tasted
Maybe in time I'll appreciate it

Hold on, hold on
We'll be with you soon

These papers are stuck in this book
Until they're torn out and pasted
To the inside of my memory
Where I can later look and see them in a new gallery
Where they can later be
Viewed and appreciated

Hold on, hold on
We'll be with you soon
We'll be with you soon

Longing for what has been lost
Longing for what hasn't been obtained
It's a small cost
Forgot the past, lost the future, only now remains
Hold on, hold on
We'll be with you soon
We'll be with you1Embed
