Convalescent LyricsThis lonely old man had heart
Resting gray hairs on wrinkled arms
With nothing but a stool to hold up his back
Skinny legs with Japanese mileage
Crossed at the ankles
He's unaware
Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Unaware of his surroundings
Youth, it passed
Swarming like wolves to a fresh kill
The scent attracts
He's just scared about dying
Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Save your clever statements
Brave your severed view of it
It's the only way to understand it
To believe that
To think back
To realize that
Those sad days have come to an end
Where are those
Where they all have been gone
Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Save your clever statements
Brave yourself if you want in
It's the only way to understand it
To understand itEmbed
