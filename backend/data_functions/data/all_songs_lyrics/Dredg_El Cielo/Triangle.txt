Triangle Lyrics
We are born into silence
And let it all be
Lift your anchor
And just float astray
Born into silence
And let it all be
Fortune in silence ...
 HEY!

Watch it explode
While fragments of irony's examples fly
And hit the shore
And tyranny's torn
From the podiums where leaders stand ...
But rule no more

Plead with nothing
Why don't we lecture about something?
Protest the way
We're passive today

Watch it explode
While it's not impossible for flowers to bloom and grow
Next to graves
And babies are born
In the same buildings where people go
To pass away
Pass away

We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes?
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes?

We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes?
