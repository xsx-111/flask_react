It Only Took A Day LyricsThink we know
Oblivious though
Unified clones
Sit like stones
Up on thrones
Of fool's gold
Looking bold
But all alone
Restore our needed shelter
Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Pants at my knees
Fading with growth
Lie awake
Buried stones
All alone
Restore our needed shelter
Our flawless endeavor
To be alone
To be alone
Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Pants at my knees
Sitting sideways
Something deep
Fading with growth
Lie awake
Lie awakeEmbed
