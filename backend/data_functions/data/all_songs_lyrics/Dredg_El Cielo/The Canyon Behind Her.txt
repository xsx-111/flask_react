The Canyon Behind Her Lyrics
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
I built a wall
It stretched one thousand miles
Set it off
(Massacre)
It's holding up the roof
Breast feed your heart
Set it off
I saw a distant port
With no water to support
Burning the bridge between

Never content nor satisfied
Tensions of self
The massacre changed history
Borderline paranoia
Yelling at their own rights
Set it off
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
Though half of me is gone
The lonesome heart is there
I cannot find the other half
I cannot find the other half
I cannot find the other half
I cannot find the other halfEmbed
