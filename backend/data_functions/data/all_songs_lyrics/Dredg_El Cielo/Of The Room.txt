Of The Room LyricsWhite cloth, black napkins
Wood chairs surround me
Wood tables, foggy sight
In front, with no light
Night falls beneath candle light
Cast shadows, incense fragrance
From the corner of the room
Cloudy senses, stale light
Below, beneath
Night falls beneath candle light
White squalls beneath winter sky
Night falls beneath winter sky
White squalls beneath winter skies
Faceless crowd of elderly beings
Roses sprouting, yellow glow
The sub-conscience into the night
Beneath
Night falls beneath candle light
White squalls beneath winter skiesEmbed
