Coming Your Way Lyrics
I've got things to do
I move everyday
I hope you don't mind
Because I'm going your way

You've got things to do
You move everyday
I hope you don't mind
Because I'm coming your way
You've got things to do
You move everyday
I hope you don't mind
Because I'm coming your way
I've got things to do
I move everyday
I hope you don't mind
Because I'm going your wayEmbed
