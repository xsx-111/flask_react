Miracle Man Lyrics
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

I'm looking for a miracle man
That tells me no lies
I'm looking for a miracle man
Who's not in disguise
I don't know where he'll come from
And I don't know where he's been
But he's not our Jimmy Sinner
Because he's so obscene

(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted

Today I saw a miracle man (Miracle man)
On TV crying
Such a hypocritical man (Miracle man)
Born again dying
He don't know where he's going
But we know just where he's been
Was our little Jimmy Sinner
That I saw on the screen
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man)
(Miracle man)

A devil with a crucifix
Brimstone and fire
He needs another carnal fix
To take him higher and higher
Now Jimmy, he got busted
With his pants down
Repent ye wretched sinners
Self-righteous clown

(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got busted
(Miracle man) Got bustedEmbed
