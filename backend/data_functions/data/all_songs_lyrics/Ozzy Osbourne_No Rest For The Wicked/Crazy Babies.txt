Crazy Babies Lyrics
Crazy babies
Crazy babies never say die
Born to live on a permanent high
Flying high above the world below
They'd better come down soon
Or everyone will know just why

Nobody's going to change them (change them)
They've gone over the top
Nobody's going to tame them (tame them)
They're never going to stop
Walk that walk, talk that talk 

Crazy babies
When they were born, they were born to be wild
Some say I'm another devil's child
Crazy babies in a world of their own
I am a crazy babe
You'd better leave me alone tonight

Nobody's going to change me (change me)
I'm going to do it until I die
Nobody's going to tame me (tame me)
So you better not try
Walk that walk, talk that talk 
Crazy babies
No use talking about if they'll last
Where they're going or about their past
They're just the result of our society
So frustrated just like you and me
