Bloodbath in Paradise Lyrics
You're coming home
There's blood on the walls
When Charlie and the family make house calls
If you're alone
Then watch what you do
Because Charlie and the family might get you

Can you hear them in the darkness?
Helter skelter, spiral madness (yeah)
Bloodbath in paradise
But there's nowhere you can run to baby
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep in paradise

California sun
But you're still in bed
And the California rain is turning red
No sign of life or the keepers of doom
In Charlie and the keeper's scarlet room

Can you hear them in the darkness?
Helter skelter, spiral madness (yeah)
Bloodbath in paradise
But there's nowhere you can run to baby
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep in paradise
They'll summon you
To wake from the dead (To wake from the dead)
As you lie bleeding, murdered in your bed
The sweetest dreams
Are all in your mind (Are all in your mind)
But no one wakes when Charlie creeps behind (yeah)

Execution halts your breath
Helter skelter, spiral death
Bloodbath in paradise
But there's no where you can wait now baby
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep in paradiseEmbed
