The Liar LyricsYou ask me the time of day
I tell you I don't know
In darkness I'm light years away
The voices come and go
Save me, all my life I've been a liar
Save me, all my life I've been a liar
Burning bridges in the rain
The crying embryo
I seem so blissfully insane
But still the pain won't go
Save me, all my life I've been a liar
Save me, all my life I've been a liar
Sacred words the angels wait for me
They'll set me free
But I can see the joke's on me
Babies crying other peoples tears
And in their eyes
They have reflected wasted years
You ask me who I really am
I still say I don't know
The doors have all been tightly slammed
The poison seeds are sown
Save me, all my life I've been a liar
Save me, all my life I've been a liar
Dying angels falling from above
I've had enough I cannot laugh
The joke's on me
Shattered dreams you cannot realize
Won't sympathize, it's in your eyes
Why can't you see?
Am I the liar?
Tell me who's the liarEmbed
