Hero Lyrics
I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to ever let you down
No, I don't want to let you down
I could try to take you higher
But I don't want to wear a broken crown
You know it brings me down

Don't think you'll ever understand me
I don't even understand me
Don't have the power to anoint you
And I don't want to disappoint
The fools no more 

I couldn't answer all your questions
And if you're lost I couldn't find your way
I couldn't find your way
You know you have to face the music
You changed your tune and don't know what to play
So don't you run away

Everybody's talking crazy
Some think I am a devil maybe
I don't want to hear about it
Don't want to have to scream and shout
At fools no more
The fools no more
So, I don't want to be a hero
Don't want to sit upon your crippled throne
I've got a life of my own
I am not your destination
Or a road that's going to lead you home
So, baby please don't go

Please don't go Embed
