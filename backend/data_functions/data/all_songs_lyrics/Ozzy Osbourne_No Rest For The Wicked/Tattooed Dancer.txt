Tattooed Dancer Lyrics
Well, she's a mean hard woman
And she knows what she wants
She is my tattooed rock and roll dancer
I'm under her thumb
And when she tells me to come
Oh hi's the only way I can answer

They tried to put me away (put me away)
God damn them

Well I can hear her moaning
Like a dog's that's on heat
She never takes no for an answer
She's driving me mad
She makes it good to be bad
My little tattooed rock and roll dancer

They tried to put me away (put me away)
God damn them
They'll never put me away (put me away)
My soul's on fire
Tattooed dancer, dance for me bitch
I think I'm in grave danger
Going over the top
There is no question, only an answer
She can't give me love
I think I'm falling in lust
With my tattooed rock and roll dancer


They'll never put me away
My soul's on fireEmbed
