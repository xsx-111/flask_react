For The Fun Of It All LyricsWhat do you do?
When you don't want to be dead
And you don't want to be alive
What do you do?
What do you do?
When you're on the ledge
But afraid to jump
What do you do?
What do you do?
When you're falling
But you've changed your mind
What do you do?
What do you do?
What do you do?
When you're growing old
But you want to stay young
What do you do?
What do you do?
When you want to change
What you've already done
What do you do?
What do you do?
When you want something
But get nothing
What do you do?
What do you do?
When you don't know what to do
What do you do?
What do you do?
What do you do?
Just being alive
What do you do?1Embed
