Kiss Ass to Your Peer Group Lyrics"Daring to be different" is a cliche
"Nonconformity" is passe
There is no room for deviation
Social rules have no negation
So kiss ass, kiss ass
What the fuck else are you good for
You think you're "unique", you think you're alone
You never learned how to think on your own
Your only basis for existence
Is to gain group acceptance
So kiss ass, kiss ass
Kiss ass to your peer group
Form your "opinions", repeat what is said
Make your own "choices", go where you're led
Think your own "thoughts", eat what you're fed
Strength in numbers, not in your head
So kiss ass, kiss ass
Kiss ass to your peer group
"Individuals" don't exist
Don't even bother to resist
Submit, conform, follow the norm
Obey the majority
Your group mentality
So kiss ass, kiss ass
Kiss ass to your peer group
Now you're ready for the real world
Now you're ready for reality
Now you're ready to be an adult
Get fucked up the ass by your peer groupEmbed
