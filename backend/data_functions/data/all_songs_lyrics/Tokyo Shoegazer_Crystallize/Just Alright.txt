Just Alright LyricsJust alright
Because you are so tough
Is it a lie?
It's not true?
Boredom left
It killed me inside
But you are beside me, beside me
Do you know me?
I do not know you well
Nobody understands you
What is reality?
It sure is all around
You'll be in my heart
Feel you
Feel me
Feel you
Feel me
There is the light you are looking for in the ideal
You broke it in my dreams
In my dreams, dreams, dreams
Just alright
Because you are so tough
Is it a lie?
It's not true?
Borеdom left
It killed me insidе
But you are beside me
Feel alright
Feel alright
Feel alright
Feel alright
It just feel alright
It just feel alright
It just feel alright
It just feel alright
There is the light you are looking for in the ideal
You want it in my dreams
In my dreams, dreams, dreams, dreamsEmbed
