Bright LyricsI close my eyes slowly
Fearful of the real world
Everything goes white
I can't see anything
Your whisper is also gone
What can I do?
A world of long silence
A clear heart and clear eyes
I'm looking for something
But I don't know what it is
I want to find it
Far away, yet so close
But I can see only you
I'm relying on the slightest hope
The world's been colored pure white
But I can see only you
I'm relying on the slightest hope
You close your eyes slowly
Fearful of the real world
Everything goes black
I can't see anything
It has gone out of viеw and your mind has changed
A world of long silence
Shе gazes at me with a sad look
Far away, yet so close
But I can see only you
I'm relying on the slightest hope
The world's been colored pure white
But I can see only you
I'm relying on the slightest hopeEmbed
