Back to My Place LyricsYou said it
This might be happiness
There are no clouds
Floating leaves
Drops of water fall
The dream is over
I bend my tired body
Was it all necessary?
Something fell from my hand
I'm worried about only that
Where are you now?
Can I come too?
It keep on hurting?
I'm alone all the time
Surrounded by stupid people
Am I good at laughing?
It is selfish of me
Because it is my only guard
While I deny it in mind
I only want a place to be able to go back toEmbed
