Get That Girl LyricsHey you, I'm dancin' with your girl
Her head is in a whirl
She don't know who to turn to
All right, I'll leave her just this time
But she could soon be mine
And I could soon be hers too
One night
Soon, if I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
Soon, if I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
I'm gonna make her mine
One night (Get that girl)
Soon, if I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
Soon, if I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
I'm gonna make her mine
He sits there drinkin' gin and
She sits there drinkin' beer like me
He's timing every move but
She's only killing time like me
And of course, what will be will have to be
But if I tread carefully
It could be a case of right place, right time
Hey you, I'm dancin' with your girl
Her head is in a whirl
She don't know who to turn to
All right, I'll leave her just this time
But she could soon be mine
And I could soon be hers too
One night
Soon, if I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
If I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
I'm gonna make her mine
One night (Get that girl)
Soon, if I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
If I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
I'm gonna get her
I'm gonna get her
Hey you, I'm dancin' with your girl
Her head is in a whirl
She don't know who to turn to
All right, I'll leave her just this time
But she could soon be mine
And I could soon be hers too
One night
Soon, if I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
If I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
I'm gonna make her mine
One night (Get that girl)
Soon, if I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
If I'm lucky, gonna get that girl
I'm gonna make her mine
(Get that girl)
Gonna get her, gonna get her, gonna get her, yeah
(Get that girl)
Gonna get her, gonna get her, gonna get her, yeah
(Get that girl)
I'm gonna make her
I'm gonna make her mineEmbed
