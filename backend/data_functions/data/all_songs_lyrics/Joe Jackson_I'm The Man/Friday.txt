Friday LyricsLazy Gilly was a flower child
All the summer, calmly running wild
She'd be silly and her friends just smiled
Pass the bottle, wash the pills down, what went wrong?
What went wrong?
She don't care no more, she don't need to fight it
She don't care no more, she gets paid on Friday
Cooler weather, it's not cool to smile
Pretty colours going out of style
It ain't so bad when you get used to it
Once you clock in, you'll take any shit, all right
Ain't that right?
She don't care no more, she don't need to fight it
She don't care no more, she gets paid on Friday
Monday morning, Friday's far away
Pray you'll make it, it's a magic day
Bells will ring and you'll go out to play
Spend your money, pass the bottle, Friday rules
Friday rules, okay
Ain't talking 'bout Monday, ain't talking 'bout Tuesday
Ain't talking 'bout Wednesday, ain't talking 'bout Thursday
I'm talking 'bout
What day do we get around here at the disco?
(Friday!)
Yeah, one, two, three, four
She don't care no more, she don't need to fight it
She don't care no more, she gets paid on Friday
She gets paid on Friday
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday
Friday, Friday, Friday, FridayEmbed
