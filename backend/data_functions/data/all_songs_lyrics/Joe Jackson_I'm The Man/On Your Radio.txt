On Your Radio LyricsEx-friends, ex-lovers and enemies
I got your cases in front of me today
All sewn up
Ex-bosses, you never let me be
I got your names and your numbers filed away
I've grown up
See me
Hear me
Don't you know you can't get near me?
You can only hope to hear me
On your radio, on your radio, yeah
You're gonna hear me on your radio
Radio, on your radio, yeah
You're gonna hear me on your radio
You're gonna hear me on your radio
You're gonna hear me on your radio
Ex-teachers still coming through to me
Tough kids don't stop trying to kick me to the ground
I don't care
Go on, just do what you do to me
You look so sick when you're pushing me around
You're nowhere
See me
Hear me
Don't you know you can't get near me?
You can only hope to hear me
On your radio, on your radio, yeah
You're gonna hear me on your radio
Radio, on your radio, yeah
You're gonna hear me on your radio
You're gonna hear me on your radio
You're gonna hear me on your radio
And you can't turn up, oh no
And you can't turn up, oh no
Ex-teachers still coming through to me
Tough kids don't stop trying to kick me to the ground
I don't care
Go on, just do what you do to me
You look so sick when you're pushing me around
You're nowhere
See me
Hear me
Don't you know you can't get near me?
You can only hope to hear me
On your radio, on your radio, yeah
You're gonna hear me on your radio
Radio, on your radio, yeah
You're gonna hear me on your radio
You're gonna hear me on your radio
You're gonna hear me on your radi...
Radio, radio
You're gonna hear me on your radio
Radio, radio
You're gonna hear me on your radio
You're gonna hear me on your radio
You're gonna hear me on your radio
And you can't turn up, oh noEmbed
