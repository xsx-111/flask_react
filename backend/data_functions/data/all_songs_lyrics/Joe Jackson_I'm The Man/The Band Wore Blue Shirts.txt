The Band Wore Blue Shirts LyricsI don't know why they come here
I'm only glad they do
They're gonna pay the bills for me and you
People out for an evening
They have a real good time
But when I play, I feel just like I'm miming
I made a stand for the music
To turn the page with ease
I got the smile that says I'm here to please
Me and the bass guitarist
Have even shined our shoes
The drummer's shoes are dirty to confuse
Yeah
I guess someday my kids will ask me 'bout the old days
I guess that I'll tell them there ain't much to tell
The waiters wore black dinner jackets and all that kind of thing
And the band wore blue shirts, and the music played on
Then at the end of the evening
They throw the suckers out
Don't get me wrong, I got no beef about it
I get my rates from the union
I get my shirts real cheap
I get my money and get home, get some sleep
Yeah
I guess someday my kids will ask me 'bout the old days
I guess that I'll tell them there ain't much to tell
The waiters wore black dinner jackets and all that kind of thing
And the band wore blue shirts, and the music played on
Yeah
I guess someday my kids will ask me 'bout the old days
I guess that I'll tell them there ain't much to tell
The waiters wore black dinner jackets and all that kind of thing
And the band wore blue shirts, and the music played on
The music played on
The music played on
Music played on
And onEmbed
