Geraldine and John LyricsSee the bright red sports car, see the happy couple
See their clothes so white and their skin so pink
See them playing squash, gotta keep their bodies supple
And now they kiss goodnight but tomorrow they'll be thinking
All day long, all day long
Geraldine and John
See the happy couple, so inseparable
And the beat goes on
And for better or for worse, they are married but of course
Not to each other
Geraldine and John gotta keep it under cover
See, they scheme and sweat but it's all worthwhile
Now he goes back home to a wife who's not a lover
Now her eyes are wet but tomorrow, she'll be smiling
All day long, all day long
Geraldine and John
See the happy couple, so inseparable
And the beat goes on
And for better or for worse, they are married but of course
Not to each other
And the feeling's getting stronger
That they can't go on much longer
Somewhere down the track
Something has to crack
Geraldine just packed all her things and went to mother
Johnny seems okay, happy wife, happy home
See the scar on his face from the day he met her brother
But nothing hurts no more, nothing more than being lonely
All day long, all day long
Geraldine and John
See the happy couple, so inseparable
And the beat goes on
And for better or for worse, they are married but of course
Not to each otherEmbed
