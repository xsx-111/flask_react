Kinda Kute LyricsYou make a guy feel humble
I make a fool of myself again
You make me trip and stumble
Just go dance by yourself again
I'll just watch
'Cause that's all I wanna do
But remember
That I'm here with your drink at my table for two
And you're kinda cute, baby, you're kinda cute, baby
I see you dance in your satin suit, baby
When you move, gotta sit right down
No competition with this kinda cutie around
I see you pass by my window
Have to run down the stairs again
I fix my hair round a corner
Catch you quite unawares again
And you laugh
And you move that way again
Just like last night, oh yeah, that's right
I'm the guy with the big feet but plenty of nerve
And you're kinda cute, baby, kinda cute, baby
See you dance in your satin suit, baby
When you move, gotta sit right down
No competition with this kinda cutie around
Well, well, well
Hey
Don't you know that all you gotta do
Is remember
That I'm here with your drink at my table for two
And you're kinda cute, baby, kinda cute, baby
See you dance in your satin suit, baby
When you move, gotta sit right down
No competition with this kinda cutie around
'Cause you're kinda cute, baby, kinda cute, baby
See you dance in your satin suit, baby
When you move, gotta sit right down
No competition with this kinda cutie around
This kinda cutie around
This kinda cutie around
This kinda cutie around
This kinda cutie around
This kinda cutie around
This kinda cutie aroundEmbed
