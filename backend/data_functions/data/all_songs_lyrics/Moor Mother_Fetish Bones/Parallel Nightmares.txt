Parallel Nightmares LyricsSoon here, very soon
We are gonna kill the king
Tell a story hope it transit trans-Atlantic
The fifth is branded in blood and revolution
Caught by the tale I outta give me fly slaughter side eye Carter
Right out of thin air thick thighs kick the moon in
Start the fire burn the liar
Sacrifice for the New Year
Ritual quantum
Reverse the clock bring back our light years
Eyes fear another ending in this right here
Parallel nightmares
No fear, sign a (?) listen here
These ain't hymns I ain't rhymin
All my Phyllis Hyman pills in my pocket
Oh yeah more time for profit
Russian roulette go hard til I meet my maker
Givin you the best of your maker, rapture
64,000 black girls missin no capture
But always a benefactor
Manufacture dark matter
Attack and disaster
Time don't pass
The cycle the same before and after
They blood bath ya
And so sincere
Eyes fear another ending in this right here
Parallel nightmares
Very soon
We are gonna kill the kingEmbed
