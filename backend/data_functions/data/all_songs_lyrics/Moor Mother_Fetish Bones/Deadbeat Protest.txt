Deadbeat Protest Lyrics
The babysitter just got paid
Karma just got a raise
Collect your blessings and you're on your way
I'm in line, I'm in line, I'm in line
At the soup kitchen, I'm in line, I'm in line
Got some bread, cheese, and some bottled milk
You ain't shit, so you ain't gotta stop and look?
Don't waste my time
These people out here just steal my shine
These pigs tryna roll my mind
These people tryna stop my grind
It was only a matter of time
You're  I committed warcrimes

Trying to save my black life
By fetishizing my dead life
What? get away from me

You can see my dead body at the protest
You can see my dead body at the protest
You can see my dead body at the protest
You can see my dead body at the protest
Trying to save my black life
By fetishizing my dead life
Fuck, get away from me

You can see my dead body at the protest
You can see my dead body at the protest
You can see my dead body at the protest
You can see my dead body at the protest

Trying to save my black life
By fetishizing my dead life
No, get away from me

You can see my dead body at the protest
You can see my dead body at the protest
You can see my dead body at the protest
You can see my dead body at the protestEmbed
