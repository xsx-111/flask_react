KBGK LyricsBlack Quantum Futurism
Transgender VHS
We are out here, let's go
We livin in bliss
Talking cockroaches utopian piss survivals with no conscious
In a burning church with four girls with fresh curls
Goin to see Emmett Till out his casket
Beaten to death with a hatchet
For whistlin at white girls
Blood swells we just dyin
Tell Hollywood to keep the flies flyin
No use for crying
They (?) dyin
And everything's for sale
Even your swag and your public housing
Chain gangs and penitentiaries now
The killings of the unjust
Go crush, get your feelings rushed to holy hold up
They shoutin 'Souls up'
2 for 5 who's movin out this bitch alive
Ye ye ye
The friar cried out
Before they're all together loud
And the guns and the machetes out
And the white academics to write about
And the Uncle Toms to hashtag and blog about
Wouldn't lie about
I ain't bout no business
No corporate friendships
This my grand bitch we dyin
Why you cheerleadin on the sidelines
Paper cup at the pipeline
It's go time
What you waitin for?
For them to lynch our naked body live on Channel 4
Burn the live remains left on the dance floor?
They still turnin up
Cause it's a lituation
Hands up, don't shoot
That your occupation
Kill black girl kill
That's my dissertation
And if you can't drop a bomb
On they plantation
Just get em hey
This one for my newborn son
Cherrie and Mary and James Baldwin
Dedicated to all my black and brown boys
You heard me?Embed
