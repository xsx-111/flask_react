By the Light Lyrics(Ay)

I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light
I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light
I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light (Ooo)

I came into this world that had crack in it
And some blood on me and some lead in me
Death creaking mama speaking
Get ya hands off me
And get these chains off me (Get off me!)
Came in the world out a pussy
Mama push me
Five seconds on the earth
Fuck faith 
Dealing with this 
Wanna be a master
Benefactor
Evel Knievel
Back off the planet
Damn I can't stand it
Sand in my eye
Roll the ball with my ancestors
Get my spine and my breathing in line
Now, now I'm back on the planet
Eyes stay slanted
Marvin like 3 wishes granted
Til the black women ain't shit to you
I bought shit  cause they horse shit
Big donkey dick
I don't miss shit and my shit sit like milk
Quick tears, breast feeding in public while mean mugging
I don't care either
I don't like reader
Spit down the back like Freda
The whip be like that
No video
We hang at southern trees
I'm bell hooks trained as a sniper
Sandra Bland returning from the dead with a hatchet
Lyrically none of y'all could match it
I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light (Yuh)
I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light
I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light
I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light

Said I'm bell hooks sniper
Sandra Bland returning from the dead with a hatchet
Lyrically none of y'all could match it (match it)
Lyrically none of y'all could match it (match it)
I'm right by the light, I'm right by the light
I'm right by the light
