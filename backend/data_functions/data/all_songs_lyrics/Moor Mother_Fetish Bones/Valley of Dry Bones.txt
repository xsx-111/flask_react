Valley of Dry Bones LyricsThey set me down in the midst
Of the valley which was full of bones
And caused me to pass by them roundabout
And behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were 
And they said unto me "Son, a man can these bones live?"
And I answered "oh lord god (?)"
Again he said unto me "prophesy for these bones and say unto them:
'Oh ye dry bones, hear the word of the lord'"
The prophet in the valley of dry bonesEmbed
