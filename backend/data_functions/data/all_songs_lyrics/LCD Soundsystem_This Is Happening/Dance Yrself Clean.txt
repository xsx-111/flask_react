Dance Yrself Clean Lyrics
Walking up to me expecting
Walking up to me expecting words
It happens all the time
Present company excepted
Present company except the worst
It happens every night

Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded every time
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company, the best that you can find

Talking like a jerk
Except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean
Present company expect it
Present company, just laugh it off
It's better than it seems

Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded in every way
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company, makes me wanna stay
Go
Killing it with close inspection
Killing it can only make it worse
It sort of makes it breed
Present company accepting
Presently we all expect the worst
It works just like a need

Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded in the night
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company included in the fight

Ah-ahhhhhhh
Ah-ah-ahhhh
Ahhhhh
Ah-ahhhh

Don't you want me to wake up
Then give me just a bit of your time
Arguments are made for make-ups
So give it just a little more time
We've got to bring the resources
I wanna play it 'til the time comes
Forget your string of divorces
You go and throw your little hands up

It's late
Oh
Honey, it's late
Oh

I miss the way the night goes
With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow
Though it's better than a bunch of others

So go and dance yourself clean
Go and dance yourself clean
You're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show...
Put your little feet down
And hang out

Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pile-up with you
Everybody's getting younger
It's the end of an era, it's true

And you go
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop

Break me into bigger pieces
So some of me is home with you
Wait until the weekend
And we can make our bad dreams come true
And it's a-go
Yeah, it's a-go
And if we wait until the weekend
We can miss the best things to do

Go and dance yourself clean, ah
Go and dance yourself clean, yeah
You're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

We should try a little harder
In the tedious march of the few
Every day's a different warning
There's a part of me hoping it's true19Embed
