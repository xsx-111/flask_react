Drunk Girls LyricsDrunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls cause a couple of heart attacks
Drunk girls
Drunk girls are unusually mild
Drunk boys
Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles
Drunk girls
Drunk girls are boringly wild
Drunk girls
Drunk girls get invitations from nations
Drunk girls
They got the patience of a millions of saints
Drunk boys
They steal, they steal from the cupboards
Drunk girls
Drunk girls like to file complaints
Drunk girls
Drunk girls are like a night of simplicity
Drunk girls
They need a lover who is smarter than me
Well drunk boys
Drunk boys, we walk like pedestrians
Drunk girls
Drunk girls wait an hour to pee
Drunk girls
Drunk girls know that love is an astronaut
Drunk girls
It comes back, but it's never the same
Drunk boys
Drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys
(Drunk boys have such beautiful feelings)
Drunk girls
Drunk girls can be just as insane
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
So oh oh
That means making eyes across the room
Drunk girls
Just 'cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless
Drunk girls
Just 'cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean but
Drunk boys
Sometimes love gives us too many options
Drunk girls
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean
Drunk girls
I've heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings
Drunk girls
A couple truths, maybe burn out your eyes but
Drunk boys
Drunk boys leave their irons in the fireplace
Drunk girls
'Cause drunk girls give them too many tries
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
Oh oh oh
I believe I'm waking up, but no promises
No oh oh
I believe in waiting out the weather
Oh oh oh
I believe in making eyes across the room
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
But still, be honest with me, honestly, honestly
Unless it hurts my feelings!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
