Pow Pow LyricsFrom this position
I will relax
From this position
I can see the whole place
From this position
Oh, oh just relax
From this position
I make some stand
I make my peace with the man
And it goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
From this position
I can see both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached
From this position
I can say "serious," or "cop-out," or "hard to define"
From this position, from this position
It's kind of like eating myself to death
With you on the outside
And me on the inside
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both!)
And me being uptight
And you being all right
There's advantages to each
(Advantages! Advantages!)
From this perspective, from this position
I have a good grip on both of them
Because I have stayed home
And have learned a little more about my neighbourhood
Which is important
You know, there's a lot of good places to eat
So it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
So it's pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
With you on the keystroke
And me on the gangplank
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both)
And you have been all right
And I have been filmed being ridiculous
Oh, eat it, Michael Musto
(You're no Bruce Vilanch!)
Now I have been untied
And you are all cross-eyed
There's advantages to each
(Advantages to each)
And I'm coming back, coming back, coming back
Until there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well?
I'm paralyzed
And looking through you
But if nothing's right
We try anyway
As a compromised, aggregate person
I'm amazed at my decision to play
On this occasion, there are a couple of things that we know that we pulled from Fact Magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night
So you should give us all of your drugs
Three, we have a black president and you do not, so shut up, because you don't know shit about where I'm from that you didn't get from TV
So times have been tough
And times have been tough
You have been put down, washed up, and rinsed out
But honestly
And be honest with yourself
How much time do you waste?
How much time do you blow every day?
And so it's pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Oh, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
So pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
(The return of the police!)
(The return of the police)
With you on the inside
And me on the outside
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both!)
With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each
(Advantages! Advantages!)
From this position
I feel an affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
But honestly
I should be careful because otherwise, I'm being, I'm being, you know, what's it called?
Oh, fuck it
Reclining, I'm getting used to it
Like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new
Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery
And then a couple of weeks at home
And then a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for
Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery
For an instant
You could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized
Regret anyway
But what you want for now
Is someone to feel you
And that's the thing you like
Is planning to stay
And all this time
It's so nice
It's so nice
It's so nice
(The return of the police!)Embed
