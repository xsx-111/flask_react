All I Want Lyrics
Wait for the day you come home from the lonely part
Look for the girl who has put up with all of your shit
You've never needed anyone for so long

You learn in your bed
You've been gone for too long
To put in the time
But it's too late to make it strong

Now all I want is your pity
Or all I want is your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Or at least all I want are your bitter tears
All I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears

Wake with a start
And the dog and the girl are gone
So you pack up your things
And head into the lame unknown
You never had needed anything for so long
And now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears
Now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears

From now on, I'm someone different
'Cause it's no fun to be predictably lame
From now on, let's do it different
'Cause I just want what I want
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home8Embed
