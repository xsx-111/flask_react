This Is Your Life LyricsThe spirit distilled, the soul is bought
The D.N.A. split, the virus is caught
The germination of reproduction
Complex patterns of genetic devolution
The die is cast
Birth, copulation, and death
Is this your life?
Birth, copulation, and death
Is this the meaning of life?
Is this the genesis of devolution?
The die is cast
Birth, copulation, and death
Is this your life?
Birth, copulation, and death
Is this the meaning of life?
Birth, copulation, and death
Is this your life?
Birth, copulation, and death
Is this the meaning...
Birth, copulation, and death
Is this your life?
Birth, copulation, and deathEmbed
