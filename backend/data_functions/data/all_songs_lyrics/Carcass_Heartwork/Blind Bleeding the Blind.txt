Blind Bleeding the Blind Lyrics
Parched with thirst
Our cup overfloweth
With the crimson milk
Of human blindness
In charnel towers
Of ivory besieged
The bones of subjugation
Are picked clean

In barren decadence
Tears are the only affluence
Welling eyes are indifferent
As the blind bleed

Blood and tears
Out damn spot out
The fruits of perpetual decay
Pouring the salt in open wounds
Out damn spot out
The scars remain
Will stay perpetual decay

Bloody hands never wash clean
Abject misery to bleed
Decadence to feed
Out damn spot out
Parched with thirst
How the other half die
Void of compassion
Our cup runs dry
With a silver spoon born
To dig communal graves
The only consecration
The economics of pain

In barren decadence
Tears are the fuel of affluence
Wells of blood run diffluent
A bitter harvest to reap...

Blood and tears
Out damn spot out
The fruits of perpetual decay
Pouring the salt in open wounds
Out damn spot out
The scars remain
Will stay perpetual decay

Bloody hands never wash clean
Abject misery to bleed
Decadence to feed
Out damn spot
Bloody hands never wash clean
Abject misery to bleed
Decadence to feed
Out damn spot outEmbed
