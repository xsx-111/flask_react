This Mortal Coil Lyrics
Tearing down the walls
Breaching frontiers
Unlocking the gates
To a new world disorder
A fresh balance of terror
The equilibrium of hate

Archaic nescience unleashed
Entrenched, a bitter legacy
Tempered in mental scars
All flesh entwined
In mortal equality

Tangled mortal coil

Twisted and warped
Tangled mortal coil
Tangled mortal coil

Tearing down the walls
Breaching frontiers
Unlocking the gates
To a new world disorder
A fresh balance of terror
The equilibrium of hate
Twisted and warped
Tangled mortal coilEmbed
