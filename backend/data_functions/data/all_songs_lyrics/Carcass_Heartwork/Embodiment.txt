Embodiment Lyrics
Bow down before your precious icon
Deity of self suppression
This effigy of flesh
Corporeal christi, nailed
In submission to this false idol
Seeking deliverance
From this spiritual hierarchy
Downward spiralling
A corrupt throne
Of repression and guilt

Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn

On my knees
Before this tormented flesh
In irreverence
In communion with this parasitic host
Of virtuous divinity
This imperious creed bears
Testament to the failures of our mortality
Righteous durance is our cross we
Bear in stations
In stations of the lost
Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn
Thy kingdom burn
Our will be done

From your knees arise
By your own hand
Your god you scribe
The earth shall
Inherit the meek
Your god is dead

Bound down in god we're trussed
Foul stature
Icons embodied in flesh we nail
In servitude to deities
Fashioned in our self image
Shadows of eternal strife
Cast by those who serve
A crown of pawns

Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn
Thy kingdom burn
Our will be done
From your knees arise
By your own hand
Your god you scribe
The earth shall
Inherit the meek
Your god is deadEmbed
