Buried Dreams Lyrics
Welcome, it's a world of hate
Your life of buried dreams
Smothered, by the soils of fate
Welcome, to a world of pain
Bitterness your only wealth
The sands of time kicked in your face
Rubbed in your face

When aspirations are squashed
When life's chances are lost
When all hope is gone
When expectations are quashed
When self esteem is lost
When ambition is mourned
All you need is hate

When aspirations are squashed
When life's chances are lost
When all hope is gone
When expectations are quashed
When self esteem is lost
When ambition is mourned
All you need is hate
In futility, for self preservation
We all need someone
Someone to hate


Welcome to a world of hate

When aspirations are squashed
When life's chances are lost
When all hope is gone
When expectations are quashed
When self esteem is lost
When ambition is mourned
All you need is hateEmbed
