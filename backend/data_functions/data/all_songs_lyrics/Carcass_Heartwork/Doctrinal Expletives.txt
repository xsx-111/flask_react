Doctrinal Expletives Lyrics
A play on words
Or words on play
Last chapter, verse
In the final act
Words well scripted
Each sentence choking
Inaudible gag
Blanket which suffocates

As you eat another's words
Malnourished, you starve

Silence has a definition
A vocabulary of muted diction
Precise thought to miscomprehend
Ambiguity in high resolution
Articulate expletive fiction
Open to misinterpretation
So precise

Silence has a definition
A vocabulary of muted diction
Articulate, expletive
Condensed meaning
Making no sense
Open mouth the lines
In stressed expression
Understand the silence
The piercing calm
Sour music to your ears

As you regurgitate another's words
In their shallowness you drown

Silence has a definition
A vocabulary of muted diction
Precise thought to miscomprehend
Ambiguity in high resolution
Articulate expletive fiction
Open to misinterpretation
So precise

Silence has a definition
A vocabulary of muted diction
Articulate, expletive
A play on words
Making no sense

Which makes no sense
Which makes none senseEmbed
