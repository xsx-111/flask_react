Carnal Forge Lyrics
Multifarious carnage
Meretriciously internecine
Sublime enmangling steelbath
Of escheated atrocities

Enigmatic longanimity
Of ruminent mass graves
Meritorious victory
Into body-bags now scraped...

Regnant fleshpiles
The dead regorged
Osculatory majestic wrath
This carnal forge

Desensitized - to perspicuous horror
Dehumanized - fresh cannon fodder...

Meritorious horror
Perspicuous onslaught
Dehumanized - cannon fodder
Killing sanitized
Slaughter sanctified
Desensitized - to genocide
Reigning corpsepiles
Death regorged
Sousing bloodbath
Carnage forged
In the cold, callous dignity of the mass grave

Multiferocious carnage
Cruel, mendacious creed
Sublime, murderous bloodbath
Of fiscal atrocities

Inexorable mettle
In redolent consomme
An opprobious crucible
Of molten human waste

Priapismic deathpiles
Infinitely regorged
The smelting butchery
Of the carnal forge

Desensitized - to pragmatic murder
Dehumanized - into cannon fodder...Embed
