Heartwork Lyrics
Works of art, painted black
Magniloquent, bleeding dark
Monotonous palate, murky spectrum
Grimly unlimited
Food for thought, so prolific
In contrasting shades forcely fed
Abstraction, so choking
So provocative

A canvas to paint
To degenerate
Dark reflections
Degeneration
A canvas to paint
To denigrate
Dark reflections
Of dark foul light

Profound, aesthetic beauty
Or shaded, sensary corruption
Perceptions, shattered
Splintered, mirroring
In deft taints, diluted, tinted
Spelt out, in impaired colour
Denigrating, to paint
Not a pretty picture
A canvas to paint
To degenerate
Dark reflections
Degeneration
A canvas to paint
To denigrate
Dark reflections
Of dark foul

Works of heart bleeding dark
Black, magniloquent art
Monotonous palate
Murky spectrum
Grimly unlimited
Prolific food for thought
Contrasting, fed with force
Abstraction, so choking
So provocative

Bleeding works of art
Seething work so dark
Searing words from the heart
A canvas to paint
To degenerate
Dark reflections
Degeneration
A canvas to paint
To denigrate
Dark reflections
Of dark foul
A canvas to paint
To degenerate
Dark reflections
Degeneration
A canvas to paint
To denigrate
Dark reflections
Of dark foul light3Embed
