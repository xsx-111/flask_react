Northern Soul LyricsWhat's your northern soul?
What's your neighbor called?
Do you know his name?
Does he even know that coupled lines will bend two leaves swimming in a pond
"If thou call'st for more"
Look within the works of Donne
Your form has slipped away
Come on discorporate
Got your northern soul
Got your shortened smile to behead the frame from the shade inside
Tapered lines that will bend
Two leaves swimming in a pond
The first to reach the shore is the first to leave the frond
Your form has slipped away
Come on discorporateEmbed
