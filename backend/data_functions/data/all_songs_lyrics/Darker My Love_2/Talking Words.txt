Talking Words LyricsBaby, you got me talking words, got me talking words, got me talking words
Baby, you got me meaning less, got me meaning less
Another day the rain
Don't you bring the rain
I can't think of one thought
That has tried to dry the day
Like the too tall man
Or a little hand
If destruction is your nature
Lay down and I'll be your father
Baby, you got me talking words, got me talking words, got me talking words
Baby, you got me meaning less, got me meaning less
Walking love suit black
When you took care of that
Got you way down here
To share the rain you gave right back
A box with a name
A mouth to give away
Please take care of what you're seeing
Pierced like an open ending
Baby, you got me talking words, got me talking words, got me talking words
Baby, you got me meaning less, got me meaning less
Another day the rain
Don't you bring the rain
I've become a falling drop
Among the waves and waves
Baby, you got me talking words, got me talking words, got me talking words
Baby, you got me meaning less, got me meaning lessEmbed
