Two Ways Out LyricsFirst I'm here
Then I'm there
And I know it's a drag
And I know it's a drag
But I'm here
So let's stress
All the things, that I say
All the things that I do
All the things I will tear
All the thoughts I will ruin
If something looks familiar
Looks familiar
Looks familiar
Then something is wrong
There is one thing you should know:
There's always two ways out
And my eyes
And my arms
And my legs are intact
And my mind, askew
Lost and unpacked
If something looks familiar
Looks familiar
Looks familiar
Then something is wrong
There is one thing you should know:
There's always two ways out
That's the worth when the world stops spinning on
Dark times are cut from different cloth
Are not the threads that we are made of
That we are made of
As I lay
In the grass
Knowing now
Things will pass
Now I know things will pass
So I glide on this moment in time
If something looks familiar
Looks familiar
Looks familiar
Then something is wrong
There is one thing you should know:
There's always two ways outEmbed
