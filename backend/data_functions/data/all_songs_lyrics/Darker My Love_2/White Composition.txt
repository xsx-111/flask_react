White Composition LyricsI tried to say what a monster would say
And I tried to say what it is I said today
Children and I you know we are the same and
With winks of an eye brings the drops of the rain
A baby blue for a white composition
Puts away things that are silent, hidden
Naps in the summertime
Tea in the winter time
I've wasted all my time
How does it end
I tried to say what a monster would say
And I tried to say what it is I said today
Head like a yo-yo that's spun all around
And the things that you do know are put in the ground
A baby blue for a white composition
Puts away things that are silent, hidden
Naps in the summertime
Tea in the winter time
I've wasted all my time
How does it end
Wait for my inheritance
I tried to say what a monster would say
And I tried to say what it is I said today
Children and I you know we are the same and
With winks of an eye brings the drops of the rain
A baby blue for a white composition
Puts away things that are silent, silent, silentEmbed
