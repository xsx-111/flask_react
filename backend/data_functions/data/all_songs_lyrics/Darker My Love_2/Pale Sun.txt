Pale Sun LyricsA father said to his son
"you should be waking up. Your salvation is here, your eyes will open up
All the times that I said you wouldn't understand, I meant them"
Wait forever to see the child locked inside everybody is free there is no need to hide
To deceive is to flee from the opened eye
So just turn around to face the pale sun
Sweeped across the silent morning
Shades of grey they won't wait for no one
So just turn around to face the pale sun
"to boast the sudden conquest of a foreign land to snuff the silver wasp
To waste the gifts of man and all the things that I said you didn't understand." said sir hexagram
So the son set out to find the twisting fan
Lifted from the bones lifted from the sand
Perched upon a gate he waits with bird in hand
So just turn around to face the pale sun
Sweeped across the silent morning
Shades of grey they won't wait for no one
So just turn around to face the pale sun
Cause we've heard rumors of new worlds forming
But we, place our selves with in the plot of the free and clearer mind where the light is caught
So just turn around to face the pale sun
Sweeped across the silent morning
Shades of grey they won't wait for no one
So just turn around to face the pale sunEmbed
