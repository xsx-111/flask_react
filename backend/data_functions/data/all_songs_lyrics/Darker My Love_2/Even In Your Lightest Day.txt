Even In Your Lightest Day LyricsEven in your lightest day
Still you wish you were behing your window
Clocks are running through the day, I'm just trying to get my daily wages
Saw a dog he said " I want more"
Think I know exactly what his name is
Sifting, drifting through the store, I'm a man who coughs a lot
Everything you are you have come so far
But did you bury your needs, in your own backyard
Anything you are you have come so far
But did you bury your needs, in your own backyardEmbed
