Blue Day LyricsFirst thing that you notice
Is the light across the floor
But when you live on all-four's
You want to close the door
No new reflection
That shines when you're alone
And all the time you lost
Will eat you more and more
And all the time you wanted
Doesn't want you anymore
In sand
Living man
Blue day
Blue day
Isn't it strange
When you see the new sun standing
With a head of cold
You split the coin to save it
In fear of growing lone
Took someone else's face
And vanished into air
And if you finish this
There's never ending stairs
And the cold you get
Will be the best arrest you've had
In sand
Living man
Blue day
Blue day
Isn't it strange
A change in your escape
Would turn the leaking head
A change in your escape
Will follow you to bed
In sand
Living man
Blue day
Blue day
Isn't it strange1Embed
