Immediate Undertaking LyricsThe lashes all are growing
To hide behind you
Enjoy moving people
Who wake before noon
Anger stars another
Open your eye
Take the off opinion
And start up your mouth
To shovel, is to want in
Welcome your way
There's a room to sell here
With forestry gates
Bone yard shakes and rattles
In time that you like
Take the off opinion
And wake before noon
And if one thing led to it all
Like the ones before you standing way too tall
Grab your ladder
Then you might avoid the fall
So steep
The two winds that are blowing
Are hiding in you
You know moving people
Who don't care for bloom
Good luck to the ryder
With compass and night
Take the off opinion
And scare off the day
And if one thing led to it all
The ones who fell beneath
The casting of the pall
Grab your ladder
Then you might avoid a fall
So steep
So steep
Then you notice the timeEmbed
