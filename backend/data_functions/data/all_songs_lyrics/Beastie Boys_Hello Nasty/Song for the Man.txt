Song for the Man LyricsI don't like your attitude, boy
What makes you feel
And why you gotta be
Like you got the right
To look her up and down?
What makes this world
So sick and evil?
I, I don't know
What makes you feel
Like you've got whip appeal?
Who made you the judge and jury?
Ain't you never heard of privacy?
What makes this world
So sick and evil?
You figure it out
You figure it out
You figure it outEmbed
