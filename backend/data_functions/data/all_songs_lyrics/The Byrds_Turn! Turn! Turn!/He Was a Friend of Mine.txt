He Was a Friend of Mine LyricsHe was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
His killing had no purpose
No reason, or rhyme
He was a friend of mine
He was in Dallas town
He was in Dallas town
Form a sixth floor window
A gunner shot him down
He died in Dallas town
He never knew my name
He never knew my name
Though I never met him
I knew him just the same
Oh, he was a friend of mine
Leader of a nation
For such a precious time
Oh, he was a friend of mineEmbed
