Oo You Lyrics
More guitar

Look like a woman
Dress like a lady, heh-heh
Talk like a baby, oo-hoo
Love like a woman, oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh

Ooh, ooh you
Ow!
Ooh you

Walk like a woman, oo-hoo
Sing like a blackbird, uh-huh
Eat like a hungry, woo-hoo
Cook like a woman, oo-hoo-woo-hoo-oo

Oo woman, oo-hoo
Ow!
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-hoo-hoo
Ooh you
Look like a woman, oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Dress like a lady, oo-hoo-ooh, oo-oo-ooh
Talk like a baby, golly-golly-golly-golly-goo-goo-ooh
Love like a woman, ooh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh

Ooh, ooh you
Daa-aah-ooh, oh-oo-ooh, oh-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oohEmbed
