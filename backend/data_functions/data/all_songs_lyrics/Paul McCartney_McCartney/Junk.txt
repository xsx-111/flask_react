Junk Lyrics
Motorcars, handlebars
Bicycles for two
Broken-hearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots
Sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree

"Buy! Buy!" says the sign in the shop window
"Why? Why?" says the junk in the yard

Da, da, ya, da, da, da
Da, da, da
Da, da, ya, da, da, da
Da, da, da

Candlesticks, building bricks
Something old and new
Memories for you and me

"Buy! Buy!" says the sign in the shop window
"Why? Why?" says the junk in the yard6Embed
