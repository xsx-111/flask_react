Every Night Lyrics
Every night, I just want to go out
Get out of my head
Every day, I don't want to get up
Get out of my bed
Every night, I want to play out
And every day, I want to do
But tonight I just want to stay in and be with you, ooh
And be with you

Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-hoo-ooh, mm-hmmh
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-hooh, mm-hmmh

Every day, I lean on a lamp post
I'm wasting my time
Every night, I lay on a pillow
I'm resting my mind
Every morning brings a new day
And every night, that day is through
But tonight I just want to stay in and be with you, ooh
And be with you
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-ooh, mm-hmmh, believe me mama
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, ah
Oo-ooh, mm-hmmh
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-hoo-ooh, mm-hmmhEmbed
