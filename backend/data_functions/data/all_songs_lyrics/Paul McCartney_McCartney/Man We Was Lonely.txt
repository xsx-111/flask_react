Man We Was Lonely Lyrics
Man, we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
And we was hard pressed to find a smile
Man, we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
But now we're fine all the while

I used to ride on my fast city line
Singing songs that I thought were mine alone (alone)
Alone
Now, let me lie with my love for the time
I am home (home)
Home (home)
Home

Man, we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
And we was hard pressed to find a smile
Man, we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
But now we're fine all the while
Now, let me lie with my love for the time
I am home (home)
Home (home)
Home
Man, we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
And we was hard pressed to find a smile
Man, we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
But now we're fine all the while

But now we're fine all the while
But now we're fine all the whileEmbed
