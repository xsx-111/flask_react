Teddy Boy Lyrics
This is the story of a boy named Ted
If his mother said, "Ted, be good", he would
She told him tales about his soldier dad
But it made her sad, then she'd cry, oh my

Ted used to tell her he'd be twice as good
And he knew he could, 'cause in his head he said

"Mommy don't worry, now teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mama don't worry, your teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"

Then came the day she found herself a man
Teddy turned and ran, far away, okay
He couldn't stand to see his mother in love with another man
He didn't know, oh no

He found a place where he could settle down
And from time to time, in his head he said
"Mommy don't worry, now teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mommy don't worry, your teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"

And she said, "Teddy don't worry, now mommy is here
Taking good care of you
Teddy don't worry, your mommy is here
Mommy's going to see you through"

This is the story of a boy named Ted
If his mother said, "Ted, be good", he would1Embed
