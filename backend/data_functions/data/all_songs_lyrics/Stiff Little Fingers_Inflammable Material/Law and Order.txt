Law and Order LyricsEverybody's down in the centre of town
We're doing nothing wrong we're only hanging around
And they put you up against the wall
Make loud mouth jokes just to make you feel small
Laugh at your appearance and the clothes you wear
Call that justice just isn't fair
I'm talking bout their law and order
They don't do what they ought to
Law and order
There's no justice in it
None
I had a friend who was lifted by the law
Lifted and shifted and dumped on the floor
They treated him like shit
Kicked him in the head and then laughed when he bled
Spat in his face and pulled his hair
Call that justice just isn't fair
I'm talking bout their law and order
They don't do what they ought to
Law and order
There's no justice in it
None
I'm not trying to say we're always right
No one's saying that it's black and white
All I'm saying is we don't agree
I don't think like you don't think like me
I hope you never do!
And that's the way they try and run this land
How they hold you down and keep you in hand
You're just a pawn in their game
You're just another number you ain't got a name
You're just a little punk y'know they don't care
Call that justice just isn't fair
I'm talking bout their law and order
They don't do what they ought to
Law and order
There's no justice in it
Law and order
They don't do what they ought to
Law and order
There's no justice in it
Law and order
They don't do what they ought to
Law and order
There's no justice in it
