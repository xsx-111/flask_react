Breakout LyricsAin't got no money but I don't give a damn
'Cos when I get it spend it fast as I can
Ain't got no worries at least none I can see
Got to make a fast connection then I'll be free
I gotta
Break out and leave this life behind
Break out and see what I can find
Might lose I'm going to try my luck
Might win don't really give a fuck
And I've gotta try 'cos I've gotta know
If I'm a winner and the star of the show
Can't stand routine for another day
Rules and regulations getting in my way
I've gotta
Break out and leave this life behind
Break out and see what I can find
Might lose I'm going to try my luck
Might win don't really give a fuck
And I won't let anyone put me down
I ain't gonna be nobody's clown
I won't be taken in by their promises, no
I'm gonna try on my terms this time
So if I can do it you can do it too
Why don't you try it you've got nothing to lose
A boring job living from day to day
Do something different try to break away
I've gotta
Break out and leave this life behind
Break out and see what I can find
Might lose I'm going to try my luck
Might win don't really give a fuck
I gotta
Break out and leave this life behind
Break out and see what I can find
Might lose I'm going to try my luck, and I
Might win don't really give a fuck
Break out!
Break out!
