White Noise LyricsRastus was a nigga, thug mugger junkie
Black golly gob, big horny monkey
Pimp pusher coon, grinning piccaninnies
Send him home soon, back to the trees!
Black wogs, black wogs
Your face don't fit
Black wogs, black wogs
You ain't no Brit!
Ahmed is a Paki, curry coffee queer
Ten to a bed, flocking over here
Tax-sponging canker, smelly thieving kids
Ponce greasy wanker, worse than the yids!
Brown wogs, brown wogs
Your face don't fit
Brown wogs, brown wogs
You ain't no Brit!
Stick together we'll be all right me and you
The only colours we need are red, white and blue
Paddy is a moron, spud thick Mick
Breeds like a rabbit, thinks with his pick
Anything floors him if he can't fight or drink it
Round them up in Ulster, tow it out and sink it!
Green wogs, green wogs
Our face don't fit
Green wogs, green wogs
We ain't no Brits!
If the victim ain't a soldier why should we care?
Irish bodies don't count, life's cheaper over there
Green wogs, green wogs
Face don't fit
Green wogs. Green wogs
We ain't no Brits
Green wogs, green wogs
Grab 'em boys
Green wogs, green wogs
Turn up the white noise
Turn up the white noise
Turn up the white noise!Embed
