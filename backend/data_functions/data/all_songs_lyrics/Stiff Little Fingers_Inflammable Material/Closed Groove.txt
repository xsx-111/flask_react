Closed Groove LyricsPunctuality waste of time
Now nostalgia is past its prime
History's a thing of the past
Being first just cannot last
Beep beep I'm an answering machine
I mean to say I say what I mean
Beep beep I've got very strong views
Plug in any loop tape you choose
My one single fault is modesty
I'm changing my views consistently
Amnesia's something I try to forget
Who can't kick gambling? Want to bet?
Beep beep I'm an answering machine
I mean to say I say what I mean
Beep beep I've got very strong views
Plug in any loop tape you choose
The case for racism is black and white
If you want world piece you've got to fight
Must do what you're told to be free
Think what you like - if you agree with me
Beep beep I'm an answering machine
I mean to say I say what I mean
Beep beep I've got very strong views
Plug in any loop tape you choose
Speak whenever you hear this tone
Speak whenever you hear this tone
Speak whenever you hear this tone
Speak whenever you hear this tone
Speak whenever you hear this tone
Speak whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this tone
Scream whenever you hear this toneEmbed
