State of Emergency LyricsYou're looking for something
But what could that be?
You look for a hero
You don't look at me
You looking around yourself
There's nothing you can find
You look for solutions
But hate has made you blind
You keep looking around you
For something that's in your mind
And you've spent the last ten years of your life
In this emergency
So please don't just sit there
Let's try to break out
From all the hatred
Suspicion and doubt
Try to change your life that is no life at all
Try to break down the imaginary wall
And if you couldn't be bothered
Well then, my friend, you'll fall
And spend all the rest of your life
In this emergency
Dial 999! It's an emergency!
One, two, three, four!Embed
