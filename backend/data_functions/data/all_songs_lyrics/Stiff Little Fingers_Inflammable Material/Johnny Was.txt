Johnny Was LyricsWoman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
From a stray bullet
Woman hold her head and cry
Accompanying her was a passerby
Who saw the woman cry
Wondering can she work it out
Now she knows that the wages of sin is death
The gift of God is life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Johnny was a good man
Oh yeah
Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Just because of the system
Woman hold her head and cry
Comforting her I was passing by
And I, I saw the woman cry
She cried, oh, oh, oh, oh
Johnny was a good man
Never did a thing wrong
No!
Take it down
Johnny went out on a Saturday night
Never hurt anybody never started no bar room fight
Johnny never did nobody no wrong
Never hurt anybody never hurt anybody
Johnny was a good man
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Johnny was a good, Johnny was a good man
I tell you Johnny was a good man
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Was a good man
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny was a good man
On a top floor flat in the middle of the night
There's a man with rifle and Johnny in his sight
I said oh no, no, no, no, no, no we can't let that kind of thing happen here no more
Oh no
...Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
A single shot rings out in a Belfast night and I said oh
Johnny was a good man
Johnny was a good man
Johnny was a good man
Johnny was a good man
Johnny was a good man
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Can a woman's tender care
Cease towards the child she bears? Oh
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, yeah!
Too little Johnnys, too little Johnnys, too little Johnnys
Run while you can!Embed
