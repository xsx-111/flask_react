Suspect Device LyricsInflammable material planted in my head
It's a suspect device that's left 2000 dead
Their solutions are our problems
They put up the wall
On each side time and prime us
Make sure we get fuck all
They play their games of power
They cut and mark the pack
They deal us to the bottom
But what do they put back?
Don't believe them
Don't believe them
Don't be bitten twice
You gotta suss, suss, suss, suss, suss, suss
Suss suspect device
They take away our freedom
In the name of liberty
Why can't they all just clear off?
Why can't they let us be?
They make us feel indebted
For saving us from Hell
And then they put us through it
It's time the bastards fell
Don't believe them
Don't believe them
Don't be bitten twice
You gotta suss, suss, suss, suss, suss, suss
Suss suspect device
Don't believe them
Don't believe them
I tell you question everything you're told
Just take a look around you
At the bitterness and spite
Why can't we take over
And try to put it right?
Please don't believe us
Don't believe us
Don't be bitten twice
You gotta suss, suss, suss, suss, suss, suss
Suss suspect device
We're a suspect device if we do what we are told
But a suspect device can score an own goal
I'm a suspect device the Army can't defuse
You're a suspect device they know they can't refuse
We're gonna blow up in their faceEmbed
