No More of That LyricsThey never ask us if we want a war
Who do they think they are talkin' for?
'Cos we never get no say
They have to do it all their way
Say oh, we want no more of that
You can't push us under the mat
Oh, we want no more of that
The man who pulls the trigger's not to blame
He's only playing their deadly game
And he knows he just can't win
Or someone else will pull the trigger for him
Say oh, we want no more of that
You can't push us under the mat
Oh, we want no more of that
They go inside where we can't see
They play their games of hypocrisy
They go inside, we've got no choice
It's our body, but it's their voice
Say oh, we want no more of that
You can't push us under the mat
Oh, we want no more of that
The man who pulls the trigger's not to blame
He's only playing their deadly game
And he knows he just can't win
Or someone else will pull the trigger for him
I said oh, we want no more of that
You can't push us under the mat
Oh, we want no more of that
No, we want no more of that
You can't push us under the mat
Oh, we want no more of that
I said no, we want no more of that
You can't push us under the mat
Oh, we want no more of thatEmbed
