Rough Trade LyricsRecord boss said we would be a smash
Yeah, go straight to number one
He talked of hits and tours and lots of cash
And all the time it wasn't on
And I believed every word he said
And I swallowed every line
Yeah I believed every word was true
And I didn't find out in time
We were betrayed, betrayed, betrayed
Betrayed, betrayed by Rough Trade lies
Betrayed by lies!
We quit our jobs and got all set to fly
Your promises had us riding high
And it's a dirty rough tough trade we find
"Yeah we agreed, but they hadn't signed
Sorry, son, gonna have to throw you
Our lawyers say we don't even know you"
Music is money, kids are no-account fools
You trade in us, we get betrayed by you
We were betrayed, betrayed, betrayed
Betrayed, betrayed by Rough Trade lies
Betrayed by lies!
And you're sitting there
In you're London office snug and warm
And you think that you've won
But remember this is just round one
We're gonna do it our way
We're gonna make it on our own
Because we've found people to trust
People who put music first
Won't be betrayed, betrayed, betrayed
Won't be betrayed no more
No lies no more!
Why can't you tell us the truth?
Why can't you tell us the truth? (Why did you lie to us?)
Why can't you tell us the truth? (Why did you lie to us?)
Why did you lie to us? Why did you lie to us?
Why did you lie to us? Why did you lie to us?
Why did you tell us your lies?Embed
