Barbed Wire Love Lyrics
I met you in No Man's Land
Across the wire, we were holding hands
Hearts a-bubble in the rubble
It was love at bomb site

But all you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love
Barbed wire love
Barbed wire love

When I fell, it was awful nice
Caught when not suspecting vice
The night was rife with wasteland life
You set my arm alight

(Ooh) All you give me is barbed wire love (Do-do-do-do)
(Ooh) All caught up in barbed wire love (Do-do-do-do)
(Ooh) Tangled up in barbed wire love (Do-do-do-do)
(Ooh) Throw my leg over barbed wire love (Do-do-do-do)
(Ooh) Barbed wire love (ooh, ooh, ooh) snags my jeans
Barb, barb, barb, barbed wire love
Barb, barb, barb, barbed wire love
Barb, barb, barb, barbed wire love
Barb, barb, barb, barb wire, barbed wire love
Barbed wire love
Barbed wire love

Blasted by your booby traps
I felt the blow in both knee-caps
Your eyes did shine, your lips were fine
The device in your pants was out of sight

But nothing really matters because
All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
And barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love
Barbed wire love
Barbed wire love
Barbed wire loveEmbed
