78 RPM Lyrics69 it was fine you say
But by 79 it's gonna be mine I say
71 rang the knell
72 we went through hell
73 & 74 only gave us more
Bloody bloody bloody bore
But now its here
Our new year
It's gonna be
78 revolutions a minute
78 revolutions a minute now
75 the same old jive
Christ will you tell me why we're still alive
76 no kick you bet
But no way we ain't dead yet
But now its here gonna be
78 revolutions a minute
78 revolutions a minute now
It got better in 77
You say god know it weren't heaven
Stuff it we know it weren't no revel
Weren't no revel revel revel revolution
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8
Make up you mind drive you blind gonna be
78 revolutions a minute
78 revolutions a minute now
I said now, I mean now, not tomorrow, do it nowEmbed
