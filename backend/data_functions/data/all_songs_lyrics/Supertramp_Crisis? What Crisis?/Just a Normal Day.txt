Just a Normal Day Lyrics
Ooh, woke up crying
With a break of dawning;
I looked out at the sky
The air was still
Yet all the leaves were falling
Can you tell me why?

Well, I just don't know the reason
I don't know what to say;
It just seems a normal day
And I've got to live my own life;
I just can't spare the time
'Cause you've got strange things on your mind

Well, I just feel
That ev'ry minute's wasted;
My life is unreal
And anyway
I guess I'm, I'm just not rated
Leastwise, that's how I feel

Well I just don't know the reason
I don't know what to say;
It just seems a normal day
And I've got to live my own life;
I just can't spare the time
You've got strange things on your mind
I eat a lot
Sleep a lot
Passing the time of day;
Maybe I'll find my way
Who am I kidding?
Yes, it's just myself2Embed
