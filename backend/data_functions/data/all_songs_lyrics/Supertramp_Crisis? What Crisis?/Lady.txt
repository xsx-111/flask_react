Lady Lyrics
Lady, you're comin' 'cross the water
Well, don't you think you oughta
Be waiting a while?

Are you acting
On what your heart has told you;
Is nothing gonna hold you
From flying away? Ah ha

Flying away, ah ha
Flying away

'Cause there's nowhere to go
Though the road is outstretched before you
And the farther you go
I said ain't nothin' gonna get you to heaven
I said ain't nothin' gonna get you to heaven
And you know just who you are
And you know that there's somethin' between us
And you like what you feel
But I can tell that you're not gonna turn back
Well, I can tell that you're not gonna turn back
And don't you know I'm a little bit sad? Oh no
Ooh la la la la
Ooh la la la la
Ooh la la la la
Ooh la la la la
Aah, aah, aah

Mister, you better get a move on
You better get a fix on
You better walk straight

I said Lady
Oh take me if you want me;
Won't you take me as you find me?
Oh, I'm needing your love so bad

I'm needing your love so bad
I'm needing your love

And there's nowhere to go
Though the road is outstretched before you
And the farther you go
I said ain't nothin' gonna get you to heaven
I said ain't nothin' gonna get you to heaven
And you know just who you are
And you know that there's somethin' between us
And you like what you feel
But I can tell that you're not gonna turn back
Well, I can tell that you're not gonna turn back
And don't you know I'm a little bit sad?

Ooh la la la la
Ooh la la la la
Ooh la la la la
Ooh la la la la
Aah, aah, aah
Just a little bit sad
Just a little bit sad
You're takin' the long way
She's turnin' about
