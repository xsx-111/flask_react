A Soapbox Opera Lyrics...I want to tell you something, listen to me! I'm trying to say I'm better than you, I am only what I am...
We must not stand still
For the night is coming
Every man, every woman and child
Everybody help me...
I hear only what I want to hear
But I have to believe in something
Have to believe just one thing
I said, Father Washington, you're all mixed up
Collecting sinners in an old tin cup
Spare a listen for a restless fool
There's something missing when I read your rules
Well hey there, you tell me you're a holy man
But although I am just a beginner
I don't see you as a winner
I said, Sister Robinson, you're all washed up
Collecting teardrops in a paper cup
If I could tell you what you need to know
If I could help you to get on with the show
But Reverend Ebenezer, there's a storm in my head
Makes me believe what you said just wasn't true
So what am I to do?
(Well, what is he to do?)
Oh, what is there to do?
Whoa, whoa, whoa
...All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The lord God made them all...
Mary, tell me what I'm living for
'Cause I feel like I'm tossed in the river
Have you a son to deliver?
I say, Father Washington, you're all mixed up
Collecting sinners in an old tin cup
You tell the children what they need to know
But will they listen when it's time to go?
Oh, Sister Robinson, you're all washed up
Collecting teardrops in a paper cup
Can someone tell me what I need to know?
Can someone help me to get on with the show?Embed
