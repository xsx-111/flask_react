Easy Does It LyricsAnd if my thoughts had wings
I'd be the bird that sings
I'd fly where love isn't shy
And everyone is willing to try
And if we had the time
And time's so hard to find
I could believe what you say
Start sending those shadows away
And if you know who you are
You are your own superstar
And only you can shape the movie that you make
So when the lights disappear
And only the silence is here
Watch yourself, easy does it, easy does it, easy while you wake
And if you know who you are
You are your own superstar
And only you can shape the music that you make
So when the crowds disappear
And only the silence is near
Watch yourself, easy does it, easy does it, easy while you wakeEmbed
