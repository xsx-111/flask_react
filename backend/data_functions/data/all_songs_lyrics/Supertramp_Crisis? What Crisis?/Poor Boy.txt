Poor Boy LyricsCan you believe me when I say
There's nothin' I'd like better
Than just to sit here and talk with you?
Although I'll rant and I'll rave
About one thing and another
The beauty of it is (hope you'll agree)
Though I'm a poor boy
I can still be happy
As long as I can feel free
So many people I know gettin' old way too early
(Well, are you feelin' kind of weary?)
Just to impress you with the money they've made
(You'd better, you'd better, you'd better change your theory.)
One drop of rain they complain
And it's the same about the wage they're earnin'
Well that is not the way I'm gonna be
Don't mind the rain
Don't mind snow
Don't mind nothin'
If I know
You will be right here with me
Well let us state our only point of view
Why can't we all afford to live like you?
This simple life is simply not enough
We have appearances we must keep up
Poor boy
If that's the way it's gotta be (Poor boy)
It's you for you and me for me
I try all I can understanding all the fools
And all their money
When half of what they got
You know they never will use
Enough to get by suits me fine;
I don't care if they think I'm funny
I'm never gonna change my point of view
Don't mind the rain
Don't mind snow
Don't mind nothin'
If I know
You will be right here with me
Always â€“ na, na, na
Don't mind the rain
Don't mind snow
Don't mind nothin'
If I know
You will be right here with meEmbed
