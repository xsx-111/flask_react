Sister Moonshine LyricsOh, when I was a small boy
Well, I could see the magic in a day
Oh, but now I'm just a poor boy;
Well maybe it's the price you have to pay
If you lock your dreams away
If no-one wants to listen
What's the story?
I wish I'd been a minstrel
Just think of all the maidens I'd recall
Oh, I wish I'd been a gypsy
Then maybe I could read the crystal ball
'Cause surrounded by these walls
Just makes me feel uneasy
I said: Hey, Sister Moonshine
Won't you send me a little sun?
I said: Hey, Sister Moonshine
I'm a stranger to ev'ryone
So make us all laugh, make us all cry
Make us all give, make us all try
Give us the secret show us the lie
We'll strike up the music and light up the sky
Oh, if I was a lion
Well I could be the king of all the plain
Oh, and if I was an eagle
Well maybe I could fly above the rain
Fly above the pain
But I know I'm only fooling
I said: Hey, Sister Moonshine
Won't you send me a little sun?
I said: Hey, Sister Moonshine
I'm a stranger to ev'ryone
Make us all laugh, make us all cry
Make us all give, make us all try
Give us the secret show us the light
We'll strike up the music and light up the sky
I said: Hey Sister Moonshine
I said: Hey Sister Moonshine
