Brazil LyricsBrazil - when stars were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured someday soon
We kissed and clung together
Then - tomorrow was another day
The morning found us miles away
With still a million things to say
And now when twilight dims the skies above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I am certain of
Return ' I will ' to old Brazil
