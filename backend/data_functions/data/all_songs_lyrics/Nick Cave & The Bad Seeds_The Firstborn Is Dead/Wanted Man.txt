Wanted Man LyricsI'm a wanted man, wanted man...
I'm wanted, I'm a wanted man...
Oh yeah...
Yeah...
Ah honey, I'm a wanted man
I'm a wanted man in California
I'm a wanted man in Buffalo
I'm a wanted man in Kansas City
I'm a wanted man in Ohio
I'm a wanted man in Mississippi
They want me in old Cheyenne
Wherever you may look tonight
You will see this wanted man
I might be in Colorado or Georgia by the sea
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
If you ever see me comin' and you know just a who I am
Don't breathe a word to no one buddy, cause I'm a wanted man
Wanted man in Albuquerque
Wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee
Wanted man in Baton Rouge
Wanted man in Arizona
Wanted man in Galveston
Wanted man in El Dorado
This wanted man's in great demand
If you ever catch me sleepin'
Just see the price flashin' 'bove my head
Well take look again my friend
That's a gun pointed at your head
Wanted man by Lucy Watson
Wanted man by Jesse Brown
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson
Wanted man in this next town
Wanted man by the Boller Sisters
Wanted man by Kid Callahan
Hey Darlin' don't you tell me you don't want me
Cause I'm a wanted man
A wanted man who's lost his will to live
A wanted man who won't lay down
There's a woman kneelin' on my grave
Pushin' daisies in the ground
Wanted man in the Windy City
Wanted man in Tennessee
Wanted man in Broken Arrow
Wanted man in Wounded Knee
Wanted man in Jackson Town
Wanted man in El Paso
I got bounties on my head in towns
I wouldn't ever think to go
Wanted Man in Arizona
Wanted man in Louisville
Wanted man deep in Death Valley
Wanted man up in the Hollywood Hill
If the Devil comes collectin'
Cause he doesn't know I'm a wanted man
He'd better wear a six gun on his hip
And hold another in his hand
If you love the wanted man
You best hold him while you can
Cause you're gonna wake up one mornin'
And find the man you wanted, he is gone
Wanted man in New York City
Wanted man in San Anton'
Wanted man down in Laredo
Wanted man in Tupelo
Wanted man in the state of Texas
Wanted man in the state of Maine
This wanted man's in the state of leavin' ya baby
Jumpin' on a midnight train
Wanted man in every cat house
Wanted man in a many saloons
Wanted man is a ghost in hundred homes
A shadow in a thousand rooms
Wanted man down in St. Louis
Wanted man in New Orleans
Wanted man in Mussel Bay
Wanted man in Cripple Creek
Wanted man in Detroit City
Wanted man in San Anton'
But there's one place I'm not wanted lord
It's the place that I call home
Wanted man...
Wanted man...
If the devil comes collectin'
He better hold a six gun in his hand1Embed
