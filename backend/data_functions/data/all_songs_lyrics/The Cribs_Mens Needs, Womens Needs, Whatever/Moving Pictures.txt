Moving Pictures LyricsYou'll sleep tonight
Dream dreams where I would die
It's alright, it's alright
They did not come true
Although they will do, in time
It's alright, it's alright
Fakes, liars and stars of moving pictures
What's the difference?
Like all the parts that I'm not into
But I see in you
Not real brown eyes look into mine
But I was so shy
It's alright
You'll sleep tonight
Dream dreams where I would die
It's alright, it's alright
Fakes, liars and stars of moving pictures
What's the difference?
Like all the parts that I'm not into
But I see in you
Guarded thoughts
Firing off
Parting shots
Missing lots
Liars, fakes and stars of moving pictures
What's the difference?
Like all the parts that I'm not into
But I see in youEmbed
