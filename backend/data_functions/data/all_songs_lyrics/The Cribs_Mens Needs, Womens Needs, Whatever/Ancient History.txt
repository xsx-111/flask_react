Ancient History LyricsLaid my cards on the table
So she could see the light
My efforts went wasted
Due to fallen night
And I know...
But by the end of the evening
I was in no doubt
Of all of the things
That you could live without
And I know...
I drag up ancient history
Hope that they'll forgive me
They had nothing but ego's
But they would multiply
All of the reasons that i would try
That I know...
To be making it harder to be seen but, oh
Is it too much to ask for to be left alone?
Yeah, I know...
I drag up ancient history
Hope that they'll forgive me
Laid my cards on the table
So she could see the light
My efforts went wasted
Due to fallen night
And I know...
I drag up ancient history
Hope that they'll forgive me
