My Life Flashed Before My Eyes LyricsThe wrong time, the wrong place
Your talent scouts my lonely face
Of all the things I can't replace
Your talent scouts my lonely face
Well it's alright, although I know you lied
I don't mind
It's alright, although i know you lied
I don't mind
The wrong time, the wrong place
Your talent scouts my lonely face
Of all the things I can't escape
Your talent scouts my lonely face
Well I'm alright, although I know you lied
I don't mind
If my life flashed before my eyes
Do you think I'd mind?
No...
And now, you don't need mine
You let us down
You watched us die
Now, I hang around
With people I don't even know1Embed
