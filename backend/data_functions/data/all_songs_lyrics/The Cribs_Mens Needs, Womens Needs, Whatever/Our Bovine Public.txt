Our Bovine Public LyricsDidn't think I'd have to choose
Didn't think I'd wear brown shoes
Didn't think that I'd ever have to read about this in the news
You're gonna have a go?
Well I don't want to know
I just thought that I should try and say hello to those who'd
Never exist without being generic
You're out to impress our bovine public
You'd never exist if you wasn't generic
You're out to impress our bovine public
I'll never forget how all this begun
And I will never regret a thing I have done
But you would never exist without us so maybe I do...
...not have the time, fairweather friends of mine
A years a long time when you’re doing nothing with your life
I heard you felt alert?
Well I’m hoping that it hurt
‘Cos we spent too much time doing groundwork to be ground Into the dirt by those who’d
Never exist without being generic
You’re out to impress our bovine public
You’d never exist if you wasn’t generic
You’re out to impress our bovine public
I’ll never forget how all this begun
And I will never regret a thing I have done
But you would never exist without us so maybe I do…
You say nothing
So you’ll always mean nothing to me
And if what you say means nothing
Then what you say will always mean nothing to me
Didn’t think I’d have the time, fairweather friends of mine
A years a long time when you’re doing nothing with your life
I heard you felt alert?
Well I’m hoping that it hurt
‘Cos we spent too much time doing groundwork to be ground Into the dirt by those who’d
Never exist without being generic
You’re out to impress our bovine public
You’d never exist if you wasn’t generic
You’re out to impress our bovine public
I’ll never forget how all this begun
And I will regret not one thing I’ve done
But you would never exist without us so maybe I do…Embed
