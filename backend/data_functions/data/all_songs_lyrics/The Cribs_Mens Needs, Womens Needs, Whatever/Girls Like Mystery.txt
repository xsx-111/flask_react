Girls Like Mystery LyricsThere's not much to say for me
That's OK, you know that girls like mystery
They'll know all the things I've had
That's OK, it don't necessarily make you bad
Leave me alone, I'm just your enemy
I've seen it all, I've seen your jealousy
They said they'd love me til the end
Now they just see me as a friend
We leave a lot to be desired
I don't care if I'm desired
They said they'd love me til the end
Now they just see me as a friend
We leave a lot to be desired
I never want to be desired
There's not much to say for me
That's OK, you know that girls like mystery
Keep your clothes lose your dignity
After all, it's only two years history
Leave me alone, I'm just your enemy
I've seen it all, I've seen your jealousy
They said they'd love me till the end
Now they just see me as a friend
We leave a lot to be desired
I don't care if I'm desired
They said they'd love me till the end
They just see me as a friend
We leave a lot to be desired
I never want to be desiredEmbed
