Nashville 1972 Lyrics
I had a dog named Banjo and a girl named Muffin
I'd blew in from Texas, I didn't know nothin'
But I found my way around this town with a friend I'd made named Guy
Who loved Susanna and so did I

Now there was this run-down shack on Acklen Avenue that I shared with Skinny Dennis
And a poet, name of Richard Dobson who had a novel he'd never finished
And that's when Johnny Rodriguez, David Olney, and Steve Earle first came through
And every other guitar bum whose name I never knew

Old school Nashville
Harlan Howard, Bob McDill
Tom T. Hall go drink your fill
And blow us all away

There was this tight-rope walker who called herself the Queen of Poughkeepsie
Who ran away from the circus with this roustabout redneck gypsy
They were Townes Van Zandt fans and prone to combustion
They fought like dogs in Spanish and made love in Russian

I wish Newberry and Buck White
Would drop on by the house tonight
Things have changed around here, you bet
But it don't seem much better yet
I first met Willie Nelson with some friends at a party
I was twenty-two, yeah so, and he must have been pushing forty
Now there was hippies and reefer and God knows what all, I was drinking pretty hard
I played him this shitty song I wrote then puked out in the yard

Old school Nashville
Harlan Howard, Bob McDill
Tom T. Hall, go drink your fill
And blow us all away

Tom T. Hall, go drink your fill
And blow us all awayEmbed
