Forgive Me Annabelle Lyrics
Maybe I was out of line, but mostly I was out of touch
You lean on anger like a crutch, you’re bound to take a fall
No doubt I was slow to learn, I just couldn’t get the gist
So I doubled up my fist and I punched me the wall

When you walked out on me I took the hit in stride
I’m better off I lied
The truth may show I stood the blow
But we both know how far from grace I fell
Forgive me Annabelle

Who’d have thought that peace of mind would find me in the end
Nearly ten years on the mend and no getting over you
But now I’m resolute, I’ve seen evidence of change
At first I thought it strange and not worth clinging to

Let's set the record straight
I came around too late
Though I got there in the end
I never was your friend

When you walked out on me, it tore my heart in half
And I hid behind a laugh
As I became a slave to shame I cursed your name
God Damn you, rot in Hell
Can you forgive me AnnabelleEmbed
