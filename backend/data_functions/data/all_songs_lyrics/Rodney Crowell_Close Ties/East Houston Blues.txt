East Houston Blues Lyrics
So I grew up hungry
And I grew up hard
Took the streets and alleys
For my own backyard
I got a break and enter
On my list of crimes
Been before the judge
One too many times

East Houston Blues
Scale of one to ten
About a nine and a half
Is where it's always been
It's in the drinking water
And in the bar ditch mud
East Houston Blues
Gets in a poor boy's blood

I learned to drink and drive
When I was twelve years old
My uncle Fireball Stoddard
Rest his ragged soul
He run a '54 Ford
Up and down the drag
Sipping Early Times
Straight from a paper bag
East Houston Blues
Picture Dowling Street
And Navigation Boulevard
Where the crossroads meet
Three sheets in the wind
Brick shy of a load
East Houston Blues
Down a nowhere road

Forty dollar boots
Big Bangora hat
Stolen money from an inside job
Maybe think about that

I'm a Third Ward child
My mother's only son
Which means exactly nothing
Without a loaded gun
I don't believe in love
This I guarantee
If there's a God above
He's got it in for me
East Houston Blues
What you want me to say?
I need to find me a woman
To keep the wolves at bay
Keep my head on straight
Make me toe the line
East Houston Blues
Ain't no friend of mine

So you understand
That of which I speak
I'm a worried man
On a losing streakEmbed
