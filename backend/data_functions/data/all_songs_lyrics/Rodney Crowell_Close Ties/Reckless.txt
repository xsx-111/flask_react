Reckless Lyrics
Last night I lay dreaming I was drinking in a hotel bar
Two women came up and kissed me
And you were watching from a distant star
I know it doesn’t make much sense, but what can I tell you
Judging by the evidence, I’m feeling reckless

I don’t know why I would go there, all to make a fuss over what
I’ve got a woman like you and what do I do
Pretend I might be something I’m not
I know you know it’s not your fault, it’s just something inside me
Would that I were worth my salt, but I’m feeling reckless

You give me more than I deserve
You could say I’ve got some nerve

So slay me with your tender mercy
Comfort me with words of steel
You can catch me in a lie when I cast a roving eye
But you’ll never know the way I feel
I know you know you’re smarter than me
Tell me something I don’t know
There’s so much more that I could be, but I’m feeling reckless
Last night I lay dreaming I was drinking in a hotel bar
Two women came up and kissed me
And you were watching from a distant starEmbed
