Always Never Lyrics
I feel no pain
'Cause I'm an island
I will remain
In the deafness of your silence

I love you sometimes
Always never
He said you're here
Here with me now

I feel no gain
When you're around me
I'll try again
In the darkness you astound me

I love you sometimes
Always never
He said you're here
Here with me now
I love you sometimes
Always never
He said you're here
Here with me now
It's growing cold
I'm growing old
Is this the only way to see the fire?
It's rainingEmbed
