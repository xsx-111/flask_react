Dislocated Day Lyrics
A dislocated day
Peers in to the ether
Counts the stars inside the sky
And flies in to the never
Looped around my eyelids
A thousand shining flecks
Pale against the canvas
Which hangs around my neck

Dislocated day
I will find a way
To make you say
The name of your forgiver

Stood beside an inlet
A starfish leads a dance
It dreams it is a human
And falls into a trance

Dislocated day
I will find a way
To make you say
The name of your forgiver
A hole inside my body
Is wired up to a charge
Chemical imbalance
Tells me who you are
Insects hide the silence
November brings deep rain
Between the flow to freezing
And yesterday's sustain

Dislocated day
I will find a way
To make you say
The name of your forgiverEmbed
