The Moon Touches Your Shoulder LyricsSpringtime is over
Don't head for home
Creep up the ladder
And steal over stone
No time to forget this
World's in your eyes
Sway in the cloud blur
And light up the sky
Clue, ah
I will
Moonloop, I
Cast off the colour
And tune in to black
The moon touches your shoulder
And brings the day back
Touches your window, touches your window
Touches your windowEmbed
