Radioactive Toy LyricsRun through forests on a hot Summer day
Trying to break down walls of numbing pain
Give me the freedom to destroy
Give me radioactive toy
Taste the water from a stream of running death
Eat the apple and cough a dying breath
Give me the freedom to destroy
Give me radioactive toy
Feel the sun burning through your black skin
Pour me into a hole, inform my next of kin
Give me the freedom to destroy
Give me radioactive toy
Run through graveyards on a dusty Winter day
Spit the dirt out and try to say
Give me the freedom to destroy
Give me radioactive toyEmbed
