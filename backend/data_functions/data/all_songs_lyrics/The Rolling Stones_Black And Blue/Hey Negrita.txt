Hey Negrita Lyrics
Hey Negrita, hey now
Move your body, move your mouth
Shake lady, the way down south
Shake baby, in your home town

Como se llama, what's your game?
I'm just a poor man, what's your name?
Shake your body, do it up now
Shake body, move it up now

Hey Negrita, hey now
Hey conchita, shake it up now
Ah yeah, do it up now
Mueve las caderas, do it up now

Flash of gold in your ears, child
Flash of gold in your eyes
Saw the gleam in your mouth
Saw the steel in your thighs

Do it up now
Bate las caderas, do it up now
Just a momentita, not so fast
I need money, my sweet ass
I said "Listen I'm a poor man, my pay is low
Here's one last dollar, then we go
"One last dollar," she says "I got my pride"
Going to get your boss, boy, going to tan your hides

Hey Negrita, hey now
Hey Negrita, do it right now
Come on boys


Shake it up! Shake it up!
Hey Negrita, hey now
Hey Negrita, hey now
Hey Negrita, hey now
Hey Negrita, hey now
Hey Negrita, hey now
Hey Negrita, hey now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey1Embed
