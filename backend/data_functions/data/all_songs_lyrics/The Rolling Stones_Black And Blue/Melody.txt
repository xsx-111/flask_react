Melody Lyrics
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name

Came home one morning about quarter to three
I'm banging on my door because I just lost my key
Open up, baby, you got someone else inside
I'm going to come get you, dead or alive

Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name

I took her out dancing but she drank away my cash
She said, "I'm going to fix my face don't you worry I'll be back"
I'm looking for her high and low like a mustard for a ham
She was crashed out in the bathroom in the arms of my best friend

Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Then one day she left me, she took everything that moved
My car, she took my trailer home, she took my Sunday boots
My nose is on her trail, I'm going to catch her by surprise
Then I'm going to have the pleasure to roast that child alive

WhatI say? It was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
It was her second name
It was her second name
Melody was her second name
Melody was her second name
That sweet sweet sweet baby
Baby
Baby, baby
Baby
Melody
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
Melody (Melody), it was her second name
