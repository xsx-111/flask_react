Cherry Oh Baby Lyrics
Oh, Cherry, oh Cherry, oh baby
Don't you know I'm in need of thee
You don't believe it's true
Why don't you love me, too
It's so long I been waiting
For you to come right in
Now that we are together
Is makin' my joy run over

Whoa, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo
Whoa, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh Cherry, oh Cherry, oh baby
Don't you know I'm in love with you
You don't believe I know
So why don't you try me
I'm never going to let you down
Never make you wear no frown
You say you love me madly
Then why do you treat me badly
Whoa, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo
Whoa, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo
Yeeeaah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeeeaah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh Cherry, oh Cherry, oh baby
Don't you know I'm in love with you
You don't believe I know
So why don't you try me
I'm never going to let you down
Never make you wear no frown
You say you love me madly
Then why do you treat me badly

Whoa, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo
Whoa, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo, eeyo
Yeeeaah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeeeaah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
