Crazy Mama Lyrics
Well you're crazy Mama
With your ball and chain
And your sawn off shotgun
Your blown out brains, yeah

You can scandalize me
Scorn my name
You can steal my money
And that don't mean a doggone thing

'Cause if you really think you can push it
I'm going to bust your knees with a bullet
You're crazy mama, ah yeah

Well your old time religion
Is just a superstition
You going to pay high prices
For your sacrifices, ah yeah

Well your blood and thunder
Sure can't phase me none
If you're going to keep on coming
I'm going to take it all head on
If you don't believe I'm going to do it
Just wait until you get hit by that bullet
Crazy mama, ah yeah
I'm coming at ya, getcha boy

Ah don't think I ain't thought about it
It sure makes my shackles rise
And cold blood murder
Make me want to draw the line, yeah
Woo yeah

Well you're crazy mama
With your ball and chain
You're plain psychotic, woo
Plain insane

If you don't believe I'm gonna do it
Just wait for the thud of the bullet
Crazy mama, ah yeah

Ah, you're crazy, mama yeah
Ah, you're crazy, mama yeahEmbed
