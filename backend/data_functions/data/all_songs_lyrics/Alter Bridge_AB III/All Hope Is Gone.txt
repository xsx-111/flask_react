All Hope Is Gone LyricsA tireless stream of indifference flows
Through veins 'till the river runs dry
I no longer care, I have all but disposed
Of dreams that I once held inside
Desire is gone after all of the years
The fight has been lost, I concede
The apathy born a long time ago
Has grown to what I can't defeat
Chorus:
I've been here too long
I'm tired, longing for more
How long must I run
To find what I'm looking for?
All hope is gone
The sadness I carry so deep in my heart
Of what could have been and might be
Is never forgotten, it's never too far
I'm wasted so worn and so weak
Chorus:
I've been here too long
I'm tired, longing for more
How long must I run
To find what I'm looking for?
All hope is gone
I've been here too long
I'm tired, longing for more
How long must I run
To find what I'm looking for?
I've been here too long
I'm tired, longing for more
All hope is gone
All hope is gone
All hope is goneEmbed
