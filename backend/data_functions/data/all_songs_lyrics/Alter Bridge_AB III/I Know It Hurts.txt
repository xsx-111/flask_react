I Know It Hurts LyricsAnd you say this ain't living
You say you can't go on
You only take as you've given
And now your hope is all but gone
Though you lost your way (Now is not forever)
But I know your pain
We all fall sometimes, you're not the first
But I know it hurts, yeah, I know it hurts
In the end you'll find what you deserve
Still I know it hurts, yeah I know it hurts
There are tides slowly rising, the storm is on it's way, yeah
But you can't keep on fighting, so battered, worn and so afraid
Though it's sad and wrong, I hope you will remember
You must carry on
We all fall sometimes you're not the first
But I know it hurts, yeah I know it hurts
In the end you'll find what you deserve
Still I know it hurts, yeah I know it hurts
There's still tomorrow, hold on, hold on
There's still tomorrow, just wait, just wait
There's still tomorrow, hold on, hold on
We all fall sometimes you're not the first
But I know it hurts, yeah I know it hurts
In the end you'll find what you deserve
Still I know it hurts, yeah I know it hurts1Embed
