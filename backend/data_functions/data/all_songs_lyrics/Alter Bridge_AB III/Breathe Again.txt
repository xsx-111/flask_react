Breathe Again LyricsI have played the part
I have all but lost my soul
And I have sacrificed
For what it's worth, I just don't know
In the silence of my heart
There is a distant call
Yeah
It beckons me to stand apart
So I set out on my own
Just to breathe again
Touch the light that calls me home
Just to reach the end
Where I'm free to breathe again
Through the suffering
Through the misery and pain
Never anything
But the will to see the day
When the promise might be born
Light the spark within
Yeah
'Cause I can't take it anymore
So I set out on my own
Just to breathe again
Touch the light that calls me home
Just to reach the end
Where I'm free to breathe again
Well I am free to roam
And set out on my own
To rise above the hands that try to hold me down
Before the end, I know I'll breathe again
To find my way
So I set out on my own
Just to breathe again
Touch the light that calls me home
Just to reach the end
I'm leaving today
I'm leaving today
I'm leaving today2Embed
