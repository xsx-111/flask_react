Words Darker Than Their Wings Lyrics
You say you are right, I hope that I'm wrong
I know that you've tried, but still it is gone
Just don't you lose hope
I swear I'd never dream that we're alone
Now don't you let go
I swear I still believe though I don't know

Remember the years when I still walked tall
I only fear, now I only crawl
How could I be wrong?
I hope there comes a day your fear is gone
How could we be lost?
Lost just ceased to be, not carry on

Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know truth alone
Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know truth alone
Truth alone
You can love someone, oh
Go, never to ask why or to fear again
Go find your peace tonight (Night, night)
Go set out towards the sun, let the new begin
Go, soon your day will come (Come, come)
Oh, day will come, oh

Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know truth alone
Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know

Truth alone
Truth alone
Truth alone
Truth aloneEmbed
