Life Must Go On Lyrics
Sitting alone in the cold of the night
You're trying to find what you need to survive
You're so afraid, you can't go on

Left in the silence that tears at your heart
They only remind you how broken you are
You've lost your way but hope is not gone

'Cause the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end, just pay no mind at all
And keep rolling, rolling
Life must go on, it must go on

Do you remember and long for the past?
Love was eternal and joy seemed to last
Yesterday? Forever is gone

'Cause the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end, just pay no mind at all
And keep rolling, rolling
Life must go on, it must go on
We have our misfortunes, the darkest of days
We must endure and keep strong
Just look to the morning, the promise awaits
And know that this life must go on

And the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end, just pay no mind at all
And keep rolling, rolling
Life must go on, it must go on
And the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end, just pay no mind at all
And keep rolling, rolling
Life must go on, it must go on

Life must go on, life must go on
When you're feeling okay
So you keep rolling on, keep rolling on
We all have our mistakes
Life must go on, life must go on
So you keep rolling on, keep rolling on1Embed
