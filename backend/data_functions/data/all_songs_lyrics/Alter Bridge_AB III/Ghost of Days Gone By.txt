Ghost of Days Gone By Lyrics
The misery I know
Like a friend that won't let go
Is creeping up on me now once again
So I sing this song tonight
To the ghost that will not die
And somehow it seems to haunt me till the end

Do you feel the same
For what was remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the ghost of days gone by

I remember summer days
We were young and unafraid
With innocence we'd glide beneath the stars
It seems so long ago
Beyond the life that I now know
Before the years would have their way and break my heart

Do you feel the same
For what was remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the ghost of days gone by
And I know it's drawing closer
With each day I feel the end
I... don't wanna die
Don't wanna die, don't wanna die
I don't wanna die


Do you feel the same
For what was remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the days gone by
Do they haunt you like a ghost until the end

Haunt you 'til the end
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end2Embed
