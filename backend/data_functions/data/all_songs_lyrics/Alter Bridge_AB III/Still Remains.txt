Still Remains LyricsI cast a line when I saw you were drowning
Still you turn your back on me
Pulled you from the fire when you were burning
Still you never could believe
So carry on if you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains
I save you from your fall when you were slipping
Still you broke from me to run
So how can you justify the life you're living
You must carry on if you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains
You'll deny it all
You'll deny me once again
But I've seen it all
I know you've come to crawl
Back to me before the end
Carry on if you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains
So carry on if you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains
Still remainsEmbed
