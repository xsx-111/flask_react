Isolation Lyrics
When all is lost to you inside
When all the darkness takes the light
The ritual, it has begun
And now you tear away from everyone

Disconnected, so alone, yeah
Sever ties from all you know

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again, oh
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be, yeah

Justify, you waste away
You dare to dream but still you're too afraid
And now you're broken and deceived
Lost to live this cruel reality

You're disconnected, so alone
Sever ties from all you know
Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again, oh
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be, yeah


Maybe you'll stand
Maybe you'll give and break to find another way
And make things better
Maybe you'll find
A life you can live and learn to love along the way
And make things better
(And make things better)

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again, oh
Isolation (isolation)
If you could only see
What will come to be, yeah
Isolation (isolation)
Brings you to the end
Until you love again, oh
Isolation (isolation)
If you could only see
What will come to be

You're disconnected, so alone
What will come to be
You're disconnected, so alone2Embed
