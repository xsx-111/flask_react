Zero Lyrics
Now there is a light in the dark, some will say
There is a grace up high
There is a beauty that some can behold
Not I, not I
There is a power that's felt from the shore
There is a force that won't break
But all of these things, to me, are no more
I've changed, I've changed

What in the hell have you done
Cast aside all that you love
Sorrows you'll never outrun

Zero
Nothing for you's ever good enough
Zero
Nothing makes you whole

How many times have you felt all alone
How many tears have you cried
Called out in vain for a God to behold
Inside, inside
How many fires you let die in your heart
How many storms must you face
Left out to fight for yourself in the cold
No faith, no faith

So nothing to lean on this time
Nothing is left to decide
All that you've known, you deny

Zero
Nothing for you's ever good enough
Zero
Nothing makes you whole
Zero
Nothing for you's ever good enough
Zero
Nothing makes you whole

Go now, surrender
You can't take no more
And just cry out, surrender
Your faith is no more

What in the hell have you done
Cast aside all that you love
Sorrows you'll never outrun
Just look what you have become

Zero
Nothing for you's ever good enough
Zero
Nothing makes you whole
Zero
Nothing for you's ever good enough
Zero
Nothing makes you whole
