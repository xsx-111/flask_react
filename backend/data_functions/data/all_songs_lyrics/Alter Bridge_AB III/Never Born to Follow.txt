Never Born to Follow Lyrics
I know you feel it tonight
She’s a million miles from this life
Never to return
She left it all behind
If only I could have known
The things she held in her soul
She harbored so much hurt
She faced the world alone

She dropped out and just tore herself away
She was never born to follow
Dropped out of a world she couldn’t take
And she was never born to follow

Into this life, she was born
A firefly in the storm
And God, how she would burn
She needed so much more
She never said goodbye
So it came as no surprise
I always feared the worst
The peace she had to find
She dropped out and just tore herself away
She was never born to follow
Dropped out of a world she couldn’t take
And she was never born to follow

What else could be said
What else could be done
Life has slipped away
Should have, could have, overcome
Still, I miss her face
Brighter than the sun
She had to find her way
She dared to dream, she dared to run

She dropped out and just tore herself away
She was never born to follow
Dropped out of a world she couldn’t take
And she was never born to follow
