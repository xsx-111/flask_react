Fallout LyricsAnother rebel runs against the grain
A loner is born
He's filled with anguish
Deep within he's dying everyday
To find his way
He is lost
So consumed
Can you feel it
Somewhere in the fallout
He's someone just like you
Who's lost to find the truth
Can you hear him
From afar he cries out
For the answer to be shown
As he dares to walk the fallout on his own
So frustrated
He walks the light alone
Courage sets him apart
He is so faithless
All he once embraced he now disowns
He let it go
All the while
He still waits
Can you feel it
Somewhere in the fallout
He's someone just like you
Who's lost to find the truth
Can you hear him
From afar he cries out
For the answer to be shown
As he dares to walk the fallout on his own
Left behind
He's walking
A-burning still he tries
To unearth the meaning
To this life
Cast aside, he's weary
A bleeding to behold
Disconnected, still he fights
Truth alone
Can you feel it
Somewhere in the fallout
He's someone just like you
Who's lost to find the truth
Can you hear him
From afar he cries out
For the answer to be shown
As he dares to walk
The fallout on his own
