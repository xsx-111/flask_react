Hope
The only thing that we have left to hold
In a world gone mad, there's nowhere left to go
Where nothing lasts, there's permanence, I know

Is there something I can say
To bring back what once remained
Where is all that we let go
Where is home

Doubt
From inside, I hear it calling out
Tearing at the truth, it must be found
In the end, it only brings me down

Is there something I can say
To bring back what once remained
Where is all that we let go
Where is home

If you need a reason, a reason tonight
To cast every doubt from your heart, from your mind
Look to tomorrow and maybe you'll find
Something more, something more
Is there something I can say
To bring back what once remained
Where is all that we let go
Where is home
