Make It Right LyricsHow many times have you cut only to feel the pain
How many days have you run only to crawl
How many nights did you scream, only to scream in vain
How many years till you face the shame of it all
Into the fire you fall
If only you can make it right
Stand up and fight for resolve
If only you can make it right
How many lies did you steal just to convince the fool
How many masks did you wear disguise and remove
How many years till you break all that keeps breaking you
How many tears will you waste while finding the truth
Into the fire you fall
If only you can make it right
Stand up and fight for resolve
If only you can make it right
Into the fire you fall
If only you can make it right
Stand up and fight for resolve
If only you can make it right
There comes a time
When one must decide
The life they are living is far from true
Lost and deceived
Nothing to believe
I know I have so much yet to prove
Prove
I've yet to prove
Prove
Into the fire you fall
If only you can make it right
Stand up and fight for resolve
If only you can make it right
Into the fire you fall
If only you can make it right
Stand up and fight for resolve
If only you can make it rightEmbed
