Show Me a Sign LyricsA trail of tears beyond redemption
Just a word and nothing more
No more
I must reveal I am falling
Into the dark
I now am born
So if you hear this cry
Show me a sign
Give me meaning
Lead me to life
Let me know
Why all the lies I'm believing
Have led me so far
Far from home
A cutting anguish not forgotten
Eternal life will not be mine, tonight
But if I wake to find perdition
At least I know
The fault is mine
Yes, I know
The fault is mine
So if you hear this cry
Show me a sign
Give me meaning
Lead me to life
Let me know
Why all the lies I'm believing
Have led me so far
Far from home
And the fire inside is gone
And all that I once had is lost
Into the darkness I am born
A trail of tears beyond redemption
Just a word and nothing more
I must reveal that I'm falling
Into the dark I am born
Show me a sign
Give me meaning
Lead me to life
Let me know
Why all the lies I'm believing
Have led me so far
Far from home
Oh
