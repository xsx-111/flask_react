Laments LyricsIt's a green-striped sheet lifted from me
I am free of two very heavy bodies
Once, we three had slept soundly
I couldn't keep them around
Fold the blankets down, and
Found new sleeping ground
Bed-springs squeaking, tires squealing away
From one another; We all used to be lovers here
Bodies laying say they'll stay, just like boxes
Stacked the same way, labeled and separated, hey
Go ahead, take the couch
I know I don't wanna sit here next to nobody
Go ahead, take the fridge
I know I don't want you going hungry, yeah
Go ahead, take the cat
I know you're only gonna be coming back, so
Go ahead, take it all
I know you've been wanting to
Settle down
Has it always been
Settling down?
One on the left says to the one on the right
"I could make a very good wife for you"
One on the right says to the one on the left
"Let's take this one step at a time"
One on the right says to the one on the left
"You know I need you all the time"
One on the right says to the one on the left
"I think I changed my mind"
My insides sing-
A song for the sad ones
Who say they'll marry, they guess
(If she’s wearing a white dress
If he behaves his very best)
A song for the sad ones
Who say they'll marry, they guess
(If she’s wearing a white dress
If he behaves his very best)
A song for the sad ones
Who say they'll marry, they guess
(If she’s wearing a white dress
If he behaves his very best)
A song for the sad ones
Who say they'll marry, they guess
(If she’s wearing a white dress
If he behaves his very, very best)
Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes
Go ahead, take the couch
I know I don't wanna sit here next to nobody
Go ahead, take the fridge
I know I don't want you going hungry, yeah
Go ahead, take the cat
I know you're only gonna be coming back so
Go ahead, take it all
I know you've been wanting to
Settle down
Has it always been
Settling down?
My elastic, steel, and spring
They will tell you everything
If you lay down, for a minute
My elastic, steel, and spring
They will tell you everything
If you lay down, for a minute
The mattress maker’s makin' his living
By the minute, by the minute
The mattress maker’s makin' his living
By the minute, by the minute
The mattress maker’s makin' his living, baby
By, by the minute
The mattress maker’s makin' his living, baby
By the
The mattress makers makin' his living, baby
By, by
The mattress maker’s makin' his living, baby
