Sally II LyricsTwo days gone, somebody
Checked in on you - that unsettling smell
Had gotten into
All the tenant's rooms
You were found sitting up
All alone in the bathtub, your clothes dry
But your brother doesn't want to know
And nobody told your caseworker you died
Weightlifting magazines, your little TV sets
Your cigarettes, cigarettes, cigarettes
Some ad sent you a big fake
Million dollar bill
You thought it was the real thing
You were gonna buy the world
How crushing it must have been to find
This is not your place, this is
Not your time
At least you're numb to the sun
Crashing down upon
Your fifty-something hide
Time's already working hard against the mind
There is no kindness, there's a different
Kind of crime
Voices you were hearing baby-blue
Was it God
Why did he only want to talk to you
Your forgotten mind
Is also mineEmbed
