Get Disowned Lyrics
What brought me in here
In the morning, my heart looked bent
Please, don't tell my parents
My friend says you don't wanna know
Who you are, when it comes down to it
I got an uncle, knocked out a bear with a frying pan
His wife is his best friend, nobody else ever sees him
Except in September, for one weekend
That's how it's done, done
Yeah done, done

The Pocono mountains in the sixties
Fathers in station wagons cut the corners hard
Past broken firs, burned stark
And the only shapes moving were
The ghostly forms of cattle
Walking in the dark, moving...

One whole family used to sleep upon this floor
From the kitchen to the door
Elvis never gave, Elvis never gave an encore
Greater than my love gone out the door
Is the love that I've ignored
Elvis, Elvis never gave an encore
Meteor, meteor, make me young
Make me young
Meteor, meteor, make me young
Make me-
Meteor, meteor, make me young!2Embed
