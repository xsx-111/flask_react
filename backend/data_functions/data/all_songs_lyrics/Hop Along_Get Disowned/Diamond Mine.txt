Diamond Mine Lyrics
Waxen nun in her bed
"I had to do it!" She said
"If you let a child be a child
You ain't doing her no favors in the end"
Which brings us to her portrait
The photograph of the orphan they ripped in half
And left what was left in the forest- a half
Of which there is no name

Most love comes around second hand
It's a starving age, better take, take what you can
And maybe you've been orphaned unforgivably
If so, I bet you know of some traditional wretch you left
To catch her death out in the snow

So unhappy child, flash me your Rottweiler smile
Don't let no modern kind of love bring you down
There's plenty of decent tail in this town
Did you grow up in a trailer park? Did you grow up
In an immaculate and humorless place?
Where the holy spirit, when you came crawling in
Turned away his face
There are some parents
Whose children long for divorce
There are some parents
Whose children long for divorce
There are some parents
Whose children long...
Now that you've buried your head in this time
Where dust, sharp and fine
Rises from the mouth of the diamond mine
Where hungry pickaxes tear at the rind
And cut men up from the inside

Oh, gun-toting urchin
What do you need?
Oh, it's nothing
She ain't coming back to me
Oh, gnawing orphan
What can I bring?
Oh, it's nothing
He already took everything1Embed
