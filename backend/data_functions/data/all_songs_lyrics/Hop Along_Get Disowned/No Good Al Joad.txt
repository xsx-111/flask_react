No Good Al Joad LyricsPut that chicken in your yard
Out of it's misery
Its feathers torn apart
No rooster can be more
Ruthless than you, more
Stupid than me
I found your angel in the crow's nest
It's a god-awful mess up here!
She's clawed through the floor
Nobody seems to stick around
How much more can you take?
Old men fire from their windows
Warning shots over your head
And your dearest friends
Are all coming around
With their tails between their legs
But your engine is still running, although
The gears are covered with grime
Everybody is a little hard to love, sometimes
You are my favorite
Because you're a long shot
You are my enemy
Because you forgot
Generous people, they fill me with doubt
But that's something I'd rather not talk about
And no heavy charge can make me stay
I'm a no-good Al Joad, anyway
I'll never lie in the back of no truck...
So if you want a whole lot
But without getting caught
Babe, you better go get in line!
Everybody is a little hard
To love sometimes
The first person I realized was dying
Thanked everyone for the cake, soft and low
Now I can tell, the ground barely feels
My footsteps, as I must go3Embed
