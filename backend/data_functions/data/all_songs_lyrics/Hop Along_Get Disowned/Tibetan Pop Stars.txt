Tibetan Pop Stars Lyrics
How content are the ones with simple demands
They meet their fianc√©s cherry picking out in Canada
While cursing the river, a seven fingered man
His three sleepless wives all equally sick of him

Honey, I left to see some action
What's with all these swamps?
All I'm passing are hospitals and space-camps
Nobody is asking me, "What about your other?"
If they did, I'd tell them you're a

Stranger in India
I'm gonna be creeping on you so hard
You're seducing Tibetan pop stars, and
Wrecking motor-cars

I know it's true
This is wrong, love
Why is everything so expensive?
Maybe in two years, you can forgive me
I'll be living kinder
I'll have found my place as a
Stranger in India
I'm gonna be creeping on you so hard
You're seducing Tibetan pop stars, and
Wrecking motor-cars
A stranger in India
Doing okay so far
I'm just waiting on the feathers and tar
You are the only one
You are

Nobody deserves you the way that I do
Nobody deserves you the way that I do
Nobody deserves you the way that I do
Nobody deserves you the way that I do

Come home, my stranger in India
Because waiting on you is too hard
The reason I haven't written back is because
I'm doing all that bad shit I was
My love is average
I obey an average law
My love is average
I obey an average law7Embed
