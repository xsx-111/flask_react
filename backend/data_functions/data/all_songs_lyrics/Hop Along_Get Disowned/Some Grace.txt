Some Grace Lyrics
It's time
To exit with some grace
Now that you've
Given only what
You know how to

And remember in anger
How happy you are when they come
We came to say we got somewhere
And then we got gone
(We got gone...)

It's time to exit with some grace
Now that you've given only what
You know how to
Now that you and me have
Given what we know how toEmbed
