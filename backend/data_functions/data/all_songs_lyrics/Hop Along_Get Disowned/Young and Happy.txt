Young and Happy Lyrics
Wild things talk, filthy reservoir
Today you are twenty-one, twenty-one
This car's uninsured, I think it still knows how
To run down to Savannah, Georgia
No sisters who came before ya
Were so true, and all the world going dark
And changing around you

Someone we love hitched a ride to
Minneapolis, it aged him too soon
Someone I never told you I turned my back on
Now I think she hates me, hates me, oh
To be a child again, and easily forgiven!
But I've done my fair share to
Weaken the envied innocent

At least with you, I got to be young and happy
With you, I got to be young and happy
Now to think of all the strangers I followed
My hands empty, with you...

Then the day came
When I had to tell you a lie
It was to protect you
And that's another lie
In Savannah, Georgia, tired specters
Stretch their arms- couldn't you stay
If you looked the other way?
At least with you, I got to be young and happy
With you, I got to be young and happy
Now to think of all the strangers I followed
My hands empty, with you...

With you, I got to be young and happy...Embed
