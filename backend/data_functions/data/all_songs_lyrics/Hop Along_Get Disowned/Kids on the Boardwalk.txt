Kids on the Boardwalk LyricsJos√© pushed me on the swing
Explained what it was that a B.J. meant
His stories were dark and deep, like his eyes
Your eyes so full of secrets; I guess I loved you
Right when my mom said your mom's a lesbian
It's been so long, I probably wouldn't know you
If I saw you again
I followed Eric, second through fifth grade
His raspy voice, down the long hallway
He liked the dirty drawings I made
Girls with impossible breasts
I tried to sell him one for fifty cents
Now they're in the back of Mrs. Waltz's desk
And I hope I never see that boy again
Young love is in the air
Young love is cheap; I mean, it's everywhere
This ain't no statement of knowledge
It's just my defense
I've been ignoring the cost
Is this love, is this love that I've lost?
Worst of all, ain't nothing big
Ain't nothing big about this at all
And honey, I don't want to be ok with never
Seeing you again
You kids on the boardwalk
Come back in, to the dry, choked-up land
I want truth and beauty
I want to love someone simply
I want truth and beauty
I want to love something
Without it having to need meEmbed
