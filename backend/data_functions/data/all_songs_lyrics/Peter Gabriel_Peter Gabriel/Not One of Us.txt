Not One of Us Lyrics
It's only water in a stranger's tear
Looks are deceptive, but distinctions are clear
A foreign body and a foreign mind
Never welcome in the land of the blind

You may look like we do
Talk like we do
But you know how it is

You're not one of us, not one of us
No, you're not one of us
Not one of us, not one of us
No, you're not one of us

There's safety in numbers when you learn to divide
How can we be in if there is no outside?
All shades of opinion feed an open mind
But your values are twisted, let us help you unwind

You may look like we do
Talk like we do
But you know how it is
It's only water
It's only water
It's only water
It's only water in a stranger's tear

You may look like we do
Talk like we do
But you know how it is

You're not one of us, not one of us
No, you're not one of us
You're not one of us, not one of us
No, you're not one of us


He's not one of us
He's not one of us
He's not one of us
He's not one of us
He's not one of us
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
He's not one of us
He's not one of us
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
He's not one of us
He's not one of us
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
He's not one of us
He's not one of us
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
He's not one of us
He's not one of us
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
He's not one of usEmbed
