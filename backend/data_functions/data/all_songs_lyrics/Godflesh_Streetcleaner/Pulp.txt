Pulp LyricsWhen on my own
I feel free
I can refuse
Arms wait, enfold
Nothing left for me
Waiting
Feel free
I can refuse
Arms wait, enfold
Nothing left for me
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Pulp
Pulp
Pulp
Feel free
Feel free
Feel free
I can refuse
I can refuse
Refuse
Refuse
Pulp
Pulp
Pulp
Refuse
Refuse
Fuse
Fuse
