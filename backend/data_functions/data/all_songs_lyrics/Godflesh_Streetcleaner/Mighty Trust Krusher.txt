Mighty Trust Krusher LyricsI need this
I need you
On your knees
And we'll pray together now
Effortless
Effortless
Effortless
Mighty Trust Krusher
I need this
It's in my heart
I love you
My trust is evermore
Effortless
Effortless
Effortless
Mighty Trust Krusher
Hate me
Tread on me
And you taught me
I finally slay you
Now
Effortless
Effortless
Effortless
Effortless
Effortless
Effortless
Effortless
