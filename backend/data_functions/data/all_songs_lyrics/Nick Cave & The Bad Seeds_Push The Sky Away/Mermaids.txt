Mermaids Lyrics
She was a catch
We were a match
I was the match that would fire up her snatch
There was a catch
I was no match
I was fired from her crotch
I sit around and watch
The mermaids sun themselves out on the rocks
They are beyond our touch
I watch and watch
Wave at me
They wave at me
They wave and slip
Back into the sea

And all the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the water
And all the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the sea

I believe in God
I believe in mermaids too
I believe in 72 virgins on a chain (why not, why not)
I believe in the Rapture
For I've seen your face
On the floor of the ocean
At the bottom of the rain
I do driver alertness course
I do husband alertness course
I do mermaid alertness course
Watch them out on the rocks
Wave at me
They wave at me
They wave and slip
Back into the sea
   
And all the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the water
And all the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the sea
And all the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the water
And all the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the seaEmbed
