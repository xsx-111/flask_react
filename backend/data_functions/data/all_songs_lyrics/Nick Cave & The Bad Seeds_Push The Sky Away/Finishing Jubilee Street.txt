Finishing Jubilee Street Lyrics
I'd just finished writing Jubilee Street
I laid down on my bed and fell into a deep sleep
And when I awoke, I believed I'd taken a bride called Mary Stanford
And I flew into a frenzy searching high and low
Because in my dream the girl was very young
I said, "Hey little girl, where do you hide?
You draw lightning from the sky"

All of this in her dark hair
All of this in her dark hair, oh Lord

See that girl, comin' on down
Comin' on down, comin' on down
See that girl, comin' on down
Comin' on down, comin' on down

Last night your shadow scampered up the wall, it flied
It leaped like a black spider between your legs, and cried
"My children, my children
They are lost to us"

All of this in her dark hair, oh Lord
All of this in her dark hair, oh Lord
See that girl, comin' on down
Comin' on down, comin' on down
See that girl, comin' on down
Comin' on down, comin' on down
See that girl, comin' on down
Comin' on down, comin' on down
See that girl, comin' on down
Comin' on down, comin' on down2Embed
