Wide Lovely Eyes Lyrics
You wave at the sky with wide lovely eyes
Waves and waves of love goodbye
Through the garden with your secret key
Down the tunnel that leads to the sea
Step on the beach beneath the iron skies
You wave and wave with your wide lovely eyes
Crystal waves and waves of love
You wave and say goodbye

Your dress sighs with your wide lovely strides
All along the street and lately the stories abound
They've dismantled the funfair
And they've shut down the rides
They've hung the mermaids from the streetlights
By their hair
And with wide lovely eyes you wave at the sky
And near the high window watching you ride
The waves of blue and the waves of love
You wave and say goodbye

The night expands, I am expanding
I watch your hands like butterflies landing
All among the myths and the legends we create
And all the laughing stories we tell our friends
Close the windows, clear up the mess
It's getting late
It's darker and closer to the end
Through the tunnel and down the sea
And on the pebbled beach your laces you untie
And arrange your shoes side by side
You wave and wave with wide lovely eyes
Distant waves and waves of distant love
You wave and say goodbyeEmbed
