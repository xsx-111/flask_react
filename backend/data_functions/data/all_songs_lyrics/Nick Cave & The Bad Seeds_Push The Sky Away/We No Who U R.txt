We No Who U R Lyrics
Tree don't care what the little bird sings
We go down with the dew in the morning light
The tree don't know what the little bird brings
We go down with the dew in the morning

And we breathe it in
There is no need to forgive
Breathe it in
There is no need to forgive
Again

The trees will stand like pleading hands
We go down with the dew in the morning light
The trees all stand like pleading hands
We go down with the dew in the morning

And we breathe it in
There is no need to forgive
Breathe it in
There is no need to forgive
Again
The trees will burn with blackened hands
We return with the light of the evening
The trees will burn blackened hands
Nowhere to rest, with nowhere to land

And we know who you are, and we know where you live
And we know there's no need to forgive
And we know who you are, and we know where you live
And we know there's no need to forgive
And we know who you are, and we know where you live
And we know there's no need to forgive
And we know who you are, and we know where you live
And we know there's no need to forgive
