Deform to Form a Star Lyrics
Oh once in a while
I learn how to smile
Horses shadows and rain on stone
No god here I'm sure
This must be the cure
For all this carrion and aimless drift

Retreat from the begging
And invites to the wedding
Revelation means nothing here
In time we forget our
Need to devour
All the stories of tortured souls

Crawl into your arms
Become the night forever
Coiled and close, the moment froze
Deform to form a star
Here on earth together
I got time to share and a well used stare

This smile isn't pure
Certain or sure
Cold precision was never there
The way we uncoil
Return to the soil
Flaws are everything and chaos reigns

Crawl into your arms
Become the night forever
Coiled and close, the moment froze
Deform to form a star
Here on earth together
I got time to share and a well used stareEmbed
