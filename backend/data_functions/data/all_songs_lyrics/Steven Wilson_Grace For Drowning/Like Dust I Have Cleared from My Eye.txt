Like Dust I Have Cleared from My Eye LyricsWell that's something that you're laughing at me
And I hope you know what it is that you're laughing about
'Cause it won't be long now 'til they're reeling you in
The same situation, the same disappointment you bring
So I hope you're happy with the impression you made
Deep in denial, like you planned it this way
But you're lost to me, like dust I have cleared from my eye
Your words have no meaning, so I stare up into the sky
Breathe in now, breathe out loud
Breathe in now, breathe out loudEmbed
