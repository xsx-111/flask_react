Index LyricsI’m a collector, I collect anything I find
I never throw anything away that’s mine
And I’d collect you too if I was given half a chance
And trap you under the glass and add my autograph
I catalogue, I preserve, and I index
And file you into my collectible Rolodex
I keep the rubbish what other people give away
And keep all of the pieces in a metal tray

Hoard

Index
I’m a collector and I’ve always been misunderstood
I like the things that people always seem to overlook
I gather up and catalogue it in a book I wrote
There’s so much now that I forget if I don’t make a note
If I collected you and put you in a little cage
I could take you out and study you every day
It isn’t easy being me, it’s kind of lonely work
My obligation to collecting is my only thirst
