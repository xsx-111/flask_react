(And She Said) Take Me Now Lyrics
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
What you waitin' for?
I know you're watchin' me
Hey boy, come on and take me now
What you waitin' for?
I know you're watchin' me
Hey boy, come on and take me now

Can I talk to you for a minute?
You've been looking all night for your shining star
Well, baby, here I am, so why you waitin'?
Step on over, let me show you how bad you are

Just let me take the lead
All you gotta do is let your mind be free
Let's hit the floor and cause a scene
Get real wet if you know what I mean
What you say, baby?

(And she said) Take me now
I'm hungry for your lovin'
(And she said) Show me how
You got me working, honey
(And she said) Right now
I'm hot just like an oven (And she said)
So take me now
Boy, you make me feel like I gotta dance
(I gotta dance, gotta dance baby, I gotta dance...)
I feel good to you, you try to hide it
And I can tell by the way you push up close to me
Your body temperature is arisin'
Something's goin' down as far as I can see

Just let me take the lead
All you gotta do is let your mind be free
Let's hit the floor and cause a scene
Get real wet if you know what I mean
What you say, baby?

(And she said) Take me now
I'm hungry for your lovin'
(And she said) Show me how
You got me working, honey
(And she said) Right now
I'm hot just like an oven (And she said)
So take me now
Boy, you make me feel like I gotta dance

You know
Don't I
Say, "don't I make you feel like you gotta dance?"
Once I get to know ya (No)
I'm gonna show ya (No)
That there's no better way (Yeah)
Let's dance the night away (Yeah)
I wanna control ya (No)
Just wanna hold ya (No)
Dance the night away
So what you say, baby, what you say?
(What you sayin' to me?)

(And she said) Take me now
(Oh)
I'm hungry for your lovin'
(Hungry for you)
(And she said)
Show me how
(Oh)
You got me workin', honey
(Got me working)
(And she said)
Right now
(Oh)
I'm hot just like an oven
(Hot just like an oven)
(And she said)
So take me now
Boy, you make me feel like I gotta dance
(And she said)
Take me now
(Oh)
I'm hungry for your lovin'
(Hungry for you)
(And she said)
Show me how
(Oh)
You got me workin', honey
(Got me workin')
(And she said)
Right now
(Oh)
I'm hot just like an oven
(And she said)
So take me now
Boy you make me feel like I gotta dance
Like you gotta dance, like you gotta dance, like you gotta dance, no...
Like you gotta dance, like you gotta dance, like you gotta dance, no...
Here we go now
Oh, oh
