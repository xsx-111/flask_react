Cry Me a River Lyrics
You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance, and made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned, now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river, cry me a river
Cry me a river, cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)

You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (Messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned, now it's your turn, to cry
(Go on and just) Cry me a river
(Go on and just) Cry me a river
(Baby, go on and just) Cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)

Oh! (Oh! Well!) The damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving (Oh, oh, oh!)
Oh! (Oh! Well!) The damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving (Oh, oh, oh!)
Oh! (Oh! Well!) The damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving (Oh, oh, oh!)
Oh! (Oh! Well!) The damage is done
So I guess I'll be l-l-l-l-l-leaving (Oh, oh, oh!)
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

Cry me a river (Go on and just), cry me a river
(Baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (You can go on and just), cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)
Cry me a river (Baby, go on and just), cry me a river
(Go on and just)
Cry me a river (Come on baby, cry), cry me a river (don't wanna cry no more, yeah, yeah)
Cry me a river, cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river, oh, cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me), oh, cry me a river
(Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me), oh, cry me a river
(Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me), oh, cry me a river
(Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me)54Embed
