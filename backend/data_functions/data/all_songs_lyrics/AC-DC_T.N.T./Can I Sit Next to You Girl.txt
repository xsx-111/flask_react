Can I Sit Next to You Girl Lyrics
Well, I met this girl for the first time Saturday night
Standing in the queue at the Odeon, alright

Oh, I took her by surprise
When I gave her one of my lines
She started smiling at me real fine, ha
And that's when I say

"Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you?"

Intermission, we were doing alright
'Till this guy came up and stood by her side

Oh, I took him by surprise
When I gave him one of my lines
She started smiling at me real fine
And that's when I said

"Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you, can I sit next to you girl?"

Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you? (Let me take you home)
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you? (Lick your ear)
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
C'mon, can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
