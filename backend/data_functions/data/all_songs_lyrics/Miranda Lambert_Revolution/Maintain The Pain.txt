Maintain The Pain Lyrics
I put a bullet in my radio
Somethin' just hit me funny, I don't know
Just pulled the trigger goin' down the road
You slam the door and knock me off the wire
Been walkin' lines and you've been burning tires
Slow and easy, ain't that what you like?

It’s insane
It’s in vain
You stay to maintain the pain

I hear your name and then it burns a hole
I swear I hate you, but I can't let go
The kind of feelings that you can’t console

It’s all in vain
It’s all insane
I swear you'll stay, swear you'll stay to maintain the pain
It’s all in vain (I hear your name and then it burns a hole)
It’s all insane (I swear I hate you, but I can't let go)
I swear you'll stay, swear you'll stay to maintain the pain
(The kind of feelings that you can’t console)
