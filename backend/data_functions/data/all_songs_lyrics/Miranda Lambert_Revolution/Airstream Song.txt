Airstream Song Lyrics
Sometimes I wish I lived in air stream homemade curtains
Lived just like a gypsy
Break a heart, roll out of town
'Cause gypsies never get tied down

Sometimes I wish I lived on a mountain
Drank from a stream instead of a fountain
I'd stay there, top of the world
But I was born a red dirt girl

Unbridled, or tethered and tied
The safety of the fence
Or the danger of the ride
I'll always be unsatisfied

Sometimes I wish I lived by a pier
In a lighthouse with a chandelier
I'd watch everybody's ships come in
And then I'd sail away with them

Unanchored in a storm
Or safety on the shore
If this is all I need
Why do I want more?
Sometimes I wish I lived in air stream homemade curtains
Lived just like a gypsy3Embed
