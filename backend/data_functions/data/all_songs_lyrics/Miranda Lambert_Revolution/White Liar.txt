White Liar Lyrics
Hey, white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why, white liar

You better be careful what you do
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes
If they ever found you out
You better be careful what you say
It never really added up any way
I got friends in this town

Hey, white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why, white liar

You said you went out to a bar
And walked some lady to her car
But your face has more to tell
'Cause my cousin saw you on the street
With a red head named Bernice
Turns out you don't lie too well
Hey, white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why, white liar

Here's a bombshell just for you
Turns out I've been lyin' too

Now I'm a white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of my tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
