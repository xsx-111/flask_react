Virginia Bluebell Lyrics
Carrying the weight on the end of a limb
Your just waitin' for somebody
To pick you up again
Shaded by a tree, can't live up to a rose
All you ever wanted was a sunny place to grow

Pretty little thing
Sometimes you got to look up
And let the world see all the beauty that you're made of
'Cause the way you hang your head, nobody can tell
You're my Virginia bluebell
My Virginia bluebell

Even through a stone
A flower can bloom
You just need a little push
Spring is coming soon
Umbrella in the rain
They'll roll off your back
Better what you can, realize what you have

Pretty little thing
Sometimes you got to look up
And let the world see all the beauty that you're made of
'Cause the way you hang your head, nobody can tell
You're my Virginia bluebell
Put a little light in the darkest places
Put a little smile on the saddest faces

Pretty little thing
Sometimes you got to look up
And let the world see all the beauty that you're made of
'Cause the way you hang your head, nobody can tell
You're my Virginia bluebell
