Sin for a Sin Lyrics
I remember vividly what that vision did to me
You layin' with her in our bed
Love can be a tragedy when you do what you did to me
All I'm seein' now is red

I need to repent
A sin for a sin

Bible told me to forget
All those who trespass against
Tread their feet on sacred ground
Bad things come with consequence
What feels good, hurts in the end
Donâ€™t wanna think about that now

I need to repent
A sin for a sin

Fire and brimstone, dirt and a headstone
Bury them, baby, all of our sins
Hear the thunder, six feet under
Hit your knees won't do it again
Guilty pleasure
Ease the pain
Whisky running through my veins
Too late to save you now

I need to repent
A sin for a sin

Fire and brimstone, dirt and a headstone
Bury them, baby, all of our sins
Hear the thunder, six feet under
Hit your knees won't do it again

I remember vividly
What that vision did to me2Embed
