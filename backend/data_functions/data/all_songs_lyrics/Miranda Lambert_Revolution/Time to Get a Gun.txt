Time to Get a Gun Lyrics
My neighbor’s car got stolen last night
Right out of his driveway
We heard the dogs barking
We never paid them any mind
And Mary says she’s gonna lock the door
From now on when we go away
I've been walkin' around this farm
Wonderin' if it’s time

Time to get a gun
That’s what I've been thinkin'
I could afford one
If I did just a little less drinkin'
Time to put somethin'
Between me and the sun
When the talkin' is over
It’s time to get a gun

Last week a government man was there
When I walked out my back door
He said, "I’m sorry to bother you, ma’am"
It don’t matter anymore
'Cause even while we were talking
Right here where we stand
They’re making plans for a four lane highway
And a big old over pass
It's time to get a gun
That’s what I've been thinkin'
I could afford one
If I did just a little less drinkin'
Time to put somethin'
Between me and the sun
When the talkin' is over
It’s time to get a gun

Mary says she’s worried about herself and her kids
She’s never known anybody who had a gun
And her daddy never did
But I think it should be up to me
'Cause when it’s all said and done
Somebody’s got to walk into the night
And I’m gonna be that one

It's time to get a gun
That’s what I've been thinkin'
I could afford one
If I did just a little less drinkin'
Time to put somethin'
Between me and the sun
When the talkin' is over
It’s time to get a gun
When the party is over
It’s time to get a gunEmbed
