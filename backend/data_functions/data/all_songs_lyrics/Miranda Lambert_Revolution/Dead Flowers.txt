Dead Flowers Lyrics
I feel like the flowers in this vase
He just brought 'em home one day
"Ain't they beautiful", he said
They've been here in the kitchen and the water's turning grey
They're sittin' in the vase, but now they're dead
Dead flowers

I feel like this long string of lights
They lit up our whole house on Christmas day
But now it's January, and the bulbs have all burned out
But still, they hang
Like dead flowers

He ain't feelin' anything
My love, my hurt, or the sting of this pain
I'm livin' in a hurricane
All he can say is, "Man, ain't it such a nice day?"
Yeah, yeah

I feel like the tires on this car
They said we wonâ€™t go far, but we're still rollin'
I look in the rear view and I see dead flowers in the yard
And that string of lights
And it ain't glowin'
Like dead flowers
Like dead flowers
He ain't feelin' anything
My love, my hurt, or the sting of this pain
And I'm drivin' through a hurricane
All he can say is, "Man, ain't it such a nice day?"
Hey, hey
I guess we'll just go waste
Like dead flowers

Like dead flowers
Dead flowersEmbed
