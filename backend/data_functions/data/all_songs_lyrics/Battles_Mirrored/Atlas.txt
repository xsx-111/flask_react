Atlas Lyrics
People won't be people when they hear this sound
That's been glowing in the dark at the edge of town
People won't be people, no, the people won’t be people when they hear this sound
Won't you show me what begins at the edge of town?

People won't be people when they hear this sound
That's been glowing in the dark at the edge of town
People won't be people, no, the people won’t be people when they hear this sound
Won't you show me what begins at the edge of town?

Singer is a crook, whoa, ey, oh
Singer is a crook, whoa, ey, oh
Singer is a crook, whoa, ey, oh
Singer is a crook, whoa, ey, oh
Kitchen is the cook, whoa, ey, oh
Scissors are the barbers, whoa, ey, oh
Singer is a crook, whoa, ey, oh
The chorus full of actors

People won't be people when they hear this sound
That's been glowing in the dark at the edge of town
People won't be people, no, the people won’t be people when they hear this sound
Won't you show me what begins at the edge of town?
People won't be people when they hear this sound
That's been glowing in the dark at the edge of town
People won't be people, no, the people won’t be people when they hear this sound
Won't you show me what begins at the edge of town?


Singer is a crook, whoa, ey, oh
Singer is a crook, whoa, ey, oh
Singer is a crook, whoa, ey, oh
Singer is a crook, whoa, ey, oh
Kitchen is the cook, whoa, ey, oh
Scissors are the barbers, whoa, ey, oh
Singer is a crook, whoa, ey, oh
The chorus full of actors

People won't be people when they hear this sound
That's been glowing in the dark at the edge of town
People won't be people, no, the people won’t be people when they hear this sound
Won't you show me what begins at the edge of town?

People won't be people when they hear this sound
That's been glowing in the dark at the edge of town
People won't be people, no, the people won’t be people when they hear this sound
Won't you show me what begins at the edge of town4Embed
