Ddiamondd Lyrics
The diamond that was stolen
Held the code that melted
Water into letters
Spelling where it had been taken to
In fact, I had a vision of the numbers
Corresponding with the letters -
T-H-E-D-I-A-M-O-N-D

They're suspended like a prism splitting floodlight
To poles of primary colors clawing the veil of the vacuum
There's a picture of this given to authorities
The sentence "I'm an architect and here's my prison" written on it

With schematics so meticulous, the measurements
Of super-impositions of a room within the window
Make a dream that ends up being such an entity
In your reflection
You are the dream to it, you are the prism

The mirrors in the corner throwing images
Against the other mirrors made counting corners impossible
The breaking news had counted
One, two, three, four, five
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven corners of the mirrored corners!
Why have you done? What you have done something
Is so sinister when staring at the diamond something
You have done sinister why have you done this
Am I in the mirror?
Am I what you have been staring at?
Am I a diamond?

Just like a reflection of a friend of mine
I am a reflection of an enemy
Am I a reflection of an enemy?
Just like a reflection of a friend of mine?2Embed
