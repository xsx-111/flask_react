Silence Lyrics
All those places
Where I recall
The memories that grip me
And pin me down

I go to these places
Pretending to think
I can think of nothing
But anticipate

Somehow expect you'll
Find me there
That by some miracle
You'd be aware

I'd risen this morning
Determined to break
The spell of my longing
And not to think

I freed myself from my family
I freed myself from work
I freed myself, I freed myself
And remained alone
And in my thinking
Steal you away
Though you never wanted me
Anyway

Silence, silence
Silence, silence
Silence, silence
Silence, silence1Embed
