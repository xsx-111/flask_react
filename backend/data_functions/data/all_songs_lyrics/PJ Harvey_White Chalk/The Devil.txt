The Devil LyricsAs soon as I am left alone
The devil wanders into my soul
And I pretend to myself –
I pretend to myself
I go out to the old mile-stone
Insanely expecting you to come there
Knowing that I wait for you there –
That I wait for you there
Come, come, come here at once!
Come, come on a night with no moon
Because all of my being is now pining –
All of my being is now pining
What formerly cheered me
Now seems
Insignificant
