Grow Grow Grow Lyrics
I sowed a seed
Underneath the oak tree
I trod it in
With my boots I trampled it down

Grow, grow, grow, grow

I sowed a rose
Underneath the oak grove
With my boots on the ground
Into the earth I trampled it down

Grow, grow

Teach me how to...
Teach me how to...

Teach me, mummy
How to grow
How to catch someone's fancy
Underneath the twisted oak groveEmbed
