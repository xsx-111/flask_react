Before Departure Lyrics
Farewell my friends
Farewell my dear ones
If I was rude
Forgive my weakness

Goodbye my friends
Goodbye to evening parties
Remember me
In the spring

To work for your bread
Soon you must leave
Remember your families
And work for your children

I don't need much
And the older I become
I realise
My friendships

Will carry me over
Any course of distance
Any cause of sorrow
The friends that last
Will dance one more time
With me
I don't need much
But this I need1Embed
