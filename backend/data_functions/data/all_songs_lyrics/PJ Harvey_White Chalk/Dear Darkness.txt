Dear Darkness LyricsDear darkness, dear darkness
Won't you cover, cover me again?
Dear darkness, dear...
I've been your friend for many years
Won't you do this for me?
Dearest darkness
And cover me from the sound
Of the words tightening
The words are tightening
Around my throat, andâ€¦
And around the throat of the one I love
The tightening, tightening, tightening
Around the throat of the one I love
The tightening, tightening, tightening
Dear darkness, dear darkness
Now it's your time to look after us
'Cause we kept you clothed
We kept you in business
When everyone else was having good luck
So now it's your time
Time to pay
To pay me and the one I love
With the worldly goods you've stashed away
With all the things you took from us1Embed
