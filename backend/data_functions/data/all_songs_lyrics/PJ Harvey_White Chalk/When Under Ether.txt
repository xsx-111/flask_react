When Under Ether Lyrics
The ceiling is moving
Moving in time
Like a conveyor belt
Above my eyes
When under ether
The mind comes alive
But conscious of nothing
But the will to survive
I lay on the bed
Waist down undressed
Look up at the ceiling
Feeling happiness

Human kindness

The woman beside me
Is holding my hand
I point at the ceiling
She smiles, so kind
Something's inside me
Unborn and unblessed
Disappears in the ether
This world to the next
Disappears in the ether
One world to the next
Human kindness2Embed
