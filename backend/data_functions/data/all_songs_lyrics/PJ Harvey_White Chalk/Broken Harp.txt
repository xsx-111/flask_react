Broken Harp LyricsPlease don't reproach me
For, for how empty
My life has become
I don't know what really happened
I watched your disappointment
At being misunderstood
I forgive you
Oh, something metal
Tearing my stomach out
If you think ill of me
Can you
Can you
Forgive me
Forgive me
Can you
Can you
Forgive me
Too
Too
I tried to learn your language
But fell asleep half undressed
Unrecognizable to myself3Embed
