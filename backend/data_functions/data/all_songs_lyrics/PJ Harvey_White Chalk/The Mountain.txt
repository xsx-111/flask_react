The Mountain Lyrics
Above the mountain
The mountain
An eagle
Is flying

High above the mountain
An eagle calling down
To the soldier who falters
The soldier on the ground

By the mountain
I feel nothing
For in my own heart
Every tree is broken

The first tree will not blossom
The second will not grow
The third is almost fallen
Since you betrayed me so

Since you1Embed
