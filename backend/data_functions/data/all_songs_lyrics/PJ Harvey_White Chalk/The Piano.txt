The Piano Lyrics
Hit her with a hammer
Teeth smashed in
Red tongues twitching
Look inside a skeleton

My fingers sting
Where I feel your fingers have been
Ghostly fingers
Moving my limbs

Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you

Daddy's in the corner
Rattling his keys
Mommy's in the doorway
Trying to leave

Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening

Nobody's listening
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss you
Oh god I miss youEmbed
