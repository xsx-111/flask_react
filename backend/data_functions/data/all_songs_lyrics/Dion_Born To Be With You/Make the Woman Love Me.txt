Make the Woman Love Me LyricsLord, I know I haven't asked for much
In such a long, long time
Not since that brand new pair of Levis
Back when I was eight or nine
And I know the world's in such a state
And you've got a lot to do
But if you ever find yourself
With a minute or two
Won't you please
Make the woman love me
Make the woman see
I'd be so good for her, Lord
If she'd just let me
Make the woman love me
Make the woman care
Just open up her heart, Lord
And I'll take it from there
Lord, I know that she needs me
It's just that she don't know
And my heart's so full of her
It's bound to overflow
Yeah
So if you should have a miracle
That you wanna do up right
Won't you take her by the hand, Lord
And show her the light
Show her the light
Won't you please
Make the woman love me
Make my baby see
I'd be so good for her
If she'd just let me
Lord, make the woman love me
Make the woman care
Just open up her heart Lord
And I'll take it from there
Just let my baby see, how sweet it would be
Please, make her see how sweet it could be
Oh make my baby love me
So, I said a little prayer
Please...Embed
