Only You Know LyricsI wanna see something that used to be in your eyes again
I'm waiting to see it, you know it's only a question of when
'Cause I know how much I'm missing, heaven
You know that it's missing
And only you know where you have been to
Only you know what you have been through
There's better things you're gonna get into
And I wanna be there too
Yes I do
I know it's not easy for you to start to believe again
And when the day comes don't let yourself be deceived again
'Cause I know that you've been waiting
It's such a long time that you've been waiting
And only you know where you have been to
Only you know what you have been through
There's better things you're gonna get into
And I wanna be there too
Ooh
'Cause I know that you've been waiting
Been such a long time you've been waiting
And only you know where you have been to
Only you know what you have been through
There's better things you're gonna get into
And I wanna be there too
You know I do5Embed
