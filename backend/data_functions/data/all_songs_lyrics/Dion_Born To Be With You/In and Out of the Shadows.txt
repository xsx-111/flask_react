In and Out of the Shadows LyricsIn and out of the shadows, at the highway of mistakes
When you get down, you get down to nowhere
You pay your respects, people, to higher stakes
In and out of the shadows, fake a smile and don't complain
Try and try, try not to take everything, people
That you see in vain, that you see in vain
Oh that scream in the middle of a dream
Tell me what does it mean for you or anybody
In and out of the shadows, baby, you ain't gonna fold
Even though somebody came and told you
The world all has long been bought and sold
Oh that scream in the middle of a dream
Tell me what does it mean for you or anybody
In and out of the shadows, there ain't no place you can hide
But you can try, try to be humble, people, in your pride
Deep inside, deep inside1Embed
