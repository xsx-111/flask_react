Born to Be with You LyricsBy, little girl, by your side, yeah
You keep me, you give me what I need, you keep me satisfied
Yes you do
Mmm, through and through, babe, yeah through
Little girl, little girl, I was born, born, born, born, born
To be with you
Yeah
Mmm, wondrously
Eternally
Did I ever tell you, little girl
How wonderful your love can be?
Yeah, baby
Yet I do, I know baby
Little girl, I was born, born, born, born, born
To be with you
Yeah, it's true
All life through, yeah baby
I was just born, born, born, born, born
Tell ya straight
I was born, born, born, born, born
Stars in the right place, baby
Born, born, born, born
To be with you
Yeah
Do, someone ask me, do I find
A little piece of mind, babe
You know I do, I love, love, loving you
Ooh, babe
Little girl I was born, born, born, born, born
To be with you
It's true, honey
Oh, all my life through
I was born, born, born, born, born
Was born, born, born, born, born
Yes I was born, born, born, born, born
To be with you
Yes it's true
Baby...Embed
