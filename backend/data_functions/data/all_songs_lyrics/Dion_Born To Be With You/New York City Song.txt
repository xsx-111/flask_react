New York City Song LyricsBright lights, the big city, went straight to my baby's head
She never listened to a word of what her daddy said
The music and the parties and the laughter turned her on
She lost herself in running
And all we had was gone
That's the year my dream died in New York City
That's the year I had to leave that town
That's the year, people, my dream died in New York City
That's the year I left without a sound
Bottles are all empty and we sang an awful song
Thank the lord that New York City people love the strong
I think of all the good times when my cup overflowed
Ain't it funny, baby
That we've taken different roads
That's the year my dream died in New York City
That's the year I had to leave that town
That's the year, people, my dream died in New York City
That's the year I left without a sound
There'll always be a little New York City in my heart
Though this country soul of mine I knew right from the start
Saints of stone are lonely in the old cathedral hall
Perhaps they knew before the rest that I had to leave it all
That's the year my dream died in New York City
That's the year I had to leave that town
That's the year, my dream died in New York City
That's the year I left without a sound
My dream died in New York City
That's the year I
That's the year my dream died in New York City
That's the year I had to leave that townEmbed
