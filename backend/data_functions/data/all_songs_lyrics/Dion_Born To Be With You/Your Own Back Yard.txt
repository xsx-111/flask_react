Your Own Back Yard LyricsI've been sitting here, thinking
About when I started in drinking
I went on to dope
It surely did change my life
I cried a tear in a beer for me
I lost everything near and dear to me
Namely my children and my wife
My idea of having a good time
Was sitting with my head between my knees
I knew everything there was to know
Everything except which way to go
I cried, oh, God, take me will you, please
Many a time I swore up and down
I didn't need any of this junk that was going round
I can quit; let me finish what I got
After all, this stuff sure costs a lot
Then I'll get my feet back on the ground
I can't tell nobody how to live their life
Even though inside we're all the same
All those things are toys I was playing with
You know we're all losers in that game, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now since I've been straight I haven't been in my cups
I'm not shooting downs, I'm not using ups
You know I'm still as crazy as a loon
Even though I don't run out and cop a spoon
But thank the good lord, God, I had enough
(Had enough)
Now, I got a friend, his name is Richard Grands
He says you don't need to be stoned to grow a friend
Believe me  you're all beautiful people just the way you are
Tell me, what has that stuff done for you so far, yeah
I've been sitting here thinking
Been winking, I been blinking
I don't have to sit around no more and nod
With my nose in the eggs, you know
I can do anything that I wanna do
I do it straight I do it so much better too
And it's, it's gotta start right in your own backyard
I said it's gotta start right in your own backyard
You know everybody has their own beautiful backyard
You might have oil wells in your own back yard
Yeah, your own backyard...Embed
