Plush Lyrics
And I feel that time's a wasted go
So where ya goin' 'til tomorrow?
And I see that these are lies to come
So would you even care?

And I feel it
And I feel it

Where ya goin' for tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

And I feel, so much depends on the weather
So is it rainin' in your bedroom?
And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray
So would you even care?

And I feel it
And she feels it
Where ya goin' for tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it

Where ya goin' for tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
To find it
To find it
To find it19Embed
