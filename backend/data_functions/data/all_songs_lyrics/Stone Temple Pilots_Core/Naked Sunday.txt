Naked Sunday Lyrics
Aaah, who-oh-oa, aaah, yeah
Aaah, who-oh-oa, aaah, yeah

You're the fuel to the fire
You're the weapons of war
You're the irony of justice
And the father of law

I've been waiting for awhile to meet you
For the chance to shake your hand
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command
And when all is over and we return to dust
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust?

Aaah, who-oh-oa, aaah, yeah
Aaah, who-oh-oa, aaah, yeah

You're the champion of sorrow
You're the love and the pain
You're the fighter of evil
Yet you're one in the same
I've been waiting for awhile to meet you
For the chance to shake your hand
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command
And when all is over and we return to dust
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust?

Aaah, who-oh-oa, aaah, yeah
Aaah, who-oh-oa, aaah, yeah

An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
Turnin' the other cheek aside
We all God's children, the giver of love
But only we will survive!

Aaah, who-oh-oa, aaah, yeah
Aaah, who-oh-oa, aaah, yeah
Aaah, who-oh-oa, aaah, yeah
Aaah, who-oh-oa, aaah, yeah1Embed
