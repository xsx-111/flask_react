Wet My Bed Lyrics
Hey everybody, where did Mary go?
Where did Mary go?
And where's my only cigarette?
Please think for me, I can't bear to
I'll just lie here for a while

Wet myself, wet my bed
I've readied it all for her, you know
Clean sheets, incense
And lots of fluffy pillows now soiled
Hey, where's my cigarette?

Did you check the bathroom, the bathtub?
She sleeps there sometimes
Water cleanses, you know
Washes dirt away, makes new

Maybe she
Maybe she
Maybe she
Maybe, maybe she swam away
Alright, now what?Embed
