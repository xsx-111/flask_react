Sin Lyrics
Holy-water
Clouds my thinking
Sinking low now
Keep on drinking

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

You control me
Soul you stole, mine
Wishful thinking
Six feet under

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

So feel what were my eyes
Sink into the holes in my eyes
My sins have made me blind
Sink into the holes in my eyes
Dead by dreaming
Sleep you steal, mine
Pools of cold sweat
Hatred burns me

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed
Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed
Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you
That followed you2Embed
