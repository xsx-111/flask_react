Crackerman Lyrics
Kicking as I'm trying to sleep
I got the mud beneath my shoes
Rubber band, rubber band, gun in hand, gun in hand
I wanna use

Roaming, roaming, roam
(Get away, gotta get away)
And I think I think too much
(I don't care, yeah and I don't care)
Roaming, roaming, roam
(Get away, gotta get away)
And I think I think too much

Tripping as I'm thinking
'Bout a boy, his name was Sue
He's a man, he's a man, crackerman, crackerman
He's a woman too

Roaming, roaming, roam
(Get away, gotta get away)
And I think I think too much
(I don't care, yeah and I don't care)
Roaming, roaming, roam
(Get away, gotta get away)
And I think I think too much
And I'm thinking
While I'm thinking
And I'm thinking
While I'm thinking


Roaming, roaming, roam
(Get away, gotta get away)
And I think I think too much
(I don't care, yeah and I don't care)
Roaming, roaming, roam
(Get away, gotta get away)
And I think I think too much

And I'm thinking
While I'm thinking
And I'm thinking
While I'm thinking

Salt cracked
Mud flaps
Dust blowing in my eyes
I'm a-roaming
I'm a-roaming
I'm a-roaming1Embed
