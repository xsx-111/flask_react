Piece of Pie Lyrics
Yeah!
Yeah!

I broke the breadline
Nobody knows
I walked the front-line
Still got far to go
I mixed the water
I drank the water
I broke the breadline
Don't wanna know

Yeah, yeah

It's staring me down
Wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around
Dressed like a clown
Don't know my name, you know where to find me

I killed the manchild
I'll fast alone
I had the midwife
Naked and alone
I mixed the water
I drank the water
I killed the brainchild
I'll fast alone
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

It's staring me down
Wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around
Dressed like a clown
Don't know my name, you know where to find me

Hey, don't wanna let me be a man
Hey, don't wanna lead me to your home
Don't wanna lead me to your, to your home


Yeah, yeah, yeah!

It's staring me down
Wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around
Dressed like a clown
Don't know my name, you know where to find me
I killed the man-child
I had the midwife
I drank the water, I stand alone
I broke the breadline
I walked the front-line
Don't know my name, you know where to find me

Hey, don't wanna let me be a man
Hey, don't wanna lead me to your home
Hey, don't wanna let me be a man
Hey, don't wanna lead me to your homeEmbed
