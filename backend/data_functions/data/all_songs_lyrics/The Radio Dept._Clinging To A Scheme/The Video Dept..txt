The Video Dept. Lyrics
I have kept your diary on tape
I've covered every angle of your face
From ear to ear and then you'd smile
And disappear for a while

Take me when you go out again
I want to buy some stuff from your friend
It's good to know we both still care
And that we have this to share

I have kept your diary on tape
I've covered every angle of your face
From ear to ear and then you'd smile
And disappear for a while4Embed
