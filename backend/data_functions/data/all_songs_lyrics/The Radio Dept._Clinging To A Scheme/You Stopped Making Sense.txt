You Stopped Making Sense LyricsYou stopped making sense
You stopped making sense
You forgot about your friends
I wanna come closer
I wanna come closer
I wanna come closer
I wanna come closer
That's all I want
Since you let God in
You believe in sin
But of course there's no such thing
Just like there's no Santa
No equality before the law
No people without flaws
You forgot all about us
And for what cause?
You believe the lie
Saying you won't die
I know you were scared but so am I
That's why I can't lose you
Whatever they told you
I'm dying to hold you
Don't let them blindfold you
Don't say goodbyeEmbed
