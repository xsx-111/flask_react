Never Follow Suit LyricsI want to
You knew that I would want to
It makes me feel bad
But I've been waiting for a long time
I want to
Yes I've wanted to
Long before you
I want to
And I've been waiting for a long time
I want to
I always wanted to belong to
The freak scene
Or anyone who had set their mind to
Never follow suit again
Because they have to
I want to
I always wanted to belong to
:
Every time I get on a train
Almost everyday I see my name
I'll say:
"yeah y'know I was there, I bombed it"
It's for me, it's not for nobody else to see
I don't care about nobody else seeing it
All these other people who don't write
They're excluded
I don't care about them
They don't matter to me
It's for us
It's for us
You want to
You said you didn't want to
It makes me feel bad
Because I could never bring you
You want to
You wanted to
But never dared to
You want to now
But I've been waiting for a long time
We will never follow suit
We will never follow suit
We will always stay off route1Embed
