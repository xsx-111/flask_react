David LyricsAsleep for twenty years with this feeling
But I was on your side
And he's spent some 20 years with this feeling
Of being lost inside
He was lost inside
Of his mind
Just like I've been holding on for all our lives
All our lives
Oh David won't you look into my
He turned too many heads for one lifetime
He never had to try
And he stained too many beds for one lifetime
But always asking why
Always asking why, why
Just like I've been doing up until tonight
Why
Just like I've been doing David all my life
All my life
Oh David, won't you look into my
Oh David won't you look into my eyes
Oh David won't you look into my eyes
Oh David won't you look into my eyes1Embed
