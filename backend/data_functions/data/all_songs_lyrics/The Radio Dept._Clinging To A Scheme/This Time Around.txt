This Time Around Lyrics
You're young like tonight
And to be young is to be right
You never had to prove your loyalty
Now you want to know when I'm off my hunger strike
You were always treated like royalty

You say it's not a song
That will prove them wrong
This time around

You feel old like the fight
Learning new ways to be right
And how to cope with disloyalty

It's not a song
That will prove them wrong
This time around

All the things we hoped for
They are gone
They have sailed across the sea
And all the things we tried for
They're gone
They're gone this time around
This time around
You're young like tonight
And to be young is to be right
You never had to prove your loyalty
But we dreamt of a war
On that night and in that car
We made a promise, do you recall?

It's not a song
That will prove them wrong
This time around

All the things we hoped for
They are gone
They have sailed across the sea
And all the things we tried for
They're gone
They're gone this time around
This time around1Embed
