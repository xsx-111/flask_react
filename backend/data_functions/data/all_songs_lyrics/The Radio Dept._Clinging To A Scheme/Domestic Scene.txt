Domestic Scene LyricsDomestic scene
What's missing here?
Leaving just in time
Social climbers at the frontier
But I refuse that climb
We're leaving just in time
We're leaving just in time
Leaving just in time
Domestic scene
Did I belong?
Seemed like a good idea
At one time
But now it's all wrong
Already declined
We're leaving just in time
We're leaving just in time
Leaving just in time
Leaving just in time
Leaving just in time
Leaving just in time
Leaving just in time1Embed
