Little Girl LyricsYou're gonna be mine, little girl, you've been through 18 years of pain
You're gonna be mine, little girl, you've been through 18 years of pain
I'm gonna give you a love, child, you won't feel bad again
You've been mistreated, little girl, but I swear, I swear it'll be outgrown
You've been mistreated, little girl, but I swear, I swear it'll be outgrown
I'm gonna give you a love, child, something you've never known
You're gonna be mine, little girl, even if I can't have you by my side
You're gonna be mine, little girl, even if I can't have you by my side
You're gonna remember the love, child, that made you satisfied1Embed
