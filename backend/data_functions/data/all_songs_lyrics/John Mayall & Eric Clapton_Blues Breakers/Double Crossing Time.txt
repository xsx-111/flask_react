Double Crossing Time LyricsIt's a mean old scene
When it comes to double crossing time
It's a mean old scene
When it comes to double crossing time
When you think you got good buddies
They will spin around and cheat you blind
Double crossing man is mean
He will try to make it so you lose
Double crossing man
He will try to make it so you lose
You'll fill your mind with worry
You know he hurt me with the bluesEmbed
