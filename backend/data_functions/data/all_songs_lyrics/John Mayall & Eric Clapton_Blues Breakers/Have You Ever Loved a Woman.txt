Have You Ever Loved a Woman LyricsHave you ever loved a woman
So much it hurts to be alone
Have you ever loved a woman
So much it hurts to be alone
And all the time you know that little girl will do you wrong
But you just love that woman
So much that you tremble in pain
When you just love that woman
So much you tremble in pain
And the part that hurts so bad
Is you know ya never gonna see her again
Have you ever loved a woman
So much that it hurts to be alone
Have you ever loved a woman
So much that it hurts to be alone
While all the time you know
You don't wanna break up your happy homeEmbed
