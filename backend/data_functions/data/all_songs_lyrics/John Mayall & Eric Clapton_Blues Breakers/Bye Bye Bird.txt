Bye Bye Bird LyricsYeah, we know these sounds
These sounds belong to one man
One man from Mississippi, USA
One man known as the wizard of the harp
One man known as the menace
And his name is Sonny Boy Williamson
Bye bye bird
Bye bye bird
Bye bye bird
Bye bye bird
Bye bye bird, I'm gone
Bird, I'm gone
Bird, I'm gone
Bird, I'm gone
Bird, I'm gone
I'm gone, (child, you find)
