It Hurts to Be in Love LyricsThe fire that burns deep down in me
The pleasure of pain that aches constantly
That is love baby! It is a real true thing
And I know it's hard to believe but it
It hurts to be in love
You hear me
The love that you know
It's wrapped in a seal
The joy from your heart, girl
It seems so unreal
But that is love
It's a real true thing
It's hard to believe sometime
But it hurts to be in love
You see the tears
Fall from my eyes
You have to be in love
To know the reason why
The joy and the pain
That all of us feel
Are a part of thing
That makes your love so real
Although your arms
Are holding me tight
The sadness you feel girl
It just don't seem right
That is love
Yeah it's a real true thing
Yeah it is aha
You know what
It's hard to believe, but it
It hurts to be in love
And I'm not lying either
Oh I told you
Now give it to me
You see the tears
Fall from my eyes
You have to be in love
To know the reason why
The joy and the pain
That all of us feel
Are a part of thing
That makes your love so real
Although your arms
Are holding me tight
The sadness you feel girl
It just don't seem right
That is love baby
Oh it's a real true thing
It's hard to believe
But it hurts to be in love
You hear me? All right
How can it hurt you to be in love?
I don't know. But I know this
You can do what you wanna do baby
I'm not gonna stop loving you
You you
I must be crazy
All this pain to be in love
Baby
What is this thing called love?
Tell me woman
If you love me like you say
Why you treat me like you do
Look it girl! Said you got my number
Why don't you call me off sometime baby
Please oh baby!Embed
