Crawling Up a Hill LyricsEvery morning (a)bout half past eight
My Mummer wakes me says
"Don't be late"
Get to the office, tryin' to concentrate
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill
So I stop one day to figure it out
I'll quit my job without a shadow of a doubt
To sing the blues that I know about
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill
Minute after minute
Second after second
Hour after hour goes by
Working for a rich girl
Staying just a poor girl
Never stop to wonder why
So here I am in London town
A better scene I'm gonna be around
The kind of music that won't bring me down
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill
Every morning (a)bout half past eight
My Mummer wakes me says
"Don't be late"
Get to the office, tryin' to concentrate
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill
So I stop one day to figure it out
I'll quit my job without a shadow of a doubt
To sing the blues that I know about
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill
Minute after minute
Second after second
Hour after hour goes by
Working for a rich girl
Staying just a poor girl
Never stop to wonder why
So here I am in London town
A better scene I'm gonna be around
The kind of music that won't bring me down
Life is just a slow train
So here I am in London town
A better scene I'm gonna be around
The kind of music that won't bring me down
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hillEmbed
