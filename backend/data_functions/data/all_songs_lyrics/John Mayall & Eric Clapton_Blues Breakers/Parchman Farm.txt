Parchman Farm LyricsI'm sitting over here on Parchman Farm
I'm sitting over here on Parchman Farm
I'm sitting over here on Parchman Farm
Ain't never done no man no harm
Well, I'm putting that cotton in an 11 foot sack
Well, I'm putting that cotton in an 11 foot sack
Well, I'm putting that cotton in an 11 foot sack
A twelve-gauge shotgun at my back

I'm sitting over here on Parchman Farm
I'm sitting over here on Parchman Farm
I'm sitting over here on Parchman Farm
Ain't never done no man no harmEmbed
