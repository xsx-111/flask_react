Telephone Blues LyricsI couldn't sleep last night
I was sittin' by my telephone
All the time wastin'
All the love you've never shown
But someday, someday darlin'
You will realise I'm alone
The last time I saw you
You promised me you'd come call
But time is runnin' out babe
You never call at all
But life's so long babe lonely
Sittin' by my telephone
But someday, someday darlin'
You will realise I'm aloneEmbed
