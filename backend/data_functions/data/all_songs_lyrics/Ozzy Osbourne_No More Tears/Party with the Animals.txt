Party with the Animals Lyrics
Into the night I've got to go
That's when the juices start to flow
Everything will be alright
I might be blind but I can see
I got the power inside of me
Everything will be alright
I'm never going to crack under a witch's spell
Never put her chains on me
I'm never going to break it, no I'll never tell
I know she'll never let me be

Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed, no more

I like it fast, I like it slow
There's no direction I couldn't go
Everything will be alright
I like it loud, I like it mean
I got the thunder in my machine
Everything will be alright
Dancing with disaster is a part of me
I'm never going to let it go
Don't know what I'm after I'm deserting me
The secret that I'll never know
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed, no more
No more, no more, yeah, baby, I like it girl
No more, no more, no more, yeah, baby, I like it girl

Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowedEmbed
