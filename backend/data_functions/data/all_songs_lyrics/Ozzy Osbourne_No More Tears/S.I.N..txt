S.I.N. Lyrics
A psycho driver twisted in my head
Silence broken but there's nothing said
I got a nightmare from a fantasy
Will the voices ever set me free?

I can hear 'em, I can hear 'em
Someone wake me when it's over
I can see 'em, I can see 'em
I can see 'em over and over again

I saw it happening like déjà vu
They tried to tell me but they couldn't get through
In my head I hear the voices scream
I need someone to tell me what it means

I can hear 'em, I can hear 'em
Someone wake me when it's over
I can see 'em, I can see 'em
I can see 'em over and over again

Woah, who turned off the lights?
Woah, a shadow in the night
Woah, It wasn't meant to be
I can't take this alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight
No, no, I can't make it alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight, yeah
Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass
I wonder if tonight will be my last
I need an angel who can rescue me
To save me from my mental symphony

I can hear 'em, I can hear 'em
Someone wake me when it's over
I can see 'em, I can see 'em
I can see 'em over and over again, yeah

Woah, who turned off the lights?
Woah, shadows in the night
Woah, It wasn't meant to be
I can't take this alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight
No, no, I can't make it alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight, yeahEmbed
