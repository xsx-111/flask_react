Sickness Lyrics(One, two, three, four)
Hey, little girl, you're black and blue
Hey, little girl, you're six foot two
I know a man who loved too hard
He lost his mind, it wasn't hard
Over this sickness, over this sickness
Over this sickness, this sickness of love
Cute little knees that you got
Out in the dark parking lot
Cute little voice whispering
I know a man lost everything
Over this sickness, over this sickness
Over this sickness, this sickness of love
This sickness is hauntin' me till I cannot see
This sickness is what I am
I greet it like a friend, amen
Hey, little girl, I'm almost trough
Hey, little girl, I'm almost you
Hey, little girl, the river runs
Hey, little girl, the rising sun
Over this sickness, over this sickness
Over this sickness, this sickness of love
(This sickness, this sickness, this sickness)
Over this sickness, over this sickness, over this sickness
Over this sickness, over this sickness
Over this sickness, this sickness of loveEmbed
