Highway Song LyricsI been walkin' down the road, what it means I dunno
I been walkin' down the highway with the bad food flyin' by me
I'm an ordinary man with a time bomb in my hand
It keeps tickin' an I keep running, trying to find out where I come from
And there ain't nothin' gonna take this road away
There ain't nothin' gonna take this road away
Nothin' gonna take this road outta my heart
And there ain't nothin' gonna take this road away
Nothin' gonna take this road away
Nothin' gonna take this road outta my heart
I wake up sweating in the night, every town is only lights
I'm addicted to the highway 'cause I just can't do things their way
And there ain't nothin' gonna take this road away
There ain't nothin' gonna take this road away
Nothin' gonna take this road outta my heart
And there ain't nothin' gonna take this road away
There ain't nothin' gonna take this road away
There ain't nothin' gonna take this pain outta my heart
Highway, I'm doin fine, you help me draw the line
No use in bein' alive if I'm just renting
I undersand the circus well, I've played the clown when down he fell
But bein' down ain't bein' loser, so just look out, here comes a bruiser
And there ain't nothin' gonna take my road away
There ain't nothin' gonna take my road away
There ain't nothin' gonna take my road outta my heart
And there ain't nothin' gonna take my road away
There ain't nothin' gonna take my pain away
There ain't nothin' gonna take my road outta my heart
And there ain't nothin' gonna take my road away
And there ain't nothin' gonna take my road away
And there ain't nothin' gonna take my road away
And there ain't nothin' gonna take my pain away, awayEmbed
