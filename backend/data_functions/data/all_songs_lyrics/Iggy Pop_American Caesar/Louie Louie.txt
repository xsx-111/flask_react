Louie Louie LyricsAnd now...the news:
Yeah!
Louie Louie, whoa baby
I gotta go now
Louie Louie, whoa-oh baby
I really gotta go now
The Communist world is fallin' apart
The capitalists are just breakin' hearts
Money is the reason to be
It makes me just wanna sing Louie Louie
Louie Louie, whoa baby
I gotta go now
Louie Louie, whoa-oh baby
I really gotta go now
There's a fine little girl, she's waitin' for me
But I'm as bent as Dostoevsky
I think about the meaning of my life again
And I have to sing Louie Louie again
Louie Louie, whoa baby
I gotta go now
Louie Louie, whoa-oh baby
I really gotta go now
Let's give it to' em right now!

Spoken:
Oh man, I dunno, like...man, like you know
I don't know, health insurance and the homeless and world peace
And...AIDS...and education... I mean, uh, I'm trying to do right, but...hey
Life after Bush and Gorbachev
The wall is down, but something is lost
Turn on the news, it looks like a movie
It makes me wanna sing Louie Louie
Louie Louie, whoa baby
I gotta go now
Louie Louie, whoa-oh baby
I really gotta go now
Say I gotta go now!
I gotta go now!
I really gotta go now!
Let's go!Embed
