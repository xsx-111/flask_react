Girls of N.Y. LyricsThere are People there trying so hard to find a face. There's a little store on 9th street that does a complete transvestite makeover. There's people who sew, people who blow, there's Jewish Poets and some who don't know it, there's Blacks with an axe, pretty girls with an ex
The streets are alive with a rushing river that never dies. The boys and girls come in so clean teaching out their little hands towards that dream. People from everywhere, jamaicans, puerto ricans, englishmen, spaniards, japanese, portuguese, argentines, norwegians and swedes and forget me, from Detroit city, yeah

Walking down the Street like she knows where she's going, those old clothes and that new body with just a little hint of dirt in her eye, cracks start to show through the make-up but the girl's got character, the girl's got soul, that's the kind of girl i wanna know.
