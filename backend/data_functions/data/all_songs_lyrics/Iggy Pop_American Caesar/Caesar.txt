Caesar LyricsPeople of America, I bring you a great army
To preserve peace in our empire
Throw them to the lions
Darling, let us go to the banquet hall
There will be a great feast tonight
Who are these Christians?
What is this strange religion?
I've heard it said they turn the other cheek
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Throw them to the lions, throw them to the lions
Throw them to the lions, thumbs down
10 pieces of gold for every man
Hail Caesar, hail Caesar
Grapes from Sicily, silks from Asia minor
All the tea in China
Throw them to the lions, throw them to the lions
Throw them to the lions, who are these Christians?
Turn the other cheek, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Two thumbs down, the Christians are restless
Why not let them worship their god?
No one believes in the old gods
How tiresome attending the rituals
Paying lip service to the portents
Burning incense at their shrine
No one believes in the old gods
Throw them to the lions, throw them to the lions
Throw them to the lions, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
The roman empire the glory of Rome, hail, all hail
"Caesar, Caesar, beware beware the ides of march"
Who is this man? Caesar, he is but a soothsayer
He is old and his brain is addled, pay him no mind
Throw him to the lions! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Hail Caesar! emperor of Rome hail Caesar!
Caesar, Caesar, beware the ides of march
Eh?! who is this man?
Caesar, he is but an old soothsayer
Addled in his brain, pay him no mind
Throw him to the lions! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Throw him to the lions!
No one believes in the old gods
The empire is tired, Caesar will rest now
We depart for my chambers
Come darling, "yes, Caesar"
Caesar will rest now
Hail Rome, hail Caesar, hail
Put him in the fiery pit
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
(Uh, we got there, right? Okay, good. If I call for more numbers like that on the rec, I'll pick this record piece, yeah, all we got that.)Embed
