Character LyricsWell
I'll tell you
One good thing at least about some
Of these junkies was
They had some character
They may have driven me nuts
Sometimes & screwed up
But at least when they played
The damn guitar they'd play it
Like they meant it -
These white bread boys nowadays
Knowin' all the score
Don't even know how to pukeEmbed
