Perforation Problems LyricsI got a secret you can live and learn
I got a secret you can live and learn
You don't know me but I burn
You don't know me but I burn
Deep in your gut you know the right way out
Deep in your gut you know the right way out
Not like those guys who mess around
Not like those guys who fake it now
Perforation problems not all right
Hanging on a needle out of spite
Perforation problems no one home
Stumbling like a dirty slave in anger
I got a worm down in my troubled soul
I got a worm down in my troubled soul
Now I'm all right but there's still holes
Now I'm all right but there's still holes
Every time I think it was my last
Every time I hoped it was my last
I watched my future become my past
I watched my future become my past
Perforation problems not all right
Hanging on a needle outta fright
Perforation problems no one home
Stumbling like a dirty slave, in anger
I still get angry when I look back
I still get angry when I look back
When I look ahead my bags are packed
When I look ahead my bags are packed
Perforation problems not all right
Hanging on a needle out of fright
Perforation problems no one home
Stumbling like a dirty slave
Perforation problems not all right
Perforation problems every night
Perforation problems no one home
Stumbling like a dirty slave
Perforation problems not all right
Hanging on a needle out of spite
Perforation problems no one home
Stumbling like a dirty slave, yeah!Embed
