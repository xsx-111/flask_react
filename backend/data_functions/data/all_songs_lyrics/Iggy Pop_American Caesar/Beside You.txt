Beside You LyricsI been hungry way down in my heart waiting for a reason
I been hungry like a lot of guys, I want to be beside you
Lonely people pass me in the street waiting for a reason
Beside you grey is turning to blue
You wake up love in me
Beside you everything is new
You wake up love in me
I been hungry way down where it hurts waiting for a reason
I been hungry like a lot of guys, I want to be beside you
Beside you grey is turning to blue
You wake up love in me
Beside you everything is new
You wake up love in me
What a world, I really need you, girl
You wake up love in me
Beside you grey is turning to blue
You wake up loye in me
Beside you, beside you, I want to be beside you
Beside you, beside you, I want to be beside you
I want to be beside you, I want to be beside you
(I want to be beside you, I want to be beside you)Embed
