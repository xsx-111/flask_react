Plastic & Concrete LyricsPlastic & concrete, baby, these are the facts of life
I'm a nightmare child stuck on my own knife
I'm glad my mother loved me, I'm sick & paranoid
The hotel generater hums into the void of plastic & concrete
(Yeah)
Plastic & concrete, baby, I gotta learn to slow down
Somethin new from chemistry is jackin my brain around
I have got the plastic and I have got the stone
Out there in the suburbs I learned to be alon in plastic & concrete
Plastic & concrete sandwich, you'd like to eat me
But later you'll reject me, I'm too much to bite off
The salad on my outside is made of suicide
The guy who squirts my mayonnaise is on a one-way ride
In plastic & concrete, plastic & concrete
Plastic & concrete, plastic & concreteEmbed
