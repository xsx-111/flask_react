Hate LyricsAn evil look that tells me to fuck off
From the one who'll never treat me soft
I start to boil and to concentrate
On images of anger and of hate
These are the ways I feed my hate
These are the lights that burn too late
These are the ways I feed my hate
These are the lights that burn too late
The mean stupidity of what he says
The millions who admire it and they spread
And all I wanta feel is just them dead
And have to eat the things they did and said
These are the ways I feed my hate
These are the lights that burn so late
These are the ways I feed my hate
These are the lights that burn too late
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Why am I afraid? Why am I afraid?
Why am I afraid? Why am I afraid?
Afraid! Afraid! Afraid! Afraid!

Heh-heh-heh, heh-heh, heh-heh, heh-heh, heh-heh, hehEmbed
