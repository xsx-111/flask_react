Jealousy LyricsHe's got a great bit hit
He's in a limousine
When I see his face
Somethin' starts to freeze
He's got money for miles
His girl comes out of VOGUE
When he acts like an ass
He's treated like a rogue
I feel it comin' it's flushin' my face
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
I feel it comin' it's boilin' my blood
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
I feel it comin' flushin' my face
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
I feel it comin' boilin' my blood
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
This isn't for the first time in my life
She comes from top cheekbones
She never worried hard
You could camp an army
On her family's yard
When I look at blue blood
I want to make it mud
And tear that difference down
Rock an' roll is how
I feel it comin' it's breakin' my neck
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
I feel it comin' boilin' my blood
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
I feel it comin' boilin' my blood
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
I feel it comin' breakin' my neck
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
This isn't for the first time in my life
I feel it comin' it's flushin' my face
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
I feel it comin' boilin' my blood
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
I feel it comin' breakin' my neck
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
I feel it comin' heatin' my eyes
I feel it comin' jealousy baby
Jealousy babyEmbed
