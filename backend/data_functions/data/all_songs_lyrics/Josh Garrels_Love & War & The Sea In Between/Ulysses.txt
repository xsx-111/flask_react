Ulysses Lyrics
I’m holding on to the hope that one day this could be made right
Cause I’ve been shipwrecked and left for dead and I've seen the darkest sights
Everyone I’ve loved seems like a stranger in the night
But Oh my heart still burns, tells me to return, and search the fading light

I’m sailing home to you I won't be long
By the light of moon I will press on
Until I find my love

Trouble has beset my ways, and wicked winds have blown
Sirens call my name, they say they’ll ease my pain, then break me on the stones
But true love is the burden that will carry me back home
Carry me with the memories of the beauty I have known

I’m sailing home to you I won't be long
By the light of moon I will press on

So tie me to the mast of this old ship and point me home
Before I lose the one I love, before my chance is gone
I want to hold her in my arms8Embed
