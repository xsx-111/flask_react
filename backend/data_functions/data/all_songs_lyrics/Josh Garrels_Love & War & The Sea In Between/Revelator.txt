Revelator Lyrics

Had a dream I was alone
A vast expanse of complete unknown
Sea of glass so clear it shown
Like gold
Then a Voice like thunder clapped
As a dead man, I collapsed
"I am the first, I am the last
Now, rise my son"

Then behold, ten thousand kings
And every creature worshiping
Every eye was on one thing
One Man
He's like a lion, like a lamb
As though slain, He holds the plan
To make war and peace with man
And reign on earth

Holy, Holy, is the One
Who was and is, and is to come
In a robe as red as blood
He comes forth
Ride like lightning in the sky
On the war horse He draws nigh
The same One we crucified
Will return again

Holy, Holy, is the One
Who was and is, and is to come
In a robe as red as blood
He comes forth
Ride like lightning in the sky
On the war horse He draws nigh
The same One we crucified
Will return againEmbed
