Million Miles Lyrics
Feel the wind blow
Through the window, I know
That we’ll make it through
It’s a million miles from
Where we begun, and I
I still love you

I remember
As clear as ever, the day
When we first met
Lord, You know I
L love to hold her eyes, in mine
Everyday since

And everyday and night
Together we will grow
Makin' the most of a life
As we hold each other clo-o-o-o-o-ose

And as we grow old
May it be told, that we
Never lost our flame
If love’s a fire
Then my desire, is to bu-u-u-u-urn
Untamed
And everyday and night
Together we will grow
Makin' the most of a life
As we hold each other clo-o-o-o-o-ose2Embed
