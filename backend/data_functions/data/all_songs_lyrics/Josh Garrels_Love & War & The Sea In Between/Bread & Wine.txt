Bread & Wine LyricsI was wrong, everybody needs someone, to hold on
Take my hand, I’ve been a lonesome man, took a while to understand
There's some things we can’t live without
A man’s so prone to doubt
Faithful are the wounds of friends
So give it just a little time
Share some bread and wine
Weave your heart into mine
My friend
Walls fall down, where there’s a peaceful sound, lonely souls hang around
Don’t be shy, there’s nothing left to hide, come on let’s talk a while
Of the places we left behind
No longer yours and mine
But we could build a good thing here too
So give it just a little time
Share some bread and wine
Weave your heart into mine
And if I fall, I fall alone, but you can help to bear the load
A threefold chord is hard to break
And all I have I give to you if you will share your sorrows too
Then joy will be the crown upon our heads
My friend2Embed
