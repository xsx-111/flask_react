Slip Away LyricsHold on, before I slip away
The flames gone, dark I am afraid
How strong, is flesh and blood
I cannot take back what I’ve done
To you, my sweetest friend
I betrayed you, I walked away again
Now all that’s left, is what might have been
Please forgive me, before we reach the end
Hold on, before I slip away
My loves gone cold, I’ve gone astray
How strong, is flesh and blood
I cannot take back what I’ve doneEmbed
