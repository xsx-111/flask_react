Flood Waters LyricsHigher than the yonder mountain and deeper than the sea
From the breadth of the east unto the west
Is the love that started with a seed
Stronger than the wildest horses and the rising tide
The chords of death hung so heavy round our necks
Will be left at the great divide
Flood waters rise, but it won't wash away
Love never dies, it will hold on more fierce than graves
Farther than the pale moon rises on the open plains
Past the time and the longest blood line
There shines an immortal flame
Somewhere in between forever and the passing days
Thereâ€™s a place moth and rust cannot lay waste
This is grace, the face of love
Flood waters rise, but it won't wash away
Love never dies, it will hold on more fierce than graveEmbed
