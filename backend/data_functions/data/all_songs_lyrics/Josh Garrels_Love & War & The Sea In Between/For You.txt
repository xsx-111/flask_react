For You LyricsWell I got so much I’m dying to tell you
But you can’t bear to hear me now
In a little while I must move on
But I’ll send my love to you
And you can, call my name
And I will find you
Heaven and Hell can’t separate our love
I’m doing it all for you my love
And I’ll come back
Yeah I’ll come back
Yeah I’ll come back for you
