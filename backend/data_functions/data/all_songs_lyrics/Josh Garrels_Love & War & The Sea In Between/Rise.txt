Rise Lyrics
I hung my head, for the last time
In surrender and despair
Before I’m dead, I’ll take the last climb
Up the mountain, face my fears
The time has come, to make a choice
Use my voice for the love of every man
My minds made up, never again
Never again, will I turn 'round

Though they may surround me like lions
And crush me on all sides
I may fall, but I will rise
Not by my might, or my power, or by the strength of swords
Only through, Your love, my Lord
All that's lost, will be, restored

Take courage sons, for we must go under
The heart of darkness, and set them free
But don’t lose heart when you see the numbers
There’s no measure for the faith we bring
And it’s given us to overcome
If we run, where the Spirit calls us on
The greatest things, have yet to come
With the dawn, we will rise
Though they may surround us like lions
And crush us on all sides
We may fall, but we will rise
Not by my might, or my power, or by the strength of swords
Only through, Your love, my Lord
All that's lost, will be, restoredEmbed
