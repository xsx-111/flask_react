Hearing Voices Lyrics
Got home kind of late last night
My mind wasn't clear, but I could tell something wasn't right
So silent I could hear my heart pump
But then I heard a sound that made me jump
I tried to get real brave, tried to look around
I tried to find out from where came that sound
The more I looked, the less I could see
But the voices keep calling, calling out of me

I hear voices - when I'm all alone
Hearing voices - but there's nobody home
Hear the voices - could it be they're calling out of me
Hearing voices - I look, why can't I see?
I hear voices - can't stop those voices

It happened again the very next day
I still couldn't understand what they were tryin' to say
Could only get the courage to open up one eye
Couldn't see nothing, but the voices they don't lie
I searched and searched but not a soul I found
I'm pretty damn sure no one was around
The more I looked, the less I could see
Then I released the voices were calling from me
I hear voices - when I'm all alone
Hearing voices - but there's nobody home
Hear the voices - could it be they're calling out of me
Hearing voices - I look, why can't I see?
Are they demons?
Or are they angels?
YEEEAAAAAAHHHH

Now the voices I start to understand
They have to do with the Master Plan
You think about what you'd do
Cause one day the voices will be calling out to you
The voices I hear now I know are true
They come not from one but they come from two
The real point is what I'm missing
From which voice will I listen?

I hear voices
Hearing voices
Do you hear the voices?
Can't stop the voices
NOOOOOOOOOOOEmbed
