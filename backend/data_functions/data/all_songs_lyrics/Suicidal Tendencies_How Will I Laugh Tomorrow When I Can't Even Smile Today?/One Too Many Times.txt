One Too Many Times LyricsNever good at talking, so many things I couldn't say
But those thoughts never went away
And I'm sure you remember, said that all I wanted was sympathy
Now add this to your memory
Too many times-I felt so sad and lonely
Too many times-I needed someone there
Too many times-I tried to tell you something
Too many times-It seemed like no one cared
And I don't like asking-and it's not easy to say...
I never learned how to pray
So if you have a moment it means so much to me oh can't you see...
If you'd just say a prayer for me
Too many times-I didn't even have a second
Too many times-you thought I was much too strong
Too many times-you said the feeling wouldn't last forever
Too many times-I proved you so damn wrong
Well you saw the changes-thought they'd go away-do you still remember that day
Can't really fault you-only have myself to blame...
But do you still feel the same
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?
But I waited so long-for someone to take my hand, and say they understand
And I waited so long-for someone to show the way-to make a better day
And I waited so long-for someone to spare a kiss for the love I miss
And I waited so long-for you to look me in the eye
And say it's worth another try
But you keep me waiting-waiting-too many times
You keep me waiting, one too many, one too many, one too many times
Too many times
One too many one too many one too many times too many times
Can't you see yo keep me waiting-one too many timesEmbed
