How Will I Laugh Tommorrow Lyrics
Here I sit and watch my world
Come crumbling down
I cry for help but no one's around
Silently screaming as I bang my head
Against the wall
It seems like no one cares at all
Always an emotion
But how could I explain?
How can I explain?
Kind of like the scent of a rose
With words I can't explain
The same with my pain
Caught up in emotion
Goes over my head
Goes over my head
Sometimes I got to think to myself
"Is this life or death?
Am I living or am I dead?"
The clock keeps ticking
But nothing else seems to change
Problems never solved, just rearranged
And when I think about
All the times that I've had
Some were good, most were bad
I search for personality
And I look for things I cannot see
Love and peace flash through my mind
Pain and hate is all I find
Find no hope in nothing new
And I never had a dream come true
Lies and hate and agony
And through my eyes that's all I see
If I'm gonna cry
Will you wipe away my tears?
If I'm gonna die
Lord, please take away my fear
Before I drown in sorrow
Well I just want to say
How will I laugh tomorrow
If I can't even smile today?
Today, today, today
When I can't even smile today
Today, today, today
When I can't even smile today
How will I laugh tomorrow
When I can't even smile today?
How will I laugh tomorrow
When I can't even smile today?
You think something's funny?
Laugh at this!
So when I look outside my room
I see the world, but not the reason
What is done to me is not fair
You call it fair, I call it treason
But I know not what to do
Give me a sign I'll take whatever
But if you want me here I am
Ain't gonna die forever
And I tried to hold ya
But you just turned away
And I tried to tell ya
But not a word I say
I cried out so loudly
But you just covered your ears
And gave me all the signs
That you ignored my tears
So if you want me here I am
I sit here waiting your decision
But my body fights my mind
I'm headed straight for a collision
So am I getting near or am I still
Looking in all the wrong places?
But the only thing that seems to change
Are the looks on the faces

Doesn't anyone?
Seems like no one cares at all
I search for personality
And look for things I cannot see
(Does anyone even care at all?)
Love and peace flash through my mind
Pain and hate is all I find
(Seems like no one cares at all)
Find no hope in nothing new
When I never had a dream come true
(Does anyone even care at all?)
Lies and hate and agony
Through my eyes that's all I see
(Seems like no one cares at all)
How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow
When I can't even smile today?
Today, today
When I can't even smile today
Today, today
When I can't even smile today
How will I laugh tomorrow
When I can't even smile today?
How will I laugh tomorrow
When I can't even smile today?Embed
