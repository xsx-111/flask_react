Trip at the Brain LyricsTrippin
I gotta gotta take a trip, gotta take a trip out of this place
I gotta gotta get away, get away from the human race
I don't know what I'll see, don't even know what I'll find
I don't know what to pack, never been to a trip at the mind
Chorus:
Trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
Do you know what I'm saying?
Trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
Well, I'm going insane
I took a wrong turn and I ended up at my heart
It could barely even pump no blood it was so thrashed and torn apart
Thank it for working overtime in pain and misery
Then I set back on the trail, headed for my destiny
Chorus:
Trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
Do you know what I'm saying?
Trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
Well, I'm going insane
Well, fly with me
Flying free
Tripping
You must be tripping
Trip, trip, trip, trip, tripping
Tripping
I cannot stop this trip, I forgot to pack the brakes
Crashed straight into a concrete wall of my mistakes
Ended up in a cemetary of a thousand wasted days
But that's alright with me, 'cause that's where most of my memory lays
Gotta get away…
Gotta get away…
I'm gonna take that trip
Welcome
'cause I'm the host with the most
Now here's a little toast
Take your messages and put you're mind on coast
I'll exorcise your fears
Make your nightmares disappear
You can talk all you want
But nothing do I really hear
A situation, this operation
A simple demonstration in experimentation
I slip, trip, slip, trip every little dip
There's nothing like a lobotomy
To keep a person free of pain
Financial gain
For your personal pain
Well it's so insane
But won't you keep all the pain
And slip, fly, trip
Got caught up in another trap
So pay another shrink
Buy his wife another mink
Let me tell what I think think
I think, I think...
I Gotta, gotta get away gotta get away, gotta get away
I'm just trippin' trippin' trippin'
Never volatile, wanna sin with me?
You gotta get away, they say they're gonna freak
But that's between the cheek, gotta trip, gotta trip, gotta trip, gotta...
Gotta make a sound
It's a dance mom
Gotta take a trip, gotta take a trip
The real trip ain't about gettin' hip
Gotta trip
Tripa tripa tripa tripa ha
Sins go slam, goin down at the chest
Gotta get away gotta get away away
Gotta trip with no permission, mind evaluation
Take your head, add a little crazy
Take that trip to the brain
Take that trip to the brain
Everybody gotta get get off
You gotta gotta gotta take the trip to the brain!Embed
