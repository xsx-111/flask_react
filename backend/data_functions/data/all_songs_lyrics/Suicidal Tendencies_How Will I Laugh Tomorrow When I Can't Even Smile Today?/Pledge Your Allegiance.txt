Pledge Your Allegiance Lyrics

I never said I don't like religion, I just don't like TV
You say I got a bad attitude, around you that comes naturally
You say I need more compassion, I can forgive, I just can't forget
You say control my temper, but when I feel like shit, I feel like shit

Cause I was born to be (ST)
And I'll always be (ST)
Don't get down on me (ST)
Cause I'm down OG (ST)

Why can't I ask any questions if what you say is true?
Am I supposed to believe everything, or just everything said by you?
And how can you call me stupid when you don't understand what I say?
And how can you call me evil?
Have you spoken to God today? And what did He say?

Cause I was born to be (ST)
And I'll always be (ST)
Don't get down on me (ST)
Cause I'm down OG (ST)
Not afraid to die (ST)
Just you promise me (ST)
You gotta carry on (ST)
You gotta carry on (ST)
As long as your heart beats
Pledge your allegiance

You can call me ugly, but I'll still dress the way I choose
How you gonna judge me? You've never taken a walk in my shoes
Why don't you ever trust me when I'm smiling? Is it a sin to have fun?
And why should I repent when there's nothin' wrong with anything that I've done?

Cause I was born to be (ST)
And I'll always be (ST)
Don't get down on me (ST)
Cause I'm down OG (ST)
But if I die (ST)
You gotta promise me (ST)
You gotta carry on (ST)
You gotta carry on (ST)
Pledge your allegiance
Pledge your allegiance
Pledge your allegiance
Pledge your allegiance
Pledge your allegiance
Pledge your allegiance
Pledge your allegiance
Pledge your allegiance
