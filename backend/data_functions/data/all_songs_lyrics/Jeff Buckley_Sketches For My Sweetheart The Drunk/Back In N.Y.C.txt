Back In N.Y.C LyricsI see faces and traces of home back in new york city
So you think i'm a tough kid is that what you heard?
Well, i like to see some action, and it gets into my blood
Well, they let me out of pontiac when i was just seventeen
I had to get it out of me if you know what i mean, what i mean
They say i must be crazy, cause i don't care who i hit, who i hit
Cause i know it's me that's hitting out and i'm not full of shit
Down by my bottle, filled up high with gasoline
You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been
As I cuddled the porcupine he said i had none to blame but me
Held my heart, deep in hell, time to shave, shave it off, it off
No time for romantic escape and your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No, no time for romantic escape and your fluffy heart is ready for rape
Off we go
Off we go
Off we go
You're sitting in your comfort, you don't believe i'm real
You cannot buy protection for the way that i feel
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash
It was mine in the first place so i'll burn it to ash
When i've taken all the strongest meats
And laid them down in coloured sheets
Laid them down in colored sheets
Well, who needs illusions
Of love and affection when you're out walking in the streets
Your mainline connection
Connection
As i cuddled the porcupine he said i had none to blame but me
Held my heart deep in hell time to shave, shave it off, it off
No time for romantic escape and your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No. no time for romantic escape and your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No. no time for romantic escape and your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No time
