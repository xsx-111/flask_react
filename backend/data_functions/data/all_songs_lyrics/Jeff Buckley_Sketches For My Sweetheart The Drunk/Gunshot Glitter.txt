Gunshot Glitter Lyrics(J.Buckley)
Don't you wanna let go of your heart
Or youâ€™ll resist the beds of bliss
Fortune makes fools of us all
My dear materialista, silence was insane
The parting was mutual
Don't you want the rocket to rock out?
There's room for us both to fly
Tell the man I'm never coming back again
Tell the man I'm never coming back again
Why should you notice at all?
Gone again beside you will fall
Down to the sea out of the skies
Of gold cards and casualties
I have only come to see you shine
Feminine smiles the right side is wise, more than I
I wanna be your lover
Lipstick my name across your mirror
Blood red with faked gunshot glitter
And be one with all you disown in your young life
You paranoia politician diva
You paranoia politician diva
Will you let go of your heart
Left behind a hypnotizing swirl
The semi's left behind
Don't you want to rocket to rock?
There's room for both us to fly
Same show everyday, don't have to blow up in the sky
So I just came from hick town
Left my coins behind
Maybe some poor clone's gonna buy himself a line
Why should you care if I crash your affair?
Why should you notice me? I really wanna see you shine
I wanna be your lover
Lipstick my name across your mirror
Now, be one with all you disown
True love has come to us all
Blinded by the flame, right side smiles
Organized mail, love, my silence was insane
The parting was mutual the moment I became
A paranoia politician diva
A paranoia politician diva
A paranoia politician diva
A paranoia politician diva
Diva, diva, divaEmbed
