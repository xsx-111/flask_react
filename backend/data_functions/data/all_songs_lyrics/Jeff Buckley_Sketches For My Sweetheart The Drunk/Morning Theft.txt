Morning Theft Lyrics
Time takes care of the wound
So I can believe
You had so much to give
You thought I couldn't see
Gifts for boot heels to crush
Promises deceived
I had to send it away
To bring us back again

Your eyes and body brighten
Silent waters, deep
Your precious daughter in the
Other room, asleep
A kiss "goodnight" from every
Stranger that I meet
I had to send it away
To bring us back again

Morning theft
Unpretender left
Ungrateful

True self is what
Brought you here, to me
A place where we can
Accept this love
Friendship battered down by
Useless history
Unexamined failure
What am I still to you?
Some thief who stole from you?
Or some fool drama queen
Whose chances were few?
Love brings us to who we need
A place where we can save
A heart that beats as
Both siphon and reservoir
You're a woman, I'm a calf
You're a window, I'm a knife
We come together
Making chance in the starlight

Meet me tomorrow night
Or any day you want
I have no right to wonder
Just how, or when
You know the meaning fits
There's no relief in this
I miss my beautiful friend
I had to send it away
To bring her back againEmbed
