Opened Once LyricsI once was open at one with a travelling heart
I loved this sweet guide
Just like affection rushing in your riverbed
Arise like applause in my head
And in the half-light where we both stand
This is the half-light, you see me as I am
Just like the ocean, always in love with the moon
It's overflowing now, inside you
We fly right over the minds of so many in pain
We are the smile of light that brings the rain
In the half light where we both stand
In the half light you saw me as I am
I am a rail road track abandoned
With the sunset forgetting I ever happened
That I ever happenedEmbed
