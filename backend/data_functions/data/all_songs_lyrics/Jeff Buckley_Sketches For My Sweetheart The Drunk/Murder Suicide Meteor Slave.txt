Murder Suicide Meteor Slave LyricsWould you like to meet the villain somewhere
Underneath the skull of a moon
Fire burned his eyes out
Cause his chains are too long for you
Someone has to pay for the damage done. no-one's gonna love you now
Your whole family's splintered, you're a slave to it all now
Ooooo ahhhhh
Oh, you're a slave to it all now
You're a slave
Welcome down to paradise rock. there is no single entrance
With the stars to revolve around
There is no real underground
No stars to revolved around
Here, they're fashioning the noose
Sickened by the knell of the graveyard bell
You know it's not long for you
Sick of all the vomit childhood
Not a trampoline of the freaks
Not even a slave to your father
Oh, you're a slave to it all, now
Oh, you're a slave to it all, now
Welcome down to paradise rock
There is no single entrance
With the stars to revolve around
There is no real underground
There is not a single entrance
There's no stars to revolve around
There is no real underground
You're a slave to it all, now
Happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happyEmbed
