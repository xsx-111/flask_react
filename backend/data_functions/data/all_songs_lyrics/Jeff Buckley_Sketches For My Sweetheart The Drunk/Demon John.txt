Demon John LyricsSay farewell, g'night, Sonny-Jim
In your defenseless, winning smile
What do you hope to win?
And bliss face down, defended
Well, now stoned Demon John
There's no town the boy cannot belong
Why did you come here?
Is it to excavate all your sins? Boil within?
Slaughter like the daughter of the devil you send me
I have to deal, you called me here
You couldn't say that you were juiced
The night that you were introduced
To Demon John
Gonna take him with you when you go?
Dance down slow. Oh, way down
You cannot escape the bar-side angel dissector
You undo you life with too much cocoon
Who's your protector?
Dark is the city where the white girls walk by
Down below your eyes, just like fireflies
You call me here, come on here, follow me dear
Past cascades of rage and fear
You called me here
You couldn't say that you had been juiced
The time that you were introduced to Demon John
Well, you knew you had to want to go , dance down slow
By the light of the sun, murder comes
Today or tonight
Better get yourself and transcend it
Or burst of light
Blaze stars into me
While the love breaks through here and now
So, murder by the light of the sun
Please don't get too close to me
You said you are for real, it's not pretend
All memories stolen, know this for yourself
How would you like to be the happiest man in the world?
Behind the weathered field hands, whose blistered
Paws
Harvest cut, for wedding clothes they'll never wear
Marching down a road that was never there
It takes place on a sunlit face and the backbone broken
Please bring us light, Demon John, You Demon John
Take him with you when you go2Embed
