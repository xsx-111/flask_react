I Know We Could Be So Happy Baby (If We Wanted to Be) LyricsThere's no easy answer
None to blame or forgive
Two cripples dancing to the end we live
I'm not with you, but of you
Not with you, but of you
You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who come and go
And I hope I'll catch you in the throes
One last look at the wonder
One last look at the wonder
Oh, God, I love you
And all the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else we come to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who comes and goes
I'm hoping that I'll catch you in the throes
One last look at the joy that we've become
But there's no easy answer
None to blame or forgive
We were two cripples dancing
To the bitter end we live
I'm not with you, but of you
I'm not with you, but of you
Oh, God, I loved you
And all of the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else it comes to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
We had a birthplace in common
We have separate beds and lives
Just sit here and gloat
Break out the oldest pictures
And hang your ruined letters out to dry
We had a birthplace in common
And separate beds and lives
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
Yeah, ohEmbed
