Thousand Fold LyricsI have no desire to make contact with all the thought of "no, no."
I shiver now, to think of how this answer asked her, no
Long time gone
I run to my hide out
There ain't a star born that brightens
More than you, you always should have known
I'll illuminate your question
Long time ago I'd died and gone
What has brought the question?
Time has brought the question
Come and call the question, Oh, oh, oh
Here are the stars, same thing again
Over, over, over, over, over, over
Over, over, over, over, over, over1Embed
