Yard Of Blonde Girls LyricsThrough the yard, through the yard of blonde girls
Through the river and the sea
Gold sharks glittering
A tree of white breaks the earth
The streets where Lola played
Very sexy, very sexy
Okay, okay
Fear, we may come. (X 4)
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run
It's in your heart, it's in your art, your beauty
Even in this world of lies, there's purity
You've got innocence in your eyes
Even in this world of lies, you're still hopeful
Very sexy, very sexy
Okay, okay
Fear, we may come. (X 4)
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Through the yard, through the yard of blonde girls
Through the river and the sea
Gold sharks glittering
A tree of white breaks the earth
The streets where Lola played
Very sexy, very sexy
Okay, okay
Fear, we may come. (X 4)
So run, run, run, run, run, run, runEmbed
