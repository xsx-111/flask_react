The Sky Is a Landfill LyricsCircle around the park, joining hands in silence
Watch the evil black the sky
The storm has ripped the shelter of illusion from our brow
This power is no mystery to us now
Leave your spirit genocide, the cancer you won't remove
We cast our funeral rose inside and bury the need to prove
Our mutilation is to gain from the system
Turn your head away from the screen, oh people
It will tell you nothing more
Don't suck the milk of flaccid Bill K. Public's empty promise
To the people that the public can ignore
This way of life is so devised to snuff out the mind that moves
Moving with grace the men despise, and women have learned to lose
Throw off your shame or be a slave of the system
I see you take another drag
One more lost soul to raise your flag
The sky is a landfill
I see you take another drag
Let's see you take another drag
You like to dance to the rolling head of the adulteress
You sing in praise of suicide
We know you're useless
Like cops at the scene of crime
With your steroids and your feedbag and your stable and your trainer
I got a mail bomb for you, Mr. Strong Arm
Throw out the stones from all the cemetery homes
For the violence of a nation gone by
Or the politics of weakness and the garbage dump of souls
That will now black the sky
Their yellow haze and crowds of eyes will plug up the mind that moves
Moving with grace the men despise, and women have learned to lose
We'll share our bodies in disdain for the system
I see you take another drag
One nation bends to kiss the hag
The sky is a landfill
I see you take another drag
I see you take another drag
I have no fear of this machine3Embed
