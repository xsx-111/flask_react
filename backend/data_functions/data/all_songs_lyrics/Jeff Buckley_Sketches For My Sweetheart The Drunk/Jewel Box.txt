Jewel Box LyricsI know you're a woman by the way you burn below
I'll tell you secrets so good, you'll never tell a soul
Come closer, that bonfire holds his life like stones
My years, my life unknown
Diamonds from the pavement where the broken glass had been
Just like these troubles that i'm leaving to the wind
Like sapphires in boxcars speeding towards the end
Like thieves, my bad luck grows
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Crystallise illusion shine, forgot i'm here
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Oh, you left some stars in my belly
Star crossed child's love on the bands of wedding gold
Silver studs of promise hide in the red crushed velvet folds
Inaction, intention, like emeralds i stole
My speech of custom gold. i think i ought to know
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tears
Crystallise illusion shine, forgot i'm here
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Oh, you left some stars in my belly
You left some stars in my belly
You left some stars in my bellyEmbed
