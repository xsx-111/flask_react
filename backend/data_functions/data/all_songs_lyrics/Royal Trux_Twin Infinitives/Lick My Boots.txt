Lick My Boots Lyrics
Neighbor called laughing
Fancies himself like you and me
All the girls treated him well
Never really kept no much
They were jealous so much of the American queen
They only score bout who they’ve seen
Talk with men, a hundred a month
Was beaten in the woods sweeter than blood

Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
Tell me a story
Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
Uh-uh, honey, she was gone that one the story was boring

I wanna tell it anyway
She wants to tell it anyway
Haha, ha-hee, hee-hee
It's so funny it’ll make you pee
It's about my lover and the sweet ice cream
It's about a lover in the street asking
Neighbors called laughing
Fancies himself like you and me
All the girls treat him well
Never really left no much
They were jealous so much of an American queen
They open the skirt but who do they see
Talk with men, a hundred a month
Was beaten in the woods sweeter than mud

Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
Tell me a story
Nuh-uh, baby, she was gone that one, the story’s boring

I wanna tell it anyway
She wants to tell it anyway
Ah-ha, haha, hee-hee-hee
It's so funny it'll make you pee
It's about my lover and sweet ice cream
It's about my lover and sweet ice cream
Hah hah hah ah-hee hee hee
It’s so funny it’ll make you pee
Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
Tell me a story
Nuh-uh, honey, she was gone, this story is boringEmbed
