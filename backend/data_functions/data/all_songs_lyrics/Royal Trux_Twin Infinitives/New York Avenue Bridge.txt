New York Avenue Bridge LyricsHi hibiscus
Eight-year bloom
Yesterday my jeans looked unreal
I walked alone, along 
But just inside
Hibiscus rustles, lips I could pop
I never met anyone I couldn't drop
Hibiscus, high bird
I hate your streets
Feel the air is clean
But my thoughts are unreal
I never known
I known where I've been
Until you Embed
