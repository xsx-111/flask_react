Ice Cream Lyrics
You give me ice cream, I give you dreams
I slip you a pistol, inject you with sweet cream
You give me ice cream, I give you dreams
I slip you a pistol, inject you with sweet cream
Ice cream
You give me ice cream, I give you dreams
I slip you a pistol, inject you with sweet cream
Ice cream
You give me ice cream, I give you dreams
I slip you a pistol, inject you with sweet cream
Ice cream

I got a vision so sweet and so true
And baby, if you're asking, I'll show it to you
Ice cream
I got a vision so sweet and so true
Baby, if you're asking, I'll show it to you
Ice cream
You give me ice cream, I give you dreams
I slip you a pistol, inject you with sweet cream
Ice cream
Ice cream
Ice cream
You give me ice cream, I give you dreams
I slip you a pistol, inject you with sweet cream
Ice cream
You give me ice cream, I give you dreams
I slip you a pistol, inject you with sweet cream
Ice cream

You're my baby, I know you'll scream
Ice cream (Ice cream)
Ice cream (Ice cream)
I got a vision so sweet and so true
Baby, if you're asking, I'll show it to you
Ice cream (Ice cream)
(Ice cream)
You know it's true (Ice cream)
I know you'll scream (Ice cream)
I know you'll scream
You give me ice cream, I show you my dream (Ice cream)
You know it's true
I know you'll scream
Ice cream
Ice cream
Ice cream
I got a vision so sweet and so trueEmbed
