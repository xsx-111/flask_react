Chances Are The Comets In Our Future Lyrics
Chances are doors that just open up
I don't just carry for nothing
Ten tons of rain in a plastic cup
Tears unknown that fill oceans
Chances are the comets in our future
While others go on living in the past
The future seems farther away than Jupiter
Does appear through the telescopic glass

You can move so many, many times
Our home is everywhere we've been
Some people like to show humility
Others live in dramatic scenes on ships
Instead of feeling their own dealing and partake
They grow invisible as their soul starts to slip
Away from the center of illumination
That old steel-toothed border upstairs

Bop, bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop
