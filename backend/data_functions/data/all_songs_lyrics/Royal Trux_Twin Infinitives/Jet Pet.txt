Jet Pet Lyrics
Come on, man, she knows the word
Stumblin' 'round your houses, you heard
She did it down in L.A. for money
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey

Do a little twist, a little shake
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey
Brown and gold Mexican man
Always got a hole
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey

Do a little twist, a little shake
Yeah, Queenie in L.A
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey
Queenie gonna save me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey

Pants full of money now Queenie gonna get high
Yeah, yeah, hey, heyEmbed
