The Ghost Lyrics
Hold on until the ghost appears
That day is gonna last for years
Strange wind is gonna blow through town
Lightning is gonna strike us down
Blue hills are looking good to me
I go there when I'm fast asleep
Ghost town and the desert wind
Strange sounds at the worlds end

And then the winds start to blow
And the fire comes scorchin' down (Oh yeah)
And then the sky disappears
In the cloud with an awful sound (yeah)
And when you can't hold out
Then you run to the underground

Just a blue star hangin' out in space
Earth town is a lovely place
Strange winds comin' from the sky
Lovers gotta say goodbye

And then the winds start to blow
And the fire comes scorchin' down (Oh yeah)
And then the sky disappears
In the cloud with an awful sound (yeah)
And when you can't hold out
Then you run to the underground
Look out before the ghost appears
Look out before the ghost appears
Strange winds
No skyEmbed
