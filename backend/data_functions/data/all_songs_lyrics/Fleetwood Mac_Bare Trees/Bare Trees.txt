Bare Trees Lyrics
Bare trees, grey light
Oh, yeah, it was a cold night
Bare trees, grey light

I was alone in the cold of a winter's day
You were alone and so snug in your bed
I was alone in the cold of a winter's day
You were alone and so snug in your bed

Bare trees, grey light
Oh, yeah, it was a cold night
Bare trees, grey light

I was alone in the cold of a winter's day
You were alone and so snug in your bed
I was alone in the cold of a winter's day
You were alone and so snug in your bedEmbed
