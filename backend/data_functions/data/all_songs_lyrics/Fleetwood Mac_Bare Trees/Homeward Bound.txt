Homeward Bound Lyrics
I wanna sit at home in my rocking chair
I don't wanna travel the world
As far as I'm concerned I've had my share
But time's more precious than gold
I don't wanna see another aeroplane seat
Or another hotel room
The home life to me seems really neat
I just wanna unpack for good

Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound
Buy me a ticket homeward bound
Oh, homeward bound

Well, it all seems the same when you've done it before
There's no difference in the style
There's no end in sight or my own front door
I'll be a stay-at-home for awhile
So I'll have another drink and a cigarette
Just to console myself somehow
It's not too bad if you can forget
I've just gotta find a way somehow

Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound
Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound
Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward boundEmbed
