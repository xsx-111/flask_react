Thoughts on a Grey Day Lyrics
I thank my God for perfect love and peace
I'll hold her tight and always as
And, and always
Mine forever, love, love
So great, so divine
Trees, the grey day has changed everything
It's beautiful, just beautiful
So beautiful, this first grey day is ours
My loving child
By grace of God we live, my child, and love
I crawl to my knees, my dear love
Will you promise to kiss my perfect healing hands and fingers?
And make a promise to me you will always obey
My each command and never, ever fail me
You'll be mine forever more
The sun is here, my love, my love
My sun, our sun complete
God bless our perfect, perfect grey day
With trees so bare, so bare
But oh so beautiful, so beautiful
The grey, blue sky, the world is here
Ours, just, , just ours
Our own, hold us tight
I am yours, just a dream
And go on dreaming
May this joy of ours never ever cease
My love, my love
Pregnant sweet, love is tenderEmbed
