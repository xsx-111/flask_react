Eyes Are Mosaics Lyrics
Big swirls of people, we own Feltham
The city dada
The city dada
We burn through Chelsea
I’ll be penciled in and eager
The city dada
The city dada
We run from Marylebone
Big swirls of people, we own Feltham
The city dada
The city dada
We burn through Chelsea

Got no time
(Don’t think of everyone you know)
(Visit small-time central Poli)
When will this thing go faster?
(If you’re sick of whom you know inside)
(Visit small-time central Poli)
Gone to
(If you’re sick of whom you know inside)
(Visit small-time central Poli)
Bad-apple raise-your-hands-up town
Why won’t you accept a yes?
(This is like everything else, you know)
(Visit small-time central Poli)
Big swirls of people, we own Feltham
The city dada
The city dada
We burn through Chelsea

Diamond crazy
(How cheeky cheeky cheap, oh León)
Diamond crazy
(How cheeky cheeky cheap, oh León)
Diamond crazy
(How cheeky cheeky cheap, oh León)
Diamond crazy
(How cheeky, give me cheap, oh León)

Diamonds
(If you think that thinking else gets done)
(Visit small-time central Poli)
Can’t wait to go fast now
(If you’re sick of whom you know inside)
(Visit small-time central Poli)
Night there
(This is like everything else, you know)
(Visit small-time central Poli)
Gone out though, into town
Quite lost, future India
(If you think that thinking else gets done)
(Visit small-time central Poli)
I’ll be penciled in and eager
The city dada
The city dada
We run through Marylebone
Big swirls of people, we own Feltham
The city dada
The city dada
We burn through Chelsea

Cheap and fast
We all assess
How we long for lies
And we go through divine
