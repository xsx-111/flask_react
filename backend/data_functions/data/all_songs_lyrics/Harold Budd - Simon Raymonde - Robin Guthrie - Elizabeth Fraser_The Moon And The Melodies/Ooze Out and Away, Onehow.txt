Ooze Out and Away, Onehow Lyrics(A tame soul)
(Until tomorrow)
(I hope so)
(I hope so)
(Talk to me)
(Sing to me)
(Is it)
(Meant to be now)
(I know it’s so soon)
(This man in the moon star)
(Plays me)
(Nah nah nah nah nah)
(Caress me now)
(This man says, I sighed)
(Answer me)
(Answer me slow)
(Closer to me)
(Don’t talk)
(Is this no more)
(I meant to be)
(Hope)
(For your)
(Sickness)
(Yes)
Ridiculous, you little boy
I think you know this, man
So strong was she
You seem doomed to lose my heart
Don’t need no lover (so handsome)
Anything she can get (awesome)
Lazy, lazy little boy (lazy lazy little boy)
I think you know this, man (I see now)
So strong was she (she’s so strong)
You seem doomed to lose my heart (I’ve seen her, she’s so awesome)
Don’t need no lover (so handsome)
Anything Sheena sees, men can get (awesome)Embed
