She Will Destroy You LyricsJust to find new animals
Who don’t keep close to come by me
Just to find new animals who love the sound of sona mi a voz
Mi senza
In she sends us
To dare to find new animals who love the sound of sona mi a voz
Mi senza
In she sends us
Just to find new animals who love the sound of sona mi a voz
Mi senza
Martin cooked a small green cup of hurt
For me
I know
Evening time you’ll have a cup from her
He hopes
He knows
He had to elope the problems of his birth
The afternoon for poker pool
Snappy work te bušta veux
"Denada no" to poker pool
Deska donu, te bušta veux Deneuve
Mi senza
The afternoon for poker pool
Snappy move te bušta veux
"Denada no" to poker pool
Deska donu, te bušta veux Deneuve
Mi senza
Time to go, you’ll hurt this dream of love
Es i senza
Martin, don’t you know your troubles hurt?
And she stands upEmbed
