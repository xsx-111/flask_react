Sea, Swallow Me LyricsInterrupted, Lily punts in jest
Heading through the air and then there’s more
Yet I want to know
Yet I want to know
Yet I want to know
Yet I want to know
Molly’s never spoken of faith, oh no
(And nobody better try, oh my)
But we gotta know
But we gotta know
For the dough, mix our long arms
Stump and rum punch
The richest scene I’ve ever quite seen
The saddest sights I’ve seen in you below
Interrupt her, Lily punts in jest
Heading through the air and then there’s more
Yet I want to know
Yet I want to know
That I won’t need my leg, arm, or feet
Mum, I love money now
Into dark sleep (they all seem so weak)
Conscious, I find (yes they seem so weak)
(They—must—not—be—fast)
Yet I want to know (but they seem so weak)
Yet I want to know  (yes they seem so)
Yet I want to know  (ver–y, ver–y)
Yet I want to know  (thin)
Into dark sleep (they all seem so weak)
Conscious, I go  (how can they all be)
(With you and they cannot—be—fast)
Yet I want to know (but they seem so weak)
Yet I want to know (yes they seem so)
That I won’t need my leg, arm, or feet (ver–y, ver–y)
Mum, I love money now (thin)
(But they seem so weak)
The richest scene I’ve ever quite seen
(Yes they seem to me)
The saddest sights I’ve seen in you before
(And they move a little line)
(It’s true they cannot—be—fast)
The richest scene I’ve ever quite seen
The saddest sights I’ve seen with you
We played the part that I’ve seen before
