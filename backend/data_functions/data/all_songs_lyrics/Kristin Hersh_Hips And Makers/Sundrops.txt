Sundrops LyricsYou can't get any more sunshine
I can't get over how it rains down
Oh no no no
You can't get any more sunshine
You can't get any more broken down
Oh no no no
Is the car parked downtown
Leave it while the sun beats down
We can walk and walk and walk
Walk and walk and walk
You can't get any more sunshine
Barefoot while the heat rains down
Oh no no no
There's nothing I forgot
I left that paper heart where it belonged
Who it belonged to
I never knew I never never knew
Paper burns and my heart melts
When I tear at you
Sun drops down down now now now nowEmbed
