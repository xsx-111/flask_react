Cuckoo LyricsOh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She wobbles when she flies
She don't ever holler cuckoo
Till the fourth day of July
Jack of diamonds
Jack of diamonds
I know you of old
You rob my poor pockets of silver and gold
Oh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
I wish that she was mine
She don't ever drink water
She only drinks wine
Gonna build me a log cabin
On a mountain so high
So I can see willy
When he goes on by
Oh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She wobbles when she flies
She don't ever holler cuckoo
Till the fourth day of JulyEmbed
