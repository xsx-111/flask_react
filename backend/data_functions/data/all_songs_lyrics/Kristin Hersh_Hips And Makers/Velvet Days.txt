Velvet Days LyricsVelvet days, you make your little way
Pouring rain, make that face
You make my little day
I laugh 'til my heart drops
Down deep
You break your little freak
We break, don't we break, don't we?
Blush and knock your knees
That's your girl breathing
I laugh till my heart stops
Hold your shark skin thing
That's your boy breathing
I laugh till my heart stops
Blush and breathe
I laugh till I can't see
Down deep you break your little creep
Listen blush and breathe
That's your soul kissing
I laughEmbed
