Houdini Blues LyricsOh no, don't you put me in that box
You know what you can do with those locks
Bet your life I'll come crawling out again
You'll have to deal with me then
You'll hear me in the wind
I've been on the other side of the Blue Ridge
Seen the Shenandoah rolling there
I stepped off the mountains edge
Just to climb the golden stair
I seen the streets up there
I been on the mount transfiguration
Been there with my Ma and my Pa
On the mountain of commandment
I been handed down the law
You should have seen what I saw
I fell to the bottom of Thales' well
Caught like a thief with a lamb
You know these stars they can cast a spell
I've been caught with red hands
I've been caught with red hands
I scaled the mountains, skiied the valleys
I've done the highs and the lows
I don't feel like work today
Hell I won't go
Bess I won't go
Just let me at their locks
We should all be free
Oh Bess, i swear I'll call
When I'm free from me
We should all be freeEmbed
