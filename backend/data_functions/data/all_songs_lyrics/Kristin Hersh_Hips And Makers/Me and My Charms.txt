Me and My Charms LyricsMe and my charms
You can come back
When you want
Just know that I'll be here
I haven't left this step
And when the lights go out
I pick the angel up
I only have two hands
Is she here?
Is she here right now?
Drive her off; don't bother to call
I'm checking out today
Me and my charms
Me and my charms
When I kiss the angel
I have a taste of you
When I take the angel
I have a piece of you
I have a piece
You can come back
I haven't left you yet
And when the lights go out
I pick the angel up
I only have two left feet
All I have in my hands
All I have in my hands
Me and my charms
Me and my charms
When I kiss the angel
I have a taste of me and my charms
Me and my charms down on the ground
You can't leave me now
You can't leave me now
I haven't left you yet
All I have in my hands
Me and my charms
Me and my charms
When I kiss the angel
I have a taste of you
When I take the angel
I have a piece of you
I have a pieceEmbed
