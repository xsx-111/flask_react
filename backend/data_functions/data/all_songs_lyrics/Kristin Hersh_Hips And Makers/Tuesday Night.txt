Tuesday Night LyricsWhen you sleep you tell me off
I told you once before
I can't resist you
When I sleep I build you up
I make you king of here
I can't resist you
I can't wait...
I'll suck down another water
While I wait
I watch the clock turn blue
And think of you while I wait
I can't wait
The moon shines through my dress
And through my glass
I promise not to drink
Until you're home
I can't wait..
The moon pales even when
It thinks it holds the face
Of the clock I watch for you
While I wait
I can't wait...Embed
