Teeth LyricsI could get a piece of meat
From a barren tree
Nothing ever spoiled on me
You brought this
You dipshit
Nothing ever spoiled on me
That cloud stomps around my house
Does whatever it pleases
It teases me
What the hell?
Never was a baritone
Till you stepped in
Never dried my halters
On the line
This hairdo's truly evil
I'm not sure it's mine
You're so tall
It's like I climb a waterfall
That cloud stomps around my house
Does whatever it pleases
It teases me
What I said was get me a drink
Alright?
What am I supposed to sit
And look at you all night?
All girls cry
Like I said
I don't kow why
That cloud stomps around my house
Does whatever it pleases
It teases me
What the hell?
Never was a baritone
Till you stepped in
Never dried my halters
On the line
This hairdo's truly evil
I'm not sure it's mine
You're so tall
It's like I climb a waterfallEmbed
