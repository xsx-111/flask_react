The Letter LyricsSeptember 29th, 1984
Dear so and so
Gather me up because I'm lost
Or I'm back where I started from
I'm crawling on the floor
Rolling on the ground
I might cry, I won't go home
So here's the story
I am turning up in circles
And I'm spinning on my knuckles
Don't forget that there are circles left undone
Very close to me
Forgive me. Comfort me
I'm crawling on the floor
Rolling on the ground
There's a blanket wrapped around my head
I'm moving in a line, it's shaped like this
I'm
I'm holding in my breath, I have a room
Can you tell if I am lying?
Don't forget that I'm living inside
The space where walls and floor meet
A box inside my chest
An animal stuffed with my frustration
Can you hear me?
Don't forget that I'm alone when you're away
You make me act like other people do
Forgive me
Comfort me
You comfort me
You make me die
I'm gonna cry
I won't go home
Don't kill the God of Sadness
Just don't let her get you down
See, the man inside a book I read
Can't handle his own head
So what the hell am I supposed to do?
I'd like to know how he died
My hands are shaking
Don't you love me anymore?
I only need a person, keep my shoulders
Stand around, lie down
Move your hand above the floor
Gather me up because I'm lost
Or I'm back where I started from
I'm crawling on the floor
Rolling on the ground
I'm gonna cry
You look for me
Love, Kristin
P.S. Keep them comingEmbed
