Hips and Makers LyricsRocking on the ocean
Sucking up the sea
Every bird flies over me
We have hips and makers
We have a good time
I married a boxer to keep me from fighting
I married a brewer to keep me from drinking
We have a good time
They keep me dancing
Finally it's alright
It's alright
Finally it's alright
It's alrightEmbed
