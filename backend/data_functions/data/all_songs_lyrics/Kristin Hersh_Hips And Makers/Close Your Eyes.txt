Close Your Eyes LyricsYou can't make it
You can't cry
You can't make it home tonight
It's too far to walk
To your goddamn van
It's too hard to come by your hand
Drunk on nothing
Drunk all night
Mad at nothing
Close your eyes
You could run on iron lungs
It would not keep you clean
Run on iron lungs
It would not keep you sons of bitches clean
You think that they don't shatter you
You think that 'til they go
You think that they don't comfort you
Now go home
You can walk in moonlight
You can dance inside
You can dance in moonlight
Close your eyes
Stop, you ruined all my memories
You ruined all my memories
I wanna catch the falling babies
I'm falling into you
My hair's in your face
Eyes on your eyes
Hands on my back
I can't leave
I can't leave
A guy's asking questions about me
My hands are full of straw
I'm sliding really fast
My hands are full of snow
I don't understand
I don't understand puzzles
I can't breathe
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyesEmbed
