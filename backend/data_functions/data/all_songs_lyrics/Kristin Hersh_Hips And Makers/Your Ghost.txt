Your Ghost LyricsIf I walk down this hallway
Tonight it's too quiet
So I pad through the dark
And call you on the phone
Push your old numbers
And let your house ring
'Till I wake your ghost
Let him walk down your hallway
It's not this quiet
Slide down your receiver
Stand across the wire
Follow my number
Slide into my hand
It's the blaze across my nightgown
It's the phone's ring
Chorus:
I think last night
You were driving circles around me
You were driving circles around me
You were driving circles around me
I can't drink this coffee
Till I put you in my closet
Let him shoot me down
Let him call me off
I take it from his whisper
You're not that tough
It's the blaze across my nightgown
It's the phone's ring
Chorus:
You were in my dream (I think last night)
You were driving circles around me (x5)Embed
