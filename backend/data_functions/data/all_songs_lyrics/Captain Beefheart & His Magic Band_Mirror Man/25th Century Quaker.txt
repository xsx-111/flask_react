25th Century Quaker Lyrics
Mayflower child met a
25th Century Quaker
She's a-pickin' poppies
'n' bringin' them into her hue

Sun sifting through and through
And through
Letting them all and all
Fill through
Me into you, me to you
Me to you, into hue
Blue cheese faces
Laces, blue cheese faces
Faces 'n' phases
'n' phases 'n' faces

Going through the cottage cottage
Going through the cottage cottage
Going through the cottage cottage
Come with me baby, come with me
Come with me baby, come with me
Quaker child
Quaker paper child
Flutterinâ€™ ants flutter like fireflies
Eyes that flutter like a wide open shutter
Wide open shutter, wide open shutter
Shutter, shutter, shutter
Faces in phases in phases
Eyes that shutter like a wide open shutter
Eyes that flutter like a wide open shutter
Shutter, shutter, shutter
Shutter, shutter, shutter
Shutter, shutter
Oh, woo me baby, come with me
Cottage cottage cottage
Cottage cottage cottage
Going through, going to
Going through, going to
Woo me baby, woo me baby
Laces laces laces
Laces laces laces
Laces laces laces
Blue cheese faces
Laces laces laces
Faces in faces in faces
Phases, phases

Mayflower child met a
25th century quaker
She's a-pickin' poppies
Bringin them into her hue
Sun just, sun just, sun just, sun just
Sun just siftin' through and through
And thru
Going through the cottage
Going to the cottage
Cottage cottage cottage
Cottage cottage cottage
Come with me baby, come with me
Come with me, come with me
Come with me, come with me


Come with me baby, come with meEmbed
