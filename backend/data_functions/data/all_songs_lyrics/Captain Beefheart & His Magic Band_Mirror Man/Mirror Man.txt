Mirror Man Lyrics
Mirror man, mirror me
Mirror than, mirror me
Mirror man, mirror than
Mirror land, farther than
Farther than
Mirror day, mirror way
Mirror man, mirror way
Mirror man, mirror me
Mirror man, mirror me

Mirror than mirror man, mirror me

Mirror dawn, dawnin' on me
Crack o dawn, mirror dawn
Mirror man, mirror gone
Mirror fall down, mirror gone down

Mirror girl, mirror boy
Mirror frog, mirror man
Mirror worm, mirror worm
Mirror bird
Mirror germ
Germ, germ, germ, germ
Little girl, little girl
Little girl, little girl
Mirror man, mirror me
Mirror man, mirror me
Mirror man, mirror me
Mirror man, mirror me
Mirror than, further me
Mirror maze, mirror maze
Mirror day, mirror way
Mirror man, mirror me
Mirror dawn, dawnin' on me
Dawnin' on me
Dawnin' on me, dawnin' on me
Dawnin' on me
Dawnin', dawnin'
Dawnin', dawnin, nin, nin, nin, nin, nin
Sin, sin, sin, sin, sin, sin, sin

Lead me to your mirror now
Lead me to your mirror then
Lead me to your mirror now
Lead me to your mirror then
Mirror men, mirror men
Mirror men, mirror men

Mirror man, mirror man
Mirror man, near-a than
Near-a you, near-a me
Mirror you, you're a me
You're a you, you're a me
You're a me, you're a me
You're me, you're a me
You're you're me, you're me, you're you're me
You're you're me, you're me, you're me
We're all one, we're all one
We're all one, we're all one
