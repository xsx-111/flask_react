Kandy Korn Lyrics
Yellow and
Orange and

Well, they look so good
I want to eat 'em
And they taste so good
I get to need 'em
Can-can-can-can-can-can-can-can-can-can-can-can-candy
Candy

Candy corn
Yellow and orange and
Candy corn
Yellow and orange and
Candy

Be reborn
Be reformed
Grow the storm
Stay, stay warm
Be reborn
Be reformed
Grow the storm
Stay, stay warm
I ain’t blue no more
Wooo, it’s like heaven, I said, I said...Embed
