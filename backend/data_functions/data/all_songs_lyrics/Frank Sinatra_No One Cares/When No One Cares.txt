When No One Cares LyricsWhen no one cares, and the phone never rings
The nights are endless things, you're like a child that cries
And no one hears the crying, you're like a falling star that dies
And seems to go on dying, when no one cares
You just count so many years and they glisten
With each tear, you can't believe that a love like hers
Could come from someone new, when no one cares but youEmbed
