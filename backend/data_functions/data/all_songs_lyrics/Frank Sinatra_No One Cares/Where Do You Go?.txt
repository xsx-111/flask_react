Where Do You Go? LyricsWhere do you go when it starts to rain?
Where will you sleep when the night time comes?
What do you do when your heart's in pain?
Where will you run when the right time comes?
These are the things that I want to know
Where will you hide when the lights are low?
Where do you go when it starts to rain?
Where will you sleep when the night time comes?Embed
