Come On, Come Over Lyrics
Come on, come over
As fast as you can
You're afraid that you won't like it
But you don't understand
One thing, my brother
I can tell you true
The more time you spend feeling happy
The less time you'll be blue

Come on, come on over
Come on, come on over
Come on, come, come over
Oh, come on, come on, come on over

Come on, come over
Everyone's waiting on you, yeah
We're wondering when you'll get tired
Of wondering what to do
There is something here
That cannot be denied
Get on the floor and get on down
Don't knock it 'til you try
Come on, come on over
Come on, come on over
Why don't you come on, come, come over
Oh, come on, come on over

Come on, come over
The pleasure's all mine
Music's playin', the door just opened
You don't have to stand in line
People of the world
Have been uptight, ooh wee, far too long
While you're busy making stands
Everybody's making plans
To move on, ooh wee, all along

Come on, come over
Come on, come over
Why don't you come on, baby, come over
Oh, come on, come on over
Oh, come on, I'm waiting on you
Come on, come on over
Don't take long but come on, come over
Come on, come over
Oh, come onEmbed
