Wildfire Lyrics
Oh! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

As I been...
Somebody's been setting fire in my neighborhood
An old car has been...
Somebody... somebody tell me
Where's that 
And who's been setting a fire?
Wildfire!
It's wild f-f-fire!

The fire inspector came up into the street and he said to me, he said real quick, he said
"How do you know- how do you know, how do you know, how do you know, how do you know, how do you know, how do you know, how do you know, how do you know... how- how?"
Yeah, I asked him:
I said "how do you know?"
I said "how do you know, really? How do you know? How do you know?"

And I said to the fire chief, I said
"What bothers you about everything?" (Reality)
I said, "what bothers you about everything?"
I said, "what bothers you about everything?" (Reality)
A little bit louder, please (Reality!)
A little bit faster, please (Reality!)
A little faster (Reality, reality!)
A little louder (Reality! Reality!)
Yeah! La lalala!
So... get a-a-a a sight of reality!
Oh, I say you say rea-
Oh, somebody open up the lampshade
Somebody, somebody get up off their chair
Somebody tell me, what bothers you about reality?
Everything!
What bothers you about everything?
Reality, yeah! (Reality!)
(Reality!) Yeah!
(Reality!) Yeah, yeah, yayayaya yaya (Reality!)
Oh yeah! (Reality)
Oh yeah! (Reality!)
O-oh yeah (Reality!)
Chachachachacha (Reality)

Oh...
