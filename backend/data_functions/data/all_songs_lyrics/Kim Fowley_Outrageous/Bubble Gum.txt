Bubble Gum LyricsAaaw, easy...
Here it comes baby, are you ready for it?
Name is Bubblegum
Live for moon and sun
Young and so much fun
Life's just be- life has just begun
Your name is Bubblegum
Live for moon and sun
Young and so much fun
Life's just be- life has just begun
Hit it!
Aw, for the last time...
Here it comes...
Your name is Bubblegum
Live for moon and sun
Young and so much fun
Life's just be- life has just begun
Bubblegum, yeah!
Oh yeah!Embed
