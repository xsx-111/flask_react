Barefoot Country Boy Lyrics
I'm a barefoot country boy, jammin' everyday
So me and my music can run away
Down Oak Diamond, ready to sign
I hitchhiked to heaven, who knows what I'll find
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Rocky roads gypsters sniff a jewelry box gold
A beast of a bulldog, I'm big, bad, and bold
I dance so dandy, so light on my toes
My rhythm is h-hot, I sing through my nose
Ah... yeah! Ah...

I'm a barefoot country boy with a backwoods soul
A rip-roaring dragon, I'm in full control
A midnight cowboy, a dude who was mean
My boots are so black, black, my leather is clean
Oh yeah! Woah!

Rock 'n' roll, so...
Wow! Woah! Ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah-uh...
Uh..
Yeah...Embed
