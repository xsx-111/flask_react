Inner Space Discovery Lyrics

Take four: Insane version

Wait a minute, a question to ask

What?

Is- was the music together?

Yeah

Okay

Mark Lindsay voice, Kim

Late at night, I looked inside
The spaceman's face
He speaks to me:
Bayayoi datatata- in a strange tongue
Is our planet doomed?
Are we doomed?
Are you crazy? Turn up your radio!
Ah... I wan' ask you, everybody
The space is aside your own angel's face
Ah, ah, ahh, ow! Ah!
In the space, deep inside of the space
In the inner space
A heart inside this inner space
I looked for a sign of the angel's face
Deep inside the inner space
In search of a truth of the spaceman's face
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ah... Ow!
Uh ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ah, ah! Ahh!

In the year 1987, it happened
There will be an invasion of the planet Earth
The short-hair people of America are truly the aliens of our society
All long-hairs stand together
All brothers, everybody

All in space
Inner space
Inner space
Inner space
Inner space
Inner space
Inner space
Inner space
Inner space
Ah, whaa, woah!
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
This is a tactical alert!
This is a tactical alert!
All civilians and all women and children will please reach part to the main office of Imperial Records
The main office of Imperial Records has the answer to all of our problems

All of our problems are purely musical ones
All our problems are purely musical ones
If you want to know the answer to your problems
Tune-up your radio a little bit higher
A little bit higher, a little bit higher, a little bit higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, high-ah!
Ah...

Deep inside my inner space, I looked for the truth in the angel's face...Embed
