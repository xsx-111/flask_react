Ah
Hey hey hey hey, brother
I been watch- ay
Just the drums
I just wanna hear the drums
Drums dru-dru-dru drums dru-
Oy, the drums and the bass
Ah- dr- ahhh! shh! Ahhhh!

Oh, listen
There's somebody in this room
You know, maybe on the stage for argument it's now- ahhh!
H-h-h-h-h and I saw somebody sitting in the c-c-c-c-corner of the room!
I think that person is under the influence
Of a certain chemical substance
Ahh yeah yeah!
A certain c-c-c-chemical substance of
Known as... it's the same thing you find in oranges, brother

You know, I wanna see
I wanna hear some insanity right now from somebody in this audiеnce
I wanna hear somebody running
Oh god hеlp us all
Ahhh!
H-h-h-h-h-h-ohh.. oh you know
He dead- 
Trying to breathe in here!
Oh, look at that chick
Look at that chick over there
Somebody's running after her
Somebody's- somebody's running
Running ... fit!
What's the nastiest part of your hate?
How does your organ feel?
How does your organ feel?
Ahh, I wanna see you get organized
Let's see how much- let's see
Let's get a little bit faster
I wanna feel- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Faster!
Let's speed it up!
Let's speed it up now!
Oh, hold on now, hold it now
Ah, oh god

Ahh, there's somebody who brought a whip
Somebody brought in a whip
Who brought in those whips?
That great, big, fat redheaded chick
And your regular fox
You can't burn me with you cigarette butt
I know you want to burn me with your cigarette butt!
You wanna burn me?
You wanna whip me?
Well, whip me!
Well, whip me!
Well, whip me
Well, beat me!
Now! Now! Now! Now!
Now! Now! Now! Now!
Now! Now! Now! Now!
Now! Now! Now! Now!
Ah, w-ah! Ahh!
Ah... ah..
Ah, sh-
Ah, you brought your whips
You brought your cigarette butts-Embed
