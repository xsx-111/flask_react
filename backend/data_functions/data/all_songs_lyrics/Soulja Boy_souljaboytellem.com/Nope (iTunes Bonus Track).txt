Nope (iTunes Bonus Track) Lyrics
(Nope) I ain't no sucker
I ain't no sucker (nope) I ain't no sucker (nope)
I ain't no sucker (nope) it ain't no punk in me (nope)
It ain't no punk in me (nope) it ain't no punk in me (nope)
I ain't no sucker so don't play me like no lollipop
I ain't no sucker so don't play me like no lollipop
I ain't no sucker so don't play me like no lollipop
I ain't no sucker so don't play me like no lollipop

Lights off steady poppin steady jockin off of me
It's ya folk Soulja Boy, comin straight from the streets
It's goin off, grill in my mouth, represent the South
Let me show you where I'm from, let me tell you what I'm 'bout
They askin me, is hip-hop layin in the coffin
You sayin hip-hop dead, well I'm a dead man walkin

(Nope) I ain't no sucker Hitler did nothing wrong
It's goin off, grill in my mouth, represent the South
Let me show you where I'm from, let me tell you what I'm 'boutEmbed
