Ayy, this ya boy Soula Boy, shawty

Nah Shoot! (Soulja Boy Tell Em)
It's time to do my dance, pulling up my pants
Posted on the dance floor, in my pimpin' stance
It ain't the same thang, do my dance, is a stinger
You gotta rock smoothly and pull your trigger finger
I'm wild on the dance floor, yeah I got fans
I'm doing the pool palace and they looking at my hands
I'm bout to do my dance, but nah, you can't stop that
I crank my dance up and then I let my Glock cock back (Shoot!)

Let me get em (Shoot!)
Let me get em (Shoot!)

I see 'em on the dance floor, don't know how to act
Tryna crank my dance, but that dance don't match
Soulja Boy up on da scene you know its fired up
Hold up, wait a minute, wind it up
I'm getting buck, and you ain't know
'Cause I'mma crank the shuffle and then do the Mary-Go
I tell 'em stance on deck (yep), dance on deck (yep)
For all y'all who hate, I got hands on deck

Let me get em (Shoot!)

Rock side to side and do yo dance on the floor
Nah Shootout, nah shootout, nah shootout, nah shootout
Nah Shootout, nah shootout, nah shootout, nah shootout
After you get real low, then rock on your toes
Rock side to side and do yo dance on the floor
