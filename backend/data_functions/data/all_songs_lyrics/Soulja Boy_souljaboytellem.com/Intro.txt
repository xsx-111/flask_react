Intro Lyrics
Ay what we gonna do today Mr. Collipark?
Same thing we do everyday Soulja Boy. Try and crank the world

Ahh.. youuu (repeated)

From internet to mainstream
You already know what it is
Stacks on Deck Entertainment

The next big thang smokin' boy
It ain't no game this year
I want to thank all the fans for supportin' your boy
Helpin' me get the deal
Now we fittin' to take over the world
It ain't no game
I'm telling you what it is
Soulja Boy tell 'em
The movement
You better get with itEmbed
