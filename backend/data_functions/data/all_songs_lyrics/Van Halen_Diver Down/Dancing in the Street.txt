Dancing in the Street LyricsAh yeah!
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago (They'll be dancing)
Down in New Orleans (Dancing in the streets)
Up in New York City (Dancing in the streets)
All we need is music (sweet sweet)
Sweet music (sweet sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the streets, Oh!
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there, so come on
Grab a guy, grab a girl, everywhere around the world
There'll be dancing, dancing in the streets
(Oh) It's just an invitation, across the nation
A chance for the folks to meet
There'll be laughing and singing, music swinging
Dancing in the streets
Philadelphia, PA (Dancin' in the street)
Baltimore, in D.C. now (Dancin' in the streets)
Can't forget the Motor City (Dancin' in the streets)
All we need is music (sweet sweet)
Sweet music (sweet sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the streets, Oh!
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there, so come on
Grab a guy, grab a girl, everywhere around the world
Wow!
Hey hey hey!
Ow yeah, ow!
(Guitar Solo)
Dancin', they're dancin' in the street
(Dancin' in the streets)
Way down in L.A. everyday
(Dancin' in the streets)
Dancin' in the street
(Dancin' in the streets)
San Francisco Bay (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Dancin' in the streets)
They do it everyday now
(Dancin' in the streets)
Across the ocean blue (Ooh-ooh-ooh) me an' you
(Dancin' in the streets)
Dancin' in the street
(Dancin' in the streets)Embed
