The Full Bug LyricsI'll tell ya now
You corner my dog
It don't let you past
Got a bad lil' woman
Gon' bite yo' ass
Yeah, Won't let you past
Ah Yeah!
Wah!
Ah, precious sweetheart
Woman, all you want is good as it can get
Oh yeah!
An inspiration
Girl, you're sensational
And this gets better yet
Ah yeah!
(Ah) Well all your dreams of riches
Are based on magazines
(Ah) No this ain't television
But it's more than it seems
(Ah) 'Take those', 'need' and 'give all'
This much you understand
All I wanna give you woman (Oh)
Is the best part of a man, Yeah
Lemme show you
Babe to make the best of
What you haven't had,  ah yeah!
Just remember when you follow through
When the over isn't planned ah yeah!
(Ah) Looks just like an angel
But he's just talking trash
(Ah) He'll make conversation
But she's listening to your cash
(Ah) 'Take those', 'need' and 'give all'
This much you understand
All I wanna give you woman (Oh)
Is the best part of a man, Yeah
Oh, mmm, uh, mm, mm
Love that woman, heart and soul
In the grooves, on the go
You know
Ah Yeah!
Yeah you corner my dog
It don't let you past
Got a bad lil' woman
Gon' bite yo' ass
For sure
Ahhhhh
(Ah) Looks just like an angel
But he's just talking trash
(Ah) He'll make conversation
But she's listening to your cash
(Ah) 'take those', 'need' and 'give all'
This much you understand
All I wanna give you woman (Oh)
Is the best part of a man, Yeah
Best part of a man Embed
