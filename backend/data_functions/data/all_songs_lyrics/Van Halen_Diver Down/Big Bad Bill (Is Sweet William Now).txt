Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now) Lyrics
Well, way down yonder in Louisville
Lived a cat named Big Bad Bill
I wants ta tell ya
Ah, the cat was rough and tough, he would strut his stuff
Had the whole town scared to death
When he walked by, they all held their breath
He's a fightin' man, sure enough
And then Bill got himself a wife, now he leads a different life

Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now
Married life done changed him somehow
He's the man the town used to fear
Now they all call him Sweet Papa Willy Dear
Stronger than Samson I declare
Till a brown-skinned woman's bobbed his hair

Big Bad Bill don't fight anymore, no, no, no
He's doin' the dishes, moppin' up that floor, yes he is
Well, he used to go out drinkin' lookin' for a fight
Now he gotta see that sweet woman every night
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now
Ah, play it boys
Aw, yeah
Wooh
I likes that, yeah, yeah say I

Ah, well, Big Bad Bill don't fight anymore, no he don't
He's doin' the dishes, moppin' up that floor, yes he is
Well, he used to go out drinkin' lookin' for a fight
Now he gotta see that sweet woman every night
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now, doin' the dishes
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now, moppin' up that floor
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now
Cha, yeahEmbed
