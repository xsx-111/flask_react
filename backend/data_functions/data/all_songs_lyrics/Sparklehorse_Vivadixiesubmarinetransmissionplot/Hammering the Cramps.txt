Hammering the Cramps LyricsHey little dog, can you fly?
Hey little dog, can you fly?
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Hey little car, can you fly?
Hey little car, can you fly?
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Captain Howdy's here but
We can't see him
We can't see them
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Hammering the cramps
Oh yeahEmbed
