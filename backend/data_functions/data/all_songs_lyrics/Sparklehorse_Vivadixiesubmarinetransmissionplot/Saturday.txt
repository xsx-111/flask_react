Saturday Lyrics
You are a car
You are a hospital
I'd walk to hell and back
To see you smile
On Saturday

You are a star
You are a sea of air
I play great keyboards
Of horses' teeth
On Saturday
On Saturday

I'd like to tell you
How I feel
I'll probably keep it
Til Saturday
Oh Saturday, Saturday
Oh Saturday, Saturday
Oh Saturday, Saturday
Oh Saturday, Saturday
Oh Saturday, Saturday1Embed
