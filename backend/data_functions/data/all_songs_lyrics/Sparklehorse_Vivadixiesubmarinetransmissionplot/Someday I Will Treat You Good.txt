Someday I Will Treat You Good Lyrics
Something going on around here
I could not crawl back if I tried
I couldn't wait around
I couldn't wait another second
Something going on around here

I left my baby on the side of the highway
She just couldn't see things my way

Someday I will treat you good
Someday I will treat you fine
Someday I will treat you good
You know I should

Everything that's made is made to decay
Well I'm shrinking bones in the sun
Won't you tell me why that
The beautiful ones are always crazy
She's whispering like Morticia now

I left my baby on the side of the road
I left her with a heavy load
Someday I will treat you good
Someday I will treat you fine
Someday I will treat you good
You know I should

Something going on around here
I could not crawl back if I tried
I left my baby on the side of highway
She just couldn't see things my way

Someday I will treat you good
Someday I will treat you fine
Someday I will treat you good
You know I shouldEmbed
