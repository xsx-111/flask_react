Homecoming Queen Lyrics
A horse, a horse
My kingdom for a horse
Rattling on magnetic fields
Yes I did use up
The last box of sparklers
Before they went bad
Got wet or decayed

Homecoming queen, homecoming queen

Teeth what were sharp
Is ground down and dumb
My crooked spine becoming more brittle
What once grew straight
And tall t'ward the sun
Is absorbing back down
To dirt like a sponge

Homecoming queen, homecoming queen
Homecoming queen, homecoming queenEmbed
