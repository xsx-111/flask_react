Sad and Beautiful World Lyrics
Sometimes I get so sad
Sometimes you just make me mad

It's a sad and beautiful world
It's a sad and beautiful world

Sometimes I just won't go
Sometimes I can't say 'no'

It's a sad and beautiful world
It's a sad and beautiful world

Sometimes days go speeding past
Sometimes this one seems like the last

It's a sad and beautiful world
It's a sad and beautiful worldEmbed
