Rainmaker Lyrics
Well, shit, yeah!

All you've got to do is look in the sky and wish
You might see his face in the clouds or relaxing in a spirit ditch
He's been known to sleep on piles of dry leaves
Abandoned on October lawns
Sometimes he awakens with spiders on his eyelids

Rainmaker's coming
Rainmaker's coming
Rainmaker's coming to soak us with water

Sometimes you feel just like a stone tossed into the deep
All you gotta do is touch a woman's face that's warm with sleep
And he can show up at your, your back door in the deep
Trace him back before he was born
Inquiring about an honest days work for a decent meal

Rainmaker's coming
Rainmaker's coming
Rainmaker's coming to soak us with water
Sometimes he's hitching a ride in a freezer or appears as a mist
He's also been known to introduce himself as a scientist
He could be the retarded son of an old woman with
Seven fingers on each hand
'cos I know I reckon, he will come when he's beckoned for

Rainmaker's coming
Rainmaker's coming
Rainmaker's coming to soak us with water
To soak us with waterEmbed
