Most Beautiful Widow in Town Lyrics
We were both standing
In your mother's living room
Sweating up a storm in that
Terrible month of June
And the sweat rolled down your cheek
And into your mouth
I knew this must've been a dream
'Cause your mother would never let me in her house

You are the most beautiful widow
You are the most beautiful widow
You are the most beautiful widow in town

Many years later
The glassy month of December
I stood with my hands in my pockets
Trying to avoid
A shiny wedding portrait
Hanging on that old woman's wall
'Cause I knew you'd be wearing a smile
That'd be too painful to look upon

You are the most beautiful widow
I bet you are the most beautiful widow
I bet you are the most beautiful widow in townEmbed
