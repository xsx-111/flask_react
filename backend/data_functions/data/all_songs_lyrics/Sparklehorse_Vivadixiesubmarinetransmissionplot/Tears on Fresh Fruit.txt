Tears on Fresh Fruit Lyrics
Just when you've found your way to
The boiler room
They come and dig you out
With picks and shovels and
Acetylene torches

I couldn't do nothing but watch as her tears fell on fresh fruit
Behind the boney walls of my skull
There was playing a lullaby
La la la la la la la la la la la, la la la la la

Of our bodies
Our stomachs full of liquor
All our lungs
Full of water

I couldn't do nothing but watch as her tears fell on fresh fruit
Behind the boney walls of my skull
There was playing a lullaby
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la, laEmbed
