Under My Thumb LyricsUnder my thumb's the girl
Who once had me down;
Under my thumb's the girl
Who once fucked me around
It's down to me
The way she talks when she's spoken to; down to me
Change has come, she's under my thumb
Under my thumb's
A squirmin' dog who's just had her day;
Under my thumb's
A girl who has just changed her ways;
It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears; down to me
Change has come, she's under my thumb
Under my thumb's
A siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb's
The sweetest pet in the world
It's down to me
The way she does as wash your soul out of me;
Change has come, she's under my thumb
Under my thumb
Her eyes are just kept
To herself;
Under my thumb
Well, I
I can still look at someone else
It's down to me
The way she comes when I tell here to down to me;
Change has come, she's under my thumb
