Through These Eyes LyricsThrough these eyes
I've seen love and I've seen hate
I've seen the violence and the tears
Through these eyes
I got my schooling on the streets
I've seen the things in life you don't wanna see
Through these eyes
I've seen the shape of things to come
And I've watched them all fall apart
Through these eyes
I've seen the broken homes they cry
I've seen the poor man's face as he stands in line
And though my heart has made me weary
On a road less travelled on
Through the heart it hurts so dearly
And the pain it lingers on
Through these eyes
I've looked the devil in the face
And I've seen god's holy grace
Through these eyes
I've tried to walk the straighter line
I found myself again
I nearly lost my mind
And though my heart has made me weary
On a road less travelled on
Through the heart it hurts so dearly
And the pain it lingers on
And though my heart has made me weary
On a road less travelled on
Through the heart it hurts so dearly
And the pain it lingers onEmbed
