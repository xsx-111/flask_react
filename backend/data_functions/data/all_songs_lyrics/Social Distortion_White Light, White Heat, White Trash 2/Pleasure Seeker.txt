Pleasure Seeker LyricsWell here I come, I'm on a run
Who wants to fight temptation that's no fun
C'mon and play the games, don't you feel no shame
That's what Eve said to Adam before she came
You can smile now cry later on
You know that it might be wrong
But it feels so good
Like you know it would
There's damnation and disgrace
And guilt rears its ugly face
Yet you beg for more
Just a little more
Stand in line don't you lose your mind
Try like me to seek your pleasure three at a time
There's souls for sale, your're gonna burn in Hell
And if tomorrow never comes, its just as well
You can smile now, cry later on
You know that it must be wrong
But it feels so good
Like you know it would
There's damnation and disgrace
And guilt rears its ugly face
Yet you beg for more
Just a little more
Feel the pain! I feel it too
Have your hedonistic ways got the best of you?
Play the games, don't feel no shame
That's what Eve said to Adam before she came
You can smile now, cry later on
You know that it's definitely wrong
But it feels so good
Like you know it would
There's damnation and disgrace
And guilt rears its ugly face
Yet you beg for more
Just a little more1Embed
