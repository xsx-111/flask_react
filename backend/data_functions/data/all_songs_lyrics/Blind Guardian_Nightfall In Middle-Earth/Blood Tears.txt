Blood Tears LyricsWelcome to my realm
We're both condemned to live
It's a dark fate I
Can hear your calls
I can hear your calls
(Eternal life)
I see it still burns
Each night I cry in pain
Alive
Though the end appears my friend
And blood tears I cry
You've searched and you've found
Cut off your old friends hand
My mind's
In frozen dreams
Rotten flesh
Of bitter lies
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one ever will
Can't hold it, it burns
Each night I cry in pain
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
It seems so clearly
Bent the bow
Cause life in me is gone
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
(And a cruel wind's blowing cold)
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
(And a cruel wind's blowing cold)
In blame
(In blame)
In blame
And life it shall wane
Each night I cry in pain
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained
Cut off your old friends handEmbed
