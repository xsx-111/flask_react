Mirror Mirror LyricsFar, far beyond the island
We dwelt in shades of twilight
Through dread and weary days
Through grief and endless pain
It lies unknown
The land of mine
A hidden gate
To save us from the shadow fall
The lord of water spoke
In the silence words of wisdom
I've seen the end of all
Be aware the storm gets closer
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That tomorrow bears insanity?
Gone's the wisdom of a thousand years
A world in fire, in chains and fear
Leads me to a place so far
Deep down it lies my secret vision
I'll better keep it safe
Shall I leave my friends alone
Hidden in my twilight hall
I know the world is lost in fire
Sure there is no way to turn it
Back to the old days
Of bliss and cheerful laughter
We're lost in barren lands
Caught in the running flames
Alone
How shall we leave the lost road?
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?
Even though
The storm calmed down
The bitter end
Is just a matter of time
Shall we dare the dragon?
Merciless he's poisoning our hearts
Our hearts
How shall we leave the lost road?
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?2Embed
