When Sorrow Sang LyricsSo let me out of it
Out of the cold
To bring back the light and hope for all
And so if I could get you in
Just for a little while
Into the songs of sorrow
You might understand
Where am I now
Beyond the dawn
(Where) Hope's turned to dust
At all
Immortal love's
Fooled by the hands of doom
That love means death
I realized too soon
Caught in the afterlife
I've gone too far
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
The air was filled with tears
Full of sadness and grief
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
I feel like screaming
But I can't breath in
Shall I wane right now
I will not leave this
World of living
Till she has said
Goodbye
Out in the cold
I still wait for her call
And her last kiss
It shall be release
I can't forget her
Her face will not leave
From the depths of my soul
I long for her
Caught in the afterlife
I've gone to far
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
The air was filled with tears
Full of sadness and grief
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
So I heard all about it
Her voice's so clear
She's woven both themes in there
Moved me to tears
The world shall hear this sad song
Song of sorrow song of grief
Can't change the way of his kind
Can't change the way of her kind
Caught in the afterlife
I've gone to far
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
The air was filled with tears
Full of sadness and grief
When sorrow sang softly and sweetEmbed
