Thorn LyricsA black swan
Is born in that night
The misty pond
Got a new king
Got a new king
So what can we do with our lives
When it all begins
It's hard and it's cruel
Will grace die in pain? Will light ever rise again?
Oh, I'm trapped in darkness
Still I reach out for the stars
I'm moving in silence
I leave it all far behind
Chorus:
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Let us march on
To the fields of sacrifice, wondering why
I'll carry on
Will I betray myself to rise
In the silence
It's time to explain
Search for truth in lies
Useful lies
Needless love's damned
What can we do with our lives
When it all begins
Come follow me
And you will see
How it will be
When all the pain is gone away
Chorus:
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Let us march on
Though there's no hope at our side
Let us be brave
Though by glory we are denied
Bridge:
But don't you think
It's time for us
To bring to an end
Come play the song of death
The wisdom in us both
Will make it
Special guaranteed
Come play the song of death
I'm lost in the depth of his eyes I can't flee
Inner pain caused insanity
It's deep within
The fear and the hunger
Enslaved and denied by my love and my enemies
I'm the illgotten son
Chorus:
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thornsEmbed
