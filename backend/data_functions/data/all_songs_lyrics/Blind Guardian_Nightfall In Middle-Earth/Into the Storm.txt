Into the Storm LyricsGive it to me
I must have it
Precious treasure
I deserve it
Where can I run
How can I hide
The Silmarils
Gems of treelight
Their life belongs to me
Oh it's sweet how the Darkness is floating around
We are following the will of the one
Through the dark age and into the storm
And we are following the will of the one
Through the dark age and into the storm
Lord I'm mean
Blackheart show me
What you hold in hand
I still hunger for more
Release me
From my pain
Give it to me
How I need it
How I need it
How I need it
Where can I run
How can I hide
The Silmarils
Gems of treelight
Their life belongs to me
Oh it's sweet how the Darkness is floating around
We are following the will of the one
Through the dark age and into the storm
And we are following the will of the one
Through the dark age and into the storm
Lord I'm mean
I did my part
Now it's your turn
And remember
What you've promised
Where can I run
How can I hide
The Silmarils
Gems of treelight
Their life belongs to me
Oh it's sweet how the Darkness is floating around
We are following the will of the one
Through the dark age and into the storm
And we are following the will of the one
Through the dark age and into the storm
Lord I'm meanEmbed
