A Dark Passage Lyrics(I feel cold)
Facing the darkness
The light's gone away
Deep in his castle he said
All land be mine
There's one thing for sure
The triumph of shadow is near
Deep in his castle they sang
We shall not rest until all will be thine
All land is mine
You can be sure
"Don't dare me" the mighty one screamed
Smashed down the light
I will not rest till I'm king
Valinor's empty now, allied the elves and men
They shall be damned
Rise of Fall
A dark tale ends
Just wondering how, in the darkness
They found their way, to the right place
Children of the sun, second kindred
We call their race, treat them kindly
Born in the east, nightfearer
They moved westwards, towards the sunshine
Morning breath like, Short's their life
Dawn passes by, when the day comes
The field was lost
Hope had passed away
The sun went down
Beyond the sea
Dark was the hour
But day shall come again
Smashed down the light
I will not rest till it's done
Valinor's empty now, allied the elves and men
They shall be damned
Smashed down the light
I will not rest till I'm king
Valinor's empty now, allied the elves and men
They shall be damned
Clean my wounds
Wash away all fear
Let courage be mine
No one hears me crying
No song, no tale, which contains all the grief
Renowned the deeds, and the victims of defeat
Sit down on your chair and look out for your kin
With my eyes you'll see, with my ears you'll hear
You troubled my day and you've questioned my strength
Don't mess with the master of fate
Smashed down the light
I will not rest till it's done
Valinor's empty now, allied the elves and men
They shall be damned
I smashed down the light
Dared Valinor
I smashed down the light
Revenge will be mine
Slowly marching on
Still we're marching on
Slowly marching on
Still we're marching on
Slowly marching on
Still we're marching on
Slowly marching on
Still we're marching on
Slowly marching on
Still we're marching on
Slowly marching on
Still we're marching on...Embed
