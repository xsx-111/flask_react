The Eldar LyricsI've seen the moon
And the first sunrise
I'll leave it to the memories
And kiss the wind goodbye
Chorus:
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom
I've tasted poison
When I drank the wine of fate
But the fear was in my heart
I realised too late
The house of spirits call
Chorus:
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of the doom
High's the fee
Soon my spirit will return
Welcome dawn
Your light will take me home
I say farewell
Chorus:
To the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doomEmbed
