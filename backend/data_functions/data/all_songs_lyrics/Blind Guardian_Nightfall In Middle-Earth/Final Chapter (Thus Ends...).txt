Final Chapter (Thus Ends...) LyricsThus ends the fifth battle
By the treachery of Men the field is lost
The night falls and great is the triumph of evil
The league is broken
The last vestige of hope lives in the hidden king
Only he troubles the dark one's mind
Only he could bring ruin to the black foe
Though the land lies down in agony and the curse lives on
A new star shall arise
And a new day shall come, againEmbed
