Doom LyricsHow did I get here?
What will I find here?
The field is lost
All hope's now gone
I understand
There is no chance
The curse lives on
My children mourn
You'll be with me
For a long time
This place
You won't leave it
No more
Forever
Forever
I'm wondering
Who is it for?
There's nothing more
I won this war
Dared Valinor
You won't enter
You're deceived
They've sealed the secret place
Out
And day won't come, again
No
So, there's no relief
When truth shall be revealed
By now you know the answer
So there's no relief
But deceit
Abandoned, forgotten, deceieved
Wherever they may roam
So faithful, so loyal
Still no one will come
You're alone
Don't call it destiny
We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow
Doom
It's going down
Going down
And there is nothing
You can do
Look into my eyes
And see
Your seed it may grow
This is no vision
You'll be deceived
It's the curse
I set upon your kin
Their cries  shall come true
It shall be me
You blame
Now watch and see
I set doom
Upon you
Your offspring shall bloom
Wherever they may roam
I'll find them
I'll split them
In solitude sorrow shall grow
Unknown
We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow
Doom
If that's your choice
Your descendants
They wish
They have never been born
Redeem the oath
And pay the price
If you want
Here on these fields
Where truth shall be revealed
In doom you find the answer
Still there's no release
You shall feel
Let's face it
Since everything's shown
You've been through this alone
The deeper the wounds
So much greater
The sorrows will grow
There is no sense in it
We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow
