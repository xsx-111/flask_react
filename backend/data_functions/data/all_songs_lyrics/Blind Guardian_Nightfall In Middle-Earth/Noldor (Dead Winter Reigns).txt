Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns) LyricsNoldor
Blood is on your hands
Your bane's
A tearful destiny
Black clouds will carry rain of blood
I've seen it rain
I've seen it rain...
We were lost
On grinding ice
In fear and hunger
Dead winter reigned
In Araman
Can't escape
From my damnation
Run away
From isolation
Guilty spoke the one
This deed can't be undone
Hear my words
Fear my curse
I know
Where the stars glow
Sky's unclouded
Sweet the water runs my friend
Noldor
Blood is on your hands
Tears unnumbered
You will shet and dwell in pain
Your homeless souls
Shall come to me
There's no release
Slain you might be
Slain you will be
Slain you will be
And the lost
Who will not reach the
House of spirits
Grow old and weary
Can't escape
From my damnation
Run away
From isolation
Guilty spoke the one
This deed can't be undone
Hear my words
Fear my curse
I know
Where the stars glow
Sky's unclouded
Sweet the water runs my friend
Noldor
Blood is on your hands
Tears unnumbered
You will shet and dwell in pain
I've seen this bitter end
As I've foreseen
The storm and ice
And I could see it
A million died, and I?
The blame's on me
Cause I was not there
Can't escape
From my damnation
Run away
From isolation
Guilty spoke the one
This deed can't be undone
Hear my words
Fear my curse
I know
Where the stars glow
Sky's unclouded
Sweet the water runs my friend
Noldor
Blood is on your hands
Tears unnumbered
You will shet and dwell in pain
Dead winter reigns
And tomorrow's still unknown
Lies
Condemned and betrayed
Now everything's said
See my eyes
(Are) full of tears
And a cruel price
We've paid
But still I can't claim
That I'm innocent
