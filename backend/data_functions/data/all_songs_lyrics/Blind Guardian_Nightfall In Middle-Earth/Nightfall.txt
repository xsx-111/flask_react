Nightfall LyricsNo sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
All hope's lost, it cannot be undone
They're wasted and gone
Save me your speeches, I know
(They blinded us all)
What you want, you will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in is gone forever more
Like sorrowful seagulls they sang
Lost in the deep shades the misty cloud brought
(A wailing when beauty was gone, come take a look at the sky)
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
How long shall we mourn in the dark
The bliss and the beauty will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be
But even in silence, I heard the words
An oath we shall swear by the name of the one till the world's end
(Just wondering how I can still hear these voices inside)
It can't be broken
The doom of the Noldor drew near
The words of a banished king
I swear revenge
Filled with anger, aflamed our hearts
Full of hate, full of pride
Oh we screamed for revenge
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
Vala he is, that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
(But freely you came and
You freely shall depart)
Never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends
Oh I'm heir of the high lord
You better not trust him
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind
And finally you may follow me
Farewell, he said
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
Back to where it all began
Back to where it all began3Embed
