The Tides of War LyricsCall the wind
I hail thee
But sail on through the storm
There's fire in my mind
Fire in my mind
Fire in my mind
Fire in my mind
There's no escape
And there's no return
The blood and smoke behind us
It's now out of sight
Tears you might be crying
But it's over now
For a higher cause
We've come
So just keep your hate alive
(Chorus:)
The tides of war
The tides of war
We've come to face it
In these lands
We've come to face it
In these lands
The curse of Fëanor
Fëanor
No sorrow
No loss, I count the ones behind
Come follow
Don't turn your back
And let 'em whine
The grief is real
The pain I feel
It's not what I've been longing for
They shall be free
They'll be released
They can't get over the sea
They were following in vain
Burning vessels, burnin' hope
Needless baggage on the road
Let 'em curse me, let 'em blame
They may have faced
Their journey's end
Boats, at distant shore they burn
The wind still carries smoke
In Araman we've seen
Teleri's work on fire
Across the ice
Aflamed
To take revenge
Ashamed
Betrayed by the insane
Fëanor
You've gone too far
You've come to fail
Fëanor
All done in vain
By the oath
You delivered
Our doom
(Chorus)
The tides of war
The tides of war
We've come to face it
In these lands
We've come to face it
In these lands
The curse of Fëanor
Fëanor
(Instrumental)
Boats, at distant shore they burn
The wind still carries smoke
In Araman we've seen
Teleri's work on fire
Across the ice
Aflamed
To take revenge
Ashamed
Betrayed by the insane
Fëanor
We've gone too far
We've come to fail
Fëanor
Yet we have reached
The promised land
Oh, Fëanor
(Chorus:)
The tides of war
The tides of war
We've come to face it
In these lands
We've come to face it
In these lands
The curse of Fëanor
FëanorEmbed
