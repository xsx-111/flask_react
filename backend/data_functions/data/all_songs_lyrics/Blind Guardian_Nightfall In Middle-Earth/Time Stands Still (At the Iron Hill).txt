Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill) LyricsLight fails at dawn
The moon is gone
And deadly the night reigns
Deceit
Finally I've found myself in these lands
Horror and madness I've seen here
For what I became a king of the lost?
Barren and lifeless the land lies
Lord of all Noldor a star in the night
And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord
The fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
The fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
I stand alone
No one's by my side
I'll dare you, come out
You coward
Now it's me or you
He gleams like a star
And the sound of his horn's
Like a raging storm
Proudly the high lord
Challenges the doom
Lord of slaves he cries
Slowly in fear
The dark lord appears
Welcome to my lands
You shall be damned
Lord of all Noldor a star in the night
And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord
The fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
The fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
The iron crowned is getting closer
Swings his hammer down on him
Like a thunderstorm he's crushing
Down the noldor's proudest king
Under my foot
So hopeless it seems
You've troubled my day
Now feel the pain
Lord of all Noldor, a star in the night
And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord
The fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
The fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
The elvenking's broken
He stumbles and falls
The most proud and most valiant
His spirit survives
Praise our king, praise our king
Praise our king, praise our king1Embed
