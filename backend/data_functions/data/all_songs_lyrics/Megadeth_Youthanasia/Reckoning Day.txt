Reckoning Day Lyrics

I like the way that I make you itch
And all the reasons I give you to bitch
And how I make you wanna scream in pain
And feel your life is just a losing game
I like the way that you let me in
The way you look when the walls cave in
I like the way that your stomach knots
And how you cry for it all to stop
I like the way that you fool yourself
And make believe there's nobody else
I like the way that you stand in line
And beg salvation from the empty skies, empty skies

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no payback time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning day, day, day, day

I like the things that you try to fake
And your face when I see you break
And that you say you will pray for me
You realise you are prey for me
I like the way you stay on attack
No matter what, I keep coming back
And how you try to hold me down
But you end up driven to the ground, to the ground
Don't want no revenge
Ain't no payback time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning


Don't want no revenge (don't want no revenge)
Ain't no payback time (ain't no payback time)
It ain't called getting even (it ain't called getting even)
Here comes the reckoning
Here comes the reckoning day, day, day

Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning
Here comes the reckoning day
Oh, here it comes...
It's coming to getcha...
