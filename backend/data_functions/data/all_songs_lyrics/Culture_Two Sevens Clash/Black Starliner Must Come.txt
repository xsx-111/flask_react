Black Starliner Must Come LyricsOh if I knew yesterday what I know now
Things would be different
Today would be excellent of course
They took us away from our homeland
They took us away from our homeland
And we are slaving down here in Babylon
And we are slaving down here in Babylon
They are waiting on an opportunity
They are waiting on an opportunity
For the Black Starliner which is to come
For the Black Starliner which is to come
Not long Jah Jah Jah Jah not long
Not long Jah Jah Jah Jah not long
We are waiting on the Black Starliner
And we are still waiting on the Black Starliner
Wait on Jah
Wait on His works
I meekly wait and murmur not
I meekly wait and murmur not
For the Black Starliner shall come
For the Black Starliner must come
Still waiting on that opportunity
We are still waiting on the same opportunity
For the Black Starliner which is to come
For the Black Starliner which is to come
Marcus say so
Oh land of Africa
Holy Mount Africa
We want, we want to go
We want, we want to go
Sierra Leone and Ghana
Zimbabwe, Ethiopia
We want, we want to go (in a Kenya)
We want, we want to go
They took us away from our homeland
They took us away from our homeland
And we are slaving down here in Babylon
Don't want to be slaving down here in Babylon
Ethiopia stretch forth her hands
Ghana, say come home brother
We are slaving down here in Babylon
And we are slaving down here in Babylon
We want go eat fufu and palm wine
Eat some nice fish and have nice time
We are slaving down here in Babylon
We are slaving down here in Babylon
Want go look nice ladies
Want to see mother with their babies
We are slaving down here in Babylon
This is eternal hell
We are slaving down here in Babylon
Nothing for us
We are slaving down here in Babylon
And it a run red
We are slaving down here in BabylonEmbed
