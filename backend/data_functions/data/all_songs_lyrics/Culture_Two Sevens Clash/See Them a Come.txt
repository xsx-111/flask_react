See Them a Come Lyrics
Jah Jah see dem a come, but I and I a conqueror
Jah Jah see dem a come, but I and I a conqueror

They are coming to accuse I for things I know not about
They are coming to lock I down, and tell I that dem suspicious Yeah

Jah Jah see dem a come, but I and I a conqueror
Jah Jah see dem a come, hey!
But I and I a conqueror

Owner of thy peace
Oh, Jah of my salvation
For the mouth of the wicked and deceitful is upon I

Jah Jah see dem a come, watch deh!
But I and I a conqueror
Jah Jah see dem a come, ah
But I and I a conqueror, mmm

My good friend, William Gordon, and Paul Bogle was here
Mosiah Garvey, Mosiah Garvey, and they gave him away
"Yeah? Fi wha'?"
One pound of rice, three tin of red peas...
One dread nut, and a piece of raw, raw meat

Jah Jah see dem a come, I!
But I and I a conqueror
Jah Jah see dem a come, hey!
But I and I a conqueror
Jah Jah see dem a come, dread
But I and I a conqueror, ah

The scribes and Pharisees who sit in Moses seat
While partial in the words of Jah, but their works are not complete
So, look

Jah Jah see them a come, eh
But I and I a conqueror
Jah Jah see them a come, with the whip
But I and I a conqueror
Jah Jah see them a come, with the batton
But I and I a conqueror
Jah Jah see them a come, with the gun
But I and I a conqueror
I'm not afraid for the terror by night
Nor for the pestilence that waiteth at noonday
To catch Jah Jah children to take them away

Jah Jah see them a come, ah
But I and I a conqueror
Jah Jah see them a come, oh
But I and I a conqueror
I'm not afraid
I've got to tell you
I've got to...
I've got to tell you
Tell you tell you..
Yeah!
But I and I a conqueror...Embed
