Jah Pretty Face LyricsHallelujah!
I and I a want to see King Rastafari
To look upon Jah pretty pretty face
We want to walk the streets of glory
Shining around Jah throne
So Natty Dread tell all the gentles them to come
Run come to look upon Jah pretty pretty face
For we are going home, going home
To see King Rastafari
Selassie a the roots of David
Hallelujah! I, I a Congo I
King Selassie a the roots of David, chant it out
Hallelujah! I, I a Congo I
King Selassie a the roots of David
Hallelujah! I, I a Congo I
Hallelujah!
(solo)
King Selassie a the roots of David
Hallelujah! I, I a Congo I
Selassie a the roots of David
Hallelujah!
Selassie a the roots of David
Hallelujah!
With your loud voice say
Hallelujah!
I, I a Congo I
Hallelujah!
Mount Zion bird shall sing and say
Hallelujah!
Chant it from the throne, let them hear it
Hallelujah!Embed
