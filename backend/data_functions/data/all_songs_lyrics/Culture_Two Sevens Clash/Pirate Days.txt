Pirate Days LyricsThere's nothing near as quiet as the light, I'm looking for
Last time that it appeared, he was lying next to me
Last time I felt his near to whispered ecstasy
And those who need adventure
They can sail the seven seas
And those who search for treasure
They must live on grander dreams
We rose and fell just like the tides
He filled my heart and soul
And I buried all my dreams for someone else to find
In my pirate days
This world is kinder to the kind that won't look back
They are the chosen few, among us now, unbowed somehow
One day he turned to me and before I took one breath
I knew, I would only see his shadow in what light was left
And those who need adventure
They can sail the seven seas
And those who search for treasure
They must live on grander dreams
If I've seen his face since then
It's only been in dreams my friend
Since I came to the end
Of my pirate days
If I've called his name since then
It's only been in dreams my friend
And so I came to the end
Of my pirate days
There's nothing near as quiet as the light, I'm looking for
Last time that it appeared, he was lying next to meEmbed
