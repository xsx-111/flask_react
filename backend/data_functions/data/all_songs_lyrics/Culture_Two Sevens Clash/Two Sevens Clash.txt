Two Sevens Clash LyricsWhat a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash
My good old prophet Marcus Garvey prophesised it
St Jago de la Vega and Kingston is going to meet,
And I can see with mine own eyes
It's only a housing scheme that divides
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash, Natty Dread
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash
Look up a cotton tree out by Ferry police station
How beautiful it used to be
And it has been destroyed by lightning
Earthquake and thunder, I say
What!
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash, Natty Dread
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash
I take a ride sometimes
On Penn Overland and Bronx
And sometimes I ride on bus X82
Say what!
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash
Marcus Garvey was inside
Of Spanish Town District Prison
And when they were about to take him out
He prophesised and said
As I pass through this gate
No other prisoner shall enter and get through
And so it is until now
The gate has been locked
What!
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash, Natty Dread
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash, it bitter, bitter, bitter
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash, I-man a go feel it
What a live an bamba yay
When the two sevens clash, you better do rightEmbed
