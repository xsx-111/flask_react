Love Me Tomorrow Lyrics
She said, "It's lonely here tonight"
She's always sad when she's alone
She said, "I need you here tonight"
She couldn't wait until I get home

She loves me and that's all I need to know
She's part of my life
Just a part I won't let go
Then she said

Love me tomorrow Won't you please promise me?
Love me tomorrow like today
Love me tomorrow, hurry back
Can't you see I need you much more than yesterday?

You know it's always cold at night
It's always lonely until the dawn
And though it's not what we both want
Knowing she's there, I'll carry on

She loves me and that's all I need to know
She's part of my life
Just a part I won't let go
Then she said
Love me tomorrow Won't you please promise me?
Love me tomorrow like today
Love me tomorrow, hurry back
Can't you see I need you more than any words can say?

She loves me and that's all I need to know
She's part of my life
Just a part I won't let go
Then she said

Love me tomorrow Won't you please promise me?
Love me tomorrow like today
Love me tomorrow, hurry back
Can't you see I need you more than any words can say?

Love me tomorrow, love me tomorrow like today
Love me tomorrow, I need you much more than yesterdayEmbed
