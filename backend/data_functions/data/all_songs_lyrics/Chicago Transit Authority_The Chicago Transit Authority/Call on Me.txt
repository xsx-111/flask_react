Call on Me Lyrics
The feeling was clear
Clear as a blue sky on a sunny day
Everything was you, ooh
Because no one made me feel
The way I felt with you, oh-woah
Call on me 'cause

I love you
You know I do
You love me too

Then came a change
When I said I would soon be leaving you
Nothing else to do, ooh
But please remember I
Never lose the thought of you
Call on me 'cause

I love you
You know I do
You love me too

You've got to find
Someone else to somehow take my place
Share his life with you, ooh
But if you need a friend
You can always count on me
Count on me 'cause

I love you
You know I do
You love me too

You can count on me, oh
You can count on me
You can count on me, baby
You can count on me
You can count on me, oh
You can count on me
You can count on me, baby
You can count on me
You can count on me, oh
You can count on me
You can count on me, baby
You can count on me
You can count on me, oh
You can count on me
You can count on me, baby
You can count on me1Embed
