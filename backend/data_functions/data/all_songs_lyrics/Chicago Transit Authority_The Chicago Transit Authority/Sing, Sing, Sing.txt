Sing, Sing, Sing Lyrics
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Everybody's got to sing, ooh
Stick with us we'll have a ball
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Everybody's got to sing, ooh
Stick around, we'll have it all

Music brightens up the day
Now, if you like it we will stay

(We're gon') Sing, sing, sing, sing
(We're gonna sing) Everybody's got to sing, ooh
Stick around, shake it down
