No Tell Lover Lyrics
Pretty smile, lovely face, and a warm breeze
Now I need you, lady
You're my no tell lover
Every night in a different place
I'll meet you, tender lady
You're my no tell lover
Ooh ooh ooh

Everyone keeps telling me that this affair's not meant to be
Even though I need you night and day
Walk away if you see me coming, even though it's you
I'm loving

Every minute is an hour
Every day's a lonely lifetime
You're my no tell lover
The little time that we spend together just can't last forever
You're my no tell lover
Yeah

Everyone keeps tellin' me that this affair's not meant to be
Even though I need you night and day
Walk away if you see me coming, even though it's you
I'm lovin'
I want her
I can't leave her
I won't live without her
There's nothing left to say
I want her
I can't leave her

Every night in a different place I'll need you, tender lady
You're my no tell lover
Ooh ooh ooh

Everyone keeps tellin' me this affair's not meant to be
Even though I need you night and day
Walk away if you see me coming, even though it's you I'm lovin'

I want her
I can't leave her
I won't live without her
(She's my no tell lover)
I want her
I can't leave her
I won't live without her
(She's my no tell lover)
I want her
I can't leave her
I won't live without her
(She's my no tell lover)
I want her
I can't leave her
I won't live without her...Embed
