If She Would Have Been Faithful... Lyrics
I was thinking about her
Visiting the past
Reconstructing details with old photographs
Studying the faces
With an objective point of view
Suddenly remembering doesn't haunt me
At the time you couldn't tell me
That one day I'd be glad
That something that I thought was love was misinterpreted
She had another lover, she emphatically denied
But they were doing me a favor
A blessing in disguise

If she would have been faithful
If she could have been true
Then I would've been cheated
I would never know real love
I would've missed out on you

I watch you sleeping, your body touching me
There's no doubt about it
This is where I want to be
You know it's so ironic, I had to lose to win
I want to thank her (Thank her again)
If she would have been faithful
If she could have been true
Then I would've been cheated
I would never know real love
I would've missed out on you

It's a paradox, full of contradiction
How I got from there to here
It defies a
Logical explanation

If she would have been faithful
If she could have been true
Then I would've been cheated
I would never know real love
I would've missed out on you (Missed out on you)
If she would have been faithful
If she could have been true
Then I would've been cheated
I would never know real love
I would've missed out on you (Missed out on you)

If she would have been faithful (If she would have been faithful)
If she would have been faithful (If she would have been faithful)
If she would have been faithful (If she would have been faithful)
If she would have been faithfulEmbed
