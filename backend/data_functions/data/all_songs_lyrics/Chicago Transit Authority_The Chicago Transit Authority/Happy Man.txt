Happy Man Lyrics
Merely by chance
Very unsuspecting
You caught my heart
Unprotecting me
Now I'm fallin' in love with you

Just when I thought
I was free and easy
You came along
To me soft and breezy
Now I've fallen in love with you

Woo hoo
I've fallen in love with you

And for the first time in my life
I know what it's like to be a happy man, mhm
Happy man
And for the first time in my life
You've given me something I can understand, mhm
Being a happy man
Be with me now
Love me forever
Leaving you lady
Was something that I'd never do
I've fallen in love with you

All of my life
It seems I have waited
Now I can say
All these words I have stated are true
I've fallen in love with you

Woo hoo
I've fallen in love with you
Woo hoo
Ooh, uh1Embed
