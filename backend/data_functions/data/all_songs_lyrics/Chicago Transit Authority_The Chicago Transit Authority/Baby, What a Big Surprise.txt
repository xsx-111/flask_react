Baby, What a Big Surprise Lyrics
Right before my very eyes
I thought that you were only faking it
And like before, my heart was taking it

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Oh whoa whoa whoa

Yesterday, it seemed to me
My life was nothing more than wasted time
But here today you've softly changed my mind

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Ho ho-oh
Oh whoa oh whoa

Just to be alone
Was a little more than I could take
Then you came to stay
Ooh ooh
Hold me in the morning
Love me in the afternoon
Help me find my way
Yeah yeah
Now and then just like before
I think about the love I've thrown away
But now it doesn't matter anyway

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Ho ho-oh
Oh whoa oh whoa
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes (Ooh whoa oh)
Ho ho-oh
Oh whoa oh whoa
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Ho ho-oh
Oh whoa oh whoa
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Ho ho-oh
Oh whoa oh whoa
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyesEmbed
