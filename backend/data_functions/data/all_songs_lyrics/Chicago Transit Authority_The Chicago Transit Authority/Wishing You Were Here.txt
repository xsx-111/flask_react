Wishing You Were Here Lyrics
Sleepless hours and dreamless nights and far aways
Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)
Heaven knows, and Lord it shows, when I'm away
Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

Same old show in a different town on another time
Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)
Even though you're far away, you're on my mind
Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

And I'd like to change my life, and you know I would
Just to be with you tonight, baby, if I could
But I've got my job to do, and I do it well, oh
(Change my life, change my life)
So I guess that's how it is
Ooh, wishing you were here
Ooh, wishing you were here
Ooh, wishing you were here (Wishing you were here)
Wishing you were here (You were here)

On the road it's a heavy load, but I'll be by
Ooh ooh ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)
Pay the price, make a sacrifice, and still I'll try
Ooh ooh ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)

Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)
Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)
Wishing you were here
Wishing
