Take Me Back to Chicago Lyrics
Take me back to Chicago
Lay my soul to rest
Where my life was free and easy
Remember me at my best
Take me back to Chicago
Where music was all I had
I tried to be good as I could
And sometimes that made me sad

Take me back to Chicago
To Chicago, oh oh
Why don't you take me back?
Take me back, take me back
To Chicago

I still dream of the lake of peacefulness
The warm summer breeze
'Cause my life was so much simpler then
Street corners and Tastee Freeze
Take me back to Chicago
'Cause hustling's not my style
L.A. was just a bit too hard
I wish I could be a child
Living back in Chicago
In Chicago, whoa
Take me back, take me back, take me back
To Chicago
To Chicago oh oh


Take me back to Chicago
And lay my soul to rest
Where my life was free and easy
Remember me at my best
Take me back to Chicago
'Cause hustling's not my style
L.A. was just a bit too hard
I wish I could be a child

Living back in Chicago
In Chicago hey, yeah
Take me back, take me back, take me back
To Chicago, to Chicago

Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back (Take me back, take me)
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me backEmbed
