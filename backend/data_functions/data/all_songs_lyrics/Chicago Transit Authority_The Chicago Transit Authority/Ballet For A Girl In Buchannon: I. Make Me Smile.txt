Ballet For A Girl In Buchannon: I. Make Me Smile Lyrics
Children play in the park, they don't know
I'm alone in the dark, even though
Time and time again I see your face smiling inside-ide

I'm so happy (Oh yeah)
That you love me (Oh yeah)
Life is lovely (It is, oh)
When you're near me
Tell me, you will stay?
Make me smile

Living life is just a game, so they say, hey
All the games we used to play
Fade away, ooh
We may now enjoy those dreams we shared so long ago

Oh, my darling (Oh oh)
Got to have you (Yeah yeah)
Feel the magic (Ooh ooh whoa)
When I hold you (Hold you)
Cry sweet tears of joy
Touch the sky


Now I need you
More than ever
No more crying
We're together
Tell me, you will stay
Make me smile2Embed
