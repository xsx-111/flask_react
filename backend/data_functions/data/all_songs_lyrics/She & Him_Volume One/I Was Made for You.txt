I Was Made for You LyricsI was takin' a walk
When I saw you pass by
I thought I saw you lookin' my way so I thought I'd give you a try
When I saw you smile
I saw a dream come true
So I asked you, maybe
Baby whatcha gonna do?
Cause I have been waitin' for a long long time
For a boy like you
I won't be waitin' anymore cause I know:
Baby, Baby
I was made for you

I was takin' a walk
When I saw you pass by
I thought I saw you lookin' my way so I thought I'd give you a try
When I saw you smile
I saw a dream come true
So I asked you, maybe
Baby whatcha gonna do?
Cause I have been waitin' for a long long time
For a boy like you
I won't be waitin' anymore cause I know
Baby, Baby
I was made for you
I was made for you
I was made for you
Yeah, I was made for you
I was made for you1Embed
