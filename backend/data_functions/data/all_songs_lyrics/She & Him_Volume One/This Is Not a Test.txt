This Is Not a Test Lyrics
For those of you who tried, but didn't make it
Settle down - it's never what you think
The summit doesn't differ from the deep, dark valley
And the valley doesn't differ from the kitchen sink

For those of you who thought you'd be forgotten
The friends you've made will try their best, to make it so
Think of all the beauty that you left behind you
You can take it if you want it, and then let it go

And this is not a test
No, this is not a test
Taking numbers never made sense, anyways
No, this is not a test
No, this is not a test
Cause you can have it, if you want it, anyways

For those of us who try to keep remembering
Try to do our better than our best
Think of all the children in the drifts of snow
Winners never quit, but winters never rest
And this is not a test
No, this is not a test
Taking numbers never made sense, anyways
No, this is not a test
No, this is not a test
Cause you can have it, if you want it, anyways

No this is not a test
No, this is not a test
Taking numbers never made sense, anywaysEmbed
