I Thought I Saw Your Face Today Lyrics
I thought I saw your face today, but I just turned my head away
Your face against the trees
But I just see the memories as they come, as they come
And I couldn't help but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again

I saw it glitter as I grew
And loved it boy, I never knew
I thought this place was heaven sent
But now it's just a monument in my mind, in my mind
And I couldn't help but fall in love again
No I couldn't help but fall in love again

The cars and freeways Implore me to stay away out of this place
My mother said "Just keep your head and play it as it lays"


The cars and freeways Implore me to stay away out of this place
My mother said "Just keep your head and play it as it lays"

I somehow see what's beautiful in things that are ephemeral
I'm my only friend of mine, love is just a piece of time
In the world, in the world
And I couldn't help
But fall in love again
No I couldn't help but fall in love again
No I couldn't help but fall in love again
No I couldn't help but fall in love again
No I couldn't help but fall in love again
No I couldn't help but fall in love again
No I couldn't help but fall in love again1Embed
