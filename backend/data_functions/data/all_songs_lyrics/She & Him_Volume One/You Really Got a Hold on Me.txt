You Really Got a Hold on Me Lyrics
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, You do me wrong now
My love is stronger
You've really got a hold on me
I said you've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

Hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold meEmbed
