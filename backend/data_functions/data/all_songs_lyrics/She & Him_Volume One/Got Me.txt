Got Me Lyrics
Saw your face
My hand you took
Just like in a storybook
And you got me
Yeah, you got me

I can't even argue
Couldn't, cause it's true
Now you got me
Yeah, you got me

Got me tucked up in your pocket
Don't know how you won my heart
Cause I'd locked it
Yeah, I'd locked it

I can't feel your heartbeat
Where I lay my head
Cause you got me
Yeah, you got me

I can't feel your heartbeat
Where I lay my head
Cause you got me
Yeah, you got me
Got me tucked up in your pocket
Don't know how you won my heart
Cause I'd locked it
Yeah, I'd locked itEmbed
