Black Hole Lyrics
My eyes are
So bleary
I guess I'm young, but I feel so weary

I've tried to express it, but I think it's all a bore
It's at the heart of me
A very part of me

Speak slowly, I can't hear you
My mind keeps spinning closer and closer
To the rain on the roof
And the rain in my head
And the things that you said
Keep on taking further ahead

And it just gets so foggy
It's nowhere in here
And it's everywhere else
That I don't want to be

But I'm stuck here
Getting misty over you
I'm alone, on a bicycle for two
Speak slowly, I can't hear you
My mind keeps spinning closer and closer
To the rain on the roof
And the rain in my head
And the things that you said
Keep on taking further ahead

And it just gets so foggy
It's nowhere in here
And it's everywhere else
That I don't want to be

But I'm stuck here
Getting misty over you
I'm alone, on a bicycle for twoEmbed
