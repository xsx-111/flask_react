Take It Back LyricsTake it back
Oh, take it back
I don't want your lovin' anymore
Let me live, oh let me live
It's not you who I sing for
So don't sit next to me
Sit by yourself
I don't wanna wonder whether you love me
I don't wanna wonder whether you care
So don't try to woo me
Don't try to fool me
Oh, I know all of your tricks
It's the possibility of stayin' in my corner
I don't wanna wonder whether you love me
I don't wanna wonder whether you care
So don't try to woo me
Don't try to fool me
Oh, I know all of your tricks
It's the possibility of stayin' in my cornerEmbed
