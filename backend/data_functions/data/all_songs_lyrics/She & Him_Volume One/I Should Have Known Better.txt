I Should Have Known Better Lyrics
I should have known better with a guy like you
That I would love everything that you do, and I do
Hey hey hey, and I do

Whoa whoa, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too
Oh oh, and when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

Whoa whoa, I, never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't' you see?
Oh

That when I tell you that I love you, oh (Oh)
You're gonna say you love me too (Oh)
Oh, and when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too1Embed
