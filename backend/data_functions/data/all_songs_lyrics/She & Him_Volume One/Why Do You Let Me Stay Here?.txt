Why Do You Let Me Stay Here? Lyrics
Why do you let me stay here
All by myself?
Why don't you come and play here?
I'm just sitting on the shelf

Why don't you sit right down and stay a while?
We like the same things and I like your style
It's not a secret, why do you keep it?
I'm just sitting on the shelf

I've gotta get your presence
(aaaaaah)
Let's make it known
(aaaaaah)
I think you're just so pleasant
I would like you for my own

Why don't you sit right down and make me smile? (uh-oh)
You make me feel like I am just a child
Why do you end it?, Just give me credit
I'm just sitting on the shelf
Aaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaah
(Aaaaaaaaaah ta-da-tu-rup-tap)
(Aaaaaaaaaah ta-da-tu-rup-tap)
(Aaaaaaaaaah ta-da-tu-rup-tap)
(Aaaaaaaaaah ta-da-tu-rup-tap)
(Aaaaaaaaaah ta-da-tu-rup-tap)
(Aaaaaaaaaah ta-da-tu-rup-tap)2Embed
