Sentimental Heart Lyrics
Cried all night until there was nothing more
What use am I as a heap on the floor?
Heaving devotion but it's just no good
Taking it hard just like you knew I would

Old habits die hard
When you got, when you got a sentimental heart
Piece of the puzzle and you're my missing part
Oh, what can you do with a sentimental heart?
Oh, what can you do with a sentimental heart

Cried all night until there was nothing more
What use am I as a heap on the floor?
Heaving devotion but it's just no good
Taking it hard just like you knew I would

Old habits die hard
When you got, when you got a sentimental heart
Piece of the puzzle and you're my missing part
Oh, what can you do with a sentimental heart?
Oh, what can you do with a sentimental heart
Oh, what can you do with a sentimental heart
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh4Embed
