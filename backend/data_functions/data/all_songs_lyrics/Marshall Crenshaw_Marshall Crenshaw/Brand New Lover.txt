Brand New Lover Lyrics(M. Crenshaw)
I'm feelin' dazed and dissipated
I only know one thing for sure
Gotta find me a brand new lover
There isn't any other cure
All my lowdown lonely feelings
Have been working overtime somehow
Gotta find me a brand new lover
I know it better be right now
Right now, right now, right now now, right now
I've got to make some changes
Before the walls close in
I tell you what I'm gonna do
When the night comes down babe I'm lookin' for you
I need some consolation
Baby come and take my hand
Gotta find me a brand new lover
I'm achin' more than I can stand
All my lowdown lonely feelings
Have been working overtime somehow
Gotta find me a brand new lover
I know it better be right now
Right now, right now, right now now, right now
I've got to make some changes
Before the walls close in
I tell you what I'm gonna do
When the night comes down babe I'm lookin' for you
I'm dazed and dissipated
I only know one thing for sure
Gotta find me a brand new lover
There isn't any other cureEmbed
