Starlit Summer Sky (demo 1979) Lyrics(marshall crenshaw / rick cioffi / fred todd)
The heat of day begins to die
The faintest breeze comes driftin' by
And you and I we watch the clouds roll by
Holding hands beneath the starlit summer sky
Each night we talk about the day
When we run out of things to say
We sit and gaze into each other's eyes
And we kiss beneath the starlit summer sky
Sometimes the best words are left unspoken
Sometimes the best words are left unsaid
Sometimes it's nobody else's business
Together, tonight, you know that it's right
We sit and gaze into each other's eyes
And we kiss beneath the starlit summer sky
Sometimes the best words are left unspoken
Sometimes the best words are left unsaid
Sometimes it's nobody else's business
Together, tonight, you know that it's right
The heat of the day begins to die
The faintest breeze comes drifting by
And you and I we watch the clouds roll by
Holding hands beneath the starlit summer sky
(starlit summer sky)
'neath the starlit summer sky...Embed
