Look at What I Almost Missed (live 1982) Lyrics(george clinton / tamla lewis )
So glad that I didn't resist
And look at what I almost missed
So glad that I didn't resist
And look at what I almost missed
I was always a sensible guy
I was so small
I always felt a guard uh, around my heart
But then uh you came
And like a giant wind you swept me offa my feet
I had, no no defense
Although you're no good for me, I said
Oh you're so good to me!
And baby it's good to say...
Hey hey hey, come on now now
So glad that I didn't resist
Look at what I almost missed
So glad that I didn't resist
Now look at what I almost missed
I was curious as to how your lips were gonna taste of mine
I thought that I would give it a try
Well it was so good, oh right or wrong
I had to carry on
I could not touch you no (? )
If curiosity killed the cat
Satisfaction sure brought him back
And baby I'm satisfied
