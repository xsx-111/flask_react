Someday, Someway Lyrics
I can't stand to see you sad
I can't bear to hear you cry
If you can't tell me what you need
All I can do is wonder why

Someday, someway aww
Someday, someway, yeah now
Someday, someway
Maybe I'll understand you

After all you've done for me
All I really want to do
Is take the love you brought my way
And give it all right back to you

Someday, someway awww
Someday, someway yeah yeah
Someday, someway
Maybe you'll understand me

You've taken everything from me
I've taken everything from you
I'll love you for my whole life through
Now after all you've done for me
All I really want to do
Is take the love you brought my way
And give it all right back to you

Someday, someway aww
Someday, someway, yeah now
Someday, someway
Maybe you'll understand me

You've taken everything from me
I've taken everything from you
I'll love you for my whole life through

I can't stand to see you sad
I can't bear to hear you cry
If you can't tell me what you need
All I can do is wonder why

Someday, someway aww
Someday, someway, yeah yeah
Someday, someway
Maybe I'll understand you
Someday, someway aww
Someday, someway, yeah yeah
Someday, someway
Maybe you'll understand me

Someday, someway oh!
Someday, someway, now now
Someday, someway
Maybe I'll understand you

Someday, someway whoa whoa
Someday, someway, yeah yeah
