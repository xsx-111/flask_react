The Usual Thing Lyrics(M. Crenshaw)
Chorus:
Don't want to know about the usual thing
I never bother with the usual thing
And I only wanna shout wanna shout wanna feel alive
Do whatever I wanna do
Just forget about the usual thing
I never bother with the usual thing
And if I didn't think you were a little bit out there too
I just wouldn't bother with you
I just wouldn't bother with you
I wanna take you with me
I'll do most anything that you want to
When we go out together
We must run wild but first I'm warning you
Chorus
I wanna give you somethin'
I just don't want to lose my energy
That's why I keep on trying
To only be true to what's inside of me
Chorus (x2)Embed
