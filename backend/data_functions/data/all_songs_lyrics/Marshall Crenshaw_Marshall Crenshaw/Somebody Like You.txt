Somebody Like You Lyrics(Marshall Crenshaw )
I'm so bewildered when I think about you
How can you mean all the things that you do?
Well baby
Somebody, somebody like you
Somebody, somebody like you
Somebody, somebody like you
I shouldn't be expectin' too much
From somebody like you
I cannot stand and knows you're listenin' too
Why did I ever get involved with you?
Hey baby
Somebody, somebody like you
Somebody, somebody like you
Somebody, somebody like you
I shouldn't be expectin' too much
From somebody like you
Now it's hurts me to conceed
That I ever believed a single word you said
Now I feel just like a fool
And it's puttin' such a strain on my heart and my head
Some people know a thing or two
But then some people are people like you
Hey baby
Somebody, somebody like you
Somebody, somebody like you
Aw somebody, somebody like you
I shouldn't be expectin' too much
From somebody like you
Now some people know a thing or two
And then some people are people like you
Oh baby
Somebody, somebody like you
Now somebody, somebody like you
Aw somebody, somebody like you
I shouldn't be expectin' too much
From somebody like you
Somebody like you...Embed
