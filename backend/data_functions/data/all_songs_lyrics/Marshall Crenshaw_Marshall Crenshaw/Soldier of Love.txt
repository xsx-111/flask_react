Soldier of Love Lyrics(B. Cason, T. Moon)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of Love)
And surrender to me (sha la la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (sha la la la) yeah (sha la)
Use your arms for loving me
Baby that's the way it's gotta be
There ain't no reason for you to declare
War on the one that loves you so
So forget the other boys
'Cause my love is real
Come off your battlefield
Lay down your arms (Soldier of Love)
And just surrender to me (sha la la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me tenderly (sha la la) yeah (sha la)
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't want to fight no more
The weapons you're using are hurtin' me bad
And someday you're gonna see
That my love pretty baby is the truest you've ever had
A soldier of love is hard to be
Lay down your arms (Soldier of Love)
And surrender to me (sha la la)
Now lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me tenderly (sha la la la) yeah (sha la)
Use your arms to please and squeeze
Cause I'm the one that loves you so
Oh, lay down your arms
I said, lay down your armsEmbed
