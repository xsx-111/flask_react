Not for Me Lyrics(M. Crenshaw)
I see you standin' helpless
Afraid to face a little sadness
If I follow your direction
Where would I be?
But I don't have to wonder I know definitely
That it's just not for me
Yeah I know what happened last time
And someday you'll wake up to find that
You've be waiting around for something
You'll never see
I don't have to wonder I know definitely
That it's just not for me
So I know what not to do
Cause I learned it from you yeah
Now I feel sorry for you
And I hope that someday I can thank you
Now you're still waiting around for something
You'll never see
I don't have to wonder I know definitely
That it's just not for me
So I know what not to do
Cause I learned from you
I feel sorry for you
And I hope that someday I can thank you
I know what happened last time
But you'll never recover lost time
If I follow your direction
Where would I be?
I don't have to wonder I know definitely
That it's just not for meEmbed
