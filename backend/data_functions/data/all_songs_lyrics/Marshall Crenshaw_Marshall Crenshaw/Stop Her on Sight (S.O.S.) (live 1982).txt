Stop Her on Sight (S.O.S.) (live 1982) Lyrics(Albert Hamilton / Richard Morris / Charles Flatcher )
Hey hey hey I'm sendin'
Out an S.O.S
(sendin' sendin')
Hey hey hey I'm sendin'
(yes I am)
Out an S.O.S
I'm sendin' out an S.O.S
Because I'm havin' so much distress
So if you see my baby
If anybody sees my baby
Stop her on sight
Hey hey hey I'm sendin'
(hey now)
Out an S.O.S
Hey hey I'm sendin'
Out an S.O.S
(don't you know I am)
I'm gonna call the F.B.I
Maybe get myself a secret spy
Because I lost my baby
Oh if anybody sees my baby
Stop her on sight
Oh!
I lost her!
Lost my baby!
Yeah, yeah, yay-yeah!
You can tell her by the way she walks
You can tell her, by the way she talks uh
You can tell her, by the way she smiles
I guarantee you it will drive you wild
So if you see my baby
Oh if anybody sees my baby
Won't you stop her on sight?
Hey hey hey I'm sendin'
(yes I am)
Out an S.O.S
(woah I miss my baby so!)
Hey hey hey I'm sendin'
(hey now)
Out an S.O.S
(I don't know, don't know where she's gone)
Hey hey hey I'm sendin'
(don't you know I am)
Out an S.O.S
(come on help me find my baby)
Hey hey hey I'm sendin'
(hey now)
Out an S.O.SEmbed
