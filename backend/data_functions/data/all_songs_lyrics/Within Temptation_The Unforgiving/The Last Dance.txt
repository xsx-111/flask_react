The Last Dance LyricsYah yah yah yah yah hoh yah oh*
Yah yah yah yah yah hoh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (2x)
She sent for you last night, she heard you were calling
Yearning in tears a thousand times
Her spirit was floating, the spirit was searching
On a cloud of dreams
A moonbeam shines bright in the city of Angels
Guiding the dreamers back to life
They'll do the same every tomorrow
Til the pain subsides
Don't be scared now
Close your eyes
She holds guard tonight
Go on forward, no remorse
Life will take its course
Ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah ohhhh yeah ohhh
Ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah ohhhh ohhh (2x)
She danced with you last night
So you will remember
All you have shared: the lifetime
The angels were watching
And death will be waiting
Until the time is right
Don't be scared now
Close your eyes
She holds God tonight
Go on forward, no remorse
Life will take its course
Ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah ohhhh yeah ohhh
Ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah ohhhh ohhh (2x)
Hold on to memories
Still more lies ahead
Life will go on and we are one
With every step you take
Ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah ohhhh yeah ohhh
Ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah ohhhh yeah ohhhEmbed
