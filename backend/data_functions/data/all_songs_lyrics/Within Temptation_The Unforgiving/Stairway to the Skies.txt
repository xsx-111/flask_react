Stairway to the Skies Lyrics
Seven seconds to the rise
Can't believe I'm still alive
And heaven was waiting for me
I thought this would be the end
But I know you'll understand
All that is keeping me here

I dream of a stairway to the skies
My angel is coming down
From heaven to take me
I reach out but then you fade away
Whenever you call for me
Know that I'm only one step behind

My senses tell me I have changed
But one thing still remains
I'm torn and the hate still lingers
I slowly start to realize
We won't reunite
I still have to march on through

I dream of a stairway to the skies
My angel is coming down
From heaven to take me
I reach out but then you fade away
Whenever you call for me
Know that I'm only one step behind
Is it a curse or a fortune?
Have I been blinded by regret?
Redemption awaits, my soul is at stake
Will I find a stairway to the skies
In the end?

I dream of a stairway to the skies
My angel is coming down
From heaven to take me
I reach out but then you fade away
Whenever you call for me
Know that I'm only one step behind
Know that I'm only one step behind1Embed
