Iron Lyrics
Left in the darkness, here on your own
Woke up a memory, feeding the pain
You cannot deny it, there's nothing to say
It's all that you need to find the way

Oh damn, the war is coming
Oh damn, you feel you want it
Oh damn, just bring it on today

You can't live without the fire
It's the heat that makes you strong
'Cause you're born to live
And fight it all the way
You can't hide what lies inside you
It's the only thing you know
You're embracing that, never walk away
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Don't walk away, don't walk away

Raised in this madness, you're on your own
It made you fearless, nothing to lose
Dreams are a drug here, they get in your way
That's what you need to fight day by day
Oh damn, the war is coming
Oh damn, you feel you want it
Oh damn, just bring it on today

You can't live without the fire
It's the heat that makes you strong
'Cause you're born to live
And fight it all the way
You can't hide what lies inside you
It's the only thing you know
You're embracing that, never walk away
Don't walk away

You need not to fear us
Unless you're a dark heart
A vile one, who preys on the innocent
I promise
You can't hide forever even into the darkness
For we'll hunt you down like the animals you are
And pull you into the very bowels of hell

Oh damn, the war is coming
Oh damn, you feel you want it
Oh damn, just bring it on today
You can't live without the fire
It's the heat that makes you strong
'Cause you're born to live
And fight it all the way
You can't hide what lies inside you
It's the only thing you know
You're embracing that, never walk away
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Don't walk away, don't walk away1Embed
