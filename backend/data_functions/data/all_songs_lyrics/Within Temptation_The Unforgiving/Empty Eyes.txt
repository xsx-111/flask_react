Empty Eyes Lyrics
You're determined by faith
You pretend to make up
You lay out your case like the enemy
But all that you got
Through dirty white lies
You'll find the damn correct way of blaming me for your crimes

Won't you talk to me?
Don't walk or run away
I'm onto you, yesterday

With empty eyes
I don't know where I'm going
In search for answers
I don't know who I'm fighting
I stand with empty eyes
You're like a ghost within me
Who's draining my life
It's like my soul is see through
Right through my empty eyes
Right through my empty eyes

I'm about to give in, got nowhere to go
Afraid of the sins I'm holding on
There's no other way, no doubt in the end
But I ain't got a thing to lose, nothing to defend
Won't you talk to me?
Don't walk or run away
I'm onto you, yesterday

With empty eyes
I don't know where I'm going
In search for answers
I don't know who I'm fighting
I stand with empty eyes
You're like a ghost within me
Who's draining my life
It's like my soul is see through
Right through my empty eyes
Right through my empty eyes

Oh, please won't you give in to me?
Won't you finally speak truthfully?
You're determined by faith
You tend to make up
You lay out your case like the enemy
Like the enemy
With empty eyes
I don't know where I'm going
In search for answers
I don't know who I'm fighting
I stand with empty eyes
You're like a ghost within me
Who's draining my life
It's like my soul is see through
Right through my empty eyes
Right through my empty eyesEmbed
