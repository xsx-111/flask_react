Lost Lyrics
My hope is on fire
My dreams are for sale
I dance on a wire
But don't want to fail her

I walk against the strain
Fight for what I believe in
I run towards the end
Trying not to give in

She's lost in the darkness fading away
I'm still around here screaming her name
She's haunting my dreamworld trying to survive
My heart is frozen I'm losing my mind
Help me I'm buried alive!
Buried alive!

I'm burning the bridges
And there's no return
I'm trying to reach her
I feel that she yearns
I walk against the strain
Fight for what I believe in
I run towards the end
Trying not to give in

She's lost in the darkness fading away
I'm still around here screaming her name
She's haunting my dreamworld trying to survive
My heart is frozen I'm losing my mind
Help me I'm buried alive!
Buried alive!

I tried to revive what's already drowned
They think I'm a fool who can't realize
Hope plays a wicked game with the mind
Cause I thought that love would bind
I cannot revive what's already drowned
She won't come around

She's lost in the darkness fading away
I'm still around here screaming her name
She's haunting my dreamworld trying to survive
My heart is frozen I'm losing my mind
Help me I'm buried alive!
Buried alive!1Embed
