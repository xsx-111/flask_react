Murder LyricsI've been around these vicious lies too
Too long to be neglecting the truth
I'm getting closer and I'm fully armed
I'm about to hunt you down through
The big black hole right behind you
And I'm about to cut your wings away
'Cause I've been finding out
Where you've broken in
And I will take you out
When I close you in
I'm killing them all
I put my soul on the line
I purify sins that I've committed in life
I'll follow them all and I'll be bringing them down
Wherever they go I'm right behind
There's nowhere to go, your head on the line
There is no rope, you're running out of time
So where will you go when I will murder you so?
I'm about to do it your way
I will make your world unsafe
I never thought you'd get this far, it's insane
You don't believe what all the signs say
I don't believe in Judgment Day
But you won't be leaving here unharmed
Cause I've been finding out where you've broken in
And I will take you out when I close you in
I'm killing them all
I put my soul on the line
I purify sins that I've committed in life
I'll follow them all and I'll be bringing them down
Wherever they go I'm right behind
There's nowhere to go, your head on the line
There is no rope, you're running out of time
So where will you go when I will murder you so?
You can feel the pain and scream in vain
You sink away to the bottom
You can't break your chains
Break away from here
I'm killing them all
I put my soul on the line
I purify sins that I've committed in life
I'll follow them all and I'll be bringing them down
Wherever they go I'm right behind
There's nowhere to go, your head on the line
There is no rope, you're running out of time
So where will you go when I will murder you so?1Embed
