Every Day LyricsCan you light a fire in Winter's face
Or say why a life has gone to waste
Pleasure Island was an overcrowded place
Cleopatra's Needle conquered fear
One more nail in your coffin dear
Endless torture for at least two thousand years
(Every Day)
What's the use of friendship, who am I
Hell bent on destruction, how I tried
You became a ghost to me long before you diedEmbed
