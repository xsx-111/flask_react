Tigermoth LyricsJust like his old father before him
Who served in the great war would sing
We're proud to serve Kaiser or King
They'll always find someone who's willing
To take Tigermoth chances alone
The boy who should never have flown
Was thrown a hundred yards
Blown into smithereens
A crowd drew near but failed to hear
Look I'm over here and still one of you wait...
The young man's despondence soon halted
When gently a voice that he knew
Took shape slowly out of the blue
Flight Captain James at your service
Last month I went down in the drink
You're not as alone as you think
Here's some of your chums from last Thursday
Shot down in their prime over Rome
The boys who can never go home
Were thrown a hundred yards
Blown into smithereens
Until we meet again my friends
No regrets and Lily Marlene sings againEmbed
