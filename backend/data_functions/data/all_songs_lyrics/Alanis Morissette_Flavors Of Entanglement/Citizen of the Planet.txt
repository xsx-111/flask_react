Citizen of the Planet Lyrics
I start up in the north
I grow from a special seed
I sprinkle it with sensibility
From French and Hungarian snow
I linger in the sprouting
Until my engine's full

Then I move across the sea
To European bliss
To language of poets
As I cut the cord of home
I kiss my mother's mother
Look to the horizon

Wide eyed, new ground
Humbled by my new surroundings

I am a citizen of the planet
My president is Guanyin
My frontier is on an airplane
My prisons, homes for rehabilitating
Then I fly back to my nest
I fly back with my nuclear
But everything is different
So I wait
My yearn for home is broadened
Patriotism expanded
By callings from beyond

So I pack my things, nothing precious
All things sacred

I am a citizen of the planet
My laws are all of attraction
My punishments are consequences
Separating from source the original sin
I am a citizen of the planet
Democracy's kids are sovereign
Where the teachers are the sages
And pedestals filled with every parent

And so the next few years are blurry
The next decade's a flurry
Of smells and tastes unknown
Threads sewn straight through this fabric
Through fields of every color
One culture to another
And I come alive and I get giddy
And I am taken and globally naturalized

I am a citizen of the planet
From simple roots through high vision
I am guarded by the angels
And my body guides the direction I go in
I am a citizen of the planet
My favorite pastime edge stretching
Besotten with human condition
These ideals are born from my deepest within1Embed
