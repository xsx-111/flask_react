Tapes Lyrics
"I am someone easy to leave"
"Even easier to forget"
A voice, if inaccurate

Again: "I'm the one they all run from"
Diatribes of clouded sun
Someone help me find the pause button

All these tapes in my head swirl around
Keeping my vibe down
All these thoughts in my head aren't my own
Wreaking havoc

"I'm too exhausting to be loved"
"A volatile chemical"
"Best to quarantine and cut off"

All these tapes in my head swirl around
Keeping my vibe down
All these thoughts in my head aren't my own
Wreaking havoc
"I'm but a thorn in your sweet side"
"You'd be better off without me"
"It'd be best to leave at once"

All these tapes in my head swirl around
Keeping my vibe down
All these thoughts in my head aren't my own
Wreaking havocEmbed
