Giggling Again for No Reason Lyrics
I am driving in my car up highway one
I left LA without telling anyone
There were people who needed something from me
But I'm sure they’ll get along fine on their own

Oh this state of ecstasy
Nothing but road could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face
And I’m giggling again for no reason

I am dancing with my friends in elation
We’ve taken adventures to new levels of fun
I can feel the bones are smiling in my body
I can see the meltings of inhibition

Oh this state of ecstasy
Nothing but road could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face
And I’m giggling again for no reason

I’m reeling jubilation
Triumphant in delight
I'm at home in this high five
And I’m smiling for no reason
I'm sitting at the set of Cali sun
We’ve gotten quiet for its last precious seconds
I can feel the salt of the sea on my skin
And we still hear the echoes of abandon

Oh this state of ecstasy
Nothing but net could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face
And I’m giggling again for no reason1Embed
