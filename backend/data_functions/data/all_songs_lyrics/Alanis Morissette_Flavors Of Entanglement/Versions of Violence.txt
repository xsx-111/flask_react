Versions of Violence Lyrics
Coercing or leaving
Shutting down and punishing
Running from rooms, defending
Withholding, justifying

These versions of violence
Sometimes subtle, sometimes clear
And the ones that go unnoticed
Still leave their mark once disappeared

Diagnosing, analyzing
Unsolicited advice
Explaining and controlling
Judging opining and meddling

These versions of violence
Sometimes subtle, sometimes clear
And the ones that go unnoticed
Still leave their mark once disappeared

This labeling
This pointing
This sensitive's unraveling
This sting I've been ignoring
I feel it way down, way down
These versions of violence
Sometimes subtle, sometimes clear
And the ones that go unnoticed
Still leave their mark once disappeared
These versions of violence
Sometimes subtle, sometimes clear
And the ones that go unnoticed
Still leave their mark once disappearedEmbed
