Human Music LyricsI've forgotten what it's like, if I ever knew at all
I have slept on broken glass and drooped against the wall
I hung the phone up many times on angels when they rang
Their melodies were sickly sweet like overripe meringues
I was born with something missing
But I know your lip was made for kissing
Ooh baby, when that human music plays I dont know why ...
The wind explodes and rips itself to pieces everywhere
It itches in the chimney and it suffocates the air
The angels tried to anchor but they never get the chance
Their limbs are numb and twisted so they're going to have to dance
What scares you most will set you free
That's what the angel said to me, he said
Ooh baby, when that human music plays I dont know why ...
I had a girl the shape of you, I loved her with my breath
But I wouldn't want to admit that romance likes to end in death
And darkness is the shore of light, the truth is framed with lies
And a girl can smile so sweetly though her mouth is stuffed with flies
When you're thin and damp and shoddy
Just remember that you're in a body
Ooh baby, when that human music plays I dont know why ...Embed
