Leppo and the Jooves LyricsCrabwise
Over the Andalusian extensions of the life and loves of Noddy
Through the windows of disgust
The teeth of Leppo and his managers awry
No time to cry
Sunrise
A lamp of no position in the loss of all existence
To the vultures without bibles and
The preachers without leaves that pass it by
No time to sigh
All them pretty women
Planted in a row
You see them in the newspapers
But you can't have 'em -- no!
No no no no no no no no!Oh ho ho!
They get Lep-Lep-Leppo and the J-J-J-J-J-Jooves
They jump on anything that m-m-m-m-m-moves
On taxis, coffin-lids, Americans, piano-heads and roofs
Leppo...
Likewise
A farmer and his diary might conspire to freeze a widow
So I went to rob the lizard
Of his skin, his coat, his money and his earth
All that he's worth
Someday
You realize that everything you do or see or think of
If it interferes with nothing
Might as well dissolve in arrows or in tears
Nobody hears
All them famous people
Washed off in the rain
Leave not even a puddle, baby
All you leave is your name
Huh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!Your name!
I got a name, baby
It's Lep-Lep-Leppo and the J-J-J-J-J-JoovesOh ho ho!
They jump on anything that m-m-m-m-m-moves
Ah ha ha!Ah ha ha
On taxis, coffin-lids, Americans, piano-heads and roofs
Leppo...
Listen
And you can hear the dripping of the clocks, the reaping of the sun
The vengeance of the hammer and
The squeamish tight explosion of the liar
Burn in the fire
Gazing
With unforeseeing eyes into the smoke, the lungs of war
And all the endless formulations of unusable beginnings that
Have grown from hungry rivers into trees
Nobody sees
All them hungry people
They don't look so good
But I don't let it bother you
I don't see why it should
No no no no no no!Oh oh ho
Oh ho ho
Lep-Lep-Leppo and the J-J-J-J-J-Jooves
They jump on anything that m-m-m-m-m-moves
On taxis, coffin-lids, Americans, piano-heads and roofs
Leppo...Embed
