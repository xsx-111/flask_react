Cold Turkey LyricsTemperature's risin'
Fever is high
Can't see no future
Can't see no sky
My feet are so heavy
So is my head
I wish I was a junkie
I wish I was dead
Cold turkey has got me
On the run
My body is achin'
Goose pimple bone
Don't want nobody
Leave me alone
My eyes are wide open
Can't get no sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm in at the deep freeze
Cold turkey has got me
On the run
Thirty six hours
Rolling in pain
Praying to someone
To free me again
Oh, I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell
Cold turkey has got me
On the runEmbed
