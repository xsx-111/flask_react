The Pigworker LyricsWell, Crowbar Joe was one of the brotherhood
One of the brotherhood of hoods in the neighborhood
Hoods in the holiday camp, heads in the basket box
Well, J.J. Loomis had a dozen legs
He come sliding out there when you least expect him
And Crowbar Joe was a sacred pair
'Cause the one would hack as the other would loom
I'm a pigworker mama
Pigworker mama
Pigworker mama gonna work my pig on you
Pigworker mama
Pigworker mama
Pigworker mama gonna work my pig on you
So the Pterodactyl wore a hood of leather
And he opened everybody, even Heather
With her foaming roses and broken hair
She was all used upEmbed
