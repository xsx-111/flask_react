Wading Through a Ventilator LyricsI fix my fish
I fool my frog
I fray my feet, I drag my dog
I drag my dirt across the wall
I squash my dew just like my grub
I baffle adders in the pub
My girl is right
In greasy silk
A split tomato in her mind
A crumpled heart
Sagged to the sea
Tomato heart escaping gas
I think my girl has rubber skin
Of all the people that I know
The ones I like I love the best
The fishes in the sewer pipes
The highwaymen in yellow stripes
They might not now but it will be later
Wading through your ventilator
I tang my fag
You taint your cyst
The pretty Bob, he licks my stamp
And twists her fang
She tugs his foot
We think of better things and laugh
Her hair's on my marshmallow pout
My head is rich
Enough to burst
Without me struggling in my car
Fresh ale and flies
On melon halves
You wind up living somewhere cheap
And die upon a compost heap
Of all the people I don't know
The ones I do I hate the most
The twisted father of mankind
'S enough to drive a poor boy blind
It might not now but it could be later
Wading through your ventilator
I waded in and that's a fact
The meat was cut, the meat was packed
You shredded me with icy strings
As coiled salami, I was led
Into a holy stocking shed
My life, like antiseptic, stings
A tongue of stalk
And tender leaves
Eventually her skull  and  splits
And like an egg
It dribbles down your inside leg
Don't get me wrong, I'm quite okay
I drank a cat
I spun a cake
She threw transistors in my lake
I threw her head
Far through the door
You wonder what I do that for
They wonder what she think I gots
(Shut 'em down) Listen, baby
(Shut 'em down)
There ain't nothing in here but my own sweet mind
(Shut 'em down)
If it bothers you we can turn it off
(Shut 'em down)
With my antelope cheek and my raven's eye
(Shut 'em down)
And my buffalo heart and a crocodile's hide
And my salmon head weight on a moose's neck
A breathing fungus on a hemorrhaged lawn
Invented me one summer's morn
I lost you now but I'll catch you later
Wading through your ventilatorEmbed
