The Return of the Sacred Crab LyricsAnd you saw the crab on the train going home, sure you did
And you saw the crab on the train going home, sure you did
And you saw the crab in the captain's cab
In the full green jumper and the milky moves
And a horn in hand blew a fanfare sweet
And you knew my love was watching you
And you dug a hole where the moonlight fell, yes I know
And you dug a hole where the moonlight fell, yes I know
Oh, you dug a hole where the moonlight fell
And you knew the crab 'cause you knew its shell
And a twisted dog blew a hungry gut
And you knew my love was nudging you
Mmm
You need suggestions
You move as one
You tell your baby
'Let's have some fun'
Your baby's Gladys
She move like a worm
You say, 'That's alright
Baby, just don't squirm'
She keeps on moving 'til the firemen come
Then you put the firemen under your thumbs
Under your thumbs
And it blew their minds when they learned the facts, sure it did
And it blew their minds when they learned the facts, sure it did
And it blew their minds when they learned the facts
And they chased us 'round with a rubber axe
And the brainless king chewed his fingers off
And you knew my love was walking home
Walk it home, Kimberley
Don't bring it back inEmbed
