Give It to the Soft Boys LyricsFeel like asking a tree for an autograph
And I feel like making love to a photograph
Photographs don't smell

Yeah-- Give it to the Soft Boys!
Soft Boys
Well, I told you, baby, I was the only one
Then I left myself and now you're the lonely one
Machines can't jerk

Well hard boys groove and wide boys masturbate
But then soft boys wind up with a Doctor Messerschmitt
He just a-109s 'em
