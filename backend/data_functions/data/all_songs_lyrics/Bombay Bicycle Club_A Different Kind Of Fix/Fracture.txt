Fracture Lyrics
When the light's out
And all of the fracturing starts
You're just paying
For some action you lost in the dark

You come down, holding tight, to the railing on the side
You stay down, left to dry, now you're crumbling

Now your guard's down
And all of the timing has gone
You were patient
'Til earth swallowed the last of the sun

You come down, holding tight, to the railing on the side
You stay down, left to dry, now you're crumbling

It's not complex, see all of the signs flashing on
You're just paying, for all of the bad you have done3Embed
