Leave It Lyrics
Don't think it's what you're afraid of
Come in you know what's been made up
Hold you tight, words have a new sound
Reading the signs that just seep out

You've gotta leave it
Leave it, leave it, leave
You've gotta leave it
Leave it, leave it, leave

Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done

Each of your reasons has broken
Call it off once you have spoken
Fill to the top then split open
Repeating over and over

Now you have to leave it
Leave it, leave it, leave
You've gotta leave it
Leave it, leave it, leave
Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
I've been thinking lately how
All these feelings won

Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back

Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
I've been thinking lately how
All these feelings wonEmbed
