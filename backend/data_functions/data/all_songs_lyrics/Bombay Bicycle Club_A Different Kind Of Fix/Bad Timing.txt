Bad Timing Lyrics
Can I have your wayward stare?
Never mind him calling you, just keep them there

Why do you keep me back?
With all your powers I am pushing at

No never can it be
These are the words that you once said to me

Why do you keep me back?
With all your powers I am pushing at

No I'm not home enough
Then I get back and you have taken off
No never can it be
I guess I'd like to think it was bad timing
Timing, timing, timing1Embed
