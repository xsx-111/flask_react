Still Lyrics
Held your standards close to heart
But late one night you threw them down
Simple promises you said you'd never break
But now you have
All throughout the morning though
I'm begging no
Your lips they stay perfectly still

Still... still... 

Did he fill the empty spaces
Was he everything I'm not?
There's no force behind my mouth
But in just three words
He brings you down
There's a movement
Out the door
I swear but no
Your lips they stay perfectly still
