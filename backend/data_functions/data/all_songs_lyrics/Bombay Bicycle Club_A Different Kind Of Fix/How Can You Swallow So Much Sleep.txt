How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep Lyrics
Can I wake you up?
Can I wake you up?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
Is it late, is it late, is it late, is it late?

Can I wake you up?
Can I wake you up?
Is it late, is it late, is it late, is it late?
There's a story in which my eyes shut
Can I wake you up?
Can I wake you up?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?

Can I wake you up?
Can I wake you up?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?

Saw you hang back
With your eyes looking down
And it's all wasted now
Told you but you can't take it
Can I wake you up?
Can I wake you up?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?4Embed
