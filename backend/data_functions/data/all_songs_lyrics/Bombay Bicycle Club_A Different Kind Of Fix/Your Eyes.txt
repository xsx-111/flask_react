Your Eyes Lyrics
Nod my head so dumb with love
There's something else I'm dreaming of
Shut my eyes pretend it's there
Keep me here, unaware
I would promise all I could
Think about it afterward
Humour me just think it through
It's all I ever asked of you

Coming back
Coming back
Coming back
Coming back

You come out and say the word
Quick how all the tables turned
Hate that there's a space to fill
Always have and always will
I'm there when your fingers snap
It's not where we left it at
I can see the love we trapped
Coming back
Along the barren streets we slide, poke at any dirt we find
Magnify for us to see, then dig them up desperately
I would promise all I could, think about it afterward
Humour me just think it through, it's all I ever asked of you

Coming back
Coming back
Coming back
Coming back

You come out and say the word
Quick how all the tables turned
Hate that there's a space to fill
Always have and always will
I'm there when your fingers snap
It's not where we left it at
I can see the love we trapped
Coming back

Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
