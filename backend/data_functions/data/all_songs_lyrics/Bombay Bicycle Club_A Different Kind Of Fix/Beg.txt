Beg Lyrics
Feeling heart beats steal my lovers sound
When I thought my soul burnt out
Oh, I beg you come back
I beg you come back
I beg you come
Make it out of there and say you feel it now
Want you to feel it, breathe it, let it take you down
Take your time, don't throw it out

Oh, I beg you come back
I beg you come back
I beg you come
Just get out of there and say you need it now
Won't you come and pass the time?
Lay your head toward the more, she left behind
Appease my mind
So it's just this once
It's all I want

I know I'm stealing love and trading out its light
I'll find my own some time

I beg you come back
I beg you come
Just get out of there and say you needed mine
Won't you come and pass the time?
Lay your head toward the more, she left behind
Appease my mind
Let the heart decide
Come on face this side
So it's just this once
It's all I need
It's all I ever wantEmbed
