Lights Out, Words Gone Lyrics
Keep your old and wasted word
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn

Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn
Let me be the one, to go on , to go on, to go on
Let me be the one, to try it on

Can you feel the leeches bite
That boy that she took out tonight
He's brave and walking sure
Through all the spots you're working for

Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn
Let me be the one, to go on , to go on, to go on
Let me be the one, to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on6Embed
