What You Want Lyrics
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
You come down to take it on, but
You already know itâ€™s gone, and
It's oh, been this way for long and

If I gotta ride like you want
Eating up whatever you got
Keeping my lies up, you know
Oh you force it all, oh you need it all

Trying to keep a face up tonight
Even when the guy's got you right
Coming off the wrong side, you know
Oh you force it all

You start it right, you tread so light
You tease this love, you care enough
You can rearrange me now
If we wait we can make it somehow
What you want, what you want
Anything you want

You start it right, you tread so light
You tease this love, you care enough
You start it right, you tread so light
You tease this love, you care enough
You start it right, you tread so light
You tease this love, you care enough1Embed
