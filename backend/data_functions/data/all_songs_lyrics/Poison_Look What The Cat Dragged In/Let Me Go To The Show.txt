Let Me Go To The Show LyricsMama, please let me go to the show
I dig those bad boys playing that rock and roll
No way, son, you can't go out tonight
So I got real upset, put up the biggest fight
Mama, let me go to the show
I dig those bad boys playing that rock and roll
Mama, let me go out tonight
Mama, please, before I lose my mind
Out the window
Shimmy down the tree
I take a look around
Make sure no one's watching me
I steal the keys and take
My old man's Chevrolet
I can hear my Mama scream
From ten miles away
Mama, let me go to the show
I dig those bad boys playing that rock and roll
Mama, let me go out tonight
Mama, please, before I lose my mind, yeah
Rock and roll rodeo
Rock and roll rodeo
Mama, let me go to the show
I dig those bad boys playing that rock and roll
Mama, let me go out tonight
Mama, please, before I lose my mindEmbed
