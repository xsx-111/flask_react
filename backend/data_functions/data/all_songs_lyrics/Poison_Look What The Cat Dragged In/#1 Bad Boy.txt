#1 Bad Boy LyricsWhat you heard about me
Was probably right
I'm the boy next door
The one you were warned about
Oh yes, indeed
Well, I'm no upstanding citizen
But I'm standing up
Just the same
Number one bad boy
Who's to blame
Number one bad boy
Ain't that a shame
Yeah, right
All my friends are two faced
And I'm a social disgrace
I got no morals
Don't belong in the rat race
Well, I'm no upstanding citizen
But I'm standing up
Just the same
Number one bad boy
The one you were warned about
Number one bad boy
Go ahead honey
Kick me out
Into a lonely world
Where I'm lost without a trace
Two faced
Rat race
Disgrace
Will I stand up on my own?
Will I fall on my face?
Will I stand up on my own?
Will I fall on my face?
Look out, wow!
What you heard about me
Was probably right
I'm the boy next door
The one you were warned about
Oh yes, indeed
Well, I'm no upstanding citizen
But I'm standing up
Just the same
Number one bad boy
Who's to blame
Number one bad boy
Ain't that a shame
Yeah, right
Number one bad boy
The one you were warned about
Number one bad boy
Go ahead honey
Kick me out
Number one
Number one
Number one
Bad bad boy
Number one
Number one
Number one
Bad bad boy
Number one
Number one
Number one
Bad bad boy
