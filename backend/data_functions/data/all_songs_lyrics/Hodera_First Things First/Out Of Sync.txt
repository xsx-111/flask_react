Out Of Sync LyricsWoke up at 11 and I'm trapped in my head
Today’s not important so I'm staying in bed
There's nothing too wrong with my existence
So why does it still feel like there's something missing?
I think of the moments that I've shared with my friends
Emotions so potent thought that they’d never end
I know I can't be always that happy
I'm just looking for balance
That's all that I need
An apartment in Montclair with some people I know
A mattress, a notebook, a room with a window
A job I don’t hate, friends that don't act fake
Five bucks in my pocket to get into the show
In this dream that I had I was already dead
Floating over my grave, on my tombstone it read
Only the dates, that’s all that it said
And no one was there, but my pastor and dad
No, I can’t end like that I’m better than that
Shit will work out
I know that it can
I’m trying to believe
I want to believe
That one day I’ll be better
But the pressure won’t ease
And I’m fucking angry
I want to be a better version of me
Cause I’m kind of selfish and my will powers weak
I’ve felt what it’s like to become that guy
But it feels like I’m fated to fall out of syncEmbed
