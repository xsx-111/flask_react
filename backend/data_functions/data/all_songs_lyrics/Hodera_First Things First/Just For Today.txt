Just For Today LyricsI try and picture the moment he took his last breath
All alone in his room did he welcome in death
When the morning came and his mother found him that way
I hope I never know what it’s like to feel that pain
At 43 my friends uncle just died in his sleep
His wife woke up to his body whiter than the sheets
His son ran in, started pumping his chest
The EMTs brought in a body bag
His wife just screamed “is he dead? is he dead?”
It gets harder to come back each time
At this point I will thrive or die
I need to find some peace of mind
So I rub my eyes and read the signs this time
I can’t do it on my own
So I grab the phone
And call who’ll ever
Answers never hold their own
Just when I think I know it turns out that I’m wrong
So I tell myself “just for today, I’ll be stronger than my demons”
When I know that they won’t go away
They will die with me or bury me
Every time it ends the same
I never change
The same book different pages all in front of me
My history just patterns on repeat
So I tell myself “just for today, I’ll be stronger than my demons”
When I know that they won’t go away
They will die with me or bury me
I tell myself “just for today”Embed
