Best Intentions LyricsGot bored in your bedroom so we went for a drive
To the lake where I grew up, it was almost midnight
Stole a boat and rowed out, watched the moon eclipse go by
And the water below us was as deep as the love that kept us floating there
But this boat’s sinking slowly now that you’re gone
I guess we’ll just stop talking then
We can forget this ever happened
‘Cause it’s obvious I can’t just be your friend
I’m going in circles ‘cause I only have one paddle out here alone
Got back to shore ‘bout 2AM
I grabbed your jacket on the boat dock
And I pulled you in and we kissed
It was so dark, I found your lips
Only because I felt your breath
I know that soon I will be fine
You left this void the size of pines lake
Now I’m filling it up one cup at a time
And if I knew that was the last time I’d see you
I might have said
Hey Mary, that was one crazy summer
I know after this we’ll never see each other
I’m old enough now to know nothing lasts forever
The only thing I ask is please
Remember every detail of this moment
Because once you close that door you’ll never see me
And some day you might remember
When we drove out to the lake
And stole a boat to see the moon eclipse go by
And when you think of this, I just want you to picture
Both my eyes looking intently
Hear my words as free verse poetry
Feel my hands painting your body
Don’t regret you ever met me
‘Cause I know you couldn’t love me
But if I must be a memory  won’t you frame me in a way
That you will smile when you’re picturing my face
And then I promise I won’t  call you like I did
When I was  drunk in Austin, Texas
Swear I had the best intentions
I won’t call you like I did when I was Drunk in Austin, Texas
And I let out all my demons
Swear I had the best intentionsEmbed
