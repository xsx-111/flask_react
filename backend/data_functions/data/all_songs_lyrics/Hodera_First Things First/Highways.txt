Highways LyricsHighways, these days, feel like home
Cause standing stagnant feels so wrong
Where do I belong?
I don’t know
Where do I belong?
When the voices in my head begin to collide
Blue Ridge Mountains I found grace
And I wish I could always feel that way
Where do I belong?
I don’t know
Where do I belong?
When the voices in my head begin to collide
Where do I belong?
I don’t know
Where do I belong?
Oh, where do I belong?
I don’t knowEmbed
