North Dakota LyricsI had a dream I was in North Dakota laying in a field
Where they had grown a bunch of corn, but then they cut it down
So now it’s just a place where I can lay and pretend everything’s okay
Because in this dream you were there next to me engaging in the silence
I know there was a time when I was always on your mind
But now you just seem too preoccupied, I’m strung out on a line
But I remember in November when we met in Connor’s cellar at a show
We liked each other’s sweaters so we traded for awhile
I can feel it in my gut that you no longer give a fuck
It’s like that corner of the parking lot that's desolate and filled with all the snow from this past winter, now it’s April and it’s still there
And it’s melting so damn slow it’ll probably make it through the Summer
I was younger when my mother told my sister and my brother and me
If we cleaned our rooms then she would take us to get ice cream
But I shoved all of my clothes under my bed and she pretended not to see
And I can tell that you can tell that there is something wrong with me
Is there something wrong with me?
But I don't want to do this alone
I don't want to do this alone
I don't want to do this alone
I don't want to do this alone
I mailed you out some letters and some books that I had read
But then the next week when you got them you just texted me and said "That you appreciate it so much"
I said “call me and let’s catch up”
But I guess you’re just too busy, think that I’m getting the message
When I woke I was still dreaming ‘bout the field where we were laying in my head
Wish that I could tell you, but I can't so I went back to bed
Oh never lasting, always fleeting are the moments that we shared
I can’t control it but you’re love is something I wish I still had
So I went back to bed
But I don't want to do this alone
I don't want to do this alone
I don't want to do this alone
I don't want to do this alone2Embed
