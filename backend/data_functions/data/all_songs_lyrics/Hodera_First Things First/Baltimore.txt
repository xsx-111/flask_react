Baltimore LyricsI’ve run out of people I can tell about
When we made out on the couch at that guy’s house
And though I doubt that anyone could help me now
I still can’t calm down
Cause that one night that we spent in Baltimore
It was so nice but then you left me wanting more
And the sunrise the next morning in your eyes
Made me think that this was more
But black ice, I didn't notice it was there
Yea sometimes things are not as they appear
And that's not your fault I know the guidelines weren't clear
But now you’re fine and I'm just trying my best to steer
I don't want to believe when we’re older that you won't remember my name anymore
And I don't want to believe this is over so I send my heart to Baltimore
I wonder what you’re doing in this moment
You’re sister she told my friend that you found love
Well that's not fair
When I was laying in your bed and stroking your hair
Did you wish that he was there?
Oh your kiss, it’s like a blanket made of wool
And though it’s so warm, it’s too small
My feet are cold, Yea I need more
A call back would help for sure
You’re so distant
It’s like we’ve never met before
I don't want to believe when we’re older that you won't remember my name anymore
And I don't want to believe this is over so I send my heart to Baltimore
And I don’t want to believe when we’re sober that the love we found ran out the night before
And I don't want to believe this is over so I send my heart to BaltimoreEmbed
