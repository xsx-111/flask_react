My Daily Chemicals LyricsWish I could move to Montclair in an apartment maybe off Walnut Street
Where the coffee is as quality as the people I meet
I could live amongst my past and my memories
They said I had such promise when I was 14
In western Kansas the great plains reach up and touch the horizon Though it feels lonelier than a circular desert island
And my chest felt so empty like the dead field was a part of me
And I still feel it now so vividly
So I take my daily chemicals with water from the sink
And I cut out all the variables that push me to the brink
Off the coast of Mexico there’s a man who made an island from plastic bottles
Saw him on television, he smiled as he rebutted
And he talked about the life that he once knew and I wish that I could do that too
Move away and start anew
And there’s a metronome that’s embedded in the back of my head
It reminds me to move faster because my time is limited
And if I lose pace and start to space or go insane
And then a part of me’s erased
Where is my place?
So I take my daily chemicals with water from the sink
And I cut out all the variables that push me to the brinkEmbed
