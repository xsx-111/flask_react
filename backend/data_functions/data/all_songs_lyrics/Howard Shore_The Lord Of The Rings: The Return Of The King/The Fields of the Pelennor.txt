The Fields of the Pelennor LyricsEdrochant e Forth he rode
Na nagor, In to battle
Ed nan gurth. Forth in to death
A e gladhant And he laughed
An e naun ad neth For he was young again
A naun aran And he was King
Hir gwaith beleg. The Lord of a great people
Elo! And lo!
Sui orthant vegil ín Even as raised his sword
Vi ‘las beleg In great joy
Ortholl gurth. Death came on
Anann si lostar Long now they sleep
Nu lae vi Ngondor Under grass in Gondor
Sí lostar na hír veleg Sleep now by the great river
Mithren sui nîr, thiliol celebren Grey as tears, gleaming silver
Ta geliant caran, Red then it rolled
Púrinnen na hereg Dyed with their blood
Lachant ned annûn Flamed at sunset;
Úrianner i eryd The mountains burned;
Sui ros garan dannant As red dew fell
Or pheli Pelennor On the fields of PelennorEmbed
