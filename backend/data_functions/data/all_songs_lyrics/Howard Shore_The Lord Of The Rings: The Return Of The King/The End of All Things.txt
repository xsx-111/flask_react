The End of All Things Lyrics
Mi naurath Orodruin
Boe hedi i Vin
Han i vangad i moe ben bango
Sin eriol natha tur in ugarnen
Sin eriol um beleg ugannen
U cilith 'war
U men 'war
Boe vin mebi
Boe vin bango
Into the fires of Orodruin
The One must be cast
This  the price that must be paid
Only thus its power will be undone
Only thus a great evil unmade
There is no other choice
There is no other way
One of you must take it
One of you must pay

Dannen le
A u-erin le regi
Rang ail le iestannen
Lu ail le tegin na hen
Gwannach o innen ului
U lu erui, ului
You have fallen
And I cannot reach you
Ever step I willed you on
Every moment I lead you to this
You never left my mind
Not once, not ever

Anirach unad
Egor gurth hen
Han cenin vi chen lin
Egor u-erin le devi
Tellin men achae
Brennin men anann
Rago! U-erich leithio
U-erich o nin gwanno
You want nothing more
Than this death
I see it in your eye
But I cannot let you
We have come too far
We have held on too long
Reach! You cannot let go
You cannot leave me
Nu dalav
Urui tuiannen na ruith
Leithia Orodruin oe in phan
Ristannen i geven
Danna eliad morn
Si, na vethed
Meth i naid bain
I wilith uria
I ardhon ban lacha!
Beneath the ground
Swollen hot with anger
Orodruin releases all its ruin
Earth rips asunder
Black rain falls
Here at the end;
The end of all things
The air is aflame
All the world is on fire!

Orthannen im vi ol
Coll e du
Or hiriath naur
Na rovail mae sui 'waew
Man prestant i ardhon?
Cerithar aen illiad dim uthenin?
In a dream I was lifted up
Borne from the darkness
Above the rivers of fire
On wings daft as the wind
What's happened to the world?
Is everything sad going to come untrue?Embed
