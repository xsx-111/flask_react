Unbreakable Lyrics
By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march
Then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him

It's under crimson skies, hell's horizon
Our trap will spring
Unaware of our presence, they'll be marching
Straight to their doom

We are prepared for war, ready for fire
Stand by to charge
Counting down as they march into destruction
Their time has come

They'll never know, we give no warning
We set a trap, they took the bait
Leading them straight into hell

They will not live to tell the tale
We'll strike at dusk and fight 'till dawn
Tonight our foe is bound to fail
Our time is now, all ready at arms
Upon our chosen ground, dead men marching
No sign of hope
Victory will be ours before the dawn breaks
Tonight we charge

They'll never know, we give no warning
We set a trap, they took the bait
Leading them straight into hell

They will not live to tell the tale
We'll strike at dusk and fight 'till dawn
Tonight our foe is bound to fail
Our time is now, all ready at arms


Chaos and disorder, sound of the attack
Charging down the mountain, frontal assault
Guns light up the darkness, mortars rip the ground
Like a force of nature shaking the field

They never knew, we gave no warning
We set a trap, they took the bait
Cut off retreat
Release - unleash
The beast within
Berserker rage is
Released - unleashed
A storm, a force, unbreakable war machine


Victims of the ambush stains the ground with blood
Fields of execution, murderous plan
Soldiers turn to madmen in the dead of night
Fighting with a fury, fiery eyes

They never knew, we gave no warning
We set a trap, they took the bait
Cut off retreat

Release - unleash
The beast within
Berserker rage is
Released - unleashed
A storm, a force, unbreakable war machine
Unleash the beast within
Berserker rage is released4Embed
