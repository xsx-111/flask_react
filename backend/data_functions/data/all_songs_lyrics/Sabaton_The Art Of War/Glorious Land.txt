Glorious Land LyricsEndless waste
Our patience runs thin
Here we stand ready
Let the battle begin!
Hit back! Charge!
As the forces arrive
Shove! Go! Push!
Leave no foes left alive!

Facing the storm, battered and torn
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!
Darkness falls
And the screams fade away
Home of the fallen
And the home of the brave!

Facing the storm, battered and torn
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!
Facing the storm, battered and torn
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!

Facing the storm, battered and torn
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!1Embed
