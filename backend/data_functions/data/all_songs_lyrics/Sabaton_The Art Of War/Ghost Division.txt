Ghost Division LyricsFast as the wind the invasion has begun
Shaking the ground with the force of thousand guns
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Leading the way
Charging the lines with the force of a furious storm
Fast as the lightning phantoms swarm
200 miles at nightfall
Taking within a day
Thus earning the name, earning the fame

They are the
Panzer elite
Born to compete
Never retreat
Ghost Division
Living or dead
Always ahead
Fed by your dread
Always ahead as the blitzkrieg rages on
Breaking morale with the sound of blazing guns
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Leading the way
Leaving a trail of destruction through a foreign land
(Waging war with conviction)
Massive assault live to serve the nazi plan
(Wehrmachts pride, ghost division)
Communications broken
Phantoms too far away
Thus earning the name, earning the fame

They are the
Panzer elite
Born to compete
Never retreat
Ghost Division
Living or dead
Always ahead
Fed by your dread
Pushing the frontline forth with a tremendous force
(Far ahead, breaks resistance)
Breaching the way for panzer corps
(Show no fear, self-subsistent)
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, claiming the fame

They are the
Panzer elite
Born to compete
Never retreat
Ghost Division
Living or dead
Always ahead
Fed by your dread
Panzer elite
Born to compete
Never retreat
Ghost Division
Living or dead
Always ahead
Fed by your dread8Embed
