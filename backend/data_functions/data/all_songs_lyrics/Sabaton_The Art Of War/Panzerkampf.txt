Panzerkampf LyricsInto the Motherland the German army march!

In the Soviet Union, Summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands, as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught, ready for the fight
Waiting for the Axis, to march into the trap
Mines are placed in darkness in the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered when the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle's started there's no turning back

The end of the Third Reich draws near
Its time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack

Into the Motherland the German Army march!
Comrades, stand side by side, to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil, a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed

Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, the tide of war has turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the frontline, force the Axis to retreat
Send in all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union broke the Citadel
"Ruins of an Army Axis rest in hell"
The end of the Third Reich draws near
Its time has come to an end
The end of an era is near
It's time to attack

Into the Motherland the German Army march!
Comrades, stand side by side, to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil, a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Onward Comrades! Armies of the Soviet Union, Charge!

Oh, Mother Russia, union of lands
Will of the people, strong in command
Oh, Mother Russia, union of lands
Once more victorious, the Red Army stands


The end of the Third Reich draws near
Its time has come to an end
The end of an era is near
It's time to attack
Into the Motherland the German Army march!
Comrades, stand side by side, to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil, a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed22Embed
