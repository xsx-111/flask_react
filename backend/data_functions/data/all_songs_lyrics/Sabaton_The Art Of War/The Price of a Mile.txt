The Price of a Mile Lyrics
Throw your soldiers into positions
Once there is no escape
And they will prefer death to flight

Hear the sound of the machine gun
Hear it echo in the night
Mortars firing, rains the scene
Scars the fields that once were green
It's a stalemate at the front line
Where the soldiers rest in mud
Roads and houses, all is gone
There's no glory to be won
Know that many men will suffer
Know that many men will die
Half a million lives at stake
Ask the fields of Passchendaele
And as night falls the general calls
And the battle carries on and on
What is the purpose of it all?
What's the price of a mile?

Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young mens lives
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army in despair
Knee-deep in mud
Stuck in the trench with no way out
Thousands of machine guns
Kept on firing through the night
Mortars placed and wreck the scene
Guns the fields that once were green
Still a deadlock at the front line
Where the soldiers die in mud
Roads and houses since long gone
Still no glory has been won
Know that many men has suffered
Know that many men has died
Six miles of ground has been won
Half a million men are gone
And as the men crawled the general called
And the killing carried on and on
What was the purpose of it all?
What's the price of a mile?

Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young mens lives
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army in despair
Knee-deep in mud
Stuck in the trench with no way out
Young men are dying
They pay the price
Oh how they suffer
So tell me, what's the price of a mile?
That's the price of a mile!

Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young mens lives
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army in despair
Knee-deep in mud
Stuck in the trench with no way out
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young mens lives
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army in despair
Knee-deep in mud
Stuck in the trench with no way out
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young mens lives
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army in despair
Knee-deep in mud
Stuck in the trench with no way out
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young mens lives
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army in despair
Knee-deep in mud
Stuck in the trench with no way out
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young mens lives7Embed
