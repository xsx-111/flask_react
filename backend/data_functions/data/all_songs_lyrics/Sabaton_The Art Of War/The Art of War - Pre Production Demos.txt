The Art of War - Pre Production Demos Lyrics"If you know the enemy and know yourself
You need not fear the result of a hundred battles
If you know yourself but not the enemy
For every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat
If you know neither the enemy nor yourself
You will succumb in every battle"
I stand alone and gaze upon the battlefield
You are my targets, yes, you are the prey
I call in fire, exterminate your armies, that's the truth
Dream on
You are the hunter, you're the pain
And I see in your eyes, thousands die
Thousands fight, reinvent you
Hear my call from the dead
Face your fears, resurrect
I will win but never fight
That's the Art of War! 
I stand alone and gaze upon the battlefield
You are my targets, yes, you are the prey
I call in fire, exterminate your armies, that's the truth
Dream on
You are the hunter, you're the pain
And I see in your eyes, thousands die
Thousands fight, reinvent you
Hear my call from the dead
Face your fears, resurrect
I will win but never fight
That's the Art of War! 
Enter the night
King of the kings
You are fated for more
Into the light
I am the one
Light falling again
And I see in your eyes, thousands die
Thousands fight, reinvent you
Hear my call from the dead
Face your fears, resurrect
I will win but never fight
That's the Art of War! 1Embed
