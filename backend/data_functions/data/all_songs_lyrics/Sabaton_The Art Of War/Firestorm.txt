Firestorm Lyrics
But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being
Nor can the dead ever be brought back to life

Warnings of an airstrike
The sirens scream out loud
Warning on the radio
Of what's coming
Appearing on the radar
A threat from overseas
Planes on the horizon
Cast shadows on the ground

Bringers of destruction
Are ravaging the land
Fury of the bombers
A force to reckon with
Sets the world on fire
Then turns to strike again
Flames are burning higher
The bombs keep falling

AA guns are blazing
As the sky is turning red
Better run for cover, you'll be quick or be dead
Burn! Burn!
Rage of the heavens
Burn! Burn!
Death from above
Die! Die!
Merciless killing
Burn! Burn!
Death from above

Carpet-bombing cities
And grinding them to dust
Able men and women
Will all be victims
Everyone will suffer
In the wake of their attack
Bombers show no mercy
A land in ruin

Homes are turned to rubble
When the airstrike has been approved
Facing their destruction
Fear the black wings of death
Burn! Burn!
Rage of the heavens
Burn! Burn!
Death from above
Die! Die!
Merciless killing
Burn! Burn!

Nothing remains
Cities ruined, turned to dust
All has been lost
Rise from the ashes and strike

AA guns are blazing
As the sky is turning red
Better run for cover, you'll be quick or be dead

Burn! Burn!
Rage of the heavens
Burn! Burn!
Death from above
Die! Die!
Merciless killing
Burn! Burn!
Death from above1Embed
