Swedish Pagans Lyrics
Wo, ho, ho

The wise woman said
'Once you're hardened in battle, there's no coming back'
Fight or fall
And before the attack
Feel your blood starts to boil
In your veins as you charge
Hundreds fallen

As the fire inside is ignited by bloodshed
In berserkers from north
Could it be as was said
When the serpent be woken
Fenrir howls

Swedish pagans, marching a shore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgard, our viking ship sails
Never to turn back again

Wo, ho, ho
Where brothers have past is where we'll be proven
The ground they begun
Standing tall
And we know if we fall, our comrades awaits in Valhall'
Odin's calling

As the fire inside, is ignited by bloodshed
In berserkers from North
Will it be as was said, will the serpents be woken
Fenrir howls

Swedish pagans, marching a shore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgard, our viking ship sails
Never to turn back again

First to the battle, first to the feast
Destiny waiting, no retreat, retreat

Swedish pagans, marching a shore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgard, our viking ship sails
Never to turn back again
Wo, ho, ho1Embed
