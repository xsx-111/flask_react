Union (Slopes of St. Benedict) LyricsRegard your soldiers as your children and they will follow you
Into the deepest battles. Look upon them as your own beloved sons
And they will stand by you, even until death
As a turn of the tide it is our turn to rise
The force of a union at war
March over mountains on our way to the north
On the road that will lead us to Rome
Our way will not be easy
It will take us through hardship and pain
Hill after hill breaking their lines of defence
Head on north
Mile after mile our march carries on
No army may stop our approach
Fight side by side many nations unite
In the shadow of Monte Cassino
We fight and die together
As we head for the valley of death
Destiny calls, we'll not surrender or fail
To arms, under one banner
As a unit we stand and united we fall
As one, fighting together
Bringing an end to the slaughter
Winds are changing, head on north
Head on north
Head on north
Times are changing
Head on north
To arms, under one banner
As a unit we stand and united we fall
As one, fighting together
Bringing an end to the slaughter
Winds are changing, head on north1Embed
