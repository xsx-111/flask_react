DJ LyricsShe's heading for the High Street
They end up in a club instead
She wants to take a back seat
The tunes get inside her head
He said "It's just the music, baby
Don't matter if we stay out late"
Her eyes are so tired and heavy
She hears the last song of the night
Hear a sound
Turn around
It's only your breathing
And it's clear in the air
Like the stars in the sky
Hear a sound
Turn around
It's only your breathing
Hold me tight
Just hold me tight
Close your eyes to the DJ
Close your eyes and fade away
Making out to the DJ
Making out to the DJ
She wakes up in the morning
The tune's still inside her head
He said he'd call on Saturday
And take her to the club again
As she moves a little closer to kiss him
She only feels the cold night air
He's never gonna keep his promise
She's never gonna see him again
Hear a sound
Turn around
It's only your breathing
And it's clear in the air
Like the stars in the sky
Hear a sound
Turn around
It's only your breathing
Hold me tight
Just hold me tight
Close your eyes to the DJ
Close your eyes and fade away
Making out to the DJ
Making out to the DJ
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Whenever she hears that sound
She turns around
He's not around
The music she knows so well
Will save her now
Save her now
Hear a sound
Turn around
It's only your breathing
And it's clear in the air
Like the stars in the sky
Hear a sound
Turn around
It's only your breathing
Hold me tight
Just hold me tight
Close your eyes to the DJ
Close your eyes and fade away
Making out to the DJ
Making out to the DJ
Fade away
Fade away
Fade away
Fade awayEmbed
