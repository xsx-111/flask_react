When I Was Seventeen LyricsWhen I was seventeen
My heart and head were full of brilliant dreams
Assembled in the light of a day
That seems so far away
Away
And now
When I was seventeen
When I was seventeen
I thought we knew everything
We knew everything
No responsibility
Endless possibility
What on Earth could possibly hurt me?
Lubetkin
Corbusier
Van der Rohe
Mendelsohn
Modern, modern
Brutalist architecture
Future, future
The future is clean and modern
Space and light and dreams
That's all people need
And a place to sleep
The music and the songs
That you play
Sound so far away
Away (away)
And now
When I was seventeen
When I was seventeen
I thought we knew everything
We knew everything
When I was seventeen
I thought we knew everything
When I was seventeen
When I was seventeen
When I was seventeen
When I was seventeen
I was seventeenEmbed
