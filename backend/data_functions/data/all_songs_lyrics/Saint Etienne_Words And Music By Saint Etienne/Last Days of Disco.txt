Last Days of Disco LyricsWe just gotta go where it takes us
Let nothing, nothing come, come between us
Feel the magic in the cold night air
Let the music catch us unaware
We just gotta go where it takes us
Any day we could vanish in a cloud of dust
Inhibition, don't get in the way
'Cause tomorrow is another day
Let's dance
Cut a rug together
And now I know you better
It's the way that I want it to be
Let's dance
Cut a rug together
Looking at forever
It's the way that I want it to be
We just gotta move with the right time
All I know is I would risk it all to make you mine
Won't you tell me if you're out of reach
Just the thought of you it leaves me weak
Let's dance
Cut a rug together
And now I know you better
It's the way that I want it to be
Let's dance
Cut a rug together
Looking at forever
It's the way that I want it to be
Waking up and feeling down
Meet some friends in Chinatown
Tell me if I'm moving too fast
Donna says it's time to go
Catch a late night picture show
Let's make this moment last
Yeah
Let's dance
Cut a rug together
And now I know you better
It's the way that I want it to be
Let's dance
Cut a rug together
Looking at forever
It's the way that I want it to be
Let's dance
Let's dance
It's the way that I want it to be
Let's dance
Let's dance
It's the way that I want it to beEmbed
