Heading for the Fair LyricsLights
I see them far away
There's so many lights
The colours and the voices drift my way
I see you once again
It's been a long, long year
But I believe we haven't changed since then
I'll maybe hold your hand
And then spin me round again
The way you have so often in my dreams
My mama said don't go
There's nothing for you there
I stroll across the road
I'm heading for the fair
The music, endless sound
Of candy floss and love (love, love, love, love, love)
Please don't go
The sin, the darkness, baby, I know
He'll say that it's forever (love, love, love)
And he'll be back
So he can be with you
Round and round I'm spinning
Softly velvet touch my cheek
I think of you
Tried to catch your eye in vain
I'm giving out
You're spinning out of view
I see you once again
It's been a long, long year
But I believe we haven't changed since then
My mama said don't go
There's nothing for you there
I stroll across the road
I'm heading for the fair
The music endless sound
Of candy floss and love (love, love, love, love, love)
Please don't go
The sin, the darkness baby I know
He'll say that it's forever
And he'll be back
So he can be with you
Round and round I'm spinning
Softly velvet touch my cheek
I think of you
Tried to catch your eye in vain
I'm giving out
You're spinning out of view
Round and round I'm spinning
Softly velvet touch my cheek
I think of you
Watch you walk away in vain
I'm giving out
You're spinning out of viewEmbed
