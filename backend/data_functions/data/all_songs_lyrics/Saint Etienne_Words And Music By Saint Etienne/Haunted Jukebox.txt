Haunted Jukebox LyricsGhosts
Of an ancient song
Seem to hide in many places
Bringing back so many faces
And I
Know that it's been too long
But the spirits in the air
It's like the tunes are everywhere
I wanna go
I can't escape
I'm sure you know
They leave me haunted
I was just 15
In November '82
When I would meet you after school
And there was bonfires on Halloween
Frosty little windows
All the songs we used to listen to each time
Hands in gloves and yours in mine
Going round and round my mind
They leave me haunted
One night in Allentown
When you called me on the phone
And told me you were coming over
Fine 45s you found
Now every time I hear them
Knowing you're not near and won't be soon
It goes much further in our tune
When every record in the room
They leave me haunted
Haunted
Haunted
Haunted
She said
Sometimes it makes me wanna die
Sometimes it makes me scream and shout
And when the record's over
Just tell me what it's all about
Sometimes it makes me wanna die
Sometimes it makes me scream and shout
And when the record's over
Just tell me what it's all about
Haunted
Haunted
Haunted
Haunted
Haunted
Haunted
Haunted
Haunted
