Twenty Five Years LyricsI got twenty-five years
Maybe more if I'm lucky
I know I've been pretty dumb
And I spent all my money
I gotta make it new
I gotta make it new for you
There's twenty-five years
To work out where we're going
I know summer's almost over
So before it starts snowing
I gotta make it new
I gotta make it new for you
I gotta make it new for you
For you
You never tried to mend my ways
No, no, even in my troublesome days
I used to say I'd never wed
Baby, those were foolish things that I said
Night time
Drip, drip, drip goes the rain on the window
Nowhere I would rather be when your head's on my pillow
We gotta make it new
I gotta make it new for you
I gotta make it new for you
For youEmbed
