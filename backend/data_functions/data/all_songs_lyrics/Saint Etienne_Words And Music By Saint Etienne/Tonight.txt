Tonight LyricsCheck my make-up and check my watch again
I can hardly wait
Play the album and play it all again
I can hardly wait
They say the music press is set to try us
They say that they're in love with synthesizers
And baby don't you know there'll be surprises
Tonight
Tonight
This could be my life this could save my life
I can hardly wait
Maybe they'll open with an album track
Or a top five hit no turning back
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Maybe they'll open with an album track
Or a top five hit no turning back
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Tonight when the lights are going down
I will surrender to the sound
And look at all the kids around
Tonight the sound is breaking like a wave
Wish it could always feel this way
And life will never be the same
Check my make-up and check my watch again
I can hardly wait
There's a part of me only they can see
I can hardly wait
Maybe they'll open with an album track
Or a top five hit no turning back
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Maybe they'll open with an album track
Or a top five hit no turning back
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Tonight when the lights are going down
I will surrender to the sound
And look at all the kids around
Tonight the sound is breaking like a wave
Wish it could always feel this way
And life will never be the same
It's been too long
It's been too long
Maybe they'll open with an album track
Or a top five hit no turning back
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Maybe they'll open with an album track
Or a top five hit no turning back
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-oh ooh
Tonight when the lights are going down
I will surrender to the sound
And look at all the kids around
Tonight the sound is breaking like a wave
Wish it could always feel this way
And life will never be the sameEmbed
