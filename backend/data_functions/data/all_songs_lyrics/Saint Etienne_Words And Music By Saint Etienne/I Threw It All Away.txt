I Threw It All Away LyricsIs there a part of you
Wondering
Where did the whole thing go wrong?
And is there a part of you
Worrying
What if my reason to smile
Is gone?
Right now I don't know
What to say
But I'm thinking ahead
Everything has to change
But it still feels like
I threw it all away
And now I'm gonna pay
Forever
Whatever
I do or say
Are you missing me?
Does it come back to you
Late at night?
Do you remember those days
Down on the avenue
Baltimore
Watching the rain chase away
The sun?
But now I don't know
What to do
I'm all out of ideas
Everything has to change
But it still feels like
I threw it all away
And now I've gotta pay
Forever
Whatever I do or say
Are you missing me?
So life will move along
But love will linger
Love will linger on
Yes, I gotta pay
Forever
Whatever
I do or sayEmbed
