Manhattan LyricsI tip to Bengal
Tip to Somal
I tip to Burmese
Tip Kenyanese
See, see them sliding through the sun
See, see them sliding through the sun
Through the sun
I tip Havanian
Abyssinian
Here Alaskan
Here Corsican
See, see them sliding through the sun
See, see them sliding through the sun
Through the sun
Scalper in the lampglow
Scalper on a chair
Fleur de Lis
The rest is connected
Chief of police
The phone's disconnected
And here you are boy
Here you are
Here you are boy
Here you are
Here you are boy
Here you are
I tip to Bengal
No he tips to Bengal
Tips to Somal
Hey, Hey Nasser
Tips to Burmese
Tips Kenyanese
See, see them sliding through the sun
See, see them sliding through the sun
Scalper in the lampglow
Scalper everywhere
Stiff white shirt
And his arms don't work
Say Fleur de Lis
The rest is connected
Chief of police
The phone's disconnected
And here you are boy
Here you are
Here you are boy
Here you are
Here you are boy
Here you are
He tips Havanian
Yips Abyssinian
Here Alaskan
Hey Corsican
We tip to Russo
On me all my life
See him sliding through the sun
On me all my life
See him sliding through the sunEmbed
