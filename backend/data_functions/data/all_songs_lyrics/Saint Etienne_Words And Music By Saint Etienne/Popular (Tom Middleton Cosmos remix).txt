Popular (Tom Middleton Cosmos remix) LyricsA while back
I was very low
When this guy
Said I had to go
Oh, boy
You broke my heart in two
Then I found
Some people having fun
Talking ill
And juking number ones
Come down
I don't mind if I do
All I wanna talk about is "Touch Me, Touch Me"
All I wanna hear about is "Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me"
One time, two time, three time and again
And again
And again
And again
All I wanna talk about is "Touch Me, Touch Me"
All I wanna hear about is "Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me"
One time, two time, three time and again
And again
And again
And again
There's Tim, Mason & Taylor man
Here's Kat, Mark and Pete Baran
And meet Tom
The nabob of the scene
There's Cis
Down from Oxford Way
And here's me
With such a lot to say
Baby, jump into my dreams
All I wanna talk about is "Touch Me, Touch Me"
All I wanna hear about is "Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me"
One time, two time, three time and again
And again
And again
And again
All I wanna talk about is "Touch Me, Touch Me"
All I wanna hear about is "Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me"
One time, two time, three time and again
And again
And again
And again
It's "3 a.m. Eternal" and
It's "Band of Gold"
And "Mighty Quinn"
"I See the Moon"
And "Angelo"
Just hold me close
And I'll be home
All I wanna hear about is "Touch Me, Touch Me"
All I wanna talk about is "Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me"
One time, two time, three time and again
And again
And again
And again
All I wanna talk about is "Mississippi"
All I wanna hear about is "Jack Your Body"
One time, two time, three time and again
And again
And again
And againEmbed
