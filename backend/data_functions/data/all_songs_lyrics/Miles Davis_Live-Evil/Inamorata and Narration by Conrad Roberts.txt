Inamorata and Narration by Conrad Roberts Lyrics

Inamorato
Mission: music, masculinity
Master of the art: music
Who is this music that which description may never justify?
Can the ocean be described?
Fathomless music
Body of all that is
Live ever lastingly
Men, initiate
Inamorato, your music art tomorrow's unknown known life
I love tomorrowEmbed
