When I Was a Young Girl Lyrics
When I was a young girl, I used to seek pleasure
When I was a young girl, I used to drink ale
Out of the ale house, down into the jail house
My body's salivated and hell is my doom

Come mama, come papa, and sit you down by me
Come sit you down by me and pity my case
My poor head is aching, my sad heart in breaking
My body's salivating, and hell is my doom

Please send for the preacher to come and pray for me
And send for the doctor to heal all my wounds
My poor head is aching, my sad heart is breaking
My body's salivating and I'm bound to die

One morning, one morning, one morning in May
I saw this young lady all wrapped in white linen
All wrapped in white linen and called out the plagueEmbed
