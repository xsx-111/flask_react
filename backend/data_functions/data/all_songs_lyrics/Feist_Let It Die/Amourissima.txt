Amourissima Lyrics
Even though we said
That it was all well and done
Even though we said
That it was time to decide
Those are only words
Our hearts won't understand

Amourissima
Mon amour ici bas
Amourissima
You used to call me comme ça

Drowning out the sound
While all our thoughts come to crowd
Closing off the stream
And hope we both stay dry
But feeling makes it through
Within the rush of you

Amourissima
Mon amour ici bas
Amourissima
You used to call me comme ça

On a beau se dire
Que tout et bien et fini
On a beau se dire a le folie sa suffit
On découvrir un jour
Quel on est pas guerre

Amourissima
Mon amour ici bas
Amourissima
You used to call me comme ça
Amourissima
Amourissima
You used to call me comme ça
You called me comme çaEmbed
