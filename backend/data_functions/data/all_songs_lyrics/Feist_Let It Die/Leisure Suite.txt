Leisure Suite Lyrics
In my leisure suite
Quit talking, just for talking
Please

In my leisure suite
Sometimes
I feel the room surround me
With possibility

Build fires to stoke them
Let's fix what's been broken
Words have been stolen
But silence is golden

In my leisure suite
Just a place to meet
We can press repeat
And do what we do when we're there

Don't come knocking
This doors for locking
Have you got the key
In my leisure suite
Hang up your jacket
Undo my back zip
Please

Moonlight on blanket
It's great when your backlit
Features in close-up
The moment we woke up


In our leisure suite
Come lie next to me
We can be complete
And do what we do when we're there1Embed
