Now at Last Lyrics
Now at last, I know what a fool I've been
For I've lost the last love I should ever win
And at last I see how my heart was blind
To the joys before me that I've left behind

When the wind was fresh on the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was heard in the still
Where was I? Where was I?

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go?
What makes winters lonely?
Now at last I know

When the wind was fresh on the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was heard in the still
Where was I? Where was I?

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go?
What makes winters lonely?
Now at last I know1Embed
