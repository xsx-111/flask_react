Secret Heart Lyrics
Secret heart, what are you made of?
What are you so afraid of?
Could it be three simple words?
Or the fear of being overheard?
What's wrong?

Let him in on your secret heart

Secret heart, why so mysterious?
Why so sacred? Why so serious?
Maybe you're just acting tough
Maybe you're just not man enough
What's wrong?

Let him in on your secret heart

This very secret that you're trying to conceal
Is the very same one you're dying to reveal
Go tell her how you feel

Secret heart come out and share it
This loneliness, few can bear it
Could it have something to do with
Admitting that you just can't go through it alone?
Let him in on your secret heart

This very secret that you're trying to conceal
Is the very same one you're dying to reveal
Go tell him how you feel

This very secret heart
Go out and share it
This very secret heartEmbed
