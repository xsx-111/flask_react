Inside and Out Lyrics
Baby, I can't figure it out, your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise, oh, fool, what you trying to do?
Living on your cheating and the pain grows inside me, it's enough
To leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're driving me insane, and I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll wait, I'll never give in, our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you when your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I'm the girl who

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire?

Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in my lifetime ain't good for me
You figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever, we won't ever feel the storm
I ain't no vision, I'm the girl who

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire?

Don't try to tell me that it's over
I can't hear a word, I can't hear a line
No girl could love you more
And that's what I'm crying for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You are the reason, all my laughter, and my sorrow
Blow out the candle, I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth could stand between my loving arms
And no matter how you hurt me, I will love you 'til I die

I ain't no vision, I'm the girl who

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire?
I ain't no vision, I'm the girl who

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire?

Inside and out
Inside and out
Inside and out
Inside and out
