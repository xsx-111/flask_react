The Frontier Index LyricsOf all of the people I knew
I always looked up to you
And after millions of years of crime
The sun still shines and shines
Look, a horse, of course
Gallops through the desert light
I make such good time through sub-space
When I dream all day and write all night
Robot walks into a bar
Orders a drink, lays down a bill
Bartender says, "Hey, we don't serve robots"
And the robot says, "Oh, but someday you will"
Prison's a good time for some
Many people get caught with a gun
This trucker says it's good to be free
Says he knows lots of folks who agree
Bumper stickers talk to him
Say, "Let the stars get in your eyes"
Time, cum, sand, and surf
These are the building, building blocks of life
Boy wants a car from his dad
Dad says, "First, you got to cut that hair"
Boy says, "Hey, Dad, Jesus had long hair"
And Dad says, "That's right, son, Jesus walked everywhere"
When I was younger, I was a cobra
In every case, I wanted to be cool
Now that I'm older and sub-space is colder
Just wanna say something trueEmbed
