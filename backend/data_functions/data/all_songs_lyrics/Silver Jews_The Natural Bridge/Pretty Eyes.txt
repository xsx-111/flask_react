Pretty Eyes LyricsEverybody wants perspective from a hill
But everybody's wants can't make it past a window sill
I can see you in your room at night
Pictures on your walls
Little forest scenes and high school Halloweens
But they don't come to you
They don't come to you at all
All houses dream in blueprints
Our houses dream so hard
Outside, you can see my shoeprints
I've been dreaming in your yard
One of these days, these days will end
The kitchen window, the light will bend
You'll be carving a pumpkin with a knife
When someone at the table says:
"That's not what I call a life!"
The elephants are so ashamed of their size
Hosing them down, I tell 'em, "You got pretty eyes"
Out in the backyard, I used to make like I was a cowboy
I'd set my dog before a hoop and say, "Now boy, now boy!"
When the governor's heart fails
The state bird falls from its branch
Icicles on hell's higher hills
Meanwhile, back home at the ranch
I still get up early in the morning
And I never knew a better place
I believe that stars are the headlights of angels
Driving from heaven to save us, to save us
Look in the sky
They're driving from heaven into our eyes
And final words are so hard to devise
I promise that I'll always remember your pretty eyes
Your pretty eyesEmbed
