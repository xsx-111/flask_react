Dallas LyricsI passed out on the fourteenth floor
The CPR was so erotic
A blizzard blew in through the door
And little glowing cum buckets in her ankles
O Dallas, you shine with an evil light
O Dallas, you shine with an evil light
How'd you turn a billion steers
Into buildings made of mirrors?
And why am I drawn to you tonight?
Once you taste the geometry of a church in a cul-de-sac
You're gonna wanna sit with the bad kids in the back
Cruising down Commerce
Killing time in the blazing sun
Is it true your analyst was a placekicker for the Falcons?
We saw B.B. King on General Hospital
In the Oak Cliff dram house where we stayed
And when Clancy whipped her with his belt buckle
He cleaned her cuts and then we prayed
O Dallas, you shine with an evil light
Don't you know that God stays up all night?
How'd you turn a billion steers
Into buildings made of mirrors?
And why am I drawn to you tonight?
Watching the makeup girls make out with the mannequins
"Hey boys, supper's on me, our record just went aluminum"
Poor as a mouse every morning
Rich as a cat every night
Some kind of strange magic happens
When the city turns on her lights1Embed
