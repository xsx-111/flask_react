Pet Politics LyricsGuard my bed
While the rain turns the ditches to mirrors
Buy a vase of carnations from central Ohio
Where the looking machine can't hear us
Deep in the night, we dream of positions
There's a line for the phone in the hall
And in the cold places where Spanish is spoken
Most wars end in the fall
You never know
When your pet will go
Pet politics
Pet politics
Pet politics
Pet politics
Still wearin' last night's mascara
Now that her pet was gone for sure
She was shiverin' so hard
It looked like there were two of her
I could see through the sleeve on her blouse
The plans of her architect lover
A tattoo of a boarded-up house
And ink door that belonged to another
When the rain hits you
It hits you slow
Stitch after stitch
Stitch after stitch
Stitch after stitch
Stitch after stitch
Adam was not the first man
Though the Bible tells us so
There was one created before him
Whose name we do not know
He also lived in the garden
But he had no mouth or eyes
One day, Adam came to kill him
And he died beneath these skies
I find it so amazing how
I go where I'm led
I go where I'm led
I go where I'm led
I go where I'm led
I suspect we could be losing now
Please guard my bed
Please guard my bed
Please guard my bed
Please guard my bedEmbed
