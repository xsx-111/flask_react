Ballad of Reverend War Character LyricsMiss Mary Jane measures rain
In a cracked cup on the sill
In Embry's last photograph
He disappears over a hill
Darrell Dotson waits in the grass for a fight
The stars don't shine upon us
We're in the way of their light
No, the stars don't shine upon us
We're in the way of their light
The new girl in Tahoe
Has swallowed Sinatra's cum
A Russian primadonna
Dances slow on Valium
After the game
The benchwarmer can't get a ride
In space, there is no center
We're always off to the side
In space, there is no center
We're always off to the side
John Parker the III steps over a bird
On a Wall Street window ledge
Little Wilkie, dead cat rotting
Deep inside the hedge
Mahalia Roach dies on a
Greyhound coach in July
In a horror movie when the car won't start
You give it one last try
In a horror movie when the car won't start
You give it one last try
Guinnevere orders one more beer
In the smokey pick-up bar
A burnt out tramp by the exit ramp
Waits for one more car, one more car
The Latin teacher always smelled like piss
The census figures come out wrong
There's an extra in our midst
The census figures come out wrong
There's an extra in our midst1Embed
