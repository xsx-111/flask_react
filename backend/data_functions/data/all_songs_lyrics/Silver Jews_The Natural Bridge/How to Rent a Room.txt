How to Rent a Room LyricsNo, I don't really want to die
I only want to die in your eyes
I'm still here below the chandelier
Where they always used to read us our rights
I want to wander through the night
As a figure in the distance even to my own eye
Have you ever rented a room?
Have you even ever rented a room?
Anchor lets you see the river move
But now that your evil dreams came true
There on your face
A row of teeth he'll come to replace
I know you laughed when I left
But you really only hurt yourself
When you see your curtains move in the wind
You can bet I'm betting against you again
'Cause I'm a man who has a wife who has a mother
Who married one but she loved another
You're a tower without the bells
You're a negative wishing well
I should've checked the stable door
For the name of the sire and dam
You were always at the dog track
With your brother and all his friends
Chalk lines around my body
Like the shoreline of a lake
Your laughter made me nervous
It made your body shake too hard
Now, there's a lot of things that I'm gonna miss
Like thunder down country and the way water drips
When you're running for the door in the rain
Read the metro section
Read the metro section
Read the metro section
See my name
No, I didn't really want to die
I only want to die in your eyes
Grant me one last wish
Life should mean a lot less than this
Grant me one last wish
Life should mean a lot less than thisEmbed
