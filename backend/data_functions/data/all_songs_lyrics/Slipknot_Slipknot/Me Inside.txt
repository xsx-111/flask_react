Me Inside Lyrics
Inside, inside, inside, inside
Inside, inside, inside, inside

Giving in to what has got me
Bleeding claustrophobic, scarred
Severed me from all emotion
Life is just too fucking hard
Snap, your face was all it took
'Cause this need ain't doing me no good
Fall on my face, but can't you see?
This fucking life is killing me

Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside

Too far gone, I'm catatonic
Leaving you to criticize
Empty shell and running naked
All alone, lobotomized
Back and forth between my hang-ups
It isn't easy to be hated
Where do ya go? What do ya do?
Simpleton, impromptu
Crazy eight, I never cared
Not once, got to get away
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside

I wasn't promised a thing
You keep mocking me
But you will never again
Before you know it, after you're gone

You're gone, you're gone
Somos feos y apestamos pero reinamos joto, motherfucker
You're gone, you're gone

I wasn't promised a thing
You keep mocking me
But you will never again
Before you know it, after you're gone

Gone, gone, gone
