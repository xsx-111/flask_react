Despise Lyrics
Despise!

Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place, I deny my face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I shout at all I despise

(Ooh)
Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out
(Ooh)
Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out

Lost, run at my own cost, hearing laughter, scoffed
Searching from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak, standing on my feet, listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you dog

(Ooh)
Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out
(Ooh)
Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out
Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - despise
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
Despise!
Despise!
Despise!
Despise!

Cut me - show me - enter - I am willIng and able and never any danger to myself
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase?
Empathy, out of my way
I can't die
I can't die
I can't die
I can't die

Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - despise
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
Despise!
Despise!
Despise!
