Scissors Lyrics
I play doctor for five minutes flat
Before I cut my heart open and let the air out
Three bugs, a pound of dust, some wind spilled before me
In the strangest manner that had broke away my tear spout

As I lie there with my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube
As I injected the candied heart that I selected
She said don't hesitate, just do what you have to do to me

It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel

Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time
Biding, biding, biding, biding
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Someone in behind me
Someone inside me
Everyone against me
Everyone beside me
Clawing away the pieces
Scratching away the abscess
One more, two more
Everyone, once more
One more, two more
Everyone, once more
Inside the places that I hide from you
I want to see you splayed before me
You are the only one
That I would rather see before me
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
Don't lie; I die, you lie; I lie, oh, why?
I don't want you to pay anyone when I die
I wanna die, I'd rather die, I wanna die
You purge, you burn, you purge
I don't need you anymore, I don't need you

It is time!
It is time!
It is time!
It is time!
It is time!
It is time!
It is time!
It is time!
It is time!
It is time!
It is time!
It is time!11Embed
