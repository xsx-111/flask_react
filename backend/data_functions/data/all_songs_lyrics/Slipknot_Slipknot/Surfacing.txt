Surfacing Lyrics
Fuck you all! (All)

Running out of ways to run
I can't see, I can't be
Over and over and under my skin
All this attention is doing me in

Fuck it all, fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong, don't exist!
Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me!

Picking through the parts exposed
Taking shape, taking shag
Over and over and under my skin
All this momentum is doing me in

Fuck it all, fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong, don't exist!
Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me!
And don't you fucking judge me!
Burn!

You got all my love, living in your own hate
Dripping hole man, hard step, no fate
Show you nothing, but I ain't holding back
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack
When I get my hands on you
Ain't a fucking thing you can do
Get this 'cause you're never gonna get me
I am the very disease you pretend to be
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move

Fuck it all, fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong, don't exist!
Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me!
Fuck it all, fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong, don't exist!
Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me!
Burn!28Embed
