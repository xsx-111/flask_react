Pain
(Here comes the pain!)

Enemy, show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything even if I can't handle you
Readily, either way, it better be
Don't you fucking pity me, get up, get off
What the hell am I saying? I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent, I want somebody to step up, step off
Walls, let me fall, fuck you all
Get a grip, don't let me slip till I drop the ball

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war
Fuck it!

Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?
You're leaving me suspect, I'm leaving you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect you jealous ass, press your face against the glass, suffer

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war
Go
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you

Sick, sick, sick, sick
