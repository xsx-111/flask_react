Through Silver in Blood LyricsThrough silver in blood we stand
Judged not by eyes of flesh
When transit times cross
Prey vision consumed
Bleeding one
Bleed alone
Breeding love
Windstorm promised the teeth
Strained eyes see glory
Rings end in slow death
Wash out your wound
Rings end in slow death
Don't crawl
Seek his burn of war
When the fallout comes
He is fire2Embed
