Locust Star Lyrics
Rise

Shining blank scars burn way down
It parts ways of the serpent view
Cast stones where to stop calling you

They all lower me to the soil (Stick him)
They all lower me to the ground (Stick him)

Star, reign down
On you
Star, reign down
On you

You'll starve
Bright star in the dripping sun
Writhe on
Saints steal from your actions
Step in right on its function

They all lower me to the ground (Stick him)
They all lower me to the soil (Stick him)
Star, reign down
On you
Star, reign down
On you

The will to power
Ascension, ascension manifest
That which is above (You all lower me)
Is as that which is below (You all lower me)
That which is below (You all lower me)
Is as that which is above (You all lower me)
Thy will be done (You all lower me)
(Christ's shine blinds your world)
Thy kingdom come (You all lower me)
(Your belief is scars)
On Earth as it is in Heaven (You all lower me)
(Christ's shine blinds your world)
So mote it be
(Your belief is scars)Embed
