Strength of Fates LyricsOn this earth, lay me down
Soil my blood, this shell will fade
Gods with eyes, I'm ready now
At the hanging tree, giver of life
Great mother heal, I will rise
(I believe in you ,we all keep the flame
We are all pure flame inside)
Down spiraling outward
Revive to survive
Prey to the mystics
Prey on
Dust falls through my hands
Dreams shatter away
Burning glow turns to ash
Thrown to wind
The weave in my dreams
My strength of fates
The tunneling helix
Tongue a flame
A healing delusion
Beyond true will
A seering blue gaze
Breath my fire
What hath god wrought
Divine misthought
No senses, cold and sedate
A self-imposed
Fear-driven state
Too hurt to see
Unhidden truth
Increasing void
Worsened fateEmbed
