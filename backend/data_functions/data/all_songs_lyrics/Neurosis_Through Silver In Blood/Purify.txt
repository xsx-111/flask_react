Purify LyricsBlazing eye sees all
Nature of fiery truth
Patterns unfold
Whispers revealing
Path of spiral reaps
Fetal buried gold
Humbled in the womb
A center opens
To the unknown
Can you feel your fate
Can you see you're
Biding time hide
From your life
Drowning in the birth
Birthplace of the sun
Descending the path
Of an ascending god
Purify my hells
To climb the heavens
Sacrifice the flesh
Feeding solar visions
Set your mind to soil
Set your mind to soil
In darkness
Bringing light
A knowing old
A knowing wise
Flames to blades
On earth, stabbing
Scorching sacred lust
Fall back to stone
Fall back on spear2Embed
