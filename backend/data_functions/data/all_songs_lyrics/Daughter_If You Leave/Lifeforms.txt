Lifeforms Lyrics
From the beginning
Small lifeforms
They can kill without warning
So you don't explode
Stop your growing limbs and thinking
That you love them now you're blinking
And reminding her of him
Oh, you steal his features
And your mother is a bleacher
She don't even feel the heat, no
She don't even want to speak to you

But you
You'll always find another place to go
Oh you
You'll always find another womb to grow
To grow
To grow

Well you can try to sink down deeply
Find the children lost at sea
Find the children who discretely
Were killed in infancy
To stop them holding you and screaming
That you lose your wildest dreaming
Still reminding you of him
How he left without reasons
But you
You'll always find another place to go
Oh you
You'll always find another womb to grow
To grow
To grow

Well you can try to forget me but I won't let you easily
You can try to forget me but I won't let you easily
I'm floating out in the water washed out to sea
Drifting away with time you'll regret you've conceived it
Clean up the dead you leave behind
Just like insects
Clean up the dead you leave behind3Embed
