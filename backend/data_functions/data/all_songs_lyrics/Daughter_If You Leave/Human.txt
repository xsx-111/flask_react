Human LyricsWoken up like an animal
Teeth ready for sinking
My mind's lost in bleak visions
I've tried to escape but keep sinking
Limbs lost to a dead weight stake
Skull cage like a prison
And he's lost faith he'll ever see again
The soulmate he once thought of me then
Underneath the skin there's a human
Buried deep within there's a human
And despite everything I'm still human
But I think I'm dying here
Woken up like an animal
I'm all ready for healing
My mind's lost with nightmares streaming
Woken up (kicking screaming)
Take me out of this place I'm in
Break me out of this shell-like case I'm in
Underneath the skin there's a human
Buried deep within there's a human
And despite everything I'm still human
I think that I'm still human
I think that I'm still human
I think that I'm still human
Underneath the skin there's a human
Buried deep within there's a human
And despite everything I'm still human
But I think I'm dying here7Embed
