Touch LyricsLove, hunt me down
I can't stand to be so dead behind the eyes
And feed me, spark me up
A creature in my blood stream chews me up
So I can feel something
So I can feel something
Give me touch
Cause I've been missing it
I'm dreaming of
Strangers
Kissing me in the night
Just so I
Just so I
Can feel something
Can feel something
Can feel something
Can feel something
You steal me away
With your eyes and with your mouth
And just take me back to a room in your house
And stare at me with the lights off
To feel something
To feel something
To feel something
To feel something
In the night
In the night
In the night
When we touch
In the night
Cause I've been missing it5Embed
