Smoke LyricsIn a smoke filled room
With your father watching me
There's three doors and no keys
It's rising, it's choking me
In a smoke filled room
In a smoke filled room
There's a man with no face
Just a blurred out portrait, in a photo frame
I'm losing again, I'm losing my friend
He's face down on the pavement
Then a woman, she screams, it's a terrible night
As the mood changes to dark from light
Tell the doctor what's become of me
So you can analyse, analyse my dreams
Of a smoke filled room
Of a smoke filled room
Of a smoke filled room
Then we kiss and his lips turn into sand
And the whole of him cascades through my hands
Making a castle on the floor
Then I'm alone again
No keys and three doors
In a smoke filled room
Now we're both in the room, and we're breathing the fumes
No doors this time, just a gap in the roof
Light floods in, heaven, we're blind
And slowly suffocating, we're dying
In a smoke filled room
We're dying in a smoke filled room
We're dying in a smoke filled room
(In a smoke filled room)
In a smoke filled room
In a smoke filled room
In a smoke filled room1Embed
