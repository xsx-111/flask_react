Paris Nights/New York Mornings LyricsBreakfast at Mickey's, make-up still on
Elbows on the greasy table cloth
One more coffee and one last cigarette
Smiling at the rain cause you hold me close
My best dress on underneath this old coat
Walking down Bleecker no one is awake yet
And onward, seven hours
Nothing but clouds
It's enough to make your heart sigh
I thought we should try
Pick me up and take me out
Oo we crash into love-filled nights
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Oo we race till we're out of time
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
And now that you've taken me up so high
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
I could see the lights from the restaurant
I couldn't quite perfect that nonchalance
Paris and champagne with one brown sugar cube
And we danced while the band played "She's not there"
Kissed me in the rain by the Rue Voltaire
It's a perfectly good way to ruin those silk shoes
Still, seven hours
Nothing but clouds
It's enough to make your heart sigh
We should try
For each other and for the lovers
Oo we crash into love-filled nights
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Oo we race till we're out of time
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
And now that you've taken me up so high
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
You change and you grow
But we were young
We were young and we didn't know
We didn't know
Oo we crash into love-filled nights
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Oo we race till we're out of time
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
And now that you've taken me up so high
(Paris nights and New York mornings)
Don't let me down
Don't let me downEmbed
