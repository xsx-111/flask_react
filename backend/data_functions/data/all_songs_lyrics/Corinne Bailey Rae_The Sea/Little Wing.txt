Little Wing LyricsOoh ooh
Oh she is walking through the clouds
With the circle smile that's running around
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairy tales
Riding little wings
When I'm sad, she calms me
With a thousands smiles, she gives to me free
Listen it's alright, she says it's alright
To take anything you want from me, anything
Well she's walking through the clouds
With the circle smile that is running around
Well it's alright, it's alright
Take anything you want from me, anything, anything
Well it's alright, it's alright
Well it's alright, it's alright
Well it's alright, it's alright
Well it's alright, it's alright
AlrightEmbed
