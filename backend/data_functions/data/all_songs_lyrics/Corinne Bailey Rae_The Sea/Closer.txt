Closer LyricsI don't want to give you up
I don't want to hold you up
I don't want ambiguous
I just know that I've had enough
I want you to travel with me
Let it loose and let your mind go free
Show you things that you've never seen
But you just got to go with me, oh
Your love is so good that I want to show you
Don't make me responsible
For something you that can't find, ooh
Your loving is so good, so good, the closer
I want it, I want it into me
I want it, I want it, leave it here
I want it, I want it
I want to get closer to you, baby
Experience
I want it, I want it, generous
Lay down what's impeding you
Cause I wanna get closer to you, baby
I don't want to give you up
But I'm tired of the pull and push
I'm tired of the making up
Don't you feel like you've had enough?
I want you to journey with me
Explore all the innocence
I don't mind us to build tension
But we've got to move in the same direction, oh
Your love is so good that I want to show you
Don't make me responsible
For something you that can't find
Ooh, your loving is so good, so good, the closer
I want it, I want it into me
I want it, I want it, leave it here
I want it, I want it
I want to get closer to you baby
Experience
I want it, I want it, generous
Lay down what's impeding you
Cause I, I want to get closer to you, baby
I wanna, I wanna get
Wanna, I wanna get closer
Oh, you just got to go with me, oh
Your love is so good that I want to show you
Don't make me responsible
For something you that can't find
Ooh, your loving is so good, so good, the closer
I want it, I want it into me
I want it, I want it, leave it here
I want it, I want it
I wanna get close to you baby
Experience
I want it, I want it, generous
Lay closer
I want it, I want it closer
I wanna get close, I wanna, I wanna get close
I wanna, I wanna get close, closer
I wanna get close, oh yeah, baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby
I wanna get, wanna get1Embed
