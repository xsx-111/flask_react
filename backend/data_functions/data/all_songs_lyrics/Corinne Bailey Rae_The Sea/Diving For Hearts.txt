Diving For Hearts LyricsTill then I wasn't alive
I longed for you like the lovesick moon pulls the tide
So I peeled off my skin
I just slipped right in
And I become alive
'Cause down here there's no fear
There's no cause for panic
There's just bright cold calm
I feel no harm
This underwater feeling's abandon and it fires my heart
Was it emotion
Or should I just keep on diving
Keep on diving down?
Under this ocean
I long to keep on diving
Till my heart is found
It's got a hold on me
Can't forget the things I've seen
World will all end
And new worlds will begin
It's a thought so stark
We're at once determinant
Yet so insignificant
Spinning out in the velvet dark
Still, down here
There's no fear
There's no cause for panic
There's just this bright cold calm
Yeah, it leaves a scar
So show me how to find again
If I'm lost, show me where you are
Was it emotion
Or should I just keep on diving
Keep on diving down?
Under this ocean
I long to keep on diving
Till my heart is found
It's got a hold on me
Can't forget the things I've seenEmbed
