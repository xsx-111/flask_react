Feels Like The First Time LyricsI could pretend that I was okay
I wind around the parties, drink in hand
I could pretend when you went away
That I had changed and I no longer hear the band
But I won't lie, I found a love, I had to rediscover
I was emotionally scarred, we could not get it away
There are times when it breaks and I feel amazed
Feels just like the first time when you kiss me, my lover
Angels in the sky will descend on our love
And it's hard to deny what is happening
Although we talk, talk, talk on the telephone
We laugh, laugh, laugh at the things we know
I've been a soldier for much too long
I'd willingly surrender all my arms
If you decided you won't be long
I'd wait here patient for you
Look for you every morning
Had this love, these were sparks, we tried to push it on
But I was afraid of the dark , we could not get it away
Never mind what they say I would feel the same
Feels just like the first time when you kiss me, my lover
Angels in the sky will descend on our love
And it's hard to describe what is happening
Although we talk, talk, talk on the telephone
We laugh, laugh, laugh at the things you know, ooh
Feels just like the first time
If I could choose then my heart would be in it
My charms would be in it, my love would be in it
Know you hang on this time
(Feels just like the last time)
Know you knew that I was coming home
But you still won't give me the answer, oh
(Feels just like the last time)
Feels just like the first time when you kiss me, my lover
Angels in the sky will descend on our love
And it's hard to deny what is happening
Although we talk, talk, talk on the telephone
We laugh, laugh, laugh at the things you know, oohEmbed
