Are You Here LyricsHe's a real live wire
He's the best of his kind
Wait till you see those eyes
He dresses like this different scene
He'll kiss you, make you feel sixteen
What's it even mean?
Are you here, are you here?
Are you here cause my heart
Recalls that it all seems the same
It all feels the same, pick me up
It's hard to recall the taste of summer
When everywhere around, the chill of winter
It gets so far away
Are you here, are you here?
Are you here cause my heart
Recalls that it all feels the same
And he comes to lay me down
In a garden of tuberose's
When he comes around
There's nothing more to imagine
Just tuberose's, tuberose's
Are you here? Are you here?
Are you here cause my heart
Recalls that it all seems like
All looks like, it all feels like
It tasted like, tasted, tasted like
When he comes to lay me down
In a garden of tuberose's
When he comes around
There's nothing more to imagine
Just tuberose's, tuberose's
Wait till you see those eyesEmbed
