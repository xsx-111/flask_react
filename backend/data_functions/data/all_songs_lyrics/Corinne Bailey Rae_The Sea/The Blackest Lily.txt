The Blackest Lily LyricsI didn't know what the day was
I didn't know what the time it was
I didn't know what my heart would do
I was afraid of nothing
When you called me on the telephone
I was a creature of appetites
And we played a game that you didn't like
There wasn't nothing that I could do
I can be so bad, I can be so bad
They just took it away and they broke it in two
Oh, oh
Color my heart, color my heart
Make it restart, make it restart
Color my heart
I want it more than I ever knew
The blackest lily, the blackest pony
Won't protect my heart from you, oh, oh, oh
You were unnervingly delicate
And I had a weakness for etiquette
You laid a trail that led straight to your door, oh
And I could resist but it was hard to ignore, oh
Color my heart, color my heart
Make it restart, make it restart
Color my heart
I want it more than I ever knew
Oh, The blackest lily, the blackest pony
Won't protect my heart from you, oh
The blackest lily, the blackest pony
I didn't know what the day was
I didn't know what the time it was
I didn't know what my heart would do
And I was afraid of nothing
When you called, called me on the telephone
Color my heart, color my heart
Make it restart, make it restart
Color my heart
I want it more than I ever knew, oh
Oh, the blackest lily, the blackest pony
Won't protect my heart from you
Oh, color my heart, color my heart
Make it restart, make it restart
Color my heart
I want it more than I ever knew
Oh, the blackest lily, the blackest pony
Won't protect my heart from you, oh
Oh, oh, ohEmbed
