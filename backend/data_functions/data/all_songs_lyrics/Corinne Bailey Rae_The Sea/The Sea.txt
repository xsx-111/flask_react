The Sea Lyrics
I never knew you were standing on the shore
It says everything
Explains everything
That from then on it couldn't be just like before
It says everything
Changes everything
So don't you stand there wishing your life would fade away
And don't you go round with anyone who makes you feel ashamed

Goodbye paradise
I hope there's something you could try
Goodbye
You're so changed that you'd give it all away
Goodbye
Goodbye

I saw your face in the faded light
Said everything
Explained everything
It haunts all your days and it comes to you at night
You did everything
Blame anything
But don't you cut those ribbons to take away the pain
And don't you go round with that same old crowd
They make you feel ashamed
Goodbye paradise
I hope there's something you could try
Goodbye
You're so changed that you'd give it all away
Goodbye
Goodbye paradise
The sea
The majestic sea
Breaks everything
Crushes everything
Cleans everything
Takes everything
