Paper Dolls LyricsYou have incredible eyes
And all the boys will go wild for you
But I was scared
In case you made me do those things
But would you, oh
Would you believe me that I was your fool?
'Cause I've been lying awake at night
Wondering where you are now
And if that metal turned out right
All my life, all my life, she said, it's not right
Nobody told me I could do something
Nobody told me I could be something, yeah
I have tried, I have tried, she said, it's alright
Nobody told me I could do something
Nobody told me I could be something
You wore indelible smiles
You were divorced from inside, they said
But I was disturbed
When I heard that it's not what you preferred
It gets to the point they expected
And who are you to disappoint them anyway
Time will get you in the end
Just when you shook off that regret
Around the corner comes a memory
In a fur coat to talk about it
All my life, all my life, she said, it's not right
Nobody told me I could do something
Nobody told me I could be something, yeah
I have tried, I have tried, she said, it's alright
Nobody told me I could do something
Nobody told me I could be something
Many words that have been spoken
Cut me out like paper dolls
Made me into something different
Something I could not dissolve
It's over, over, don't let their words control ya
All my life, all my life, she said, it's not right
Nobody told me I could do something
Nobody told me I could be something, yeah
I have tried, I have tried, she said, it's alright
Nobody told me I could do something
Nobody told me I could be somethingEmbed
