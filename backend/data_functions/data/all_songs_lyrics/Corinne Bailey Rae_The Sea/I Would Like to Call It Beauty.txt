I Would Like to Call It Beauty LyricsSo young for death
We walk in shoes too big
But you play it like a poet
Like you always did
And I lay face upturned on the palm of God
Pushed on by the fingertips of dreams
They haunted me
Consoling me
And I would like to call, call it beauty
Strained as love's become, it still amazes me
And I would like to call it beauty, ....
You slept a sigh like the angels speak
And we danced into tomorrow on bleeding feet
And I had thought that I would die here
But you pushed me on
You pushed me on
You pushed me on
(Oh) And I would like to call it beauty
Strained as love's become, it still amazes me
And I would like to call it beauty, ....
You can keep it all locked up in your leaden chest
Or you can lay mouth open on the water's edge
But all your angels and your God will stitch and wash you
Oh I would like to call, call it beauty
Strained as love's become, it still amazes me
And I would like to call it beauty, ....1Embed
