Dancing on the Edge LyricsLiving on the moonshine
It's the season and I'm insane
Living on the moonshine's a crazy scene
Laughing through the morning sunshine
Rollin' in the rain is all I need, is all I need
Ridin' on the wings of thunder
Blinded by a full moon's light
I'm runnin' like a river full of hunger
Oh, I'm dancin' on the edge tonight
Oh, mama says it's alright
But I'm leaving it all behind
If mama says it's all right, it's fine with me
Runnin' through a distant thunder
In a summer's rain is all I need, is all I need
Ridin' on the wings of thunder
Blinded by a full moon's light
I'm runnin' like a river full of hunger
Oh, I'm dancin' on the edge tonight
Ooh, livin' on the moonshine
It's the season and I'm insane
Livin' on the moonshine's a crazy scene
I'm never, never, never looking back on my time
Gotta keep on movin' do you know what I mean
You know what I mean
Ridin' on the wings of thunder
Blinded by a full moon's light
I'm runnin' like a river full of hunger
