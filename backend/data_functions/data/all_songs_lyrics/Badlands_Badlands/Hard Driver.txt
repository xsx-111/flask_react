Hard Driver LyricsTearing down the highway lines
It's a fever that I know
Tonight my burning bridges light the skies
The engine screams for murder
And tonight we're gonna bleed
Pushin' the limit through
On a red light rocket ride
The wheel's on fire, but it's alright, alright
They're gonna burn for me tonight
Hard driver, ridin' alone
'Cause there's no lookin' back and you're never comin' home
Hard driver, you're on your own
Give it all, hard driver
Turn the ship into the wind
Let the engines roar
Curse the gods and let the metal cry
The eyes of total madness
Are the windows to the soul
You'd be a fool to stop on the edge of lost control
The wheel's on fire but it's alright, alright
They're gonna burn for me tonight
Hard driver, ridin' alone
'Cause there's no lookin' back and you're never comin' home
Hard driver, you're on your own
Give it all, hard driver
Ohh
Ohh
Hard driver, ridin' alone
'Cause there's no lookin' back and you're never comin' home, yeah, yeah
Hard driver, you're on your own
Give it all hard driver
Give it all hard driver
And there's no looking back 'cause you're never coming homeEmbed
