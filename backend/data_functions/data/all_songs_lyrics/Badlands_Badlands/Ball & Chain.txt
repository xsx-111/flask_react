Ball & Chain LyricsAlright
Hey now won't ya listen about a tale of a heartbreak queen
The kind of girl that makes Bogie fall on a late night movie screen
She wraps a look around ya turns a wise man to the fool
Lord, save my soul 'cause I feel like I'm fallin' through
I said yeah, alright
Gimme that ball and chain now
I hear the sound of sweet and rumble, every time that she walks on by
Your song keeps burnin' in my ears makes me wanna crawl deep inside
Sweet jesus, it gives me trouble, something I don't understand
The girl has got a chain around my heart, help me, Jesus, to the promise land
Alright, alright
Gimme that ball and chain now
Oh, oh, shine
Oh, oh, oh, fall Angelica, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Before too long I know
You'll be back in my arms before too long
Lord, save me now
Sweet sound of mercy, such a hard woman to know
Her freedom flies like a golden bird, it's makin' me lose control
All I know is that I love her, sweet Jesus, hear my plea
All I know is that the heartbreak queen is taking a piece of me, of me, of me
Alright, alright
Gimme that ball and chain now
Gimme that ball and chain now
Alright
Well, gimme that ball and chain, yeah
Ooh, oh, yeahEmbed
