Seasons LyricsI know it's late, and the evenings gently giving ground
Shadows remain of the words that were never spoken
All the years that we once held in our hands
Just leave us to wonder still the winds are changing all the time
But I know it's too late
The seasons all gone by, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Seasons can wait 'til a thousand years have come and gone
Stories we wrote all the days that were never counted
Time alone all the dreams we thought would never die
But then there's tomorrow for these dreams will save our lonely times
But I know it's too late
The seasons all gone by, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Hear the crashing sound as time slips away
Feel the thunder ride the road
Wearing this chain on my hands that I'm sure to bare
Oh, love rain on you forever more, oh
Oh, listen
I know it's late, and the evening's gently giving ground
Shadows remain of the words that were never spoken
Though I dream sometimes dreams are all I know
Leave us to wonder though the winds are changing all the time
But I know it's too late
The seasons all gone by, oh, whoa
But I know it's too late
The seasons all gone by, oh, oh, oh
But I know it's too late
The seasons all gone by
Oh, feels so good, oh
And you feel so good, oh, oh
And things must change oh, for the center is now, oh
You can feel a change there's something in ya all
You just don't know, listen
Oh, oh
But I know it's too late
The seasons all gone byeEmbed
