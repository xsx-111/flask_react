High Wire LyricsStandin' here, I got my eye on you
Your story bleeds, but there's no review
Honey drip and set my soul on fire
Stealin' hearts got me walkin' the wire
You're gonna lose control
All night long
When I find my love, love, love
High wire
Flash a smile, like a shiny blade
Everyone there thinks ya got it made
Sorry, child, can you take me higher
But you keep me hangin' on your lonely wire
You're gonna lose control
All night long
When I find my love, love, love
High wire
Oh, feels so good
You give me lovin' like no one could
You turn me child, inside out
Still you leave me drownin' in a sea of doubt
You're gonna lose control
All night long
You're gonna steal my soul, mama
You can't go wrong
When I find my love, love, love
High wire
Love, love, love
Oh, sweet child, I know where you come from now
High wire, baby
Oh, oh, oh1Embed
