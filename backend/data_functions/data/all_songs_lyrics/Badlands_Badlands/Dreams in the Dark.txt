Dreams in the Dark LyricsI remember you baby like a sweet summer song
Said you'd love me forever nothing could ever go wrong
Time's gone by I'm just a memory scarred
I'm lost in a shadow don't know where you are
'Cause yesterday's gone
Dreams carry on
Will you return my way, no
Sing me a sweet, sweet song
Turn out the lights and my love will burn on and on
Hold me until tomorrow
Dreams in the dark
Dreams in the dark
You pushed me, baby a little too far
Turned your back on my lovin' lick my wounds in the bars
Story's been told and a lesson is learned
I know where your love lies and I know where you burn
'Cause yesterday's gone
Dreams carry on
Will you return my way, no
Sing me a sweet, sweet song
Turn out the lights and my love will burn on and on
Hold me until tomorrow
Dreams in the dark
Baby, I know that you're leavin' it's over, it's over, I know
Now that my heart now is bleedin' don't know which way to turn, no no
Sing me a sweet, sweet song
Turn out the lights and my love will burn on and on
Hold me until tomorrow
Dreams in the dark
Sing me a sweet, sweet song
Turn out the lights and my love will burn on and on
Hold me until tomorrow
Dreams in the dark
Dreams in the dark
Dreams in the dark
Oh, oh, ohEmbed
