Last Chance to Lose Your Keys Lyrics
I cashed in all my chips tonight
And combed my hair till it was just right
Cause I've been thinking 'bout you and me girl
And we've got something going on
Tell me you can't wait to see me
And you didn't bother to even show up
This whole situation's incredibly typical

I should've seen it all along
I should've seen it all along
I should've seen it all along
It's girls like you that make me think I'm better off

Home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you, baby

Call me on the phone
And you don't even wanna talk
Staring at you from across the room
But turn your back when I walk up
We got inches away
And I never even got close
Leave your lipstick at home
Don't pick up the phone
Don't bother to look in my direction
I should've seen it all along
I should've seen it all along
It's girls like you that make me think I'm better off

Home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you, baby
Home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you, baby

Forget everything you think you know about me
Forget everything you think you know about me
This isn't high school

I'm better off home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you, baby
Forget everything you think you know about me
This isn't high school3Embed
