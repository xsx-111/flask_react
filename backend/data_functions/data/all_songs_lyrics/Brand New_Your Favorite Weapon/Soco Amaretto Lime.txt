Soco Amaretto Lime Lyrics
Passed out on the overpass
Sunday best and broken glass
Broken down from the bikes and bars
Suspended like spirits over speeding cars
You and me were kings
Over the parkway tonight
And tonight will go on forever while we
Walk around this town like we own the streets
And stay awake through summer like we own the heatSinging—
"Everybody wake up
It's time to get down" 
Wake up
Everybody, everybody wake up, it's time to get downAnd when I pass the bottle back to Pete
On the overpass tonight, I bet we laugh
I'm gonna stay eighteen forever
So we can stay like this forever
And we'll never miss a party
'Cause we keep them goin' constantly
And we'll never have to listen
To anyone about anything
'Cause it's all been done
And it's all been said
We're the coolest kids
And we take what we can getCut me open
Sun poisoned
This offer
Stands forever
New haircut
New bracelet
Eyeliner—the hell out of this town
Find some conversation
The low-fuel light's been on for days
It doesn't mean anything
I've got another 500 'nother 500 miles
Before we shut this engine down (we shut it down)

I'm gonna stay eighteen forever
So we can stay like this forever
And we'll never miss a party
'Cause we keep them goin' constantly
And we'll never have to listen
To anyone about anything
'Cause it's all been done
And it's all been said
We're the coolest kids
And we take what we can getCut me open
Sun poisoned
This offer
Stands forever
New haircut
New bracelet
Eyeliner
Wait foreverEighteen forever
So we can stay
Like this forever
And we'll never miss a party
'Cause we keep them
Going constantly

And we'll never have to listen
To anyone
About anything
'Cause it's all been done
And it's all been said
We're the coolest kids
And we take what we
Can getYou're just jealous 'cause
I'm young and in love
Your stomach's filled up but
You're starved for conversation
You're spending all your nights
Growing old in your bed
And your tearin' up your photos
'Cause you want to forget—
It's over
You're just jealous 'cause
I'm young and in love
Your stomach's filled up but
You're starved for conversation
You're spending all your nights
Growing old in your bed
And you're tearin' up your photos
'Cause you want to forget—
It's over
Just jealous cause we're young and in love
You're just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
You're just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
You're just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
You're just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
You're just jeal—6Embed
