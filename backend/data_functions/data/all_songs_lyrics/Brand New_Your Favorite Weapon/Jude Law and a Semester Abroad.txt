Jude Law and a Semester Abroad Lyrics
Whatever poison's in this bottle
Will leave me broken, sore and stiff
But it's the genie at the bottom who I'm sucking at
He owes me one last wish
So here's a present, to let you know I still exist
I hope the next boy that you kiss has
Something terribly contagious on his lips

But I got a plan
(I got a plan)
I'll drink for forty days and forty nights
(I'm not well-prepared)
A sip for every second-hand tick
And every time you fed the line
“You mean so much to me...”
I'm without you

Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say

And even if her plane crashes tonight
She'll find some way to disappoint me
By not burning in the wreckage
Or drowning, at the bottom of the sea
"Jess, I still taste you, and thus reserve my right to hate you
And all this empty space that you create
Does nothing for my flawless sense of style."

It's 8:45 (It's 8:45)
The weather is getting better by the hour (rains all the time)
I hope it rains there all the time
And if you ever said you miss me then don't say you never lied
I'm without you

Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say
Who would do anything you say

Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
No more songs about you
After this one I am done
You are, you are, you're gone
No more songs about you
After this one I am done
You are, you are, you're gone
No more songs about you
After this one I am done
You are, you are, you're gone
No more songs about you
After this one I am done
You are, you are, you're gone
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say1Embed
