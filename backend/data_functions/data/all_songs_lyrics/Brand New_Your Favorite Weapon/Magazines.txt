Magazines Lyrics
Laetitia, you destroy me
So I can see why I feel so lonely
When you and me could be forever perfectly perfect together, I know
Broken down in my dead bedroom
Stuttering to pictures of you
I know that you can always see me
Saw you staring through my TV last night

So I'll leave my door open all night
In case you decide you want to stop on by
Cause you got to know who's been singing that song on the radio
The one that goes...

My friends all call me crazy 'cause I stay up late anticipating
And planning for the day I sweep you off your feet
I'd never leave you alone
Laetitia, you got my hands shaking
I'm begging you, oh, baby, please, stop breaking my heart
'Cause I got the feeling you and I will never really get it on


Girl, come to me
The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need
Or I'll be left alone forever with my magazines
Girl, come to me
The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need
Or I'll be left alone foreverâ€¦
Laetitia, you destroy me
So I can see why I feel so lonely
When you and me could be forever
Perfectly perfect together, I knowEmbed
