...My Nine Rides Shotgun LyricsIt's happened before
I'm sure it'll happen again
It's getting old
Like you never know
It's not the first time
She said it's the last time again
And you're a tease
Have fun overseas
No, I'm kidding
Give it some time
Take my advice
She leaves scars on me
Like she's marking territory
But I know a million girls would kill to be you right now
Give me one night inside of your thighs
A million girls would kill to be you right now
And it's happened before
And it'll happen again
When your boyfriend comes home I suggest he keeps you terribly close
And you'd never know
Wouldn't be the first time
Don't think this will ever end
And you're a tease
Have fun studying abroad
No, I'm kidding
Give it some time
Take my advice
She leaves scars on me
Like she's marking territory
But I know a million girls would kill to be her right now
Give me one night inside of your thighs
A million girls would kill to be you right now
And it's happened before
It'll happen again
Better things to do than her
The girl I want is going to come through
And might make up your mind
And call me when you get homeEmbed
