Mix Tape Lyrics
I got a twenty dollar bill
That says no one's ever seen you
Without makeup
You're always made up
And I'm sick of your tattoos
And the way you always criticize
The Smiths
And Morrissey
And I know that you're a sucker
For anything acoustic
But when I say let's keep in touch
I really mean I wish that you'd grow up

This is the first song for your mixtape
And it's short, just like your temper
But somewhat golden like the afternoons
We used to spend before you got too cool

I got a twenty-dollar bill
That says no one's ever seen you
Without makeup
You're always made up
And I'm sick of your tattoos
And the way you don't appreciate
Brand New
Or me
And I know that you're a sucker
For anything acoustic
But when I say let's keep in touch
I hope you know I mean I wish that you'd grow up
This is the first song for your mixtape
It's short just like your temper
But somewhat golden like the afternoons
We used to spend before you got too cool...
(Yeah, but I wish you were my shadow)Embed
