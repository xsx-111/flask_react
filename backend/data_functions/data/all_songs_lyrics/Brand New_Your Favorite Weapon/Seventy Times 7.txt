Seventy Times 7 Lyrics
Back in school they never taught us what we needed to know
Like how to deal with despair, or someone breaking your heart
For twelve years I've held it all together
But a night like this is begging to pull me apart
I played it quiet, left you deep in conversation
I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen
I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would
And now I know I want to kill you like only a best friend could

Everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on to

As if this happening wasn't enough
I got to go and write a song just to
Remind myself how bad it sucked
Ignore the sun, the cover's over my head
I wrote a message on my pillow that says
"Jesse, stay asleep in bed"
So don't apologize (I hope you choke and die!)
Search your cell for something with which to hang yourself
They say you need to pray if you want to go to heaven
But they don't tell you what to say
When your whole life has gone to hell
Everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on toAnd everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on toAnd I can't let you
Let me down again
And I can't let you
Let me down again
So, is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in 11-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield
Is that what you call tact?
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
So let's end this call, and end this conversation
And is that what you call a getaway?
Well tell me what you got away with
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed
When you say best friends means friends forever
Is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in 11-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield
And everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on to

And everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on toAnd I can't let you
Let me down again
And I can't let you
Let me down again
And I can't let you
Let me down again
And I can't let you
Let me down again10Embed
