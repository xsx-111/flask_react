Marlene LyricsCoyne
Girl of my dream, Marlene
You know who I mean, Marlene
You're just a dream oh Marlene
Why don't you let me come in, let me come in
Verse
You sit there every night, Marlene
You are just right, Marlene
When I turn on my light, oh Marlene
Why don't you let me come in, let me come in
Verse
Paper is torn, Marlene
Paper on the wall, Marlene
And I'm just a boy, oh Marlene
Why don't you let me come in, let me come in
I say hey, hey pretty girl I say hey, hey pretty girl
I say hey, hey pretty girl
Hey pretty girl, hey pretty girl
Verse
Turn off my light, oh Marlene
You are just a fright, Marlene
Come here tonight, Marlene
Why don't you let me come in, let me come inEmbed
