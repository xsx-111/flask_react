Mummy LyricsDaddy let the dogs of war out, let them bite me now
Daddy let the dogs of war out, let them bite me now
Daddy let the dogs of war out, let them bite me now
Set them out to chew, oh, to chew all my boots and shoes
Daddy let the sheeps of peace out, let them graze around
Daddy let the sheeps of peace out, let them graze around
Daddy let the sheeps of peace out, let them graze around
Set them out to see me, oh, be me so peacefully
Daddy, set your old face smiling, set it smiling now
Daddy, set your old face smiling, set it smiling now
Smile and smile and smile and smile
'Cause that's all I ever wanted to see is
When you're smiling and you're chuckling at me
Daddy get angry, angry, angry, angry, angry do
Daddy get angry, angry, angry, angry, angry do
Daddy get angry, angry, angry, angry, angry do
'Cause that's all I know of you when you go, when you're going
Mummy, mummy, where's mummy?
Where's mummy? Where's mummy?
Mummy's in the garden wearing her best clothes
Mummy's in the garden wearing her best clothes
Mummy's in the garden, wearing her pretty best clothes
Mummy, mummy, mummy, isn't daddy funny?
Let's hide away till he finds, till he finds a way, till he finds a wayEmbed
