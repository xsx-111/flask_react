Need Somebody LyricsNow, that I'm getting old and
Now, I'm getting cold and
There's nothing left to say
Just like a daffodil, you know I will
You know wilting in my way
And I need somebody
Yes, I need somebody
Yes, I need, need somebody
Now, I know I'm getting old
This is a lonely life
Man, without your wife
Without a bed or view
I'm always at the gate
And I'm always late
'Cause there's nothing left to do
And I need somebody
Yes, I need, need somebody
Yes, I need, I need somebody
Now, I know I'm getting old
Strange tunes in my head
I'll think I'll go to bed
I think I'll change the sheets and all
Maybe do some drawing
Do some painting
An antelope across my wall
And I need somebody
Yes, I need, need somebody
Yes, I need anybody
Now, I know I'm getting old
A visitor out on the lawn
His hair all shorn
Is he friend or is he foe?
Is he a man I know?
Is he someone to sow?
Is he someone to say hello?
And I need somebody
Yes, I need, need somebody
Yes, I need, need somebody
Now, I know I'm getting old
So, I'm so confused
I'm so bemused
I think I'll settle down
Lie down on anywhere
Maybe in this chair
Anywhere I just don't care
Because I need somebody
Yes, I need, oh, somebody
Yes, I need anybody
Now, I know I'm getting old
The friend I saw is at the door
He says, "Hello, once more
I met you down the road"
Great long fingers holding out
I want to shout
What's the point because he knows
That I need, I need somebody
Yes, I need somebody
Yes, I need almost anybody
Now, I know I'm getting old
Yes, I need, I need somebody
Yes, I need, I need somebody
Oh, I need almost anybody
Now, I know I'm getting, getting oldEmbed
