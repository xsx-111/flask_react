Araby LyricsI want to take a trip to Araby
I want to take a trip to Araby
I want to see the sun descend on a maiden's knees
I want to ride in a great bronze butterfly
I want to ride in a great bronze butterfly
I want to see the sun descend in a great big blue Arabian sky
I want to go where white men never go
I want to go where white men never go
I want to see those natives dancing their ho-di-ho, dancing their
Oh, dance all night
I want to take my trip to Araby
I want to take my trip to Araby
You know it's a-ra-ra-ra, a-ra-ra-ra
A-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-byEmbed
