Solid Rock  LyricsWell now take a look at that
I made a castle in the sand
Saying this is where it's at you
Couldn't understand now
If I realised that the chances were slim
How come I'm so surprised when the tide rolled in
Gonna live on solid rock
Gonna live on solid rock
Wanna give I don't wanna be blocked
I'm gonna live on solid rock
Well I'm sick of potential
I'm sick of vanity now
I'm sticking to essential reality now
I don't know what's worse
Try to make a silk purse
Living an illusion in confusion
Gonna live on solid rock
Gonna live on solid rock
Gonna live I don't wanna be blocked
I'm gonna live on solid rock
You know a house of cards
Never built for shock
You could blow it down in any kind of weather
Now you take two solid rocks two solid blocks
You know they're gonna stick
Yeah they're gonna stick together oh-oh
Yeah because the heart that you break
That's the one that you rely on
The bed that you make
That's the one you gotta lie on
When you point your finger cos your plan fell through
You got three more fingers pointing back at you yeah
Gonna live on solid rock
I'm gonna live on solid rock
I wanna give I don't wanna be blocked
I'm gonna live on solid
Rock rock solid rock
Rock rock solid rock
I wanna give I don't wanna be blocked
I'm gonna live on solid
Rock rock solid rock
Rock rock solid rock
I wanna give I don't wanna be blocked
I'm gonna live on solid solid solid solid rock
Solid rock
