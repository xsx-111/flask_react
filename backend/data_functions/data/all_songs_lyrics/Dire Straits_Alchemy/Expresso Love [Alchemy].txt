Expresso Love  LyricsOne two one two three four
She gets the sun in the daytime
Perfume in the dusk
And she come out in the night time
With the honeysuckle musk
Because she smells like a rose
And she tastes just like a peach
She got me walking where the wildlife goes
I'd do anything to reach her
And she was made in heaven
Heaven's in the world
Oh she was made in heaven
Heaven's in the world
Is this just expresso love
You know I'm crazy for the girl
Just a-crazy for the girl
Yeah she call me just to talk
Well she's my lover she's a friend of mine
Says hey mister d'you wanna take a walk
In the wild west end sometime
And I get trouble with my breathing
When she says boys don't know anything
But I know what I want (I want 'o tell you something)
Yes I want everything
Cos she was made in heaven
And heaven's in the world
Oh she was made in heaven
Yes heaven's in the world
Is this just expresso love
See I'm crazy for the girl
Just a-crazy for the girl
Yeah you know I feel so good cos I feel so good
And I feel so good cos it feels so right
I was made to go with my girl
Just like a saxophone was made to go with the night
Take it take it
She can raise one eyebrow
Put her hand on my hip
And I close one eye now
Sweat on her lip oh
Oh and I surrender to the fever
And I surrender to the will of the night
She love me so tender I got to believe her
Love? Huh! Expresso love's alright
Cos she was made in heaven
Heaven's in the world
Oh she was made in heaven
Heaven's in the world
Is this expresso love
You know I'm crazy for the girl
Just a-crazy for the girl
My my my my
No well I don't want no sugar in it
No thank you very very very
All wired up on it all fired up on it
Expresso touch
Hey maestro expresso now
Hey maestro she said expresso now
It's just another one just like the other one
It's just another one just like the other other one
Oh hey maestro expresso now
I say hey maestro expresso now
Just like the other oneEmbed
