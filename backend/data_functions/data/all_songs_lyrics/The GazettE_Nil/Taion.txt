Taion LyricsA wintry sky and the broken streetlight cold wind
Unknown shadow the footprint of desertion
Freedom was taken
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
If it wakes up a gloomy ceiling
A laughing voice sinks in the eardrum it is soiled
And violence rapes me, rapes me, rapes me
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
Why was I chosen? Someone should answer...
Dou ka hidoi yume da to kotaete hoshii
Dore dake sakebi modae kurushimeba ii
Dou ka hidoi yume da to oshiete hoshii
Chigiresou na koe de nando mo sakenda
There is no hand of preparing of the disordered hair
A laughing voice sinks in the eardrum a faint temperature is mixed in the midwinter
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
An understanding is impossible
Koe wo koroshite karesou na jibun ni ii kikaseteita
Ikiru koto wo miushinawanu you
Koe wo koroshite furueta yoru wa itami ni oboreteiku
Togiresou na iki wo yurushite...
Dou ka hidoi yume da to kotaete hoshii
Dore dake sakebi modae kurushimeba ii
Dou ka hidoi yume da to oshiete hoshii
Saigoni mouichidodake warattemiaiEmbed
