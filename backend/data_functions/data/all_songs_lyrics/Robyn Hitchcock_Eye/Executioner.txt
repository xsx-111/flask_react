Executioner LyricsDon't wait up any longer
I'm not coming home
You know you're always stronger
When you're on you're own
You said the sweetest things
That's what you said
Here's a relationship
With a gun to its head
I'm the executioner of love
Our love has been found guilty
Our love is turning bad
Before I pass the sentence
Have you anything to add?
It wasn't easy but
It wasn't fun
But when you start these things
See what you've done
You're the executioner of love
You're the executioner
Your childhood is over
There's nowhere you can hide
There's nowhere you can hide
There's nowhere you can hide
It crawls towards you bleeding
Begging for a kiss
Even if you don't mean it
It's only just a kiss
I know how Judas felt
But he got paid
I'm doing this for free
Just like Live Aid
I'm the executioner of love
I'm the executioner of love
I'm the executioner of loveEmbed
