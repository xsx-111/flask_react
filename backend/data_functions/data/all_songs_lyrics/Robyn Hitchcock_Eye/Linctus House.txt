Linctus House LyricsYou know, I used to call my baby up, and we'd get real close, just like the telephone was a sofa
And our thoughts would mingle, and we'd leave our minds wide open, like a big window in the evening air, and we'd say:
"Hey baby, come on in and help yourself to my soul
Hey baby, come on in and help yourself to my soul"
But these days, even saying, "'Hello, How are you?' 'I'm fine, how are you?'" takes a lot of sweat
Ain't that a shame
Ain't that a shame
But in Linctus House
In my flesh hotel
I don't care anymore
You know, my baby and me, as Kimberley would say, we'd curl up like two dogs in front of a fire, and our eyes would reflect each other in the warm long heat of love
Yeah, the warm long heat of love
And I would hear the rain falling on the leaves outside
I couldn't stand to close the window 'cos I'd shiver if I left her side
But now I'd shake if we should meet And I spend most of my time in the bushes
Ain't that a shame
Know what you're doing
Ain't that a shame
Know what you've done
But in Linctus House
In my flesh hotel
I don't care anymore
'I understand how everything sometimes turns out to be nothing,' you say, but I wonder if you do
And if we understood each other, there'd be no need to talk. But even that, even talking is out of reach
Should I say it with flowers, or should I say it with nails?
I'm not the kind to push you around, but I don't want to make myself vulnerable
And if I was on my knees, you'd have a pretty good view of my skull, and I happen to know you're carrying a chisel
But in Linctus House
In my flesh hotel
I don't care anymore, no
In Linctus House
In my flesh hotel
I don't care
Ain't that a shame
Know what you're doing
Ain't that a shame
Know what you've doneEmbed
