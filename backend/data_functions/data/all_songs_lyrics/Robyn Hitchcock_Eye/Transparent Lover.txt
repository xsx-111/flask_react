Transparent Lover LyricsOn the horizon of the gulls and plovers
She saw the outline of transparent lovers
In a hotel room underneath the covers
Who should I see but the transparent lovers
Why is she built that way I soon discovered
Try to embrace her your transparent lover
Try to belong to her you won't recover
See your reflected in your transparent lover
Gone lord, gone, gone
Fade boy, fade
Gone lord, gone, gone
Faintly above the cliffs they held each other
One is the angels, the transparent lovers
Your going to lose her like you lost your mother
But you'll remember your transparent lover
All men are killers or they're killers brothers
I'm going to die for my transparent lover
My transparent lover
Gone lord, gone, gone
Fade boy, fade
Gone lord, gone, gone
Summery phantom as she fades she hovers
I'm going to find her my transparent lover
My transparent loverEmbed
