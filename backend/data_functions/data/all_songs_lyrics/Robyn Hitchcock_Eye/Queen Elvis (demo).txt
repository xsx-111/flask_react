Queen Elvis (demo) LyricsOne, two, three, four...
People get what they deserve
Time is round and space is curved
Honey, have you got the nerve
To be Queen Elvis?
See that man who mows his lawn
He'll hang in drag before the dawn
Some are made and some are born
To be Queen Elvis
It could break your mother's heart
It could break your sister's heart
Coming out's the hardest part
When you're Queen Elvis
Justify your special ways
Justify your special days
Gettin' blowjobs from the press
They're so easily impressed
Maybe that's why they're called the press
Queen Elvis
Oh and I'll sculpt you
So very hard
Oh and I'll sculpt you
'Til you bleed
Dynamos and floating heads
All the fragrance of the dead
Babbling beside the bed
Of Queen Elvis
Justify your special ways
Justify your special days
Two mirrors make infinity
In the mirror you and me
Find out just what love could be
Queen Elvis
Oh and I'll sculpt you
So very hard
Oh and I'll sculpt you
'Til you breatheEmbed
