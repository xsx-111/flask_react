Cynthia Mask LyricsNapoleon
Wore a black hat
Ate lots of chicken
And conquered half europe
Napoleon
Was caught by the British
Imprisoned on Elba
He died on the phone
Chamberlain
Came crawling from Munich
With one piece of paper
He waved at the camera
Peace in our time
Oh thank you, herr Hitler
Tell that to the Polish
Tell that to the Jews
You take your babes
Up to the bathroom
And then you lead
Them into the bedroom
Gnarly babes
For pleasure and profit
Correctly applied
Could bring good results
Cynthia mask
You're wearing a Cynthia mask
Cynthia mask
You're wearing a Cynthia mask
You're dressed as yourself
You walk down the pavement
You smile like a bowl
You grin like a melon
The people that pass
They think that they know you
They're too busy thinking
To see who you are
I'll reach your lungs
Like smoke in the orchard
Scattered in bushes
The firemen laughing
I'll rap your hands
With personal signals
Don't come to me later
Come to me now
Cynthia mask
You're wearing a Cynthia mask
Cynthia mask
Cynthia mask
I know how she feels
But can't say a word because
Nothing is real in here
Not even her
Disguise yourself
As you or another
A brick or a spider
In hunger and silence
The yawning cross
The hill full of pebbles
Inside you forever
Inside you is all
