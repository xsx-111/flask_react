Aquarium LyricsIn the aquarium
You stroked a greasy ray
Just at the end of day
Way down in Monterey
In the aquarium
The fish went through the trees
The planes went through the seas
And you were still with me
Everything revolves around the sun
You know I'm gonna miss you when I'm gone
Everything revolves
I never knew a thing about you
I never knew a thing about you
I headed in a dream towards you
I wonder if I ever saw you
But I never knew a thing about you
She says she's gonna saw her head off
She only does it for attention
Like other people I could mention
She wasn't feeling good to start with
You're not someone I want to part with
All you need is love
But all you get is afraid
Everything revolves around the sun
You know I'm gonna miss you when I'm gone
Everything revolvesEmbed
