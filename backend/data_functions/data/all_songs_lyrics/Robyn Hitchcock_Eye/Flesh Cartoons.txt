Flesh Cartoons LyricsLinda ryan
In the sky
I've seen her laughing
But i've never seen her cry
She took a fireman
It was a half empty flight
He brought his hose and
Everything just turned out right
I'm just watching
German leather
A german tongue
Lapping pleasure
When he's rubbery and young
He played the oboe
I thought he would
He does it better
Than a guitarist like me could
I'm just watching
Don't mind me
I'm just watching
On my own
Flesh cartoons
Flesh cartoons
Life is easy
Life goes by
Linda ryan
She's still up there in the sky
Thank you linda
She doesn't age
Despite the weather
She looks the same on every page
I'm just watching
Don't mind me
I'm just watching
On my own
I've got no feelings
I've got no friends
I've got insurance
And i despise those who pretend
Life's a movie
Life's a dream
I love you baby
Things are always what they seem
I'm just watching
Don't mind me
I'm just watching
On my own
