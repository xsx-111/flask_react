Sweet Ghost of Light LyricsSweet ghost of light
When you appear
You fall around me everywhere
I see your face
As you pass by
As fragile as a dragonfly
You jab me in
The kidneys like
A compass or an iron spike
But i can't help
Believing you
Because i love the things you do
Sweet ghost of light
I've lived too long
I'd die for you inside this song
The sweetest death
That i can dream
Like petals flowing down a stream
That turn to blood
As they dissolve
And it's all around you I revolve
Sweet ghost of light
You'll never fade
By nothing else are you betrayed
You fill me 'til
I'm empty and
You empty me like grains of sand
I love you more
Than anyone
Beneath the moon, beneath the sunEmbed
