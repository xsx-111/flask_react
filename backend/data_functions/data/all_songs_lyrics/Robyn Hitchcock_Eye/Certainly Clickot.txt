Certainly Clickot Lyrics(She's certainly clickot)
(She's certainly cruel)
She was tapering to a point
In a corona of foam
I had one chance to stop her eggs
Pronounced "eggs" or "brad"
But although inches from her column
I started falling out
Dover, get undressed, this
Car is parked with a sponge
A mind is a persuasive place
Especially when it's dark
She uncorked herself
Teeth spilling from her nostrils
Her handle inflated to fill
My hand just so
And in her breast pocket she wore
A fish named Angelo
Of which I have the duplicate, EricEmbed
