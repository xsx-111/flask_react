Raining Twilight Coast (demo) LyricsI'm on a raining twilight coast
Sending out postcards to the one I love
And the rain falls up from the ground
No one sees it 'cause there's no one around
Just one thing baby, you forgot my heart
And I remember when I was young
They said, "Work hard and die suddenly
Because it's fun."
And so I tried it -- I did what I could
Made no difference, never did any good
Just one thing baby, you forgot my heart
(Just one thing baby, you forgot my heart)
Just one thing baby, you forgot my heart
(Just one thing, gimme gimme one thing)
'Cause I'm a fish baby, with a shimmering skin
And I find an opening, and I slide right in
The sea is my mother, pea-green and wild
There's so many ways you can screw up a child
Just one thing baby, you forgot my heart
(Just one thing baby, you forgot my heart)
Just one thing baby, you forgot my heart
(Just one thing, gimme gimme one thing)
Just one thing baby (you forgot my heart
Just one thing, gimme gimme one thing)Embed
