Amazing Grace LyricsAmazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind but now i see
'Twas grace that taught
My heart to fear
And grace that fear relieved
How precious did
That grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers
Toils and snares
I have already come
'Twas grace that brought me
Safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
And when this heart
And flesh shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess
Within the vale
A life of joy and peaceEmbed
