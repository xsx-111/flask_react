Outta Me, Onto You LyricsNo no no no no no no no no no no no
No more
It's gonna be sudden
It's gonna be strange
I'm gonna turn on a dime
Give you 5 cents change
It's gonna be long
Overdue
It's all gonna come out
Out of me, on to you
Out of me
On to you
One of these days you're gonna push too hard
We'll go on like we've always done
Till you go too far
One of these days it's gonna reach the top
Then it's gonna start to spill
And it's not gonna stop
Out of me
On to you...
No more
Some people wear their smile like a disguise
Those people who smile a lot watch the eyes
I know cause i'm like that a lot
You think everything's okay
It is till it's not
Out of me
On to you...
No more
Some people wear their heart up on their sleeve
I wear mine underneath my right pant leg strapped to my boot
Don't think cause i'm easy i'm naive
Don't think i won't pull it out
Don't think i won't shoot
Out of me
On to you...
No more
Most people like to talk a lot
Including you
You know there isn't much i have to say
That i wouldn't rather just shut up and do
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna be torn
Just remember that i love you
Just remember you were warned
Out of me
On to you...
No more
