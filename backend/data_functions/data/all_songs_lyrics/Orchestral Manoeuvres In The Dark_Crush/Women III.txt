Women III Lyrics
It took a lot of reasoning
Before she got to pleasing him
She made a combination
Of despair and inspiration
A mother and a mistress
A sister to her sisters
A child who hoped her dreams come true
But now she's only stuck with you

At least she has a home to share
A man who comes to do her hair
A garden with a patio
A place to have a barbecue
The envy of her neighbours
Who smile and wave and ask her
If they could live for just a day
In luxury and ecstasy

But it's a long way home
From where she's come
It's a long way back
Too much to ask
The trash is in the garbage can
The mystery of Wonderland
One day she thinks of leaving him
The next she treats him like a king
She hears it on the radio
Sees it on the video
She waits until the kids have grown
And then she thinks she'll start again

But it's a long way home
From where she's come
And it's a long way back
Too much to ask

Before she gave her friends a ring
She promised almost everything
They ran away to paradise
But everything will have its price
From woman number one
To woman number two
Now she's woman number three
And she thinks that she is lucky
But it's a long way home
From where she's come
And it's a long way back
Too much to ask
