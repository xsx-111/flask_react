The Lights Are Going Out Lyrics
There's a painting on the wall
That wasn't there at all
Ten minutes ago
There's a girl who walks the line
She's with you all the time
She won't let go

And I can't see me with another girl
As everything slows down across the world

The lights are going out
One by one
Across the world
With faces turning down
The night will hide the sound
She comes to you

I can't see me with another girl
As everything slows down across the world

In a harbour safe from storm
She waits for darkened forms
She's seen you there
Time and time again
You hear her call your name
She calls for you
I can't see me with another girl
As everything slows down across the world
As everything slows down across the world

The lights are going out
One by one
Across the world
(The lights are going out
One by one)
The lights are going out
One by one
Across the worldEmbed
