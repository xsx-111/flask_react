Bloc Bloc Bloc Lyrics
I want to go up to Detroit
I want to lie in the shade
I want to visit the President
And then I want to get laid

I want to go down to Memphis
I want to talk to the King
I want to tell him we're sorry
And it won't happen again

I've got a photo of James Joyce
(I've got a photo of James Joyce)
It's a photo by Man Roy
(It's a photo by Man Ray)
It's not very very much like him
(Not really much like him)
But it's not for me to say
(I wouldn't dare to say)

She sacrifices her body
(She sacrifices her body)
Almost every night
(Almost every night)
Just like a lamb to the slaughter
(Like a lamb to the slaughter)
And she thinks it makes him feel right
(She makes him feel alright)
You give me so many problems
(So many problems)
You make me crash in my car
(You make me crash in my car)
I'll have a martini cocktail
(I'll have one more cocktail)
And then we'll see where we are
(You'll know just where we are)

So just be nice to your brother
(So just be nice to your brother)
I'll take your sister to bed
(I'll take your sister to bed)
I'll bloc bloc bloc till the weekend
(Bloc bloc bloc till the weekend)
But you'd better come back soon
(Please come back)Embed
