La Femme Accident Lyrics
La femme accident's
Got everything you want
You never have to know
You never have to show
She's hanging on your every word

She clings to your heart
She won't let you depart
Oh this is mine
But she's with you all the time
She's crying like a fragile child

But if you get to know her
She's not a little girl
And if she gets to know you
You can't escape her world

La femme accident
A woman full of want
Her heart's on the line
You haven't got the time
She suffers like some Joan of Arc
She says there's just no justice
In this world
She's paradise for a day

La femme accident
What reason could you want
Just use her and turn away
La femme accident's
Got everything you want
She's paradise for a dayEmbed
