The Native Daughters of the Golden West Lyrics
The native daughters of the golden west

In ecstasy they cry to know
If their parents' love will let them grow
Their mother's pride, their father's joy
They thank the stars that they're not boys

The native daughters of the golden west
Their beauty is priceless
You'll never pass their test

As children do they stayed at home
Waiting for the day when they were grown
The future seemed so far away
But every night they'd kneel and pray

But all in all they did their best
And one by one they left the nest
Across the globe they searched for love
And put their faith in their God above
The native daughters of the golden west
They're made out of light
We never would have guessed

So by and by their dreams came true
They fell in love with boys they knew
Their children grew fed from the breast
Of the native daughters of the golden west

The native daughters of the golden west
They talk all day
But we were not impressed
The native daughters of the golden west
They're sisters of mercy
They'll grant your last request1Embed
