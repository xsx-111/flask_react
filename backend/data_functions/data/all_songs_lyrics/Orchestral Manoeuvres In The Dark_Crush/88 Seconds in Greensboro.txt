88 Seconds in Greensboro Lyrics
Eighty-eight seconds
Is all it takes
Eighty-eight seconds
Don't make mistakes
We've seen you
We can see you

In red and blue
In black and white
Under crystal skies
In full daylight
You know it
God you know it

Eighty-eight seconds (Eighty-eight seconds)
Is all it takes
In eighty-eight seconds
We don't make mistakes
We know you
Oh yes we have known you

Times are changing
But not in our street
Once we played there
Like the good times
You know it
God you know it
They're heading for
A shallow grave
With a big black cross
By a tall white house
To a place down south
We won't forget
To be stabbed in the back
By a man they met

In eighty-eight seconds
In Greensboro
Eighty-eight seconds
In eighty-eight seconds
In Greensboro
Eighty-eight seconds
Eighty-eight seconds
In Greensboro
In eighty-eight seconds
In Greensboro
Eighty-eight seconds
In Greensboro
Is all we take
Is all we takeEmbed
