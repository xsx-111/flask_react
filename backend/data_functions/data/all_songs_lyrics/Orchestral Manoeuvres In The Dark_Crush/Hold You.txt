Hold You Lyrics
To hold you
Love you
See you smile at the break of day
To touch you
Know you
Want you by me when you're far away

It's easy to say
But hard to do
When you're in love
With some foolish child
And everybody
Just can't understand
They say, see him, watch him
He will change his mind

But I see you
Want him
You're always with him when the lights go down
You need him
Love him
He promises he'll always stay around
It's easy for me
When the daylight's here
It's easy to be happy
When I'm in the crowd
But maybe someday
I could take his place
I want you, need you
I won't change my mind

But he holds you
Loves you
He has you with him at the break of day
He'll touch you
Know you
Wants you by him though you're far away

If all these things you say are true
There's just one thing I need to know
Is this love or lies, just a flame or a fire?
There's something I need and only you can help

To hold you
Love you
See you smile at the break of day
To touch you
Know you
Want you by me when you're far away
To hold you
Love you
Have you with me when the lights go down
To see you
Need you
Promise me you'll always stay aroundEmbed
