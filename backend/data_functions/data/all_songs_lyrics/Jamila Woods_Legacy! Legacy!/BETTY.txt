BETTY Lyrics
Oh, I'm different, I'm a cup of mild sauce
Sweet tongue, but don't get me in a paper cut
I'll fight you with my eyes, oh, when they call me shy
They just frightened of what's in my mind
These great greats won't let me lie
Midnight eyes wide feels like I'm at the riverside
Great greats come down, they whisper to me quiet
"I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive"

I am not your typical girl
Throw away that picture in your head
I am not your typical girl
Work harder now, work harder

Running from myself, I come undone
I wait, I try
Falling for myself
It's taken time to know I'm mine

Oh, I am different, I am different
I am, I am
What is it with you independent men? It's always something
Threatening your masculine energy, you think it's fleeting
Nothing you ain't give to me I can take away from you now
Let me be, I'm trying to fly, you insist on clipping my wings

Running from myself, I come undone
I wait, I try
Falling for myself
It's taken time to know I'm mine

Curl in the middle of my forehead, I'm bad
Take a picture if you want me quiet, I said
Sweet like the candy in Joycetta's purse on Sunday
But I'm bitter when you try to hold me back2Embed
