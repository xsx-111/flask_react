FRIDA Lyrics
If I run, run, run, would you, you, you, come see, see, see me?
'Cause I’m not the one to sit sit up here just waiting
If I run, run, run, would you, you, you come see, see, see me?
'Cause I'm not the one to sit sit up here just waiting

I like you better when you see me less
I like me better when I’m not so stressed
We could do it like Frida, we could build a bridge then
I could come see ya, just not where I live
Don't get me wrong, I'm not scared of lovin' ya
Multiply my sides, I need a lot of area
A savior is not what I'm seeking
I'm god enough and you be believing
In miracles in a city so cold
You're the holy book I can lay my hands on
You're the holy book I can lay my hands on
You’re the holy book I can lay my hands on

If I run, run, would you, you, you see, see, see me?
If I run, run, would you, you, you see, see, see me?

I like you better when you see me less
I like me better when I’m not so stressed
We could do it like Frida, we could build a bridge then
I could come see ya
We could do it like Frida, I could build a bridge then
I could come see ya
We could do it like Frida, we could build a bridge then
I could come see ya
We could do it like Frida, we could build a bridge then
I could come see ya
If I run, run, would you, you, you see, see, see
If I run, run, would you, you, you see, see, see me?
If I run, run, would you, you, you see, see, see me?
If I run, run, would you, you, you see, see, see me?Embed
