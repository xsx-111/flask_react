BALDWIN Lyrics
You don't know a thing about our story, tell it wrong all the time
Don’t know a thing about our glory, wanna steal my baby's shine

All my friends
Wanna know why you ain't figured it out just yet
All my friends
Been readin’ the books by Morrison and West
All my friends
Wanna know why you ain't figured it out just yet
All my friends
Been readin' the books, readin' the books you ain't read

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Somebody's daddy always laid out on the street
And for what?
We're on the street
And for what?
Your precious lethal fear
Your precious lethal fear
You could change a hood just by showing your face
Condo climbing high, now the block is erased
(You don't get it, get it)
You clutch on your purse, now you crossing the street
Brother caught your eye, now you callin’ police
(You don’t get it, get it)
It's a casual violence in your speech and your silence
It’s unnatural science, you too comfortable lying

We don't go out
Can't wish us away
We been burning
Brighter everyday
We don't go out
Can’t wish us away
We been burning
Brighter everyday

You don't know a thing about our story, tell it wrong all the time
Don't know a thing about our glory, wanna steal my baby's shine

All my friends
Think I should love you anyway
My friend James
Says I should love you anyway
And that's okay
But ooh, yeah
You're making it hard for me
Ooh, you're making it so hard
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

We don't go out
Can't wish us away
We been burning
Brighter everyday
We don't go out
Can't wish us away
We been burning
Brighter everyday

You don't know a thing about our story, tell it wrong all the time
Don't know a thing about our glory, wanna steal my baby's shine

All my friends
Wanna know why you ain't figured it out just yet
All my friends
Been readin' the books by Morrison and West
All my friends
Wanna know why you ain't figured it out just yet
All my friends
Been readin' the books, readin' the books you ain't read
Readin' the books you ain't read
Readin' the books you ain't read
Readin' the books you ain't readEmbed
