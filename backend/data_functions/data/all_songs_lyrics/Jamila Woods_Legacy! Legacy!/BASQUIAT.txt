BASQUIAT Lyrics
They wanna see me angry
They wanna see me bear my teeth, yeah
I'm a stovetop, baby
I smile in your face, but the oven’s on high
(Don't get burned)
I told you that I meant it
I'm reclusive, I sleuthed it
I already know what you’re thinkin' 'bout me

(Are you mad?) Yes, I'm mad
(What make you mad?) I don't fuckin' know
You should tell me so, you done done it
(Ooh-ah, ooh-ah)
(Are you mad?) Yes, I'm mad
(What make you mad?) I can't recall
I plead the fifth, writing’s on the wall
(Ooh-ah, ooh-ah)

After, after all
These teeth are not employed
You can’t police my joy, no
After, after all
My smile is not employed
You can't police my joy, no
They wanna see me angry
They wanna see me bear my teeth, yeah
I’m a stovetop, baby
I smile in your face, but the oven's on high
(Don't get burned)
I told you that I meant it
I'm reclusive, I sleuthed it
I already know what you’re thinkin' 'bout me

(Are you mad?) Yes, I'm mad
(What make you mad?) I don't fuckin' know
You should tell me so, you done done it
(Ooh-ah, ooh-ah)
(Are you mad?) Yes, I'm mad
(What make you mad?) I can't recall
I plead the fifth, writing's on the wall
(Ooh-ah, ooh-ah)

After, after all
Teeth-teeth are not employed
You can't police my joy, no
After, after all
These, not em-not employed
You can't police my joy, no
Yeah, can't police my
Can't tell me when to release my (Soul)
What you looked into and didn't find (Soul)
Brought up the same news the last time (Soul)
I was in hidin', that was just private, that was dear diary
Why you entitled? Why are you pryin'?
Say I'm too quiet, watch how they gon' flip it
That's not how I meant it, but that's how they write it
I'ma hear about it in a written column
If they gon' misquote me, what's the point in talkin'?
It is not promotion
Only nonsense and it's not important
Not headlinin', I was unimportant, I didn't talk about it
I don't talk about it, but that's how I like it
I don't go outside so much they don't invite me
Interview or not, there's no need for the spyin'
(Are you mad?) Yes, I'm mad
Yes, I'm Black, no I don't elaborate
I said all that I had to say
No, you ain't got the answers, sway
No human is an accolade
Want me dreadlocked and tatted faced
That's the story they'll gravitate
Stovetop, they want what I don't got
Devil's advocate, I saw them play both sides
That's the line they'll cross for exposure
Recluse, reluctant to share most times
After, after all
These teeth are not employed
You can't police my joy
After, after all
My smile is not employed
You can't police my joy
After, after all
These teeth are not employed
You can't police my joy
After, after all
My smile is not employed
You can't police my joy

After
(It's like you want me to be)
(You're tryin' to provoke me)
After all
(This shit hereditary)
(The pressure rising, rising)
These teeth are not employed
(Some days I'm almost carefree)
(Some days I wish I could be)
You can't police my joy
(So many women in me)
(You beggars can't be choosy)
After
(It's like you want me to be)
(You're tryin' to provoke me)
After all
(This shit hereditary)
(The pressure rising, rising)
My smile is not employed
You can't police my joy
(So many women in me)
(You beggars can't be choosy)
(After)
It's like you want me to be
You're tryin' to provoke me
(After all)
This shit hereditary
The pressure rising, rising
(These teeth are not employed)
Some days I'm almost carefree
Some days I wish I could be
(You can't police my joy)
So many women in me
You beggars can't be choosy
(After)
It's like you want me to be
You're tryin' to provoke me
(After all)
This shit hereditary
The pressure rising, rising
(My smile is not employed)
Some days I'm almost carefree
Some days I wish I could be
(You can't police my joy)
So many women in me
You beggars can't be choosy
It's like you want me to be
You're tryin' to provoke me
This shit hereditary
The pressure rising, rising
Some days I'm almost carefree
Some days I wish I could be
So many women in me
You beggars can't be choosy
It's like you want me to be
You're tryin' to provoke me
This shit hereditary
The pressure rising, rising
Some days I'm almost carefree
Some days I wish I could be
So many women in me
You beggars can't be choosy
It's like you want me to be
You're tryin' to provoke me
This shit hereditary
The pressure rising, rising
Some days I'm almost carefree
Some days I wish I could be
So many women in me
You beggars can't be choosy7Embed
