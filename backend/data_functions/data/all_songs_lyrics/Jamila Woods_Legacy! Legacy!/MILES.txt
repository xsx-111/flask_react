MILES Lyrics
What you call it when I'm winning?
Need to find some other words for how I spin it
Make 'em lean in when I'm speakin'
Turn my back, it make 'em mad, it's not my business
You wanna get what you want when you want it?
Well, you should go to old country
'Cause in the old country
You could make me tap dance, shake hands, yes ma'am
But I'm a free man now and

I do
What I do
Not for you
Not for you (Not for you)

I gave you the cool
I could do it in my sleep
Seven days out of the week
It's a cake, oh, it's a breeze
You can't fake the cool
I could do it in my sleep
Seven days out of the week
It's a cake, oh, it's a breeze, hey
Don't call me legend 'til I kick the bucket
Never could define me, so fuck it
I shed sounds like snakeskin, style like chameleon
Wanna cage me
But you can find me in the garden
Growin' like a weed
Oh, it's a curse, but

I do
What I do
Not for you
Not for you (Not for you)

I gave you the cool
I could do it in my sleep
Seven days out of the week
It's a cake, oh, it's a breeze
You can't fake the cool
I could do it in my sleep
Seven days out of the week
It's a cake, oh, it's a breeze, hey

Shut up, motherfucker
I don't take requests
Blessed be my lovers
I'm not like the rest
I'm bad like my mother
So don't disrespect
There'll never be another
I'm better than your best
I'm better, I'm better than your best
I'm better, I'm better than your best
I'm better, I'm better than your best
I'm better than yourâ€”Embed
