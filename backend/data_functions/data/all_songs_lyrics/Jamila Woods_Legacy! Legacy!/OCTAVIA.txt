OCTAVIA Lyrics
Don't ever let a textbook scare you
You the missing piece, OG technology, they stole you
Don't ever let 'em knock the way you talk
The language you evolve your natural genius
Merch it

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I'm the truth, I am a fact
They lie on me, I have to laugh
I write it down, it happens next
So be it, see to it
(Their science is a-lyin' on me and you
That don't make it true)
I'm the truth, I am a fact
They lie on me, I have to laugh
I write it down, it happens next
So be it, see to it
(Their science is a-lyin' on me and you
That don't make it true)

(Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It used to be the worst crime to write a line
Our great great greats risked their lives, learned letters fireside
Like a seat on a bus, like a heel in a march
Like we holdin' a torch, it's our inheritance
They tease our pronunciations then try to mimic our greatness
We are a precious creation, our black has no imitation

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I'm the truth, I am a fact
They lie on me, I have to laugh
I write it down, it happens next
So be it, see to it
(Their science is a-lyin' on me and you
That don't make it true)
I'm the truth, I am a fact
They lie on me, I have to laugh
I write it down, it happens next
So be it, see to it
(Their science is a-lyin' on me and you
That don't make it true)Embed
