EARTHA Lyrics
I used to be afraid of myself
Hung my smile on a shelf
Hid my teeth when I laughed
Now I'm far too grown for your plot, for your palm
Will you root for me or will you leave?

I don’t wanna compromise
Can we make it through the night?
I'm trying to see eye to eye
But you look right over me
Your words stuck on repeat
And I'm tired of you

How many times do I sit and listen to you?
I don’t know why I keep sittin', listenin' to you
How many times do I sit and listen to you?
I don't know why I keep sittin', listenin' to you
How many times do I sit and listen to you?
I don't know why I keep sittin', listenin’ to you
How many times do I sit and listen to you?
I don’t know why I keep sittin', listenin’ to you
How many times do I sit and listen to you?
I don't know why I keep sittin', listenin' to you
It’s not that I'm bored
I just heard it before
The space you take up
The curve of your learning
That's my labor, my love
Explaining myself again
I coulda run a mile instead
I coulda twist my ends instead
I'm laid out in bed
Gaslight in my head
But I said what I said

I don't wanna compromise
Can we make it through the night?
I'm trying to see eye to eye
But you look right over me
Your words stuck on repeat
And I'm tired of your shit

Who gonna share my love for me with me?
Who gonna share my love for me with me?
Who gonna share my love for me with me? With me? Yeah
Who gonna share my love for me with me?
Who gonna share my love for me with me?
Who gonna share my love for me with me?
Who gonna share my love?3Embed
