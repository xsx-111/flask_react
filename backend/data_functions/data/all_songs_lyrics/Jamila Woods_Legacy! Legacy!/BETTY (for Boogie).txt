BETTY (for Boogie) Lyrics
I am not your typical girl
Throw away that picture in your head
I am not your typical girl
Work harder, now, work harder
I am not your typical girl
(Running from myself)
Throw away that picture in your head
(I come undone)
I am not your typical girl
(Running from myself)
Work harder, now, work harder
(I come undone)

Work, work
Work, work

Oh, I'm different, I'm a cup of mild sauce
Sweet tongue, but don't get me in a paper cut
I'll fight you with my eyes, oh, when they call me shy
They just frightened of what's in my mind (Mind)
These great-greats won't let me lie
Midnight eyes wide feels like I'm at the riverside
Great greats come down, they whisper to me quiet
"I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive"
I am not your typical girl
Throw away that picture in your head
I am not your typical girl
Work harder, now, work harder
I am not your typical girl
(Running from myself)
Throw away that picture in your head
(I come undone)
I am not your typical girl
(Running from myself)
Work harder, now, work harder
(I come undone)

Work, work
Work, work

What is it with you independent men?
It's always something
Threatening your masculine
Energy, you think it's fleeting
Nothing you ain't give to me
I can take away from you now
Let me be, I'm trying to fly, you
Insist on clipping my wings
I am not your typical girl
(Running from myself)
Throw away that picture in your head
(I come undone)
I am not your typical girl
(Running from myself)
Work harder, now, work harder
(I come undone)
I am not your typical girl
(Running from myself)
Throw away that picture in your head
(I come undone)
I am not your typical girl
(Running from myself)
Work harder, now, work harder
(I come undone)

Running from myself
I come undone
I wait, I tryEmbed
