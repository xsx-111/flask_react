ZORA Lyrics
Must be disconcerting how I discombob' your mold
I've always been the only, every classroom, every home
Kiss of chocolate on the moon, collard greens and silver spoon
Little boxes on the hillside, little boxes you can't stick unto me
My weaponry is my energy
I tenderly fill my enemies with white light

You will never know everything, everything
I will never know everything, everything
You will never know everything, everything
And you don't know me so you up the creek
You will never know everything, everything
I will never know everything, everything
You will never know everything, everything
And you don't know me, couldn't possibly

Oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, oh, I, oh, I
Oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, I, oh, I
Oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, I, oh, I
Oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, I

None of us are free but some of us are brave
I dare you to shrink my wave, I'm on a new plane
I'm all out of fucks to give, yeah
Fear ain't no way to live, yeah
Must be disconcerting how I discombob' your mold
I've always been the only, you're so unoriginal
Your words don't leave scars, believe me, I've heard them all
I may be small, I may speak soft, but you can see the change in the water
Oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, oh, I, oh, I
Oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, I, oh, I
Oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, I, oh, I
Oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, I

You will never know everything, everything
I will never know everything, everything
You will never know everything, everything
And you don't know me so you up the creek
You will never know everything, everything
I will never know everything, everything
You will never know everything, everything
And you don't know me, couldn't possibly2Embed
