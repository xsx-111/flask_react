MUDDY Lyrics
Motherfuckers won't shut up
We been in a war, my God
Some country shit won't cut it
He need the blues he could plug in
Motherfuckers like him now
He give 'em something to cry about
Permission to feel again
He used to play and everybody said
Everybody said

He can shake the fire out
He can shake the fire out
He can shake the fire out
He can shake the fire out
He can shake the fire out
He can shake the fire out
He can shake the fire out
He can shake the fire out

Oh, you stole my name
Now you're just a phony
You're shootin' for the stars
I'd rather stay muddy
They can study my fingers
They can mirror my pose
They can talk your good ear off
On what they think they know, they think they know
They say now more than ever, I think they forget
What our history is
What we do, what we made

We can shake the fire out
We can shake the fire out
We can shake the fire out
We can shake the fire out
They try to shake the fire out
They can't shake the fire out
We can shake the fire out
I bet they'll shake the fire out

Like me (We can shake the fire out)
Oh, like me
Like me (We can shake the fire out)
Oh no
Like me (We can shake the fire out)
Oh, like me
Like me (They can shake the fire out)
Oh, oh, not like me
Hoo, hoo2Embed
