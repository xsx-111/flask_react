SUN RA Lyrics
I'm a fable, you and me
We should leave this planet to our enemies
Got a solar system in my bee-dee-bees
And my twist out shittin' on gravity
I'm unstable, heavy star
All the crosshairs pointing up to where we are
I'm a bad one baby, I'm a warrior
Never let them shame me out of my anger
I just gotta get away from the Earth, man
This marble was doomed from the start and
I won't be around to see it when it goes
Black girl Garvey, I'll be on my own

My wings are greater than walls
My wings are greater
My wings are greater than walls
My wings are greater
My wings are greater than walls
My wings are greater
My wings are greater than walls

Come with me, get this air
Our heaven could be right here
(My wings are greater)
Come with me, get this air
Our heaven could be right here
(My wings are greater than walls)
I'm unable to shake these thoughts
Crawled to the altar, pride wouldn't let me walk
Old news sitting on my weary heart
I should let this go, I don't know where we'd start
Fuck yo labels, I still talk to God
Vision still clear in my broke mirror
Tell 'em stand clear of the whole damn tribe
Black boys different shades but we too damn dark for y'all
Since a little one knew I was a martian
Government trying to stop us from departing
I'm done begging for pardons, our planet's uncharted
Wearing durags at Harvard, dissertation on Martin
Just to piss y'all off
Just to piss y'all off

My wings are greater than walls
My wings are greater
My wings are greater than walls
My wings are greater
My wings are greater than walls
My wings are greater
My wings are greater than walls

Come with me, get this air
Our heaven could be right here
(My wings are greater)
Come with me, get this air
Our heaven could be right here
(My wings are greater than walls)
Come with me, get this air
Our heaven could be right here
(My wings are greater)
Come with me, get this air
Our heaven could be right here
(My wings are greater than walls)
My wings are greater than walls
My wings are greater than1Embed
