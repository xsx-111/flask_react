10 miles Lyrics
To die in your arms
Your words forming again
We kiss very hard and wild
To rise in the dark
Like birds preying on skin
We prey with our oxygen

Jo, nothing is real
We still have that feel
You're closing up the bar
I'm warming up the car
Ten miles away

Two children of ours
They came twirling in
We laughed very hard for a while
But they've grown very far and tall
How we miss them
Though happy they're traveling

Jo, nothing is real
But we still have that feel
You're closing up the bar
I'm warming up the car
Ten miles away
We set no alarm
Eyes wide, 6 A.M
Wake up on the farm
Slowly walk to the barn
Horse feed, you take the yarn
I'll read, I'll read

Jo, nothing is real
But we still have that feel
You're closing up the bar
I'm warming up the car
Ten miles away

To die in your arms
Your words forming againEmbed
