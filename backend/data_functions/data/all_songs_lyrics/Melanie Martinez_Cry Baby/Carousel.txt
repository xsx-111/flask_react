Carousel Lyrics
'Round and around like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

Come, come one come all
You must be this tall
To ride this ride, at the carnival
Oh, come take my hand
And run through playland
So high, too high, at the carnival

And it's all fun and games
Till somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket
And there's no turning back now

'Round and around like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
This horse is too slow
We're always this close
Almost, almost
We're a freak show
Right, right when I'm near
It's like you disappear
Where'd you go?
Mr. Houdini, you're a freak show

And it's all fun and games
Till somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket
And there's no turning back now

'Round and around like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

Why did you steal my cotton candy heart?
You threw it in this damn coin slot
And now I'm stuck, oh, I'm stuck
Riding, riding, riding
'Round and around like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel67Embed
