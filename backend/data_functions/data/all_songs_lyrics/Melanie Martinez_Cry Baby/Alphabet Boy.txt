Alphabet Boy Lyrics
Ah ah ah, buh-buh-buh-buh
Ah ah ah, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh
Ah ah ah, buh-buh-buh-buh
Buh-buh-buh-buh, buh-buh-buh
Buh-buh-buh-buh

Always aiming paper airplanes at me when you're around
You build me up like building blocks just so you can bring me down
You can crush my candy cane but you'll never catch me cry
If you dangle that diploma and I dead, you don't be surprised

I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy

I'm not a little kid now, watch me get big now
Spell my name on a fridge now, with all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now, but are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground, little alphabet boy

Ah ah ah, buh-buh-buh-buh
Ah ah ah, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh
Ah ah ah, buh-buh-buh-buh
Buh-buh-buh-buh, buh-buh-buh
Buh-buh-buh-buh
Apples aren't always appropriate apologies
Butterscotch and bubblegum drops are bittersweet to me
You call me a child while you keep counting all your coins
But you're not my daddy and I'm not your dolly
And your dictionary's destroyed

I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy

I'm not a little kid now, watch me get big now
Spell my name on a fridge now, with all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now, but are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground, little alphabet boy

Alphabet boy, oh, alphabet boy
Alphabet boy, alphabet boy
My alphabet boy, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I'm not a little kid now, watch me get big now
Spell my name on a fridge now, with all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now, but are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground, little alphabet boy
(Ah-ah-ah, buh-buh-buh-buh)

Alphabet boy
(Ah-ah-ah, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh)
(Ah ah ah, buh-buh-buh-buh)
(Buh-buh-buh-buh, buh-buh-buh)
(Buh-buh-buh-buh)
