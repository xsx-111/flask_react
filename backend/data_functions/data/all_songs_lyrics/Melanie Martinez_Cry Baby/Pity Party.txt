Pity Party Lyrics
Did my invitations disappear?
Why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter?
Tell me why the hell no one is here
Tell me what to do to make it all feel better

Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
Forever, forever

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

Maybe if I knew all of them well
I wouldn't have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
Maybe if I casted out a spell
Or told them decorations were in pastel ribbons
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
Forever, forever

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

I'm laughin', I'm cryin'
It feels like I'm dyin'
I'm laughin', I'm cryin'
It feels like I'm dyin'
I'm laughin', I'm cryin'
It feels like I'm dyin'
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to (If I want to, If I want to)
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry)81Embed
