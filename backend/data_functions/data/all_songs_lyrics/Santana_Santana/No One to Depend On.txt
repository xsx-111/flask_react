No One to Depend On LyricsI ain't got nobody that I can depend on
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on
I ain't got no one (no tengo a nadie)
That I know of (no tengo a nadie)
That I can depend on (no tengo a nadie)
I ain't got no one (no tengo a nadie)
That I know of (no tengo a nadie)
That I can depend on (no tengo a nadie)
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on (no tengo a nadie)
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on (no tengo a nadie)Embed
