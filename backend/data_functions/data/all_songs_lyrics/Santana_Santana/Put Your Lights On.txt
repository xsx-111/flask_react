Put Your Lights On LyricsHey now, all you sinners
Put your lights on, put your lights on
Hey now, all you lovers
Put your lights on, put your lights on
Hey now, all you killers
Put your lights on, put your lights on
Hey now, all you children
Leave your lights on
You better leave your lights on
Because there's a monster
Living under my bed
Whispering in my ear
There's an angel
With her hand on my head
She say I got nothing to fear
There's a darkness
Living deep in my soul
It's still got a purpose to serve
So let your light shine
Deep into my home
God, don't let me lose my nerve
Don't let me lose my nerve
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Whoa, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now all you sinners
Put your lights on, put your lights on
Hey now, all you children
Leave your lights on
You better leave your lights on
Because there's a monster
Living under my bed
Whispering in my ear
And there's an angel
With her hand on my head
She say I got nothing to fear
She says, "La ilaha illa Allah
You all shine like stars
La ilaha illa Allah
You all shine like stars
And we fade away"1Embed
