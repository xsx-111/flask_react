Words Lyrics
Three inches above the floor
Man in a box wants to burn my soul
And I'm tired
"Is that the truth?" he says
The pain is easy
Too many words, too many words

And I can hear 'em
And I can hear 'em
And I can hear 'em, I can hear 'em
And I can hear 'em

If you're hearing screams
Come back child, come back
My hands are dry
But I know they're gonna make it just one more night
Too many words, too many words

And I can hear 'em
And I can hear 'em
And I can hear 'em, I can hear 'em
And I can hear 'em

And I can hear 'em
And I can hear 'em
And I can hear 'em, I can hear 'em
And I can hear 'em2Embed
