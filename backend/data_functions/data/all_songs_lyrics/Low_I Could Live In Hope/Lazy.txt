Sarah, Sarah, you're lazy
It's not enough
It's not enough
She says there's not enough for two
It's not enough
It's not enough
It's not enough for two
Sarah, Sarah, you're lazy
Sarah, Sarah, you're lazy
Sarah, Sarah, you're lazy
Sarah, Sarah, you're lazy
Sarah, Sarah, you're lazy
Sarah, Sarah, you're lazyEmbed
