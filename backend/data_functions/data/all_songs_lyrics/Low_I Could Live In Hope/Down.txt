Down LyricsI guess the secret's out
Like a river flow
It's never over done
Out of control
I guess my secret's out
My simple goal
You'll be the one, too
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of my control
Out of control
I guess the secret's out
Above me looking down, down, down
It's not supposed to be that way
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
