Cut Lyrics
Jesse's gone inside out
Someone hush her quiet mouth
Charity's friend she was I know
Fill her cup and leave her alone

Distance fails but it keeps her alive
Thinks that evil's on her side
Gets rid of things that don't matter
She used to let me cut her hair
She used to let me cut her hair
She used to let me cut her hair

Jesse's gone inside out
She used to let me cut her hairEmbed
