Drag LyricsI'm sorry but I can't hold on
It works much better if I let it drag me around
I'm sorry if I'm losing ground
It works much better if I let it drag me around
Drag me around
Drag me around
Drag me
I'm sorry but I can't hold on
It works much better if I let it drag me around
Drag me around
Drag me around
And round and round and round and round and round
And round and round and round and round and round
And round and round and round and round and roundEmbed
