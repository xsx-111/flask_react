Bored in the USA Lyrics
How many people rise and say
"My brain's so awfully glad to be here for yet another mindless day
Now, I've got all morning to obsessively accrue
A small nation of meaningful objects and they've gotta represent me too
By this afternoon, I'll live in debt
And by tomorrow, be replaced by children?"

How many people rise and think
"Oh good, the stranger's body's still here, our arrangement hasn't changed
Now, I've got a lifetime to consider all the ways
I grow more disappointing to you
As my beauty warps and fades
And I suspect you feel the same
When I was young, I dreamt of a passionate obligation to a roommate?"

Is this the part where I get all I ever wanted?
Who said that?
Can I get my money back?

Just a little bored in the USA
Oh, just a little bored in the USA
Save me, white Jesus
Bored in the USA
Oh, they gave me a useless education
And a subprime loan on a craftsman home
Keep my prescriptions filled
And now I can't get off
But I can kind of deal
Oh, with being

Bored in the USA
Oh, just a little bored in the USA
Save me, President Jesus
I'm bored in the USA
How did it happen?
