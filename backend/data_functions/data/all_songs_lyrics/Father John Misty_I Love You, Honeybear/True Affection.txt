True Affection Lyrics
When can we talk with a face?
Instead of using all these strange devices
Seems like you and I need to have a crazy conversation

Wouldn't be that hard, get along so well
Sentence by sentence
It's a trial run, let me show you how
Figure I can give you true affection

True affection, true affection (oh, oh)
True affection, true affection (oh, oh)


When can we talk with a face?
Instead of using all these strange devices
(True affection)
Seems like you and I need to have a crazy conversation
(True affection)
When can we talk with a face?
Figure I can give you true affection
(True affection)
Seems like you and I need to have a crazy conversation
(True affection)
When can we talk with a face?
Figure I can give you true affection3Embed
