Strange Encounter Lyrics
You'll only ever be the girl who just almost died in my house
Half naked, looking through your telephone
Run you a bath and try hard not to freak out

So free and too easy
Giving it away, giving it away
It's not cheap but here I am
Giving it away, giving it away, giving it away

Don't be my, don't be my, don't be my last strange encounter
The moment you came to, I swore I would change
Though neither one of us would leave unscathed
At least we'll both go on living

Wanna find somebody
But not like this
Yeah, I'm a decent person
Just a little aimless

So free and too easy
Giving it away, giving it away
It's not cheap but here I am
Giving it away, giving it away, giving it away
Don't be my, don't be my, don't be my last strange encounter
The moment you came to, I swore I would change
Though neither one of us would leave unscathed
At least we'll both go on living7Embed
