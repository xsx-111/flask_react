Holy Shit Lyrics
Ancient holy wars
Dead religions, holocausts
New regimes, old ideas
That's now myth, that's now real
Original sin, genetic fate
Revolutions, spinning plates
It's important to stay informed
The commentary to comment on

Oh, and no one ever really knows you
And life is brief
So I've heard, but what's that gotta do with
This black hole in me?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Age-old gender roles
Infotainment, capital
Golden boughs and mercury
Bohemian nightmare
Dust-bowl chic
This documentary's lost on me
Satirical news, free energy
Mobile lifestyle, loveless sex
Independence, happiness
Oh, and no one ever knows the real you
And life is brief
So I've heard, but what's that gotta do with
This atom bomb in me?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Colosseum families
The golden era of TV
Eunuch sluts, consumer slaves
A rose by any other name
Carbon footprint, incest dreams
Fuck the mother in the green
Planet cancer, sweet revenge
Isolation, online friends

Oh, and love is just an institution based on human frailty
What's your paradise gotta do with Adam and Eve?
Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity
What I fail to see is what that's gotta do
With you and me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh16Embed
