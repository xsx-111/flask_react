Chateau Lobby #4 (in C for Two Virgins) Lyrics
Emma eats bread and butter
Like a queen would have ostrich and cobra wine
We’ll have Satanic Christmas Eve
And play piano in the Chateau lobby

I’ve never done this
Baby, be gentle
It’s my first time
I’ve got you inside
People are boring
But you’re something else completely
Damn, let’s take our chances

I wanna take you in the kitchen
Lift up your wedding dress someone was probably murdered in
So bourgeoisie to keep waiting
Dating for twenty years just feels pretty civilian

And I’ve never thought that
Ever thought that once in my whole life
You are my first time
People are boring
But you’re something else I can’t explain
Here take my last name
First time, you let me stay the night despite your own rules
You took off early to go cheat your way through film school
You left a note in your perfect script:
"Stay as long as you want," and I haven’t left your bed since

I haven’t hated
All the same things as somebody else
Since I remember
What’s going on for, uh, what are you doing with your whole life?
How about forever?17Embed
