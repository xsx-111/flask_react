Strange Melody LyricsRun around, run around, run around
Run around, run around, run around
Say you ran from the shadows you cast
And the hand of the woman you knew
Circled 'round for the sirens you found
But your hard luck look isn't true
And they say
I hear you're runnin' on empty now
But you can't see me, the better half of a strange melody
For the run around, run around, run around to me
Run around, run around do do do
Run around, run around do do do
Say you ran from the shadows you cast
And the hand of the woman you knew
Circled 'round for the sirens you found
But your hard luck look isn't true
And they say
I hear you're runnin' on empty now
But you can't see me, the better half of a strange melody
For the run around, run around, run around to me
Run around, run around
Run around, run aroundEmbed
