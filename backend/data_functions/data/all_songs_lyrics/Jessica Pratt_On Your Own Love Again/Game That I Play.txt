Game That I Play Lyrics
People's faces blend together
Like a watercolor you can't remember in time

Were you coming to me to tell me you're mine? (Why do I?)
You got a look 'bout you, baby, too hard to find

I don't wanna be changing the game that I play (What I play)
But I see that you're leaving, so what can I say? (What can I say?)
It's the game that I play

Though I say I often try to leave my thoughts of you behind

Were you coming to me to tell me you're mine? (Why do I?)
Take a look 'round you, baby, think that you'll find

I don't wanna be changing the game that I play (What I play)
But I see that you're leaving, so what can I say? (What can I say?)
It's the game that I play

I'd like to go there sometime
Just to know what you're thinking
I guess the choice now is mine
Hard to know where we've been
And this motion is quickenin'
And this motion is sickenin'2Embed
