Back, Baby Lyrics
Sometimes I pray for the rain

You know I try, to see things from your side
To leave things undefined
But where would you advise?
That I generate a new design
For the missing piece I had to disguise
Saw a paper with the header that your love is just a myth I devised
And things like that you can never take back again
Things like that you can never take back again

If there was a time
That you loved me
If there was a time
When you said that you want me to believe

But you can't go back, baby
Can't go back, baby
And sometimes I pray for the rain

You and your glass world that does ring
Though at times a frozen thing
It encloses you in its crystalline
Look so lovely but you’ll have to decide
If you could play it in reverse then you’d find
That you’d better reconsider all the love you took and then cast aside
But things like that you can never take back again
Things like that you can never take back again
If there was a time
When you loved me
If there was a time
When you said that you want me to believe

But you can't go back, baby
Can't go back, baby
And sometimes I pray for the rain

Girl I know I'm losing time without you
Never had a second chance before this time
But things like that, they never do work out right
Things like that, no, they never do work out right

Can't go baby baby
Can't go back baby
And sometimes I pray for the rain
And sometimes I pray for the rain3Embed
