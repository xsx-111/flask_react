Greycedes Lyrics
Turn the pages of a book cause I can't even look
At the words there, tell me what they say
I can't even try, to read the words sometimes

You go by two by two just stepping to the door
Release me now, my lonely boy
The soldier's home from war
Everybody tells me
He's the kinda guy, you don't know why he does
Ooo, stargazer, gaze for awhile
Let me love you, baby
