On Your Own Love Again LyricsHere are the lies you've been telling me
There is a line of girls empty-handed
Everybody knows you're just a little tease
I tried to believe in you somehow
But every time I do, I get down and out
Cause there are the lies you've been telling me
Here is a way that you have understood it
Everybody knows you're just life in a dream
I guess I'll try to keep on believing
You're just someone out there in chains
You're just here on your own love againEmbed
