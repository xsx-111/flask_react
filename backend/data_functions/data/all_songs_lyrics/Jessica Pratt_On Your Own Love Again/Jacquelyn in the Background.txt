Jacquelyn in the Background LyricsLinger through the night
I look so long, I can't find
Another friend like you; you and I
If you just can't find the words to tell
Let me say that I know you well
Deep inside your lonely room
I try to tell you but never get too far
Oh, dear Jacquelyn, I see you coming through
See the changes in your smile
In the background, you're changing colors now
Leave your bad news for a while
Drifting through the day
I look so long, I can't say I've
Found another friend like you; you and I
If you just can't find the words to tell
Let me say that I know you well
Deep inside my lonely room
I cry the tears of never knowing you
Oh, dear Jacquelyn, I see you coming through
See the changes in your smile
In the background, you come in colors now
Leave your bad news for a while
If you just can't find the words to say
I never thought of it that way
But I can't see nobody, I can't tell
I can't see nobody1Embed
