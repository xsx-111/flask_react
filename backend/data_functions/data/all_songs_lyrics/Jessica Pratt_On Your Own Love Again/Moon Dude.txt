Moon Dude Lyrics
Moon dude, you can try the weight
Of your body now in outer space
In time, you can cast a gaze on our planet lines, ta-da
You're on the outside, you're looking in
To the escalators humming
They are pulling you from nothing
But your loneliness

I know you're searching all the time
In the corners of your mind
But you can't turn this planet round
But, boy, don't you want me now?


I know you're searching all the time
Through the corners of your mind
But you can't turn this planet 'round
Oh don't let me down
Boy, don't you want me now?

My true geranium blue
They are looking for you there
With rotations in the air
They can't see you
Lest you be shining
Lest you be shining downEmbed
