Wrong Hand Lyrics
Saw you running 'round the world
With your head above the ground
And you're dancing too close behind
With the darling in a hidden shroud
And you don't know how you got here before
You were dancing with the wrong hand

One too many dreams I had before
And they play in my mind
See you standing where you stood alone
In my mind, in my mind

Saw you running 'round the world
With your head above the ground
And you're dancing too close behind
With the darling in a hidden shroud
And you don't know how you got here before
You were dancing with the wrong hand

One too many dreams I had before
And they play in my mind
See you standing where you stood alone
In my mind, in my mindEmbed
