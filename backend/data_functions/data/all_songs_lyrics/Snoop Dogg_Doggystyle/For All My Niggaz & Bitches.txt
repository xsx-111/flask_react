For All My Niggaz & Bitches Lyrics
Well it's that slow flow, D-O-double-G, nigga
See these other fools but you can't see me, nigga
Who am I? (It's Kurupt, motherfucker)
Do or die (We gives a fuck, motherfucker)
So slow your roll, I'm In Control like Janet
The loc-est twenty-one year old nigga that's on this planet
Take it for granted, if ya wanna, 'cause I'm gonna
Grab my strap then clear the corner, biatch!!

To all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin hands in the air

Now on a one (one) two (two) three (three) who could it be?
Comin with a grip of gangsta shit for ninety-three
So ninety-four's arrived nigga, back on up
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there
Wherever I bails, I put it down all around
'Cause ain't shit for sale in the Coupe
With the beat flossin off gold D's
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for gettin us all fucked up
Now check it, it's a callin for niggas like Doggs
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin like hoes
(Yes y'all) other Doggs (yes y'all) Yiggy y'all
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball
I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this
Now how many bitches must get dicked?
Before they say, "Oh is it that nigga from back in the day?
Ya never ever thought I'd see him bustin with Dr. Dre"
"Cause I grips mics, I rips mics in half
Hoes be comin to my flat so I can tap that ass

To all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin hands in the air
You're headed my way, nigga you best to hit a U-turn quick
So what's happenin? I'm cappin shit up like a Western flick
The kingpin of the clique, top notch
17 shot Glock cocked, so all nigga drop
The run of the mill fool get broke off for tryin to serve
The best Kurupt's era, peep the terror, 'cause it's a murder fest
I smoke chronic every day, so what have we?
Another motherfucker, gettin served like some cavy
Now who, drops (ruff rhymes) I got the juice like 2Pac
(Plus I'm) rollin with two Glocks
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt
Hellraisin like Pinhead, beware I'm tearin shit the fuck up
Slow your roll, like your legs was broken
Who's jokin? Rakim never joked, so why should I loc?
Now that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow doe
Runnin em like Flo Jo, stranded on Death Row
Mediocre motherfuckers die 'cause I'm servin and
They can't fuck with or see me, I'm mass-murderous
(Smokin indo, look out my window I suppose) Yeah
(Niggas don't understand how we kicks diffrent flows
I'm raw like news footage) I'm rugged like a BF Goodrich
(Bring your whole set and get your hood lynched)
(Drop to your knees like a dog in heat)
Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techniques
To all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your motherfuckin fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin fingers in the air

Check it out, it's Rage, ready for the breakdown
Take down, when it comes to the mic I'm puttin my weight down
And that's 175 pounds of beef
Beatin' yo' ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm stranded on Death Row with no where to go, so
What's a girl to do?
Take out a crew, or two, a few, what you wanna do?

Throw your guns in the motherfuckin air, we don't care
(Niggas don't give a fuck nigga)
About nuthin at all, just my Doggs and clockin the grip bitch
(Niggas don't give a fuck nigga)
That's why I can kick it so tuff, cuz when times get ruff, my
(Niggas don't give a fuck nigga)
The clique I'm with, don't give a sheeit, ya know why?
(Real niggas don't give a fuck)
Now all the bitches, and the niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
To all my niggas, and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
To all my niggas, and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin fingers in the air9Embed
