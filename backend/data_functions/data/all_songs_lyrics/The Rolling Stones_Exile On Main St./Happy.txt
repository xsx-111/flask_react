Happy Lyrics
Well, I never kept a dollar past sunset
It always burned a hole in my pants
Never made a school mama happy
Never blew a second chance, oh no

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy

Always took candy from strangers
Didn't wanna get me no trade
Never want to be like papa
Working for the boss every night and day

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love
Baby, won't you keep me happy?
Baby, won't you keep me happy? (Happy)
Baby, please keep me

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby
Never got a flash out of cocktails
When I got some flesh off the bone
Never got a lift out of Lear jets
When I can fly way back home

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby

Happy
Baby, won't you keep me happy
Baby, won't you keep me happy
Baby, won't you keep me happy
Baby, won't you keep me happy
Baby, won't you keep me happy
Oh, keep, oh, baby, keep me happy
Now, baby, won't you keep me happy
Baby, got me feeling happy
Now, now, now, now, now, happy
Come on now, keep me happy
Keep on, baby, keep me happyEmbed
