Casino Boogie Lyrics
No good, can't speak, wound up, no sleep
Sky diver inside her, slip rope, stunt flyer
Wounded lover, got no time on hand

One last cycle, thrill freak Uncle Sam
Pause for business, hope you'll understand
Judge and jury walk out hand in hand

Dietrich movies, close up boogies, kissing cunt in Cannes
Grotesque music, million dollar sad
Got no tactics, got no time on hand


Left shoe shuffle, right shoe muffle, sinking in the sand
Fade out freedom, steaming heat on, watch that hat in black
Finger twitching, got no time on handEmbed
