Lavender Blue LyricsI was walking in the park
Dreaming of a spark
When I heard the sprinklers whisper, shimmer
In the haze of summer lawns
Then I heard the children singing
They were running through the rainbows
They were singing a song for you
Well, it seemed to be a song for you
The one I wanted to write for you, for you, you
Lavenders blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green
When I am King, dilly dilly, you will be Queen
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I.O.U. for your love, I.O.U. for your love
Lavenders green, dilly dilly, lavenders blue
When you love me, dilly dilly, I will love you
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I.O.U. for your love, I.O.U. for your love
Lavenders green, dilly dilly, lavenders blue
When you love me, dilly dilly, I will love you
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I.O.U. for your love, I.O.U. for your loveEmbed
