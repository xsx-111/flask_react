White Feather LyricsWhen I hit the streets back in '81
Found a heart in the gutter and a poet's crown
I felt barbed wire kisses and icicle tears
Where have I been for all these years?
I saw political intrigue, political lies
Gonna wipe those smiles of self-satisfaction from their eyes
I will wear your white feather I will carry your white flag
I will swear I have no nation but I'm proud to own my heart
I will wear your white feather I will carry your white flag
I will swear I have no nation but I'm proud to own my heart
My heart, this is my heart
We don't need no uniforms, we have no disguise
Divided we stand, together we'll rise
We will wear your white feather
All the children
We will carry your white flag
We will swear we have no nations
Beirut children
But we're proud to own our hearts
Jerusalem children
We will wear your white feather
Tokyo children
We will carry your white flag
Moscow children
We will swear we have no nations
Washington children
But we're proud to own our hearts
Munich children
These are our hearts
Chicago children
These are our hearts
Cairo children
You can't take away our hearts...
You can't steal our hearts away
I can't walk away I can't walk away
No more, no more, no more, no more...1Embed
