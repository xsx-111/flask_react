Blue Angel (Demo) LyricsThe sky was Bible black in Lyon
When I met the Magdalene
She was paralyzed in a streetlight
She refused to give her name
And a ring of violet bruises
They were pinned upon her arm
Two hundred francs for sanctuary
And she led me by the hand
To that room of dancing shadows
Where all the heartache disappears
And in the glowing tongues of candles
I heard her whisper in my ear
"J'entend ton coeur', j'entend ton coeur"
I can hear your heart, I can hear your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart
Your heart, your heartEmbed
