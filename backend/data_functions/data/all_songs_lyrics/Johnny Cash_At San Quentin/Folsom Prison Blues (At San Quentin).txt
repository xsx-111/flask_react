Folsom Prison Blues (At San Quentin) Lyrics"We want to thank the officials of San Quentin Prison, all of the guards for helping us out. The warden, every one of them. Appreciate it."
(Boos)
"Aww, you don't really mean that now!"
(laughter, applause)
"Yeah, water, yeah. Can I have a drink of water? Is the water bad here? Hey, you know something? They're doing a discography, whatever that is, on Johnny Cash records. You wanna hear a good line? They serve everything in tin cups around here. That's the second song from now. Third song from now. Hey, you think I didn't get water in a tin cup? Listen! Hello, I'm Johnny Cash!"
"I want to tell you about the three fellas that make the great sound behind me. Two of them have been with me for about thirteen years. There's Marshall Grant. From Jackson, Tennessee, W.S. Holland. And just recently joining our group, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, Bob Woolton."
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues awayEmbed
