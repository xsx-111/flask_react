I Walk the Line (At San Quentin) Lyrics"You know, we've been on tour for about a week now, after our last recording session, and they say old Johnny Cash works good under pressure. Put the screws on me and I'm gonna screw right out from under you, is what I'm gonna do though. Tired of all that shit. By God, that's right. All right! I tell you what, the show is being recorded and televised for England, and uh, they said, they told me, they said 'you gotta do this song, you gotta do that song, you gotta stand like this and act like this.' I just don't get it, man, you know? I'm here to do what you want me to and what I want to do, right? So what do you want to hear? All right, all right. I Walk the Line!"
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the lineEmbed
