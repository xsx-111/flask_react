Wreck of the Old 97 (At San Quentin) LyricsWell, they gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia
Said Steve, you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
Put her into Spencer on time
Then he turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
"Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak Mountain
Watch old 97 roll"
Then a telegram come from Washington station
This is how it read
"Oh, that brave engineer that has run old 97
Is lying in old Danville, dead"
He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
So now all you pretty ladies you better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Never speak hard words to your true loving husband
He may leave you and never return, poor boy
"I want to thank you. Itâ€™s good to see you."Embed
