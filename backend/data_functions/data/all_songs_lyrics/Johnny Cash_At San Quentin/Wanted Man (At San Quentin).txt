Wanted Man (At San Quentin) Lyrics"Last week in Nashville, Bob Dylan, one of the top writers... Well, I don't have to tell you who Bob Dylan is, the greatest writer of our time was at our house. And he and I sat down and wrote a song together, let me see if I can find... yeah, here it is. It's called "Wanted Man." Do you know the introduction, Bob?"
Wanted man in California, wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City, wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi, wanted man in old Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man
I might be in Colorado or Georgia by the sea
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
If you ever see me coming and if you know who I am
Don't you breathe it to nobody 'cause you know I'm on the lam
Wanted man by Lucy Watson, wanted man by Jeannie Brown
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson, wanted man in this next town
Well, I've had all that I wanted of a lot of things I had
And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad
I got sidetracked in El Paso, stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way into Juarez with Juanita on my lap
Then I went to sleep in Shreveport, woke up in Abilene
Wondering why the hell I'm wanted at some town halfway between
Wanted man in Albuquerque, wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee, wanted man in Baton Rouge
There's somebody set to grab me anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight, you might get a glimpse of me
Wanted man in California, wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City, wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi, wanted man in old Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted manEmbed
