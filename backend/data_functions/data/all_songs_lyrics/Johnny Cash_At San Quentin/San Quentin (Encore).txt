San Quentin (Encore) Lyrics"Here it is again, "San Quentin" just for you!"

San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've guarded me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped asking why

San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and you've scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman, you can't understand

San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold

San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
San Quentin, you've been living hell to me
(applause)
"Thank you. All right, we'll do it again after a while. Before we go tonight, we'll do it again. I kind of like it myself now."Embed
