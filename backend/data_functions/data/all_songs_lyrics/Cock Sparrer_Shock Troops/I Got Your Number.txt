I Got Your Number LyricsIt can't be right what I'm reading here
No one believes in all this stuff no more
Our ideas don't see eye to eye
Get your press with a pocketfull of lies
Telling everybody every word is true
One day soon they're gonna see through you(Oh listen now)
(Chorus)
I got your number, you can fool some people some part of the time
I got your number, I ain't ever gonna toe that particular partyline
There'll be some people gonna back you up
But don't look here for moral support
Don't you ask no favours from me
I don't believe in charity
Telling everybody you're wonderful
What are you gonna do when there's no one left to tell it to(So listen now)
(Chorus)
I got your number, you can fool some people some part of the time
I got your number, I ain't ever gonna toe that particular partyline
You think you're so special, but you're only fooling
Tell your lies to anyone but me
(Solo)
You think you're so special, but you're only fooling
Tell your lies to anyone but me ('Cause I can see through you)
(Chorus)
I got your number, you can fool some people some part of the time
I got your number, I ain't ever gonna toe that particular partyline
(Oh listen now)
I got your number, you can fool some people some part of the time
I got your number, I ain't ever gonna toe that particular partyline
(Listen to me)
I got your number, you can fool some people some part of the time
I got your number, I ain't ever gonna toe that particular partylineEmbed
