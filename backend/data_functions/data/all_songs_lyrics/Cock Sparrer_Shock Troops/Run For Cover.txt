Run For Cover LyricsCock Sparrer
Run For Cover (Pretty Close To Correct)
Can't eat, don't sleep no more
Whatever you said, It's all been said before
Spent too much time drinking whiskey and beer
Times coming for a change around here
Chorus
I'm the kid with the Iq
And I'm coming to get you
Ain't nothing for you to do
Except to run for cover
I've got you sussed now
What you gunna do?
(Some Verse Goes Here)
Just walk up from me to you
No more hiding now, I'm on the loose
I'm telling you baby, there is really no use
Chorus
I'm the kid with the Iq
And I'm coming to get you
Ain't nothing for you to do
Except to run for cover
(Solo)
You can't eat, don't sleep no more
Whatever you said, It's all been said before
Spent too much time drinking whiskey and beer
Times coming for a change around here
All around here
Chorus:
I'm the kid with the Iq
And I'm coming to get you
Ain't nothing for you to do
Except to run for cover
Your gunna run for cover
Your gunna run... for cover, Oooh, Oooh, PleaseEmbed
