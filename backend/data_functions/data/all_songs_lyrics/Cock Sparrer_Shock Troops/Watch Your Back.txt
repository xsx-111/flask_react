Watch Your Back LyricsEverybody's talking bout' revolution
Everybody's talking bout' smash the state
Sounds to me like a bum solution
Right wing, left wing full of hate
(Chorus)
We don't wanna fight
'Cause you tell us to
So watch your back when you attack
'Cause we might just turn on you
Things get worse with every hour
The future fades into the past
All they want is total power
Climbing on the backs of the working class
(Chorus)
We don't wanna fight
'Cause you tell us to
So watch your back when you attack
'Cause we might just turn on you
We don't wanna fight
'Cause you tell us to
So watch your back when you attack
'Cause we might just turn on you
We don't wanna be part of no new religion
We don't wanna be part of a political dream
We just wanna get on living our lives
(Chorus)
We don't wanna fight
'Cause you tell us to
So watch your back when you attack
'Cause we might just turn on you
We don't wanna fight
'Cause you tell us to
So watch your back when you attack
'Cause we might just turn on youEmbed
