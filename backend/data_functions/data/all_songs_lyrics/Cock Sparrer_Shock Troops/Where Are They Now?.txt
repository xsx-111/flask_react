Where Are They Now? LyricsI believed in Julie when she said how easy it could be
And I believed in Tommy and his written words of anarchy
And I believed in Joe when he said we had to fight
And I believed in Jimmywhen he told us to unite
(Chorus)
Where are they now
Where are they now
Where are they, six years on and they've all gone
Now it's all turned sour
Where are they now
Hollywood nights in Soho
Writing on the wall of The Roxy loo
Rotten on the telly
Showing what a few choice words can do
Was it ever worth it
Causing all the fuss
You know, I believed in them
Don't you believe in us
(Chorus)
No more kids are innocent
We will get fooled again
Only faces ever change
The song remains the same
Was it ever worth it
Causing all the fuss
You know, I believed in them
Don't you believe in us
(Chorus)
Where are they know....Embed
