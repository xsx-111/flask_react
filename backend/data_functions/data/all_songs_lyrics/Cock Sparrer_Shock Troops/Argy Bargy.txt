Argy Bargy LyricsIt started off like any other show
Sunday nights on the radio
Terry played the songs we wanted to hear
And terry said things no one else would dare
He gave it all that he had to give
They said it was his only reason to live
But we just listened to the ruck n roll
Terry the dj's radio show
He give it some of that argy bargy
Giving it all the chat
He give it some argy bargy
Now what do you think of that
Then came the evening of the mile end row
The ol' bill found out i don't know how
We know they tried to lock us up that night
We were ready for a fight
Terry came onto the air at ten
He said the filth were waiting for us then
Down at the black boy they were there in force
And he war right of course
They told him that he'd better change the song
They said to tell us that the kids were wrong
They gave him one more sunday night, to get it right
That was the night when the girls all cried
That was the night that he said goodbye
'cos no matter who paid him, terry never told us a lieEmbed
