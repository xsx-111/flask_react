Teenage Heart LyricsFriend of my mine said he rather be dead, with a bullet from a 45 in his head
Or his wrist slashed to ribbons with a blade instead, than reach 24 that's what he said
Ooh, ooh, ooh, what they trying to do to my teenage heart
I said Ooh, ooh, ooh, what they trying to do, try to tear it apart, try to tear it apart, My Teenage Heart
Remember the first time it seems so long, had a new guitar and a handful of songs
We played in a run-down railroad shack, they said you're too loud, get out and don't you come back
Ooh, ooh, ooh, what they trying to do with my teenage heart... my teenage heart...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, what they trying to do, try to tear it apart, try to tear it apart
My Teenage Heart
High class pros in soho bars, two time tramps wanna sleep with the stars
Living fast since the day they were born
Made it big, and now you gotta conform
Ooh, ooh, ooh, what they trying to do with my teenage heart...my teenage heart...
I said Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, what they trying to do, try to tear it apart, try to tear it apart
