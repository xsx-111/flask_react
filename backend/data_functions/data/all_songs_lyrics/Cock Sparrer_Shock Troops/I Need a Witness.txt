I Need a Witness LyricsI got home this morning 'bout a quarter to four
I found my baby headin' out the door
Cuz i been out dancin all night long
She thought i been romancin' but she got it wrong
I try to stay clean she won't let me be
Shes always checkin up on me
I need a witness
Yeah i wasn't sure but i thought she saw
I need a witness
I dont wanna show it i hope i dont blow it
I love that lady but shes such a wench
Ended sleeping on that old pine bench
Cuz i been out dancin all night long
She thought i been romancin' but she got it wrong
I try to stay clean she won't let me be
Shes always checkin up on me
I need a witness
Yeah i wasn't sure but i thought she saw
I need a witness
I dont wanna show it i hope i dont blow it
I need a witness
I need a witness
I need a witness
I need a witness
I need a witness
Yeah i wasn't sure but i thought she saw
I need a witness
I dont wanna show it i hope i dont blow it
