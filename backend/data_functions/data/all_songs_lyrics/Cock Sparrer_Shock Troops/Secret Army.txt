Secret Army LyricsCollecting funds for the holy fight
Like a door to door salesman in the dead of night
Russian guns help him on his way
Bought with money from the USA
And the ordinary people say
(What's it for?)
And the ordinary people say
(We want no more!)
But the man at the top knows where to do the most harm
He's in he secret army
And this man with a gun says not a sound
I want this aeroplane turned around
He spent his life learning how to fill a man with lead
He'll probably spend the rest of it dead
And the ordinary people say
(What's it for?)
And the ordinary people say
(We want no more!)
But the man at the top knows where to do the most harm
He's in he secret army
When a bomb goes off in a city street
When a man gets killed for his beliefs
When a mother cries for the son she had
That's when the world's gone mad
And the ordinary people say
(What's it for?)
And the ordinary people say
(We want no more!)
But the man at the top knows where to do the most harm
He's in he secret army
And the ordinary people say
(What's it for?)
And the ordinary people say
(We want no more!)
But the man at the top knows where to do the most harm
He's in he secret army
He's in he secret army
He's in he secret...Embed
