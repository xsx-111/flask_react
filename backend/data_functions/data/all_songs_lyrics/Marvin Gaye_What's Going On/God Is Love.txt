God Is Love Lyrics
Don't go and talk about my father
God is my friend, (Jesus is my friend) he is my friend
He made this world for us to live in (He made this world)
And gave us everything (Lord gave us everything)
And all he asks of us (Peace!)
Is we give each other love, oh yeah

Don't go and talk about my father
Because God is my friend, (Jesus is my friend) he is my friend
He loves us whether or not we know it (Just loves us, oh yeah)
And He'll forgive all our sins, (He'll forgive our sins) forgive all our sins
And all He asks of us, oh yeah, is we give each other love, oh yeah

Love your mother, she bore you
Love your father, he works for you
Love your sister, she's good to you
Love your brother, love your brother

Don't go and talk about my father, He's good to us
God is my friend, (Jesus is my friend) he is my friend
And when we call on Him for mercy, mercy Father
He'll be merciful, my friend, oh, yes He will
All he asks of us, I know-4Embed
