Wholy Holy Lyrics
Wholy holy
Come together
Wholy holy
People, we all got to come together
Because we need the strength, power and all the feeling

Wholy holy
Oh Lord, get together, one another
Wholy holy
We should believe in one another
Jesus left a long time ago, said he would return
He left us a book to believe in, in it we've got a lot to learn
Oh yeah

Wholy
Oh Lord, we can conquer hate forever, we need him
Wholy
We can rock the world's foundation
Everybody together, together and holy
Will holler love, love, love across the nation

Oh, oh
Wholy holy
All together and holy
We proclaim love, our salvation
Oh, oh, ooo1Embed
