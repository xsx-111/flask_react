Table Tennis LyricsThe force of your gravity
It defines my tendency
Velocity's equal to
Throwing myself with you
We have potential energy
Motion between you and me
I'll be your sounding board
Just throw yourself toward
This energy that sings between
Bounce off of me
Elasticity

Connection
Collision
Rebounding, rebounding
Motion and energy
Rebounding, rebounding
...and energy, motion and energy
Rebounding
Transfer into me, transferring
Enter me
Transfer into me
Transfer energy
Enter me1Embed
