Then You Hold Me LyricsSomething inside of myself is torn
And I can hardly stand
I can feel those precious years
Slipping through my hands
Lights have failed, I'm in the dark
Imprisoned inside of myself
But then you hold me
And I wouldn't be anybody else
I'm thinking of the ships of my sailing days
Not long gone I know, but they feel lifetimes away
Wires are cut, I'm disconnected
Feeding back inside of myself
But then you hold me
Oh and I wouldn't be anybody else
You made me thrill, you made me whole
And I thank you for your presence full of soul
Now when I come home with my face all worn
My voice in shreds and my pride in rags
When I'm sick of my work and I look like dirt
And I feel like shutting down blinds and packing up bags
When there's no pill will console me
And no drug will free me from myself
That's when you hold me
And I wouldn't be anybody elseEmbed
