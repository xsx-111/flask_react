Trumpets LyricsYour love feels
Like trumpets sound
I said your love feels
Like trumpets sound
Your life is like a mountain
Yes, your life is like a mountain
And your heart is like a church
With wide open doors
And to be with you
Is to find myself in the best of dreams
Your love feels like trumpets
Your love feels
Like high summer
Your love feels
Like high, high, summer
Your life is like an ocean
Yes, your life is like an ocean
I want to dive in naked
Lose myself in your depths
I want to be with you
To find myself in the best of dreams
Your love feels like trumpets
Please don't wake me
No don't shake me
I want to be with you
When being with you is the same
The same as being you
Your love feels like trumpetsEmbed
