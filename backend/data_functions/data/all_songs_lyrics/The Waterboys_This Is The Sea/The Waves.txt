The Waves LyricsWhen I walk barefoot on the soil in the morning
I can feel the heartbeat of the holy earth
Under my feet
And when I climb high among the hills, schooled in wonder
I can feel the hurtling and the moving of the soul of the world
As it speaks to me
And when I fall into illusion's arms, even unto darkness
Still I feel the power of the unquenchable light
As it holds me
And when I die, I'm going back over, I'm going back over
In the boxcar of my soul to the high far summer lands
Where I began
Where I beganEmbed
