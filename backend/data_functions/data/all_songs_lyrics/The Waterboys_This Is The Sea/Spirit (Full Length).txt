Spirit (Full Length) LyricsMan gets tired, spirit don't
Man surrenders, spirit won't
Man crawls, spirit flies
Spirit lives when man dies
Man seems, spirit is
Man dreams, spirit lives
Man is tethered, spirit is free
What spirit is man can be
Now we tread the fresh fields
The higher grounds and the summer slopes
That man may someday climb on
Now we tread the fresh fields
The higher ground and the summer slopes
That man may someday climb on
We're on the heels of Rimbaud
We are in the swing
Chandelier-like dancing
And we feel everything
High on the wine of life
High on the wine of life
Untethered and free
Untethered and free
What spirit is man can beEmbed
