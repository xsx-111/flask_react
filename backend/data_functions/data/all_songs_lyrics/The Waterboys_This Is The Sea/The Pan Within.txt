The Pan Within Lyrics
Come with me
On a journey beneath the skin
Come with me
On a journey under the skin
We will look together
For the Pan within
Close your eyes
Breathe slow we'll begin
Close your eyes
Breathe slow and we will begin
To look together
For the Pan within


Swing your hips
Loose your head, and let it spin
Swing your hips
Loose you head, and let it spin
And we will look together
For the Pan within
Close your eyes
Breathe slow and we will begin
Close your eyes
Breathe slow and we will begin
To look together
For the Pan within

Put your face in my window
Breathe a night full of treasures
The wind is delicious
Sweet and wild with the promise of pleasure
The stars are alive and nights like these
Were born to be sanctified by you and me
Lovers, thieves, fools and pretenders
And all we gotta and all we gotta
And all we gotta and all we gotta
And all we gotta
And all we gotta do is surrender
And all we gotta do is surrender
Surrender
Come with me
On a journey under the skin
Come with me
On a journey under the skin
And we will look together for the Pan within

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
We'll begin
We'll begin
We'll begin
We'll begin
We'll beginEmbed
