This Is the Sea (Live) LyricsThese things you keep
You better throw them away
Turn your back
On your soulless days
Once you were tethered
Now you are free
Once you were tethered
Now you are free
That was the river
This is the sea
If you're feeling weary
Maybe been alone too long
Or else you've been suffering from
A few too many plans that have gone wrong
And you're trying to remember
How fine your life used to be
Running around banging your drum
Like it's nineteen-seventy-three
Well that was the river
This is the sea
You say you've got trouble
You say you've got pain
You say you've got nothin' to hold on to
Nothing to trust, nothing but chains
You've been scouring your conscience
And raking through your memory
Scouring your conscience
And raking through your memory
But that was the river
This is the sea
I can see you wavering
As you try to decide
You've got a war in your head
And it's tearing you up inside
You're trying to make sense
Of something that you just don't see
You're trying to make sense now
And you know you once held the key
But that was the river
This is the sea
Now I hear there's a train
It's coming down the line
It's yours if you hurry
You've got still enough time
And you don't need no ticket
And you don't pay no fee
You don't need a ticket
You don't pay a fee
That was the river
This is the sea1Embed
