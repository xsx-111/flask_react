The Ocean Lyrics
When you wake, what is it that you think of most?
When your bed is empty, do you really sleep alone?
If I imagine you, body next to another
All around me, new love and it makes me sad
All around me, feel assured that you'll be back
If I imagine you, body next to another

Stop crying to the ocean, stop crying over me
Stop worrying over nothing, stop worrying over me

So, it's been so long since you said
"Well, I know what I want and what I want's right here with you."

On the drive back here, I was worrying over nothing
On the drive back there, tears spilling over something
When I imagine you, body next to another
In the door and you're there and you're sorry for the fright
In the door, can I hear you saying you don't want to fight?
When I imagine you, body next to another

Stop crying to the ocean, stop crying over me
Stop worrying over nothing, stop worrying over me
So, it's been so long since you said
"Well, I know what I want and what I want's right here with you."
It's been so long since you said
"Well, I know what I want and what I want's right here with you."

In a flash, back to you, just brought attention to the mess
In a flash, you're on top, begging me to understand
If I imagine you, body next to another
You drop in for a minute and I'm sorry that I didn't drop in sooner
Just to see you and see what you've been doing
If I imagine you, body next to another

So, it's been so long since you said
"Well, I know what I want and what I want's right here with you."
It's been so long since you said
"Well, I know what I want and what I want's right here with you."
It's been so long since you said
"Well, I know what I want and what I want's right here with you."
It's been so long since you said
"Well, I know what I want and what I want's right here with you."Embed
