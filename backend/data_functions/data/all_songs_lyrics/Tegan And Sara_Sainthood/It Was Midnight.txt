It Was Midnight Lyrics
It was midnight
Your hand was in mine
All eyes were on our table
It was after noon before you were out of bed and I was able to concentrate
To figure out a plan to keep you here
To evaluate
To make a list, a list to convince you

Don't run away
It only fuels the flames
Don't pull away
It only makes me want to stay

It was monday
You were packing on my floor
My eyes were charting every move you made
It was early evening before you were home and I was sure you were safe
I can't concentrate
I try so hard to plan to keep you here
I can't evaluate
I threw away the list to convince you
x2
Gone..gone..gone..gone

Don't run away
It only fuels the flames
Don't pull away
It only makes me want to stay
(it was midnight)
Don't run away
It only fuels the flames
(it was midnight)
Don't pull away
It only makes me want to stayEmbed
