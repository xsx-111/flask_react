The Cure Lyrics
Begging like you might take order in your own hands
I stare, seems like I don't care
Drop a chance in your hands, then
I know that bad's got to fix itself, correct over time
And I know 'cause I've got the cure
I've got a cure for your crimes

All I dreamed up, all that seemed like luck seems silly to you now
All I said to you, all I did for you seems so silly to me now
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Screaming like no one might call the cops and arrest you this time
Standing back against my building's back door, you're hoping for a ride
I know the world's been mean to you, I've got a cure, hold tight
I know the world's not fair to you, I've got a cure for its crimes

All I dreamed up, all that seemed like luck seems silly to you now
All I said to you, all I did for you seems so silly to me now

Oh, oh, when you say it
So, so slowly to me
Oh, oh well, I keep going
Oh no, I ran while knowing
No, no, I know you need it
So, so I need it too
And oh, oh, I must keep going
So, so you must too
And oh, oh, when you say it
So, so slowly to me
Oh, oh well, I keep going
Oh no, I ran while knowing
No, no, I know you need it
So, so I need it too
And oh, oh, I must keep going
So, so you must too
Oh, oh, I've got a cure
I've got the cure for you
I've got a cure, I've got the cure
All I dreamed up, all that seemed like luck seems silly to you now
All I said to you, all I did for you seems so silly to me now
All I dreamed up, all that seemed like luck seems silly to you now
All I said to you, all I did for you seems so silly to me now

I've got a cure, I've got the cure for you
I've got a cure, I've got the cure for youEmbed
