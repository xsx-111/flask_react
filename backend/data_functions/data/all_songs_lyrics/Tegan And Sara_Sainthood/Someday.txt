Someday Lyrics
They yell, "Speak up!"
I fill these pages like I fill those spaces with my lies
They yell, "Step down!"
A crowd's not worth this and love's not worthless
You've got to step up, stranger

Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
Might write something I might want to say to you someday
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
Mark my words, I might be something someday

They yell, "Right on!"
A class act president, you are my boss
I am confident in your eyes
They yell, "Move up!"
Don't stand back here and wait like an animal at a farmer's gate
Am I food or am I free?
So speak up, this is your last chance, my friend
Roll the windows down and take me in
Reach out, say what you're really about
Are you coming here or not?
Are you coming out?
Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
Might write something I might want to say to you someday
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
Mark my words, I might be something someday
Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
Might write something I might want to say to you someday
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
Mark my words, I might be something someday

I don't want to know that you don't want me
I don't want to know what you'd do without me
I don't want to know what I'll be without you
I don't want to know, I don't want to know
I don't want to know that you don't want me
I don't want to know what you'd do without me
I don't want to know what I'll be without you
I don't want to know, I don't want to know

Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
Might write something I might want to say to you someday
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
Mark my words, I might be something someday
Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
Might write something I might want to say to you someday
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
Mark my words, I might be something someday
Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
(I don't want to know that you don't want me)
Might write something I might want to say to you someday
(I don't want to know what you'd do without me)
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
(I don't want to know what I'll be without you)
Mark my words, I might be something someday
(I don't want to know, I don't want to know)
Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
(I don't want to know that you don't want me)
Might write something I might want to say to you someday
(I don't want to know what you'd do without me)
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
(I don't want to know what I'll be without you)
Mark my words, I might be something someday
(I don't want to know, I don't want to know)1Embed
