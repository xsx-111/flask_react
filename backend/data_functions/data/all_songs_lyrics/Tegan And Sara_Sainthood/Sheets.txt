Sheets Lyrics
Remove us from the scene of the crime
I can't help myself, details fill my mind
They roll their eyes and pull our elbows
I forget our love was so hopeful

I promise I won't linger long
I promise I won't push my face up against your clothes
Or your stupid sheets

I deserve a stay, a second thought
I put your head on straight, tied my tourniquet
You want the marrying type, a commitment
Can't help myself, if it's a fit it'll fit

I promise I won't linger long
I promise I won't push my face up against your clothes
Or your stupid sheets

It's a heart attack that you feel
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's a heart attack that you feel
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's a heart attack that you feel
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's a heart attack that you feel
(That you feel, that you feel)
I promise I won't linger long
I promise I won't push my face up against your clothes
I won't linger long
I won't push my face up against your clothes
Or your stupid sheets
Just give me the key
I watch your things like I watch your face

It's a heart attack that you feel
It's a crying shame not to spend the night
You look your age but you don't act the type
You don't act the type

It's a heart attack that you feel
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's a heart attack that you feel
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's a heart attack that you feel
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's a heart attack that you feel
(That you feel, that you feel)Embed
