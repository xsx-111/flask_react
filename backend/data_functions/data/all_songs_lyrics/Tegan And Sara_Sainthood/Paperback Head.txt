Paperback Head Lyrics
You have to become what you fancy
Paperback head, you get carried away
Stitch up your spine to keep the suitors away

Must draw your own aid
Must sift your affairs
Must frame up a material girl

Wild fires, you must remit
Can't stand the smoke, pull the sheets down low
Rope up your mind, keep the suitors in line

Must draw your own aid
Must sift your affairs
Must frame up a material girl
A material girl

I gasp, like sugar and spice
I gasp, like sugar and spice
Who better than you?
Better than you?
Who better than you?
Better than you?
Who better than you?
Better than you?
Who better than you?
A paperback head, you get carried away
Stitch up your spine to keep the suitors away
Can't stand the smoke, pull the sheets down low
Rope up your mind, keep the suitors in line

Must draw your own aid
Must sift your affairs
Must frame up a material girl
A material girl
A material girl
A material girlEmbed
