Sentimental Tune Lyrics
You, in a simple gray coat, in a simple white room
Oh, now you know, you know it now
And so, now you know, you know it now
You hate the tenderhearted torch song
You catch a flame to my sentiment, my sentimental tune
Oh, now you know, you know it now
And so, now you know, you know it now

Hard-hearted, don't worry, I'm ready for a fight
Unnerved, the nerve, you're nervous, nervous that I'm right
Hard-hearted, don't worry, I'm ready for a fight
Unnerved, the nerve, you're nervous, nervous that I'm right

Now, with your cause and affection on my mind
I won't yield, throw caution into the blaze
Oh, now you know, you know it now
And so, now you know, you know it now
Watch, with a bit of friction, I'll be under your clothes
With a bit of focus, I'll be under your skin
Oh, now you know, you know it now
And so, now you know, you know it now

Hard-hearted, don't worry, I'm ready for a fight
Unnerved, the nerve, you're nervous, nervous that I'm right
Hard-hearted, don't worry, I'm ready for a fight
Unnerved, the nerve, you're nervous, you're nervous that I'm right
Oh, now you know, you know it now
And so, now you know, you know it now
Oh, now you know, you know it now
And so, now you know, you know it nowEmbed
