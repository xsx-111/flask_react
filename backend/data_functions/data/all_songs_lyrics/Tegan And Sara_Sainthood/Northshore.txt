Northshore Lyrics
Don't bend, don't bleed, don't beg, don't scream, don't whine, don't fight, don't tell me
Don't tell me, don't tell me
Don't feel, don't tear, don't kiss, don't care, don't touch, don't want me
Don't want me, don't want me

Something's so sick about this, my misery's so addictive
I'm halfway there, watching Northshore from the floor, singing to you over my shoulder

Don't run, don't hide, don't hurt, don't lie, don't breathe, don't try, don't find me
Don't find me, don't find me
Don't cringe, don't clench, don't look, don't flinch, don't know, don't go, don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me

Something's so sick about this, my misery's so addictive
I'm halfway there, watching Northshore from the floor, singing to you over my shoulder

Don't sing, don't talk, don't yell, don't laugh, don't think, don't speak, don't save me
Don't save me, don't save me
Don't stay, don't plan, don't heal, don't mend, don't take, don't send, don't love me
Don't love me, don't love me
Something's so sick about this, my misery's so addictive
I'm halfway there, watching Northshore from the floor, singing to you over my shoulder
Something's so sick about this, my misery's so addictive
I'm halfway there, watching Northshore from the floor, singing to you over my shoulder
Something's so sick about this, my misery's so addictive
(Sick about this, so addictive)
I'm halfway there, watching Northshore from the floor, singing to you over my shoulder
Something's so sick about this, my misery's so addictive
(Sick about this, so addictive)
I'm halfway there, watching Northshore from the floor, singing to you over my shoulder1Embed
