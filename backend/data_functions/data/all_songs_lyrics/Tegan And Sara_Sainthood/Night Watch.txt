Night Watch Lyrics
I've got grounds for divorce
It's in my blood, this divorce
I separate everybody
I need distance from your body
Oh, I deserve this anguish on my house

So get away, you cannot follow me
I get away, you cannot follow me
So get away, you cannot follow me
So get away, you cannot follow me
I get away

I've got grounds for recourse
Your lungs fill with discourse
You separate from my body
You need consistence from somebody
Oh, I deserve this anguish on my house

So get away, you cannot follow me
I get away, you cannot follow me
So get away, you cannot follow me
I get away, you cannot follow me
So get away, you cannot follow me
I get away, you cannot follow me
So get awayEmbed
