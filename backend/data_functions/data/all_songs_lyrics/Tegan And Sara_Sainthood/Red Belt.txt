Red Belt Lyrics
When you think nothing could be further from the truth
When you're sure nothing could be further from the cold, hard truth
I kneel to condition all the feelings that I feel

Slow it down, you have a tendency to rush back into your past
Slow it down, you transfer all your weight and disappear
You kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel

I've got a red belt around my mind
My hands tied up around these words
I wish you'd call but I know that you're out tonight
My ears fill with the sound of you kneeling
My ears fill with the sound of dissent
My ears fill with the sound of you arching

Slow it down, you have a tendency to rush back into your past
Slow it down, you transfer all your weight and disappear
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feelEmbed
