Arrow Lyrics
Would you take a straight and narrow, critical look at me?
Would you tell me tough love style, put judicial weight on me?

If you're thinking anything
If you're thinking endlessly
If you're thinking anything
If you're thinking

I feel the breeze, feel feathers of an arrow
Out in my yard, feathers of an arrow
I take my aim, do you feel me coming close?
I take my aim so you feel me coming close
I feel the breeze, feel feathers of an arrow
Out in my yard, feathers of an arrow
I take my aim, do you feel me coming close?
I take my aim so you feel me coming close

Would you take a calm and tender, terminal kind of care?
Would you touch me, cling and wage an intimate fight for me?

If you're thinking anything
If you're thinking endlessly
If you're thinking anything
If you're thinking
I feel the breeze, feel feathers of an arrow
Out in my yard, feathers of an arrow
I take my aim, do you feel me coming close?
I take my aim so you feel me coming close
I feel the breeze, feel feathers of an arrow
Out in my yard, feathers of an arrow
I take my aim, do you feel me coming close?
I take my aim so you feel me coming close
I feel the breeze, feel feathers of an arrow
Out in my yard, feathers of an arrow
I take my aim, do you feel me coming close?
I take my aim so you feel me coming close
(Would you take a)
I feel the breeze, feel feathers of an arrow
(Calm and tender)
Out in my yard, feathers of an arrow
(Terminal kind of care?)
I take my aim, do you feel me coming close?
(Calm and tender, terminal kind of)
I take my aim so you feel me coming closeEmbed
