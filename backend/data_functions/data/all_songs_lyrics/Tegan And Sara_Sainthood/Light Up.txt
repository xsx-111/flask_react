Light Up Lyrics
What would I do differently with two kids on my hip?
Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow
Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow

I'm the age you were then
What goes through your mind?
Find some success and reduce the worry on your babies' minds
Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow
Let them say what they will, beccause they will anyhow

Lay back and light up
Lay back and light up
Without any guilt
Lay back and light up
Lay back and light up
Without any guilt

Credit my weak heart and strong mind to that bad circumstance and that terrible time
Well I've searched for myself
What would I find?
Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow
Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow
Well eggshells are not easy to hold
We uncurl and unwind when we sleep side by side
Let them say what they will, beccause they will anyhow
Let them say what they will, beccause they will anyhow

Lay back and light up
Lay back and light up
Without any guilt
Lay back and light up
Lay back and light up
Without any guilt
Lay back and light up
Lay back and light upEmbed
