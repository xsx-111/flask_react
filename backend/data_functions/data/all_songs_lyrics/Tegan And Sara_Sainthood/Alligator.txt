Alligator Lyrics
Sensitive, it's true
Alligator tears cried over you

Over you, over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me, I'd sooner die without
Run around on me, die without

Relentless, yes it's true
My motormouth runs over you

Over you, over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me, I'd sooner die without
Run around on me, die without

Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Run around on me, I'd sooner die without
Run around on me, die without

No hissy fits, mind my manners
Won't make a scene over you

Over you, over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me, I'd sooner die without
Run around on me, die without

Rattled, yes it's true
Alligator tears spilled over you

Run around on me, I'd sooner die without
Run around on me, die without
Run around on me, I'd sooner die without
Run around on me, die without
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you4Embed
