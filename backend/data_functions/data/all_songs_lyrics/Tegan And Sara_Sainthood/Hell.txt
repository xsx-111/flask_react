Hell Lyrics
No, I'm not ready for a big bad step in their direction
No, I'm not ready for downtown trash, avoid collection
Four blocks, run and hide, don't walk alone at night
Cityscape, city change before they die
Four blocks, I should mention in a song if I wanna
Get along with change
Who doesn't want to change this?

I know you feel it too, these words get overused
When we get up and over it and over them
Up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too, it all seems so untrue
When you get up and over it and over them
Oh oh, hell no. Oh oh, hell no

No, we're not ready for fair distribution, just a terminal solution for
No, we're not ready for hell, hell no, for hell, hell no
Four days, wide awake, why slide along and say
Girl's afraid, girl will change, just move away
Four days that I mention in a song, move along, get ahead
Get her hand and bring her with you

I know you feel it too, these words get overused
When we get up and over it and over them
Up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too, it all seems so untrue
When you get up and over it and over them
Oh oh, hell no. Oh oh, hell no
Four ways to remove all the bad that we do
From the heart and the soul of the cities sad and cold
Four ways to collect what we say and what we save
To discard and discover a brand new way

I know you feel it too, these words get overused
When we get up and over it and over them
Up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too, it all seems so untrue
When you get up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too, these words get overused
When we get up and over it and over them
Up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too, it all seems so untrue
When you get up and over it and over them
Oh oh, hell no. Oh oh, hell no

Oh oh, hell no. Oh oh, hell noEmbed
