On Directing Lyrics
You're directing me
Your eyes focus like a microscope
Get the cuts you need
Eyes focused like a microscope

Go steady with me
I know it turns you off when I
I get talking like a teen
I get talking like a teen

You're directing me
You're dressed up, I lose my grip, my focus
Make those eyes at me
I lose my grip, I lose my focus

Go steady with me
I know it turns you off when I
I get talking like a teen
I get talking like a teen

You're directing me
Your eyes focus like a microscope
Get the cuts you need
Eyes focused like a microscope
You're directing me
You're dressed up, I lose my grip, my focus
Make those eyes at me
I lose my grip, I lose my focus

Go steady with me
I know it turns you off when I
I get talking like a teen
I get talking like a teenEmbed
