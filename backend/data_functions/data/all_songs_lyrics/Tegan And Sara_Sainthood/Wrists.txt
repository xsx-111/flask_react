Wrists Lyrics
Oh my wrists are weak but if I could lift your body
Out of a crash of the waves, out of bed or onto me
Working too hard gets me acting like a letter
So before you tell me you're not worth the worry, hurry
Hurry, hurry, hurry
I like to hurry when I'm wanting you
Hurry, hurry, hurry

Make me go without a word
Get so crazy when you shut up
Wake up in a panic, room is dark, you know this body
Could be this way with almost just anybody
So put me next to the window, put me next to the light
Hurry, hurry, hurry
I like to hurry when I'm wanting you
Hurry, hurry, hurry

Don't judge a book by the size of its wrist
Hurry, hurry
Are you undecided?
Hurry, hurry, hurry

Oh my ego's weak so thought if I could lift your body
And wake up out of air, the night's too short, you're onto me
Why am I always acting timid and too careful?
Please, before I tell you I'm not worth the worry, hurry
Hurry, hurry, hurry
I like to hurry when I'm wanting you
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Oh my wrists are weak, I carry weight like a shadow
So put me next to the window, put me next to the light
Hurry, hurry, hurry
I like to hurry when I'm wanting you
Hurry, hurry, hurry


Don't judge a book by the size of its wrist
Hurry hurry
Are you undecided?
Hurry hurry hurry
Are you undecided?
Hurry hurry
Are you undecided?
Hurry, hurry
