Sunset LyricsI see her when the sun is high
The clouds write her name across the sky
But, the boss man is giving me the eye
I'd better go to work, but I'll see her by and by
At sunset I'm gonna see my sweetheart
Gonna hold her so tight
At sunset I'm gonna see my baby
My baby tonight
I see the shadows on the run
I see the setting of the sun
At last my working day is done
The setting of the sun has finally come
It's sunset I'm gonna see my sweetheart
Gonna hold her so tight
It's sunset I'm gonna see my baby
My baby tonight
I see her in the twighlight standing there
The wind softly stirring in her hair
The sweetest fruit the earth can bear
So young so warm and so rare
It's sunset, at last I'm with my sweetheart
I'm holding her tight
It's sunset and now I'm with my baby
And she is mine tonightEmbed
