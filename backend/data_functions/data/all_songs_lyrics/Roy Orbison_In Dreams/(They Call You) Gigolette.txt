(They Call You) Gigolette LyricsOh, they call you Gigolette
They say that you're the Devil's pet
They say beware for you destroy
The heart and soul of every boy
They say that your lips are soft and warm
And they say that your touch has a magic charm
But that you're a butterfly
Flying from guy to guy
Yes you're known as Gigolette
Oh love them and leave them Gigolette
They say you're laugh when lovers cry
They say it's a kiss and then goodbye
They say that your heart is made of stone
And they say stay away leave you alone
Ah, that you're a fly by night
Many arms to hold you tight
But it's too late for me, too late now to forget
I'm under the spell of Gigolette
My chance to run away is past
I'm in your arms at last
So come on and hold me
Oh hold me close to you
Oh kiss me
Don't break my heart in two
Tomorrow you're may be out of sight
But tonight, tonight, tonight love me GigoletteEmbed
