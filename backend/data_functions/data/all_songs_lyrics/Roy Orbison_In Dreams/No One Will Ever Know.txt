No One Will Ever Know LyricsNo one will ever know my heart is breaking
Although a million teardrops start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
I'll miss you but no one will ever know
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
And realized our dreams could never be
I'll even make believe I never loved you
Then no-one will ever know the truth but me
No one will ever know how much I'm pining
Each time the past comes back to haunt me so
No-one will ever see the tears I'm hiding
Yes you've hurt me but no one will ever know
I'll tell them I've found true love with another
And that I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you
Then no-one will ever know the truth but meEmbed
