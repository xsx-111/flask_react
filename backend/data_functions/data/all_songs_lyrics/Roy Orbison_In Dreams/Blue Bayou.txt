Blue Bayou LyricsI feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou
Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back some day
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day
And the catfish play on Blue Bayou
All those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Go to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou
I'm going back some day
Gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Oh, that girl of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day gonna take away
This hurtin' inside
I'll never be blue
My dreams come true on Blue BayouEmbed
