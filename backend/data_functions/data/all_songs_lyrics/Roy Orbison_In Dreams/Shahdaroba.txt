Shahdaroba LyricsWhere the Nile flows
And the moon glows
On the silent sand
Of an ancient land
When a dream dies
And a heart cries
Shahdaroba
Is the word they whisper alone
Shahdaroba, Shahdaroba
Means the future is much better than the past
Shahdaroba, Shahdaroba
In the future you will find a love that lasts
So when tears flow
And you don't know
What on earth to do
And your world is blue
When your dream dies
And your heart cries
Shahdaroba
Fate knows what's best for you
Shahdaroba, Shahdaroba
Face the future and forget about the past
Shahdaroba, Shahdaroba
In the future you will find a love that lasts
