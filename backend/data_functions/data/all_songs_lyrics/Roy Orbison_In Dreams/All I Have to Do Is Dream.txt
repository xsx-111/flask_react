All I Have to Do Is Dream LyricsWhen I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream
When I feel blue in the night
And I want you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you all I have to do
Is dream
I can make you mine
Taste your lip of wine
Any time night or day
Only trouble is gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away
I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream
I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream
Dream, dream
Dream, dreamEmbed
