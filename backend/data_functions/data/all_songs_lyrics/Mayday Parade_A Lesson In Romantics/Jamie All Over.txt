Jamie All Over Lyrics
I had a dream last night
We drove out to see Las Vegas
We lost ourselves in the bright lights
I wish you could have seen us
Begging for change to get home
Or at least San Francisco
Let's put a ten on the high card
And spend a summer on the West Coast

Down and to the left
Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at
Be California's best
All I ask, all I ask

Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming
When all I ever wanted was to
Dream another sunset with you
If I roll over when it's over
I'll take this Cali sunrise with me
And wake up with the fondest memories

We made love by the ocean
As the waves crashed around you
Sunsets never were so bright
And the skies, never so blue
You opened up into my arms
And we laughed as I held you
I'll never go back to Georgia
Not at least 'til I have to
Down and to the left
Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at
Be California's best
All I ask, all I ask

Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming
When all I ever wanted was to
Dream another sunset with you
If I roll over when it's over
I'll take this Cali sunrise with me
And wake up with the fondest memories

I had a dream last night
We drove out to see Las Vegas
We lost ourselves in the bright lights

Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming
When all I ever wanted was to
Dream another sunset with you
If I roll over when it's over
I'll take this Cali sunrise with me
And wake up with the fondest memories
We made love by the ocean
As the waves crashed around you (memories)
Sunsets never were so bright
And the skies, never so blue (memories)
You opened up into my arms
And we laughed as I held you (memories)
I'll never go back to Georgia
Not at least 'til I have to
Down and to the left11Embed
