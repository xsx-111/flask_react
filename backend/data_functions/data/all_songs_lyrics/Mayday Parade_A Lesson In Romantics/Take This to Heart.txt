Take This to Heart Lyrics
Cause I'm a mess and you know that I can't help it
The drive home never seemed this long before
We're killing time just a little bit faster
And I swear we'll make it

But I can't tell you what I don't know
(Be mine tonight, be mine tonight)
The simple things that make my heart go
(Be mine tonight, be mine tonight)
But I can't tell you what I don't know
You'll have to wait
You'll have to wait

Stay safe, stay strong
And let me know that you'll be here while I am gone
Because I'm coming home, coming home tonight
So let's get this right
I said I'm coming home, coming home tonight

You said it hurts and you know that I believe you
Searching every little thing to find a way
To tell your heart just to wait a little longer
I swear we'll make it
But I can't tell you what I don't know
(Be mine tonight, be mine tonight)
The simple things that make my heart go
(Be mine tonight, be mine tonight)
But I can't tell you what I don't know
You'll have to wait
You'll have to wait

Stay safe, stay strong
And let me know that you'll be here while I am gone
Because I'm coming home, coming home tonight
So let's get this right
I said I'm coming home, coming home tonight

One more night, and we'll go spinning around the room
And dance with our hearts on fire
Cause every song is ours tonight
And if you love me so, I'm gonna tell the whole world
That it's greatest thing that happened to me
I finally found a good reason to come home

Stay safe, stay strong
And let me know that you'll be here while I am gone
Because I'm coming home, coming home tonight
So let's get this right
I said I'm coming home, coming home tonight1Embed
