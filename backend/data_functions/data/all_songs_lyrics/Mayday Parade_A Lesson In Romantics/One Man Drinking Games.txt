One Man Drinking Games LyricsAnd you thought it would be funny to keep me hanging in suspense
Then I'd run over to your house and I'd scale the chainlink fence
That borders your back yard and then I'd climb through your window
And I'd whisper that I love you as you fall out of your clothes
And we'd lay there in the darkness like the dream of you I had
Where we captured all the fireflies and knew what time we had
Could be counted on our fingertips and that almost made you cry
But you let me hold you tightly as we said all our goodbyes
May I say I loved you more
May I say I loved you more...
And it must've been an hour that I clutched you in my arms
And I must have said the right things because you instantly felt warm
And you heard my heart stop beating and you wanted not to cry
As your sympathetic whispers they told a tale of bad goodbyes
And you swore you saw me laughing, and I swore I saw you smile
And the time we've spent together was meant to last us quite a while
As I take this piece of you with me I'll carry to my grave
And knowing that for someone you're an angel sent to save
(Keep Breathing my angel, if you go down I go with you)
May I say I loved you more
(Keep breathing, keep breathing)
(Keep breathing my angel, if you go down I go with you)
May I say I loved you more
(Keep breathing, keep breathing)
So let's drink to memories we shared
Down one for all the hopes and cares
Here's two for being unaware that you're gone
Because before too long you'll be a memory
(let's drink to memories we shared)
Before too long you'll be a memory
(down one for all the hopes and cares)
Because before too long you'll be a memory
Here's two for being unaware
Because before too long you'll be a memory2Embed
