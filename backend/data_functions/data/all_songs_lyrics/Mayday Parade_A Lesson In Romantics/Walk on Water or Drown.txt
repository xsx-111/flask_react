Walk on Water or Drown LyricsWell, this hurts me more than I can stand to say
In just one sitting, you left the room so I could pray
So I'll pace the halls to see
If I could find a hole in something
Or maybe places to escape
Oh, and everybody knows this is the part
Of breaking down in anybody's arms
I'm reaching down and hoping this one's ours
God, please let this take
And then I fell into pieces and she fell into me
Saying, "Play me a song. It's been too long since I've heard you sing."
And you got here just in time
To let me know I was worth saving
If nothing more than for the hearts
Too proud to breathe
But I'm too scared to say the things worth saying
Who knew this trip would be this hard?
As I'm looking to the sky to count the stars
I wonder if you see them where you are
I'm tied above my knees
And pray tomorrow brings no pain
And then I fell into pieces and she fell into me
Saying, "Play me a song. It's been too long since I've heard you sing."
And yeah, we all fall to pieces
But at least you fell to me
But this is a wrong night
Tell me goodnight and let it go
I stayed here and you just prayed
My head would clear and I'd stay safe
The pieces left that love has changed just saved everything
Oh, and everybody knows this is the part
Of breaking down in anybody's arms
I'm reaching down and hoping this one's ours
God, please let this take
And then I fell into pieces and she fell into me
Saying, "Play me a song. It's been too long since I've heard you sing."
And then I fell into pieces and she fell into me
Saying, "Play me a song. It's been too long since I've heard you sing."
And yeah, we all fall to pieces
But at least you fell to me
But this is a wrong night
Tell me goodnight and let it go, oh1Embed
