Spying Glass Lyrics
You live in the city
You mind you own business
What you see you don't see
Yet some people, they always see
They never mind their own business
You move to the country
You live in the hills
You think you're far from the wicked
When you check it dem a use spying glass
They want to know all your business
You live in the city
You stay by yourself
You avoid bad company
Still some people, they brand you yard
Just because you are Rasta
You live in the city
You stay by yourself
You avoid all wickedness
Still some people, they brand you yard
Just because you are Rasta

Yes some people they brand you yard
Just because you are Rasta

You live in the city
You stay by yourself
You avoid all wickedness
Still some people, they brand you yard
Just because you are Rasta
You move to the country
You live in the hills
You avoid all wickedness
When you check it dem a use spying glass
They want to know Rasta business

You live in the city
You mind you own business
What you see you don't see
Yet some people, they always see
They never mind their own businessEmbed
