Money Money LyricsMoney, money, money, money
Is the root of all evil
Money, money, money, people
Is the root of all evil
You work for a man and you get no pay
Brother, don't do nothing wrong
Don't let no one, influence you
When trouble come, it's you all alone
Money, money, money, people
Is the root of all evil
Money, money, money, tell you
Is the root of all evil
Some steal it, some kill for it
Some do inequity for it
It makes friends, it break friends
Judas betrayed Christ for it
Money, money, money, tell you
Is the root of all evil
Money, money, money, people
Is the root of all evil
(..)
Money money!
Some steal it, some kill for it
Some do inequity for it
It makes friends, it break friends
Judas betrayed Christ for it
Money, money, money, people
The root of all evil
Money, money, money, tell you
The root of all evil
We can't live without it
We gotta buy food to eat
It's good and it's bad
Yet we can't live without itEmbed
