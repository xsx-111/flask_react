Search for More Lyrics
We don't feel at all
With our hands out
We beg for more
And you clearly died when I heard the call
You black out
I search for more

You fall in love
Don't waste it all
It won't be long

But if I can't make it back
Will I know you're not alone and fading?
Do we see the same blue eyes?
If I gave nothing back
You think you know whats coming till you're fading
Don't close your eyes

Does it hurt at all
To find out
You're nothing more?
I waited night after night after night
Can you come out?
I thirst for more


But if I can't make it back
Will I know you're not alone and fading?
Do we see the same blue eyes?
If I gave nothing back
You think you know whats coming till you're fading
Just close your eyesEmbed
