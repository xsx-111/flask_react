Come In This Light LyricsCome in this light
You only need to feel loved
But you let the dark in
When you open up the door
But you don't know what it's like
To lose
You don't know what it's like to lose
How long is life?
You only need to feel loved
But you kept it all in
And you cut this heart out
But you don't know what it's like
To lose
But you don't know what it's like to loseEmbed
