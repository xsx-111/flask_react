Breathe, Desperately LyricsI was once a quiet boy
Cleaning out my wounds but I
Never could keep my mouth shut
When I needed to
I could try to pry it loose
But the stone won't move
And I wanna try to rip it out
But I've grown to love this thing too much
Have I become the man that I hated once
Or have my thoughts become clouded
By things I used to fear the most?
And is my heart full of the ashes I heard about?
Have I become the missing person
I've been trying to get you all to forget?
(Buried alive now, buried alive now
Buried alive now, cover your eyes now) x2
We breathe so desperately
As if it's the only thing we need
And we don't care if it's not
Breathing honestly
We're burning our lungs with it
And we don't care
We don't care at all
When you breathe the air
It tastes like medicine
And overwhelming days
Are nothing that I can't hide
When you walk alone you think such foolish things
And so disappointed we are
With no one around to love
(Buried alive now, buried alive now
Buried alive now, cover your eyes now) x4
We breathe so desperately
As if it's the only thing we need
And we don't care if it's not
Breathing honestly
We're burning our lungs with it
And we don't care
We don't care at allEmbed
