Am I Alive LyricsWhen it shakes your bones is it alright
When the closet door is the only source of light?
And the whole ride home you were mine
'til the front door closes leavin' me to fight back all these things that I've been feelin'
Like a lost cause
When I know you're trying hard to make me right
And I'm holding out my hand to you
But you slip right through my fingers
And I need you to reassure me I'm alive
Am I alive 4x
Can you take me home, if it's alright?
I can't look away but I don't wanna meet your eyes
I wish I'd been a little more careful with the things I chose to give away
But if I can't make this up to you I'll find some way to make it through these feelings
Like a lost cause
When I know you're trying hard to make me right
And I'm holding out my hand to you
But you slip right thru my fingers
And I need you to reassure me I'm alive
Am I alive 8x
I hear them whisper so softly
Tellin' me not hold my breath
They're closer
The demons
And I can't fight 'em off without you I've been feelin'
Like a lost cause
When I know you're working hard to make me right
And I'm holding out my hand to you
But you slip right thru my fingers
And I need you to reassure me I'm alive
