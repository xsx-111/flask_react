Ghost LyricsI became everything and all at once I was nothing
I couldn't take anymore
Could I hold it in my hands?
I can taste it on my tongue
But I couldn't keep it all in my grasp
Too many times I was collapsing
I could only get so far
Who am I to expect anything?
If you never make another sound
How can I hope to ever find you now?
If I'm gone before I hit the ground
How can I hope to be where you are?
When you're caught inside when the world just passes
It takes too long to slow down
You're barely alive
I used to be you and I can't go back
Now I'm a ghost of what I once was
Now I'm a ghost of what I once was
So I began to hate everything
All at once I was running
But I couldn't fake it anymore
Could you feel me screaming out?
Were you trying to shake me out of my sleep?
And if you never make another sound
How can I hope to ever find you now?
And if I'm gone before I hit the ground
How can I hope to be where you are?
When you're caught inside when the world just passes
It takes too long to slow down
You're barely alive
I used to be you and I can't go back
Now I'm a ghost of what I once was
Now I'm a ghost of what I once was
I could always tell you were getting away from me
But how could I let you see?
It's so hard to love anything
Now I'm a ghost of what I once was
Now I'm a ghost of what I once was
Now I'm a ghost of what I once was
Now I'm a ghostEmbed
