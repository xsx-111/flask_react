Runner LyricsWhen you're old enough
When you've been through it
You won't know what it's like
You can't see things the same
But you're closer now
Did you close your eyes
Did I close them first
You weren't strong enough
I'm no stronger than you
But the years take their toll on us all
I'm starting to see why you drifted away after all
And no one explains to you where the things go that you love
Til they've already gone
You held on for us
The house gathered dust
We were selfish then
And we held onto things
But they've all gone now
Did I take too long
Did I ask too much
I didn't love you as much as I could
And the silence is killing me now
I'm starting to see why you drifted away after all
And no one explains to you where the things go that you love
How many times will I try to pretend that you're here
And I had a few questions I never got to ask you in time
Cause you'd already gone1Embed
