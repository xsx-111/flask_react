Fog LyricsWho do you want to be now that they're gone?
You can't help but feel a little bit left out of it
But if the others can't see that you're not well
Then to hell with them
You never needed anyone else
And you sail on alone
In this fog
But you don't know anyone
At all
Did you try to give away your love?
You can't always get it right the first time
But if you get up now you can try to survive
I've been trying to figure it out my whole life
And you sail on alone
In this fog
But you don't know anyone
At all. (x2)
And you'll never know anyone now
When you hurt so much
And you don't know why
And you can't seem to find anyone
But you take your time
And i won't ask why
And you don't have to be anyone
And you sail on alone
In this fog
But you don't know anyone
At allEmbed
