Label This Love LyricsLabel this love
Put it in a jar, and deliver
Cradle my heart
Get the beating out, and let it sleep
Filter this blood
Get the spirit out, young believers
Shelter this one, lay it on the bed, and let it sleep
Until I love again
Come on, let me in
Until I love again, you belong in your own skin
You belong, you belong in your own skin (x2)
They took me alive
Kept me out of sight from the strangers
You can be alone now, you can hide your eyes and let it be
Until I love again
Come on, let me in (x2)
I won't hurt so hard with the curtains drawn
And you know, I know, I know, you don't wanna talk
Did I love again? Come on, let me in
Did I love again? You belong in your own skinEmbed
