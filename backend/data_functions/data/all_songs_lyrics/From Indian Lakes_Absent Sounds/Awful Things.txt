Awful Things Lyrics(Do do da, do do da
Do do da, do do...)
My thoughts are slowly coming out loud
I flinch each time I hear them out loud
I guess I know what it's like now
To be honest
To see what I'm hiding
In the closet
Do I still look the same to you now
Am I still clean enough?
(Do do da, do do da...)
We slowly sink into cigarette ash
You sleep while I tip the bottle back
I guess we've seen what it's like now
To be lovers
To scream that we're nothing
Without each other
Can I lay back and close my eyes
And pretend you're mine?
(Do do da, do do da...)
Have we made a fool of love?
Have we taken all the good away?
If we're not supposed to be alone
Then I'm begging you to stay
Here
I saw your face in the mirror last night
Blood stained your clothes
Bags under your eyes
I guess you've heard what I'm like now
Just a body
You're haunting our bedroom
And the hallway
And I still hear your voice in my head
Saying awful thingsEmbed
