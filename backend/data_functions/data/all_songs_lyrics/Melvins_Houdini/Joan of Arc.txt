Joan of Arc LyricsPlatoon
Fall in!
Come on, you knuckleheads
Move it, move it, move it
Moss in the mornin', lets you in
Is it a field day, make me sin
It's only warm, I let you stay
Moss in the mornin', might be way
Chase!
Learned
Finely
Earn your ray
Might be they
Lucky day
No!
How could you ever moss it down
Extra often is not my sound
She better hope that you better mind
Mix me over my, let be wide! (Why!)Embed
