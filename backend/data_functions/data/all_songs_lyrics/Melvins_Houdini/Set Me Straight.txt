Set Me Straight Lyrics
I know something that you would never believe
I wish I was able to finally make you agree

Now
You set me straight
You told me things
That erase my slate
I'll do what you say
As long as you feel
And I can be had
Without sex appeal

I know something that you would never believe
I wish I was able to finally make you agree
It's times like this, baby, that makes it all seem worthwhile
I'm lookin' for something that I can find in a smile

Now
You set me straight
You told me things
That erase my slate
I'll do what you say
As long as you feel
That I can be had
Without sex appealEmbed
