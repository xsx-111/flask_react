Lizzy Lyrics
I'm sin done in water
You might be over hill
He's somebody's daughter
As far as Liz well knows
Send me a black one
Other than a big sun
Open with a castrate
A mystery mind
He sits her with father
We seem so in a two
Open up a C.A.T. scan
White leather free land
Wishy little be scar
Half-made mind
Elvis had a daughter
Not half-boned siksura
Heavy Betty big bone
Little kitty fig bomb
I'm no feet less
Give me one
Eat more with your collar
Calling m-m-m-me in May
Time is a big one
Only have to free us all
Misery to hope laid
Have them with the bong hit
Exit measured one seive
And I'm break and kickin Gary
Wringin' with the clothes bend
I hang my bong4Embed
