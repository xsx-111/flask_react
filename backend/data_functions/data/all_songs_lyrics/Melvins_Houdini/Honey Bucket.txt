Honey Bucket LyricsEight times a felon for fire
Like cobalt cast and clean
I got a motor felt the wheel
Real fast and fear
Try, jack it, black it for more
Handcuffs with special keys
Triple lies and been down defiled
It's a vsi
Throw a case of plasticine down
Baby I can immolate
And it's rotten in my rounds
Sister's in my way
I'm as fast as my home town
Green glass and most of all
Been around this foreign cage
