Sky Pup LyricsNext time you gimme your gaze
Think about mork sinny goal
That tricky grass for me
Aw, T.V., you're in my nose
Oh, baby, baby, big red bally
Ain't it just a big ol' ball?
My baby, you're not crazy
Might be you're lone
*cough cough*
*choke*
Come on, gimme a drag
Bambino, see your diamond landing
Well baby, you're not so mean
Tell you like a horny nuclear
This damn baby, she wants my skillo
Hawk sooner, I'm a witness
You like, like...hog
Lazy bread in your cocktail
Kurt mazy, you're not bad
My only dude, you are my best friend
She's cat damned
Damn, damned easy
My head's a big smileEmbed
