Pearl Bomb LyricsCroak radio gives me the shakes
That's no surprise
'Cause I can feel both barrels of your eyes
Understand what I'm sayin', just like a hole beat red
You think I'm bine
You take a leg
You feel a nice teen tone bime-b-b-bye
Left dog
See big, boy
After your dirty little tee bits
All in seein' my meat
I took a team of you
Your body
For leftover, you're sane
Green water like a sugarback, I bet your bine
Read both bladder steps of foamy decline
Limbo, lacky, sucker
Yes, her limbo baba's at home
And they cry like half-dead dog bugEmbed
