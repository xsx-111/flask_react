Teet LyricsI've seen a friend go ride, you host away the peel
My leavin' bedroom for my carbon wheel
Joke mister, join the Navy, ain't so sad in awe
Half of the jay gone century, cat the call
Toast no indee gone aim, no want to be a ray
She's not afraid to fear more chaste with me
Ask not and you won't find it, ride
Actin' like over gentry
Maybe you're in hair
Ace like a big and hairy happy sad
Toast no indee gone aim, no want to be a ray
She's not afraid to fear more chaste with me
Ask not and you won't find it, rideEmbed
