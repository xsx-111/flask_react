Gotta Love It LyricsShocking!
Psychedelic sandwich

Any way you can feel it
You shouldn't try to conceal it baby
You got to make up your mind (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Any way I can steal it
Any way you can deal it to me
You know the pleasure's all mine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You got to love it
You better own it
You got to love it
And God knows it
You got to shu uh shove it
I'm gonna make things happen
Going around and round, around and, around and
Around and, around and, around and, around and, around and, around and that's right

I wanna say you're a firecracker
I wanna say you're switchblade knife
You make your sex a career  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Comin' down from an all-night tripper
Pull your foot from the ruby slipper
'Cause you can't get there from here (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got to love it
You better own it
You got to love it
And God knows it
You got to shu uh shove it
I'm gonna make things happen
Going around and round, around and, around and
Around and, around and, around and, around and, around and, around...

I got this feeling deep inside my gut
Overwhelming feeling of I know not what
One thing's for sure, I ain't got time for those who can't relate


You got to learn to love the midnight madness
You got to revel in the good and badness
If ying and yang is your thing (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What I gotta do to try and reach you
Is it for real or just a double feature
So let's go throw the I Ching (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You got to love it
You wanna own it
You got to love it
And God knows it
You got to shu uh shove it
I'm gonna make things happen
Going around and round, around and, around and
Around and, around and, around and, around and, around and, around...
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
You got to love it
Yeah, yeah, oohEmbed
