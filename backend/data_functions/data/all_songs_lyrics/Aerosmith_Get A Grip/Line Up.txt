Line Up Lyrics
If you think that you're strong
Want to fight well come on
And line up (Line up)
When the going gets tough
And your talk ainâ€™t enough
Line up (Line up)

We got to get up, get out before they get us down
'cause living up against the wall, yeah
Has got us locked up
Come on and line up (Line up)
So don't be surprised when they pull the wool over your eyes
You don't get funked up

If you got all the stuff
And you can't get enough
Then line up (Line up)
If you're out on a limb
And you wanna come in
Then line up, yeah (Line up)

You're head's down, sitting 'round
Pick your face up off the ground
And get yourself together, baby
And learn to stand tough
Come on and line up (Line up)
We better get to it instead of just standing around
It's time to get down
Come on, Joe!
Aw yeah

If you're playing to win
And your only way in
Is line up (Line up)
If we all want to live
And we all gotta give
Line up (Line up)

We got to get up, get out before they get us down
Because living up against the wall, yeah
Has got us locked up
Come on and line up (Line up)
You better get to it instead of just standing around
Yeah, it's time to get down
Yeah, yeah

If you got all the stuff
And you can't get enough
Then line up (Line up)
Line up (Line up)
If you're out on a limb
And you wanna come in
Then line up (Line up)
Line up (Line up)
Line up (Line up)
You got to get yourself together
Line up (Line up)
You got to stand up and be counted
Line up (Line up)
You got to love, you got to love
Line up (Line up)
You got to love, you got to love
