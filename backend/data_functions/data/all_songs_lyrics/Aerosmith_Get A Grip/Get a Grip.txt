Get a Grip Lyrics
Got to get a grip
Skin and bones, it isn’t such a pity
If you think I'm vain, better shut your lips
I can't explain how to be fat city
You got to live large, got to let it rip

Skin and bones, it isn’t such a pity
Don't you give me no flack, honey shut your lip
You got to have stones if you're living in the city
If you want to hang loose got to get a grip rip

Once upon a crime I thought I was cool but I don't want to brag
Once I crossed the line I think I must have zigged when I should have zagged

Got to get a grip
Skin and bones, it isn’t such a pity
If you think I'm vein, better shut your lips
I can't explain how to be fat city
You got to live large, got to let it rip

Same old same old every day
If things don't change you're just gonna rot
Because if you do what you've always done
You'll always get what you always got
Uh, could that be nothing?
Got to get a grip
Skin and bones, it isn’t such a pity
If you think I'm vein, better shut your lips
I can't explain how to be fat city
You got to live large, got to let it rip

Skin and bones, it isn’t such a pity
Don't give me no flack, honey shut your lip
You got to have stones if you're living in the city
If you want to hang loose got to get a grip rip
Who knows for sure yeah without a doubt
What goes on when the lights go out
Or who pulls in when I pull out
And what's a one eyed trouser trout?
I was so short sighted
Now the wrong been righted
I feel so delighted
I get so excited
Skin and bones, it isn’t such a pity
If you think I'm vain, better shut you lip
I can't explain how to be fat city
You got to live large, got to let it rip
Skin and bones, it isn’t such a pity
Don't give me no flack, honey shut your lip
You got to have stones if you're living in the city
If you want to hang loose got to get a grip rip
You want to get high in a New York minute
Choke that smoke, honey crack the whip
Your head gets dead, yea as long as you're in it
You want to hang loose, got to get a grip

Skin and bones, it isn’t such a pity
Don't give me no flack, honey shut your lip
You got to have stones if you're living in the city
If you want to hang loose got to get a grip ripEmbed
