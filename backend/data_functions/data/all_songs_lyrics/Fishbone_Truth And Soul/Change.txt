Change LyricsThere's a light on a hill
That's far out in the distance
And it calls out my name
It calls out for a change
Far away voices
That want their own choices
Sigh for a plea
As it calls out for a change
Ooh Change
Ooh Change
Ooh...
To the root of Mankind
It bellows out bitter winds
Youth cry out for today
Strength to cry for a change
Yet it seems clear to me
It pounds inside my soul
Why don't we all see
We can cry out for a change
Ooh Change
Ooh Change
Ooh...
We can change today (X3)
Deep inside our hearts
There's a love
You can feel it
It's a love that assures
We can cry out for a change
The dark clouds that did dance
To the blue skies here before me
Make it plain to my eyes
We can cry out for a change
Ooh Change
Ooh Change
Ooh...Embed
