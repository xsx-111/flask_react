Question Of Life LyricsI saw the god spread his arms, across the imperfect sky
The clouds rolled across the full moon, tattooed in the sky
For the eye tattooed in the sky judged the planets plea
And I was just a humble man and feared God in his sight
The Light
A question - rose from my soul
A question - I began to hold
A pitchfork - pinned to my chest
Will I, I not pass the test
Will I, I not pass the test
A disease of clouds formed over the sea
The Angel was cruisin' down so that I could see
The roses in his eyes
He would give me, Lord
The New Age not the winter
The Ice Age was the last page
You must present a P.M.A. (Positive Mental Attitude)
For we all dance for freedom sake
Sake, sake, sake...
To tie the shoelace of life in place
To change the mind from a negative state, Yeh!
A question - rose from my soul
A question - I began to hold
A pitchfork - pinned to my chest
Will I, I not pass the test
Will I, I not pass the test
The Angel began to say to me
As the roses set me free, set me free
You must recite this throughout the land or else
You will be snuffed and canned, snuffed and canned
You musn't wrong the right
Yoo musn't dark the Light
Yu must dove the vulture
U must do or die
Wow I was shakin'
A question shake shake shake
Wow I was shakin'
A question shake shake shake
Alright !Embed
