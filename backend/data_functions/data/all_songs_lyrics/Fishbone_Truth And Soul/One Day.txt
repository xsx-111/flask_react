One Day LyricsWaitin' for the one day
Are we waitin' for the one day?
We are waitin' in restaurants
Over there!
We are waitin' in cars
Somewhere over there!
We are waitin' in bathrooms
Around here!
We are waitin' in bars

Waitin' for the one day
Waitin' for the one day
Yeah! Yeah! Waitin' for! Waitin' for...
Waitin' for the one day
Are we waitin' for the one day?
Waitin' in bootcamps
In the country somewhere!
Waitin' in front of t.v.'s in living rooms
Somewhere around here!
Waitin' in heaven
Uh, uh, uh, somewhere up there...
Waitin' in hell
Somewhere down there...
Waitin' for the one day
Waitin' for the one day
Yeah! Yeah! Waitin' for! Waitin' for...
The time has come for...
Revelation
Masculination

Excitation
Femalization
The time is gone for...
Desegregation

Waitin' for the one day
Waitin' for the one day
Yeah! Yeah! Waitin' for! Waitin' for...Embed
