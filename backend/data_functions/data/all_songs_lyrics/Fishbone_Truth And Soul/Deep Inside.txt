Deep Inside LyricsRich Ass
High Klass
Don't bother me and I won't realize your crime
Two faced
You're out of place
You can't rock out because you ain't the kind
Well if you were on the other side of the fence
Well maybe you'd understand
I may freak you out with my raw look
'Cause I just got the feelin' Man !
Brain Washed
You're Lost
Your blindness can't be helped anyway
Your Cash
My Clash
It makes me able to say
It makes me able to say
You got the prestige status
You've got the majority mass
Plus you've got a blender by General Motors
And a Tonka Toy dump truck up your ass
You'll never look the way I feel
You'll never feel the look in my eyes
Cause I've got the feelin' swimming in my bones
And it's takin over Deep Inside
It's takin' over Deep Inside (repeat)Embed
