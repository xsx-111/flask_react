Mighty Long Way LyricsSaid I'm shakin' in my shoes sometimes
And all alone I get the blues sometimes
And I'm far away from home, it seems so far, so far away
Many moons and many days
You know many things are on my mind
I search and search for answers I can't find
Then my people I will seek
They listen when I speak
Believe me when I say
Me and my friends go a mighty long way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah !!!
There's nothing that can make this bond to break
And if it comes along it must be strong
Believe me when I say
Me and my friends go a mighty long way
Well I look into the cloudy sky
And cleanse my soul as the heavens cry
My life like a rolling stone
Up and down the hills
It breaks my ass like a window sill
And if I had to do it all by myself
There be a threat to my mental health
But there's no need to run and hide
When folks are by my side
Believe me when I say
Me and my friends go a mighty long way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah !!!
There's nothing that could make this bond to break
And don't even try unless you're ready to die
Believe me when I say
Me and my friends go a mighty long way
Believe my when I say
We go a mighty long wayEmbed
