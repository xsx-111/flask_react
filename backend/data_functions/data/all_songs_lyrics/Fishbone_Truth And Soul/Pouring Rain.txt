Pouring Rain LyricsThe sun will shine on brighter
And the wind will always blow
Some think life's a breeze
Others feel love is sin
I've found beauty in dancing stars
To you, your dreams may be a farce
And you think that you can't feel pain?
And you think we can't feel at all
Can you sing out in the pouring rain
Can you sing out, can you sing out
He had one foot in the gutter
Another on dry land
His ship sailed without him
Across life's burning sands
He cried out in the distance
And no one, no one heard a word
For a prophet's not respected in his own world
Can you sing out in the pouring rain
Can you sing out, can you sing out
And all the things I've said
And all these things
And all the things I've said
That you doubt and disbelieve
Are shoved back in your face
By the spite of mankind's greed
You choose to close you eyes
And the rest of the world will bleed
You choose to close your eyes
And the rest of the world will bleed
Can you sing out in the pouring rain
Can you sing
