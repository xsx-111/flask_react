This Old Heartache LyricsIt's been a month of Sunday's since I laid eyes on you
Have you changed your ways or have you even tried to
I wish I could kill all this worry and regret
But I am haunted still by the things I can't forget

It's hard to take, this old heartache
It's drivin' me out of my mind
I can't take it and I can't shake it
And it lives with me all the time
People look at me and they think I've got it all
I'm happy and go lucky and I'll never take a fall
What they never see when they look from the outside
Is the thing that tortures me and eats me up inside

It's hard to take, this old heartache
It's drivin' me out of my mind
I can't take it and I can't shake it
And it lives with me all the time
You think that I don't care hut you don't have a clue
Life is never fair, no matter what you do
And if you only knew az the thoughts I live with every day
And the peace of mind it costs and the hell I have to pay
It's hard to take, this old heartache
It's drivin' me out of my mind
I can't take it and I can't shake it
And it lives with me all the time
Yeah, it lives with me all the timeEmbed
