Compassion Lyrics
Have compassion for everyone you meet
Even if they don’t want it
What seems conceit is always a sign
Always a sign, always a sign
For those you encounter, have compassion
Even if they don’t want it
What seems bad manners is always a sign
Always a sign, always a sign

Always a sign of things no ears have heard
Always a sign of things no eyes have seen
You do not know what wars are going on
Down there, where the spirit meets the bone
Down there, where the spirit meets the bone
Down where the spirit meets the bone

For everyone you listen to, have compassion
Even if they don’t want it
What seems cynicism is always a sign
Always a sign, always a sign

Always a sign of things no ears have heard
Always a sign of things no eyes have seen
You do not know What wars are going on
Down there, where the spirit meets the bone
Down there, where the spirit meets the bone
Down where the spirit meets the bone
Down there, where the spirit meets the bone
Down there, where the spirit meets the bone
Down where the spirit meets the boneEmbed
