Burning Bridges Lyrics
Sometimes the best intentions are never truly met
And all your expectations, are never what you get
You’ll never say why, or come up with a reason
You’ve been weakened by a string of bad decisions

Burning bridges, burning 'em down
Burning bridges, burning 'em down
Burning bridges, burning 'em down
Burning bridges, burning 'em down

Now you’ve won and you lost it
You won’t put of a fight
I can add you to my list of things
That keep it me at night
You’re the saddest story that's ever been told
And I stand back and watch as
The tragedy unfolds

Burning bridges, burning 'em down
Burning bridges, burning 'em down
Burning bridges, burning 'em down
Burning bridges, burning 'em down
If there ever was a time, it's now
It might not come again
You have to chose which eyes to look through in the end
The loveliest flowers will die in a drought
And your loneliest hours will be
Worse than you ever thought

Burning bridges, burning 'em down
Burning bridges, burning 'em down
Burning bridges, burning 'em down
Burning bridges, burning 'em down
Burning bridges, (burning 'em down)
Burning bridges, (burning 'em down)
Burning bridges (burning 'em down)
Burning bridges (aaah)
Why you wanna, why you wanna burn bridges?
Why you wanna, why you wanna burn this bridge?
Why you wanna burn this bridge?
Why you wanna burn it down?Embed
