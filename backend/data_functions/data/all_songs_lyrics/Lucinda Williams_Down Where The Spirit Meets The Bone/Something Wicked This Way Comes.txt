Something Wicked This Way Comes LyricsSomething wicked this way comes
The likes of which you've never known
Hellfire and brimstone
Something wicked this way comes
He is hiding underneath
The grass beneath your feet
And the moss up on the stones
Something wicked this way comes
No love has he
He will show you no mercy
He will make you his home
Something wicked this way comes
He invites you to come in
And drink with him
He won't be alone
Something wicked this way comes
You will fall from grace
And you may never see his face
He was cast out of heaven
Something wicked this way comes
Something wicked this way comes
The likes of which you've never known
Hellfire and brimstone
Something wicked this way comes
Something wicked
Mighty wicked
Something wicked
Mighty wicked
Something wicked
Mighty wicked
No mercy
No mercy
No love
No love
No mercy, mercy
No mercy
Something wicked
Mighty wicked
Something wicked
Mighty wicked
Something wicked
Mighty wickedEmbed
