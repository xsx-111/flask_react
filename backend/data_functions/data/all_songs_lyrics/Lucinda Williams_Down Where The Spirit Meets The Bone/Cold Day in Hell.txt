Cold Day in Hell LyricsBefore I trust you again
Before you use me again
Before I lust for you again
Before you confuse me again
It'll be a cold, cold day in hell
It'll be a cold, cold day in hell
Before I run with you again
Before you drag me down again
Before I have fun with you again
Before I stand with you again
It'll be a cold, cold day in hell
Yeah it'll be a cold, cold day in hell
You might have been searching for heaven
But heaven don't live here no more
Yeah you thought you could make it to heaven
But honey heaven done closed the door
Before I walk with you again
Before you mess me up again
Before I talk to you again
Before you wreck my heart again
It'll be a cold, cold day in hell
Yeah it'll be a cold, cold day in hell
Before you wrong me again
Before I touch you again
Before I long for you again
And give that much to you again
It'll be a cold, cold day in hell
Yeah it'll be a cold, cold day in hell
It'll be a cold, cold day in hell
It'll be a cold, cold day in hell
It'll be a cold, cold day in hellEmbed
