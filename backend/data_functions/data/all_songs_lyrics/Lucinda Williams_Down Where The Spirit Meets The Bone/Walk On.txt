Walk On LyricsWalk on, come on girl, walk on
Walk on, come on girl, walk on
You got the world in the palm of your hand
You gotta make them understand
That you're the lead singer in the band
So walk on
Come on girl walk on
They don't make 'em any sweeter than you
Anyone can tell that's true
So you do what you gotta do
And walk on
Come on girl walk on
I know you're fighting an uphill battle
But you'll win with a little struggle
'Cause you're really not that fragile
So walk on
Come on girl walk on
I know you can be the best
You can run ahead of all the rest
Yeah, I know you can pass the test
So walk on
Come on girl walk on
Life is full of heartbreak
But it's never more than you can take
It's nothing you can't shake a stick at
So walk on
Come on girl walk on
People gonna treat you unkind
But you don't pay 'em any mind
And I am here to remind you
So walk on
Come on girl walk on
Yeah walk on
Come on girl walk on
Come on girl
Come on girl
Come on girl
Come on girl
Come on girl
Come on girlEmbed
