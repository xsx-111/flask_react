East Side of Town LyricsYou think you got problems
You don't know the half of it
I hear you talk about your millions and your politics
You wanna cross the poverty line
And then you want to come have a look around
So why you don't come find me
I'm on east side of town
You think you're Mr. Do-Good
But you don't know what you talking bout
When you find yourself in my neighborhood
You can't wait to get the hell out
You wanna see what it means to suffer
You wanna see what it means to be down
Then why don't you come over
To the east side of town
You think your dogs are mean
But you ain't see nothin' yet
I 'll show you things you've never seen and you won't forget
You wanna see how the other half lives
You wanna see how we get around
Why don't you come visit on then east side of town
You got your ideas and your visions
And you say you sympathize
You look but you don't listen
There's no empathy in your eyes
You make deals and promises
And everybody bow down
And now you wanna come shake my hand
On the east side of town
So why you don't come find me
On the east side of town
Why don't you come over
To the east side of town
Why don't you come visit
The east side of town
Come on over
To the east side of townEmbed
