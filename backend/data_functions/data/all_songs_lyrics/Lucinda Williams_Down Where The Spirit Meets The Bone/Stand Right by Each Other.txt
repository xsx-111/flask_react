Stand Right by Each Other LyricsSomething destructive going on, hey can you feel it, baby?
Tell me what you want me to do
It's not constructive to cry as much as I cry, baby
Tell me what you want me to do
We gotta stand right by each other
Gotta try harder baby
I gotta stand right by you
And you gotta stand right by me

We gotta stand right by each other
Gotta try harder, baby
I gotta stand right by you
And you gotta stand right by me
I gotta push myself, but you gotta push yourself
I can't do it, baby, all by myself
We can make it better, baby, make a happier home
But you gotta help me, I can't do it alone

We gotta stand right by each other
Gotta try harder, baby
I gotta stand right by you
And you gotta stand right by me
We gotta stand right by each other
Gotta try harder, baby
I gotta stand right by you
And you gotta stand right by me
Baby, I care too much, I won't give up that easy
So, c'mon, give me that much, baby, don't give up on me
If you could see yourself, the way I see you, baby
Then you would see for yourself why I don't want nobody else
We gotta stand right by each other
Gotta try harder, baby
I gotta stand right by you
And you gotta stand right by me
We gotta stand right by each other
Gotta try harder, baby
I gotta stand right by you
And you gotta stand right by me
Baby, this is a warning sign and we got to fight it this time
Because it's threatening to kill everything we got
And we got too much at stake
Gotta do whatever it takes
I don't us want to break up
So, let's kiss and make up
We gotta stand right by each other
Gotta try harder, baby
I gotta stand right by you
And you gotta stand right by me
We gotta stand right by each other
Gotta try harder, baby
I gotta stand right by you
And you gotta stand right by meEmbed
