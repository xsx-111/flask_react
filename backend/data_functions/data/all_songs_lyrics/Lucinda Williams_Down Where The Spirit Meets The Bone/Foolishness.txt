Foolishness LyricsAll of this foolishness in my life
All of this foolishness in my life
Don't need it
What I do in my own time
Is none of your business and all of mine
All of this foolishness
All of this foolishness in my life
All of you liars in my life
All of your liars in my life
Don't need you
You can talk all trash you want
But I know the truth even if you don't
None of you liars in my life
None of you liars in my life
None of your pie in the sky
None of your pie in the sky
Don't need it
No matter how you go or where
I ain't gonna follow you anywhere
No one of your pie in the sky
No one of your pie in the sky
All of you fear-mongers in my life
All of you fear-mongers in my life
You can try to scare me down
But I know how to stand my own ground
None of you fear-mongers in my life
None of you fear-mongers in my life
All of this foolishness in my life
All of this foolishness in my life
What I do in my own time
Is none of your business and all of mine
None of this foolishness in my life
None of this foolishness in my life
All of this foolishness
All of your liars
All you talk about is pie in the sky
All of you feel-mongers
Foolishness
I don't need you liars
I don't need your pie in the sky
I don't need your fear-mongering
I don't need your foolishness
All of this foolishness
Is nothing but foolishness
Is nothing but foolishness
Is nothing but foolishness
Is nothing but foolishness
Is nothing but your foolishness
Is nothing but your foolishnessEmbed
