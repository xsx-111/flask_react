When I Look at the World LyricsI've been out of luck
I've been talked about
I've been locked up
I've been shut out
I've had some bad dreams
I've been feeling regret
I've made a mess of things
And been a total wreck
I've been disrespected
And taken for a ride
I've been rejected
And had my patience tried

But then I look at the world
In all its glory
I look at the world
And it's a different story
Each time I look at the world
I've been used and out of work
Been abused
I've been lied to
I've been left behind
I've been misunderstood
I've been out of my mind
And not feeling good
I've been lost
I've been turned away
I've paid the cost
It's been hell to pay
And then I look at the world
In all its glory
I look at the world
And it's a different story
Each time I look at the world
I've been unforgiven
I've been let down
I've had the truth hit
I've been kicked around
I've been wasted
I've been on the brink
I've had my faith tested and my spirits sink
I've been unwelcome
I've been unloved
I've been cheated on and made a fool of

And then I look at the world
In all its glory
I look at the world
And it's a different story
Each time I look at the world
In all its glory
I look at the world
And it's a different story
Each time I look at the world
Each time I look at the world
Each time I look at the worldEmbed
