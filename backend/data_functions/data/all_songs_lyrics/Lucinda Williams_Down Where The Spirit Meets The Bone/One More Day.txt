One More Day LyricsGive me one more day
To turn things around
Give me one more day
To get my feet on the ground
To dig in my heels
And settle down
Give me one more day
To turn things around
Give me one more day
To come up with a plan
Give me one more day
To see if I can
Find my way
And come back again
Give me one more day
To come up with a plan
Give me one more day
To do the right thing
Give me one more day
To see what it will bring
To have one more day
I would give anything
Give me one more day
To do the right thing
Give me one more day
To try my luck
Give me one more day
To spend a couple bucks
And place my bet
And win back your love
Give me one more day
To try my luck
Give me one more day
To put up a fight
Give me one more day
To take back the night
To battle these demons
With all of my might
Give me one more day
To put up a fight
Give me one more day
To look in your eyes
Give me one more day
To make you realize
That I don't know what to say
When my soul cries
Give me one more day
To look in your eyes
Give me one more day
Just one more day
Give me one more dayEmbed
