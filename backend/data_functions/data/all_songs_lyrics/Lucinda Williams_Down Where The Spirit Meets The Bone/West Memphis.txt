West Memphis LyricsThree little boys were found on the river
On a sweltering summer night
Not one soul ever figured it out
Who created that terrible sight
Now somebody's gotten away with murder
And a horrible offense
Well that's the way we do things in West Memphis
They didn't like the music I listened to
They didn't like the way I dressed
They set me up with a forced confession
I never had a chance
They threw the book at me at my expense
They got no common sense
But that's the way they do things in West Memphis
That's the way we do things in West Memphis
That's the way we do things in West Memphis
It's never been any different
So don't come around here and try to mess with us
Cause that's the way we do things in West Memphis
I was framed and sentenced
To a life in prison
For a crime I didn't commit
Wasn't nobody listened or rose in my defense
Somebody planted the evidence and he's been lying ever since
But that's the way we do things in West Memphis
And after all these years they still refuse
To say what really happened
The crooked methods they used
To frame an innocent man
Are hiding in the darkest secrets behind every picket fence
And that's the way we do things in West Memphis
That's the way we do things in West Memphis
Yeah that's the way we do things in West Memphis
Is never been any different
So, don't come round here and try to mess with us
'Cause that's the way we do things in West Memphis
Yeah that's the way we do things in West Memphis
Yeah that's the way we do things in West Memphis
Is never been any different
So, don't come round here try to mess with us
'Cause that's the way we do things in West Memphis
That's just the way we do things in West Memphis
That's just the way we do things in West MemphisEmbed
