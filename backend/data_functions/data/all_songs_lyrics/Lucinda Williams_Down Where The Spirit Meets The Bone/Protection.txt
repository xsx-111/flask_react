Protection Lyrics
I've seen some things in life as God is my witness
A crowded bar where nobody could hear
Now I travel through the world with dedication
And what I do, I do it all by my own sweet self

I need protection from the enemy of love
I need protection from the enemy of righteousness
I need protection from the enemy of good
I need protection from the enemy of kindness
Give me protection from the enemy of love

I came into the world all alone
Pushing and struggling to find a home
I'll tell you what child, go ahead and repeat it
It was my own trial made me stand on my two feet
I need protection from the enemy of love
I need protection from the enemy of rock and roll
I need protection from the enemy of good
I need protection from the enemy of kindness
Give me protection from the enemy of soul

You know the people be grinnin' and talkin' about me
Make me throw up my hands and call out crying
But the worlds gonna spin with or without me
So I still get up and I keep on trying
Living in a world full of endless troubles
Living in a world with darkness doubles
But my burden is lifted when I stand up
And use the gift I was given for not giving up


I need protection
Give me protection
I need protection
Give me protection
Yeah I need protection
Give me protection
I need protection
Give me protectionEmbed
