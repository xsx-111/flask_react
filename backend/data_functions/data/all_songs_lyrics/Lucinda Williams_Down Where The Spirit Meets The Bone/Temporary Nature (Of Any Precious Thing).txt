Temporary Nature (Of Any Precious Thing) LyricsAfraid to love and afraid to give
Just because of what it might cost us
But love can never, never live
Without the pain, the pain of loss
Life's never fair and it can be rough
And it can turn and play cruel tricks on us
And just when we think we've had enough
There's always on more river to cross

The temporary nature of any precious thing
That just makes it, just makes it more precious
But not easier, not easier to lose
To lose somebody as precious as you
We don't have an answer, God only knows
Why we are made to weather these storms
But God knows I love you
And you've always been precious
Since the day, the day you were born
And it's always the sweetest reddest roses
That kiss the sharpest thorns
And it's always the deepest saddest joys
That prove to be the richest ones
The temporary nature of any precious thing
That just makes it, just makes it more precious
But not easier, not easier to lose
To lose somebody, somebody like you
To lose somebody as precious as you
To lose somebody as precious as youEmbed
