Everything but the Truth LyricsYou got the power to make this mean ole world a better place
You got the power to make this mean ole world a better place
People say they hate you, try to kill you, while they're grinning in your face
You got the power to make this mean ole world a better place
Before you can have a friend, you gotta be one
Before you can have a friend, you gotta be one
You gotta do the right things, gotta jump on in and see that it gets done
Before you can have a friend, you gotta be one

Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
He's not playing games; he's taking names; he is bullet proof
Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
God put the firewood there, but you gotta light yourself
God put the firewood there, but you gotta light yourself
You gotta go it alone, you gotta gather it up, ain't nobody gonna help
God put the firewood there, but you gotta light yourself
You gotta make the most of what equipment you've got
You gotta make the most of what equipment you've got
Don't sit around complaining, crying all the time, 'cause you don't have a lot
You gotta make the most of what equipment you've got
Sooner or later before too long, you gotta make a payment
Sooner or later before too long, you gotta make a payment
You've gotta settle up with this sweet ole world and give back what you've taken
Sooner or later before too long, you gotta make a payment

Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
He's not playing games; he's taking names; he is bullet proof
Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
Everything's gonna change, everything but the truth
Everything's gonna change, everything but the truthEmbed
