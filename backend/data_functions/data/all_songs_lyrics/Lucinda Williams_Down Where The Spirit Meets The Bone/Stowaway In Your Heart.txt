Stowaway In Your Heart LyricsThank you for giving me a place to keep my love
I don't need anything special, none of that stuff
I'm a stowaway in your heart and that's enough
Thank you for giving me a place to keep my love
Thank you for giving me a place to close my eyes
You don't have to promise heaven or paradise
I'm a stowaway in your heart and that's the prize
Thank you for giving me a place to close my eyes
Thank you for giving me a place to take my blue
Don't have to say Hail Mary's or halleluh
I'm a stowaway in your heart and that will do
Thank you for giving me a place to take my blue
Thank you for giving me a place to hang around
You don't have to be an angel or wear a crown
I'm a stowaway in your heart, I won't make a sound
Thank you for giving me a place to hang around
Thank you for giving me a place to keep my love
Thank you for giving me a place to close my eyes
Thank you for giving me a place to take my blue
Thank you for giving me a place to hang around
I'm a stowaway in your heart
I'm a stowaway in your heart
I'm a stowaway in your heart
I'm a stowaway in your heartEmbed
