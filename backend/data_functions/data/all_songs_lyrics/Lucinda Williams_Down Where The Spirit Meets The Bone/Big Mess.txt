Big Mess LyricsAs far as I can tell
You are history
You can go straight to hell
That's alright with me
You go on as usual
And you act like you it doesn't mean jack
How can you be so casual?
As you mess me up again

But I got a handle on things
Yeah I got my prescription
I change the channel
I stop my subscription
I got a handle on things
I got my prescription
I change the channel
I stop my subscription
I know your smile it's just an evil grin
You've been lyin' all the while
Truth is just sinking in
You left a big mess behind
That I'm gonna have to clean up
You think you can change my mind
But you're clean out of luck
But I got a handle on things
I got my prescription
I change the channel
I stop my subscription
I got a handle on things
I got my prescription
I change the channel
I stop my subscription
You act so ambivalent
And you got no explanation
You suppose to represent
I don't know what you were thinking
You trip and you pray
Every golden rule
You slip when you pay
You try to play me for a fool

But I got a handle on things
I got my prescription
I change the channel
I stop my subscription
I got a handle on things
I got my prescription
I change the channel
I stop my subscriptionEmbed
