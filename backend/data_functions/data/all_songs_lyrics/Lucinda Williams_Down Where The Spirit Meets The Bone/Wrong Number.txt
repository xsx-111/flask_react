Wrong Number LyricsWrong number, nobody here by that name
Wrong number, nobody here by that name
I ain't heard a word since I don't know when
So don't even bother to dial it again
Wrong number
Wrong number
Wrong apartment, nobody here by that name
Wrong apartment, nobody here by that name
I can't tell you where he went
And here's the thing
He was late on the rent
And the lock's been changed
Wrong apartment
Wrong apartment
Wrong motel, nobody here by that name
Wrong motel, nobody here by that name
I can't tell you how come
He never checked in
But I reckon it's 'cause
He's in trouble again
Wrong motel
Wrong motel
Wrong address, nobody here by that name
Wrong address, nobody here by that name
Now honey your guess is as good as mine
One neighbor confessed they were fightin' all the time
Wrong address
Wrong address
Wrong town, nobody here by that name
Wrong town, nobody here by that name
If you see him around tell me
'Cuz I'm his next of kin
He might be Vicksburg bound
That's what neighbors say
Wrong town
Wrong town
Wrong number
Wrong apartment
Wrong hotel
Wrong address
Wrong town
Wrong town
Wrong town
Wrong town
Wrong townEmbed
