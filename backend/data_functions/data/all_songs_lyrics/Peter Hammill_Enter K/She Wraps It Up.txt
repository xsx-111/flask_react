She Wraps It Up LyricsYou know that she's got something she wants to give;
Hard to tell if it's of spirit or the life she lives...
Maybe somewhere between the two
Oh, the waiting to see what it is!
The energy donor, looking over her shoulder
She sees it all, she sees it slipping away
There's a backbone shiver for the energy giver...
She wraps it up, and that's a final wrap for today
Some things she'll soon learn to live without
While others she's not secure enough to doubt
It'll be hard to stay so close
When all that special emptiness floods out
The energy donor shoots it straight from the shoulder:
She sees it all, she sees it all rushing through
There's a backbone shiver from the energy giver...
She wraps it up, she wraps it up and gives it to you
Jumping shells, the electrons will dance
Like dusk-time fireflies
Just as well that you took that last chance
To extend all your by-and-bys
Let's be clear:
Don't be too far away...
Oh, but don't get so near!
You'll remember today for the rest of your life
The energy donor, looking over her shoulder
She sees it all, she sees it slipping away
There's a backbone shiver for the energy giver;
She wraps it up, and that's a heavy rap you'll have to pay
The energy donor shoots it straight from the shoulder:
She sees it all, she sees it all rushing through
There's a backbone shiver from the energy giver â€“
She wraps it up, she wraps it up and gives it to youEmbed
