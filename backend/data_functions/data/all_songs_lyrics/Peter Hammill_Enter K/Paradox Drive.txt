Paradox Drive LyricsThe thought crossed my mind –
How curious, why should I want so much shut-eye?
Fighting the darkness and furious
Oh, but I once more fall into the song...
Just the normal unconsciousness;
Could that be wrong?
All out into action then all down into sleep –
Check that attraction, it must be more than skin deep
I've checked the twenty-four hours
I've done the stay-up-all-night;
In a certain way that's power
But it's not wired up right
Up for the pleasure, then it's dead to the world;
Our lives surely measured by the unconscious third...
Living on Paradox Drive
We must be living on Paradox Drive
We must be living on Paradox Drive
We must be living on, living on, living on Paradox Drive
The thought crossed my mind, how curious –
Why should I want so much shut-eye?
Fighting the darkness and furious...
Oh, but I once more dropped off to the deep
The sweet comfort of a life on my own, asleep
Up for the pleasure or dead to the world
A life surely measured by the unconscious third...
Living on Paradox Drive
We must be living on Paradox Drive
We must be living on Paradox Drive
We must be living on Paradox Drive
We must be living on Paradox Drive
We must be living on, living on, living on Paradox Drive
I've checked the twenty-four hours
I've done the stay-up-all-night;
In a certain way that's power
But it's not wired up right
It still isn't right
It still isn't right
It still isn't right
It still isn't rightEmbed
