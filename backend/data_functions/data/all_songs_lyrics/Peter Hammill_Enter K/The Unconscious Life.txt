The Unconscious Life LyricsI'm in command
I'm in control
I am the captain of my soul
Still, I'm uncertain in one major role...
Oh, I drift through the unconscious life
Shift through the unconscious life
Lift up my unconscious eyes:
Beyond all normal pain and pleasure
We should treasure the unconscious life
We've got our reasons for most things we do
We could surely rationalise them through
A false ring of confidence
Would characterise us true â€“
Oh, we're deep in the unconscious life
Asleep in the unconscious life
Peeping through unconscious eyes
Beyond all normal pain and pleasure
We should treasure
Treasure the unconscious
Treasure the unconscious life
Something makes me nervous
Something makes me twitch
Something makes me scratch that Pavlovian itch
(Wonder what that is now...?)
Someone that I barely know must unpick the stitch
To unravel the unconscious life
Travel the unconscious life
Gather the unconscious eye...
Far from shedding light on any motive
The candle is votive when it burns at both ends
I'm not in command
I'm out of control
I am the Ship's Boy of my soul...
Oh, we drift through the unconscious life
Shift through the unconscious life
Live through the unconscious lifeEmbed
