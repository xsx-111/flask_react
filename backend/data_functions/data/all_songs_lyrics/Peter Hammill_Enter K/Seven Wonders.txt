Seven Wonders LyricsWell, it must have been here somewhere
That which the culture highly prized:
The list of ancient buildings
The attitude of mind
The wisdom of the prophets
The catalogue of books...
You can't get off it
You don't know where to look
You don't know where to look
I know you don't know what to say
And it's strange now, see how
Everything's changed
Including the Seven Wonders
Nothing is permanent here
New kick, new game, new theory
The rest reduced to nought:
It only takes a moment
One clear and lucid thought
Once the process has been triggered
All previous process disappears...
I don't know what it is you fear
I don't know what it is you fear â€“
The shift is nothing to be afraid of
Strange now, see how
Everything's changed
Including the Seven Wonders
Nothing is permanent here
That's part of the spell we're under
Getting old then, say when
You're happy to hold
Your personal Seven Wonders
Nothing is permanent hereEmbed
