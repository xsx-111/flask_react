Accidents LyricsThis meeting is a coincidence
Which deserves a second look:
We've seen the chapter of accidents
Become the longest in the book
I see your face in the picture for better or worse
All power to the accident!
Oh, the sweetest is the one I'm holding in my arms
And the fleetest is the one who survives
But the meetest is the one who's running on the spot
Where the accident's about to arrive
I know my place on the planet, chapter and verse
All part of the accident
I know my place in the story, a line of blank verse
A part of the accident
No system worth its salt
Lays all its cards upon the table;
No discipline of thought
Will render me more able
To buck those random throws
This meeting is a coincidence
Which deserves a second look â€“
We've seen the chapter of accidents
It's the longest in the book
Oh, the sweetest is the one I'm holding in my arms
And the fleetest is the one who survives
But the meetest is the one who's running on the spot
Where the accident's about to arrive...
(The accidental, the accident!)
Your face in the picture for better or worse
All power to the accident!
I know my place on the planet, chapter and verse
All part of the accident
I know my place in the story, a line of blank verse
A part of the accident
I see your face in the picture for better or worse
All power to the accident
All power to the accident!Embed
