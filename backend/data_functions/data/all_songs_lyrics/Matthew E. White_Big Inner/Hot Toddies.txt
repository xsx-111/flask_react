Hot Toddies LyricsWhen a cold wind hits you in the face
Frost on your windows like fine white lace
The void is cold, my friend
But the fire is warm and bright
The fire is warm and bright, baby
The fire is warm and bright
Hot toddies
Lord, we'll have a good time
Hot toddies
Lord, we'll have the best time
When the snow makes it look all the same
Soft and drifting on the glittering plain
The void is cold my friend, but the fire is warm and bright
The fire is warm and bright
The fire is warm and bright
Hot toddies, Lord, we'll have a good time
Hot toddies, Lord, we'll have the best time
The Lord made lemons and the Lord made me
But the Devil and his demons gave us sweet whiskey
Sweet whiskey
Hot toddies
Lord, we'll have a good time
Hot toddies
Lord, we'll have the best time
Who likes winter?
We like winterEmbed
