Will You Love Me LyricsBaby, will you love me?
Child, will you hold me?
Will you lay beside me
At least most of the night?
Baby, you're magnificent
Child, you're intelligent
Honey, you could pay the rent
With that smile on your face
But this loneliness, it won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
Baby, you left and you didn't say why
Mostly darkness in my mind
Sometimes it leaves me, sometimes it leaves me behind
And maybe I can see you soon
Tell you all the things that I meant to
See you shinin' like the golden sun
Puttin' everyone to shame
I'll put my arms around you all night long, baby
I'll kiss you head to toe, I'll sing you a song, baby
I'll rock with you from side to side
I'll rock with you until the day we die
But this loneliness, it won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
Baby, you left and you didn't say why
Mostly darkness in my mind
Sometimes it leaves me, sometimes it leaves me behind
Darkness can't drive out darkness
Only love can do that, baby
Only love can do that
And this loneliness, it won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
Baby, you left and you didn't say why
Mostly darkness in my mind
Sometimes it leaves me, sometimes it leaves me behind
And baby, when things ain't right
You need someone to stay the night
I'll be there till the morning light
And longer if you needEmbed
