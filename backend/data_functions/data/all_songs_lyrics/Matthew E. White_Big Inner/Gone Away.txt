Gone Away LyricsStreets of gold, in Jesus' robes
Where peace resounds like a river, they say
Why are you living in Heaven today?
Your body's cold
Your body's so cold
But your sins and your sorrows are all done away
Why are you living there now, baby?
Why are you living there now?
Gone away, child
Taken away
Why are you living in Heaven today?
Why are you living there now?
Stolen away, baby
Given away
Why are you living in Heaven today?
Why are you living there now?
We cling to the cross with trembling and fear
And all of our hearts are burdened with care
The family is broken and pouring out tears
We'll miss you, baby
We miss you, dear
Gone away
And baby, given away
Why are you living in Heaven today?
Why are you living there now?
Stolen away
Baby, taken away
Why are you living in Heaven today?
Why are you living there now?
He will break your kingdom down
He will tear your kingdom downEmbed
