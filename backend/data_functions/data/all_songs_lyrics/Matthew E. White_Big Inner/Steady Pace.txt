Steady Pace LyricsDid you ever wonder where the night spends all its days?
Relaxing in the shadows, baby, or stretched out in the haze?
Or does it travel to the void of outer space?
Not trying to make a fuss
Lord, we can take our time
Not trying to make you rush
Lord, we can take our time
Such a world to be walking in
And I'll be making up my own lines
As long as we are moving at a steady pace, baby
We can take our time
(We’re rolling)
As long as we are moving at a steady pace, child
We can take our time
(We’re rolling)
Did you ever wonder where the morning spends the night?
Sitting on the moon or curled up in a street light?
Or is it hanging out in the sparkle of your eye?
Not trying to make a fuss
Lord, we can take our time
Not trying to make you rush
Lord, we can take our time
In the heat of the evening or in the cool of the day
Whatever thoughts that cross your lips will be just fine
As long as we are moving at a steady pace, baby
We can take our time
(We’re rolling)
As long as we are moving at a steady pace, child
We can take our time
(We’re rolling)Embed
