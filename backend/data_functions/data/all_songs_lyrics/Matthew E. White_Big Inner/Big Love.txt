Big Love LyricsLet’s begin to spiral
Let’s begin to spiral
Oh, you don’t want to spiral with me
Because I think that I can trust you
About as far as I can throw you
And I’m moving on
I’m moving on
Moving on like any other man should
Moving on like any other man would
Big love, big love, big love
I’ve got to carry on
Time to mess around
Time to mess around
Oh, you don’t want to mess around with me
Because I think that I can trust you
About as far as I can throw you
And I’m moving on
I’m moving on
Moving on like any other man should
Moving on like any other man would
Big love, big love, big love
I’ve got to carry on
Why don’t you drop that shit?
I am the same old shit
Live free
Girl, I am a barracuda
I am a hurricane
Live free
I am a barracuda
I am a hurricane
Live free
Girl, why don’t you drop that shit?
I am the same old shit, baby
I am the same old shit
Live free
Big love, big love, big love
I’ve got to carry onEmbed
