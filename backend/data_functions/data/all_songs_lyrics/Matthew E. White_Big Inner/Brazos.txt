Brazos LyricsWade across the Brazos
Walk the water like Jesus
They're gonna come from all directions tonight
And baby, we ain't got no home
Here today and tomorrow we're gone
But you look beautiful by the fireside
Child, we ain't from this world
The whole thing, it cause my heart to moan
Babe, we are strangers in this land
They say that white folks are never lazy, baby
They say that white folks are never lazy, child
They say that white folks are never lazy
Then baby, what are we doing here?
Oh child, what are we doing here?
Take it easy, baby
Take it easy, baby
Take it easy, baby, tonight
My heart's sinking like apostle Peter
Lord, sunk like a stone because he wasn't a believer
And I'm not sure, babe, that I am either
Child, I'm just not sure
They say
In the kingdom there's no sun to burn, baby
In the kingdom there's no cracker to hurt you, child
In the kingdom there'll be no slavery
Baby, do you think that's true?
Oh child, do you think that's true?
Take it easy, baby
Take it easy, baby
Take it easy, baby, tonight
Wade across the Brazos
Walk the water like Jesus
We're gonna need the Lord's help tonight
My body is a-bending low
Underneath life's crushing blow
Golden hours come swiftly on the wing
Stand beside me, baby, won't you hear the angels sing?
Child, won't you hear the angels sing?
Stand beside me, baby, won't you hear the angels sing?
Child, won't you hear the angels sing?
Baby, won't you hear the angels sing?
Jesus Christ is our Lord
Jesus Christ, he is your friendEmbed
