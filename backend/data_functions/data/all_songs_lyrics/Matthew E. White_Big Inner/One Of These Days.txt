One Of These Days LyricsI know you can't help that your smile's the brightest
It's hard to look away, baby
It's hard to look away
Your eyes make peace like a river
And your eyes make love like an ocean
I can never look away
Oh baby, I can never look away
You give me joy like a fountain deep down in my soul
You give me joy like a fountain deep down in my soul
One of these days, one of these days, one of these days
You don't think that you'll ever die, looking like you do
We all pass away
Everyone finds a way
And I don't want to live a minute longer than you
So let's meet the Lord together
Like everything else we do
Oh child, like everything else we do
You give me joy like a fountain deep down in my soul
You give me joy like a fountain deep down in my soul
And I want to lay next to you when our glory fades
And I want to lay next to you, I'll never turn away
And I want to tell you you're the sweetest thing that the Lord has ever made
One of these days, one of these days, one of these days
They say youth is a vision that we can't see till we're old
But you're the sweetest revelation that these weary eyes will ever hold
Will ever hold
And I want to lay next to you when our glory fades
And I want to lay next to you, I'll never turn away
And I want to tell you you're the sweetest thing that the Lord has ever made
One of these days, one of these days, one of these days
Reap and sow the things you won't let go
Four o'clock flowers bloom in the morning
They fold in the afternoon
Yeah, they fold in the afternoon
Why aren't you still standing on the sidewalk by my stairs?
Seems like everyone's movin' away
Oh child, seems like everyone's movin' away
There's so much beauty and it fades so soon
There's so much beauty and it fades so soon
I want to lay next to you when our glory fades
I want to lay next to you, I'll never turn away
I want to tell you you're the sweetest thing that the Lord has ever made
One of these days, one of these days, one of these days
One of these days, one of these days, one of these daysEmbed
