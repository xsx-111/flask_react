I Know You LyricsWhen it could be said
That I'm not in time with what's in front of me
Well who should I turn to
When there's so many things we should go through
Back when we first met
There was a storm off Chebucto Head
And some people I didn't like
And there's someone here that you and I recognize
She's not you
It's not me
It's just a bit of everybody else
And all the others they surround
It won't do
It can't be
When is it time for winter's white to melt
For all the people in this town
If I never considered
A little drop in the pressure that defines me as human
I try not to let it go
You never tell by the pick of the litter
It keeps coming back in the tides and swells
And there's nothing to hold it at bay
I figured you knew that
And who stood up, was there anybody out there
I never thought to ask
It made the time pass
Knowing that I didn't care
I'm wishing for some other chances
There wasn't time to review all the circumstances
Of all the particular sounds
Converging around us
And then the sky's gone out
Was on a record player in the middle of the city
On a song that I never enjoyed
Until I got older
So you carried it up to the finish
And that version of yourself began to diminish
And nobody saw it go down
And I thought I knew you
She isn't you
It wasn't me
It was a bit of everybody else
And all the others they surround
It won't do
It can't be
When is it time for winter's white to melt
For all the people in this town
Never, not again
Will I commit to looking carefully back
At places I didn't go
When there's so many people I'll never knowEmbed
