Fading Into Obscurity LyricsSo many stories I could tell
I had the world under my spell
Does this even ring a bell?
I wonder because
Don't you know who I was?
Interest in me dissipated
All my methods antiquated
I've been cast away
Lost and friendless today
I made a name for myself
When one could do such a thing
A reputation that's held
Together by string
And so I chose to cherish those
Who think there's some purity
To fading into obscurity
What works on paper
Has the tendency to ride on vapor
Sometimes what's not to love
But then other times what's to like
I'm unable to tell if I know who I am
A modest success a shill or a sham
I'm not a afraid of what I've made
But my trajectory
Has me fading into obscurity
You kids'll have to fend for yourselves
Because your mother's gone, and as for the elves
Who used to do all the work around here
Well they're not gonna do it anymore
You kids can kiss your mother goodbye
And I'll give you twenty minutes to cry
She used to do all the work around here
But she's not gonna do it anymore
And you're getting to old to be cared for by me
And for that matter
This cake is baked but I much prefer the batter
Perhaps in part because it had so much potential
To be delicious and still be influential
I'm undecided
If the evidence that I have provided
Explains what I mean
It's too late now cause I can't see or be seen
And I know you don't shrug through my tears
So I'm not gonna shed 'em anymore
Out of favor with the flavor of the week's where I'll be
And fading into obscurity
An outsider but in good company
Oh yeah
I'm fading into obscurity
I'm undecidedEmbed
