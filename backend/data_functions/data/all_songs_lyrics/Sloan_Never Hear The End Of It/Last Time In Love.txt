Last Time In Love LyricsThis is my last time
Last time in love
And I got suddenly scared
That I'll never get to fall in love
Again
All my life
I opened myself up to
Anyone
I tried for awhile and always let 'em down
Moving on
Was something I mastered
Is it
Fair to say I got so good at it
That I went to town
Then I met you (ooh)
Falling for you wasn't hard to do
But déjà vu (ooh)
Always falling but this feeling's new
Is this my last time
Last time in love
Oh, it's time I asked myself why
I'm not learning my lesson
If it's my last time
Last time in love
Then it's bittersweet because I
Know I'll never get to fall in love
Again
Hanging in has been hard up till now
Because I
Tried to be someone else
But it wasn't doing any good
Everyone
I ever went out with thought I
Had to change
Anyone who knows me knows I never could
Now I'm with you (ooh)
Sticking with it can be hard to do
But I can say (hey)
I wouldn't have it any other way
Now it's my last time
Last time in love
Oh, it's not that I never cared
For the others way back when
But it's my last time
Last time in love
Oh, and I got suddenly scared
That I'll never get to fall in love again
Yes, it's my last time
Last time in love
I wonder who'd have believed
Of the ones who knew me well
That it's my last time
Last time in love
Oh, but part of me is relieved
That I'll never have to fall in love
