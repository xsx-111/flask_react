Right Or Wrong LyricsTen years ahead of our time
Or about one year behind
Sometimes it tends to get to me
But don't dare bite the hand that leads
To the light
Of renown
It's a battle that won't make any sound
Either you're with us
Or you're not
Sometimes lately I just wanna be caught
Right or wrong
We're breaking their hearts again
Wonder what you're waiting for
Right or wrong
We're breaking their hearts again now
Yeah now
Yeah now
This one's for the girls
There's no particular one in the world
'Til I got a glimpse of what could be
I was shocked by what I couldn't forsee
And in spite
Of the times
I never really wanna come round
You're always with me
When you're not
Lights are up, we're all gonna be caught
Right or wrong
You're breaking our hearts again
Wonder what you're waiting for
Right or wrong
You're breaking our hearts again now
Yeah now
Yeah now
Mysterious missives, not unlike a dream
Sooner or later we'll be singing for free
Right or wrong
We're breaking their hearts again now
Yeah now
Yeah now
Right or wrong
We're breaking their hearts again
Wonder what you're waiting for
Right or wrong
We're breaking their hearts again now
Yeah now
Yeah now
Right or wrong
Right or wrong
Right or wrongEmbed
