Light Years LyricsI think she said
"It's like a kiss from God"
Then she laughed
Still I found it odd
That I'm only realizing just how
She is light years away from me now
"Have you seen
The stars above from the roof?"
She repeated
While I acted aloof
'Cause the only thing on my mind
Was the light years between our own kind
Still I like to come when you call
Addiction is sweet
Will I savor the fall?
But if you hit the bottom floor
Will I still hear a knock at my door?
Oh yeah
Still I like to come when you call
Addiction is sweet
That much I recall
But if you hit the bottom floor
You'll see the light above my door
I don't hear
From you so much anymore
And I wonder
If you're still gonna score
With the stars that are shooting tonight
I keep track of them upon this flight
And I hope you don't split the seam
And make the light years seem like a dream
Oh yeahEmbed
