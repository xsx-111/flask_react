Living With The Masses LyricsLiving with the masses
Will always get you down
And next to me they're teaching classes
On how to really bring me down
I never asked for a neighbour like you
To run around and around like a wrecking ball
Is there some renovating you should do
Maybe you should cut in the dark with your table saw
Always going faster
Than the others down the road
You should bring out the sandblaster, whoa-oh
So I can really hear your workload
I never asked for a neighbour like you
To run around and around like a wrecking ball
There's so many other people just like you
You're like the sights and the sounds of a nuclear war
The bomb-bay doors are opening
(Bomb-bay doors)
And soon they will be falling all around
The bomb-bay doors are opening
(Bomb-bay doors)
And soon they will be falling all aroundEmbed
