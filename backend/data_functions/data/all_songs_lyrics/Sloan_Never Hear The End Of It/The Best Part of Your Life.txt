The Best Part of Your Life Lyrics
You take the best part of your life
And you figure out what went right
And then you bottle it up inside
And hide it from the light
You take the best part of your life
And you figure out what went right
And then you bottle it up inside
To hide it from their eyes

Yeah, the best part of your life
Yeah, you keep it inside (inside)

You yearn to give it away for free
To the deserving and the weak
But it's a secret that you keep
That no one else can see
You'd like to give it away for free
To the deserving and the weak (but it's over)
But it's a secret that you keep (over)
Hidden quietly

Yeah, give it away for free
Yeah, for all to see (to see)
Once you let it get too far
You lose all sense of who you are
Trying to get back how that felt
Getting lost inside yourself (oh)
Getting lost inside yourself (but it's over, over)
(Oh, it has to go
Oh, it's over, yeah)

You take the best part of your life
And you figure out what went right
And then you bottle it up inside
And hide it from the light

Yeah, give it away for free
Yeah, for all to see (to see)

Once you let it get too far
You lose all sense of who you are
Trying to get back how that felt
Getting lost inside yourself
Getting lost inside yourself
You take the best part of your life
Getting lost inside yourself
Getting lost inside yourself
You take the best part of your lifeEmbed
