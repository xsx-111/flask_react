Another Way I Could Do It LyricsI don't know my way through this city
And I know I never will
There's people living their whole lives here
And having problems still
Fingers pointing — I'll take the bullet
Anybody mind if we share
No, their names are not important
That's half the problem there
Is it another failure to mention
Or just there wasn't much to tell
We tried to define intervention
To try to break the spell
I asked the man with all the answers
Give me some good news but don't lie
He said, I'd like to but I can't sir
You know why
If there's another way I could do it
If there's another way I could do it
If there's another way to do it
You think I'd know by now
There's another way to blow it all
There's another way to blow it
Yeah, yeah — better yet
Blow it
You know I've been there
Yeah — better yet
Hey, la la la la
Hey, la la la la
Hey, la la la la la la
Hey, la la la la
Hey, la la la la
Hey, la la la la la laEmbed
