HFXNSHC LyricsWell I remember years ago
When our punk rock was none of their business
Now that we have all grown older
Our punk rock's still none of their business
New beat generation
New beat generation
If you're one of the few who got to lose yourself
Cause they kept pushing you
You're the one it's about
Without a doubt
You wear it out in everything you do
New beat generation
New beat generation
Well I remember years ago
When our punk rock was none of their business
Now that you left me I can still see
That it's none of their business
New beat generation
New beat generation
New beat generation
(Shit)
New beat generation
New beat, new beat generation
A punch in the face of salvation
New beat, new beat generation
