Everybody Wants You LyricsEverybody wants you
Everybody dies
Whenever they're around you
So it comes as no surprise
That I feel the way I do today
But I haven't got the heart to say
God, it feels so wrong
I hope nobody hears about it
God, it feels so strong
I hope nobody hears, hope nobody hears
Everbody wants to
Think they're understood
Or maybe understanding
Or at least I think they should
You know it wasn't supposed to be this way
I've guess I got a lot of nerve to say
God, it feels so wrong
I hope nobody hears about it
God, it feels so strong
I hope nobody hears about it
God, it feels so wrong
I hope nobody hears about it
God, it feels so strong
I hope nobody hears, hope nobody hears
God, it feels so wrong
I hope nobody hears about it
Hope nobody hears about it
Oh no
Everybody wants you
Everybody wants you
Everybody wants you
Everybody wants youEmbed
