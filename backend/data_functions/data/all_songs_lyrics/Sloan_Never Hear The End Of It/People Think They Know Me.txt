People Think They Know Me LyricsPeople think they know me but they don't
People say they know me but they don't
People say they love me but they don't
People think they know me but they don't
They're a little bit warm
They know a bit about some things
They know shit about some things
People think they know me but they don't
People say they know me but they don't
People think they own me but they don't
People think they know me but they don't
Don't make this personal
Like you don't know
Let's roll reverse it all
I'd like to know
If I'm a little bit warm
I know a bit about some things
I know shit about anything
People think they know me but they don't
People say they love me but they don't
People think they know me but they don'tEmbed
