Ill Placed Trust LyricsEverything you do I want to do too
Every where you go I follow you
When I'm on my own, I wonder where you are
People tell me that I take it too far
Ill placed trust, promises rust
Ill placed trust, ill placed trust
Ill placed trust, buried in dust
Ill placed trust, ill placed trust, yeah
Can you feel it
All around you
Paranoia
That surrounds you
Ill placed trust, promises rust
Ill placed trust, ill placed trust
Ill placed trust, buried in dust
Ill placed trust, ill placed trust, yeah
When I close my eyes, you're all that I see
Burned into my mind, walking away from me
Can you feel it, all around you
The paranoia that's been brought on by the sad truth
Ill placed trust, promises rust
Ill placed trust, ill placed trust
Ill placed trust, buried in dust
Ill placed trust, ill placed trust, yeah
Can you feel it
I can feel it
(Ill placed trust)
Can you feel it
(Ill placed trust)
(Ill placed trust)
I can feel it
(Ill placed trust)
(Ill placed trust)
Can you feel it
(Ill placed trust)
(Ill placed trust)
I can feel it
(Ill placed trust)
(Ill placed trust)
Can you feel it
(Ill placed trust)
(Ill placed trust)
I can feel it
(Ill placed trust)
(Ill placed trust)
Can you feel it
(Ill placed trust)
(Ill placed trust)
I can feel it
(Ill placed trust)
(Ill placed trust)
Can you feel it
(Ill placed trust)
