Will I Belong? LyricsI fell in with your crowd
I didn't belong
I didn't belong
You weren't exactly wowed
I didn't belong
I didn't belong
(Ah-ah-ah)
I wondered what I did to offend
It wasn't one thing, it was more of a blend
I've learned the cruelest rules never bend
Meanwhile back in school
I didn't belong
I didn't belong
My name defined uncool
I didn't belong
I didn't belong
Just how this happened is up for debate
Some say I learned it, some say it's innate
But it's out the window when we graduate
My reputation
Gets another chance
Will I belong
Will I belong
(Ah-ah-ah)Embed
