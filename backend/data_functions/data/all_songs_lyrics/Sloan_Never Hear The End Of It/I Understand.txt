I Understand LyricsFalling from the sky
Youâ€™re free finally
You took me by surprise
Crashing down in front of me
But it's all right
You open up your eyes
To show how they see
You open up your heart
To show how it beats
You open up your hands
To show how they can bleed
It's alright, it's okay
'Cause everything will work out fine today
Because I understand
Spinning me around
I feel just how light
Jumping up and down
I feel just how high
Turning up the sound
(Turning up the sound) Loud
It's okay (it's okay), it's alright (it's alright)
'Cause everything will work out fine tonight
Because I understand
I understand
You
I understand
I understand you
I understand
I understand you
Time to waste I've burned through all I need
Spend some time hanging around with me
We don't even have to feel the same way
'Cause everything will work out fine today
I understand
I understand
I understand
I understand
I understand
I understand
I understand
I understand
I understand
I understand
I understand
I understandEmbed
