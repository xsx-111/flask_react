Set In Motion LyricsThey're coming out
With the movie version of my life
Based on the novel
That shouldn't have been written either
I called them up
And asked to meet the director
To see who would play me
And he said "We talked about actors but thought instead
That playing yourself might lend some cred"
All this time
I'm trying to halt the production
Apparently one day, long ago
I gave them all my permission
If that's the case
Let's hammer out some details
Remember I already told them once
I don't do nude scenes or my own stunts
This feature's a failure on all fronts
Just accept that these things are going to happen
Everything is set in motion
It will happen anywhere
And on and on we argued after all that
The thing was bad
To try and drum up popular demand
Asked the director, "Where do I stand?"
Just accept that these things are going to happen
Everything is set in motion
It will happen anyway
Just accept that these things are going to happen
Everything is set in motion
It will happen anyway
Just accept that these things are going to happen
Everything is set in motionEmbed
