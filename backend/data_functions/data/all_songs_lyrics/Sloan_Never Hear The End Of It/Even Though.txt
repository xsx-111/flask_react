Even Though Lyrics
Somewhere deep inside
I could see you there
And even though you lied
I don't really care

And day turns to night
It's never enough, a-no, no
How many times?
It's never enough, a-no, no
Promising you'll try
Well, it's just enough to let you get by

But you kept askin' why
And it's not really fair
But all that you deny
Is more than you can bear

Fade into light
It's never enough, a-no, no
Look into your eyes
It's never enough, a-no, no
You say you're alright
And that's just enough to let you get by

And day turns to night
It's never enough, a-no, no
How many times?
It's never enough, a-no, no
Look into your eyes
It's never enough, a-no, no
Promise that you'll try

Even though you lied
Even though you liedEmbed
