Before The End Of The Race LyricsStarted out one way, but turned out the other
And boy it's confused, I run into your brother
I just pay no mind, not trying to be kind
There's a mark on my heart, couldn't say that I love ya
Couldn't say that I love ya
It started out slowly then burned out and smothered
I know you don't know that I wanted to love her
I took the advice, afforded the price
And I woke up amused in the arms of another
You know my only regret
Is that we never really met before
Cause you're lost in the race
This didn't turn out now the way I'd imagined
They say runner's up never enjoy the pageant
And all of those lines, I've had to decline
Just like your friends, they're divided and rationed
You know my only request
Is that we really should be together more
Before the end of the ra-ce
Ooh, before the end of the race
Yeah, before the end of the ra-ce
Ooh, before the end of the race
Yeah, before the end of the ra-ce
Ooh, before the end of the race
Let's make it like we never met before
The end of the ra-ceEmbed
