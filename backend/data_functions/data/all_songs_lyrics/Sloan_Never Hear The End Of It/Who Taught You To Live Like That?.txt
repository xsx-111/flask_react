Who Taught You To Live Like That? LyricsShe came through inspections
Towards me in sections
The life disappeared from the room
She asked me politely
May I put this lightly
The death that you thought was exhumed
It's buried beneath us
Since I wrote the thesis
I think I know better than you
Who taught you to live like that?
Who taught you to live like that?
Who taught you to live like that?
Who taught you to live like that?
It's buried beneath us
Since I wrote the thesis
Who taught you to live like that?
You circulate freely
Surrender completely
Wind up alone in the road
The light's gettin' brighter
The prize to the fighter
And now we got somethin' to hold
And if it gets heavy
You can't keep it steady
Remember the things you been told
Who taught you to live like that?
Who taught you to live like that?
Who taught you to live like that?
Who taught you to live like that?
It's buried beneath us
Since I wrote the thesis
Who taught you to live like that?
Ahahah ah ah
Ahahah ah ah
Ahahah ah ah
Ahahah ah ah
Who taught you to live like that?
Sounds a bit offside
Judgin' who just died
Who'll be the first to speak
The piano was upright
Attendance was uptight
Countin' the days of the week
But 'round about midnight
Your comments were highlight
The party spilled into the street
Who taught you to live like that?
Who taught you to live like that?
Who taught you to live like that?
Who taught you to live like that?
But 'round about midnight
Your comments were highlight
Who taught you to live like that?Embed
