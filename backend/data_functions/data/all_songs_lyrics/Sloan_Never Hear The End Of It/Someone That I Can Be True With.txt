Someone That I Can Be True With LyricsOh where should I start?
She's sensitive and smart
That's not my favourite part and
Oh you won't forget
The beautiful brunette
With eyes of chocolate
And I don't know what you're used to
But I can't go back I refuse to
Oh and she loves me now
She's trying to show me how
But my mind is never open
I hope it works out well
Some days it can be hell
But it's a hell I have a hope in
And I don't know what that has to do with
She's someone to hear Husker Du with
And someone to wait in the queues with
And someone to hate all things new with
She's someone to watch Gremlins 2 with
And someone to not watch The View with
And someone to laugh in the pew with
And someone I can be true withEmbed
