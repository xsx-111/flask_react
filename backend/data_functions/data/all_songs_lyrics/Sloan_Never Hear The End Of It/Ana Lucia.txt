Ana Lucia Lyrics(I'm hanging out)
(I'm hanging out)
Ana Lucia
You're the belle of the ball
You really don't know me that much and
I really don't know you at all
You know how to hurt a guy
When I'm around you start to cry
I would go
If you say so
But I'm hanging out
(I'm hanging out)
(I'm hanging out)
I have tried to pick you up
(I'm hanging out)
But they always seem to interrupt
(I'm hanging out)
It's like they know
That the answer's no
But I'm hanging out
(I'm hanging out)
(I'm hanging out)
Ana Lucia
Please don't send me away
I really am trying my hardest
And you've so little to say
I have even tried in vain
(I'm hanging out)
To let you know
I've been to the south of Spain
(I'm hanging out)
I should think that you would recognize
You should pick on someone your own size
Ana Lucia
You're the belle of the ball
(I'm hanging out)
You really don't know me that much and
I really don't know
You at all
(I'm hanging out)
(I'm hanging out)
(I'm hanging out)
(I'm hanging out)
Oh, oh
(Hanging out)
Oh, oh
(Hanging out)
Oh, oh
(Hanging out)
Oh, oh
(I'm hanging out)Embed
