Blackout LyricsPeople walk around in a daze that's unsettled
And they're thinking of drinking until the morning
Never doing nothing about the trouble on the way
When the lights go out with out warning
Out back is the place where I watch it unravel
And the chalkboard got it's own ladybug
Upkeep is low and the wall are un-level
And no one has a clue what they're doing
There's a blackout for me and one for you too
There's some white heat keeping everybody down
When the grid snaps on
You'll be picking up the pieces of the blackout
There's nothing you can do about it
I can feel that the heat is killing everything around
And I hope that it soon gets colder
The lights are just a flicker and power is underground
And the city is about to smolder
Ther's a blackout for me and one for you too
There's some white heat keeping everybody down
When the grid snaps on
You'll be picking up the pieces of the blackout
There's nothin' you can do about it
There's nothin' you can do about it
Nothin' you can do about it
There's nothing you can doEmbed
