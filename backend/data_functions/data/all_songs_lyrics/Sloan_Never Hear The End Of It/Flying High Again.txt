Flying High Again LyricsWe can make it like we never met
Keep in mind that you'll never hear the end of it
It went okay, so far, so good I guess
At least until all the people get out of it
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Said so long we'll be sad to hear
Right or wrong, you know we'll never disappear
We're flying high against all denial
And some people think we're crazy
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high againEmbed
