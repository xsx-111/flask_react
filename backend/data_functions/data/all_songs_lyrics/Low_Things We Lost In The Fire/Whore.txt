Whore LyricsYou will get your...
Reward
What is that, whore
You're living for?
Is it so wrong
To think there's more?
There's always one
Worth waiting for...
What is that whore
You're living for?
You fill the house with bells...
But who can live like that?
You wanna speak like angels
But you can't
What is that, whore
You're living for?
You will get your...
