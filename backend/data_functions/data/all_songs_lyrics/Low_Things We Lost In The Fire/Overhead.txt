Overhead LyricsWanted
Bring him back alive if you can
All said
You can tell your lies to the dead
Overhead
You don't have to like
What you're fed
Overhead
Overhead
Wanted
Bring him back alive if you can
Trusted
You don't know how fast it could end
Overhead
You don't have to like
What you're fed
Overhead
Overhead
