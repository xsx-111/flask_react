Medicine Magazine LyricsThey'll never cure this thing
With medicine and magazines
I know you play your part
You cover up your ever-breaking heart
No one knows where you are
And no one thought you'd ever get that far
And how can it be that fun
When everyone around you dies so young?
And I'm not your favorite one
But who will walk you out when it's all done?Embed
