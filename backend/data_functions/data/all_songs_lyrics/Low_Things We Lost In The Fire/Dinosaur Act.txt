Dinosaur Act Lyrics
You were their daughter
And your father
Flew airplanes

You and your sister
Could tell by the back of their hands

It was a dinosaur act
Dinosaur act
Dinosaur act
Dinosaur act

And after expenses
And pulling up fences
No more airplanes

And putting your foot down
A nail shot up like a bright red snowflake

Just like a dinosaur act
Dinosaur act
Dinosaur act
Dinosaur act
Dinosaur
Ooh

And all through the dust
You feel that you must hear the strings of a dove
But it's a dinosaur act

Dinosaur act
Dinosaur act
Dinosaur act
