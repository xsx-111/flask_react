Sunflower Lyrics
When they found your body
Giant X's on your eyes
With your half of the ransom
You bought some sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet sunflowers
And gave them
To the night

Underneath the Star of David
A hundred years behind my eyes
And with my half of the ransom
I bought some sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet sunflowers
And gave them
To the night

Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet sunflowers
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet sunflowers
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet sunflowers
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet sunflowers
And gave them
To the night2Embed
