Embrace LyricsHolding my head
For the last of the race
Pushing my body
To get that embrace
It won't last
Hold on fast
It won't last
Hold on fast
Breathing in time
So hard to trace
Crushing your skull
With my warming embrace
It won't last
Hold on fast
It won't last
Hold on fast
I fell down the stairs
I wished I were dead
You ran toward the light
He handed me your head
It won't last
It won't last
Hold on fast
It won't last
Hold on fastEmbed
