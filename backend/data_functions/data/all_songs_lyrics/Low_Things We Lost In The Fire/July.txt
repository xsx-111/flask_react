July LyricsWait it's late we've missed the date
Gone I guess with the rest
They'll never wake us in time
They'll never wake us in time
Maybe we'll wait 'til July
Now at last I hear them pass
Gone I guess with the rest
They'll never wake us in time
They'll never wake us in time
Maybe we'll wait 'til July
Then August
September
October
November
Or DecemberEmbed
