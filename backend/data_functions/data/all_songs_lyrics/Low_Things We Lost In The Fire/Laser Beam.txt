Laser Beam LyricsI don't need a laser beam
I don't need the time
Leave me in the car tonight
Rest your drunken mind
I need your grace alone
Lesser things are on your mind
Don't you think I know?
Will this poison scar my eyes?
Mother, close the door
I need your grace alone
I don't need a laser beam
I don't need a laser beamEmbed
