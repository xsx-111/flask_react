Kind of Girl LyricsHalf your life you kept it in
Born without a stomach
Now the thread around you spins
No, you're not that kind of girl
No, you could've had the world
Every time they lift you up
Every time more thread to cut
Seems like you've been cut enough
No, you're not that kind of girl
No, you could've had the world
Now lesser things
Pull the strings
Of priests and kings
No, you're not that kind of girl
No, you could've had the world1Embed
