Like a Forest LyricsBlack, like a forest
And still, like a lion
My knees are bended
We used to speak
A different language
I wasted my breath
On words soon forgotten
Left unattended
They're moving their feet
But nobody's dancing
Ah, take your time
Ah, take your time
How can I blame you
For all of the screaming
That I've had to turn to?
Just in time
To go off in my handsEmbed
