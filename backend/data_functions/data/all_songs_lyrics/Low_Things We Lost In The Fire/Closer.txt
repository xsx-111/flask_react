Closer LyricsHold me closer than that
Hold me closer than that
How'd we get here so fast?
Hold me closer than that
On a dark, raging sea
Ships lay sleeping beneath
Overhead, spinning past
Hold me closer than that
Things we lost in the fire
How'd we ever get by?
Words will never take back
Hold me closer than that
Hold me closer than that
Hold me closer than that
How'd we get here so fast?
Hold me closer than that
