This Means War Lyrics
So nice to see ya here
Impolite would only be beneath us
It's been what? Half a year?
Like nothing ever happened in-between us
Fill me in on how you've been
And I would tell you anything you'd like to hear now

And we can laugh some
Reminisce some
From the same old stories to the new ones
When the night's done, I will just see you around

But that’s not what I came here for, my amour
I hate to admit it but I miss the war
Oh
Gotta get you under fire quick
Brace for it
I’d rather be a riot than be indifferent
Oh
Oh this means war, yeah
This means, this means, this means, this means war

I'm calm, I'm sure of it
Don't shake cause I've never even rattled
It's a good school, I've heard of it
You want to move away; surrender from the battle
I just wished you'd open fire on me
So I can see you still worry
If I care
And you can laugh some
Reminisce some
From the same old stories to the new ones
When the nights done, you'll just see me around

But that’s not what I came here for, my amour
I hate to admit it but I miss the war
Oh
Gotta get you under fire quick
Brace for it
I’d rather be a riot than be indifferent
Oh
This means war, yeah
This means, this means, this means, this means war

Fire in the
Fire in the
Fire in the
Fire in the hole ooh
Fire in the
Fire in the, oh
Fire in the
Fire in the hole
Take cover baby
Take cover baby
Take cover oh yeah
Take cover, take cover, baby
Take cover
Came for, my amour
I hate to admit it but I miss the war
Oh
Gotta get you under fire quick
Brace for it
I’d rather be a riot than be indifferent
Oh
This means war
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole (yeah)
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole (This means, this means...)
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
Fire in the hole10Embed
