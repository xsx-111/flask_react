Astoria LyricsAstoria, I'm warning you
Not ready yet, not for you
Don't want to know my darkest lows
My blackest pitch, murder of crows
Feels far from home close to the veil
Goodbye mother's fairy tale
Never after will suffice
When star-crossed lovers take their life
Now we begin, a harlequin
Kaleidoscope in spite of when
Top of the world
To lowest worth
From blackest pearl to slow rebirth
Don't remind me what the price is
When left to my own devices
Cause I'll find out in all due time
What happens to never say die
I'll see whatever doesn't make me stronger kills me
But it's gonna be a long year
Till the hospital can find hope in me
Tell me I survive
Do I survive you Astoria
Tell me I survive
Do I survive you Astoria?
Do you know everything happens
It happens in threes
A fever blur through names obscured
And speech is slurred
What's another bridge burned?
I'm on my own
You came alone
All dressed up in bad news
I know you've been hurt too
This would be the wrong move
And maybe we should leave soon
You can lay with me while you think of him
Drown our sorrows deep in each other's skin
I touch your face while I think of her
I won't raise my lips to the way we were
Bite my neck while you say his name
I will scratch your back to forget her face
Our regret is sweet through a soft liquor
We can raise our lips to the way we were
On a good day I'm the bad news
For the wrong girl with the right wounds
On a good day I'm the bad news
For the wrong girl with the right wounds
Hey, ever just say fuck it?
Maybe I'll drink this all away in buckets
Oh, hey, might as well say fuck it
I want to hurt myself until I love it
I shoulda known you're not alone
When you take somebody home
And the little deaths
Are a little less even if just for a moment
Aye, let's all say fuck it
I'm gonna make my mother so proud of it
Hope fades away in Astoria
I'll see whatever doesn't make me stronger kills me
But it's going to be a long year
Till the hospital might find hope in me
Astoria
Astoria
Astoria
Let the melody save me Astoria
Let the melody save me Astoria
The quid pro quos that will compose
From esoteric to common prose
