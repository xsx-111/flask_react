Yesterday Lyrics
You got me freaking out
I guess we're even now
Baby why you leaving now?
You should see me now
Been knocking on the wood
And lately I've been looking good
Baby, I just wish you could
Come by the neighborhood

B-b-b-back in time have you heard the news?
Love like mine met with mixed reviews
Don't you want to kiss me someday too?
Could be a party let's dance
Last words famous
I got to say this
Right here now
Tomorrow's a day away
Don't let go tonight, by tomorrow this will be yesterday
Last words famous
I got to say this right here now
Tomorrow's a day away
Don't let go tonight, by tomorrow this will be yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday it's just a day away
It's just a day away
Don't know where you went
No object permanence
You see, I looked up what it meant
And now it's making sense
So yeah, my timing sucks
I'm just so good at fucking up
But I'm fixing to change my luck
Turns out enough's enough

B-b-b-back in time have you heard the news?
Love like mine met with mixed reviews
Don't you want to kiss me someday too?
Could be a party let's dance
Last words famous
I got to say this right here now
Tomorrow is a day away
Don't let go tonight, by tomorrow this will be yesterday
Last words famous
I got to say this right here now
Tomorrow is a day away
Don't let go tonight, by tomorrow this will be yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday it's just a day away
It's just a day away
Last words famous
I got to say this
Right here now
Tomorrow is a day away
Don't let go tonight by tomorrow this will be yesterday
Last words famous
I got to say this, right here now
Tomorrow is a day away
Don't let go tonight, by tomorrow this will be yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday,yesterday
Last words famous
I got to say this
Right here now
Tomorrow is a day away
Don't let go tonight by tomorrow this will be yesterdayEmbed
