End Of An Era LyricsOne last cue, from love true
To final adieu
Hearts will break
For future's sake
But mine just won't take
Can't love if you don't
I can't try if you won't
Oh I know, please just let me go
My dear, cause I'd stay near
And lose my self here
Astoria I'm warning you
I'm comin' for
Comin' for ya
It's do or die for you and I
I'll never be taken alive
Here's everything that led me here
Our future still remains unclear
High time I face you, Astoria
So get up and face me
Astoria
Come and face the music
Astoria
It’s about fucking time now
Astoria
I’m wasting away here
Astoria
Goodbye Astoria
I’m so afraid of trying something new
Cause every start begins
With saying goodbye to you
Our heart divides an unrequited view
But my heart is overdue
I feel so ashamed
Wish this was easy
I want you to know
This never was the man I hoped to be
By now
(How did we survive)
We went through hell in Astoria
(How did we survive)
We lost ourselves in Astoria
(How did we survive)
I gave in to sickness
Can you find forgiveness
For a dear old friend
So Astoria can end
It’s time Astoria
It’s time now Astoria
I’m in over my head
(End of the line now Astoria)
(Hope’s fading into Astoria)
This is our goodbye
(Never say die in Astoria)
This is our goodbye
(Never say die in Astoria)
If we shadows have offended
I hope your heart can still be mended
I hope you know that I don’t blame you
My dear friend
Always will
Love you still
But Astoria must end2Embed
