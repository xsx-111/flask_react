Shut Up and Kiss Me Lyrics
You can say I kinda borrowed  this
But if you’re young, it’s new, I guess
And I don't want you leaving me now
You can say that I don't know romance
I can sing but I can't dance
And I don't want you leaving me now
Oh well you say I'm a mess
You say everything but a yes
Say you'll never date me
Say your mom will hate me

Or you can just shut up
Shut up Shut up Shut up
Shut up and kiss me
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up and kiss me
And you can say you won't
And you could tell me no, and you can let me go
Or maybe if you don’t, then just
Shut up
Shut up shut shut
Shut up and kiss me

Sha nah nah nah×2
(The higher we go
The more you say no
So let's get down low)
Baby don't say to me
You should stay away from me
Cause I don't want you leaving me now
Oh you say I don't listen right
I only hear just what I like
I don't want you leaving me now
You think I'm a mess
You say everything but a yes
Say you'll never date me, say you'll mom'll hate me
Or you can just shut up
Or you can just shut up
Shut up Shut up Shut up
Shut up and kiss me
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up and kiss me
And you can say you won't
And you could tell me no, and you can let me go
Or maybe if you don’t, then just
Shut up
Shut up shut shut
Shut up and kiss me

You gotta shut shut
Shut shut shut
Shut shut shut shut up
Shut shut shut shut up
You gotta shut up
Shut up shut shut up shut up
And kiss me


Or you can just shut up
Shut up Shut up Shut up
Shut up and kiss me
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up and kiss me
And you can say you won't
And you could tell me no, and you can let me go
Or maybe if you don’t, then just
Shut up
Shut up shut shut
Shut up and kiss me
Shut your mouth and kiss me baby
Shut up
Don't sound like Mike did
No but it's all right for a white kid
Sound like Mike did
No but it's alright for a white kid1Embed
