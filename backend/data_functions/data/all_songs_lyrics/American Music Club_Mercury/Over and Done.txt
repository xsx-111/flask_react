Over and Done LyricsCapp Street is an underwater cave
That's filled with crutches and canes
And faces that were washed away
Away from innocence and pain
They don't care who lost or won
They just wanna get the whole thing over and done
They keep me up all night
Their sweet songs to the moon
Wishing they could close their eyes
But they're waiting for Jacques Cousteau
Yeah, the girls outside, they're not waiting for the sun
They just wanna get the whole thing over and done
Over and done, over and done
Seems like I could boil history down
To a forty-five minute wait
A big boredom filled with stars
All burning with hate
Yeah we had a good time, we had some fun
And now we wanna get the whole thing over and done
Yeah we had a good time, we had some fun
And now we wanna get the whole thing over and doneEmbed
