Hollywood 4-5-92 LyricsMy revenge against the world is to believe everything you say
Balanced as you are on a pile of empty bottles
And even when the world has taken all your defenses away
And there's no way that you can be true
I'll believe you
I'll believe you
Don't you get sick of party favors
That start with a whimper and end with a whisper?
And even when every single one of your gestures is a lie
To me, you always ring true
I'll believe you
I'll believe you
The first time the cops came, yeah, they were like bright new friends
The second time they came they were a little concerned
They said, "We know all about you, you're like moths to our flame."
"Yeah we see too much and none of it's ever true."
What happens to the rat that stops running the maze
The doctors think it's dumb when it's just disappointed
I meant it when I said that I would never see you again
But no matter how dumb I get, there's one thing I'll always do
I'll believe you
I'll believe you
I'll believe you
I'll believe youEmbed
