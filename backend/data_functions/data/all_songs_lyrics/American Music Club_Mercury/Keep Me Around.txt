Keep Me Around LyricsThere's so little love left in my heart
For anyone, for anyone
I'm like an ant on your map
You can't see me going down the drain
You can't see me going down
Will you keep me around?
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
I've got nothing to hold on to
The sound the air makes as I fall
Is like a laugh that was torn
From where nothing was before
From when things just seemed the same
How did I get so far down?
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
If you don't want me, why don't you say?
Why don't you tell me? Why don't you tell me?
If you don't want me, why don't you say?
Why don't you tell me? Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
I've been cut off for so long from anyone, from anyone
My face is like a broken map and I can't go anywhere
Will you keep me around
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around? (Will you keep me around?)
Will you keep me around, will you keep me around?Embed
