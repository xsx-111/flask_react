Gratitude Walks LyricsWhy don't you be good for something
And draw down the shade
On a sign that sat up all night shivering
On a sign that sat up all night afraid
One that shines on the oasis that
Leads a man to drink
Drunk on the kind of applause
That gets louder the lower you sink
Gratitude walks
Gratitude walks
Gratitude walks on Sixth Street
Pull it from the air
And they throw it in the blue
And you're spinning under their wheels
Trapped in your room
And you're jumpy, you don't want to see
You don't want to see 'em have their fun
Oh, slap her face if she should laugh
Push him down if he should try and run
Gratitude walks
Gratitude walks
Gratitude walks on Sixth Street
Take a number for your big moment
They solved the rules of dreamland
In cottonwool, and cement
Well it's never what you want
It's just the kind of thing that always happens here
Yeah, you watch the good old days pass you by
Leaving your cupboards bare
Gratitude walks
Gratitude walks
Gratitude walks on Sixth Street
Hey, Gratitude walks
Gratitude walks
Gratitude walks on Sixth StreetEmbed
