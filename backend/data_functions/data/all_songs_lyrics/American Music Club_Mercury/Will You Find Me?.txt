Will You Find Me? LyricsIf you ask the man in the tollbooth, well I'm sure he'd tell you
That on the highways there's a million ways, if you wanna disappear
Should you take a left or a right? Well I'm sure I don't care
All I want out of life is to hide somewhere
Will you find, will you find me?
Will you find, will you find me?
Each Halloween your faces get more frightening
The closer I look the more I can see your limits begin to show
The astronaut won first prize, It was was a ton of moon dust
All I see in his eyes are years of hate and mistrust
Will you find, will you find me?
Will you find, will you find me?
"Come out come out wherever you are," said the fisherman to the sea
Oh I miss you, yeah, I miss you love. Where can you be?
If I have to wait anymore then I won't believe
In the love that I've known, or in the life that I have known
Will you find, will you find me?
Will you find, will you find me?Embed
