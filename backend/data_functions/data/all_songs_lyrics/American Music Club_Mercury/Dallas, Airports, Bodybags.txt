Dallas, Airports, Bodybags LyricsShuffling through people like cards
I can't find anyone to take my losing hand
Winning streak left me high and dry
A winning streak that slowly drains from the line
Hanging by a thread
I'm hanging by a thread
"Forget me, forget me," I pray to the day
Tired of being stuck on a pin
Forget me, forget me, don't see me this way
Jumpin' out of my skin, jumpin' out of my skin
Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
Shuffling through people like cards
Oh, let them blow around like sand
Maybe it'll uncover some beauty in their eyes
Maybe it'll give me a place to breathe
Maybe give me some room to stand
I'm hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a threadEmbed
