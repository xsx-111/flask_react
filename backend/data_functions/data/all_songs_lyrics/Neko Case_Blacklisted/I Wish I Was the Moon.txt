I Wish I Was the Moon Lyrics
Chimney falls and lovers blaze
Thought that I was young
Now I've freezing hands and bloodless veins
As numb as I've become

I'm so tired
I wish I was the moon tonight

Last night I dreamt
I'd forgotten my name
'Cause I had sold my soul
But I woke just the same
I'm so lonely
I wish I was the moon tonight

God blessed me, I'm a free man
With no place free to go
Paralyzed and collared-tight
No pills for what I fear

This is crazy
I wish I was the moon tonight
Chimney falls as lovers blaze
I thought that I was young
Now I've freezing hands and bloodless veins
As numb as I've become

I'm so tired
I wish I was the moon tonight

How will you know
If you found me at last
'Cause I'll be the one, be the one, be the one
With my heart in my lap
I'm so tired, I'm so tired
And I wish I was the moon tonight

I'm so tired, I'm so tired
And I wish I was the moon
I'm so tired, I'm so tired
And I wish I was the moon tonight3Embed
