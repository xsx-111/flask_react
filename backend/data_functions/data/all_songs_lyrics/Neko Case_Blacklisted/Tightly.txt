Tightly LyricsWhen I'm walkin' under stars
I covet all the waning hours
All the lonely houses stand like monuments
To thieves
When I'm walkin' in the dark
I'm free to covet all I want
You've made it all so very dangerous
I can't stay away
When I'm walkin' under trees
I'm free to covet all I please
New moon's in the alley
And its madness calls to me
Tonight, tonight, tonight...
If I meet you in the night
You're free to covet all you like
Don't you try and stop me
I cling tightly to this lifeEmbed
