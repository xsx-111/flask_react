Stinging Velvet LyricsRain falls, I fix my eyes
Let go of the focus
And I blur out all the lines
Just to remember, remember
Crying 'cause it's not my fault
Water through my lashes
Look just like Christmas lights
And I still remember, remember
Cold and shivering
Cold and shivering
Cold and shivering warm
Ooh, ooh
Sing please, rock me to sleep
Quiet as a canyon
Up under heaven's eaves
I surrender, surrender
Downstairs the furnace swells
Safe from all the horrors
In your stinging velvet arms
And I surrender, surrender
Cold and shivering
Cold and shivering
Cold and shivering warm
Cold and shivering
Cold and shivering
Cold and shivering warmEmbed
