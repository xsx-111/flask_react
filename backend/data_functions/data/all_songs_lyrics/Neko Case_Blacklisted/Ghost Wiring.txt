Ghost Wiring LyricsWhat happens at home since I've gone away
Needles drop soft and sharp
And the leaves gently sway
Low ceiling moves in and circles the bay
Rain rakes the trees
The sound that's counted so many days
So many days
Wet shoes drag you off to school
Shoes that never dry
Crows curse and beat their wings
Why can't you be smarter girl?
Lift up your face
Don't feel sorry for yourself
I'll always wait for you
Your ghost is a lightshow at night
On the Grand Coulee Dam
The river is watching you
At the drive-in tonight
Who do they comfort now
Since I've gone awayEmbed
