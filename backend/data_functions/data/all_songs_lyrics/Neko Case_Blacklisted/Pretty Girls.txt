Pretty Girls LyricsPretty girls
You're too good for this
How you break my heart
In this cold waiting room
Oh my, pretty girls
You're too good for this
Don't let 'em tell you you're nothing
Don't let 'em break your hearts, too
The TV is blaring and angry
As if you don't know why you're here
Those who walk without sin are so hungry
Don't let the wolves in, pretty girls
Your hearts are so trite and so innocent
Wind your flimsy blue gowns tight around you
Around curves so comely and sinister
They blame it on you, pretty girls
Oh, pretty girls
You're too good for this
How you break my heart
In this cold waiting room
Oh my, pretty girls
You're too good for this
Don't let 'em tell you you're nothing
Don't let 'em break your hearts, too
My girls, you're just like the heavens
Not a soul to take your hand in theirs
Your tears and wild constellations
Broad limbs and hard folding chairs
But there's millions to count you and keep you
And lovers that don't understand
Don't let 'em tell you you're nothing
'Cause you'll change the world, pretty girls
Come chain yourself 'round my ankles
You'll see the world like a bird
Diving down low, flying up high
Through all of these saccharine gutters we'll ride
And I won't say that I told you so
Won't say that I told you so
Won't say that I told you so
Won't say that I told you soEmbed
