Deep Red Bells Lyrics
He led you to this hiding place
His lightening threats spun silver tongues
The red bells beckon you to ride
A handprint on the driver's side
It looks a lot like engine oil
And tastes like being poor and small
And popsicles in summer

Deep red bells, deep as I have been done
Deep red bells, deep as I have been done

It always has to come this
The red bells ring this tragic hour
She lost sight of the overpass
But daylight won't remember that
When speckled fawns graze ‘round your bones’
Who took the time to fold your clothes
And shook the Valley of the Shadow?

Deep red bells, deep as I have been done
Deep red bells, deep as I have been done
Where does this mean world cast its cold eye?
Who's left to suffer long about you?
Does your soul cast about like an old paper bag
Past empty lots and early graves?
All those like you who lost their way
Murdered on the interstate
While the red bells rang like thunder

Deep red bells, deep as I have been done
Deep red bells, deep as I have been done2Embed
