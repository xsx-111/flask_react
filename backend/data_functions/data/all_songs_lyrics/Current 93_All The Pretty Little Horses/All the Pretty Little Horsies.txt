All the Pretty Little Horsies LyricsHush-a-bye
Don't You cry
Go to sleepy little baby
Go to sleepy little baby
When You wake
You shall have
All the pretty little horsies
All the pretty little horsies
Blacks and bays
Dapples and greys
All the pretty little horses
Way down yonder in the meadow lies a poor little lamby
Bees and butterflies flitting round his eyes
Poor little thing is crying "Mammy"
Go to sleep
Don't you cry
Rest your head upon the clover
Rest your head upon the clover
In your dreams
You shall ride
While your Mammy's watching over
Blacks and bays
And dapples and greys
All the pretty little horsies
All the pretty little horsies
All the pretty little horsiesEmbed
