The Inmost Night LyricsAnd I drown a little more every day
The wind blows so slowly now
The trees are dry dead
Walls to me they cannot hold back the storm any longer
It will break around us first
If there's a god
If there's a God
When I stand there at the piled blood camp
Again I flick open the inner eye
If you too open your eyes you shall see
The entire sky filled with weeping angels
The entire heaven filled with weeping angels
And the central sun and sum of all
God too weeping
We shall be judged
So anyway so your garden is most full green
And the many birds alight on its budding branches
And anyway the lambs gambol
And the children sing
Yours perhaps
Or mine God
And anyway
So anyway we fall beneath the waves
And hope to be remembered anyway
Anyway the bluebirds wait over the white cliffs of Dover
So anyway they too fall
The grass dies
The moss goes
The chalk chips away
Then below that the rocks grain away
This is the sound of the earth dying
So nothing new
So anyway you may wait under a tree
Or at the foot of a hill
AnywayEmbed
