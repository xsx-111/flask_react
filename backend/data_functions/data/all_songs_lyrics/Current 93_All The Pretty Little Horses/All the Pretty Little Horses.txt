All the Pretty Little Horses LyricsHush-a-bye
Don't you cry
Go to sleepy little baby
Go to sleepy little baby
When you wake
You shall have
All the pretty little horsies
All the pretty little horsies
Blacks and bays
Dapples and greys
All the pretty little horsies
Way down yonder
In the meadow
Lies a poor little lamby
Bees and butterflies
Flitting round his eyes
Poor little thing is crying
"Mammy"
Go to sleep
Don't you cry
Rest your head upon the clover
Rest your head upon the clover
In your dreams
You shall ride
Whilst your mammy's watching over
Blacks and bays
Dapples and greys
All the pretty little horsies
All the pretty little horsies
All the pretty little horsies
All the pretty little horsies1Embed
