The Carnival Is Dead and Gone LyricsDear sir, dear lady
This carnival is dead and gone
And never anyway alas this party never yet began
The chairs and tables dust of dust
Yes very dust of very rust of very must and farewell trust
I thought I saw you in the crowd dear heart
You turned away from me and then you dissolved into light
The broken lights and faded buntings
Call to us all the Inmost Light
And don't glare wide your eyes in wonder
They will flick back inside your mind
And on the bone screen of your skull
They watch no musical salutes
So thoroughly modern now are we
But the last reel of all time
The Inmost Night
It's frames are glared and slow and out of focus
Valentino Vallee Moss all dead!
The Inmost Night
And the little bells go tinkle
And your eyes begin to twinkle
And the joints and sinews crack
It's the expansion of your mind
Death!
Death!
Death!
Death!
Death!
The Inmost Night
The cat's face glares from shiny card
The dead cats from my past
You tumble you froth and fun forever
An orchestra from another time
Another world all dead
The church bells silent
The rain stained glass of God is smashed
And you take your choice you sup with the devil
You choke on your pride for ever and ever
My memory of my Inmost Light
It tumbles froth and fun forever
Vulvaic memories imagined of my would-be-life
Well that won't be
And that won't be
And that won't be
And that won't be
And for my troubles and my pain
And for the losses and the wains
I get a picture in my mind
The slyly smily sly kiss
Of your sweet heart and face
And your legs in some final benediction
Your Inmost Warm heart says ta-ra
And I wished to die inside of you
And push up into your heart so violently
That face to face with matrix creatrix am
The Inmost Light
The Inmost NightEmbed
