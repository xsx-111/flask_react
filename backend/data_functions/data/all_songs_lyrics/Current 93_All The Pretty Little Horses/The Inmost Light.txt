The Inmost Light LyricsThough I walk through valley after valley after valley
And find only shadows
Though I walk and find only shadow
The sun falls behind the yew bushes
I, young in different shapes, stand next to them
The old chapel is to my right
The shadows then lengthen and there again the long shadows fall
When I saw the shadows and stars fall around me as a boy
I knew this world
All we see
Be
And are
Is imperium
Empire of NothingEmbed
