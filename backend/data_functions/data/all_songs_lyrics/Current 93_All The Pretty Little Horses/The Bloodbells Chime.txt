The Bloodbells Chime LyricsSell all you have
Give it to the kittens
And pour the milk on Louis' grave
And Catland sometimes called Pussydom
Opens for you instantly
It's the inmost light!
It's the inmost light
Somewhere over the rainbow
On the good ship lollipop
There oh there
(Goodnight)
The inmost light
The happy children rise all from their pools
Eyes still sealed
(Sleep tight)
With mud and night
It's their inmost night
(Goodnight)
And yet still I wish I could dream
As when young
(Sleep tight)
As she came to me so young
And honest
(Goodbye)
Yet the bloodbells chime
I do not notice them
I shall not notice them
Yet the bloodbells chime
Tommy Katkins still send his regards
Frozen forever on some Animal Somme
The last thing on his mind is marriage
But the call of home and heart
Yet the bloodbells chime
Yet the bloodbells chime
Yet the bloodbells chime1Embed
