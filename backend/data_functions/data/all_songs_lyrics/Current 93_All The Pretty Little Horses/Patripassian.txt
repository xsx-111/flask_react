Patripassian Lyrics
The rivers of Babylon flow
And fall
And carry away
Jesus is alone on earth
Not merely with no one to feel and share His agony
But with no one even to know of it
Heaven and he are the only ones to know
Jesus is in a garden
Not of delight
Like the first Adam
Who there fell and took with him all mankind
But of agony
Where He has saved Himself and all mankind
He suffers this anguish and abandonment in the horror of the night
Jesus will be in agony until the end of the world
There must be no resting in the meantime1Embed
