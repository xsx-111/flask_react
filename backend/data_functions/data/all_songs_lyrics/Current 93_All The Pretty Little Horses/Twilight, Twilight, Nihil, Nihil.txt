Twilight, Twilight, Nihil, Nihil LyricsWho will deliver me from this body of death?
Who will deliver me from this body of death?
Who will deliver me from this body of death?
Who will deliver me from this body of death?
There is no refuge
I have found the word does not save
There is no refuge
In the rock or stone
There is no refuge
In the wind or other forces of nature
The fire especially especially does not save
The fire only destroys
And though it may purify it takes takes takes
And gives nihil back nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil
And the holybooks alas have not
Will not alas can not save nihil nihil nihil
This is the chorus of the wind
The sun the moon the waters all blue all green or stagnant
Nihil they sing nihil
The inmost light nihil, nihil
The inmost light nihil, nihil
The inmost light nihil
Finally the child aged dies and sings
Nihil this swansong towards nothing
Nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil
We need not not not blow out the candle
Nihil, nihil
It dies anyhow
Nihil, nihil, nihil
Who will deliver me from this body of death?
Nihil, nihil, nihil
Who will deliver me from this body of death?
Nihil call me nihil, nihil
The stars are so far
I had thought not but nihil, but nihil
The great king is dead
The great queen is dead
Their child stillborn
And so nihil nihil nihil nihil
They call the inmost light
But hear nihil, nihil, nihil
Who will deliver me from this body of death?
Who will deliver me from this body of death?
Nihil, nihil, nihil
I felt I saw you coming over the water
Without you I am nothing
And still I see you
Nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil
In the room where
Nihil, nihil, nihil
The wineglass shattered in the box I gave it to you
Nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil
Shattered
Nihil
I thought I saw you waving to me over the bay
Nihil, nihil, nihil
You waved
Nihil
Why we have no words any longer
To say to one another
Your mouth opens and
Nihil, nihil, nihil
Bend your face to kiss you said nihil
Bend your arms to hold you said nihil
And nihil, nihil, nihil
There is nothing there
Nihil, nihil, nihil
Bend your face to kiss you said
The waters arise and take me finally
And my remembrance is
Nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil, nihil2Embed
