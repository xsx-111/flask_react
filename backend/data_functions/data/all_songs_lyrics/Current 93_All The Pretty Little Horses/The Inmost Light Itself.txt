The Inmost Light Itself Lyrics
And when I saw the little children sing
Their mouths were red and sad
(their lipstick sealed smiles)
And in their minds they hold and hope some sign
(Some hope)
The gaudy sequinned dragging banner of
The Inmost Light
Around my eyes the sewers spew and laugh
The fallen flower gazes at me reaped
The crippled cuckoo falls broken wing
And turns around to me and broken beak grins
From its head:
"Thus so: no fear: thus so: It has arrived:
The Inmost Light"
And if I turn my head for shame
And see my lovers' rivers burst and folding there
I'll cross my eyes and close my heart
And whisper to her womb
"Great blood great silence my mother mystery of all
Nothing may grasp Thee no one may grasp Thee
Let me hold thee now Oh come oh come at last
The Inmost Light"
Oh God I trail my hands up to my eyes
Up to my eyes up to my eyes up to my eyes
And say "if only then my Light" -- And "if only if only if:
I had not despised
The Inmost Light
(And so I kneel at blue gate black mouth death
And offer as my feeble explanation:
"I thought so much was left and so much
Time to praise and call The Inmost Light ")
And I suppose, full half and more of these are dreams
Some broken code of morals rising after I had touched
Her very pith and marrow-oh! her Inmost Light
If I could scatter children
If I could scatter children
And while I gaze and count my coins
(After Your god gold glow they're dead;
The head is dead and lead)
I see and feel the hiding glow blaze behind You:
The Inmost Light
And if Your lips are taut
Don't move Your teeth to speak
The lines will start to fall
And pull the structure of Your world
Then all apart
And thus You'll see You'll call The Inmost Night
(It whispered to me and laughed and said You
Lied and shamed The Inmost Light)
And if You recall I bent yew-like and roared
You did not see the cloudburst wind dead towards You
Of The Inmost Light
Our hands tumble towards the skies
To block out visions of The Inmost Light
And if I pointless arch
And spit white nothings at the sky
Oh Big boys check it out: too fucking late
(The children move through town
And skip torn skirted and roll the hoop into the arms
Of The Inmost Light)
Sheer, char, shrift and sharp
Christ is risen: You may creep to the Cross too late
But it's much too late to welcome
The Inmost Light
Branch, sallow, willow yew and tree
Not so gay no more
So falling faster and faster we fall
Nearer cataclysm
Or salvation
Or nothing - how terrible
If we are snuffed out, with just the momentary mark of smoke
To array our passing
So we stand, milky in moonlight
(Is this all there is?)
(Is this all there is?)
(Is this all there is?)
Our eyes so fixed
That the darkness surrounds us
Unnoticed
And we are drowned by the loss of light
Unnoticed
Is this all there is my friends?
Is this all there is?

Goodnight goodnight
The Inmost Light
Westron wynde, when wilt thou blow
The small raine down can raine. can raine
Cryst, if my love were in my armes
And I in my bedde again!

Where I come from, nobody knows
And where I am going, everything goes
The wind blows
The sea flows
Nobody knows
And where I am going, nobody knows
The little, white, bony 
Attack my little fingers
Dust
The choke of
The texture of
The smell of
The colour of
But quietly, drably
All hell floods out
If You open that door
As alabaster guardians for me
Hovering candles
Dragonflies and mayflies
Before I sputter out?
Will You meet me there?
One red bird
No more dying
By the dead clock
Will You wait for me there?
DEAD!
(By the dead clock)1Embed
