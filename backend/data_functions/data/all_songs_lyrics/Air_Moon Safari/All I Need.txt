All I Need Lyrics
All I need is a little time
To get behind this sun and cast my weight
All I need is a peace of this mind
Then I can celebrate

All in all there's something to give
All in all there's something to give
All in all there's something to do
All in all there's something to do
All in all there's something to live
With you (ooh)
With you (ooh-ahh)

Ah ooh ayyyy
Ah ooh ayyyy-ay
Ah ooh ayyyy

All I need is a little sign
To get behind this sun and cast this weight of mine
Get behind the sun
All I need is the place to find
And there I'll celebrate
All in all there's something to give
All in all there's something to give
All in all there's something to do
All in all there's something to do
All in all there's something to live
With you (ooh)
With you (ooh-ahh)

Ah ooh ayyyy
Ah ooh ayyyy-ay
Ah ooh ayyyy

All I need

Ah ooh ayyyy
Ah ooh ayyyy-ay
Ah ooh ayyyy
Ah ooh ayyyy-ay
Aah
