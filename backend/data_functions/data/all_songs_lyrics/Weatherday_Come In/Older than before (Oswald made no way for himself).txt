Older than before (Oswald made no way for himself) Lyrics
Come in, close the door
I'm older than before
Even I could grow
Into a massive bore
(I'm predictable
So why won't it show)

Hollowed out by midnight
Spent another party alone
You grow when you know
What you don't have anymore
(I'm predictable
So why won't it show)

Come in, close the door
I'm older than before
Even I could grow
Into a massive bore

Floored by midnight
Went to a party alone
You grow when you know
Who you don't have anymore
Who you don't have anymore
Who you don't have anymore
(I'm predictable
So why won't it show)
Come in, close the door
I'm older than before
Too bad you can't stay
Forgive that Thursday
Forgive that Thursday
(I'm predictable
So why won't it show)

I think I should head home
I don’t wanna go home
I don’t wanna go home
I don’t wanna go home
I don’t wanna go homeEmbed
