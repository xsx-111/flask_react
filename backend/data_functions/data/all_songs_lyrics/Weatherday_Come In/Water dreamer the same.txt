Water dreamer the same Lyrics
Maybe if I'd cut my hair
Bought new clothes
Grew my hair
Wore more blue
Green or black
Wrote you back
Kept more track
Drank more
Or less
Shared my thoughts
Let you in
Juuust fucking talked more
Would you still be around?

Coldest 2D sputnik space
Closest ghost asleep for days
Rubber card from darling’s place
Honey said she liked today
Calmest party ghost said hi
Freezing cups for fireworks
Bad news just before we sleep
Then feeling for the first time
Made it a night to remember
Cheers, my favourite disappointment!
The most least cathartic
By-the-water scene we ever filmed
And after wrapping up we felt empty and the same
Nothing gained but something to dream of
See, it can help if you want it to
There’s a drawback, but what comes without that?

You won’t fall in love
You won’t ever get hurt
Keep away, it’s not that hard
Starry space for you to use
Just what you yearned for
”Breathe in”
”Breathe out”
”Trace a square”

Always reminded of so many days
That made me feel less than this
Always reminded of so many days
That made me feel less like a fool
Less like a fool less like the fool
Always reminded
I have less important things to do
Always reminded
You are not around but not because you ever left
Always reminded
If you want me to I can walk home in the rain
Always reminded
Why do you care about me
(You make sure that it’s clear)
Why do you care about me
(You don’t really want me here)
Why do you care about me
(If I give you all my love)
Do you care about me
(And you’re all I’m thinking of)
Why do you care about me
(Why do you go out of your way)
Why do you care about me
(To avoid us every day)
Do you care about me
(If you say so)
Do you care about me
(If you say so)
Do you care about me
If you say so
Do you care about me
(If water dreamer is the same)
Do you care about me
(Always reminded of the shame)
Do you care about me
(All the days consumed)
Do you care about me
(When I hoped that you’d be near)Embed
