Embarrassing paintings (Agatha showed great initiative in art class this week) Lyrics
Can I show you what I drew today?
Don't you kinda look like that now?
It's convincing, right?
At least strangers think so
And you know...
Sometimes hair tangles like this
(Ines motions with her hair and lips and what’s supposed to be porcelain)
Yeah the hair helps, I guess

Back at last
And you’re working around that your ways
From your dark past
Have formed a mound
Pride has a face
Which you’re looking at now
In the reflection of your days
As something you disavow

Some things are better left alone
Still, she’s not comfortable being named a thing
(Not that anyone would be around to hear her)Embed
