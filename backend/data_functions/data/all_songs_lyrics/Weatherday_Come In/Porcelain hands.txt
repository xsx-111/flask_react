Porcelain hands Lyrics
Porcelain hands
Feel around
I can't see you here
"Just come in"

Porcelain hands
It's so dark
I feel far from here
"Are you sure?"

How the free fall feeling
From back home followed me here
Shouldn’t be this clouded
Not that anything is clear
Somewhere out there (somewhere out there)
I imagine her in my own sense
Dressed in porcelain fashion (dressed in porcelain fashion)
And like me, she’s acting tense

Porcelain hands
Are you there?
Was this real?
Look around
No one’s there
"Go to sleep"
When awake
I’m not me
If I'd fall
Down the stairs
And haunt a shell
That looks like me
Porcelain hands (I undress every day as the shape I was born)
You can’t fall (So today just for once, I’ll wear clothes under clothes)
Down the stairs (Painted face by painted nails)
To see yourself (After all this waiting)
I’m not some embarrassing painting

Anyway I would do anything for you
If it meant I’d get a small hint of warmth
Even when it truly felt like rooms got smaller
I would fight to stick around just in case you’d come in
You would come and knock three times on my door
I would tell you to come in and to stay
All I wanted was to be a part of your life
You’re invited so come in
Anyway I would do anything for you
If it meant I’d get a small hint of warmth
Even when it truly felt like rooms got smaller
I would fight to stick around just in case you’d come in
You would come and knock three times on my door
I would tell you to come in and to stay
All I wanted was to be a part of your life
You’re invited so come in5Embed
