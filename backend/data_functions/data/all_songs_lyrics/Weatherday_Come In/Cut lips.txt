Cut lips Lyrics
I don't remember most of all those months
I was not involved, hopeless semi-drive
Should I come to? Just for one sole hour
I could go ahead, didn’t go ahead
You tried our best
You gave our one last shot
(Now that it's become reality, I'm unsure of what to do)

Some way I found to end up further down than on you
It’s what I wanted and it happened and it happened too
Too late to come back with the right thing to say
And like a rhyme I saw it coming from so very far away

Come inside, I know it's cold
I don't know what you've been told
I don't see you, I just feel
You were good enough to kneel

Cut my lips and waking up
"Was it a dream?" Of course it's not
Wash your bloody sheets before I kiss them bye-bye
"Sure it's a dream," you say that now
And I hoped, in a way, that every time I'd leave
I might never, ever, ever, never see you again
But I always saw you
Came inside, I wasn’t cold
I won’t tell you what I'm told
I just watch you as you feel
Yes, I’m dumb enough to kneel
Cut my lips, sharper than knives
Bloody tongues, hung up insides
Carved in layered sheets in pain
First time I felt this insane4Embed
