Mio, min Mio Lyrics
Let's stay in
In your bed
In particular
Where our shared past used to be
Where we felt bad made a scene
We can sit down knee to knee
We can stay friends if you’re keen

Scented Memory
Just in case
This is our last good month
I’m scared
How could I surely know
How could I ever grow
My eyes scan
Just in case
This is our last good month
I’m scared
How could I surely know
How could I ever grow

Weather or not
You took my breath away, in a way
Smothered is an ok way to go
”Way to go!”
And I want to say thanks
Everything seeps away
Please hold me
Everything seeps away
Please hold on to me
Everything seeps away
Please hold me
Everything seeps away
Please hold on to me

It’s too rare in life
To find someone you love
That can stick around
(Everything seeps away
Please hold me
Everything seeps away
Please hold on to me)
After thunder clouds
It’s too rare in life
To find someone you love
To open up to (sometimes)
And not regret you did too2Embed
