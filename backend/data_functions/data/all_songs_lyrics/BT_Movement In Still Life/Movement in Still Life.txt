Movement in Still Life Lyrics
Hey cuz, I got your number, right?
I seen you up in this magazine
Dude told me you do some tracks right
I wanna be like getting with you 'n' make some beats
So call me back, I live in DC
And I'd like to... you know...
We get together and we make some money
I heard you dope, you da man
I got some fresh tracks and, uh, I make hits
I don't have no records out yet but... I make hits
So please call me back at this number
And if my mother say-
I might be at my grandmother's house
If my mother answer the phone, she'll give you my cousin beeper number
So let's write this off 
Peace out 
Dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Dance, dance to the beat, beat

That's right
Dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Dance dance to the beat beat

Dude told me you do some tracks right
I wanna be like getting with you 'n' make some beats
