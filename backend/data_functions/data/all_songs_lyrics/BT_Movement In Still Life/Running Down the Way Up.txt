Running Down the Way Up LyricsThe lower centers in me revolve around
Derive their meaning from my self will
As I watch the sun highlight your Midas touch
Conscious light gets through somehow
Yet I always fail to notice
Yet I always fail to notice
I'm always headed for the ground
The visible effect runs through my blood
As I watch the sun highlight your Midas touch
Conscious light gets through somehow
I always fail to notice
I'm heading for the ground
Has desire found a shady avenue?
(Standing above - below me)
Has desire found a shady avenue?
(Standing above - below me)
And I always fail to notice
Yet, I always fail to notice
Always running down the way up and you're standing there
(Running down...)
Always running down the way up and you're standing there
(Running down...)
Always running down the way up and you're standing there
(Running down...)
Always running down the way up and you're standing there
(Running down...)
And if we doubt we can hardly hope to shine
And the sun could eventually be outshone
Always running down the way up and you're standing there
(Running down...)
Always running down the way up and you're standing there
(Running down...)
Always running down the way up and you're standing there
(Running down...)
Always running down the way up and you're standing there
(Running down...)
Some conscious light gets through somehow
Yet, I fail to notice
Then I'm heading for the ground
Always running down the way up
Always running down the way up and you're standing there
(Running down...)
Always running down the way up and you're standing there
(Running down...)Embed
