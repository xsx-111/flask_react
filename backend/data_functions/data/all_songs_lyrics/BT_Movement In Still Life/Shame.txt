Shame Lyrics
A lonely doll
She came again
Frozen wall
Like teenage skin
And neither for
What comes within
A substance clouds like sinking sin

You told your great tale
And it's always the same
Quite a shame that it goes this way
Is what you said
How very bizarre
All those blood-letting games
Quite a shame that it goes this way
Is what you said
You told your great tale
And it's always the same
Quite a shame that it goes this way
Is what you said
How very bizarre
All those blood-letting games
Quite a shame that it goes this way
Is what you said
Lay me down
Oh such a shame

You told your great tale
And it's always the same
Quite a shame that it goes this way
Is what you said
How very bizarre
All those blood-letting games
Quite a shame that it goes this way
Is what you said
You told your great tale
And it's always the same
Quite a shame that it goes this way
Is what you said
How very bizarre
All those blood-letting games
Quite a shame that it goes this way
Is what you said

Still smell of fear
She came again
A frozen wall
Like teenage skin
She'll break my fall
Begin my friend
Some old substance clouds like sinking sin
You told your great tale
And it's always the same
Quite a shame that it goes this way
Is what you said
How very bizarre
All those blood-letting games
Quite a shame that it goes this way
Is what you said

It's such a shameEmbed
