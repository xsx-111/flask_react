Dreaming Lyrics
No words, no talk
We'll go dreaming
No pain, no hurt
We'll go dreaming

Walk with me
The future's at hand
Here with us
Here where we stand
We both know the power of pain
We get back up and start it again
With new hope, no place for tears
Leave behind those frozen years
Come with me and we'll go dreaming

We don't know how it can be
Searching out dignity
Nothing can be as savage as love
One taste is never enough
With new hope, no place for tears
Catch my hand and come with me
Close your eyes and dream
Dreaming
We'll go dreaming
We'll go dreaming
We'll go dreaming
We'll go

No words, no talk
We'll go dreaming
No pain, no hurt
We'll go dreaming
Catch my hand and come with me
Close your eyes and dream
No words, no talk
We'll go dreaming
No pain, no hurt
We'll go dreaming
No words, no talk
We'll go dreaming
No pain, no hurt
We'll go dreaming

Dreaming
We'll go dreaming
We'll go dreaming
We'll go dreaming
We'll go dreaming
We'll go dreaming
We'll go
Catch my hand and come with me
Close your eyes and dream
No words, no talk
We'll go dreaming
No pain, no hurt
We'll go dreaming
No words, no talk
We'll go dreaming
No pain, no hurt
We'll go dreaming
No words, no talk
We'll go dreaming
No pain, no hurt
We'll go dreaming
No words, no talk
We'll go dreaming
No pain, no hurt
We'll go dreamingEmbed
