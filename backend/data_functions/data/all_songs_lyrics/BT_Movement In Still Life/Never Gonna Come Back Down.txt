Never Gonna Come Back Down Lyrics
I'm just gonna shout this one, I'm just uhh, gonna gonna gonna gonna say this
To the people, not so much the people in the audience as the people sitting in
My mind
Donde esta los digits du DJ Rap?

I bring the sound to the people in a white truck
Bumpin' on the road bumps
Run into a tree stump
Tweeter out the back door
Slam into the dirt lot, stopped
With the cable runnin' out the backside
Disconnected
And if you had a chance-ah
You wouldn't even stop denying
Go talk to Anna Hand
Go start the multiplyin'

Green is like a boom to the what's dis non
Diddy on dawn to the don don diggy dawn
Green is like a boom to the what's dis non
Diddy on dawn to the don don diggy dawn
Doubt'll be the fire of your delight
But she's never gonna come back down
I have
The pop song on the five, but she's never gonna come back down
To grab
The t-shirt off the line, but she's never gonna come back down
I think she's murderously sly, but she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down

We are here to save the ERF
Uhhh, E-R-F uh....
Todd Berry Todd Berry I'm gonna pay you on a shorely rate, pay you on a shorely
Rate, rate, rate, rate, rate...

Oh when I woke up and got on the BMC
I saw the boom shudap and that's fresh to me ..
And they were scrawling on the window with wise-ass keys
And they were driving out the lots in their Mercurys
Green is like a boom to the what's dis non
Diddy on dawn to the don don diggy dawn
Green is like a boom to the what's dis non
Diddy on dawn to the don don diggy dawn
If you had a chance-ah
You wouldn't even stop denying
Go talk to Anna Hand
Go start the multiplyin'

Doubt'll be the fire of your delight
But she's never gonna come back down
I have
The pop song on the five, but she's never gonna come back down
To grab
The t-shirt off the line, but she's never gonna come back down
I think she's murderously sly, but she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down

He's the doom slinger, the dope beat stinger
Sucka DJs they get stopped by a
Single finger
Huh!
He's gonna bubble it up now
He likes to bubble it up, he likes to bubble it up, he likes to bubble it up
He likes to bubble it up
Mr. BT, Mr. BT, Mr. BT, Mr. BT
Please bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up
Could you bring it up?
Could you bring it up just a little more than that?
Could you bring it up?
Could you bring it up?
Could you bring it up just, could you bring it up?
Could you bring it up?
Could you bring it up?
Could you bring it up?
Say hallelujah peoples, say hallelujah oh yes!
Yes, yes in the name, the name of, in the naaaaame
In the name
And it was in my belly bitter
But in my mouth-ah, it was-ah sweeter

Doubt'll be the fire of your delight
But she's never gonna come back down
I have
The pop song on the five, but she's never gonna come back down
To grab
The t-shirt off the line, but she's never gonna come back down
I think she's murderously sly, but she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down
And she's never gonna come back down

You understand?
You know what I'm saying?
Rght on to the people up front
Right to the people in the back
Right on to the bartender
Right on to the waitresses
Right on to the DJ
Right on
Right on to the lady with the beer over there in the pink skirt
Right on to all them mmmmmm English girls named Charisse...
Fucking blonde English girls with ghetto names you know what I'm saying?
I love that shit
And the seven unders uttered
The seven thunders undered
The seven unders thundered
The seven unders thuddered, thuddered, thuddered, under, thuddered under
The seven thunders uttered
Charisse-ah
Fucking excellent man
That's what I do for a livingEmbed
