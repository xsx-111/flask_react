Mercury & Solace LyricsAwareness, the fruit of life
Awareness and happiness
Vibes...
The dance never ends
But I know you're there
But I know you're there
Only you are my happiness
Memories...
Happiness...
Lovely voices...
In nightfall I'll meet you
Seeds of desire absolve
There's no going back
I'm losing control
As the morning creeps up
And I'm looking for the shade
In your embrace
My grieving says
Reach out for me - reach out
Reach out for me - reach out
I know you're there...you're there
Reach out for me - reach out
Reach out for me - reach out
I may go with you
Reach out for me - reach out
Reach out for me - reach out
I savour every moment
I'll savour every moment
You're precious
You're precious to meEmbed
