Satellite LyricsSee here we have a beautiful view of the earth down below
As the satellite departs
She smells of the sun
And she's constantly saying
That's it's all a lie
Because lies, sound so nice
And like soil to seed goes
Casting my fears aside...
She says: "The satellite is coming."
I pray, the wrecking ball is waiting
She says: "The satellite is coming
It's come to take us home."
Satellite...
Still smells of the sun
And the light that brings healing
Is burning my eyes
And the dark, seems so nice
And I'm choking on blessings, that I can receive
I hide
She says: "The satellite is coming."
I pray, the wrecking ball is waiting
She says: "The satellite is coming
It's come to take us home."
She says: "The satellite is coming."
I pray, the wrecking ball is waiting
She says: "The satellite is coming
It's come to take us home."
She says: (Satellite)
"The satellite is comming"
I pray, (She)
The wrecking ball is waiting
She says: "The Satellite is comming
It's come to take us home."Embed
