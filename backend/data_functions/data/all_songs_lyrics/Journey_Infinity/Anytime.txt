Anytime Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you need me

Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me to
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you need me

I'm standing here with my arms a mile wide
Hoping and praying for you
Listen to me and enlighten me, yeah
I hope that you need me too, 'cause

Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you need me

Give me all of your sunshine
A spark is all I need
To take it away, all of the shadows
Well, what more can I say, yeah, yeah

Oh, anytime at all
Anytime at all
Anytime at all
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you need me

Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me to
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me

Ooh, ooh, anytime that you need me
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me toEmbed
