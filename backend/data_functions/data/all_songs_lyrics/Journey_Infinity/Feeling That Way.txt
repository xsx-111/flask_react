Feeling That Way Lyrics
Opened my eyes to a new kind of way
All the good times that you saved
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too
Or am I just
Am I just a fool

When the summer's gone
She'll be there... standing by the light
What she's been to, where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling?

Are you feeling, you feeling that way too?
Or am I just, am I just a fool?
A new road's waiting, you touched my life, oh
Soft and warm on a summer's night
You're the only one, I told you, the only one I love
The lovely one, I'm thinking of
When the summer's gone
She'll be there standing by the light
What she's been to, where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling?
Are you feeling, you feeling that way too?
Or am I just, am I just a fool?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
You feelin' that way?
When the summer's gone
She'll be there standing by the light
What she's been to, where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling?

Are you feeling, you feeling that way too?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, feeling that way
When the summer's gone
She'll be there standing by the light
What she's been to, where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling?

(Whoaaaaaa)
Whoa, is she feeling? (Feeling that way?)
Oh, my my, oh whoa
Oh, oh, whoa, oh oh whoa
Whoa, whoa oh oh
Whoa, whoa oh oh
My my my my
My my my my my whoa
Oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, whoa
Feeling that wayEmbed
