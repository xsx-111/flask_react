Who Was It LyricsWho was it that caught you falling
And put you back on your feet
Who was it that tripped you any way
(In order that the two of us would meet)
It was me and I'll tell you why
Oh! I did it because of my
Pure unabashed devotion to loving you
Who was it that tried to kiss you
Despite a very definite no
And who was it that managed to succeed
(In getting it with your fist down below)
It was me and I'll tell you why
Oh! I did it because of my
Pure unabashed devotion to loving
You and me both feel the same
We even look alike
And like it's a bloomin' shame
That because we do
People think we're you
Know what I mean
Who was it that came to see you
When there was no-one else in sight
And who was it that stayed over an hour
(And not as I'd expected over night)
It was me and I'll tell you why
Oh! I did it because of my
Pure unabashed devotion to loving
Pure unabashed devotion to loving
You, you, you, you
Who was it that caught you fallingEmbed
