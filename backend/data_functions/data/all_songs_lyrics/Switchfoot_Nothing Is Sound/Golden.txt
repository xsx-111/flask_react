Golden Lyrics
(Like freedom in spring)

She's alone tonight with a bitter cup and
She's undone tonight, she's all used up
She's been staring down the demons
Who've been screaming
She's just another so and so
Another so and so

You are golden
You are golden child
You are golden
Don't let go
Don't let go tonight

There's a fear that burns like trash inside
And your shame the curse that burns your eyes
You've been hiding in the bedroom
Hoping this isn't how the story has to go
It's not the way it goes
It's your book now
You are golden
You are golden, Child
You are golden
Don't let go
Don't let go tonight

You're a lonely soul in a land of broken hearts
And far from home is a perfect place to start
(Yeah!)
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

So this final verse is a contradiction
And the more we learn the less we know
We've been talking' about a feeling
We both know inside but couldn't find the words
I couldn't write this verse
I've seldom been so sure
About anything before

Golden
You are Golden, child
You are Golden
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go tonight)
This world is a dead man down (Golden, you are)
Every breath is a fading crown we wear (Golden, Child, you are)
Like some debilitated king (Golden, don't let go)
(Don't let go tonight)
The Earth spins and the moon goes 'round (Golden, you are)
The green comes from the frozen ground (Golden, Child, you are)
And everything will be made new again (Golden)
Like freedom and spring (Golden, Golden)
Hey, like freedom and spring (Golden, you are, hey)
Like freedom and spring (Golden, Child, you are)
(Gold...)Embed
