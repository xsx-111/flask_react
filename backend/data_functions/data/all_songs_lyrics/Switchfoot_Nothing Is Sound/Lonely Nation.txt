Lonely Nation Lyrics
She turns like the ocean
She tells no emotion
She's been gunning down the fight
She's just reminiscing
Blood, sweat, and one thing's missing
She's been breaking up inside, inside

Singing without tongues
Screaming without lungs
I want more than my lonely nation
I want more than my lonely nation
Desperate we are young
Separate we are one
I want more than my desperation
I want more than my lonely nation
Oh, oh

We are the target market
We set the corporate target
We are slaves of what we want
We're just numb and amused
And we're just used to bad news and
We are slaves of what we want
Singing without tongues
Screaming without lungs
I want more than my lonely nation
I want more than my lonely nation
Desperate we are young
Separate we are one
I want more than my desperation
I want more than my lonely nation

Lonely, lonely
Don't leave me hollow
I'm tired
Don't leave me hollow
I'm tired of feeling low
Of feeling hollow
I'm tired of feeling low
Of feeling hollow
I'm tired of feeling low
Of feeling hollow
I'm tired of feeling low
Of feeling hollow
Feeling hollow
Feeling hollow
Singing without tongues
Screaming without lungs
I want more than my desperation
I want more than my lonely nation
Desperate we are young
Separate we are one
I want more than my lonely nation
I want more than my lonely nation
I want more than my lonely nation
I want more than my lonely nationEmbed
