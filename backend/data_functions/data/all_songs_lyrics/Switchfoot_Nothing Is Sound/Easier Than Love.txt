Easier Than Love Lyrics
Sex is currency
She sells cars, she sells magazines
Addictive bittersweet
Clap your hands with the hopeless nicotines

Everyone's a lost romantic
Since our love became a kissing show
Everyone's a Casanova
Come and pass me the mistletoe
Everyone's been scared to death of dying here alone

(She)
It's easier than love, it's easier than life
It's easier to fake and smile and brag
It's easier to leave, it's easier to lie
It's harder to face ourselves at night
Feeling alone, what have we done?
What is the monster we've become?
Where is my soul?

Sex is industry
The CEO of corporate policy
Skin-deep ministry
Suburban youth, hail your so-called liberty
Every advertising antic
Our banner waves with a neon glow
War and love become pedantic
We wage love with a mistletoe
Everyone's been scared to death of dying here alone

(She)
It's easier than love, it's easier than life
It's easier to fake and smile and brag
It's easier to leave, it's easier to lie
It's harder to face ourselves at night
Feeling alone, what have we done?
What is the monster we've become?
Where is my soul?

It's easier than love
It's easier than love
It's easier than love
It's easier than love
She is easier than love
Is easier than love

Everyone's been scared to death of
Everyone's been scared to death of
Everyone's been scared to death of dying here alone
Alone
Sex
It's easier than love, it's easier than life
It's easier to fake and smile and brag
It's easier to leave, it's easier to lie
It's harder to face ourselves at night
Feeling alone, what have we done?
What is the monster we've become?
Where is my soul?
Where is my soul?Embed
