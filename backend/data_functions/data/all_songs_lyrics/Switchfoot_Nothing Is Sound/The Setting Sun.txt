The Setting Sun Lyrics
I've got a wound that doesn't heal
Burning out again
Burning out again
I'm not sure which of me is real
And I'm alone again
Burning out again

My hope runs underneath it all
The day that I'll be home

It won't be long, I belong
Somewhere past the setting sun
Find me free, find me strong
Somewhere back where I belong

They're selling shares of me again
But I'm not buying it
I'm not buying it
My wound goes deeper than the skin
There's no hiding it
So I'm not trying it
My hope runs underneath it all
The day that I'll be home

It won't be long, I belong
Somewhere past the setting sun
Find me free, find me strong
Somewhere back where I belong

Somewhere past the setting sun
Going back where we belong
I'll find you
The setting sun

Let the weak say I am strong, and it won't be long
Let the right say I was wrong, and it won't be wrong
Let us find where we belong
Beyond the setting sun
Beyond the setting sun

It won't be long, I belong
Somewhere past the setting sun
Find me free, find me strong
Somewhere back where I belongEmbed
