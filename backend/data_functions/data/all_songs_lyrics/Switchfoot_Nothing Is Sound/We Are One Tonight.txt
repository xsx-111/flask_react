We Are One Tonight Lyrics
Check, tonight, tonight

I'll rise, I'll fall, I'll fail you all
We built these cities to stand so tall
We've lost our walls

I don't wanna lose it coming down
With the whole world upside down
I don't have a soul to trust in now
With the whole world upside down

We are one, tonight and we're singing it out
We are one, tonight and we're dreaming out loud
And the world is flawed, but these scars will heal
We are one tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Two eyes, one tongue, I've come undone
I'm no victim, I paid these dues
I came to lose

I don't wanna fight about it now
With the whole world upside down
I don't have a soul to trust in now
With the whole world upside down
We are one, tonight and we're singing it out
We are one, tonight and we're dreaming out loud
And the world is flawed, but these scars will heal
We are one, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

I don't wanna lose a common ground
With the whole world upside down
I don't wanna fight about it now
And the world is burning out
Let's slow the evening down, slow it down
Slow down, please slow down, down, down
The stars are comin' out

We are one, we are one, we are one, we are one tonight
We are one tonight and we're singing it out
We are one tonight and we're dreaming out loud
And the world is flawed, but these scars will heal
We are one tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonightEmbed
