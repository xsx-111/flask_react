Daisy Lyrics
Daisy, give yourself away
Look up at the rain
A beautiful display
Of power and surrender
Giving us today
When she gives herself away

Rain, another rainy day
Comes up from the ocean
Give herself away
She comes down easy
On rich and debt the same
When she gives herself away

Let it go
Daisy, let it go
Open up your fists
This fallen world
Doesn't hold your interest
It doesn't hold your soul
Daisy, let it go

Pain, give yourself a name
Call yourself contrition
Avarice or blame
Giving isn't easy
And neither is the rain
When she gives herself away
Daisy, why another day
Why another sunrise
Who will take the blame
For all redemptive motion
And every rainy day
When he gives himself away

Let it go
Daisy, let it go
Open up your fists
This fallen world
It doesn't hold your interest
It doesn't hold your soul
Daisy, let it go
Let it go

Let it go
Let it go
And you let it go go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Go
Let it go
Let it goEmbed
