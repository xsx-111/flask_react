The Fatal Wound Lyrics
I am the crisis
I am the bitter end
I'm gonna gun this town
I am divided
I am the razor edge
There is no easy now

Son of sorrow
Staring down forever
With an aching view
Disenchanted
Let's go down together
With the fatal wound

This is the real thing
No rubber bullets now
This is the final bow
My breath avoids me
My chest is in my head
My stomach's upside-down, down

Son of sorrow
Staring down forever
With an aching view
Disenchanted
Let's go down together
With the fatal wound
With the fatal wound
With the fatal woundEmbed
