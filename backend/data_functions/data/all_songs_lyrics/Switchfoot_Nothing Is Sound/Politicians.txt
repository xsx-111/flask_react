Politicians Lyrics
Everything is broken
Everything is broken
Everything is breaking down, breaking down
Everything is bleeding
Everything is bleeding
Everything is breaking down, breaking down

I pledge allegiance to a country
Without borders, without politicians
Watching for my sky to get torn apart
We are broken, we are bitter
We're the problem, we're the politicians
Watching for our sky to get torn apart
C'mon and break me

Entropy and aching
Where have we been aiming?
Everything is fading out, fading out
We are the faded, splintered, and sedated
Everything is fading out, fading out

I pledge allegiance to a country
Without borders, without politicians
Watching for my sky to get torn apart
We are broken, we are bitter
We're the problem, we're the politicians
Watching for our sky to get torn apart
C'mon and break me
C'mon and break me
I pledge allegiance to a country
Without borders, without politicians (politicians, politicians)
I am broken, I am bitter
I'm the problem, I'm the politician
Watching for my sky to get torn apart
C'mon and break me
C'mon and break meEmbed
