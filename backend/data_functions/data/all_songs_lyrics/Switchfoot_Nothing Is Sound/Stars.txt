Stars Lyrics
Maybe I've been the problem
Maybe I'm the one to blame
But even when I turn it off and blame myself
The outcome feels the same
I've been thinking
Maybe I've been partly cloudy
Maybe I'm the chance of rain
And maybe I'm overcast
Maybe all my luck's washed down the drain

I've been thinking about everyone
Everyone, you look so lonely

But when I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
I see someone else
When I look at the stars, the stars
I feel like myself

Stars looking at a planet
Watching entropy and pain
And maybe start to wonder how the chaos in our lives
Could pass as sane
I've been thinking 'bout the meaning of resistance
Of a world beyond my own
And suddenly the infinite and penitent
Begin to look like home
I've been thinking about everyone
Everyone, you look so empty

But when I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
I see someone else
When I look at the stars, the stars
I feel like myself

Stars, stars
Everyone, everyone you feel so lonely
Everyone, yeah, everyone, you feel so empty

But when I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
I feel like myself
When I look at the stars
The stars
I see someoneEmbed
