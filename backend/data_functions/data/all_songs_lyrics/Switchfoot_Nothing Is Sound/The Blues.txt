The Blues Lyrics
Is this the New Year or just another night?
Is this the new fear or just another fright?
Is this the new tear or just another desperation?

Is this the finger or just another fist?
Is this the Kingdom or just a hit and miss?
I miss direction, most in all this desperation

Is this what they call freedom?
Is this what you call pain?
Is this what they call discontented fame?
It'll be a day like this one
When the world caves in
When the world caves in
When the world caves in

I'm singing this one like a broken piece of glass
For broken hearts and broken noses in the back
Is this the New Year or just another desperation?

You push until you're shoving
You bend until you break
'Til you stand on the broken fields where your fathers lay
It'll be a day like this one
When the world caves in
When the world caves in
When the world caves in
When the world caves in
When the world caves in
When the world caves in

Is nothing here worth saving? Is no one here at all?
Is there any net left that could break our fall?
It'll be a day like this one when the sky falls down
And the hungry and poor and deserted are found

Are you discontented?
Have you been pushing hard?
Have you been throwing down this broken house of cards?
It'll be a day like this one
When the world caves in
When the world caves in
When the world caves in

Is there nothing left now, nothing left to sing?
Are there any left who haven't kissed the enemy?
Is this the New Year or just another desperation?

Does justice ever find you?
Do the wicked never lose?
Is there any honest song to sing besides these blues?
And nothing is okay until the world caves in
Until the world caves in
'Til the world caves in
'Til the world caves in
'Til the world caves in
Until the world caves in
Until the world caves in
Until the world caves in
Until the world caves in
Until the world caves in
Until the world caves inEmbed
