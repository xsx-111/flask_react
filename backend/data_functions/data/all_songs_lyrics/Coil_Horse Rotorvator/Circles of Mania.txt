Circles of Mania Lyrics"Next on stage, children, here's Joey"
Nero's long hot tongue
Nero's long hot tongue licks
This is the sound of the world turning round
The underground
This is the sound of the world turning round
Of the world spinning round
You get eaten alive by the perfect lover
You get eaten alive by the perfect lover
You get eaten alive by the perfect lover
I fell into a burning ring
A burning ring of knives
And the knives slide in
They slide deep into my skin
And they open me so wide
That you stick your head inside
You stick your head inside
You get sewn inside alive
You get eaten alive
You get eaten alive
You get eaten alive
You get eaten alive by the perfect lover
You get eaten alive by the perfect lover
You get eaten alive
When you've swallowed one you just swallow another
When you've swallowed one you just swallow another
To drive away this hunger
You stay in there forever
Caught in the centre of a
Circle of mania
Chemical angel enters arena
Toro d'Or falls to the floor
Falls to the floor
Falls to the floor
And he's fucking the floor, fucking the ground
Fucking the ground
Fucking the ground
The hole in the ground
The hole in the ground
Fucking... fucking... oh God
And hot wires sing deep in my skin
I'm writhing, perspiring like Dutch Schultz at 106 degrees
(Like Dutch Schultz at 106 degrees)
And I wake up licking
I wake up licking the bedsheets clean
Licking and sucking and sucking
And licking and sucking1Embed
