The Anal Staircase LyricsThe angels kiss our souls in bliss
Measure the extent of a dizzying descent
Down the anal staircase
Down the anal staircase
Put just one foot on the staircase
And the next step you're down here on this face
Down the anal staircase
And the rapids of my heart
Will tear your ship of love apart
And we'll end up wrecked
We'll end up at the start
Of the anal staircase
And the angels kiss our souls in bliss
Measure the extent of a dizzying descent
Down the anal staircase
Down the anal staircase
Take a hollowpoint revolver
Right down the rapids of your heart
Blow the fucking thing apart
Blow the fucking thing apart
One step, two step, three step, four step
"Hey! Quit it! Quit it! Get off me, you punk!"
