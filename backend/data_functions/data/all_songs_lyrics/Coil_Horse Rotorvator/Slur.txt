Slur LyricsRoman land of Roman sands and Roman sons
As I watch the sun sink down
On the blood-red edge of the blood-red town
There are shadows for sale
On the edge of town
On the edge of the night
Is a darkness seen
From the side of the night
And the winds blow round this sleeping town
This sleeping town
This Roman land of Roman sands and Roman sons
And it seems to me that when I close my eyes
All the lights in the world
Go out
And the night passes by and you whisper to me
A thousand lies
I stare in surprise
Towards the desert's warm black
And the desert stirs
And the desert stares back
With a thousand eyes
Piercing eyes, ancient eyes
And I ask my lovers, "Do you know
Where the desert roses bloom and grow?"
And I ask my lovers, "Do you know
Where the desert roses bloom and grow?"
And I ask my lovers, "Do you know
Where the desert roses bloom and grow?"3Embed
