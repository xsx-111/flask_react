Penetralia LyricsHello? I'm in...now... Five, four, three, two, one
Follow the black valley, trail of death
Just look at it this way
Into the beautiful sunshine
...I mean, in five years, who cares?
We've made our money
No - what are the satellites for?
Learn to kill, kill from the inside [No, you're breaking up, you're breaking up totally
I know there's somebody else on the line; you gotta hold your own down]
Penetralia, mercenary paraphernalia - sex, sex scenes, funeral, funeral music. Gay
Bar. Submissive dominance. With us, are you with us? Within us
Caught, caught between two cars about to crash. Yeah, okay. In the future you'll

What are you wearing under that?
Something, something, something's coming out of the blue: looks like that kind of
Sex scenes. Fuck the car. Monster car, monster entrails
Pictures...together with women struggling to enter the recesses of my own body
I just think classical, classical horrors. It's going to take boundless bloody hours
Words and pictures
Split second face. Do you hear me?
There's some heavy dark blood on the doctor's hands, and that sledgehammer
Crashes with the killer-boy kisses
Kiss, kiss that kills. I can see something of the car in front. Check it out
In five minutes, okay. Killer-boy kisses. There's just no way...
The diminishing returns, the diminishing returns of a...dream of a horse's head
And a rope of blood cuts them seven times for talking such crap
Unclean flickers. Have you got the pictures? Hello, er, uh... Very well done flavour
Can you bid us up, man? I keep moving and now I, I can't stop... Could you repeat
That please? I couldn't quite understand what you were saying then. But I'm caught
I mean, caught between two cars. Five minutes. Call me. OverEmbed
