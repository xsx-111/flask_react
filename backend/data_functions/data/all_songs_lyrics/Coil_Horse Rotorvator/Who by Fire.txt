Who by Fire LyricsAnd who by fire? Who by water?
Who in the sunshine? Who in the night-time?
Who by high ordeal? Who by common trial?
Who in your merry merry month of May?
Who by very slow decay?
And who shall I say is calling?
And who in her lonely sleep? Who by barbiturate?
Who in these realms of love? Who by something blunt?
Who by avalanche, and who by powder?
Who for his greed, and who for his hunger?
And who shall I say is calling?
And who by brave assent? Who by accident?
Who in solitude, and who in this mirror?
Who by his lady's command? Who by his own hand?
Who in mortal chains? Who in power?
And who shall I say is calling?1Embed
