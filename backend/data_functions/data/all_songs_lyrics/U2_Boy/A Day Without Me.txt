A Day Without Me Lyrics
Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind
I'm dreaming, you're awake
If I was sleeping, what's at stake?

A day without me

Whatever the feelings, I keep feeling
What are the feelings you left behind?


Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind
In the world I left behind
Wipe their eyes and then let go
In the world I left behind
Shed a tear and let love go2Embed
