An Cat Dubh Lyrics
Say goodnight
She waits for me to turn out the light
Really still
She waits to break my will

Woah-oh
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat

And in the daylight
A blackbird makes a violent sight
And when she is done
She sleeps beside the one

Woah-oh
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat

Woah-oh
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat2Embed
