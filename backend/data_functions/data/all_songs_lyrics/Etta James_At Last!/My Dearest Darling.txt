My Dearest Darling Lyrics
All I need
Is someone like you
My dearest darling
Please love me to
Within my heart
I pray your answer's yes
I'll make your life
Full of happiness

I'll be there by your side
Oh
I pledge my love to you
With God as our guide
Unh
My dearest darling
I offer you my heart
Oh, yeah
Whenever you need me
I'll..
I'll be there by your side
Oh
I pledge my love to you
With God as our guide
Oh
Nothing, nothing
Nothing in this world
Can keep us apart
Unh
My dearest darling
I'm offering you my heart
Unh
My dearest darlingEmbed
