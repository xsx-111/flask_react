All I Could Do Was Cry Lyrics
I heard church bells ringing
I heard a choir singing
I saw my love walk down the aisle
On her finger, he placed a ring
Ohh-oh

I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man
I heard them promise
"Till death do us part"
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart

All I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)

And now the wedding is over
Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads
For them, life has just begun
But mine is ending
Ohh
All I could do, all I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)2Embed
