Broken Heart Lyrics

Tchurup, tchu tchu
Tchu, tchu, tchuru
Tchurup, tchu, tchuruchu
Tchurup, tchu, tchuruchu
I did it for you, darling
I did for you, my darling
But you never know
That my heart beats a little louder
Every time that you're near
My heart beats a little louder
Even broken broken heart and soul
Broken heart, desire
Tchurup, tchu tchu
Tchu, tchu, tchuru
Tchurup, tchu, tchuruchu
Tchurup, tchu, tchuruchu
I did it for you, darling
I did for you, my darling
But you never know
That my heart beats a little louder
Every time that you're near
My heart beats a little louder
Even broken broken heart and soul
Broken heart, desireEmbed
