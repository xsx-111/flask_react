The Back Seat of My Car (Original Mix) Lyrics
I don't care to be scared
When I drive my haunted car
Ghost red hot tonight
My gaze in the rearview mirror

'Cause I see the backseat of my car
Yes, I see the backseat of my car
Oh, I see the backseat of my car
Oh, I see the backseat of my car

Shopping bags falling down
Apples roll, magazine crumpled
In the heat of night
Milk leaks, sucked up by the velvet

And I see the backseat of my car
Yes, I see the backseat of my car
Oh, I see the backseat of my car
Oh, I see the backseat of my car

You want a lift?
Hop in the back
How far do you want to go?
All the way?
Ok
The backseat of my car
Yes, I see the backseat of my car
Oh, I see the backseat of my car
Yes, I see the backseat of my car
And I see the backseat of my car
Yes, I see the backseat of my car
Oh, I see the backseat of my car
Oh, I see the backseat of my carEmbed
