Who Is She? Lyrics
This is the tale of a man
Haunted by an image from his past
The face of a woman
Transformed by obsession
Into that of a phantom

Oh, who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face
Is she a lost embrace?

Am I in love with just a theme?
Or is Ayesha just a dream?
A mystery
Oh, who is she?

Oh, who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face
Is she a lost embrace?

I call her name
Across an endless plain
She'll answer me
Where ever she may be

Oh, who is she? (Oh, who is she?)
A misty memory (A misty memory)
A haunting face (A haunting face)
Is she a lost embrace?

Somewhere across the sea of time
A love immortal such as mine
Will come to me
Eternally

Immortal she
Return to me5Embed
