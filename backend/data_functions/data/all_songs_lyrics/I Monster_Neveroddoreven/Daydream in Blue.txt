Daydream in Blue Lyrics
Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

I dream a dirty dream of you, baby
You're crawling on the bathroom floor
You float around the room and you're naked
Then you're flying out the bedroom door

I dream a dirty dream
I dream a dirty dream

Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day
I dream a dirty dream of you, baby
You're swinging from the chandelier
I'm climbing up the walls cause I want you
But when I reach you, you disappear

I dream a dirty dream
I dream a dirty dream

I daydream
I daydream
I daydream
(Dream)

Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day
Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
(I dirty) Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day
(Dream, dream)
(Dream, dream)
