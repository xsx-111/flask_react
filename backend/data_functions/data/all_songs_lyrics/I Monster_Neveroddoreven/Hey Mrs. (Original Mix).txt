Hey Mrs. (Original Mix) Lyrics
Ah, look at you
Ah, look at you
Ah, look at you
Ah, look at you

Hey Mrs. Grey, are you awake yet?
Your beauty sleep is just a dream
Those lines on your face
They tell your story
So now it's time for laser beams

Ah, look at you
A thousand miles above the ground
You're not coming down
Ah, what a view
You drift about, you're spinning 'round
You're not coming down

Hey Mr. Blue, you feeling randy?
Do you still flirt with her next door?
Wearing that dress
Nicked from your mother
It doesn't fit you anymore
Ah, look at you
A thousand miles above the ground
You're not coming down
Ah, what a view
You drift about, you're spinning 'round
You're not coming down

Hey Mrs. Green
Who's that you're out with?
He's twenty-five, but not your son
Show him your bits
It's what you're there for
This woman's weak, it keeps him young

Ah, look at you
A thousand miles above the ground
You're not coming down
Ah, what a view
You drift about, you're spinning 'round
You're not coming down

You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming down
You're not coming downEmbed
