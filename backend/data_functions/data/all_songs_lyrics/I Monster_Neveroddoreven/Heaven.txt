Heaven Lyrics
I look at you
And before my eyes it's true
That the girl of my dreams
Is not quite what she seems?
Open your door
Turn on the light
Show me some more
Tell me it's alright

Heaven
Is inside you
Heaven
When I ride you
Heaven
Do you want me?
Is heaven just in my mind?

I look at you
At everything you do
The words in your hand
Still remain unsaid
Open my eyes
Inflatable girl
Lose the disguise
Release me from your spell
Heaven
Is inside you
Heaven
When I ride you
Heaven
Do you want me?
Is heaven just in my mind?
Heaven
Is inside you
Heaven
When I ride you
Heaven
Do you want me?
Is heaven just in my mind?Embed
