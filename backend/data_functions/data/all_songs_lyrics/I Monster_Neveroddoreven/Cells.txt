Cells Lyrics
Look at the cells
Watch them grow
Dividing so fast
How much do they know?

It's just a little piece of me and you
It's easy
Just a little piece of me in you
It's easy

DNA do not alter
Building your son or daughter

It's just a little piece of me and you
It's easy
Just a little piece of me in you
It's easy

Look at the cells
Taking form
Amphibian child
You have born
It's just a little piece of me and you
It's easy
Just a little piece of me in you
It's easy

Hands, heart, brain, eyes that will see
Infinite complexity

It's just a little piece of me and you
It's easy
Just a little piece of me in you
It's easyEmbed
