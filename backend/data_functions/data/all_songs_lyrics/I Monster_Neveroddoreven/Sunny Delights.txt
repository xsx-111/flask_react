Sunny Delights Lyrics
Ooh baby
Soaking in the sun
Hot lady
You've only just begun
Are you melting into nothing?
Who will soothe your tender skin tonight?

Sunshine
Girl on the beach
Sunshine
All lipstick and bleach
Sunshine
Oil on her skin
Sunshine
Such a wonderful thing

Ooh baby
Goddess of the heat
Hot lady
Ultraviolet sweet
Are you shaking?
Dehydrating
I'll caress away the day with you
Sunshine
Girl on the beach
Sunshine
All lipstick and bleach
Sunshine
Oil on her skin
Sunshine
Such a wonderful thingEmbed
