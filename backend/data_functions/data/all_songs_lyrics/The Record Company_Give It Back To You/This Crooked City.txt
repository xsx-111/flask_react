This Crooked City Lyrics
If you need some money
I swear I’ll steal millions
And take care of you, my darlin’
Ho, ho
Ooh
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ooh
Ho, ho
Ooh
Ho, ho
Ah
Ho

My eyes are bloodshot
She blushed
Yes, she cared about everything
Wrong
She took out money
And counted it
If God exists
(Ooh)
It’ll be alright
Then we shared a couple
Of tears
And we’re here today
To roll
Outta here
On the second date
(Ah)
The sun was handed down
Sunset like Halloween lights
Over this crooked city
If you need some money
I swear I’ll steal millions
And take care of you, my darlin’
If you need some money
I swear I’ll steal millions
And take care of you, my darlin’
Ho, ho
Ooh
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ooh
Ho, ho
Ooh
Ho, ho
Ah
Look, baby
Yeah

Left the dust cloud behind us
Helpless in the dark
I love the black and blue confusion
On the shoulders of a hustler
A joke, these narrow streets
My baby took off with wings
She grew horns to clear a pathway
Ooh
Baby, if ya need money
Ah
I swear, I’ll steal millions
Ooh
And I’ll take care of you, darlin’
Look out
If you need some money
I swear I’ll steal millions
And take care of you, my darlin’
If you need some money
I swear I’ll steal millions
Lord, baby, I’ll take care of you, my darlin’
Believe me, woman
If you need some money
Ooh
I swear I’ll steal millions
Ooh
I will take care of you, darlin’
Ooh
If you need some money
Ooh
I swear I’ll steal millions
Ooh
And take care of you, darlin’Embed
