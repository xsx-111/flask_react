Rita Mae Young Lyrics
Good morning, Rita, don't you miss your wine?
Don't you miss your body being next to mine?
Got a hollow heart and I'm feeling wrong
Got a dollar in my pocket for a midnight song

When your lover's gone and the music's over
Oh no, don't wanna be alone any more
When your lover's gone, can't rest at night
Threading through the crowd in a low-tavern light

Yeah, she's gone, yeah, she's gone
My Rita was a light in my bright shining morning
Yeah, she's gone, yeah, she's gone
My Rita Mae Young

Good morning, Rita, hope you're doing right
I couldn't give you what you wanted, but you stayed on my mind
Got a tired heart, and it's been too long
Put a dollar in the jukebox for a midnight song
When your lover is gone, there's cloud in your eyes
It might be the bourbon, all the lies that you hide
When the evenings done, that feels warm
The soft southern air and a jukebox morning

My blue-eyed woman
Oh, she's gone
My blue-eyed woman


(Long gone, child
Come back, woman
Come back, woman)1Embed
