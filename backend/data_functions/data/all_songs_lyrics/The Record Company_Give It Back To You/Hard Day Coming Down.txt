Hard Day Coming Down LyricsA hard day coming down
Got back late and I was all alone
Opened up my door ain’t nobody home
There’s a few things of mine laying around
It’s a hard day coming down
The dog done left and took his bone
No dial tone 'cause there ain’t no phone
This big mess got so overblown
It’s a hard day coming down
Well I once was the king now I’m overthrown
I’m out in the world trying to hold my own
I’ve got no pillow to cry upon
It’s a hard day coming down
Now I ain’t one to throw no stones
Not yet a man but I’m fully grown
The bank won’t give me that personal loan
It’s a hard day coming home
I always told you I’d be better known
Else I’d be walking down the company road
Got no skills but this baritone
It’s a hard day coming home
I once was the king now I’m overthrown
I’m out in the world trying to hold my own
I’ve got no pillow to cry upon
It’s a hard day coming downEmbed
