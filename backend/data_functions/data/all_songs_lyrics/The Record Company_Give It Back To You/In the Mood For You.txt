In the Mood For You Lyrics
I’m in a mood for ya, baby
I’m in a mood right now
Come on, come on, baby
Come on, right now

It’s been awhile since
I’ve seen ya around
Too many nights alone
Got no reason to be with me now
I know I did ya wrong
No, I wasn’t such a good man
Not like the one ya got now
He treats ya nice
Does everything right
Well, can he make ya howl, yeah?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

You in the mood for me, baby?
You in the mood right now?
Come on, come on, sugar
You in the mood right now?
Been awhile since I seen ya around
Do ya feel alone?
Think there’s a reason to be with me now
Well, I’m goin’ tell you that you’re wrong
Too good for me, baby
But if ya come back somehow
I’ll treat ya nice
Make everything right
I’m gonna make ya howl
