On the Move LyricsShe’s got me on the move
She’s got me on the move
Oh the woman’s oh so cruel
And she’s got me on the move
She’s got me ignoring the traffic lights 'cause they look so stale and lifeless
I swear I’d swim to Paris to get her if I hadn’t booked the flight yet
She’s got me wearing snow shoes It’s cold being on her trail
Ain’t nothing can shake the thought from my brain of the way she makes me scream and yell
She’s got me on the move
She’s got me on the move
Oh and the woman’s oh so cruel
And she’s got me on the move
She’s phenomenally plastic and has a way to call out your passion
She’ll break into your home, redecorate, then escape to leave you there alone
Clean as the rain passing over but her eyes fill up with gold
Never going to love no one long enough to find herself a widow
She’s got me on the move
She’s got me on the move
Oh the woman’s oh so cruel
And she’s got me on the move, that’s right
Baby everything’s getting dangerous
When you’re going faster and faster
She comes home from the bar after dark
And ain’t a man born that can catch her
She’ll leave you slain lying in your ashes
From burning up cash and happiness
She looks like a bonfire in city light
There is no antidote for this disaster
She’s got me on the move
She’s got me on the move
She’s got me on the move oh baby
You got me on the move
And you’re way too cruel
You’ve got me on the move
Oh baby don’t be so cruelEmbed
