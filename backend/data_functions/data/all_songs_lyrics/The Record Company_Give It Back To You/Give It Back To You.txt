Give It Back To You Lyrics
Well, I chased the sun
To California
I chased the sunset
To California
And I did it, did it, did it, did it, baby
Had nothin’ better to do
I chased the sun to California
Whoa, alright
I’m gonna get it and give it back
Oh, Lord, baptize me
In the ocean water
Please baptize me
In the cold ocean water
I needed, needed, needed, needed, babe
Do what I needed to do
Now baptize me
In cold ocean water
That’s right

I’m gonna get it and give it back
Yeah
I’m gonna get it and give it back
Get it, get it, get it, get it, baby
I’ll give it back to you
I’ll get it, get it, get it, get it, baby
And give it back to you, yeah
Whew, ooh

Yeah
And ya only get one ride
One ticket, one time
Your life your life
And it don’t last long
Wait a minute
Days gone by
Maybe one too many
Days gone by
So I’ll take the ride
That is why I
Mmm, oh yeah
I chased the sun
To California
Now please baptize me
In the cold ocean water
Will it, will it, will it, will it, baby
Do what I need it to do
I chased the sun to California
California

Get it, get it, get it, get it, baby
Give it back to you
I’m gonna get it, get it, get it, get it, baby
I’ll give it back to you
Ooh

Get it, get it, get it, get it, baby
I’m gonna give it back to you
Ooh

You only get one ride
One ticket, one time
Yeah, I wanna, I wanna get it
Give it back
Yeah, and give it back
To youEmbed
