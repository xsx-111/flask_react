Feels So Good Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey
I don’t wanna do right today
Hey, hey, hey
I ain’t lookin’ for love
Hey, hey, hey
I don’t wanna do right today
Hey, hey, hey
I’m tired of bein’ stunned
Got somethin’ that I can’t control
(Can’t control, can’t control)
I got your taste on my lips and I want some more
(Want some more, want some more)

Oh, come on
Hey, hey
Feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good doin’ what you want
When you know that you shouldn’t
Hey, hey
It feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good doin’ what you want
When you know that you shouldn’t
Hey, hey, hey
Turn on the green light, babe
Hey, hey, hey
Yeah, turn on the green light, babe
Yeah
Got somethin’ that I can’t control
(Can’t control, can’t control)
I got your taste on my lips and I want some more
(Want some more, want some more)

Oh, come on
Hey, hey
Feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good doin’ what you want
When you know that you shouldn’t
Hey, hey
It feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good doin’ what you want
When you know that you shouldn’t
Come on, babe
Hey, hey
Uh huh
Hey, hey
Uh huh
Feels so good
Hey, it’s alright
Whew

Hold me in your arms one time
Hold me in your arms one time
Hold me in your arms, yeah

Hey, hey
Feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good doin’ what you want
When you know that you shouldn’t
Hey, hey
It feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good doin’ what you want
When you know that you shouldn’t
Doin’ what you want when you know that you shouldn’t
Doin’ what you want when you know that you shouldn’t

Hey, hey
Feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good
Hey, hey
It feels so good doin’ what you want
