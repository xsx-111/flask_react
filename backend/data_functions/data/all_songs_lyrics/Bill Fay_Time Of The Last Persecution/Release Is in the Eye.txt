Release Is in the Eye Lyrics
Love is in the kitchen
Release is in the eye
I'm coming around to get you
Though I cannot say what time
Vacating the chair
‘Cos I've had my share

Christ is in the bathroom
Look in any mirror on the wall
And Satan's in the garden shed
He'd like to screw you all
Vacating the chair
‘Cos I've had my share

Moon is over the water
Business is on the boom
The clouds are in the thousand mountains
Asylum Street grows
Vacating the chair
‘Cos I've had my share
