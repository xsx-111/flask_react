Come A Day LyricsThere will come a day
There will come a day
Nations will not prevail
No nation will prevail
The lanes where you used to walk
Covered in leaves
The fields where you used to lay
Now covered in battle dress
But there come a day
There will come a day
Nations will not prevail
No nation will prevailEmbed
