Plan D LyricsWell now soon plan D
Will be released and the sea shall rise
And the skies open
And can't you see you're in on it?
You were born though you need not
Have been born here at all
And is that not some cause
For worship, being born among these trees?
Though the beast is lurking
Well Saint George he tried
Where he failed the sky will succeed
Shall be seen the hornets
Are you there to build a spire that blocks out the sky?
Your doors are open but are your minds?
Get down
And if you're sane yes I'm mad him good him bad
My knees are not bleeding from kneeling
In death's cathedral
Well now soon plan D
Will be released and the sea shall rise
And the skies openEmbed
