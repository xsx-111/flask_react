Dust Filled Room LyricsShe sat smoking a cigarette
The fire on her legs
In the dust filled room she wished that the cigarette could last forever
But the fire died down and the cigarette burned out
And the room grew dark and she got up
And went out to see once again what it was that was outside
Oh I know that chair I've sat there
As one goes out another one sits down
In the dust filled room they wish that the cigarette could last foreverEmbed
