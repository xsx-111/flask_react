Let All The Other Teddies Know LyricsTeddy, don't let the shadows get me
And be ready, Teddy for when the cupboard explodes
And don't cry Teddy for there's someone to turn to
And Teddy, let all the other teddies know
The only time I'm not tired is when I'm asleep
Everywhere there are angels but we never meet
Teddy, don't let the shadows get me
And be ready, Teddy for when the cupboard explodesEmbed
