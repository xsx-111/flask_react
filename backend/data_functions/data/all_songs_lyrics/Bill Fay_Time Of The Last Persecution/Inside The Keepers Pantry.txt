Inside The Keepers Pantry LyricsInside the keeper's pantry
Spied an air hole and got away
Outside a horse was standing
And though the night was dark I rode away
I arrived in time to see the harbour sailing away
No, no, no you never left me
Back in the keeper's pantry
Now I know where I belong among the houseflies
But still I think of outside
Where all the pain was, where all the pain was
I arrived in time to see the harbour sailing away
No, no, no you never left me
No, no, no you never left me
No, no, no you never left me
No, no, no you never left me
No, no, no you never left me
No, no, no you never left meEmbed
