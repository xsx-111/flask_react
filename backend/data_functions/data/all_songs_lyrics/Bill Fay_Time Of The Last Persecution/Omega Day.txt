Omega Day Lyrics
Inside a bar
Of a sleeping town
There lay a sleeping man
He wore a frown
A stranger woke him
He looked around
Then he spoke
I wrote it down

He said, “My climbing rope is broken
And I cannot stay awake
Better fix it, son
No joking
For the Omega Day is come”

I went over
To the stranger's side
I began to speak
But he read my mind
He said, “You know me from long ago”
Then he turned
I watched him go

Aahh
AahhEmbed
