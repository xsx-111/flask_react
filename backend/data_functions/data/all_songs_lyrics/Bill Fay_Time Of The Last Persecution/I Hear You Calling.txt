I Hear You Calling Lyrics
I hear you calling
From the riverbank
I will be coming
When the air is black

All my time is lying
On the factory floor
And all my time is lying
On the factory floor

Some say messiah coming
Got to get it right
Some say messiah coming
Give me back my time
All my time is lying
On the factory floor
And all my time is lying
On the factory floor

I hear you calling
I hear you calling
I hear you callingEmbed
