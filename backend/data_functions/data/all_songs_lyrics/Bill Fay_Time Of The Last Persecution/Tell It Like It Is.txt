Tell It Like It Is LyricsPeace be in your breath and in your sighing
Peace be in your jack and in your blade
And peace be in your Sunday picnic
And your old school friends who've passed away
But tell it like it is
Tell it like it is
Tell it like it is
Peace be in your sight and in your seeing
Peace be in their bikes and in their door keys
And peace be in your team losing
And in your dustbin that blew away
But tell it like it is
Tell it like it is
Tell it like it isEmbed
