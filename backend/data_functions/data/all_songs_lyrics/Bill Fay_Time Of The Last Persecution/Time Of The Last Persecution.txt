Time Of The Last Persecution LyricsI must stand by the side of the mountain
I must be where I know I must be
When you stand and face the gas masks and truncheons
You must know what it all really means
It is the time of the last persecution
And Caesar shall be raised
He will ask for his feet to be kissed by your sister
And your children will fear at his name
Do not avenge these deaths do not avenge them
You must know what it all really means
It is the time of the Anti-Christ know what I say
Make for your own secret place
And others will join you there
And you wait for the ships in the air
And you wait for a sign like a trumpet sounding
And you go out and walk to the Christ
And you go out and walk to the ChristEmbed
