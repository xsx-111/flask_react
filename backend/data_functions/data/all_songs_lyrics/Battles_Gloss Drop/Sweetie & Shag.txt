Sweetie & Shag LyricsWhen the hurt is let in
All the girls I feel 'em darken
For there is that girl I'm lovin'
But they rip too wide for jumping
Life of boy where do you sleep?
There's the girl where do you go?
Life of boy what do you see?
What do you know, what do you know?
Why should I be a fantasy?
Don't nobody know no one else is
Why would I be like a child they found dead again?
When the hurt is laying low
All the girls I feel enduring
For there is the girls are laughing
But they rip too wide for jumping
Life of boy where do you sleep?
There's the girl what do you see?
Life of boy how much do you know?
What do you know, what do you know?
Why should I be a fantasy?
Don't nobody know no one else is
Why would I be like a child they found dead again?Embed
