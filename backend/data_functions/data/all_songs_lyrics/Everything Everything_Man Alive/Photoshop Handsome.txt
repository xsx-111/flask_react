Photoshop Handsome Lyrics
I will gain an extra life
When I get the high score
(You can re-spawn anywhere)
I am one with the furniture
More inanimate than amateur
(Like a television set)
Gangrene knuckle announced so audibly
I will boost my attention span
Soon, my clock will have a minute hand
(You've become a smithereen)
I'm watching that foxhound frolic on the abattoir floor
Up in heaven, it's symmetrical, oh

Airbrush! What have you done with my father?
Why does he look like a carving?
I don't wanna live in the present
I make my own density
And ah-ah-ah! Who did your Photoshop handsome?
You ready for reincarnation?
Gotta come back as something organic
Or come back as something else
Just come back as something else
More dollar, less scholar, less time
My teeth dazzle like an igloo wall
I inhabit, I inhibit y'all
(Can you operate alone?)
Chest pumped elegantly elephantine
Southern hemisphere by Calvin Klein
(Watch your dorsal fin collapse)
But I know nothing about my history
I put a rainforest in an Oxo cube
Struck by lightning if I take the tube
(Thank your chromosomes for that)
Eh! I have skin like a waxen peel
And a face that I can never feel, but

Airbrush! What have you done with my landscape?
Flooding the fields with this clone shape?
Where is the country you died for?
And what is the century?
And ah-ah-ah! Who did your Photoshop handsome?
You ready for reincarnation?
Gotta come back as something less frantic
Or banish that army of panic
Or come back as something organic
Just come back as something organic
Just come back as something organic
Come back as something organic
Just come back as something organic
Come back as something organic
Or come back as something else
I will gain an extra life
I will gain an extra life
I will gain an extra life
I will gain an extra

Airbrush! What have you done with my father?
Why does he look like a carving?
I don't wanna live in the present
I make my own density
And ah-ah-ah! Who did your Photoshop handsome?
You ready for reincarnation?
Gotta come back as something organic
Or come back as something else7Embed
