NASA Is on Your Side Lyrics
I awake in the future, I have turned to stone with fear
Laid on petrified trees
In a high school massacre, I'm fossilised and clear
The teenage terrorists freeze
We began dismantling the stadia and schools
Singing, "Save our simian souls"
Polished up warm bullets hanging static in the air
Droplets glittering home

NASA knows how the pheromones
Cascade down the walls
You can't help the way you feel
You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil
Yeah, they're gonna dig a coal-face out of you
Isambard, I'm all steel

Chasing homeless cheerleaders through the sewers lit
By burning polythene bags
Pushing flame scorched limos to the oil rig tonight
For the promenade dance

Fill your locker with an arsenal
Hieroglyphic every particle
Mother all about the coal
And the lava and the gas that we are
Lovers on the landfill, digging me up
To fuel rockets and risk (Save us)
Look across now, honey, the horizon
I can see a shuttle birth, is it a boy? Or a girl? Or a gun?
I know it's ludicrous to be lost
There's never been a time like this
Everyone is gonna end up there
You're overcome
But NASA is on your side
And it's happening, the sky is shattering
And they're gonna make a Death Star out of you
But NASA is on your side
Yeah, NASA is on your side
Yeah, NASA is on your side
NASA is on your side
NASA is on your side

And everyone is gonna end up there
You're overcome
But NASA is on your side
Yeah, NASA is on your side
Yeah, NASA is on your side

There were children climbing over fridges in the rush
To see the death of the sun
And we laughed all night when they said, "Treasure in the sky"
And we had nothing but funEmbed
