Suffragette Suffragette Lyrics
Blitz
You test me no more
I'm calm, now absent
I'm date-rape yellow, black to the liver, come on
Take my lung, take my loose tongue
Take my sum, take my memory
Of nothing at all, nothing at all
Is what you remind me
No thread, no lips, no postscripts
No eclipse of my liberty
Oh, pedigree chum, pedigree chum
I'm never your father

Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there?


More
My arc light, my knees
When she casts off
Her clothes, I don't know what is reality
And my death throes, this indefinite pose
Her flesh codes inconceivable
Oh, suffragette, suffragette
I wanna be outlawed and AWOL
No alphabet can be used yet
No cassette is available
Oh, I dunno how, I dunno how
I'm gonna reset my whole radar
Forget (Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone?)
Forget (Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there?)


Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there?

Taken back and take it back
Of nothing at all, nothing at all
Is what you remind me
And the ball's in your court
In the court, your ball
Oh suffragette, suffragette
I wanna be outlawed and AWOL, but

Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there?4Embed
