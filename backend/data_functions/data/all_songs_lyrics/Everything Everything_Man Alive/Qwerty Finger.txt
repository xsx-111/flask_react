Qwerty Finger Lyrics
We slide in from the epoch of Anglo-American wire
And a Saxon spire
Glint in the glare far above me
Put pressure on it!
She collapse me
Man alive, her every ache a baton to me
Age of ending!
Where's the worth in proving I was here?
But maybe Qwerty can leave some little evidence while he lives
When they be lying in rows, they can't believe that it's happening
And Qwerty Finger replies, "I don't know how to sleep, knowing this"
I can't go down like the rest, oh, Qwerty, take it away
(If it's gonna happen to him)

So how will they remember us whole when we turn into salt?
And it's mine, the fault
Mine the dream and the vein, home of whale flesh
Make soap out of it!
I regret so
Every wand I splinter in a fit of frenzy
Distant memory
She don't care for leaving anything behind
But maybe Qwerty can leave some little evidence while he lives
When be lying in rows, they can't believe that it's happening
And Qwerty Finger replies, "I don't know how to sleep knowing this"
I can't go down like the rest, oh, Qwerty, take it away
(If it's gonna happen to him)

I can't let you turn yourself off
Off, ooh
Your every ounce an element sleeping
A part of you just never quite receiving
I wanna be the one to get in, ah-ah!
But the only way you tell me you're certain
To draw asunder every leper curtain
Would be a hail of every flower to ash, ah-ah!
And when every attosecond means nothing
And all that you believe in isn't working
I can't begin to tell you I know, ah-ah!
And in twenty-thousand years they trawl the seaboard
But all that's washing up there is a keyboard
Yeah, they piece it all together from that, ah-ah!
Come on, child
What you say, what you do, yeah, it's all over now
Qwerty Finger no more
Qwerty Finger no more
I can't do what you ask me
Qwerty Finger no more, no more
She collapse me
Man alive, her every ache a baton to me
Age of ending
Where's the worth in proving I was here?1Embed
