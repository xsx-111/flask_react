Come Alive Diana Lyrics
Come alive, Diana
I don't have time to dig a grave
But I know it's the only option left to me
Now summer has sucked the stone and burst your tyres
On the shore, you found him
Warped and wild were his eyes
And they shook and they quivered in their sockets
Like a bullet, they ricocheted between your thighs

Her phantom head is thinking for all mankind
I saw her portrait in the Mail
Her phantom head was directing the holiest of hunts
I made mistakes
I lost an author, ooh, and then I lost a daughter's awe
I don't know how you'd affect it more
Her phantom head, her phantom head
Her phantom head, her phantom head

Line the streets, Diana
With armoured cars, oh, column inch, timeless inch
Can you inch another centimetre closer to hearts and minds?
You'll win them yet
And the young Diana
She waves inside a global grief
In a wind, gonna Praia, gonna Luz her
And the patterns emerge like germs, lest we forget
(He told me, he told me)
Her phantom head is thinking for all mankind
I saw her portrait in the Mail
Her phantom head was directing the holiest of hunts
I made mistakes
I lost an author, ooh, and then I lost a daughter's awe
I don't know how you'd affect it more

They're ringing and ringing the Liberty Bell
And I can feel the heat, I can hear the heat rising for
That Aryan, Aryan, Aryan knell
And mother looks away, father looks away for a second
(Is rolling around some yard while simultaneously wired)

Her phantom head is thinking for all mankind
I saw her portrait in the Mail
Her phantom head was directing the holiest of hunts
I made mistakes
I lost an author, ooh, and then I lost a daughter's awe
I don't know how you'd affect it more
Her phantom head, her phantom head
Her phantom head, her phantom head

They're ringing and ringing the Liberty Bell
That Aryan, Aryan, Aryan knell
They're ringing and ringing the Liberty BellEmbed
