Pablo and Andrea LyricsShow me where you keep all your secrets upstairs
Night after night you sleep while they're setting off flares
Someone came and took all the roses away
No use in showing me tears if you want me to stay
'Cause down the street all the meters have run out of time
Run out of time
I waited for you as the trees swayed out of time
In a crowded room I pick up your lonely stare
I'll cover for you like a slipcover covers a chair
But someone came and took all the roses away
It was only 5 minutes, it felt like it stretched into a day
Someone came and took all the roses away
Someone came and took all the roses away
Someone came and took all the roses away1Embed
