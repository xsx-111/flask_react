The Ballad of Red Buckets LyricsI wonder what's on your mind
I wonder what's on your mind
Look around and see
What it does to me
I wonder what's on your mind
I think I'll throw it all away
I think I'll throw it all away
And if dreams come back to me
I'll pretend that I don't see
I'll just cover my eyes instead
It'll surely come
It'll surely come
Here it comes again2Embed
