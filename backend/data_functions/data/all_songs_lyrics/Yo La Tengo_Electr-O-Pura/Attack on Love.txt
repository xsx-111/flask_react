Attack on Love LyricsThere is a group of young Chinese
Who love music as their manner of expression
They find love in adversity and dedication
They represent dramatic, living love
Let's go change, you hokey little runt who wanted to dance
Maybe fifteen years old, maybe sixteen years old
She says, "Hey man, you all suck!"
So I get on up there, put her on her little ass with my honky stuff With this attack on love
A little later on, it don't matter when
I get up back on the dance floor again
I say, "Hey, baby, what's your name? What's your name?
What bothers you today?
Are you ready for a little something to do?"Embed
