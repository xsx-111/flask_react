Decora Lyrics
I see you crawling across the floor
Never see you standing anymore
You take whatever's put in your hand
You ask for more until you can't

Decora
Decora
Decora
Decora

It's not the first time you'll take a fall
Act like you've never seen double before
We tie deep into the past
Take this chance with me 'cause it's the last
