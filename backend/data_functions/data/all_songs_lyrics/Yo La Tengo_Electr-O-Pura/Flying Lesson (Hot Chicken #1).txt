Flying Lesson (Hot Chicken #1) LyricsEyes go places that you can't see
It's not that easy to hide from me
I hear the whispers everywhere I go
I hear the laughter everywhere I go
3 AM with the TV on
4 AM, TV on
The nervous ticking of my heart
Restlessness when we're apart
Think about the last thing that we said
Again and again it runs through my head
And I hear footsteps that aren't yours
They sound like yours, but they all do
Not much left for me to pray
Why sleep or dream when I'm awake
My eyes in places you forgot to look
My eyes in places you forgot to lookEmbed
