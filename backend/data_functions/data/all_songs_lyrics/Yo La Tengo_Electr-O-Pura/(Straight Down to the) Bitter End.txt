(Straight Down to the) Bitter End LyricsPeople say that once you dyed your hair
You started showing up everywhere
Well you're standing tall, and you've got nothing at all
So you grab at everything you see
Now the world keeps spinning when you die
While the lights keep flashing in the sky
They'll be sighing after normal sights
Drags up baggage, pretend to read
Demand the pages that you'll never redo
Sun sets down on your skittish heart
Cedar mile, how it's coming apart
Now the world keeps spinning when you die
While the lights keep flashing in the sky
They'll be sighing after normal fights
Pickled eels, lemon peels
Hired hand picks you something new
Rainbow nights, stunning whites
Stars that shine but don't belong to you
The passive fools by the swimming pool
You'll fit right in with their pathetic grins
Stunning tricks, bottomless pits
You remind me where I don't want to be
While the lights keep flashing in the sky
They'll be sighing after normal sights
Now the world keeps spinning when you die1Embed
