Paul Is Dead LyricsWalking on 10th Street
The guy in front of me, Walkman, headphones on, Stones cranked
The thing that caught my ear, singing loud and clear
Well every couple of steps I heard "Woo-woo"
And he said it so un-self-consciously
That never it would occur to me that
He revealed himself
And I'd offer a blue
I was drunk the night we met, I might try to forget
Except I know so were you
I don't really care, cause we went on from there
And I try not to hide from what is true
The other night I had this dream
You told me what you want from me
I gave it to you instantly
And I woke up without a clueEmbed
