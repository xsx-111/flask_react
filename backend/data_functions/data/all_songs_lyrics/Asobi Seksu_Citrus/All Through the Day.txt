All Through the Day LyricsAll through the day, I dream about the night
I dream about the night here with you
All through the day, I wish away the time
Until the time when I'm here with you
Down falls the sun, I run to meet you
The evening mist melts away
Down smiles the moon, and soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of, all through the day
All through the day, I wish away the time
Until the time when I'm here with you
Down falls the sun, I run to meet you
The evening mist melts away
And down smiles the moon, and soon your lips recallEmbed
