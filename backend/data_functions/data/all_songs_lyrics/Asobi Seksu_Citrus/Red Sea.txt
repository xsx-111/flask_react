Red Sea LyricsFourteen quiet days
These hours just slept in your place
White sand and a vague
Sense of youth
How can I get through?
It's a violent truth
That I'm like you
Sixteen lonely hours
No sun or depth
Fifteen dreams of you all alone
But still far from reach
Crosses traced in white sand
It's a violent truth
That I'm like you
You said the first time was so perfect
But the rest was all just wrong
You said there's too many gone too longEmbed
