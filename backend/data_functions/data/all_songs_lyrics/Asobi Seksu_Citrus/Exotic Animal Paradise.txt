Exotic Animal Paradise LyricsYou say you'll move on
You better not be lying
All the things you find out
I just find tiring
Our TV's blasting
Our words dividing
Like little kids now
With faces hiding
I don't know what to say
Cause we don't have the words
We'll throw it out it's empty
We don't have the words
If there's a reason
For all this crying
You let me know
While you're decidingEmbed
