Nefi + Girly LyricsTeach me to learn to lose myself
My finger was pricked by someone else
Pull my blood up through a mixer straw
Spread the words all wrong on the neighbor's lawn and on
Don't cry for sleeping kittens
'Cause they won't die today
We'll cover them with flowers
They dream their dreams away
Disconnect the feeling factory
Put your tongue up to my battery
Things are so much smoother when we lie
Crush your cigarettes out on an orange sky, and try
Lose sleep for sleeping, children
But throw your branch away
The bees they buzzed so loudly
That I just couldn't stay
I just couldn't stay
Awaiting an audience
Awaiting an audience
Awaiting an audience
Awaiting an audience

Trace the feel of everything you steal
Tell me which is paper and which is real
We won't answer even when they call
When we're hiding from shadows that are dancing on the walls
Don't cry for sleeping kittens
'Cause they won't die today
We'll cover them with flowers
They dream their dreams away
They'll dream their dreams away
Awaiting an audience
Awaiting an audience
Awaiting an audience
Awaiting an audience
Nefi and Girly were asleep in the yard
Nefi and Girly were asleep in the yard
Nefi and Girly were asleep in the yard
Nefi and Girly were asleep in the yard1Embed
