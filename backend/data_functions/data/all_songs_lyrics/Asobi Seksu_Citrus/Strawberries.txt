Strawberries Lyrics赤い空のように
ぶつまたも続く
イチゴの畑の中にいると
ほら、聞こえに
大きな声で呼んで
忘れないでと叫ぶ
Now they are　増えていく
うるさいイチゴたち
またイチゴの畑の中にいると
ほら、聞こえに
大きな声で呼んで
忘れないでと叫ぶ
Official English translation:
Like a red sky it goes on forever
When you're in the strawberry fields
Just listen you can hear them
They'll call out loudly
They shout don't forget about me
Now they're slowly disappearing
The deafening strawberries
But when you're in the strawberry fields
Just listen you'll still hear them
They'll call out loudly
They shout
Don't forget about meEmbed
