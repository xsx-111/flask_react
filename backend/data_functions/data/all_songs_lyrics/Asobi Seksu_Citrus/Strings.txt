Strings LyricsBoy who came to sit with you
He talked to your eyes
I can't forget now
For a thought
Girls who over and over
They looked right through you
I can't look back now
So I'll pretend
That I pretend
Let me pretend for awhile
La la la la
Kimi to ireba nanimo mienai
Kimi to nara dokodemo iku
Nanimo nai kara
Yoake demo
Itsudemo yobu
Yume no youni shizunde iku
Boy whose cloudy voice calls you
X's in your eyes
I can't be still now
For a thought
Girls whose tensions just kill you
Shivers in your spine
Words don't come easy
So I'll pretend
That I pretend
Let me pretend for a while
La la la la
Kimi to ireba nanimo mienai
Kimi to nara dokodemo ike
Nanimo nai kara
Yoake demo
Itsudemo yobu
Yume no youni shizunde ikeEmbed
