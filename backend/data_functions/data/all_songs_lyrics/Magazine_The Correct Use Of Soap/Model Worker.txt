Model Worker LyricsI'm sick of working on the land
I wanna work with machines and look handsome
I have been indulging
In ostentatious display
Doing little more than eat
Three square meals a day
And I've been shirking my duty
So I've been sending gifts to curry favour
But because I love you
And because you love me
A model worker
I'II willingly be
I need a holiday, I've not been well
Take me to the Brocade River Hotel
And I just want to know
While the revolution lasts
Will it enable me
To swallow broken glass?
I'm not too worried by the enemy
I know that Carter will look after me
And I just want to know
While the revolution lasts
Will it enable me
To swallow broken glass?
I have been indulging in ostentatious display
Doing little more than eat three square meals a day
But because I love you
And because you love me
A model worker I'll willingly be
A model worker I'll willingly be...Embed
