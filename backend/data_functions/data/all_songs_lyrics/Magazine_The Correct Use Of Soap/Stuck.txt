Stuck LyricsIn the rush
The rush of my senses
In the heat
The heat of this moment
In the Palace of Nations
I think I can love you out of weakness
In the heat of this moment I stick myself in laughter
Run for it
I'm running away
Know-it-all
I will return again
Pushing myself so helpless
Hopeless
When I can love you out of weakness
Which of us is to blame?
I'm stupid
I only know enough to get out of the rain
Oh, I really tiptoe, I really tiptoe
Stop
When you cease to amaze me
Take a look
My part in the pattern
I know it'll never matter
So I stick myself in laughter
I may love you out of weakness
Is that what I was afraid of?Embed
