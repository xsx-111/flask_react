Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) LyricsLooking at the devil
Grinning at his gun
Fingers start shaking
I begin to run
Thank you for letting me be myself again
Bullets start chasing
I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle and
I was on the top
I want to Thank you ...
Thank you for the party
I could never stay
Many things is on my mind
Words in the way
Thank you ..1Embed
