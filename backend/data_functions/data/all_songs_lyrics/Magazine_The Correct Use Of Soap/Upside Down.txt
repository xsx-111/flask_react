Upside Down LyricsI think of the distance
Between you and me
Which doesn't explain
Why the strangest places still call my name
I don't know how to live, I only know how to disappear
And I don't want to travel and I don't want to stay here
They speak of destiny and fate
And powers that move unseen
And I get these pictures
Of how my life might have been
I hear home is where the heart is
But I never get to learn where my heart is
Upside down
Upside down
I'm always turning things upside down
Upside down
Upside down
I'm always turning things upside down
Upside down
Upside down
I'm always turning things upside down
Upside down
Upside down
I'm always turning things upside down
The timing was right
It was still a surprise
To find my heart had followed my eyes
I was just another man with his eyes on you
And a need for agony that he had to subdue
Upside down
Upside down
I'm always turning things upside down
Upside down
Upside down
I'm always turning things upside down
Upside down
Upside down
I'm always turning things upside down
Upside down
Upside down
I'm always turning things upside down
Upside down
Upside down
Upside down
Upside down
Upside down (In your eyes)
Upside down (In your eyes)
Upside down
Upside down
Upside down (In your eyes)
Upside down (In your eyes)
I'm always turning things upside down...Embed
