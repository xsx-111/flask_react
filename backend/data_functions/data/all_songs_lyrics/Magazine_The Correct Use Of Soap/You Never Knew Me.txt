You Never Knew Me LyricsI don't want to turn around
And find I'd got it wrong
Or that I should have been laughing all along
You're what keeps me alive
You're what's destroying me
Do you want the truth or do you want your sanity?
You were hell
And everything else was just a mess
I found I'd stepped into the deepest unhappiness
We get back
I bleed into you
Thank God that I don't love you
All of that's behind me now
Still seems to be above you
I don't know
I don't know whether I ever knew you
But I know you
I know you never knew me
I don't know
I don't know whether I ever knew you
But I know you
I know you never knew me
Do you want to?
Hope doesn't serve me now
I don't move fast at all these days
You think you've understood
You're ignorant that way
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry I can't be cancelled out like this
We had to kill too much
Before we could even kiss
I don't know ...Embed
