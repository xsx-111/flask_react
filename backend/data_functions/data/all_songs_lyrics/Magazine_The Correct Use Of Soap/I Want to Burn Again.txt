I Want to Burn Again LyricsThe newcomer arrives
Possession and guilt in his face
Apologises to the Customs man
For the gaping hole in his suitcase
Says 'I've seen where promises are made
I've seen how people are undone
It's always done
Man to man
One to one
I'm ditching an empty suitcase
I've been in Storytown
I've been swimming in poisons
Been slowing up and down
I've known the eeriest wounds
The soul's long quarantine
When no rewards remain
No one and nothing comes clean
I've been blown about for years
On my way to you
I've been blown about for years
On my way to you
And I still turn to love
I want to burn again
And I still turn to love
In a room
Where arrangements are made for success
You try to say that you possess me
By your caress
I met your lover yesterday
Wearing some things I left at your place
Singing a song that means a lot to me
I've known a certain grace
I've been blown about for years
On my way to you ..
And I still turn to love
I'm still turning
I want to burn again1Embed
