Sweetheart Contract LyricsWe drank from cups on standard-issue sofas under scaffolding
Informed sources said we were seen by observers - it's a meeting
I received an education
I was dominant for hours
I won myself a wealth of weapons, supermassive wealth
Under a sweetheart contract which clearly stated
'Strength is always health'
I had one upper hand
I was dominant for hours
I want to be there, on the far side of sin
I've been putting myself through hell, waiting for hell to begin
I got insurance
I was dominant for hours
My tour-de-force is to forget all that's gone on around and about me
My manners are forever and whatever sells the newspapers suits me
I got an education
I was dominant for hours
I had one upper hand
I was dominant for hours
I got insurance
I was dominant for hours
We'd better give it back, it's not oursEmbed
