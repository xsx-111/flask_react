Aimee LyricsTell me what do I do about it
When you break down and cry
I try to give you all my love and affection
Please believe me, I try
Oh Aimee
I know I've been unkind
I guess I wasn't much of a friend
Oh Aimee
Let's leave it all behind
'Cause I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you till the end
Aimee, there's so much you give me
So much to live for
When I'm feeling down
You just turn it around
And the pain Isn't there anymore
Oh Aimee
I know I've been unkind
I guess I wasn't much of a friend
Oh yeah, Aimee
Let's leave it all behind
'Cause I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you till the end
Angel in the night
You'll be my angel in the night
Angel in the night
You'll be my angel in the night
Angel in the night
You'll be my angel in the night
Don't ever tell me lies
'Cause I'll always be your friend
And I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you till the end
So tell me what do I do about it
When you break down and cry
I try to give you all my love and affection
Please believe me, I try
Oh Aimee
I know I've been unkind
I know I wasn't much of a friend, oh Yeah
Aimee
Let's leave it all behind
'Cause I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you till the end
Angel in the night
You'll be my angel in the night
Angel in the night
You'll be my angel in the night
Angel in the night
You'll be my angel in the night
Please be my angel in the nightEmbed
