Tomorrow Lyrics
Have you read the message
The writing on the wall
Could it be the answer
The answer to it all
What's going down in heaven
I'm playing with your head
Don't believe them when they tell you
You'd be better off dead
Living in the thunder
Driving me insane
Can I get a witness to take away the pain
Walking on the water
Going nowhere fast
Feeling like I'm walking
With no shoes on broken glass
You know it

You don't have to leave the lights on
I'm so used to being blind
No more goodbyes or yesterdays
So it's, I'll see you tomorrow
I'll see you tomorrow

Welcome to the sideshow
I'll cut it to the chase
Yeah I can hear you thinking
It's going all to waste
I don't mean to offend you
When I look you in the eyes
What's all this commotion?
It leaves me mystified
Chasing all the rainbows
Falling from the sky
I know your intentions are all a bunch of lies
I'm running out of patience
Falling off track
You better start to worry
Because I may not make it black
All right now
You don't have to leave the lights on
I'm so used to being blind
One good reason to blow me away
So it's, I'll see you tomorrow
I'll see you tomorrow

Can it wait until tomorrow?
Because tomorrow never comes
Living in the big house
Dying by rail
If I wanted your opinion
I'd call you up in hell
Could that be the mailman
Knocking on the door
Or just another light weight
Finally evening the score
You know it

You don't have to leave the lights on
I'm so used to being blind
No more goodbyes or yesterdays
So it's, I'll see you tomorrow
No more reasons to blow you away
So it's, I'll see you tomorrowEmbed
