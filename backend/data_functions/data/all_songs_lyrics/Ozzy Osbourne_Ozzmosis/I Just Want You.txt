I Just Want You Lyrics
There are no unlockable doors
There are no unwinnable wars
There are no unrightable wrongs
Or unsingable songs
There are no unbeatable odds
There are no believable gods
There are no unnameable names
Shall I say it again, yeah
There are no impossible dreams
There are no invisible seams
Each night when the day is through
I don't ask much

I just want you
I just want you

There are no uncriminal crimes
There are no unrhymable rhymes
There are no identical twins
Or forgivable sins
There are no incurable ills
There are no unkillable thrills
One thing and you know it's true
I don't ask much
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
I used to go to bed so high and wired
Yeah - yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I'll buy myself some plastic water
I guess I should have married Lennon's daughter
Yeah - yeah, yeah, yeah
There are no unachievable goals
There are no unsaveable souls
No legitimate kings or queens
Do you know what I mean? Yeah
There are no indisputable truths
And there ain't no fountain of youth
Each night when the day is through
I don't ask much

I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just want you
I just want you
Hey, yeah
I just want you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just want you
Hey
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
YeahEmbed
