Thunder Underground Lyrics
Your thoughts are compromising
Self-centered, patronizing
Your image supersedes your soul
You find me mystifying
Subhuman, so annoying
You can't have me under control

You think you live forever
You don't find that profound
You won't think you're so clever
When you hear thunder underground
All right now

Your morbid fear of losing
Destroys the lives you're using
You only have one point of view
The stigma of delusion
Confirms your self illusion
And after all this could be you

You think you live forever
You don't find that profound
You won't think you're so clever
When you hear thunder underground
Here we go now
Could it be that I have found my mind
Or have I gone insane?
Roller coaster of the madness
And there's only me to blame
The ever faithful hand of doom
Will take the pain away
I'll never know the answer to it all
Until my dying day
Your bullshit culture licking
Can't stop the deathwatch ticking
You're only mortal after all
Your appetite for power
Subvert your every hour
But every time the mighty fall

You think you live forever
You don't find that profound
You won't think you're so clever
When you hear thunder underground
Here we go nowEmbed
