Denial Lyrics
You are my only daughter
I guess I made you twice
You look inside my other
He'll give you bad advice
I will tell you I'm ok
But deep inside I'm afraid
I don't drink holy water
I'm not the son of Christ
I ain't no black Messiah
And I don't load my dice
You can tell me you're all right
But why are you so afraid?

You're in the denial
You never will believe it's you
Denial
You always hide behind the truth
You'll never believe it
You'll never believe it's you

I don't think I'm amazing
In fact I'm quite insane
To live inside my bucket
With all my plastic chains
People tell me every time
I look at the wrong all right
You're in the denial
You'll never will believe it's you
Denial
You always hide behind the truth
You'll never believe it, you'll never believe it's you 

Secrets told you
Dreamland holds you
Secrets told you
You wouldn't believe it
You couldn't conceive it
Secrets told you
You want to receive it
You got to believe it's you
You're on a trip already
I'm tripping out alright
I'll get these slow and steady
Just sit and hold on tight

Denial, you never will believe
It's you
Denial, you always hide behind
The truth
Denial, you never will believe
It's you
Denial, you always hide behind
The truth, yeah, yeah
Behind the truth, yeah, yeah
It's true, yeah, yeah
Behind the truth, yeah, yeah
It's you, yeah, yeah
Behind the truth, yeah, yeah
It's going to be alright, just hold on tight Embed
