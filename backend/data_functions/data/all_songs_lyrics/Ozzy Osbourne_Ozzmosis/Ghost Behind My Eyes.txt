Ghost Behind My Eyes Lyrics
There is a person living in my head
She comes to visit every night in bed
I fight the demon, but it just won't fall
The voices in my dungeon
Starting to call

The spiders dancing on the wall
Suicide of love we could have had it all
And it is you
You are the ghost behind my eyes
I can't see through you
You are the ghost behind my eyes
The ghost that tells me lies

The princess of the dark has made my mind home
My haunted head and her won't leave me alone
She dances on my heart with fire in my soul
I hate that feeling when I'm losing control

The spiders dancing on the wall
Suicide of love we could have had it all
And it is you
You are the ghost behind my eyes
I can't see through you
You are the ghost behind my eyes
The ghost that tells me lies
I wish to god that I could sleep again
Oh peace again
And wake up from this nightmare free again
Free again, oh me again
There is a woman living in my head
She comes to visit every night in bed

The spiders dancing on the wall
Suicide of love we could have had it all
And it is you
You are the ghost behind my eyes
You, you are the ghost behind my eyes 
Behind my eyes
The ghost behind my eyes Embed
