Old L.A. Tonight Lyrics
Look in the future
Look in to my eyes and tell me
Everything's all right
Tell me where we're going
I'm so afraid because I don't know
What's going on with my life

But it'll be all right tonight
Will it be all right tonight
Are we doing all right in old L.A. tonight?

Sitting by the ocean
Mapping out my plans of action
Baby they include you
I wish you'd send a message
Maybe I'm just better off not
Knowing who knew

But it'll be all right tonight
I'm going to be all right tonight
Are we doing all right in old L.A. tonight?
Those summer nights
When I look in your eyes
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Out of my mind
And I'll never know why
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Who could imagine such a thing
Could happen to you?
It's going to be all right in old L.A. tonight
Those summer nights
When I look in your eyes
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Out of my mind
And I'll never know why
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
It's going to be all right in old L.A. tonightEmbed
