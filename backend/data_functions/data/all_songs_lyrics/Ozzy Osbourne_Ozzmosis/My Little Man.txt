My Little Man Lyrics
Don't you know I love you more
Than life itself
Don't you know that you're my pride
And I would not have you
Walking through this world
Without me by your side

Go to sleep my little man
Don't you weep my little man

I'd like to keep you with me
All your life
But I know I can't do that
So I must try to teach you
Wrong from right
To keep the vultures from
Your back


And when you're dreaming
You can talk to angels
So wipe the tears from your eyes
And if there's demons
That try to steal your breath away
You can't believe that know
My spirit will be standing by your side
You saved me, you gave me
The greatest gift of all
Believe me, believe
There ain't no mountain that's too tall
I will gladly carry your cross for you
To take your pain away
But what I can't carry is my love for you
Beyond my dying day
So be strong my little man
When I'm gone my little man
You got to be my little man
So don't you weep my little man
Go to sleep my little man
Don't you weep my little man
You got to be my little man
So don't you weep my little manEmbed
