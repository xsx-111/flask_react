See You on the Other Side Lyrics
Voices (Voices, voices), a thousand, thousand voices
Whispering (Whispering, whispering), the time has passed for choices
Golden days are passing over, yeah

I can't seem to see you baby
Although my eyes are open wide
But I know I'll see you once more

When I see you, I'll see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side

Leaving (Leaving, leaving), I hate to see you cry
Grieving (Grieving, grieving), I hate to say goodbye
Dust and ash forever, yeah

Though I know we must be parted
As sure as stars are in the sky
I'm gonna see you when it comes to glory

And I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side, yeah
Never thought I'd feel like this
Strange to be alone, yeah
But we'll be together
Carved in stone, carved in stone, carved in stone

Hold me (Hold me, hold me), hold me tight I'm falling
Far away (Far away, far away), distant voices calling
I'm so cold, I need you darling, yeah

I was down, but now I'm flying
Straight across the great divide
I know you're crying, but I'll stop you crying

When I see you, I see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you, see you on the other side
I'm gonna see you, see you on the other side
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah

I'll see you, see you on the other side
I'm gonna see you, see you on the other side
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side
I want to see you, yeah, yeah, yeah, see you on the other side
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side
I'm gonna see you, see you on the other side3Embed
