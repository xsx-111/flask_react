Carried Away Lyrics
Last night, I drifted down to the docks
The water, glittering and black
The snow fell lightly and disappeared
I felt the old ropes grow slack

I thought I'd dissolve
When the beacon revolved
I just get carried, so carried
Carried away

Once, I had a ship
Yes, I had a map
I had the wind
Like a tree has sap

I sank into
These banks of clay
I just get carried, so carried
Carried...

Those rooms were freezing
And always dark
But where we were never mattered
Your head was golden
There was lightning in your arms
And then the glass shattered
It was noon at midnight
The day that never ends
The lamp, it whispers
And makes amends

Everything was more
Than I took it for
I just get carried, so carried
Carried away
