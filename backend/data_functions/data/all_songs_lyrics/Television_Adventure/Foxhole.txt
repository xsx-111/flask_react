Foxhole Lyrics
Soldier boy stands
At a full salute
Wants your orders
To execute
Send him out
'Neath the screaming red lights
In a narrow ditch
For the funny fights

(Foxhole, foxhole) Oh no, danger
(Foxhole, foxhole) Where's my guardian angel?
(Foxhole, foxhole) Oh, no

You show me the war
I don't know what for
You show me the war
But that war - such a bore

In the line of duty
In the line of fire
A heartless heart
Is my proper attire
(Foxhole, foxhole) Too much danger
(Foxhole, foxhole) Where's my guardian angel?
(Foxhole, foxhole) Too much danger

The flashing sword
It's been explored
A perfect slice
A perfect slice of life

I feel the shells hit
Moonlight web
Goodbye arms
So long, head

(Foxhole, foxhole) Too much danger
(Foxhole, foxhole) Hello, guardian angel
(Foxhole, foxhole) Oh, more danger

You pin me down
Go ahead, it's a cinch
You pin me down
You'll feel the pinch
I was trained for the fights
(Foxhole, foxhole)
(Foxhole, foxhole)
(Foxhole, foxhole)
(Foxhole, foxhole)
