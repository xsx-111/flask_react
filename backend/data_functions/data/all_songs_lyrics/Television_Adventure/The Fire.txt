The Fire Lyrics
Storms all that summer
We lived in the wind
Out in some room in the wind
Your hands, they were folded
You knew no demands
My tongue, it clattered like tin

My eyes repeat
They take my seat
Your eyes, they say you resigned from the heat

We leaned in the cold
Holding our breath
Watching the corners turn corners

Coins on the table
The cards in the air
The face at the window kept smiling
Storms all that winter
We stayed locked away
Waiting, watching, falling
End of the street
Horizons retreat
You, you ran with it
I wish I could
Sleep is not sleep
My eyes repeat
You take the voltage
That watches you weep

You caught the voice
I listen close
All that I heard was the echoes

Praise emptiness
Her rose-colored dress
Her circling motions
Praise emptiness
Everything scattered
Nothing was missed
We took our house in the fire1Embed
