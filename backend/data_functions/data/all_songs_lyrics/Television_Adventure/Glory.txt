Glory Lyrics
I was out stumbling in the rain
Staring at your lips so red
You said, "'Blah, blah, blah."
I got a pillow stuck in my head

How could I argue with a mirror?
She looked at me - yes, I hear her

When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry
When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry

She said, "There's a halo on that truck."
"Won't you please get it for me?"
I said, "Of course, my little swan."
"If ever and ever you adore me."

She got mad - she said, "You're too steep."
Puts on her boxing gloves and went to sleep
When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry
When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry
When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry
When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry

(I used to see so poorly) When I see the glory
(And then I saw the glory) I ain't gotta worry
(Now, I used to worry) When I see the glory
(Then I saw the glory) I ain't gotta worry
(Oh, I saw the glory) When I see the glory
(And I see the glory) I ain't gotta worry
(I used to hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry) When I see the glory
(Hurry, hurry, hurry) I ain't gotta worry
(Then I see the glory) When I see the glory
(Oh, I see the glory) I ain't gotta worryEmbed
