Days Lyrics
Up in the high, high hills
With my floating friend
Watching all the silver
No one will ever spend
I feel the touch of her hand
And all it will erase
These footprints I followed
Though they followed my every pace

Days
Days
Days
Be more than all we have

No matter how much I cross
I always see the same stream
I'm standing up on these bridges
That are standing in a dream

Days
Days
Days
Be more than all we have
Days
Days
Days
Days
