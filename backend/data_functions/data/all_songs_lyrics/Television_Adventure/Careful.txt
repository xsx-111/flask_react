Careful Lyrics
I jump out of bed
I pull down the shade
I used to have such sweet dreams
Now it's more like an air raid
I see the opposition clear
Oh, I see them stare

(I don't care) It doesn't matter to me
(I don't care) I never think about it
(I don't care)

Slip out of myself like a shadow
And somersault through walls
I can't tell, it's really so odd
Is it spring or fall?
Your wine is just sour grapes
Pour me a glass anytime I'm not there

(I don't care) It doesn't matter to me
(I don't care) I never think about it
(I don't...)
(Careful, careful) I'm not bitter, I just get so sore
(Careful, careful) You know, I need that girl more and more
'Cause when she whispers
Oh, in my ear
It gets so hard, it gets so hard
It gets so hard

To get out of bed
It's more than I can do
If someone must work today
Then let it be you
All this confusion
It hit me like a dare

(I don't care) It doesn't matter to me
(I don't care) I never think about it
(I don't care)
(I don't care) It doesn't matter to me
(I don't care) It never enters my mind
(I...)
(I don't care) All of it matters to me
(I don't care) Who cares?
(I don't care)Embed
