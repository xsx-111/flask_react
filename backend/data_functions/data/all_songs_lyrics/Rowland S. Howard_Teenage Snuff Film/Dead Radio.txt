Dead Radio LyricsYou're bad for me like cigarettes
But I haven't sucked enough of you yet
Nothing is sacred and nothing is true
I'm no-one that's nowhere when I'm here with you
I've lost the power I had to distinguish
Between what to ignite and what to extinguish
I blew in last night, I'm the host from the coast
When the lighting is bad I'm the man with the most
You left me to choke on a heart up in smoke
Smiling through your tears and your tetracycline overdose
You're good for me like Coca-Cola
I don't get any younger, you don't get any older
Everything's sacred and everything's true
All of this is possible when I'm here with you
I've got a lot to say but I keep my own counsel
I'd like to spit it out but I won't speak with my mouth full
I blew in last night, I'm the host from the coast
When the lighting is bad I'm the man with the most
You left me to choke on a heart up in smoke
Smiling through your tears and your tetracycline overdoseEmbed
