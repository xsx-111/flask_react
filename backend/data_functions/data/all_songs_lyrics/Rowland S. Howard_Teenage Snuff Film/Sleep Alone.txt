Sleep Alone LyricsFirst I shut down the stars
Because you said they ruled us
Then I took out Mars
He was the cruelest
His lover followed suit
By way of suicide
And the others stood there silent
As I dealt out peace of mind
Shut me up
Shut me down
Stop me if you can
My love, I'll show you nothing
I'm a misanthropic man
Shut me up
Shut me down
Stop me if you can
My love, I'll show you nothing
I'm a misanthropic man
Shut me up
Shut me down
Stop me if you can
My love, I'm less than nothing
I'm a misanthropic man
This is the journey
To the edge of the night
I've got no companions
Louis Celine's on my side
I don't need nothing from no-one
The needle's in the red
Nothing to lose
Everything's dead
Shut me up
Shut me down
Stop me if you can
My love, I'll show you nothing
I'm a misanthropic man
Shut me up
Shut me down
Stop me if you can
My love, I'm less than nothing
I'm a misanthropic man
The sky is empty, silent
The Earth is still as stone
Nothing stands above me
Now I can sleep aloneEmbed
