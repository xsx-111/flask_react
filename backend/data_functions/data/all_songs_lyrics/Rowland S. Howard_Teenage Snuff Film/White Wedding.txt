White Wedding LyricsHey little sister what have you done
Hey little sister who's the only one
Hey little sister who's your superman
Hey little sister who's the one you want
Hey little sister shot gun!
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again
Hey little sister what have you done
Hey little sister who's the only one
I've been away for so long
I've been away for so long
I let you go for so long
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again
There is nothin' safe in this world
There is nothin' sacred in this world
And there's nothin' sure in this world
And there's nothin' pure in this world
Look for something left in this world
Start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start againEmbed
