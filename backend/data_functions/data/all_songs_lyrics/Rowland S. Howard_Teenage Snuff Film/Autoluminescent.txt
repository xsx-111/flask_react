Autoluminescent Lyrics
I am blinding
Autoluminescent
I am white heat
I am heaven sent
I was a nightmare
But I'm not gonna go there
Again

Into the black hole  lived in the darkness
The house of no contest
Make mine a meteor
Rise me above the rest
I'm soaring through outer space
There is no better place
To be

I'm bigger than Jesus Christ
I'm greater than God in light
I am dangerous
I cut like the sharpest knife
I'm going nova
And I hope I can hold her
... in
Into the dark darkness
I gave away myself
Tripped on the spiral stairs
Tumbling down the well
I fell on a soft spot
I'm white heat, I'm white hot
