Silver Chain LyricsFear and self loathing
Forged a chain of silver ore
By the time I stop singing
You won't love me anymore
I ran to the river
Crying, "river cure me"
But the river just laughed
Washing sand over me

Girl child your daddy's
Silver chain's nine miles long
From every link of that chain
Hangs a heart he has wronged
Little girl take the length
Of your father's bright chain
And bind me to you
I don't care what you do
I ran to the fire
"Fire purify me"
The fire licked my skin
But it did not set me free
I turned to the bottle
"Alcohol cure me
Let me sleep without dreaming"
Alcohol lied to me
Girl child your daddy's
Silver chain's nine miles long
From every link of that chain
Hangs a heart he has wronged
Little girl take the length
Of your father's bright chain
And bind me to you
I don't care what you do
I spoke to the forest
I spoke to the trees
I spoke to the river
But it did not speak to me
I carved your name
In the cypress tree bark
I tattooed your name
In a ring round my heart
I wore out my welcome
I wore out myself
I wore out my reason
I wore out my health
I forgot my name
On the day that you came...
Girl child your daddy's
Silver chain's nine miles long
From every link of that chain
Hangs a heart he has wronged
Little girl take the length
Of your father's bright chain
And bind me to you
I don't care what you doEmbed
