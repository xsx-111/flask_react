She Cried LyricsI met her at the usual place
Put my arms around her waist
Look into that swimming pool eyes
When I told her
I didn't love her anymore
She cried
When I told her
Her kisses were not like before
She cried
She cried
She cried
When I kissed her
With a kiss that only meant goodbye
She cried
When I stood there
I couldn't look her in the eyes
She cried
I know that our romance was over and done
But for her it had just begun
She cried
She cried
When I kissed her
With a kiss that only meant goodbye
She cried
When I told her
Another girl had caught my eye
She cried
She cried
She cried
When I told her
When I kissed her goodbye
Oh my baby
Oh my God what have I done
What have I doneEmbed
