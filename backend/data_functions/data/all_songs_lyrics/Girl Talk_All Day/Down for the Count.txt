Down for the Count Lyrics
Oh, baby do you know what that's worth?
Oh, Heaven is a place on earth
They say in Heaven, love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Oh, Heaven is a place on Earth

We got em goin' down for the count
Yes sir it's the beast from Decatur
Cain't see enemies and the haters
Real sharp on my thing like a razor
Blade, come clean like a shape up
So guess I got a game of tape up
But e'rybody gonnaa feel the need to say sum'n
But can't speak up whenever you face 'em
Thats what I call microphone gangsters
Yea I got 'em okie-doke, teah I'm raw you know my flow
Cause B.O.B. be actin hard like a Viagra overdose
Talkin that noise on all them songs
A buncha lil' boys but you all look grown
Those niggas there and these niggas here
It really don't matta cause they all just clones
Go to school, read a book, be a lawyer
Hell yeah man I'm all for the cause
Ain't tryin to get involved with the law sir
But a nigga will get caught with the Mausberg
And that just ain't a threat on the song
Don't get it wrong cause this track is my own
Cause niggas that slip they don't last long
We got em goin' down for the count, lookin' at the ground
That's why we got haters, that's why we got haters
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go
Haters everywhere we go, where we go
Haters goin' down for the count (ONE) lookin' at the ground (TWO)
I think you're a hater, I think you're a hater
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go
Haters everywhere we go, where we go, haters goin down for the count
Down down down down down down down down
Round round round round round round round

I got them diamonds on my neck
Got patron in my cup
If you want it come and get it
Shawty I don't give a fuck
See it's Friday night
And I just got paid
I done had a hard week
Now its time to celebrate

Shake shake that ass
Rock rock them hips
Shake shake that ass
Damn, damn
Shake shake that ass
Rock rock them hips
Shake shake that ass
Damn, damn
Damn, damn
(In the middle of our street)
Damn, damn
(In the middle of our-)

Oh, we goin' overseas with this baby, overseas!
Oh, what, what you say, baby girl?
I know you, and I know what you like to do

Yo, see all I do, drink my brew, get high too
I get high too
Yes I like, what you like, good lesbian, don't call her a dike
Nope!
She just bounced, she comes over, left coast style, she ain't sober!
She rolled over, (he'd get posered?), chip on her shoulder, (been done colder?)
(Bad man good?), keep it hood, sell your soul (with a break in the wood?)
She just bucked, keep in the club, ride the rub, ride the dub
All I do is party, ha, ha, ha, ha
All I do is party, ha, ha, ha, ha
So bounce low, bounce low
Bounce high, bounce high
All I do is party, ha, ha, ha, ha

This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya over-zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function, high class luncheon
Food they're serving, you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

La la la
La la la la la
La la la
La la la la la
(Just bust a move)
La la la
La la la la la
La la la
La la la la la
(Just bust a move)

Give it to me, bring it here
Like whoa
Girl, shake your tail, shake your tail
Give it to me, bring it here
Like whoa

You make me wanna say
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
My god

Ah hah, okay
Ah hah, okay, whassup? Shut up!
Ah hah, okay, whassup? Shut up!
Ah hah, okay, whassup? Shut up!
Ah hah, okay, whassup? Shut up!

Get it, get it, get it girl
Ah hah, get it girl, okay, get it girl
Get it, get it, get it girl
Get it, get it, get it girl
Ah hah, get it girl, okay, get it girl
Get it girl
Get it girl
Get it girlEmbed
