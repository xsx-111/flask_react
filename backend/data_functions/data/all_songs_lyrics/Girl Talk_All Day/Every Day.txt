Every Day Lyrics
I need everybody to report to the dance floor right now
The world is very different now
You know why
It's Gucci time
Big Gucci trap boys call me Brick Gucci
Dime piece time piece got my Swiss movin'
Swiss cheese out a hater if he act foolish
Swizz Beats Gucci Mane call it trap music
I think I need an ESPY the rappers best respect me
They try to Ron Artest me they gone have to arrest me
With a doubt I bring 'em out
The kid is all she think about
She cheated wit la flarе
But he didn't spill a drink about her
Do you know what time it is
Gucci timе
Fifteen for every diamond bitch
I'm hood rich wealthy and all that dough
I own forty bars but I have no idea
Its Gucci time!
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this fucking ice ain't no need to cut the lights on
Its Gucci time!
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this fucking ice ain't no need to cut the lights on
Bah bah bah beat it up like a drummer

Now tuned into the motherfucking greatest
Turn the music up in the headphones
I got you

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Kick that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta kick that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta kick that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta kick that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta kick that dirt off your shoulder
Pretty Girl
Pretty Girl

Point 'em out, point 'em out, point 'em out
Point 'em out, point 'em out, point 'em out
Point 'em out, point 'em out, point 'em out

It's what we living in, man, it ain't nothing but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya
And New York brothers gettin shot for bombers
Now they got your life in the palm of
They hand like California
Players with dubs of hydroponic marijuana
Gangbangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my boy Pots died on the corner
Behind a five dollar dice game
I saw him once before he died wish it was twice, man
I remember being eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad not even carin' what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin' to an end
And I had to quit lettin' that devil push me to the sin
My brother been in the pen for damn near ten
But now it look like when he come out man I'm goin' in
So now I walk around with my mind blown in my own little zone
'Cause one day you're here, the next day you're gone
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will live as oneEmbed
