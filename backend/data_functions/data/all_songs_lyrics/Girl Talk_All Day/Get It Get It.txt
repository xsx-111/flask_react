Get out the wayy
Pretty boy comin' thru
Me and my crew we swagging in the room
Girls on my heavy 'cause I look so sexy
Yellow diamond shawty in the club straight flexin'
I'm lookin' for a yellow soldier long haired star
Thick in the hips come and get in my car
You party with a star we take off and go to mars
Pretty boy take off in 5,4,3,2,1

Throwing out those bangs
Throw your fucking sets up
Know how we start, come catch up
Ain't nobody fucking with this I bet ya
And my age you should name on the check up
Bang, while you wait, it all goes down
Swipe through the city, that I call my town
And if you fucking up, damn right you a clown
Ain't bangin' high, don't make no sound
Episodes of the violence bang
Shots go hard, make your brain cells ring
Floating with the stars in the city of the Caine
Let's ride out, throw it out and bang
Bang

Bang, bang

Bang, bang
(All day)
Bang, bang
(All day)
