Let It Out Lyrics
Gon' head let it out
Gon' head let it out
Gon' head let it out
Take it off, stretch it out, gon' head let it out

Bounce wit me, Bounce wit me
Ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch
Bounce wit me, Bounce wit me
Yeah
Can I hit in the morning
Without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you want me?
If I couldn't get you finer things
Like all of them diamond rings bitches kill FOR
Would you still roll?
If we couldn't see the sun risin off the shore of Thailand
Would you RIDE THEN, if I wasn't drivin?
If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it - could ya
See yourself with a nigga workin' harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a balla? So you can shop and tear the mall up?
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so
Can I get a fuck you
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough
(Can I get a WOOP WOOP)
(To these niggas from all of my bitches)
(Who don't got love for niggas without dubs?)
Can I get a fuck you
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough
(Can I get a WOOP WOOP)
(To these niggas from all of my bitches)
(Who don't got love for niggas without dubs?)
(Can I get a) twerk twerk, bounce bounce, clap clap
(Can I get a) twerk twerk, bounce bounce, clap clap
(Can I get a) twerk twerk, bounce bounce, clap clap
(Can I get a) twerk twerk, bounce bounce, clap clap

Whatcha doin' girl with all that
Up and down, up and down
Man that booty real phat
Runnin' round, runnin' round
I like the way ya move that
Man, I wanna screw that (Oooweee!)
Knock that coochie out the park
Hit it like a ball bat
Fall back & squeeze on that piece
Juices squirtin'
You must be a stripper or a new member of the twerk team
Bouncing that thing in them jeans got it jerkin'
Busting out the seams in them jeans then it's workin'
Make that thang clap, g-string too spicy
Down south girl gonna do the freakin' dances
Bunch of cornbread fed, never scared, open legs
Lady in the streets but real freak in tha bed
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk
That ass (c'mon)
Twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk
That ass (c'mon)
Twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk
That ass (c'mon)
Move that ass
Left & right gon' work that ass
Please tell us why, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there mister blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Ev'rybody smiles at you

You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe
Kicking mad flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm... kicking... new.... flava in ya ear
Mack's a brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm... kicking... new.... flava in ya ear
Mack's a brand new flava in ya ear

Ohh
We pop champagne
We pop champagne
Hey, how we ball in the club i know u hate it
Mami dancin' on the floor i like she naked
When she laid up wit chu i know she fake it
All the girls give it to me, I ain't gotta take it, oh
Pop champagne
Ohhh, pop champagne
Ohh, we pop champagne
Ohh, we pop champagne

A lime to a lemon remind you of the sky
When I'm fuckin' and we on cloud nine for that minute
Admire your style and your physique
And I ain't trying to critique
But you deserve a good drink, so whats up?
What you sippin' on? Its no problem
Black and gold models like I'm pro-New Orleans
But shawty I'm far from a saint
But I got two AmExes that look the same way
Wale, D.C. that's me huh
My Prada say Prada and they Prada say Fila
I ain't gotta tell ya they know about me huh
Come to D.C. and I can make you a believer
See baby I'm a leader they always from a Libra
And I ain't trying to lead you wrong sugar I need ya
So would you please listen to what I'm a need from ya
Not for tonight, but for tomorrow's amnesia
Pretty Girls

(Ugly girls be quiet quiet, pretty girls clap clap like this)
(Ugly girls be quiet quiet, pretty girls clap clap like this)
(Ugly girls be quiet quiet, pretty girls clap clap like this)
(Ugly girls be quiet quiet, pretty girls clap clap like this)
