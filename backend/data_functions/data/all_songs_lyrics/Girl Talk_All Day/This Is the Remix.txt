This Is the Remix Lyrics
This is the remix
C'mon now

Yeah I like that
Can you feel it?
Hello Good morning tell me what the lip read
Pretty face, thin waist with the sick weave
First time fish tailing in the 6 speed
Real bad boy tell em come and get me
Im at the fight, been kinda like Bellmen
Only took the trip to the truck twice
Unpacked the Mac 11 and air max’s
Stuff six figures in my damn air mattress
Uh, I’m in love with large bills
A dime with a fat ass, thin waist and tall heels
Yeah, it’s the teflon Don
Hundred carrots in the charm tryna give it back to Sean

Ayo Tim man this the jump off right here man ! (Jump Off!)
Whoa! (Whoa!) Whoa!(Whoa!) Whoa! (Its Queen Bee jigga)
Its the jump off (Come on )
I been gone for a minute now I'm back at the jump off
Goons in the club in case somethin' jumps off
And back before the hive let the pumps off
In the graveyard is where you get dumped off
All we wanna do is party (Woo!)
And buy everybody at the bar bacardi (Woo!)
Black barbie dressed in blvgari
Im tryin to leave in somebody's ferrari
Spread love that's what a real mob do
Keep it gangsta look out for her people (for her people)
Im the wicked chick of the east, you better keep the peace (Aiyyo!)
Or out come the beast
We the best still there's room for improvement
Our presence is felt like a black panther movement
Seven quarter to eights back to back with em (back to back)
And I'm sittin on chrome seven times platinum
This is for my peeps with the bentleys and the hummers and the benz
Escalades wit the twenty-three inch rims (Oh!)
Jumpin' out the jaguar with the tims(what) keep your bread up
And live good east coast west coast worldwide
All ma playas in the hood stay fly
And if you ballin' let me hear you say right (right)

Wait! Stop the party! I don't wanna hurt nobody!

(Hey hey hey)
Woo!
Uh
(Hey)
Uh
(Hey Aww yeah)

Mmm Drop!

Uh hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel so around I spun (spun)
With no directions just tryna get some (some)
Trina chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)
This is how I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly I ended up with none
C'mon yo tear the roof off
Yo tear the roof off
Back off don't make me shoot ya'll
You don't want to fuck with us, ya don't (Ha)
You don't want to fuck with us, ya don't
Yo, you don't want to fuck with us, ya don't

Do ya wanna die?
(Don't get stuck now, roll with it)
Do ya wanna die?
(Don't get stuck now, roll with it)
Do ya wanna die?
(Don't get stuck now, roll with it)
Do ya wanna die?
(Don't get stuck now, roll with it)
Do ya wanna die?
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Do ya wanna die?
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Do ya wanna die?
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Do ya wanna die?
Well, I promise you

So help me, Jesus

Listen to the hit!

Rollin, gold two seater
Stash in the dash
Hole through heaters
Blockahhhhh put holes through beaters
Ghetto Fab stroll through Cheetahs
Ballin, Brooklyn dawn
Addicted to Crys hooked on Don
15 G's hookers on
Ma, I wanna see how you look in thongs
Hustlin, guys that send Po's
Cause I chop rocks the size of mentos
Blame me, trials aquit those
Look at the hurt your eyes will squit close
Pimpin' here's a new way to flirt
Listen to the two way alert

Lets go VIP boo raise your skirt
Holla back Young'n (Hoooo Hoooo! Go ahead baby)
Holla back (Hoooo Hoooo! Go ahead baby)
Holla back Young'n (Hoooo Hoooo! Go ahead baby)
