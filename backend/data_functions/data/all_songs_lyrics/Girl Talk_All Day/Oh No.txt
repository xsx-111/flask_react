Oh No Lyrics
Hit me

Generals gathered in their masses (Get out the way)
Just like witches at black masses (Get out the way bitch, Get out the way)
Evil minds that plot destruction (Get out the way)
Sorcerers of death's construction (Get out the way bitch, Get out the way)
In the fields the bodies burning (Get out the way)
As the war machine keeps turning (Get out the way bitch, Get out the way)
Death and hatred to mankind (Get out the way)
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh lord yeah!

OH NO! The fight's out
I'ma 'bout to punch yo...lights out
Get the FUCK back, guard ya grill
There's somethin' wrong, we can't stay still
I've been drankin' and bustin' two
And I been thankin' of bustin' you
Upside ya motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in, "Ohhh gurrlll", they'll be mo' dead
Causin' confusion, Disturbin Tha Peace
It's not an illusion, we runnin the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and golddiggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? NO NIGGA!
I'm doin' a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the FUCK outta my way
I'm D.U.I., hardly ever caught sober
And you about to get ran the FUCK over
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way

Tick tock you don't stop

They're forming in straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're piling in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

If you want it you can get it
If you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it rub it up and smack it
Look back at it I'm a addict
(Hey ho, let's go!)

Missy be puttin' it down, I'm the hottest round
I told y'all mother (*skurt*), y'all can't stop me
Now
Listen to me now, I'm lastin' twenty rounds
And if you want me (people) then come on get me now (YES)
Is you with me now (YES) then biggie biggie bounce (YES)
I know you dig the way I sw-sw-switch my style (HOLLA!!)
People sing around (YES)
Now people gather round, now people jump around
