On and On Lyrics
Uhh, I go, on and on and on and
Then take her to the crib and let your bone in
Easy, call em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay, dressed, to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past fo'
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home, tomorrow
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O., uhh
Back of my mind I hope she swallow (uh-huh)
Man She split a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryin to wait
Conversate, sex on the first date I state
"You know what you do to me"
She starts, "Well but I don't usually"
Then I, whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South, aoowww
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I screw
Jeans skirt butt-naked it all work
Now, now - we goin' til they kick us out, out
We goin' til they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us -

I want the world
You want the pussy
I want the pearl
I want the life
I want tonight
My fruits are labor I want 'em ripe
That's right private flight
Money get stacks to the highest height
Better get your math and science right
But I want the drama... Guiding light
I-i-i want the height but I don't believe it
I want it all but I know I don't need it
Man, I just want whats cool
And I want.. you

Pull over, that ass is too fat
Pull over, pull over, that ass is too fat
Pull over, pull over, that ass is too fat
That ass is too fat
That ass is too fat
C'mon
Pull over, pull over, that ass is too fat
Pull over, pull over, that ass is too fat
Pull over, pull over, that ass is too fat
That ass is too fat
That ass is too fat
C'mon
That ass too fat
Y'all ready for it
Yee oww
That ass too fat

Let's go

Hey
Hey
Hey
Yeap in the club, seem dead
Niggas can't play with them scared (scared)
Ying yang take it to the head (head)
B***h need a little more bread
Ying Ying Ying Yang
Lookin like a skank cause she's 'bout that thang
Tap them toes, Smack them hips
The truth from the heel got to pay bills
Big Big Big deal
All on the pole on the toes
Smack that honey, make that money make that money, jump that dummy
Pretty boy here to say (say), all the bills gotta be paid (paid)
In the booty club while you wait (wait)
To his old lady he say
He's got to...
Wild out (wild out)
Everybody with me drunk as fuck
Drunk as fuck
Wild out (wild out)
Everybody with me
Everybody with me
Wild out (wild out)
Everybody with me drunk as fuck
Drunk as fuck

Everybody with me drunk as fuck
Everybody with me drunk as fuck
Everybody with me drunk as fuck
Break it down and roll it up
Everybody with me drunk as fuck
Everybody with me drunk as fuck
Everybody with me drunk as fuck
Break it down and roll it up

Now come and kick it with the Twista
Black Caddy, Mack Daddy
With a hoe up in the back seat
With the '97 pimp flow
Gotta feelin when you smokin
When I flip it to a track speed?
Talkin about a beautiful figure
Astonishing as greek mythology
Body be just like a girl in uh..
What's that movie? nevermind
Let me enter your atmosphere
As you enter my world
And lemme touch that booty
I can't believe that your momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul
You need a modeling role
Still a playa know you got it
When you climbin from the bottom
To the top of that pole
Cause you can pop and control
Your fatty's so accurate
When I'm smackin it
It's makin me say
"What I gotta do to get with that?"
When it come to makin it rain
I can get it wet
When it come to cuttin the monkey
I can get it wet
You gone see me to ya baby
You need a better man
Here come the politics
I'ma be your weatherman
Cause everytime I'm lookin up
And I see your ass
I'ma constantly see
Rain in the forcast
This-a-way that-a-way
I'm flickin 5,000 ones
Or whatever you wanna call it
It's a celebration
You the champion
Here's the fetti confetti
Come on and get drunk
With the money hauler?

Walk, walk fashion baby
Work it
Move that bitch crazy
Walk, walk fashion baby
Work it
Move that bitch crazyEmbed
