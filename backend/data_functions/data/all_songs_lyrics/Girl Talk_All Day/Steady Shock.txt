Steady Shock Lyrics
Go shorty shorty go shorty shorty go
Go shorty shorty go shorty shorty go

Excuse me little mama
But you could say I'm on duty
I'm lookin' for a cutie
A real big o' ghetto booty
I really like your kitty kat
And if you let me touch her
I know you're not a bluffer
I'll take you to go see Usher
I keep a couple hoes
Like Santa I keep a vixen
Got that dasher, dancer, prancer
Dixen, comet, cupid, Donner, BLITZEN!
I'm hotter than 100 degrees
A lotta bread, no sesame seeds
If I'm in yo city
I'm signin them tig ol bitties
I'm plottin on how I can take Cassie away from Diddy
The girls want a Minaj
Yeah they wetta than a Rainmen
Usher buzz me in
EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND!

All the girls standing in the line for the Bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the Bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the Bathroom!
All the girls standing, All the
All the girls standing, All the
All the girls standing in the line for the Bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the Bathroom!
All the girls standing in the
All the girls standing in the line for the Bathroom!

Can't start a fire
(Oh yeah Oh)
You can't start a fire (oh, oh) without a spark
This gun's for hire

Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Hit her wit that flex

Hit her wit that flex
Hit her wit that flex
Hit her wit that
Hit her wit that flex

Hands on yo head while you workin' on the floor
You know, Lil' mama choosing
As I walk through the door
Gucci head to toe so you know
I'm getting chosen so watch me hit her with that flex
She go be begging for some more
Remix!

Hey my nigga we havin' a wonderful day and I won't fuck with me. Why?
'Cause it's the 1st of the month and now we smokin', chokin', rollin' blunts
And sippin' on 40 ounces thuggin' come come we got the blessed rum
From jumpin' all nights we high
Hit up the block to where? East 99
I get with my nigga to get me some yayo
Double up nigga what you need?
We got weed to get P.O.Ded
Fiend for the green leaves
Give it up it's the foe sure you better lay low
Cause the po-po creep when they roll slow
If you can't get away better toss that yayo
Keep your bankroll
Yeah we havin' a celebration, I love to stay high
And you better believe when it's time to grind
I'm down for mine crime after crime
Fin to creep to the pad cause mom's got grub on the grill
If we got the food, you know it's the 1st of the month
And my nigga we chills foe real
Wake up, wake up, wake up it's the 1st of the month
To get up, get up, get up so cash your checks and get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up it's the 1st of the month
To get up, get up, get up so cash your checks and get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up it's the 1st of the month
To get up, get up, get up so cash your checks and get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up it's the 1st of the month
To get up, get up, get up so cash your checks and get up
Who the fuck are y'all
Who the fuck are
Who the fuck are
Who the fuck are y'all (y'all, y'all y'all)

Who the fuck are y'all
Who the fuck are
Who the fuck are
Who the fuck are y'all (y'all, y'all y'all)
Bottles on me
Long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck y'all thinking
Making sure the young money ship is never sinking
Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these n'ggas
All I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
Super good smidoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them, but fuck it me either
But point the biggest skeptic out I'll make them a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I've done it throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahh

Who run it
Bitch I run it
Who run it
Bitch I, bitch I run it
Who run it
Bitch I run it
These niggas got plenty anna
But they ain't got plenty guns
I'm bustin' out of luxury cars
Still got these hoes on the run
I'm hearin' plenty many words
But ain't no actions to prove
We can do some straight war for war
We can do some stickin' and movin'
We can meet in the middle of these streets
Or in the middle of this ring
I can pop your chest, plastic Glock
Or pop your jaw diamond ring
Please don't hate me hate the bank
For Stashin' G's that I take
Or hate my shiny wristband, and big ass rims I rotate
These bitches ain't runnin'(runnin'), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater getin' tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin'(runnin'), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater getin' tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin'(runnin'), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater getin' tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin'(runnin'), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater getin' tossed out (tossed out)
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?Embed
