Triple Double Lyrics
I'm a-a diva, I'm a, I'm a-a diva
I'm a, I'm a-a diva, I'm a, I'm a-a diva
I'm a, I'm a-a diva, I'm a, I'm a-a diva
I'm a, I'm a-a diva, I'm a, I'm a-a diva

Oh! Yeah!
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans
Baby pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen I done befo'
A lot of, women, drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Befo' you make it big, there's just one thang that I gotta know
(Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it)
How low can you go? How low can you go?
(Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it)
How low can you go? How low can you go?
(Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it)
How low can you go? How low can you go?
(Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it)
How low can you go? How low can you go?
Now go'on drop it to the ground
Yeah drop it to the ground
Now go'on drop it to the ground
Yeah drop it to the ground

You dig?
A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Mil-A Mil
A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Mil-A Mil
A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Mil-A Mil
Mack, I'm going in
A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Mil-A Mil
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Motherfucker, I'm ill
Yeah!
A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Mil-A Mil
A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Mil-A Mil
A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Mil-A Mil
A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Milli, A Mil-A Mil
I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill, I' ill
I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill, I' ill
Motherfucker, I'm ill

Money from the trap house, beef pull the Macs out
Stuntin’ pull the 'llacs out
In case you cats doubt
I’m don’ everythang I rap about
And that’s on everythang
Standin’ on the club couch
On the corner thugged out, bitches pull they tongues out
I pull them one’s out
I’m doin’ everythang I rap about
And that’s on everythang
Hold up

Hey! Hey! Hey! Ayy!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey! Ayy!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', "Will I live another twenty-four?"
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
"Which park are y'all playin' basketball?"
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day
Get 'em, ugh, Get 'em, ugh
Get 'em, ugh, I got em
Get 'em, ugh, Get 'em, ugh
Get 'em, ugh, I got em

I whip my hair back and forth

Yeah! Uh-huh!
Black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow
Black and yellow black and yellow (One Two Three Four!)
Uh, black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it, but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club, look at them hoes' face
Hit the pedal once, make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roarin'
It’s the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, I’m ballin' out on every level
Hear them haters talk, but there’s nothin' you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: "That's nothin'!"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Uh-huh!
Yeah! Yeah! Uh-huh!Embed
