Brain Shake Lyrics
Alright, hold tight
I really want to ball tonight
On a bender, no space defender
A joy on the floor, I get it tight
Toe-to-toe with a black widow
Fee-fi-foe, smell the blood of rock 'n' roll
All out drive on a rockin' suicide

My feet are jumping, she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, a joy to ride
She's a joy to drive on a rocking suicide

It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
All I can take
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake

She's a mean, lean rockin' machine
A hip-hugging blue jeaned dream
She's a woman worth giving
A sweet sweet kissin'
Lips are running 'round on me
Well, it's a toe-to-toe with a black widow
Fee-fi-foe, smell the blood of rock 'n' roll
All out drive on a rocking suicide
My feet are jumping, she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, joy to ride
She's a joy to drive on a rocking suicide

Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Ready to shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake

'Cause she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, joy to ride
She's an all out drive on a rocking suicide
It's a shake


Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Ready to shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Don't have to beg
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
You can't fake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Well it's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain
It's a brain
It's a brain
