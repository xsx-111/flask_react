Guns for Hire Lyrics
The word is out that I'm about
And I'm comin' gunning for you
I'm a real entertainer, a mischief maker
A lover of no fixed abode
Ooh, quick draw on the floor
No law, give you more
Sweet talkin' lover of sin
You want what you got
You get what you want
Look out woman

I got guns for hire
Shoot you with desire
The gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire

On a wanted poster, a needed man
Runnin' right across the land
I'm a smooth operator, a big dictator
Gonna mark you with my brand

My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
Got guns for hire
Shoot you with desire
Quick draw
On the floor
Big shot

Stick 'em up!

Hot to trot, big shot, take the lot
Never get the drop on me
I'm a real entertainer, mischief maker
Love in seven languages

My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
This gun's for hire
I shoot you with desire
My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
A gun for hire
Shoot you with desire

What you got, big shot?
You can't get
You can't get the drop
On me2Embed
