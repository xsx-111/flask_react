This House Is On Fire LyricsYonder she walk
Yo!

Yonder she walk
Hitting 1-0-3
A little tongue-in-cheek
Hot poisonality

She bring on the flames
And it's burnin' and burnin'
My body's achin', tossin' and turnin'

House is on fire
House is on fire
This house is on fire
And my flame is gonna burn in
You

She got me runnin' for shelter
Needin' quarantine
She got me red hot and wired
Call on emergency


You got me burnin' and burnin'
You got me tossin' and turnin'

Ya got me burnin'

This house is on fire
House is on fire
This house is on fire
House is on fire
This house is on fire
This house is on fire
House is on fire
And my flame is going to burn in
My flame is gonna burn
Yeah, I'm gonna burn you1Embed
