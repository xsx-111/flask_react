Bedlam in Belgium Lyrics
The blood in my veins
Was running right through my brain
There was a cop with a gun
Who was running around insane

Three-fifty arrests
No bulletproof vest
Now ain't that a shame?
We wanted to play
Play for the crowd
Law said, "No way, 'cause you're on your way out"

Bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium

The place was a-jumpin'
And the booze was goin' down
There's a curfew in town
You'll be working overtime

We don't play just for pay
So we'd like to stay
Stay just the same
He gave me a crack in the back with his gun
Hurt me so bad I could feel the blood run
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium, yeah

Who's to blame?
It's a shame


Bedlam
In Belgium
It was bedlam
Yeah
Get it ready

Stayed on the stage, cops in a rage
Crowd yelled for more, it was war, war, war

Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam (in Belgium)
It was bedlam (in Belgium)
It was bedlam
And the law got the drop on
