Flip Flop and Fly LyricsWell now, when I get the blues, gonna get me a rockin' chair
Well now, when I get the blues, gonna get me a rockin' chair
When the blues overtake me, gonna rock right away from here
Now when I get lonesome, I get on the telephone
Now when I get lonesome, I get on the telephone
Well, I call my baby, tell her I'm on my way back home
Well, flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye
Give me one last kiss, hold it a long, long time
Give me one last kiss, hold it a long, long time
Well, hold that kiss till I feel it in my head like wine
Well, here come my baby, flashin' a new gold tooth
Well, here come my baby, flashin' a new gold tooth
Well, she's so small she can mambo in a pay phone booth
Well, flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye
Lou Marini
Like a Mississippi bullfrog, sittin' on a hollow stump
Like a Mississippi bullfrog, sittin' on a hollow stump
I got so many women I don't know which way to jump
Well, flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbyeEmbed
