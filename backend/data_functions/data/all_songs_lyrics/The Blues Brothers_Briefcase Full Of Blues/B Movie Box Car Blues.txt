B Movie Box Car Blues LyricsCaught a ride into South Dakota
With two girls in a light blue Desoto
One's name was Jane, the other was plain
But they both had racing motors
Next I caught a ride with a gamblers wife
She had a brand new Rambler
She parked on the other side of town
Laid the Rambler down
She said she could dig if I'd knew her
I'm doing my best to get back to you
Ain't nothing I'd rather do
Look for me Sunday, gonna be there, honey
Something special just for you
(Special just for you)
Made a truck stop for toothpickin' water
Got a ride from a fruit pickers daughter
Drove her through the night, let the fruit just right
She said, all I could eat for a quarter
Next, hopped a train with a hobo woman
Said she's from Texas too
The way that she did, what she did, when she did
What she did to me made me think of you
Hey honey, made me think of you
Doing my best to get back to you
Ain't nothing I'd rather do
Look for me Sunday, gonna be there, honey
With something special just for you
(Special just for you)
Yeah honey, something special just for youEmbed
