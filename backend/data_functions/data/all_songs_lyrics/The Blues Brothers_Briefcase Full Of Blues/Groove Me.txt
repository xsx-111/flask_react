Groove Me LyricsHey there, sugar darling
Let me tell you something
Girl, I've been trying to say
You look so sweet
And you're so, so doggone fine
I just can't get you out of my mind
You come a sweet taste in my mouth now
And I want you to be my spouse
So that we can live happily now
In a great big old roomy house
And you know you gotta groove me, baby, oh yeah
Well you make me feel good inside
Come on now groove me, baby
I need your groove, hey
Hey there, sugar darling
Let me tell you something
Girl, I've been trying for days
Gimme some lovin'
And some 20/20 huggin'
Ooh, you cute little thang
Well girl, between you and me now
We don't need no company
No other man, no other girl now
Can enter into our world
Not as long as you groove me, baby, oh yeah
Make me feel good inside
Come on and groove me, baby
I need your groove, hey
His majesty
I need some lassie
Groove me, baby
I need your groove, hey
Groove me, baby
Ow, hey heyEmbed
