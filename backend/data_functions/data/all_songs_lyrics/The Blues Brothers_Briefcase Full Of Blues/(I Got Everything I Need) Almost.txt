(I Got Everything I Need) Almost LyricsI got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
But I don't got you
And you're the thing I need the most
I got a car that I bought
Won't get me far
Gotta wish on a star
Tell me, mama
Got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
But I don't got you
And you're the thing I need the most
I got friends who like me
'Cause I got lots of dough
The people recognize me
Wherever I go
I don't got trouble gettin' high
But if I don't get you, I believe I will die
I got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
But I don't got you
And you're the thing I need the most
I got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
But I don't got you
And you're the thing I need the mostEmbed
