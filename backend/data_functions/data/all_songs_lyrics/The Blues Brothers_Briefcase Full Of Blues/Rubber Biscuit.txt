Rubber Biscuit LyricsBow bow bow...
Um, do that again
Bow bow bow...
Have you ever heard of a wish sandwich?
A wish sandwich is the kind of a sandwich where you have two slices of bread and you
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Wish you had some meat
Bow bow bow...
Hmm
The other day I had a ricochet biscuit
A ricochet biscuit is the kind of a biscuit that's supposed to bounce back off the wall into your mouth
If it don't bounce back
Hmm, hmm, hmm
You go hungry
Bow bow bow
Hmm
The other day I had a cool water sandwich and a Sunday-go-to-meetin' bun
Bow bow bow
Hmm, hmm, hmm
What do ya want for nothing?
R-r-r-r-rubber biscuit?
Bow bow doo doo dooEmbed
