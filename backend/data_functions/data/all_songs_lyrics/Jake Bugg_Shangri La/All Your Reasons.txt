All Your Reasons Lyrics
Got all of your reasons
And all of them's been used
Read a lot about it
You can read up in the news
There's a lot of hungry faces
There's a lot of pain out there
Oh anyway, it's been a long day
Oh anyway
Didn't disappoint you
Didn't want to make you sad
Given all the choices
Good's given from the bad
There's a lot I need to tell you
There's a lot you should know
Oh anyway, it's been a long day

So if I keep myself moving on
Oh angel, angel, angel will fly
Because it's my heart's desire
To set the world on fire
Oh angel, angel
Angel will fly to the moon
]
Summer's almost gone
And I'll be singing all the songs
I've heard all the excuses
And all have been refused
I've read a lot about you
You can read up in the news
There's a lot of fairy tales
While it's a cold world outside
Oh anyway, It's going to stay that way
