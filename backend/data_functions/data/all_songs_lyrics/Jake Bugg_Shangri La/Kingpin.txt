Kingpin Lyrics
I wake up, check my phone
Jump in my whip, and off I go
I pay off the police to stay out of my way
I got it all sewn up
And I'm kingpin for a day

I got the blues, I got the reds
Yellowtops, and spiderlegs
You'd swear it's from heaven
But it all grows naturally
I got it all right here
And I'm kingpin for a day

When you're the kingpin
All the eyes are on your crown
When you're the kingpin
People want to take you down
When you're the kingpin
Nobody can show, nobody can show
Nobody can show you how

Don't want no trouble
But when trouble comes
I know a guy, who gets it done
He'll serve it right up to you on a rusty tray
I don't care about tomorrow
I'm kingpin for today
