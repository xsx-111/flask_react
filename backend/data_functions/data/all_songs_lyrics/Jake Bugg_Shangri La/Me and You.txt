Me and You Lyrics
All the time people follow us where we go
We both should believe the path we chose
And I hold you in such delicacy
No they won't catch you and me

It's all over, all of the time
And if you want to, I won't mind
Please don't leave it, I don't know what to do
No they won't catch me and you

There are too many flashes
And Gordon's around me
There's so little time and places to see
And we can wait so patiently
No they won't catch you and me


All of these people who want us to fail
I won't let that happen now
Just you believe me I'll hide you discretely
Discreetly from this cruel world
It's all over all of the time
And if you want to, I won't mind
Please don't leave it
I don't know what to do
No they won't catch me and you
No they won't catch me and you
No they won't catch me and you1Embed
