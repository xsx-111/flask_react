Kitchen Table Lyrics
I wrote this song by your kitchen table
Maybe it all seems okay
Sometimes it's better just to laugh than to run away
Maybe I'll leave you in the coming winter
And all of your dreams soon fade away
Sometimes it's better just to run than to play your game
When we were laying down
And you held my hand
Amongst the opal flowers
When we sat outside

And I see it's over now
We just grew out of love

Out from the darkness
Your heartlessness haunting my future
Down on all fours
You bark bright at the descending moonlight

You'll be with the rest of the lonely people
Ones who live in a cold dark place
Sometimes it's better just to run than to face the pain
I've not been seeing you for some time now
And still you choose to hold my hate
But after how I handled it you're hardly to blame
I feel you read my mind
And look through my soul
As our love grew fainter
And your face grew wetter


All of the rest of our days together
I may have never seemed the same
Sometimes there's nothing we can do when we all change
And now my hearts in two
Not a half for you
Another situation
Now the mornings golden
