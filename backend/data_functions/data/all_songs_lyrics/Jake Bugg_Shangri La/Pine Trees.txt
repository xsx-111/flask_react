Pine Trees Lyrics
You can walk in the pine trees
You can sit down
You can hold the earth in your hands
You can run from all this
You can go the long way
You can carry my weight the whole way down

As the crow flies straight
Holds me in his gaze
As he rises to his fate
We can do the same

I try not to visualize other people's eyes
And their compromising ways
And as I leave them far behind
I try to hide the route of my escape

You can sit in the pine trees
You can sit alone
You can breathe a sigh of silence in the woods
You can bawl your heart out
Make your feelings known
Things the grass already knows
As the crow flies straight
Holds me in his gaze
As he rises to his fate
We can do the same

I try not to visualize other people's eyes
And their compromising ways
And as I leave them far behind
I try to hide the route of my escapeEmbed
