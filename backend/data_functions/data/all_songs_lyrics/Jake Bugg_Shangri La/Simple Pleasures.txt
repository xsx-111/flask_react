Simple Pleasures Lyrics
You've been hunting around for treasure
Find it all in the simple pleasures
I don't understand this life you lead
Trying to be somebody else and
Trying to be the one's who help
Want to find the one who helps you breathe

Maybe it's all a big mistake
And you live on all you take
From the lives that have always been close
I've been roaming around for hours
Singing all your songs of praise

How on earth can I complain?
How in hell can I be safe
From this sudden fear of change?
This sudden fear is strange

Trying to understand your ways
You hide them with convulsive rage
You tried to be the best you could be
People finding the most pleasure
All within the smallest treasures
This don't seem possible to me
And maybe it's all that you've done wrong
So just bite your silver tongue
That you lied with, lied to yourself
I've been roaming around for hours
Singing all your songs of praise

How on earth can I complain?
How in hell can I be safe
From this sudden fear of change?
This sudden fear is strange


You've been hunting 'round for treasure
Find it all in the simple pleasures
I don't understand this life you lead

Maybe it's all a big mistake
And you live on all you take
From the lives that have always been close
I've been roaming around for hours
Singing all your songs...
...while standing at the edge, about to fall
Faces crushed against the wall
The sudden fear of singing all your songs of
Staring into space I hear the sound
From a voice that's never found
The sudden fear is strange

But maybe it's all a big mistake
And you live on all you take
From the lives that have always been close
I've been roaming around for hours
Singing all your songs of praise

How on earth can I complain?
How in hell can I be safe?
This sudden fear is strange
This sudden fear of change14Embed
