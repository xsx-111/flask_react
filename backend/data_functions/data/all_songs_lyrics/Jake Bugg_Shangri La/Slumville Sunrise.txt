Slumville Sunrise Lyrics
The wind keeps beating on my window
I haven't slept all night
That drum just keeps on banging
They must be buzzing out their minds
Like bees in a hive
Tell me when the morning arrives

This place is just not for me
I say it all the time
My friends they just ignore me
Tell me never mind
Waiting all your life
On a slumville sunrise

Slumville sunrise
Nobody cares or looks twice
Shine away in the morning
Across this place where I was born in
Every bruise, every flower
Illuminated by the dawning

My face upon the concrete
The dirt is in my mouth
I clench my fists and feet
I'm trying to cry out loud
Make a sound
But something is keeping me down
This place is just not for me
I say a thousand times
My friends they just ignore me
Tell me never mind
Waiting all your life
On a slumville sunrise

Slumville sunrise
Nobody cares or looks twice
Shine away in the morning
Across this place where I was born in
Every bruise, every flower
Illuminated by the dawning


This place is just not for me
I say a thousand times
My friends they just ignore me
Tell me never mind
Waiting all your life
On a slumville sunrise
Slumville sunrise
Nobody cares or looks twice
Shine away in the morning
Across this place where I was born in
Every bruise, every flower
Illuminated by the dawning
Every bruise, every flower
Illuminated by the dawning5Embed
