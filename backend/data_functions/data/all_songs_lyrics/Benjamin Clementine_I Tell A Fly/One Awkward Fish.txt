One Awkward Fish LyricsOne awkward fish
Who remembers that one awkward fish?
One awkward fish
Who remembers that one awkward fish?
It played football
And after football
T'will dance on snow
When tire settled in
It could do anything but swim
(One Turkish boy)
(I too remember that one Turkish boy)
(One Turkish boy)
(I too remember that one Turkish boy)
I remember, whilst we fed Christ
His were weddings every fortnight
Now I wonder if he's broken free
And oh what rebels we were
Can't remember his name
As keys keeps the weeps in Illinois
Hope his tears are of nothing but joy
Oh, one Turkish boy from Camberwell
Hope you're doing very well
One Turkish boy from Camberwell
Hope you are doing very well
(One Turkish boy from Camberwell)
(Hope he is doing very well)
(One Turkish boy from Camberwell)
(Hope he is doing very well)
Turkish boy
Turkish boy
Turkish boy is an awkward fish1Embed
