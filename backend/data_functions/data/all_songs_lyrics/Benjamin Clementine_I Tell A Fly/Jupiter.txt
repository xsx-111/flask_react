Jupiter Lyrics
Ben is an alien with extra ability
Pushed time to next century
Somewhere his craft lost control
Guess where he stopped for petrol

Wishing Americana a happy
Wishing Americana free
Ben's an alien passing by
Wishing everyone be
Back home in Jupiter, things are getting harder
Wishing everyone ease

When I made a joke about shooting stars
Ben spoke like a true bard
Said: "Don't play with songs, music is not mocked
As fears toy tear joys"

Wishing Americana a happy
Wishing Americana free
Ben's an alien passing by
Wishing everyone be
Back home in Jupiter, things are getting harder
Wishing everyone ease
Could it be? Could it be? Could it be?
Could it be? Could it be? Could it be?
Can it be? Can it be? Already?
Can it be? Can it be? Already?
Can it be? Can it be? Already?
Can it be? Can it be? Already?
Can it be? Can it be? Already?
Can it be?1Embed
