God Save the Jungle Lyrics
(Once you get to England and now you have to give up)
(Yeah, yeah, give up)

Welcome to jungle, dear
Where tensions do amount
And kids must grow as quick as possible
Welcome to jungle, dear
Risk it on a tooth or bone
As you travel along, come and run run to the roads

Welcome to jungle, dear
Where lorries are chariots, railways are stairways
Stairways to heaven, Heaven is brightened
Oh alien, oh alien
Aliens on foreign land again
Better beat it and go back home
Cause if they find you they will kill ya!

God save
God save
God save
God save
Welcome to the jungle, dear (welcome to the jungle)
Jungle, dear (welcome to the jungle)
Jungle, dear (welcome to the jungle)
Jungle (welcome to the jungle)
Jungle
(Take all you need)
(Make sure you leave some behind)
(Welcome to the jungle)
(Welcome to the jungle)
(Welcome to the jungle)
Jungle, jungle

Hmmmmm
God save the jungleEmbed
