Ave Dreamer Lyrics(Going on and on an on
On and on and on
On and on and on and on
And on and on and on
For me... and for you)
Hail dreamer (x8)

Hey dreamer
Hey dreamer
Hey dreamer
How are you
Since dreams can be
What will you want to be?
"Well I'll be a dragonfly"
Said the bumblebee
"How about you, housefly?"
Asked the horsefly
"Well give me a flying horse
And I'll be satisfied"
Hail Dreamer (x8)

Hey dreamer
Hey dreamer
I'm sorry for interfering with your presence
So we've been told
We're currently in existence
Centuries are coming
As pleasantries linger on
I am sure you're aware
Of the current happenings
So we've been told
We've got to do the dancing
Chance the rhythm of heartbeats
Chance and chance 'till beat end
So how do I describe it then?
They say I'm a boy and you're a girl
We laugh some, hate some
And that's about it really
(Barbarians, barbarians, barbarians)
(Barbarians, barbarians, barbarians)
The barbarians are coming!
(Dreamers, dreamers, dreamers)
Will the dreamers stay strong?
(Dreamers, dreamers, dreamers)
(Barbarians, barbarians, barbarians)
Barbarians are coming!
(Barbarians, barbarians, barbarians)
The barbarians are coming
(Dreamers, dreamers, dreamers)
But will the dreamers stay strong?
(Dreamers, dreamers, dreamers)
Will they?
Hail Dreamer (x8)Embed
