Phantom of Aleppoville Lyrics
(we won't leave you alone, we want you to die, we won't leave you alone)
Oh leave me, oh leave me, oh leave me, leave me
Oh love me, oh love me, oh love me
Oh leave me, leave me, oh leave me, leave me
Oh love me, oh love me, leave me alone

O Billy the bully
Come on out of your hideout
Billy the bully, it's alright
You've been forgiven
Come on now Zacchaeus
Come down from your sycamore tree
Where guns sing, roses are found dancing

For me the difference between love and hate
Weighs the same difference between risotto and rice pudding
And the difference between a dog and a stranger
Weighs the same difference between children and bullying
Some say, they wonder why you bullied me, but I laugh
'Cause I know that you know that we will never never know why they hate the bullyings
Oh Billy (final balance, final balance)
It's forgiven
Billy bully, bully Billy
It's alright
No, it's fine

No, if the supremacy will come in, now congratulations
Let's hope as the growing grows we'll be able to handle

Billy the bully
Once a serious case
Twice a forgiven case
Wonderings are never ending
The wonderings are never ending
The wonderings are never ceasing
The wonderings are never ending4Embed
