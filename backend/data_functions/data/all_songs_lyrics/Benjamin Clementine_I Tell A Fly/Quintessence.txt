Quintessence Lyrics
Somewhere beyond the iron fence
Lays the good heart of all men
But due to nature's bothering heights
A man must show no glimpse of gay nor fright

They say you must become an animal
For the animal to protect us
The good animal and so we go to war

I do agree, a deal
Of men are purely evil
For whereas I was born with a spoon in me mouth
Others are nurtured with a bullet in their hands

They say you must become an animal
For the animal to protect us
The good good animal and so we go to war

But I believe in the little bit of my young years
Of tasting fruits of fear in the depths of my own sorrows
Love is all I need to give
Although it clearly hasn't been dear to me2Embed
