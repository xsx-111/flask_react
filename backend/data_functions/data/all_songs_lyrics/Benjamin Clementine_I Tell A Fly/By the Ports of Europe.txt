By the Ports of Europe LyricsBy the Ports of Europe (x12)
By the Ports of Europe
A free lion is hungry
Buffaloes are coming
By the Ports of Europe
An eagle cries
Fish are multiplying
By the Ports of Europe
"Don't know why", said the wondering swine
Everyones a coming
Everyones a coming
Everyones a coming
By the Ports of Europe
(x3)
By the Ports of Europe
A thief whispers to princess:
"Should leave or stay, have we enough takes?"
By the Ports of Europe
"Don't know why", said the wondering swine
Porto bello (x36)
Oh,
Out of Ports of Europe (x4)
By the Ports of Europe (x4)
No, no, no I said
Out of Ports of Europe (x4)
(By the Ports of Europe) (x4)
A star twinkles not on a tree
But in front of a TV screen
One wonders when it will all end
By the Ports of Europe
For much of the day to mend
By the Ports of Europe (x8)2Embed
