Paris Cor Blimey LyricsPandemonium, whoa
Pandemonium, whoa
Paris' friend had a little pen
A little pen Paris' friend had
If Paris' friend had a little pen
Then where is the pen Paris' friend had?
Paris' friend kept her little pen
Everyday, under her little bed
One day, right before dawn she got up
Only to find that her pen was gone
And Paris' friend looked everywhere
Yet couldn't find it anywhere
There's a pandemonium, whoa
Pandemonium, whoa
Paris' friend got her little pen
From her daddy, before he left
He said, "Keep this, keep this very near,"
"This was passed on from your grandma"
They say life's worth not a penny
If you lose your pen-ey?
If Paris' friend had a little pen
Then where is the pen Paris' friend had?
Paris' friend went to her friend Paris
"Friend can you help me? I can't find me pen"
Then Paris looks in his friends eyes with a smile
And says
"It's the rats"
"Don't you know my friend? It's the rats"
"Just blame it, on the rats"
Got to pick 'em out
When you're in doubt
Got to pick 'em out
When you're in doubt
Got to block 'em holes
If you want 'em to go
Got to block 'em holes
If you want them to go"Embed
