Gimmie Mi Gun LyricsThe man can't say that Iah!
How the man mean I can't say that?
Then weh the police an' soldier deh deh for?
Then what when a gunman buck me up 'round the corner
And a police an' soldier no deh deh
Weh I a go use fe defend I-self, hmm?
According to what is going on in the world and society today
That motivate me to do this song, I say
(Thief a man, you're just a part of Babylon's plan) Yeah
I says (Thief a man, you'd even steal a Rastaman) Yeah, yeh-yeh
Gimme my gun, say me waan my gun
Gimme my gun, 'cause I nah run
Gimme my gun, say me waan my gun
Gimme my gun, 'cause my life can't done
According to what is going on today
You have a lot of man with gun
A so they say that no gun should be around
And when you take a stock Some man go to the ground
Gimme my gun, say me waan my gun
Gimme my gun, 'cause I nah run
Gimme my gun, make me defend myself
Gimme my gun, I don't wanna fall off the shelf yah
Gimme my gun, say me waan my gun
Gimme my gun, 'cause I nah run
(Thief a man, you'd even steal a Rastaman)
As hungry and as poor as we might be
We desire a good life
But according to all things is going on
We need some self defence, as I would say
Me say fe gimme my gun, say me waan my gun
Gimme my gun, 'cause I nah run
Gimme my gun, say me life won't done
Gimme my gun, 'cause I have life forever
But according to all things going on yah
It motivate me to do this musical song of today
That come on down along along along the long way
Gimme my gun, say me waan my gun
Gimme my gun, or me life will done
Gimme my gun, 'cause I nah run
Gimme my gun, make me defend myself
There is a lot of people out there
Who would defend theirselves if it come to a crisis
What happen if a man buck me up 'round the corner
And go for his gun an' stick!
Maybe you would have a chance to defend yourself
But I tell you say, you have to run
And the man run you down and gun you down
Me say fe gimme my gun, for me life will doneEmbed
