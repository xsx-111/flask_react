Ones Who Love You Lyrics
Take, take from the ones who love you, ooh
Leave, leave with the ones who don't, ooh
Lie, lie to the ones who like you
Lay, lay with the ones who won't

When lightning strikes
I will be on my bike
I won't be stuck inside
I will be taking flight

They, they are the ones who love you, ooh
We, we are the ones who don't, ooh
Hang up on the ones who need you, ooh
Watch out for the ones who won't

When lightning strikes
I'll be on my bike
I won't be stuck inside
I will be taking flight
And when the wheels come off
I'll be an astronaut
I will be lost in space
I will be skipping rocks
When you live on an island
Nothing ever falls in place
The winters are violent
And you can't ever feel your face
You can't fucking feel your face

And when lightning strikes
I'll be on my bike
I won't be stuck inside
I will be taking flight
And when the wheels come off
I'll be an astronaut
I will be lost in space
I'll be on Lippincott

Ooh
Take...3Embed
