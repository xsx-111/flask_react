You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me
Forget all the local police, we can find comfort in biology

We wrote our names on the overpass and I hope it lasts forever
Don't have to

You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me
Forget all the local police, we could findâ€”
If you don't want to, you don't have to11Embed
