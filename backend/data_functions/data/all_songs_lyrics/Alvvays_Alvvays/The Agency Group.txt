The Agency Group Lyrics
Parked outside of the agency
Wondering if you can sneak away with me
I'll admit, I've been losing sleep
Rifling through your toxicology

When you whisper you don't think of me that way
When I mention you don't mean that much to me
To me

An outcast of modern society
Suffering from a case of sobriety
Shortcomings, well, you can take your pick
When you are catering to one of your nervous tics

When you whisper you don't think of me that way
When I mention you don't mean that much to me
To me, to me

You know that it won't take much longer before it's wrong
You know that it won't take much longer now that I'll be gone
It's gone, the sun is gone
When you whisper you don't think of me that way
When I mention you don't mean that much to me
When you whisper you don't think of me that way
When I mention you don't mean that much to me
To me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me4Embed
