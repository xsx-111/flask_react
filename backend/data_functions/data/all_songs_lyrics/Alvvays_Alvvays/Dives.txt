Dives Lyrics
All the documents you keep
And the friends that never phone
Spend the winter in a Jeep
And your summer months at home

No love to share
So what?
Who cares?

Bleeding light into your room
Makes you cower beneath the sheets
Waste away all your days

No love to share
So what?
Who cares?

I've been waiting on our lives together
I've been patient for a long time
We've been hanging out in dives forever
We never get it on the first try
We never get it on the first try
We never get it on the first try
The first try
So what?
Who cares?4Embed
