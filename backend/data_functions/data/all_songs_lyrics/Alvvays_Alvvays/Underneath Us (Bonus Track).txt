Underneath Us (Bonus Track) LyricsSay the word
I'll be there
Close your eyes
Say your prayers
Seventeen
In a room
Recognize
Meet our doom
Something happening
Underneath everything
Something happening
Underneath us
Run away
Young regret
Don't depend
Don't forget
Something happening
Underneath everything
Something happening
Underneath us
Something happening
Underneath everything
Something happening
Underneath us
Underneath us
Underneath us
Underneath us
Underneath us1Embed
