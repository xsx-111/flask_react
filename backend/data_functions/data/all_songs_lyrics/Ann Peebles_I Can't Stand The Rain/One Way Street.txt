One Way Street LyricsThere's a troubled man, confused within
Stumbling in darkness because of sin
Slipping and tripping with somebody else's love
Taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
There's a sad heart all wrecked with pain
Look at the sad face, filled with shame
Walking on troubled ground where I don't belong
Taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
You know it's wrong, this way of living
Sometimes you have to take less than what you're giving
But right now I'm satisfied taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
Walking the wrong way on a one way street
Slipping and tripping with somebody else's love
Taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong, wrong, wrong
Wrong, wrong way on a one way street
Wrong way on a one way street
I walk in the wrong way where I don't belong
Slipping in darkness on a one way street
The wrong way where I don't belongEmbed
