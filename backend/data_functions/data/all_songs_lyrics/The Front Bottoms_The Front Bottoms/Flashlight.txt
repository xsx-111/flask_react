Flashlight Lyrics
Please fall asleep so I can take pictures of you
And hang them in my room
So when I'll wake up, I'll be like, "Yeah, everything's alright"
You are still here, you are still happy
You are still smiling and laughing
You are still the only thing and everything I need in my life
And it goes in, in, out through the mouth
Breathing exercises I will never figure out
So I am running in circles or (I am) walking in circles or
(I am) Crawling in circles or lying on the ground

And I...
Can hear your dog whistle
From my bedroom
Yeah, yeah
And I...
Can see a flashlight cuttin'
Up the trees behind my house
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

She says a lot of the kids we graduated with are now homeless
Which puts them in mad shady situations with mad shady people
If not every day, then on an every-other-day basis
And she's probably with a few of them right now
And they are probably just drinking and talking about
How she misses getting fucked up and hangin' around
And he says "Hey, you're good at that"
And she says "Thanks, it's kind of all I got"
And then she looks away and says, "It's also all I need"
And I can smell plastic burning
I can smell chemicals breaking down
I got your last three emails, the ones where you said
"I was sorting some things out"
And he will be able to hear her dog whistle
From his bedroom
Yeah, yeah
And I
Can see a flashlight cuttin'
Up the trees behind my house
Yeah, yeah

And I will read the flashing
Like a Morse Code explanation
That will mean nothing
But take all night to figure out, out, out

When I am sad, I am sad
But when I am happy, oh God, I'm happy
(Please fall asleep so I can take pictures of you
And hang them in my room)
There's just no place in between for us to meet
(So when I'll wake up I'll be like
Yeah everything's alright)
When I am sad, I am sad
But when I am happy, oh God, I'm happy
(You are still here, you are still happy
You are still smiling and laughing)
There's just no place in between for us to meet
(You are still the only thing
And everything I need in my life)
When I am sad, oh God, I'm sad
But when I'm happy, I am happy
(Please fall asleep so I can take pictures of you
And hang them in my room)
And there's just no place in between for us to meet
(So when I'll wake up I'll be like
"Yeah, everything's alright")
When I am sad, oh God, I'm sad
But when I'm happy, I am happy
(You are still here, you are still happy
You are still smiling and laughing)
And there's just no place in between for us to meet
(You are still the only thing
And everything I need in my life)
("I'm sad")14Embed
