Mountain Lyrics
I am climbing
Up this mountain
So I can ride my skateboard
Right back down it
But first
I am digging myself out of this hole
I love your eyes
The way they look when you're uncomfortable

I bought fireworks
A big bag in Pennsylvania
I'm gonna light 'em up
When I get home to Jersey
They'll probably arrest me
They'll probably ruin my whole summer
Stop taking pictures with your phone
Stop taking pictures with your phone

The door sounded
When she shut it
As if she didn't
Really have to leave
She just needed
A separator
She needed
Something in between
I bought fireworks
A big bag in Pennsylvania
I'm gonna light 'em up
When I get home to Jersey
They'll probably arrest me
They'll probably ruin my whole summer
Stop taking pictures with your phone
Stop taking pictures with your phone


I bought fireworks
A big bag in Pennsylvania
I'm gonna light 'em up
When I get home to Jersey
They'll probably arrest me
They'll probably ruin my whole summer
Stop taking pictures with your phone
Stop taking pictures with your phone1Embed
