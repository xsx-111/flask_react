Legit Tattoo Gun Lyrics
My head has thoughts
What a ridiculous place to start
She said, "Well, how about my chest?
Or, more specifically, my heart?"
Whenever I'm alone or feeling lonely
I pretend I can play the drums inside my head
And I am good
I love these songs, they love my songs

But I am not a dirty god
And I don't have a dirty body
And I am alone only half of the time
The other half, I am only hiding
And she was getting high
Yeah, she was smoking pot
I'm pretty sure that I am the only guy she's hooked up with tonight
But probably, oh, probably not

Oh...

Who did I think I was?
Who did I think that I could be?
Oh, how dare me
Oh, how dare me
And there's a voice in the back of my head
In the back of my head, says, "Let 'em be
Just let them be happy."
I'm gonna go crazy

I am the water
In the puddle in the shade of a tree
When I freeze over
You are the sun, you cannot touch me (Touch me)
And the tree feels bad
I can tell by the way that it felt
But it still won't move
So the ice won't melt
No, it still won't move
So the ice won't melt

But I am not a dirty god
I don't have a dirty body
And I am alone only half of the time
The other half, I am only hiding

Keep my body alive
Keep my arms reaching out towards anyone

But I am not a dirty god
And I don't have a dirty body
And I am alone only half of the time
The other half, I am only hiding
And we were getting high
And I was smoking pot
I'm pretty sure I am the only guy she's hooked up with tonight
But probably, oh, probably not3Embed
