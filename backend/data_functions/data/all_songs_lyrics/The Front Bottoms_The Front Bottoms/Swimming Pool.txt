Swimming Pool Lyrics
There's comfort in the bottom of a swimming pool
I'm holding my breath for you
There's no doubt in my mind
That if you could, then you would try
To crack my ribcage open
And pull my heart right through


There's comfort in the bottom of a swimming pool
I'm holding my breath for you
There's no doubt in my mind
That if you could, then you would try
To crack my ribcage open
And pull my heart right through

But I'm a creature
Of a culture that I create
I'm the last one on the dance floor
As the chandelier gives way
And I am permanently preoccupied with your past
I've been around long enough now
To know that the good things never last
They never last
There's comfort in the silence of a living room
The TV is on for you
Hide in your basement
While your house burns down
Your teeth are loose inside of your gums
They will eventually fall out
Follow an orange extension cord
Under a carpet, to a closet door
Feeding the black light
That will someday make me very, very, very
Very, very rich

But I'm a creature
Of a culture that I create
And I'm the last one on the dance floor
As the chandelier gives way
And I am permanently preoccupied with your past
I've been around long enough now
To know that the good things never last
They never last
How low is your self esteem?
How low could it possibly be?
And I know, I know, you're in love with me
And I've been ignoring you
I will stop cutting my pants into shorts
I will address the issues I cannot ignore
And I will do the things I think you might like
And I will be alone, probably the rest of my life
"What the fuck is wrong with you?"
"Breaking up with you. Done. Bye."
