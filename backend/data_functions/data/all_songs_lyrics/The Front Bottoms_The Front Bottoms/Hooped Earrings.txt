Hooped Earrings Lyrics
Hey, Bri. It's Mon. Um... Just calling to see if you'd talked to Mom at all, 'cause Mother's Day is coming up, uh..., and if you knew what you were gonna do for her! Uh... That's all, really. Just checking in. Um... Give me a call back when you hear this, and I will talk to you soon! Alright? Bye!
Come on, give me a break
What is the point if I stay?
There’s not that much I can say
I never really even knew your mom anyway
And now she’s crying in the bathroom
I’m standing on the back porch for support
And she is begging you not to cut your hair
'Cause curly hair don’t look good cut short

And you have gotta do this now
Or you can never come home again
Yeah, you have gotta do this now
Or you can never come home again, again

You've got a rash on your neck just below the line
Where at your shirt stops covering and leaves your skin bare
It’s such an unimportant detail
That has nothing to do with anything
But it's the only thing I remember
From when I cut your hair
And you have gotta do this now
Or you can never come home again
Yeah, you have gotta do this now
Or you can never come home again
And there are not so many options
There's not so many ways
That this could possibly end
So you have gotta do this now
Or you can never come home again, again



Say you have gotta do this now
Or you can never come home again
Yeah, you have gotta do this now
Or you can never come home again
And there are not so many options
There's not so many ways
That this could possibly end
So you have gotta do this now
Or you can never come home again, again5Embed
