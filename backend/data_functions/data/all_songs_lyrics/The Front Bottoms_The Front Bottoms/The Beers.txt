The Beers LyricsThere's beer in coffee mugs
Water bottles, and soda cups
And it's clear as the windows I came through
That you are in one of those moods
And I am in one of them too
And it's hard to communicate anything
And I will remember that summer
As the summer I was taking steroids
Because you like a man with muscles
And I like you
It's "The cops are coming in" type of sobering up
It's a girl who'll never learn that I could not give a fuck
My friends are happy, I am happy, I have learned to adapt
It's a darker kind of humor and I can still hear them laugh
And there's beer in coffee mugs
Water bottles, and soda cups
And it's clear as the windows I came through
And I will remember that summer
As the summer I was taking steroids
Because you like a man with muscles
And I like you
But it's an aerial view from your house to my room
Yeah, it's an aerial view from your house to my room
Look in your windows, and I am trying not to stare
Hold on to hope I'm sure was never even there
'Cause it's an aerial view from your house to my room
As the summer I was taking steroids
As the summer I was taking steroids
As the summer I was taking steroids6Embed
