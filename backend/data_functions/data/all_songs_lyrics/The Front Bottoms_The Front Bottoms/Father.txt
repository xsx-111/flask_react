Father Lyrics
I have this dream that I am hitting my dad with a baseball bat
And he is screaming and crying for help
And maybe halfway through, it has more to do with me killing him
Than it ever did protecting myself
And I believe that yeah, Dad, maybe no one is perfect
But I believe that you are pushing your luck
It just sucks it played out like this, a terrible movie
You can tell none of the actors even give a fuck

But you look good tonight, girlfriend
Can I sleep in your bed?
And when I crawl out in the morning
Can I stay inside your head?

'Cause you were high school
And I was just more like real life
And you were okay, okay as a girlfriend
But I was just more like his wife
I'll do the push-ups, I'll wear the makeup
I'll do whatever he wants all night
'Cause you were okay, okay as a girlfriend
But I was just more like real life
A long, long time ago, my great-great-great-great-grandfather
Took something that did not belong to him
And that is why today, I have an eagle in my veins
I am part Native American
And I am leaving as soon as I come
As soon as I come, you will probably forget my name
I hope I fall asleep at the wheel and crash my car
(On the way home) Or I could just stay here, because

You look good tonight, girlfriend
Can I sleep in your bed?
And when I crawl out in the morning
Can I stay inside your head?

'Cause you were high school
And I was just more like real life
And you were okay, okay as a girlfriend, girlfriend
But I was just more like his wife
I'll wear the makeup, I'll do the push-ups
I'll do whatever he wants all night
'Cause you were okay as a girlfriend
And I was just more like real life
More like real life (More like real life)
More like real life, more like real life

You were high school
And I was just more like real life
And you were okay, okay as a girlfriend, girlfriend
I was just more like his wife
And it is okay, I'll wear the makeup
I'll do whatever you want all night
'Cause you were okay, okay as a girlfriend, girlfriend
But I was just more like real life
More like real life3Embed
