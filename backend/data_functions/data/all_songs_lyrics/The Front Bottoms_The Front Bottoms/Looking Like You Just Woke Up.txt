Looking Like You Just Woke Up Lyrics
I love to wait
I love girls with ex-boyfriends, that they
Aren't really over
And I love New Mexico
I love places I've never been
I love the idea
Of places I'll never go

So I'm swinging like a fist fight
Concrete-colored basement
Alright, alright, let's keep this clean
As clean as you'd like
And it probably won't get easier
Just easier to hide
Prepare for an aching
The rest of your life

I'm playing dead
I faked my death and I'll keep pretending
If nothing else
For the sake of the tradition
And I am confident
Even if it makes no sense
I will say I love you back
To the love that I am given
So I'm swinging like a fist fight
Concrete colored basement
Alright, alright, let's keep this clean
As clean as you'd like
And it probably won't get easier
Just easier to hide
Prepare for an aching
The rest of your life
Prepare for an aching
The rest of your life
So I'm swinging like a fist fight
Concrete colored basement
Alright, alright, let's keep this clean
As clean as you'd like
And it probably won't get easier
Just easier to hide
Prepare for an aching
The rest of your life2Embed
