Rhode Island Lyrics
I wonder how that bike trip's going
I wonder if the government knows he’s hiding
It’d probably take a few more months
Florida’s a long way from Rhode Island
I watch her rest her hands inside her lap
I try to focus hard 'cause her eyes don’t make the frame
I try to work up the courage
To kiss the bottom half of her face

Amora cut her hair in Baltimore
Right before I left
I watch her sitting by herself, talking to herself
Breathing calmly, then try to catch her breath

Casanova just can’t turn the charm on
Or find any of the right vibrations
I know these women if he don’t wanna do it
Then they are probably just gonna make him
You can never tell when they're fucking around

Everything you’re feeling is common
Even though you've never felt so alone
I could probably catch a ride to your house
And borrow a bike to get back home
She says you got a promise not to break
No matter how far you are bent
She says, "I gotta shift my position
And try to get comfortable again"
We both choose the same tone
Mine was an alarm clock, ringing from a cellphone
Mouth the words to me so we can keep things quiet
And I’ll still know exactly what you mean

And it is probably just my friends fucking around
Yeah, it is probably just my friends fucking around
They never cut me any slack
It’s just my friends fucking around

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

And it is probably just my friends fucking around
Yeah, it is probably just my friends fucking around
Casanova just can’t turn the charm on
They never cut me any slack
It’s just my friends fucking around2Embed
