Bathtub Lyrics
I am washing my hair with soap
I am sitting down in the shower
It is this dirty type of clean
That keeps me trapped in here for hours
Still, I scrub and scrub until my body bleeds
Convince myself I am coming clean
Forget and ignore who I used to be
That kid is never coming back

Relax my muscles

All of a sudden, I am scared
All of a sudden, I can’t breathe
All of a sudden, I am nothing
In this moment, you are everything
She says, "Can you feel that?
Oh, what a marvelous sensation"
She says, "Could you please take me off speaker phone?
This is a private conversation"
And I am washing my hair with soap
Yes, I am washing my hair with soap
Yes, I am washing my hair with soap
Yes, I am washing my hair with soap
With soap
But there is air inside of my lungs
And it is keeping me afloat
He says his grandpa’s in the mafia
He is the nicest guy I know
So I will run and run, maybe drive my car, maybe
Look at me now, I have come so far
And I don’t know where my family’s from
But I’ve got this stereotypical temper I cannot shake

Relax all the muscles in my face

All of a sudden, I am scared
All of a sudden, I can’t breathe
All of a sudden, I am nothing
In this moment, you are everything
She says, "Could you feel that?
Oh, what a marvelous sensation"
She says, "Could you please take me off speaker phone?
This is a private conversation"
And I am washing my hair with soap
Yes, I am washing my hair with soap
Yes, I am washing my hair with soap
Yes, I am washing my hair with soap
With soap2Embed
