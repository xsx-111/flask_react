Maps Lyrics
There is a map in my room
On the wall of my room
And I’ve got big, big plans
But I can see them slipping through
Almost feel them slipping through
The palms of my sweaty hands
And I move slow
Just slow enough to make you uncomfortable

You say, "I hate you," you mean it
And "I love you" sounds fake
It's taken me so long to figure that out
I used to love the taste, I would do anything for it
Now I would do anything to get the taste out of my mouth

And you're so confident
But I hear you crying in your sleeping bag

But you were broken bad yourself
And you were mad as hell, you felt
If you had done anything with anyone else
It would have worked out so well
But you are an artist
And your mind don’t work the way you want it to
One day, you’ll be washing yourself
With hand soap in a public bathroom
And you’ll be thinking "How did I get here?"
"Where the hell am I?"
If the roles were reversed
You could have seen me sneaking up
Sneaking up from behind

She sees these visions; she feels emotion
She says that I cannot go, she sees my plane in the ocean
"And what about your friends?
Don’t you love them enough to stay?"
And I say, "If I don’t leave now
Then I will never get away"
Let me be a blue raft
On a blue sea, I’ll blend right in

There is a map in my room
On the wall of my room
I’ve got big, big plans
But I can see them falling through
Almost feel them slipping through
The palms of my sweaty hands
And I move slowly
Just slow enough to make you uncomfortable
But you were broken bad yourself
And you were mad as hell, you felt
If you had done anything with anyone else
It would have worked out so well

But you are an artist
And your mind don’t work the way you want it to
One day, you’ll be washing yourself
With hand soap in a public bathroom
And you’ll be saying, "How did I get here?"
"Where the hell am I?"
If the roles were reversed
You could have seen me sneaking up
Sneaking up from behind7Embed
