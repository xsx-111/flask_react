Bird on a Wire LyricsLike a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

Like a knight from an old fashioned book

And if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you. No, no
Like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He called out to meEmbed
