Joan of Arc LyricsNow the flames they followed Joan of Arc
As she came riding through the dark
No moon to keep her armour bright
No man to get her through this dark and smoky night
She said, "I'm tired of the war

You know I've watched you riding every day
And something in me yearns to win
Such a cold and lonesome heroine

To the one beneath the smoke
"Why, I'm fire," he replied
"And I love your solitude, I love your pride."
"Well then fire, make your body cold
I'm gonna give you mine to hold,"
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride
And deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of Joan of Arc
And high above all these wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress

And then she clearly understood

But must it come so cruel, must it be so brave?
