THC Lyrics

Drink more water

I'm gon' get you high
And hunnids down to low end crazy, I'm gon' get you high
Flawless gems, I'm no fugazi, I'm gon' get you high
And you ain't even gotta cop blunts
Nigga brought food for thought, so you ain't even gotta cop lunch
Bring it back like I'm gon' get you high
I'm gon' get you high
And hunnids down to low end crazy, I'm gon' get you high
Flawless gems, I'm no fugazi, I'm gon' get you high
THC, THC

Water is the most important natural component that we have today
It makes up our world, our bodies
It has the ability to destroy, and create
It is the healing component, THC

I'm gon' get you high
And hunnids down to low end crazy, I'm gon' get you high
Flawless gems, I'm no fugazi, I'm gon' get you high
And you ain't even gotta cop blunts
Nigga brought food for thought, so you ain't even gotta cop lunch
Bring it back like I'm gon' get you high
I'm gon' get you high
And hunnids down to low end crazy, I'm gon' get you high
Flawless gems, I'm no fugazi, I'm gon' get you high
