Talk Talk Lyrics
Stop what you're doing, let me hold you closer
Your head's so full of things, I need to know, uh
Switch off the TV, turn the lights down lower

Just pay attention, stop
Just pay attention, stop

Your body thrills me like electrocution
I love the feel of you, your quiet ocean
Don't go and mess it up with elocution

Just pay attention, stop
Just pay attention, stop

All your talk-talk, talk-talk
Talk-talk, talk-talk
Talk-talk, talk-talk
Talk-talk, talk-talk

Stop what you're sayin', let me just adore ya
My body loves ya, but my ears ignore ya
You just keep pickin' on things ya don't make sense
Your lips keep movin', but they make no sense
I hate this kind of thing
I hate the in-between
It's no use talkin' to you
Just pay attention, stop
Just pay attention, stop

All your talk-talk, talk-talk
Talk-talk, talk-talk
Talk-talk, talk-talk
Talk-talk, talk-talk

Just pay attention, stop your talk-talk, talk-talk
Just pay attention, stop your talk-talk, talk-talk
Just pay attention, stop your talk-talk, talk-talk
Just pay attention, stop your talk-talk, talk-talk

I think it's time we should let up
I think it's time we should get things straight
I think I might have been set up
I think I'm making a big mistake
I hate this kind of thing
I hate the in-between
It's no use talking to you
There's no way I can get through
All your talk-talk, talk-talk, talk-talk, talk-talk, talk-talk
Oh, I'm just walking on air
I can take care of myself
I don't want nobody else

Just pay attention, stop
Just pay attention, stop

All your talk-talk, talk-talk
Talk-talk, talk-talk
Talk-talk, talk-talk
Talk-talk, talk-talk

Just pay attention, stop your talk-talk, talk-talk
Just pay attention, stop your talk-talk, talk-talk
Just pay attention, stop your talk-talk, talk-talk
Just pay attention, stop your talk-talk, talk-talk

I hate this kind of thing
I hate the in-between
It's no use talking to you
There's no way I can get through
All your talk-talk, talk-talk, talk-talk, talk-talk, talk-talkEmbed
