Here Comes the Judge (Live) LyricsThis is our- This is our last song
It's called Here Comes the Judge and you all are gonna clap aren't ya?
What am I supposed to do?
Sitting here in this eternal zoo
With no shoes on
I broke all your records
And I played all your rules
I sold you down the road
I was nobody's fool in my schooldays - my schooldays
What am I supposed to feel?
Sitting here in this eternity wheel
With my frown on
Here come my friends / they're gotta help me pull through
Oh, help me out of this emergency room
With my suitcase - my suitcase
What am I supposed to learn?
Sitting here in this electrical storm
With no shoes on?
Hey mister, won't you leave me alone
I think I need to use your telephone
Call my lawyer, my liar
I took a walk in the park
I tried a kiss in the dark
I was trying to make you love me
I took an overdose
Of the perfume on your clothes
I was trying to make you happy
What am I supposed to say?
I didn't like her that much anyway
She was screaming
Here comes the Judge he's gonna help me pull through
Oh, help me out of this emergency room
With my suitcase - my suitcase
What am I supposed to do
Sitting here in this eternal zoo
With no shoes on
Hey, mama don't you cry over me
I'm lost and lonely but that's okay by me
That's just my way, just my way
Hey boy, this is your captain speaking
Got some very bad news from the crew
We all know where you going
And we all know where you've been
But you're in trouble boy, your tickets no good
Hey boy, this is your captain speaking
Got some very bad news from the crew
We all know where you going
And we all know where you've been
But you're in trouble boy, your tickets no good
What am I supposed to learn?
Sitting here in this electrical storm
With no shoes on
Hey mister, won't you hold my hand
I need a friend to find the promised land
Won't you touch me, please touch me
What am I supposed to do?
Sitting here in this eternal zoo
With no shoes on
Hey mister, won't you cry over me
I'm lost and lonely but that's okay by me
That's just my way, just my way
I took a walk in the park
I tried a kiss in the dark
I was trying to make you love me
I took an overdose
Of the perfume on your clothes
I was trying to make you happy
It's all right, It's all right, It's all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
It's all right, It's all right, It's all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
It's all right, It's all right, It's all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
It's all right, It's all right, It's all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
Hey boy, this is your captain speaking
Got some very bad news from the crew
We all know where you going
And we all know where you've been
But you're in trouble boy, your tickets no good
Hey boy, this is your captain speaking
Got some very bad news from the crew
We all know where you going
And we all know where you've been
But you're in trouble boy, your tickets no good
It's all right, (all right) all right, (all right), all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
It's all right, (all right) all right, (all right), all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
It's all right, (all right) all right, (all right), all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
It's all right, (all right) all right, (all right), all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
It's all right, (all right) all right, (all right), all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
It's all right, (all right) all right, (all right), all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
It's all right, (all right) zombie, (all right), all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
It's all right, (all right) all right, (all right), all right
I'm just a little bit zombie
Thank you goodnightEmbed
