Somehow Lyrics
I've seen it before
I know the score
You're trying to be wild and carefree
You really can't take it no more
I'm trying to think
I can't think clear
Everybody's talking at me
It's gone foggy in here

But as time goes marching home again
It leaves me to reflect
Or was this just a waste of time?
Or was this time well spent?
And if it marches back again
And orders me to smile
Then, will I be prepared?
Or will it take a little while?

Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow
I've listened to you
Please listen to me
Don't tie us up completely
Just wait and see
I'll try very hard for a second chance
Which is it to be? One dead romance
Or a handful of dreams? Please tell me
It makes all the difference to me
And I really want to know

I've tried so many things
I suddenly regret
If I could only compromise
And you'd try to forget
A single kiss, a lover's wish
The past dissolves in tears
The present burns inside of me
The future disappears

Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow
Oh yes, I will
And I'll go out of my way to make you happy
Till the sun don't shine, and the sky stops turning blue (O-o-oh)
I really want to know, could I ever be happy
Without somebody who really cared? Somebody like you (O-o-o-oh)

Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow

Yes, I willEmbed
