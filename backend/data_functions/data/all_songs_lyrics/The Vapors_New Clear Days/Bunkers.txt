Bunkers Lyrics
I could take another little ride in the country
Drive my mule down a lane or two
Maybe I'll recall what it was by the country
That made me so excited when I moved downtown
Or maybe, it's the noise in the streets and the car parks
Maybe it's the kids as they swarm around
Maybe it's the tires that they burn past my window
Or maybe, it's the corner where they all hang out

I got no idea where we go from here
Maybe that's why we're living in bunkers
I got no idea where we go from here
Maybe that's why we're living in bunkers
We're living in, we're living in
We're living in

I went down the road to see the end of the movie
'Cause I really like the part where the heroine dies
She takes away so many million secrets
But she tells just a few before she closes her eyes
I reckon that's the high and the low of my weekend
I reckon that's all the crazy wool they can pull
I reckon when tomorrow comes, I'll be normal
I reckon I may even go back to school
I got no idea where we go from here
Maybe that's why we're living in bunkers
I got no idea where we go from here
Maybe that's why we're living in bunkers
We're living in, we're living in
We're living in


Government thugs keep me in for the week
They call out the cops if I'm seen on the street
It drives me spoolers in millions of ways
I think I'll be a government thug one day
Don't tell me in anger, just tell me for real
Why does everybody try to be a real big wheel?
It doesn't matter, but if they live on the street
With all these cowboys and bunkers and creeps

I got no idea where we go from here
Maybe that's why we're living in bunkers
I got no idea where we go from here
Maybe that's why we're living in bunkers
We're living in, we're living in
We're living inEmbed
