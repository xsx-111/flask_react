America Lyrics
Why don't you get out of here?
I never needed you anyway
Why don't you just disappear?
I'm tired of driving down your logical motorways

You could stay, if you don't ask no questions
You could stay, if you don't tell no lies
You could stay, if you don't read my future
You could stay, if you don't read my mind

Wanna do something new?
W-w-w-w-w-wanna go to America?
Go to America? Go to America?
But I wanna stay with you
But I wanna take you too, baby
Baby, baby, baby

For a moment, I'm alive
Oh, everybody's tryin' to steal my sanity, yeah
God knows how I can survive
Just hiding out in this occupied territory
You could stay, if you don't ask no questions
You could stay, if you don't tell no lies
You could stay, if you don't read my future
You could stay, if you don't read my mind

Wanna do something new?
W-w-w-w-w-wanna go to America?
Go to America? Go to America?
But I wanna stay with you
But I wanna take you too, baby
Baby, baby, baby


Wanna go to America?
Go to America? Go to America?
But I wanna stay with you
But I wanna take you too, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, babyEmbed
