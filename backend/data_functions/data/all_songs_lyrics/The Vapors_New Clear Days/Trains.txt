Trains Lyrics
And again, I wait for you
My tired hands are turning blue
I'm not sure if it's night or day
My body's aching in the cold and rain
But I can't go home in case you're on the next train
So, here I stand, I'm just a-waiting for you

Everybody I know has to face the trains
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes

Playing games, I turn around
I kick my heels, I count the clowns
I watch another lonely man
Oh, but there's something in the air that says I'm in the right place
So, I gaze at the crowd, I'm trying to find the right face
And there it is, you say you're sorry too

Everybody I know has to face the trains
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes

Well, there's a hole in the ground that seems to eat me up
I can't say enough about the two of us
My arms are breaking, I can't hold you enough
No, I can't hold you enough, no, I can't hold you enough
I wanna love you again, I wanna love you again
I wanna love you again, I wanna love you again
I wanna love you again, I wanna love you again
I wanna love you again, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

Everybody I know has to face the trains
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes

Well, I took you to a glycerine party every night
I followed on my lead when you put out the light
I couldn't fight the feeling that is warmer than rain
I couldn't fight the feeling that you can't fight trains, 'cause I know

Nobody tastes like you
Nobody looks like you
Nobody loves like you
Nobody tastes like you
Nobody looks like you
I can't go home

I wanna do it again (All alone), I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again (All alone), I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again (All alone), I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again (All alone), I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

(What did you say?) I said a lot of things that I didn't mean
(Tell me why?) 'Cause I was hungry for your sweet 16
(So you lied?) Oh, just to keep you here, you're so naive
I get so lost and lame, I guess a ball and chain

I wanna do it again (All alone), I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again (All alone), I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again (All alone), I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again (All alone), I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

Everybody I know has to face the trains
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes

Don't let the trains get yaEmbed
