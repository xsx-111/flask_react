News At Ten Lyrics
Time's gonna make you a man someday
And you won't want to go out and play with your friends
You'll just sit at home and watch news at ten
And the pubs'll be closed and you won't have been with your friends

And he picks up the paper and appears to be quite serious
And you smile at him and agree 'cause he's your old man
But still, I can't hear you (Still, I can't hear you)
You make no sense to me
Still, I can't hear you (Still, I can't hear you)
When the time comes, I'll disagree with your policy, your policy

And you get home from work, about half-past six
You've been working real hard, and you feel real sick with the whole world
And your dinner's in the oven and it's all dried up
And your mom don't like it 'cause you messed her up for the evening

So, you pick up the paper and appear to be quite serious
And you smile at him and agree 'cause he's your old man
But still, I can't hear you (Still, I can't hear you)
You make no sense to me
Still, I can't hear you (Still, I can't hear you)
When the time comes, I'll disagree with your policy, your policy
Your policy, your policy

Time's gonna make you a man someday
And you won't want to go out and play
You'll just sit at home and watch news at ten
And the pubs'll be closed and you won't have been
And you get home from work, about half-past six
You've been working real hard, and you feel real sick
And your dinner's in the oven and it's all dried up
And your mom don't like it 'cause you messed her up
But you don't wanna sit tight, you don't wanna play it cool
You don't want a whole life like the first day of school
And I wanna fight wars, and I wanna die young
So, don't keep saying "Like father, like son!"
I can't hear you (Still, I can't hear you)
You make no sense to me
I can't hear you (Still, I can't hear you)
When the time comes, I'll disagree
But still, I can't hear you (I can't hear, still, I can't hear you)
I said you make no sense to a boy like me
I can't hear you (Still, I can't hear you)
Still, I can't hear you (Still, I can't hear you)
Still, I can't hear you (Still, I can't hear you)
Still, I can't hear you1Embed
