Prisoners Lyrics
There's someone banging on my wall
I turn the volume up to full
I don't know who it is, or why they don't like me
I don't feel safe in this street
There's something nagging in my head
I turn my body out of bed
I draw the curtains on another brand new day
Mrs. Jones and friend just look away

I'm prisoner number 1
I won't get parole  (Prisoner number 1) 'cause I carry a gun
I'm prisoner number 1
I'm prisoner number 1

We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners here

Last thing I remember Tuesday night
Is three white wonders, waiting for a fight
Mrs. Jones walked past me as I laid there on our street
She knows I'm a black boy underneath
I'm prisoner number 1
I won't get parole (Prisoner number 1) 'cause I carry a gun
Prisoner number 1
I'm prisoner number 1

We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners here

We're all prisoners, always caught
In the life and death of each other's thoughts
I'm prisoner number 1 (O-oh)
Prisoner number 1 (O-woah-oh)
Prisoner number 1 (O-oh)
Prisoner number 1

I'm prisoner number 1
I won't get parole (Prisoner number 1) 'cause I carry a gun (O-oh)
Prisoner number 1 (O-woah-oh)
Prisoner number 1

We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners
We're all prisoners here
O-o-oh
O-o-oh
O-o-o-ohEmbed
