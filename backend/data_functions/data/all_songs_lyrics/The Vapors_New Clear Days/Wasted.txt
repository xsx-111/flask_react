Wasted LyricsBy Dave Fenton
Don't think I told you 'bout this dream I had
Me and these friends of mine were feelin' bad
'Cause we were wasted
Wasted on the likes of you
?
Caucasian crucifix upon our backs
Yeah, we were wasted
Wasted on the likes of you
Well we've got powers in our jeans you've never dreamed
And we've got words you've never heard and never seen
Yeah, we've been wasted
I heard you hummin' on the telephone
I spoke to Monroe, Garbo, Truman, Capone
But they were wasted
Wasted on the likes of you
Oh, come along
Come along
Come along
Come along
I met a man today who sold me an ice cream
I took his number down in case we were seen
He looked so much better
I took my first real taste of porcupine tea
Loretta looked much better than you'd think she could be
She looked so much better
I really think she rule it out
I think I'll take a look at what I could be
She showed me lots of things that I'd never seen
'Cause she was wasted
Wasted on the likes of You
Maybe one day we can stop on the screen
And live off royalties from bein' obscene
Cause we've been wasted
Wasted on the likes of you, yeah, you, yeah
Wasted on the likes of you, yeah, you, yeah
Wasted on the likes of you, yeah, you, yeah
Wasted on the likes of you, yeah, you, yeah
Wasted on the likes of youEmbed
