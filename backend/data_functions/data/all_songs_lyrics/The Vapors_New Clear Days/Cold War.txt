Cold War Lyrics
Little white dogs in black and chains
Screaming indignation at your high-class games
Till the lights go out, shut your eyes and go back home
Cramped and shocked in leather jeans
Stoning priests and virgins 'cause they're much too clean
For your new machine, shut your eyes and go back home

'Cause you’ve been sitting up all night long
Lying and waitin' where you don’t belong
Shooting up strangers
And I’ve been coverin' up for you
Makin' up songs you can see right through
That someone’s in danger, think I'm in danger

You play left-handed for the revolution
You overestimate the quick solutions
But you’ll get there soon
Get ready for another Cold War, another Cold War, o-oh
Another Cold War, another Cold War, o-oh, o-oh

But you get let down when you ask for more
But you rescued me, so I won't stop this automatic fire
'Cause you’ve been sitting up all night long
Lying and waitin' where you don’t belong
Shooting up strangers
And I’ve been coverin' up for you
Makin' up songs you can see right through
Someone’s in danger, think I'm in danger

Is this a military state?
Is this a military state I’m in?
Is this a military state?
Is this a military state I’m in?
Is this a military state?
Is this a military state I’m in?
Is this a military state?
Is this a military state I’m in?
Is this a military state?
Is this a military state I’m in?
Is this a military state?
Is this a military state I’m in?
Is this a military state?
Is this a military state I’m in? I'm in? I'm in? I'm in?
Is this a military state?
Is this a military state I’m in?
