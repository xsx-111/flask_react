Sunstroke Lyrics
I've got a pain in my head
And the infection has spread
It's working onto my toes
I wanna spend my summer clothes
And there's a liquid on the floor
And it's the liquid I adore
It's got me crawlin' 'round for more
Because it's

Just another day in the sun
Just another day in the sun
Just another day in the sun
Just another day in the sun

And there's our favorite in the sand
I guess it must have been a man
I think I'd listen to the bough
And maybe stay there for right now
And there's a victim on the floor
And she's a victim I adore
But I can't help being bored

And so I spend a little time (Little time)
Taking photographs and drinking shitty wine (Shitty wine)
Just relaxing in the shape beneath the vines (Of the vines)
Slowly dozing to the sound of "My, oh my!" (My, oh my)
Then I make it closer, closer to the sea (To the sea)
It annoys me when a plastic's built like me (Built like me)
And it's sickness, baby
Just another day in the sun
Just another day in the sun
Just another day in the sun
Just another day in the sunEmbed
