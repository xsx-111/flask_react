Waiting for the Weekend Lyrics
It makes all the difference in the universe
To be with you at night, but it only makes it worse in the daytime
But when I see you in the evening, well, that's alright
I forget about the day 'cause you're mine all night
But in the morning, there's that feeling again
Another nine hours until I meet your train at the station
So I spend all day on the telephone
Just telling you I miss you, and I'm all alone

And every day I dream my life away
Just waiting for the weekend
Then, I know I won't have to leave you here
And we can be alone again
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend to come

I don't need money, and I don't need crime
I get my kicks from spending all my time here beside you
That's why I'm standing on the corner in the freezing cold
Just waiting for my girl from another world

And every day I dream my life away
Just waiting for the weekend
Then, I know I won't have to leave you here
And we can be alone again
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend to come

And every day I dream my life away
Just waiting for the weekend
Then, I know I won't have to leave you here
And we can be alone again
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend to come
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend
(O-o-ooh) Waiting for the weekend to comeEmbed
