Sixty Second Interval Lyrics
The moon is up, it's grey tonight
And the stars on the battlefield shiver in tears
A dead bright lesson from a million light-years
The game is up, it's cold tonight
So we crouch in our overcoats waiting for a dawn
Both hungry and simple and calm and warm

Sixty-second interval, here it comes
Sixty seconds, into view

They're out tonight, the masks are down
And friends meet strangers and strangers are friends
And pain is passion and passion must end
They're here tonight, no fear tonight
And the hands on the faces have started to move
It's slow at first but it's over too soon

Sixty-second interval, here it comes
Sixty seconds, into view

10, 20, 30
40, 50, 60
70, 80, 90
They're here tonight, no fear tonight
And the hands on the faces have started to move
It's slow at first, but it's over too soon

Sixty-second interval, here it comes
Sixty seconds in

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes
