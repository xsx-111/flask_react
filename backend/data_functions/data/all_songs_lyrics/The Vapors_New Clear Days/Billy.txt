Billy Lyrics
Billy was a landmine to his friends
He would never get excited to the end
You could see him in the corner there all alone
And if you see him on the street he says he's on his way home
But he don't go home
He's got his books to read
He's got his life to lead at night

We've been sitting round the tables far too long
And we've been making out that their was nothing wrong
Time is nothing when there's nothing left to say
And time goes slower when you're silent all the day
But he don't go home
He's got it all sown up
He's got his life to lead at night

He's forever on crossbars cycling home so his mama don't know
Billy's been bending some of their rules at the Saturday show
Come on Billy

Billy was a landmine to his friends
He would never get excited to the end
He built a city in his head and went and lived up there too
A man who knows made him an inmate in an urban zoo
But he don't go home
He's got it all sown up
He's got his life to lead at night
He's forever on crossbars cycling home so his mama don't know
Billy's been bending some of their rules at the Saturday show
Come on Billy

B-B-B-Billy
Billy
Billy, Billy Billy Billy


Don't ever change
Not even for a little while
Don't ever change
I love you just the way you are
I don't understand
I've never done a thing for you
Don't ever change
Don't ever stop to ask me too
Don't ask me too
Don't ask me too
Don't ever change
Not even for a little while
Don't ever change
I love you just the way you are
I don't understand
I've never done a thing for you
Don't ever change
Don't ever stop to ask me too
Don't ask me too
Don't ask me too
