You Were Right Lyrics
Started listening to your favourite band
The night I stopped listening to you
You were always trying to force my hand
But now I'm listening because I want to

You were right, I liked it
You were wrong, I was a good friend

Started eating at your favourite place
The night I stopped eating with you
You were always trying to force my taste
But now I'm eating there 'cause I want to

You were right, I liked it
You were wrong, I was a good friend to you

Twin hotel room, no bed to make
What can I do to change myself for your sake?
I don't want you here
You make me feel so small, I'm gonna disappear
Started feeling like myself again
The day I stopped saying your name
We can try and start it up again
But it's never gonna feel the same

You were right, I liked it
You were wrong, I was a good friend to you1Embed
