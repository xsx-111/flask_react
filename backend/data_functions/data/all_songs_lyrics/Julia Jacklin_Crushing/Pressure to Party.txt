Pressure to Party Lyrics
Pressure to party, gonna stay in
Nothing good can come from me drinking
I would run, shoes off, straight back to you
I know where you live, I used to live there too
Pressure to feel fine after the fact
Out on the dance floor with my body back
Meeting a stranger, touching his face
I don't want anyone to ever take your place
Pressure to go strike out on your own
Pressure to learn from being alone
Pressure to not leave it for too long
Before you find another heart where you belong

Pressure to come up with conversation
Makes the family fine with my isolation
I know I've locked myself in my room
But Iâ€™ll open up the door and try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
I, I, I

Pressure to act the right way around him
We're both in a crowd with people surrounding us
What do I do?
Don't know how it works
Pressure to not let the inside of my mind
Spill onto the floor for our friends to find it
Oh, what do I do?
'Cause God, how it hurts
Pressure to come up with reasons why
Sometimes it might look to you like I'm not even trying
I know I've locked myself in my room
But I'll open up the door and try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
I, I, I3Embed
