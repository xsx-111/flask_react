Good Guy Lyrics
Tell me I'm the love of your life, just for a night
Even if you don't feel it
Tell me I'm the love of your life, just for a night
Even if you don't mean it

I don't care for the truth when I'm lonely
I don't care if you lie
I don't care if in the morning
You get up, not say goodbye
I don't care for the truth when I'm lonely
I don't care if you lie
Come on, breathe in, breathe out
You're still a good guy

Tell me I'm the love of your life, just for a night
Even if you don't feel it
Tell me I'm everything that you could find
And you don't wanna waste it

I don't care for the truth when I'm lonely
I don't care if you lie
I don't care if in the morning
You get up, not say goodbye
I don't care for the truth when I'm lonely
I don't care if you lie
Come on, breathe in, breathe out
You're still a good guy
Tell me I'm the love of your life, just for a night
Even if you don't feel itEmbed
