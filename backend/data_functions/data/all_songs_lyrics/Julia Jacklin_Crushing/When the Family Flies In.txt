When the Family Flies In Lyrics
I was sitting in my Corolla
Talking to you while my friends drank inside
There was a silence, weak telephone reception
Doesn't compliment a dark state of mind

You know it's bad when the family flies in
Working bees back to the hive
You know it's bad when the family flies in
Just to stand by your side

Oh, the last thing that I sent to you
Was an irrelevant music video
And I'll always wonder if you ever watched it
Thought you had longer to go

You know it's bad when the family flies in
Working bees back to the hive
You know it's bad when the family flies in
Just to stand by your side, oh

Well, goodbye
Well, goodbyeEmbed
