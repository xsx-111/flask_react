Comfort Lyrics
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
You'll get well soon, sleep through the night
You'll go outside, enjoy the sun
Soon you'll feel fine to see everyone

He's gonna thrive, he'll be just fine
Hurt for a while, cured with time
Don't know how he's doing, but that's what you get
You can't be the one to hold him when you were the one
Who left

He's got good friends, they'll pull him in
Take him out dancing, help to begin again
Don't know how he's doing, but that's what you get
You can't be the one to hold him when you were
The one who left

Are you thinking of me too?
I was so happy all those years with you

I'll be okay, I'll be alright
I'll get well soon, sleep through the night
Don't know how you're doing, but that's what I get
I can't be the one to hold you when I was the one
