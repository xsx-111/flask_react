Head Alone Lyrics
Give me a full-length mirror
So I can see the whole picture
My head alone gives nothing away
Guess I could stand on a chair
Put it back by the table before you get there
My head alone doesn't know how to say

I don't want to be touched all the time
I raised my body up to be mine, hah

He said, "Give me another drink"
You know it's easy to talk when you don't have to think
Well, my head alone won't do it that way
Come on, give me the room tonight
You know I've told you before that you hold me too tight
And my head alone just wants to say

I don't want to be touched all the time
I raised my body up to be mine
Yeah, I don't want to be touched all the time
I raised my body up to be mine
I have your back
More than I have mine
I want you to feel good
All of the time

So I'll say it 'til he understands
You can love somebody without using your hands
Yeah, I'll say it 'til he understands
You can love somebody without using your hands2Embed
