Turn Me Down Lyrics
Learner driver
Going 80 k's
Tryna get to Melbourne
It's probably gonna take two days
Lover beside you
Gripping the door
Oh, you know why he is nervous
You have crashed before

It's a lot to ask of you
To believe in me
When I can't even promise
I'd do things differently next time

Pulled off the highway
Found a place to sit
He took my hand, said, "I see a bright future
I'm just not sure that you're in it"

It's a lot to ask of me
To believe in you
When I don't know if you'll ever love me
The way I want you to
So please just turn me down
Oh, please just turn me down
Why won't you turn me down?
Oh, please just turn me down
Why won't you turn me down?
Oh, please just turn me down
Why won't you turn me down?
Why won't you turn me down?

Don't look at me
Look at the centre line
Maybe I'll see you
In a supermarket sometime1Embed
