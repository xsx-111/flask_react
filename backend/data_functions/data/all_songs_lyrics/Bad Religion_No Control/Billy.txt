Billy Lyrics
I can recall the warm youth of a summer day, yeah
The sweetest lemonade, the darkest game arcade
And Billy had a yearning in the corner of his mind, yeah
It moved him secretly, it moved him powerfully
But prescience was lacking and the present was all
And his aptitudes were carelessly wasted
And challenging life with the abandon of a fool
He squandered the hours of his day, yeah

Then darkness and disorder slapped him sharply in the face, yeah
It hit him like a friend, struck something deep within
He couldn't break the chain of slow decay that seemed to drag him
Just like a fatal tie, toward the other side
And Billy was a lunatic just barking at the moon
And his brain was totally wasted
He then exchanged his friends for a needle and a spoon
And he threw his future away, yeah

Bolt the door and throw away the key, yeah
Your dim reflection is all that you can see
So where is the justice when no one is at fault
And a human life is tragically wasted?
How fragile is the flame that burns within us all
To light each passing day, yeah2Embed
