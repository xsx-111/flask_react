No Control Lyrics
Culture was the seed of proliferation but it's gotten melded
Into an inharmonic whole, to an inharmonic whole
Consciousness has plagued us and we cannot shake it
Though we think we're in control, though we think we're in control

Questions that besiege us in life are testament
Of our helplessness

There's no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end
When we all disintegrate it will all happen again, yeah

Time is so rock solid in the minds of the hordes but they can't
Explain why it should slip away, explain why it should slip away
History and future are the comforts of our curiosity but here we are
Rooted in the present day, rooted in the present day

Questions that besiege us in life are testament
Of our helplessness

There's no vestige of beginning, no prospect of an end
When we all disintegrate it will all happen again, yeah
If you came to conquer, you'll be king for a day
But you too will deteriorate and quickly fade away
And believe these words you hear when you think your path is clear...
We have no control. We have no control
We have no control, we do not understand
You have no control, you are not in command
You have no control. We have no control
No control. No control. You have no control1Embed
