Automatic Man Lyrics
He's the latest superhero with powers so profound
He can leap a dotted line in just a single bound
I know you must have seen him in the books and magazines
He's the quintessential mindless modern epicene

His life is meaningful
Because he gets things done
Bang bang he's dead
Chalk up another triumph for our hero the Automatic Man

It's true you must have met him, he's your best friend and your foe
His opinions are determined by the status quo
A true creature of habit, he smokes three packs a day
When he has an original thought, he forgets it right away

He's the automatic man

He's a paradigm of carefree living
He's our mentor, disturb him if you can
He's the answer if your peace of mind is lacking
He's our savior, he is the common man
So if you are troubled by the daily bump and grind
Then take a careful look around and brother you will find
