Sometimes I Feel Like Lyrics
There's a specter in the corner of an illustrated page
And a lonesome muted stripling with a rapt remedial gaze
The poverty of his language and the wealth of his emotion
Bring him endless murky musings and unexpected frustration

Angst and madness weave the fabric of his life
Tomorrow might be better but right now it feels like

There's a panther wild and proud behind the bars of a redolent cage
And an underdeveloped intellect filled with impotent and static rage
And don't think you're exempt if you earn good weekly wages
Cause your neighbor's going crazy and insanity's contagious

I know there's so much you want to say
But your tongue gets in the way and sometimes it feels like

I know there's so much you want to say
And the tumbrel of your mind gets in the way
It's the same for everybody to degrees
We all get that foggy freeze and sometimes it feels likeEmbed
