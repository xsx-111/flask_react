Sanity Lyrics
There's a watch in my pocket and its hands are broken
The face is blank but the gears are turning
Confusion is a fundamental state of mind
It doesn't really matter what I'm figuring out
I'm guaranteed to wind up in a state of doubt

And sanity is a full-time job
In a world that is always changing
And sanity is a state of mind
That you believe in, sanity

There's a shadow on the wall where the paint is peeling
My body's moving forward but my mind is reeling
Depression is a fundamental state of being
It doesn't really matter how my day has turned out
I always end up living in this world of doubt

And sanity is a full-time job
In a world that is always changing
And sanity will make you strong
If you believe in sanity
And sanity is a full-time job
In a world that is always changing
And sanity is a state of mind
That you believe in, sanityEmbed
