It Must Look Pretty Appealing Lyrics
The wheat waving next to you is healthy and so fine
As is dinner with your loved ones every day
But your routine is changeless through the decades of your life
Green pastures, open spaces, holy ways

And it must look pretty appealing, the acres of lights
The crowded festive nights and the millions of others just like you
Yeah it must look pretty appealing, this other world of sin
We keep dreaming of what other people do

The person sitting next to you is dismal and deranged
On the bus ride home from work to end your day
And the food on your table is more plastic than protein
And your intellect depends on your TV

And it must look pretty appealing, the pastoral retreat
The folks on old main street and the few pleasant people just like you
Yeah it must look pretty appealing, the simple way of life
We keep dreaming of what other people do
But we never do what other people do
You're too scared of other people not like youEmbed
