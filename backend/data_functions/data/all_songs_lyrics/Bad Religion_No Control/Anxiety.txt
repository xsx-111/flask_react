Anxiety Lyrics
It's a love song to the self
A story recapped every day
It's a world of bogus feelings
And a world of slow decay
It's a world of laughter hidden by this world of fear and torment
A game of strange compulsion, our visceral convulsion

Anxiety for love, of life
Anxiety for pain
Anxiety, a feeling that you know you can't contain
Anxiety destroys us, but it drives the common man
Foundation of society
Anxiety
Suppress it if you can

The caste of coffee-achievers didn't perform like they planned
The morning rush hour traffic is our play of false elan
So run around your frantic track and lay you down to sleep
Tomorrow's the redemption
We strive for that exception

Anxiety for love, of life
Anxiety for pain
Anxiety, a feeling that you have nothing more to gain
Anxiety destroys us, but it drives the common man
Foundation of society
Anxiety
Suppress it if you can
What are we angry for?
We all need a common cure
That common goal for which you strive
To have more than the other guy

The quest for the truth
The quest for the gold
We end up all the same
The common lie
The righteous cry
We end up all the same
The angry crowd
Those lost and found
Everybody's all the same
The poet's pen
These words I lend
We all bend to anxiety

Anxiety for love, of life
Anxiety for pain
Anxiety, a feeling that you know you can't contain
Anxiety destroys us, but it drives the common man
Foundation of society
