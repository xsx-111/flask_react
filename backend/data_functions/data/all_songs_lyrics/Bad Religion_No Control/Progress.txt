Progress Lyrics
And progress is not intelligently planned;
It's the facade of our heritage, the odor of our land
They speak of Progress, in red, white and blue
It's the structure of the future as demise comes seething through
It's progress, 'til there's nothing left to gain
As the dearth of new ideas makes us wallow in our shame
So before you go contribute more
To the destruction of this world you adore
Remember life on Earth is but a flash of dawn
We're all part of it as the day rolls on

And progress is a message that we send
One step closer to the future, one inch closer to the end
I say that progress is a synonym of time
We are all aware of it but it's nothing we refine
And progress is a debt we all must pay
Its convenience we all cherish, its pollution we disdain
And the cutting edge is dulling
Too many people to plow through
Just keep your fucking distance
And it can't include you
It's progress, 'til there's nothing left to gain
It's progress, it's a message that we send
And progress is a debt we all must payEmbed
