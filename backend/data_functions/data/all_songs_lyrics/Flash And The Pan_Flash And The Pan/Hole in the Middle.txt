Hole in the Middle LyricsSummer city, morning sun
Early ending, just begun
Making daisies, laying round
Nothing doing, nothing found
Saw the fat man, saw the smoke
Cried a little, cracked a joke
What's the difference, just for fun
Look out mama, here I come
Hole in the middle, going down
Hole in the middle, way way down
Hole in the middle, slipping
Hard to figure, hard to take
Problem bigger, hard to fake
Ignore the answer, ignore the shame
Ignore the fat man, take the blame
What a shame What a game
What's her name
Summer city, hazy day
Problem bigger, plain as day
Hole in the middle, going down
Hole in the middle, way way down
Hole in the middle, sliding
Hole in the middle, two you know
Hole in the middle, two to go
Hole in the middle, spinning
Going down
Hole in the middle
Hole in the middle
Spinning round
Hole in the middle
Hole in the middle
The whole thing
Ole in the middle
Hole in the middle
Hole in the middle
Hole in the middle
Hole in the middleEmbed
