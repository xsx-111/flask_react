Lady Killer LyricsThere's a Jaguar in the driveway
A great big swimming pool
A big round bed and a five foot two
To keep him cool
And there's a hot rod on the table
A suitcase full of cash A big fat smile when he's facing the sun
The man got class
He's the law
Gets the draw
Broke a jaw
Won the war
And he knows the score
Lady-killer Watch it, watch it
Lady-killer
There's a mad dog down in Sheba
A growl in northern Spain
And there's a plan to take him out
He wins again And he's knight in PR. armour
Always gets the girl
A big fat smile when he's facing the sun
And saves the world
He's the law
Gets the draw
Broke a jaw
Won the war
And he knows the score
Lady-killer Watch it, watch it
Lady-killer
Awake
A dream
A room
A scheme
The real thing
"Walter Mitty come home"
Get it
Get it
You got it
Lady-killer
Watch it, watch it
Lady-killer
Lady killer
That's a fact, man in black, wears a stack
Lady killer
Oh look out Lady killer
Keeps it cool, goes to school, knows the rule, plays the fool
Lady killer
Knows that I'll make a call, very tall, on the ball
Lady killer
Lays it down all around, knows the sound, plays the clown
Lady killer
Man in heat, got a beat, keep the street nice and neat
He's a lady killer
Lady killerEmbed
