Waiting for a Train LyricsWonder why it's getting cold at night
I must be getting old
Looks like I'm gonna have to wait a while
What the hell, I'm bored
What's that there on the railway line
Looks like my old brown shoe
It ain't mine mister, how's that for laughs
Not even how do you do
Wonder what's cooking at the house tonight
Stew and beans
Tune that station, turn that dial
Have another dream
Ain't it stupid how some people stare
Not even how do you do
What's that mister - na na na
I'm just the same as you
Running down the main line
Waiting for a train
One
Two
Three
Four
