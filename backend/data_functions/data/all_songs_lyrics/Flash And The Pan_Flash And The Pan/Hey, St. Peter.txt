Hey, St. Peter LyricsThe morning was cold and lonely
City lights old and gray
The sun arose, and, trying to smile
Gave it all away
The honky-tonk called a stranger
The stranger couldn't pay the bill
Made a stand, raised his hand
Sang a song, no time to kill
I said, hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
I've got a tale to tell
I've just been down in New York town
It really feels like hell
It really feels like hell
Billy was out of fashion
Manhattan was years ago
Yesterday he wasted time
Money was kind of slow
Billy had friends of glory
Billy was a friend of fame
Took a chance and raised his hand
Sang a song, now he's back in the game
I said, hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
I've got a tale to tell
I've just been down in New York town
It really feels like hell (hell)
It really feels like hel)
I said, hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
It really feels like hell (hell)
It really feels like hell
Hey, St. Peter
Before you ring your bell
Just been down in New York town
Done my time in hell
Done my time in hell
I said, hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, St. Peter
It really feels like hell (hell)
It really feels like hell (hell)
It really feels like
