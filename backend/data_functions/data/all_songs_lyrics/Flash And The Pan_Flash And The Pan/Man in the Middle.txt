Man in the Middle LyricsSee the office, see the phone Call the number, no one home
Take a powder, have to think
Now the question, where to drink
He's a number nine man with a price on his head
A smile on his mirror and a sag in his bed
Man in the middle - left right
Man in the middle - that's right
Man in the middle - (ah!)
Take an evening, that's his style
Likes to boogie, style a while
Make it easy, piece of meat
Now the question, got no feet
He's a silicone man with a lump on his face
A stain on his shirt and a rat in the race
Man in the middle - left right
Man in the middle - that's right
Man in the middle - (ah!)
He never thought that he'd be number nine
But now he's in it, he's doing fine
Where he's going he doesn't know
But where it's showing he's never slow
Man in the middle - left right
Man in the middle - that's right
Man in the middle - (ah!)
See the jacket, up for sale
Takes the ante, save the whale
There's a call out, sprung again
Now the question, he don't know who to blame
Man in the middle - left right
Man in the middle - that's right
Man in the middle - (ah!)
Man in the middle - left right
Man in the middle - that's right
Man in the middle - all night
Man in the middle - all (way?)
Man in the middle - left right
Man in the middle - that's right
Man in the middle - all night
Man in the middle - (left right)Embed
