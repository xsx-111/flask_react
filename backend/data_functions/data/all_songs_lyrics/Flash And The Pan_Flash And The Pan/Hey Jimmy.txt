Hey Jimmy LyricsI know you're leaving
And I can't stop you know
Oh no not me
Oh no not me
I know your sorrow
But I can't help you know
And I can't tell you how
'Cos that would be
Too much for me
Pack your bags
Turn the key
Jimmy, you try to walk all over me
I know your reasons
You found a glory mill
Oh no not me
Oh no not me
I know you'll make it
You swallow every pill
And tough it out until
It's there to be
But not with me
Jimmy, you try to walk all over me
Hey Jimmy
Jimmy, you try to walk all over meEmbed
