Something About You LyricsSomething about you baby
Something about you baby blue
I don't know what it is whenever I'm around you
Some kind of magic that you do
Something about you baby
Something about you baby blue
I'm in another world whenever I'm around you
Something about you baby blue
Well I've tried to break the spell that you've been weaving
And I tried to understand the things you do
But I've found that I've just given up believing
There could be a way of leaving you
'Cos there's something about you baby blue
Something about you baby blue
Well I've tried to break the spell that you've been weaving
And I tried to understand the things you do
But I've found that I've just given up believing
There could be a way of leaving you
'Cos there's something about you baby blue
Something about you baby
Something about you baby blue
I don't know what it is whenever I'm around you
Something about you
Something about you
Something about you baby blueEmbed
