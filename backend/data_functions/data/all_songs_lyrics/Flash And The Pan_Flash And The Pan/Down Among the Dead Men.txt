Down Among the Dead Men LyricsIt was night
A starry moonless sight
Out in the mid Atlantic
There sailed a ship of light
She was big This ship of luxury
Everything was peaceful
No safer place to be
And she sailed
Through the night
On her way
Down among the dead men
Down among the dead men
The band played
She sailed the virgin
She sailed the sea
Down among the dead men
Captain Smith
The master in command
A man with wealth of wisdom
A fine upstanding man
But the fog He didn't hear the calls
The ice mountain was waiting
For fifteen hundred souls
And she sailed
Through the night
On her way Down among the dead men
Down among the dead men
The band played
She sailed the virgin
She sailed the sea
Down among the dead men
Down among the dead men
And into historyEmbed
