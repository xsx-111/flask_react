Conversation Piece Lyrics
Take me back to California
To those crystal neon signs
Where the traveling sensations
Are all blinded by the light
There are eyes in every corner
Bloated brains and rotten smiles
There are coats of many colors
Flying high up in the sky

Won't you come 'round my way for some conversation, please?
Won't you come 'round my way, it's a conversation piece

Look at all these shattered faces
They all look so out of place
They've got nothing left to live for
They'll be dead before they wake
I'd love to know just what you're thinking
Tell me what I ought to do
I will never leave you lonely
You're the one I'm running to
Get me out of California
Take me off into the blue
We could make it out together
To the place that's calling you

Won't you come 'round my way for some conversation, please?
Won't you come 'round my way, it's a conversation piece

Won't you come 'round my way for some conversation, please?
Won't you come 'round my way for some conversation, please?
Oh, won't you come 'round my way, it's a conversation pieceEmbed
