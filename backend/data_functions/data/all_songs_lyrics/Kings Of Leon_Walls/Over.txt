Over Lyrics
I see the grass beneath me
I smell the wind and sky
And think to myself
"Don't pass me by"
You dance in strange conditions with strangers of the night
I see you're crazy and so am I
You bled out red and blue
The boys of NYU, they saw you coming from miles away
Nothing is quite as homey
We dive each sunny day
I see you Kenny, you castaway

Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore

Bright lights, that make the city
Quaaludes on Christmas Eve
And all the good times, we've ever seen
The roles we play together
The slaps across my face
I face the music
You write the scene
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore

My angel hovers over
The light comes crashing in
I know itâ€™s how this here story ends
I'll hang around forever
Until you cut me down
All pressed and ready to face the crowd

Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore3Embed
