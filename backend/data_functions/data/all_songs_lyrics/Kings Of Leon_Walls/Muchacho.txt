Muchacho LyricsMy right hand partner
Used to work it for a living
He'd take the backseat
Of all that he was given
He'd let you rise
Then take the fall
He was my favorite friend of all
My old muchacho
Loved to dress for each occasion
Without that rocket ship
Taking me in the right direction
Those crooked eyes
That know it all
He was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all
He's wearing jean on jean
Cut him some slack, fox
Perched in the corner of the scene
Just here to take stock
He'll take the chain
He'll take the ball
He was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all1Embed
