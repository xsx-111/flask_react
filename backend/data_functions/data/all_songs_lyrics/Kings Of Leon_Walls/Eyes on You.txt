Eyes on You Lyrics
Out here looking for the good life
Tongue in my cheek and ya back in my knife
I keep pushing through
My eyes are right on you
Everyone says you should get away
Fast as you can, but I know you'll stay
You never fall behind
He's always on your mind
You're somewhere I wanna go
Nice and swift as we take it slow
Oh, we're on our way
Don't ever hesitate
I'll hide in the dark in the back of your brain
Laughing aloud as we go insane
No time to waste
I never come too late

If you don't like it, then try it
You don't like it, then try it
Oh, I believe it when I see it
I believe it when I see it
You're my misfit and I'm your freak
Dance all night 'til our knees go weak
We can shut this place down
No one else is around
I try hard to understand
The crush of the world in the palm of your hand
You know we sit just right
Let's run away from the light

If you don't like it, then try it
You don't like it, then try it
Well babe, I believe it when I see it
I believe it when I see it

Tongue in your cheek and back in my knife
Out here looking for the good life
Keep on pushing through
I got eyes on you
Baby, you know we're on our way
Misfit and freak every single day
Sitting ten feet tall
Let's go and take it all
If you don't like it, then try it
You don't like it, then try it
I know you can see it, I believe it
You can see it, I believe it

We're here for the moment, so let's own it
For the moment, so let's own it
It's here for the taking
Why you waiting?
It's good loving, it's worth making1Embed
