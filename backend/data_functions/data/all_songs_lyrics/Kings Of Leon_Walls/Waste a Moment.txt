Waste a Moment Lyrics
All the way from Waco to WeHo with a rabbit on her chain
Drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain
She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame
Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away

Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

Tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin always running from the law
Every other weekend, the week ends with his back in her claw
He's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night
Heâ€™s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights

Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, facing where the lines are broken
Oh, name your price to all this living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven


Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, face it where the lines are broken
Oh, name a price to all that's living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven6Embed
