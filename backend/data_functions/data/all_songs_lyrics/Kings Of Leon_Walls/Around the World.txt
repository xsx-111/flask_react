Around the World Lyrics
My corner, you'll find me every day
The boys come out
That's where we like to play
"Wanna tag along?" I said "No way."
One drop dead high
A price you're gonna pay

Been around the world, been around the world
I stormed the gates inlaid in pearl
(Been around the world, been around the world
Been around the world, been around the world)
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(Been around the world, been around the world)

Keep dancing, like it's ya last time
With softened eyes, swimming in delight
When the curtain falls, I'm on your scene
What sweet surprise sashay to me

Been around the world, been around the world
I stormed the gates inlaid in pearl
(Been around the world, been around the world
Been around the world, been around the world)
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(Been around the world, been around the world
Been around the world, been around the world)
Take it all the way, take it all the way
All the way
(Been around the world, been around the world
Been around the world, been around the world)
All around the world, all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(Been around the world, been around the world)4Embed
