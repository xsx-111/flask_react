Land of the Living LyricsWell, it's up in the mornin'
Everybody off and runnin'
Everybody got some place to be
Some people never go walkin'
Some people just stop talkin'
And I was slippin' away
You came and pulled me through
I wanna stay in the land of the living with you
I wanna stay in the land of the living
I wanna stay here with you
I wanna stay in the land of the living
I wanna stay here with you
We work and we worry
This old world's in such a hurry
So many things we just don't see
Some people always cryin'
Some people just stop tryin'
And I was slippin' away
You came and pulled me through
I wanna stay in the land of the living with you
We hot to do what we can
About all this pain and sorrow
But try to live just a little
We could all be gone tomorrow
When I look at you girl, me heart rejoices
You taught me somethin':
Considering the choices-
I wanna stay in the land of the living
I wanna stay here with you
I wanna stay in the land of the living
I wanna stay here with youEmbed
