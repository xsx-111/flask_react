Man with a Mission LyricsI see these women at the car wash, women at the mall
Little-bitty women, and women who are tall
One of them is perfect and I want her for myself
Never gonna settle for anybody else
All my good buddies try to fix me up-
Buddy, I've had enough
I'm gonna run a few red lights, grind a few gears
Start a few fist fights, drink a few beers
Even though I'm tryin' every trick in the book
You give me drop dead (drop dead), drop dead looks
You the finest woman that I've ever seen
Why you wanna be so mean?
Well everybody tries to tell me
There's nothin' I can do
But I'm a man with a mission
Baby you know it's you
Man with a mission
Man with a mission
Man with a mission
Baby, you know it's you
Well, I'm a man with a mission
Man with a mission
Man with a mission
Baby, you know it's you
It's you
Everybody runnin' round here
Sayin', "Where's the party? Where's the party?"
Sonny-boy, don't ask me, 'cause I don't know
I got somethin' else on my mind todayâ€”
Somewhere else to go
Well-a, well-a, well-a everybody tries to tell me
There's nothin' I can do
But I'm a man with a mission
Baby, you know it's you
It's you
Well, I'm a man with a mission........Embed
