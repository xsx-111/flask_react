Not Enough Love in the World LyricsSometimes I wonder where it is love goes
I don't know if even Heaven knows
But I know you had some dreams that didn't quite come true
And now I'm not the one, little girl, who's keeping you
I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl-
There's just not enough love in the world
I know people hurt you so bad
They don't know the damage they can do
And it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down just like
Children on a playground
Even after that ol' sun went down
I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl
There's just not enough love in the world
Oh darlin', this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's so hard to smile-
For the world, for the camera-
And still have something left
You don't have to prove nothin' to nobody
Just take good care of yourself
I'm not easy to live with-
I know that it's true
You're no picnic either, babe
And that's one of the things I loved about you
But a time will come around when we need to settle down
Got to get of this merry-go-round
I was either standing in your shadow or blocking you're light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl
There's just not enough love in the worldEmbed
