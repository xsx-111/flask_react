Building the Perfect Beast LyricsThe power of reason, the top of the heap
We're the ones who can kill the things we
Don't eat
Sharper than a serpent's tongue
Tighter than a bongo drum
Quicker than a one-night stand
Slicker than a mambo band
And now the day is come
Soon he will be released
Glory hallelujah!
We're building the Perfect Beast
(building, building, etc..)
It's Olympus this time- Olympus or bust
For we have met the enemy -and he is us
And now the day is come
Soon he will be released
Glory hallelujah!
We're building the Perfect Beast
(Building, Building)
Ever since we crawled out of the ocean
And stood upright on the land
There are some things that we just don't
Understand:
Relieve all pain and suffering
And lift us out of the dark
Turn us all into Methuselah-
But where are we gonna park?
(Building, Building)
The secrets of eternity-
We've found the lock and turned the key
We're shakin' up those building blocks
Going deeper into that box- (Pandora
Wouldn't like it)
And now the day is come
Soon he will be released
Glory hallelujah!
We're building the Perfect Beast
(building, building)
All the way to Malibu from the Land of the
Talking Drum-
Just look how far-look how far we've comeEmbed
