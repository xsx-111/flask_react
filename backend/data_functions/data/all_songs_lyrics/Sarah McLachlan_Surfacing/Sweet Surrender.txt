Sweet Surrender Lyrics
It doesn't mean much
It doesn't mean anything at all
The life I've left behind me
Is a cold room

I've crossed the last line
From where I can't return
Where every step I took in faith betrayed me
And led me from
My home

Sweet surrender
Is all that I have to give

Take me in
No questions asked
You strip away the ugliness
That surrounds me
(Who are you?)

Are you an angel?
Am I already that gone?
I only hope that I won't disappoint you
When I'm down here on
My knees
(Who are you?)
Sweet surrender
Is all that I have to give
(Who are you?)

Sweet surrender (surrender)
Is all that I have to give

And I don't understand
How the touch of your hand
I would be the one to fall
I miss the little things
I miss everything
About you

It doesn't mean much
It doesn't mean anything at all
The life I left behind me
Is a cold room
(Who are you?)

Sweet surrender (surrender)
Is all that I have to give
(Who are you?)
Sweet surrender (surrender)
Is all that I have to giveEmbed
