Witness LyricsMake me a witness
Take me out
Out of darkness
Out of doubt
I won't weigh you down
With good intention
Won't make fire out of clay
Or other inventions
Will we burn in heaven
Like we do down here
Will the change come
While we're waiting
Everyone is waiting
And when we're done
Soul searching
As we carried the weight
And died for the cause
Is misery
Made beautiful
Right before our eyes
Will mercy be revealed
Or blind us where we stand
Will we burn in heaven
Like we do down here
Will the change come while we're waiting
Everyone is waiting
