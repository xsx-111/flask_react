Gentle Moon LyricsSmile down on us sun, show your rays
When things come undone
All animals lead us to light
When we can't see
Stars, Saturn and moon glow for those
Who cannot get through
Rainfall and voice sound for those of whom
Still are not found
Oh, gentle moon, find them soon
Gentle moon, find them soon
Black sky and black sea, lighten up
When we can't breathe
All dreams escape fire over worlds
Fly but won't tire
Slow down on us wind, hold us still
When everything spins
All secrets and lies, let them out
Oh, dreams escape fire, they won't tire
Dreams escape fire, they won't tire
Oh, gentle moon, find them soon
Gentle moon, find them soon
Gentle moon, find them soon
Gentle moon, find them soon
All calendars pass, days die off
And hope cannot last
But if love was like stone, then yours was mine
Through to my bones
Oh, but how can we give back to those
With whom we can't live
When will the flame break
And spare the good people it takes
Oh, souls escape fire, they rise higher
Souls escape fire, they rise higher
Oh, gentle moon, find them soon
Gentle moon, find them soon
Gentle moon, find them soon
Gentle moon, find them soon1Embed
