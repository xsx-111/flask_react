Carry Me Ohio LyricsSorry that I could never love you back
I could never care enough in these last days
Her tears fell on her pages
Found me well on her words
I don't know what to do or say
Wadin' through warm canals and pools clear blue
The Tuscarawas flowed into the Great Lakes
Ridin' back where the highway met dead tracks
The ground is now cement and glass, so far away

Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel, Ohio
Green, green youth: What about the sweetness we knew?
What about what's good, what's true from those days?
Can't count to all the lovers I've burned through
So why do I still burn for you?
I can't say
Sorry that I could never love you back
I could never care enough in these last days

Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel, Ohio
Children blessed, gather round the home she rests
So pull and go over there Midwest, moon and sun
Flashes bringing on my open eyes to lightnin' storm
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm on my face
Gray, vague dreams, a million miles ago you seem
A star that I just don't see anymore
Words long gone, lost on journeys we walked on
Lost are voices heard along the way
Sorry for never goin' by your door
Never feelin' love like that anymore

Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel, Ohio6Embed
