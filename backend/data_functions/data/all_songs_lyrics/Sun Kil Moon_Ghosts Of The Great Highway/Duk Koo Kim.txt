Duk Koo Kim LyricsLookin' out on my roof last night
Woken up from a dream
I saw a typhoon comin' in close
Bringin' the clouds down to the sea
Makin' the world look gray and alone
Takin' all light from my view
Keepin' everyone in
And keepin' me here with you
Around you now
I can't sleep no more, baby
Around you still
Don't want to leave yet
Woken up from a dream last night
Somewhere lost in war
I couldn't feel my feet or hands
I didn't feel right anymore
I knew there I'd die alone
With no one to reach to
But an angel came down
And brought me back to you
I'd rather leave
This world forever, baby
Than let life go
The way it's goin'
Watchin' an old fight film last night
Ray Mancini and Duk Koo Kim
The boy from Seoul was hangin' on good
But the poundin' took to him
And there in the square he laid down
Without face, without crown
And the angel who looked upon him
She never came down
You never know
What day is gonna pick you, baby
Out of the air
Out of nowhere
Come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Oh, come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Oh, come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Oh, come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Oh, sing to me once more, my love
Words from your younger years
Oh, sing to me once more, my love
Words from your younger years
Oh, sing to me once more, my love
Words from your younger years
Oh, sing to me once more, my love
Words from your younger years
Birds gather â€˜round my window
Fly with everything I love about the day
Flowers, blue and gold and orange
Rise with everything I love about the day
Walk with me down these strange streets
How have we come to be here
So kind are all these people
How have we come to know them3Embed
