Last Tide LyricsEvery bird fall weak on lifeless ground
Every eye swelled from tear is ever clear
Every seed broken in spring lived till fall
All your babies be around to see them growin' up
Will you be here with me, my love
When the warm sun turns to ash
And the last tide disappear
All darkness near
I kept quiet so you'd think my heart was tough
I never showed you if I loved you enough
The dreams I had, yeah, I kept but I wouldn't dare
Share with you for fear of things still livin' in me
Will you be next to me my love
When the cold moon vanishes
And the last cries no yells
For it to hearEmbed
