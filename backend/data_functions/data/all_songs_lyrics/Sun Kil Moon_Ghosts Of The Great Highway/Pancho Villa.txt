Pancho Villa LyricsSalvador Sanchez
Arrived and vanished
Only twenty-three with so much speed
Ownin' the highway
Mexico City
Bred so many
But none quite like him, sweet warrior
Pure magic matador
Pancho Villa
Would never rest
'Til 1925, he closed his eyes
Two Manila stars would rise
Ghost of the Phillipines
Choirs and angels sing
Ukelele strings play for his legend
Ilolio king

How have they gone?
Fell by leather
All alone
And bound together
Benny "Kid" Paret
Came a good way
Climbed to gray skies to lift his hands
Stopped by the better man
Eyes of Las Villas
Cry for sons
Lost on distant shores, unforeseen horrors
Struck and delivered him

Where have they gone?
Fell by leather
All alone
And bound together
Where have they gone?
Fell by leather
All alone
And bound togetherEmbed
