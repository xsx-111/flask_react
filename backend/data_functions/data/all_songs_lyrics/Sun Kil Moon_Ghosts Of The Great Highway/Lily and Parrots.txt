Lily and Parrots LyricsHere she comes breakin' through my window
In the early mornin' hours
For the moment I am disrupted
But in time she'll make me smile
All the wondrous animals
Roamin' 'round the earth
Bring us songs of calm
They do no wrong, they do no wrong
You don't know just how much I miss you
Yeah, my stomach aches in your absence
I don't know what I'd do without you
'Cause I'd have no one to follow
You are my love
I hold you above
Everything and everyone
Yeah, everyone, everyone
Hear outside, all the kids are playin'
They're my wake-up call each day
Look at them, their little lives beginnin'
I have watched them over years
Bloomin' like sweet roses
Dryin' their wet noses
No thought of the cold
Yeah, I feel old, I feel old
Yesterday we found a hidden passage
And I opened my sleepy eyes
Through the trees parrots swept up past us
And the gardens there smelled good
All the pretty houses
Decoratively colored
Tonight I want no other
Than my own, than my own1Embed
