Salvador Sanchez LyricsSalvador Sanchez arrived and vanished
Only twenty-three with so much speed
Ownin' the highway
Mexico City bred so many
But none quite like him, sweet warrior
Pure magic matador
Pancho Villa would never rest
Till 1925 he closed his eyes
Two Manila stars would rise
Ghosts of the Philippines
Choirs and angels sing
Ukulele strings play for his legend
Iloilo king
How have they gone
Felled by leather
So alone but
Bound together
Benny “Kid” Paret came a good way
Climbed to the grey sky to raise his hands
Stopped by the better man
Eyes of Las Villas cry for sons
Lost on distant shores, unforeseen horrors
Struck and delivered him
How have they gone
Felled by leather
So alone but
Bound together
How have they gone
Felled by leather
So alone but
Bound togetherEmbed
