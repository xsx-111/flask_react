Glenn Tipton LyricsCassius Clay was hated more than Sonny Liston
Some like K.K. Downing more than Glenn Tipton
Some like Jim Nabors, some Bobby Vinton
I like 'em all
I put my feet up on the coffee table
I stay up late watchin' cable
I like old movies with Clark Gable
Just like my dad does
Just like my dad did when he was home
Stayin' up late, stayin' up alone
Just like my dad did when he was thinkin'
Oh, how fast the years fly
I know an old woman ran a donut shop
She worked late servin' cops
Then one mornin', babe, her heart stopped
Place ain't the same no more
Place ain't the same no more
Not without my friend, Eleanor
Place ain't the same no more
Man, how things change
I buried my first victim when I was nineteen
Went through her bedroom and the pockets of her jeans
And found her letters that said so many things
That really hurt me bad
I never breathed her name again
But I like to dream about what could have been
I never heard her calls again
But I like to dream1Embed
