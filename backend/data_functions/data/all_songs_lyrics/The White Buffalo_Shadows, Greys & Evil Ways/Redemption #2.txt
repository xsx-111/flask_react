Redemption #2 LyricsI killed many men with the greatest of ease
Forgive me, forgive me, I'm down on my knees
I don't believe that there's a Heaven to go
But I must get this evil out of my bones and my soul
Wash the blood from my hands, but my mind can't get clean
I must flush away what I've done, what I've seen
Well I'll hide when I will, my lament it just grow
My wife and my children, they don't have to know
The fire and the fever I forever fight
I must resist to dance in the devil's delight
Now all I need is a damn way to cope
There's no soap, no hope, no antidote
Let the truth wash over me
There's only one way to be free
All I really ever need
