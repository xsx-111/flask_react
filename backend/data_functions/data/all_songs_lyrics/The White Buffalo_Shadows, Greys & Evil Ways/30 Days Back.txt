30 Days Back LyricsThirty days back
Back from the war
Still adjusting my mind
Adjusting my score
Too long in the desert
Too long in the sun
Still looking for answers
But I ain't got none
Got a heart and a head
Too heavy to heal
Put a pistol in my mouth
Just to feel something real
They build me up strong
Made me numb and mean
Ship me on home
One killing machineEmbed
