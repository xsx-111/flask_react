The Getaway LyricsKeep your head down for now, cut the light
Just 'til we get out of town and I find
Find a place to hide
Follow me away from the light, through the pines
There's a clearing there up on the right, out of sight
Where we'll crash for the night
Behind us the damage is done, no one can erase
Love has no ending, just a resting place
But there's a place in the dark, in the black where the deals are made
I ain't your partner, I am your slave
Everything will be alright by my side
There ain't a word in my mind to describe
You and I
There's a trail of tears and love no one can erase
Love has no end, take it to the grave
There's a place in the dark in the black where the demons are made
But I ain't your partner, I am your slave
Keep your head down for now, cut the light
Just 'til we get out of town, and I find
Find a place to hide
'Til I find a place to hideEmbed
