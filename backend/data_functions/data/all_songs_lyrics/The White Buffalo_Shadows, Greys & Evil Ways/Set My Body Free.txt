Set My Body Free LyricsGonna set my body free
Run down to the river and drown
Gonna see what it's like to get clean
I'm gonna set my soul free
I'm gonna throw my faith in the fire
Gonna burn it till the sin ain't real
Come on child, don't you know right from wrong?
Come on child, don't you know how to get along?
I'm gonna set my heart free
I'm gonna bury it in fertile ground
I'm gonna see if it grows up mean
Gonna set my conscience free
Where there ain't no judge in sight
Well it's all just a mystery
Don't you know the answer's in the sky, oh, oh
If you believe you'll let your spirit fly, oh, oh
Can't you feel the heavens open wide, oh, oh
Fool, the answer ain't in the sky
It's in the heart of a child
The beauty's there inside
Gonna set my body free
Run down to the river and drown
Gonna see what it's like to get cleanEmbed
