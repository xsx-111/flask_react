The Whistler LyricsThis time is different
It's not like the times before
But I cross my heart, that I won't kill no more
Jesus watch over me
Keep my anger at home
You better bless these wicked hands, because they got a mind of they own
Don't go downtown
The devil whispers in my ear
It's time for your curtain call
So I dress myself on up, with alcohol
Step aside, step aside
Oh, let the whistler through
There really ain't no help at all for folks like me and you
Don't go downtown
Don't go downtown
Get your God damn hands out, don't you look at me
No one's dying here alone
Well I came to get it on
Lets get it on
This time is different
Not like the time before
I crossed my heart that I won't kill no more1Embed
