Pray to You Now LyricsHow can I leave the past alone?
Now that the end is coming on
I can't right all my wrongs
So I'll put 'em in songs, for now
Say goodbye, to the memories and the fear
Will you lead me upstairs to the light?
With my shadows and greys, and my evil ways
Well I pray to you now, I don't know how
It ain't in my heart, is it too late to start?
So long, to the body and the bones
They ain't much use to me now
If my faith isn't blind will I be left behind?
Well I pray to you now, I don't how
It ain't in my heart, is it too late to start?
What's behind the final curtain?
I can't be certain I'm right
All I know is I'm really hurtin'
I'm on my knees tonight
Well I pray to you now, I don't know how
It ain't in my heart, is it too late to start?
Well I pray to you now, well I don't know how
It ain't in my heart, is it too late to start?
Is it too late to start?Embed
