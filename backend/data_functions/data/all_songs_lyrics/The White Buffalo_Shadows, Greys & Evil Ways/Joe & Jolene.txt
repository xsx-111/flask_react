Joe & Jolene LyricsListen, here's another hard luck tune
Joe lost his job and now he just drinks in the afternoon
He just sits on the porch, staring out at the blue
Toasting the day 'till the day goes away then he's toasting the moon
Oh, so his wife up and left
Just a little too soon, for Joey
Jolene she ain't had no easy ride
Joe lost his shit and his heart seemed to split when she stood by his side
And Jolene, well you know she ain't no nun
She drinks in the car and she'll dance on the bar
And she's still hot as the sun
Oh, she hopes and she prays that he'll pull it through
Oh, how her feelings ebb and flow just like the rivers do, for Joey
Joey rolls up his sleeve, I still got your name tattooed
The ink's faded and grey, but it's still serenading you
And a love so true, ah for me and you
Joe and Jolene
Jolene your all I ever had
It's understood, you're the only thing good, in my world filled with bad
Jolene, without you I'm all alone
You're my love, you're my wife with you in my life well I'm always at home
Oh, I'll put the bottle down, I'll get straight for you
Oh, now that you've come home let's celebrate with one or two, to Joe and JoleneEmbed
