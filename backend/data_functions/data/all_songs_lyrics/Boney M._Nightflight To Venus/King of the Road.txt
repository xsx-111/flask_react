King of the Road LyricsTrailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let - 50 cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
Ain't got no cigarettes, ah but
Two hours of pushing broom
Buys an 8 by 12 four-bit room
He's a man of means by no means
King of the road
Third box car midnight train
Destination Bangor, Maine
Old worn-out suits and shoes
Don't pay no union dues
He smokes old stogies he has found
Short, but not too big around
He's a man of means by no means
King of the road
(He knows) Every engineer on every train
All of their children and all of their names
And every hang-out in every town
Every lock that ain't locked
When no one's around
I say, Trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let - 50 cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
Ain't got no cigarettes
I've got two hours of pushing broom
Buys an 8 by 12 four-bit room
He's a man of means by no means
King of the road
King of the road
King of the road
King of the roadEmbed
