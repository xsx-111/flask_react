Painter Man LyricsWent to college, studied arts
To be an artist, make a start
Studied hard, gettin' my degree
But no-one seemed to notice me
Painter man, painter man
Who wanna be a painter man?
Painter man, painter man
Who wanna be a painter man?
Tried cartoons and comic books
Dirty postcards could have done
Here was where the money laid
Classic art has had its day
Painter man, painter man
Who wanna be a painter man?
Painter man, painter man
Who wanna be a painter man?
Did adverts for T.V
Household shops and brands of tea
Labels all around the cans
Who wanna be a painter man?
Painter man, painter man
Who wanna be a painter man?
Painter man, painter man
Who wanna be a painter man?
Lalala, lalala
Lala, lalala, lalala
Painter man, painter man
Who wanna be a painter man?Embed
