Ground Zero Lyrics
Ahh, ayy
Ahh, ayy
Ahh, ayy
When it all falls down
And the law don't count
And it don't seem fair
And the people don't care
The speaker on?
Yeah, you like that?

Ahh, ayy
Ahh, ayy
When it all falls down
And the law don't count
And it don't seem fair
And the people don't care

Where in the world you gonna go?
Who in the world you gonna hold?
When all the world keeps holding on at ground zero
We'll leave it all with God
When it all falls down
And we almost drown
When the sin sinks in?
I guess it's every man for himself

Where in the world you gonna go?
Who in the world you gonna hold?
When all the world keeps holding on at ground zero
We'll leave it all with God

When the war it rages over the ages
You can't erase it once you spill the
Blood on the concrete river of deceit
Will you be around?

When it all falls down
And the law don't count
And it don't seem fair
And the people don't care

Where in the world you gonna go?
Who in the world you gonna hold?
When all the world keeps holding on at ground zero
We'll leave it all with God
Ahh, ayy
Ahh, ayy
Ahh, ayy
Ahh, ayy
Ayy (x11)1Embed
