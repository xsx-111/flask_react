Climbing Up The Walls Lyrics
I keep seeing your face when my eyes are closed
I'm remembering how it used to go
Overmedicated, nearly comatose
Or going out of your head, you're still on that road

So what's in your mind when you kill more than time?
You're sinking so low, thinking you will be high
Biting your lip while you're losing your mind alone
God knows

You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're just climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls

Now you're reaching that age where you should know
How to figure it out all on your own
On the far side of town is a room you love
I started tearing it down thinking you would follow

So what's in your mind when you kill more than time?
You're sinking so low, thinking you will be high
Biting your lip while you're losing your mind alone
God knows

The world won't rise and ease your crying
If you do nothing, if you do nothing
The world won't try to change your mind
If you don't change at all
The world won't rise and ease your crying
If you do nothing, if you do nothing
The world won't try to change your mind
If you don't change at all


Drunk, he's fast asleep
He's so tired, makes me weep
He stays up all night working on his songs
But then i guess we all do the same thing
He still asleep?Embed
