Take Me Alive Lyrics
I tried and tried to walk away
To be the bigger man and leave
You made it hard for me, for me
Its been a long lonely road
I didn't know which way to go
You made my blood run cold
And filled me up with sorrow

There's nowhere for me to go
I'm a long way away from home
I won't go without a fight
You'll never take me alive
You'll never take me alive, oh no you won't
Ever take me alive, oh no you won't
Take me alive, oh no you won't
Ever take me alive, oh no you won't

I tried and tried to shed your skin
But you've controlled me from within
Your love has been a sin
I won't forget tomorrow

There's nowhere for me to go
I'm a long way away from home
I won't go without a fight
You'll never take me alive
You'll never take me alive, oh no you won't
Ever take me alive, oh no you won't
Take me alive, oh no you won't
Ever take me alive, oh no you won't
You'll never take me alive, oh no you won't
You'll never take me alive, oh no you won't
You'll never take me alive, oh no you won't
You'll never take me alive, oh no you won't

(Build a fire inside the circle)
Ever take me alive, oh no you won't
(No retreat today)
Take me alive, oh no you won't
(Build a fire inside the circle)
Ever take me alive, oh no you won't
(No retreat today)
In the fire insideEmbed
