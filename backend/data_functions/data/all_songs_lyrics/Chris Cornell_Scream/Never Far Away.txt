Never Far Away Lyrics
You are the road that I will travel
You are the words I write
You are the ocean I will swallow
You are the wind I ride
You are the cause to keep my head up high
I'll never say goodbye
You gotta know I'll stay beside you
Right till the day I die

I don't want to change anymore
I've already paid
(Said, I've already paid)
I don't have to pray anymore
Because my soul has been saved
And now
Whenever I come, wherever I go
No, you're never far away, far away
Whenever I come, wherever I go
No, you're never far away, far away
Whenever I come, wherever I go
No, you're never far away, far away
Never far away

You're the blood that's in my veins
You're my second skin
I'm a feather on the wind
You will breathe me in
Every heart should have a beat
Every night a dream
Every king should have a queen
Every saint a sin
I don't want to change anymore
I've already paid
(Said, I've already paid)
I don't have to pray anymore
Because my soul has been saved
And now
Whenever I come, wherever I go
No, you're never far away, far away
Whenever I come, wherever I go
No, you're never far away, far away
Whenever I come, wherever I go
No, you're never far away, far away
Never far away

When I fall hard you make sure I don't break
Give me life inside of heaven's gates, I know
(Heaven, heaven)
You taught me how to live like love comes first
Gave me definition for the words I know
That there ain't no space between you and me

Whenever I come, wherever I go
No, you're never far away, far away
Whenever I come, wherever I go
No, you're never far away, far away
Whenever I come, wherever I go
No, you're never far away, far away
Never far away1Embed
