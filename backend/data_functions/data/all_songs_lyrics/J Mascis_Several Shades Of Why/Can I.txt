Can I LyricsAgain I'm lonely lonely lonely all the time
Can I feel the way but there's no peace to find
Can the way it looks be all it really means?
Can you take a step towards something we can build?
Can I go back?
Can I go instead in some place we can hide?
Can I go to sleep?
Is there a dream where I could find out what's inside?
Lots of time we spent in places we can't go
'Cause you walked with me still I don't really know
If it's time to waste then time something to do
But it's all been wasted not thinking of you
Or can I be the time?
Can I free the one who always know it's a sign?
Can I work it through?
Can I tip-toe the way I wanna do
I've been lost and lonely, still I made it through
If I lose again then there's nothing to do
If to pardon me you mean you wait and see
'Cause the waiting is what brings me to my knees
Can I be a part?
Tell me where to start and where to go away
If I had a home
Is it everything you need to make you stayEmbed
