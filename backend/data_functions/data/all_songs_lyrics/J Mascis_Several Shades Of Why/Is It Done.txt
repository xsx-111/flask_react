Is It Done LyricsI got more i got no need
I got nothing i could leave
I got things that you should see
I went riding all around
Hit the pass
I built this sound
Try'd to picture it going dow_wow_n
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Felt a pull i pulled away
We got nothing that ill say
Still i feel its not this way
Waiting nothings goin round
Can't seem to get it of the ground
Seeing if ill come around
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Or is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
I know my soul is battered
And i know my mind is gone
I been waiting for an answer
But the question takes to long
I need guidance on the river
I need everything ive done
So familiars coming at me
Don't want to blow it all at once
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Or is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh oohEmbed
