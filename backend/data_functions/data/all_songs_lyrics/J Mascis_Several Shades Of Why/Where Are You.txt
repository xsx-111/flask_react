Where Are You LyricsCan I go to the place where you are
Wishing that we might (?)
At least I know there's a place I can find you
I've gone over it so many times
Mass confusion in my heart and my mind
Can't really tell you 'cause I got no mouth to
'Cause I'm running to where you are
I can't tell no one
And I can't run that far
'Cause I'm running and it's a shame
If I could I would
But I can't take the blame
Can I run through the time like we said
Picking bits after years in my head
Got the logic in place but it's twisted
Have the time to make it all fit
But the question is how do you quit
Something I'm having a hard time resisting
'Cause I'm running
And it's a shame
'Cause I felt it long before I knew your name
And I'm feeling insecure
Gotta find a way to get there by myself
Drop in some hints
Then I look to my friends
Who's gonna take you
And you just pretend
Everything stirred in my brain in and out
I got more than enough, how 'bout you?
What are you seriously looking to do?
Is there a way for this to turn out alright?
'Cause I'm running
I think I'm lost
Weighing out the feelings
Looking at the cost
And I'm feeling
You are too
So how will we know we're suppose to doEmbed
