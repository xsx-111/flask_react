Very Nervous and Love LyricsTell me why you broke
Tell me 'cause I'm nervous and love
I've been thinking less
I've been thinking out loud, to prayers
Tell me where we are
Tell me 'cause we never get far
And I've tried my only hand
And I've tried to keep it simple
You just couldn't understand
I've been holding back
I've been holding pieces entrapped
I don't know what's wrong
I don't know my reasons
So long
Hope has left me here
Hope has left me wonderin'
And I feel
And I'm s'pposed to be so free
And the darkness pulls me over
Why did it have to be me?
I can't speak my mind
I can't even speak
I'm fine
Tell me why'd you go
Tell me 'cause I'm nervous
Take it slow
I don't see you wait
I don't see you coming
It's a dream
And it's falling off of it
Thought I'd never have to face it
Something hard is here insteadEmbed
