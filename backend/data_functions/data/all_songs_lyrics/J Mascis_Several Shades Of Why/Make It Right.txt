Make It Right LyricsI don't know when (?)
I don't know how we know
All I know is I feel it
I can't make it alone
I can't face on my own
I need more than to be here
Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
Smile won't let me astray
Silence held me the way
Now I'm lost and I'm reelin'
I know more than I should
Never did need no clue
All I know is I feel it
Make things right
Make things right tonight
Make it rightEmbed
