Not Enough LyricsShe was gone again
And I'm not sure what I knew
But I looked again
And the truth gave me a clue
Said my love
Why was it not enough to keep
And it's tough
And I can't accept defeat
And I know in my mind, I know I should be grateful
But it's hard for me, I'm done so easily
Can we be loved, can we be free
Can we be all these things you said to me
Can we be loved, can we explain
Can we be all these things and hold the pain
Can we be loved, can we be free
Can we go on, can we not see
Cause I know myself and I can't take it easy
And it can't be good if I'm the one who's mean
And we were off again
And I just could not believe
It took so long again
I should've known, I should've seen
Said my love
That was the only way to be
Not enough
Then the future came to me
And I know in my mind, I'm outta time, it's over
And I'll leave him here, is there no way to show her?
Can we be loved, can we be free
Can we be all these things you said to me
Can we be loved, can we explain
Can we be all these things and hold the pain
Can we be loved, can we be free
Can we go on, can we not see
Said my love
That was the only way to be
Not enough
And I can't believe it's me
And I know my love, and I know my love is over
And I wish I did, I wish I didn't knowEmbed
