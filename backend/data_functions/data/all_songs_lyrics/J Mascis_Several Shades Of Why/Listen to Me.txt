Listen to Me LyricsListen to me
I can't wait to see You
I can't wait to be You
I can't wait
The blame's on me
I can't wait to meet You
I can't wait to see You
I can't wait
Waiting's what we do
Not enough to give enough to You
Wish there was a place we remained since
A place where we could rest and we would know
The blame's on me
I can't wait to be You
I can't wait to feel You
I can't wait
Listen to me
I can't wait to see You
I can't wait to be You
I can't wait
It shouldn't take so long
Something that's so real to come along
I feel the (?)
I can't pay the price
That don't make it right
I'm here alone
What's left of me
I can't wait
I'm done here
And won't stay
Longer
And I can't wait
Listen to me
Is it right to be here
I can't fight
Can't win on my ground
Pain is what we do
Got enough to make some more for You
I can take so much before I bleed
Knowing what's the stake is all I do
Listen
