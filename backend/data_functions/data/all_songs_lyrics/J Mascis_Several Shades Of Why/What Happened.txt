What Happened LyricsShe was always far away
Got this dream it hurts today
Tried to keep 'em all in place
Get so close from breaking down
(?) this whole town
I waited won't you come around
What happened to my ma'
What happened to my ma'
On the way
What happened to my ma'
What happened to my ma'
All the way
Have you taken a new form
Are you the brother I don't know
Deep bright eyes look to this show
I just feel the strongest pole
Does it mace into the truth
Left not knowing what to do
What happened to my ma'
What happened to my ma'
On the way
What happened to my ma'
What happened to my ma'
On the way
Got so high
(?)
All my trial
Is it time
I get anxious
I go nuts
Plenty of times when it's too much
(?)
We don't wanna set it straight
No conclusions it's too late
It's not the same
What says fake
What happened to my ma'
What happened to my ma'
On the way
What happened to my ma'
What happened to my ma'
On the way
Take my hand
Hold it still
It's my
It's my
It's myEmbed
