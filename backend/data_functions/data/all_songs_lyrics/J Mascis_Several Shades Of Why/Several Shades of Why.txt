Several Shades of Why LyricsThere's no peace, little comfort, no one's shoulder
Minor inklings of a time that made you colder
I'm not saying much I tried hard that's all I do
Tried and waited then got tired, that's about it
With my time
With my time
Got to wait this time
Why should I have time to answer?
Several shades of why
I can't go back, it's faster
Don't expect it 'cause the ending's a disaster
Nothing nothing nothing man, a little laughter
With my time
With my time
Gone at it the wrong way
Thought I'd find out but I missed it
If I make it through I'll run and stop the twistin'
Way I steered us off'll lose it just to give in
Hell may not dwell on the dead
How about the living?
With my time
With my time1Embed
