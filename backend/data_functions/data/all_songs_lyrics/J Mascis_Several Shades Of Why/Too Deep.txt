Too Deep LyricsI saw You
I saw You
I saw everything emotion
I saw why it's left unspoken
I crawled out
I crawled out
I'll do better than the last time
Got so much more than my mind
I saw You
I saw You
I saw You
I know why I went to see it
Still not sure what I believe in
I walked in
I walked in
Is this the time I'll understand
Will it pass right through my hand
Till I see You
Said I'm the one who knows
Said I'm the one who knows
Please don't speak of it no more
Been left out starting to show
I just stared but not a peep
You walked by it gets too deep
Turn me stick in to my soul
Hasn't changed much getting old
I saw You
I saw You
I saw YouEmbed
