Show Some Emotion LyricsShow some emotion
Put expression in your eyes
Light up if you're feeling happy
But if it's bad then let those tears roll down
Some people hurting
Someone choking up inside
Some poor souls dying
Too proud to say they got no place to lie
And there's people if they hear a joke
Can't keep the laugh out of their eye
I said
Show some emotion
Put expression in your eyes
Light up if you're feeling happy
But if it's bad then let those tears roll down
Some people in love
But all they got's a photograph
How can they get it
Too scared to open their mouths and laugh
I said
Show some emotion
Put expression in your eyes
Light up if you're feeling happy
But if it's bad then let those tears roll down
Come on try
Learn to bleed when you get a bad fall
Light up light up light up if it's nice
And if it's bad then let those tears roll down
I said
Show some emotion
Put expression in your eyes
Light up if you're feeling happy
But if it's bad then let those tears roll down
Come on try
Come on try
Come on try
Learn to bleed when you get a bad fall
Light up light up light up if it's nice
But if it's bad then let those tears roll down
If it's bad then let those tears roll downEmbed
