Get in the Sun LyricsOh babe
I'm gonna site myself right down and relax
Oh babe
I'm gonna take it real easy and that's a fact
I got my glass of water cooling
Got the shades over my eyes
Don't try to wake me
Before day turns to night
Babe
Open all the doors and take down the blinds
Babe
Trap that sun keep it nice and bright
I got this feeing deep inside me
Summer will be good
Don't tell me different
Think that it should
Get up get out get in the sun
You know that it's nice
Oh
Sun is out
Make me feel so good
Make me feel so good
Long as the sun is out
I'm all rightEmbed
