Opportunity LyricsOpportunity
Came to my door
When I was down
On my luck
In the shape
Of an old friend
With a plan
Guaranteed
Showed me the papers
As he walked me to the car
His shoes
Finest leather
He said
You could wear this style
Follow my advice
He owned a gun
The calibre escaped me
But I noticed
Straight away
It made me itch
Carried an address
With numbers on the back
And an L-shaped
Bar of iron
What's that for
I asked my man
With eyes
Wide opened
And the knowledge in my head
And he said
Opportunity
World wide adventure
Money in the bank
We did the job
The work was so well done
No one saw us coming
Much less leave
But what I dropped
Carried my credentials
And a black and white
Shot of you and me
What's that for
I asked the cop
With eyes of innocence
The knowledge in my head
And he said
Opportunity
World wide adventure
Let me have your handEmbed
