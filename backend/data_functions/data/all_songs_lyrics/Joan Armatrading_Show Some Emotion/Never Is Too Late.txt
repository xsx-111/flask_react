Never Is Too Late LyricsAlone
You turn your head around
On your own
The order to the man
One strong drink
Searching for that question
To give yourself some reason
To talk to a stranger
Don't be afraid
We all need someone
Who is on our side
Some things must not wait
And a pledge short lived or long
Is all that's needed
Who'll help
Don't isolate
If you see someone not dancing
It's your fault
Never is too late
And a dance short lived or long
Is all that's needed
Who will help this lonely one
Move
Direction seems unknown
Walk
Another hour passed
And still alone
Searching for that question
Looking for somebody
Trying to find that person
To love
Just be aware
Asking for help from someone
Is not too easyEmbed
