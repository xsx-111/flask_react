Willow LyricsI may not be your best
You know good ones don't come by the score
You've got something missing
I'll help you look you can be sure
And if you want to be alone
Or someone to share a laugh
Whatever you want me to
All you gotta do is ask
Thunder
Don't go under the sheets
Lightning under a tree
In the rain and snow
I'll be your fire side
Come running to me
When things get out of hand
Running to me
When it's more than you can stand
I said I'm strong
Straight
Willing
To be a
Shelter
In a storm
Your willow
Oh willow
When the sun is out
A fight with your best girl
Prettiest thing you ever saw
You know I'll listen
Try to get a message to her
And if it's money you want
Or trouble halved
Whatever you want me to
All you gotta do is ask
I said I'm strong
Straight
Willing
To be a
Shelter
In a storm
Your willow
Oh willow
When the sun is out
Shelter in a storm
Your willow
Oh willow
When the sun is outEmbed
