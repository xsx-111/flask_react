Peace in Mind LyricsSlow to be angered
Quick to forgive
No jealous state am I in
Some people get satisfaction
From being and bringing down
But you know pleasant things
Are still gonna happen
If you're fun
Or wear a frown
So go on with your plan
I thought you were
Better than that
I know that good things
Are still gonna happen
If you lie
Or make it sound
Cold
It's a state of mind
And know whatever happens
I need peace in mind
You're looking for something
And I suspect revenge
All right
Get your satisfaction
Hurting me inside
But you know somehow
I saw it happening
And it's sad
It came about
So go on with your plan
I thought you were
Better than that
I know that good things
Are still gonna happen
If you lie
Or make it sound
