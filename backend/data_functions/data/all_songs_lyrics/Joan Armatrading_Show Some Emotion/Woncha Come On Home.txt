Woncha Come On Home LyricsEvery light is on
But all the rooms
Are empty
Except one
Oh babe don't stay too late
You know I hate to be alone
And I'm alone
Baby woncha come on home
There's a madman
Standing on the corner
And he keeps on looking
At my window
Oh baby woncha come on home
Home
Every key is turned
And every window's bolted
From inside
Oh babe you know I get so scared
You know I couldn't live alone
It's just been confirmed
Baby woncha come on home
Standing on the corner
Is a madman
Looking at my window
Oh baby woncha come on home
Home
Baby woncha come on home
There's a man
Standing on the corner
Now a shadow
Moves across the window
Oh baby woncha come on home
