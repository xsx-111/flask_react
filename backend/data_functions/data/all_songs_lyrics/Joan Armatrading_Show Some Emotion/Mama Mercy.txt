Mama Mercy LyricsI was catching up with my baby
When I saw you coming down the road
I thought
Mama Mercy
Don't let him get me
I got a happy life at home
But as sure as sure is
You passed me
Of course I had to look
And as I turned my head
I knew right then
I was gonna have to do it again
And I was singing
Mercy
Mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray
It's gonna hurt
I was drinking beer with a close friend
When I saw you walking in the room
I thought
Mercy me
I can't keep a running
You're gonna get me, oooh
As wrong as this is
You touched me
Of course you had me hooked
And as I kissed your lips
I knew right then
I was gonna have to do it again
And I was singing
Mercy
Mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray
It's gonna hurt
I was sitting down with my sweetheart
Making out I was sincere
I thought
Mercy me
I can't keep a lying
I got to get the air clear
As long as you stay with me
Forget the whole affair
I promise you
I'll be true
I'm never gonna do it again
And I was singing
Mercy
Mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray
It's gonna hurtEmbed
