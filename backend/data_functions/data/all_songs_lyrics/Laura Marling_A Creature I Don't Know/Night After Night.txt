Night After Night LyricsDarling, I loved you
I long to become you
And know what it is that you gave
We dance the sorrow
Forgive me tomorrow
I pray
Night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken
My mind drift away?
Dear lover forsaken
Our love is taken away
You were my speaker
My innocence keeper
I don't
Night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken
My mind drift away?
Dear lover forgiven
My love is driven by rage
Oh I should just leave you
Instead of deceive you
But I don't
Night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken
My mind drift away?
I count no one, hold nobody's ear
I showed you my hand once and you hit me in fear
I don't stand for the devil
I don't whisper in ears
I stand on the mountains and call people to hear
It's a sudden burst of light
It's a fate foretold
It is knowing, it is knowing
He longs for the answers, as all of us must
He longs for the woman who will conquer his lust
He screams in the night, I scream in the day
We weep in the evening and lie naked and pray
Night after night, day after day
Night after night, day after day
Night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken
And my mind drift away?
It's a tempting communion
It's a fate foretold
It is knowing, it is knowing
What it is that you're toldEmbed
