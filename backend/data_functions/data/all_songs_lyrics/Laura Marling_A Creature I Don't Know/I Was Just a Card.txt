I Was Just a Card LyricsI was just a card, caught up in the stars
Looking down to Mars
You know, you know
I know, I know something
About you that you don't want me to know
Never found a solid hand till I found that man
Till I found that man of mine
You were looking at me, thinking
"Who am I?"
Never knew the sky was wide
Till I took that flight
Till I took that flight to him
Tonight
I was just a card, caught up in the stars
Looking down from Mars
You know, you know
He knows, he knows something
About me that I don't want him to know
Could've sworn I had that man when he took my hand
When he took my hand down near you
You were looking at me, thinking
"Who is she?"
Didn't even see the night till I said goodbye
Till I said goodbye to him
TonightEmbed
