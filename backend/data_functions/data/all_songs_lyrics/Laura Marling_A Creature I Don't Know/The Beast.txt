The Beast LyricsWhere did our love go
You will never know
How did you get home
You will never know
Did you catch yourself in the mirror?
It's a sight I understand
You consider it all for a second
And put it down to sleight of hand
You know I've been running 'round for hours
Calling my Egyptian blood to bear me flowers
Calling Sophia, goddess of power
Instead I got the beast
And tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
And here comes the beast
You're okay now, I suppose
You're not pulled by the rope
I'm pulled by the pull on my throat
I'm pulled by the rope
I swing from the trees into the slope
Hold my head high, just by the tip of my toes
And he lies, he lies so sweet that I choke
Tonight I choose the beast
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
And here come the beast
Put your eyes away
If you can't bear to see your old lady lay
Down next to the beast
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
And here come the beast
Look at yourself in the mirror
It's a sight I understand
You consider it all for a second
And put it down to sleight of hand
I give you the best advice that I can
I suggest that you be grateful
There's no blood on my hands
And assume yourself weaker than the fall of man
And look out for the beast
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
And here come the beast
Put your eyes away
If you can't bear to see your old lady lay
Down next to the beast
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
And here come the beastEmbed
