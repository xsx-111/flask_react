Salinas LyricsI am from Salinas
Where the women go forever
And they never ever stop to ask why
My mother was a saviour
Of six foot of bad behaviour
Long blonde curly hair down to her thigh
O my mother
O my friends
Ask the angels
Will I ever see heaven again?
Late into the evening
They would take each other screaming
Lookin darkly to the back of her eyes
A careless beast was bleating
That the air behind was breathing
That they mustn't ever look up to the sky
There no answers
There are found
Ask the angels
Am I heaven bound?
Mmmm put it down to me
I, who speak awkwardly
Any word if it is heard is not intended to be
Not for him and not for her
And not for them and not for me
O and that gun would turn
Before the sun starts to burn
Understand
Mmmm when the clouds roll in
And we start to pay for our sins
With a gun in my hand
And my son at my shoulder
Believe I will run
Before that boy gets older
O and that gun will turn
Before the sun starts to burn
Understand
O and that gun will turn
Before the sun starts to burn
Understand
I am from Salinas
Where the women go forever
And they never ever stop to ask why
My mother she's a saviour
Of six foot of bad behaviour
With long dark curly hair down to her thigh
O my mother
O My friends
Ask the angels
Will I ever see heaven again?
Will I ever see heaven again?
Will I ever see heaven again?
Punish them all for they speak too much
Hate the world for what it did to us
Will I ever see heaven again?Embed
