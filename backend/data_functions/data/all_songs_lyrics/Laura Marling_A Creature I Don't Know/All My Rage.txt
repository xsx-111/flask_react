All My Rage LyricsStole my children, left my son
Of all of them, he's the only one
Who did not mean that much to me
I tip my cap to the raging sea
Oh cover me up, I'm pale as night
With a mind so dark and skin so white
Is this the devil having fun?
Tip my cap to the raging sun
Now all my rage been gone
Now all my rage been gone
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun
Stole my children, left my son
Of all of them, he's the only one
Who did not mean that much to me
I tip my cap to the raging sea
My daughter, she's the pretty one
I married her off to the reverend's son
Now she lives in a sin-free world
Now tip your cap to the brave old girl
Now all my rage been gone
Now all my rage been gone
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun
Now all my rage been gone
Now all my rage been gone
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sunEmbed
