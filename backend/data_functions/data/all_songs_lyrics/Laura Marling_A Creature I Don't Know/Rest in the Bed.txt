Rest in the Bed LyricsThere lies a man of my heart
A fine and complete work of art
Here I his woman
His home and his heart
And proud to be playing that part
And proud to be playing that part
Rest in the bed of my bones
All that I want is a home
And all you can do
Is promise me bold
That you won't let me grow dark
Or cold
As long as we both shall live
The bite will come
But you'll feel your call as a sound as I
Believe in you
The first deal's the hardest I'm sure
Where our shadows come to the shore
Know that it's you and I till the end
And all I want from life is to
Hold your hand
All that I have are these bones
And all that I want is a home
And all you can do
Is promise me bold
That you won't let me grow dark
Or cold
As long as we both shall live
The sirens come
They always will
But the dart between my heart and his
Is as good as a diamond chain
Rest in the bed of my bones
All that I want is a home
And all you can do
Is promise me bold
That you won't let me grow dark
Or cold
As long as we both shall liveEmbed
