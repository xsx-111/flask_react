My Friends LyricsMy friends, my dear friends
And lovers, oh my lovers
I leave you for them
They got a hand on my back
Mama has money now and Mama has friends
She's making rags for some uptown hags
With their money in bags
And why are you so sad?
Why are you always so sad?
Why do I not understand?
Why don't I see what it is you see?
Why can't I live and just be?
I'm full of guilt
I am full of guilt
You're very tall, you're very handsome
You have it all, your skin smells like man
And I, you never know how I ached
You will never know how I ache
Ever considered the sea?
I heard you had to be strong
Why not float around with me?
It won't take you so long
You can go where I'm at
You can hang around with me
And a few good men will go where they ought
Where they ought not be
And a few good mothers go for what they
What they ought not teach
And I long for a touch or reminder of us, but
But it must not be
And a few strong branches over water
Reach for what they ought not reach
I hope your mother knows where it is you have been
I hope your mother knows what it is you have seen
She'd be so proud1Embed
