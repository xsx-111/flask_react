Sophia LyricsOh I have been wandering where I have been pondering
Where I've been lately is no concern of yours
Who's been touching my skin?
Who have I been letting?
Shy and tired-eyed am I today
I'm wounded by dust
Oh I have been wandering where I have been pondering
Where I've been lately is no concern of yours
Who's been touching my skin?
Who have I been letting?
Shy and tired-eyed am I today
Sometimes I sit, sometimes I stare
Sometimes they look and sometimes I don't care
Wearily I weep, sometimes I must
I'm wounded by dust
When the bell toll, when the bell gon' chime
You better call for your woman up high
And when the bell tolls for your last day
You'll be getting down on your knees to pray
I'm a good woman and I never did say
Whatever it was that you did that day
I'm not a woman that is going to place claim
But you said that it was coming on judgment day
Now Sophia
I'm wounded by dust
When the bell toll, when the bell gon' chime
You better call for your woman up high
And when the bell tolls for your last day
You'll be getting down on your knees to pray
I'm a good woman and I never did say
Whatever it was that you did that day
I'm not a woman that is going to place claim
But you said that it was coming on judgment day
Now Sophia
I'm wounded by dust
Now SophiaEmbed
