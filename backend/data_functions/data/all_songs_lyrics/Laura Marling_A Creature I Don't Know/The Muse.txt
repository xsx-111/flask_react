The Muse LyricsGod's work is planned
I stand here with a man
That talked to me so candidly
More than I choose
My lips at once are rouged
I feel again the blues
Of longing, ever longing, to be
Confused
He wrote me a letter
Saying he would love me better
Than my poor son's begetter
The ruse
Spoke of love like hunger
He at once was younger
Younger, ever younger, in my hunger
For a muse
Finest man that I've seen
Ever since my eyes have been
But his honesty did gleam me blind
Keep those thoughts from sight
Follow me into the night
And you can call on me when you need
The light
You know what I need
Why won't you give it me?
Must I fall down at your feet and plead?
Don't you be scared of me
I'm nothing but the beast
And I'll call on you when I need
To feastEmbed
