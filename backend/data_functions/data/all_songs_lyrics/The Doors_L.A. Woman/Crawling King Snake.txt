Crawling King Snake Lyrics
Well, I'm the Crawling King Snake
And I rule my den
I'm the Crawling King Snake
And I rule my den
Yeah, don't mess around with my mate
Going to use her for myself

Caught me crawling, baby, window
Grass is very high
Keep on crawling until the day I die
Crawling King Snake
And I rule my den
You better give me what I want
Gonna crawl no more


Caught me crawling, baby
Crawling around your door
Seeing everything I want
I'm going to crawl on your floor
Let's crawl
And I rule my den
Come on, give me what I want
Ain't gonna crawl no more
Ah, crawl a while
Come on crawl
Come on crawl
Get on out there on your hands and knees, baby
Crawl all over me
Just like the spider on the wall
Ooo, we gon' crawl, one more

Well, I'm the Crawling King Snake
And I rule my den
Call me the Crawling King Snake
And I rule my den
Yeah, don't mess around with my mate
Gonna use her for myself4Embed
