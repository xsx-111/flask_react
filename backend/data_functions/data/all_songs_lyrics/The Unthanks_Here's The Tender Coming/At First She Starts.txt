At First She Starts LyricsAt first she starts and then she's startled
I see that light in her eyes
When you realised you were a bird
At dawn when you woke with air in your throat
So far do-r√©-mi
Sing for me loudly
Serenade me
Mess with the melody
Light and shade
All my eyes can see
Oh but you are the phrase at the end of the bar
A long and high refrain
Hanging around for the choir to strike its sound
So's you can holler your joy and your painEmbed
