Betsy Bell LyricsOh my name is Betsy Bell in the Gallowgate I dwell
No doubt you'll wonder what I'm doing here
But if you wait a while, sure my tale I'll tell to thee
It's a tale no doubt you'll think it's very queer
For I'm looking for a lad he may be good or bad
I'm going to take the first one that I see
He may be young or old or grey headed, frank or bald
It's anything that wears the breeks for me
Oh but of lads I've had my share, sure, I've had a score or mair
But how they threw me off I didn't know
For I'm neither prude nor shy that the lads should pass me by
Oh I wonder what's to do with all the men
Now as I went out last nicht, sure I met with Sandy Wricht
An he hauled me in as I was passing by
He asked me if I'd wed and this is what I said
"Man, if you are quite agreeable so am I"
Oh I was so proud of the chance, sure, with joy it made me dance
The marriage it was to be right there and then
But when I got my marriage frock, oh! he said it was all a joke
Oh I wonder what's to do with all the men
Oh but of lads I've had my share, sure, I've had a score or mair
But how they threw me off I didn't know
For I'm neither prude nor shy that the lads should pass me by
Oh I wonder what's to do with all the men
But if there's any laddie here who would like a little dear
A widower or a bachelor though he be
If for marriage he is bent, then I'd give him my consent
It's not every day you'll get a chance like me
For I can weave an I can work, I can sew and mend a sark
I'm as thrifty as any lass I know
For on the nail I'll hang but if I get a leave to sing
Oh I wonder what's to do with all the men
Oh but of lads I've had my share, sure, I've had a score or mair
But how they threw me off I didn't know
For I'm neither prude nor shy that the lads should pass me by
Oh I wonder what's to do with all the menEmbed
