Living By The Water LyricsI was living by the water
Late July moon's early quarter
Summer mornings, early dawnings
Pay no heed to me, gave no warning
Of their endless way
Seatide flowing in the river
Is all the music I would ever
Have, a long, long day since I went away
On the mountain there my song I'll sing
When the wind plays in the raven's wing
And I saw maudlin horses
Dancing over the plains of the deadland marshes
Down to the sea voices from the empty moor
They call me past the stranger's door
Because I keep no company I make no enemies
On the lonely sands of the western strands
It was there I made my wayEmbed
