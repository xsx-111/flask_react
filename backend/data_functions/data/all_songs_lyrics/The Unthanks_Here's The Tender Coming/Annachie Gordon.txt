Annachie Gordon LyricsBuchan, it's bonny, and there lives my love
My heart it lies on him, and it will not remove
It will not remove for all that I've done
Never will I forget my love Annachie
For Annachie Gordon, he's bonny and he's braw
He'd entice any woman that ever him saw
He'd entice any woman and so he has done me
Never will I forget my love Annachie
Down came her father, standing on the floor
Saying Jeanie you're trying the tricks of a whore
You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee
You must marry Lord Salton and forget young Annachie
For Annachie Gordon he's only but a man
And although he may be pretty but where are all his lands
Saltons lands are broad and his towers they stand high
You must marry Lord Salton and forget young Annachie
With Annachie Gordon I'd beg for my bread
Before I'd marry Salton with gold to my head
With gold to my head and with gowns fringed to the knee
Oh I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie
And you that are my parents to the church you may me bring
Oh but unto Lord Salton I will never bear a son
Oh a son or a daughter I'll never bow my knee
I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie
When Jeanie was married from the church she was brought home
She and her maidens so merry should have been
When she and her maidens so merry should have been
She's gone to her chamber and she's crying all alone
Come to bed now Jeanie, my honey and my sweet
For to style you my mistress it would not be meet
Oh it's mistress or Jeanie it's all the same to me
For it's in your bed Salton I never shall be
Up and spoke her father and he's spoken with renown
All of you that are her maidens won't you loosen off her gown
But she fell down in a swoon, so low down by their knees
Saying look on for I'm dying for my love Annachie
The day that Jeanie married was the day that Jeanie died
That's the day young Annachie comes rolling from the tide
And down came her maidens and they're wringing of their hands
Saying woe to you Annachie for staying from the sands
So long from the sands and so long upon the flood
They've married your Jeanie and now she is dead
All you that are her maidens won't you take me by the hand
Won't you lead me to the chamber where my true love lies
And he's kissed her cold lips until his heart turned to stone
And he's died in the chamber where his true love layEmbed
