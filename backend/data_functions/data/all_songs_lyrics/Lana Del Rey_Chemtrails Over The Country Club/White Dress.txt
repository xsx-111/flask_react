White Dress Lyrics
Sun stare, don't care with my head in my hands
Thinking of a simpler time
Like Sun Ra, feel small
But I had it under control every time

When I was a waitress wearing a white dress
Look how I do this, look how I got this
I was a waitress working the night shift
You were my man, felt like I got this
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

Summer, sizzling
Listening to jazz out on the lawn
Listеning to White Stripes when thеy were white-hot
Listening to rock all day long

When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress handling the heat
I wasn't famous, just listening to Kings of Leon to the beat
Like look at how I got this, look how I got this
Just singing the street
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I felt free 'cause I was only nineteen
Such a scene
Summer, summer's almost gone
We were talking about life, we were sitting outside 'til dawn
But I would still go back
If I could do it all again, I thought
Because it made me feel, made me feel like a god
'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god
Somehow it made me feel, made me feel like a god

When I was a waitress wearing a white dress
Look how I do this, look how I got this
When I was a waitress working the night shift
You were my man, felt like I got this
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress
Like, look how I do it, look how I got this
I was a waitress wearing a tight dress
Like, look how I do this, look how I got this
It made me feel, made me feel like a god
It kinda makes me feel, like maybe I was better off
'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god
It kinda makes me feel, like maybe I was better off55Embed
