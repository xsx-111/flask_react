Breaking Up Slowly Lyrics
Breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing

Are these my good years or do I have none?
Are there really good years for everyone?
I don't wanna live with a life of regret
I don't wanna end up like Tammy Wynette

'Cause breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to bе lonely, but it's the right thing to do

Georgе got arrested out on the lawn
We might be breakin' up after this song
Will he still love me long after I'm gone?
Or did he see it comin' all along?

'Cause breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely (Baby, breakin' up is hard to do)
Breakin' up slowly (Baby, breakin' up is hard to do)
Breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing to do26Embed
