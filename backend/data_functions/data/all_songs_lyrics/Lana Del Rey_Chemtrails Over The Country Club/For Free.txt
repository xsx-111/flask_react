For Free Lyrics
I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shoppin' today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from their school
I was standin' on a noisy corner
Waitin' for the walkin' green
Across the street, he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

Now me, I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black Limousine and two gentlemen
Who escort me through these halls
And I'll play if you've got the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one-man band by thе quick lunch stand
He's been playin' real good for free

Nobody stopped to hеar him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on the TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signal changed
He was playin' real good for free17Embed
