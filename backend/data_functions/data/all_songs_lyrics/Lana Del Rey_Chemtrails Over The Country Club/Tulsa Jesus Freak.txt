Tulsa Jesus Freak Lyrics
You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for the can of Gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

You should come back to our place, baby
Don't be afraid of our love
On the second floor, darling
In a second flat, hurry up
'Cause down in Arkansas the stores are all closed
The kids in their hoodies, they dance super slow
We're white-hot forever and only God knows

You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for the can of Gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind
We'll be white-hot forever (Forever, forever)
White-hot forever (Forever, forever)
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, amen

Could I come back to the ranch, baby?
I had to get away for a while
Just to rest my nerves, darling
Can I make you laugh with a smile?
You knew when you chose me
I was nothing but ordinary
And now the wind's blowing, reminding you of what you know

You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for that can of Gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

We'll be white-hot forever (Forever, forever)
White-hot forever (Together, together)
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, the end
White-hot forever (Forever, forever)
White-hot forever (Together, together)
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, amen
You should stay real close to Jesus
If you don't pray, you'll never learn
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
I like living here
Trade this body for the can of Gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind38Embed
