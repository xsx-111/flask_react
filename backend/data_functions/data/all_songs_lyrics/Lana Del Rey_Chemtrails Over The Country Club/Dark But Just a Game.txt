Dark But Just a Game Lyrics
"It's dark, but just a game"
That's what he would say to me
The faces aren't the same, but their stories all end tragically
(Sweet or whatever, baby)
And that's the price of fame
A tale as old as time you'd be (Sweet or whatever, baby)
A pretty little fool to think exceptions to the rule
Just walk around like you and me, this way
But life is sweet or whatever, baby
You gotta take them for what they got
And while the whole world is crazy
We're getting high in the parking lot

Wе keep changing all the time
The bеst ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game

It's dark, but just a game
So play it like a symphony
You know our love's the same, they'll both go down in infamy
I was a pretty little thing and God, I loved to sing
But nothing came from either one but pain (But fuck it)
Life is sweet or whatever, baby
Don't ever think it's not
While the whole world is crazy
We're making out in the parking lot
We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just—39Embed
