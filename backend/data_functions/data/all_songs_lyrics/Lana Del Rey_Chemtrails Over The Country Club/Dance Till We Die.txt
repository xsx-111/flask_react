Dance Till We Die Lyrics
I'm coverin' Joni and I'm dancin' with Joan
Stevie is callin' on the telephone
Court almost burned down my home
But God, it feels good not to be alone

But sometimes, this ranch feels like my only friend
And life doesn't always work out like we planned
We keep it movin', babe

So we made it back in the middle of the night
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

Troubled by my circumstancе
Burdened by the wеight of fame
Clementine's not just a fruit
It's my daughter's chosen name

And when all the bars close down tonight
There's one that stays open just for us, alright
We keep dancin', babe
So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep dancin', babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep it movin', babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

I went down to Woodside
I left Berkeley, out of city, out of mind
Killin' it, talkin' shit, Joan said she was gonna quit
Tearin' it up at the Afro-Caribbean two-step
I left San Francisco
I've been coverin' Joni and I'm dancin' with Joan
It's kinda hard to find love
When you're used to rollin' like a rollin' stone

So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep it movin', babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep dancin', babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die24Embed
