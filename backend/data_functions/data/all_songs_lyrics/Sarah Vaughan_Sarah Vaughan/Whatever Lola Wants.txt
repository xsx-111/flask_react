Whatever Lola Wants Lyrics
Whatever Lola wants
Lola gets
And little man little Lola wants you
Make up your mind to have (Your mind to have)
No regrets (No regrets)
Recline yourself, resign yourself, you're through

I always get what I aim for
And your heart and soul is what I came for

Whatever Lola wants (Lola wants)
Lola gets (Lola gets)
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win
(can't win, you'll never, never win)
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible, you fool
Give in (Give in, you'll never win)

Whatever Lola wants (Lola wants)
Lola gets (Lola gets)
I always get (What, what, what)
What I aim for (What, what)
And your heart and soul is what I came for

Whatever Lola wants (Lola wants)
Lola gets (Lola gets)
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win
(Can't win, you'll never, never win)
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible, you fool
Give in (Give in you'll never win)

Give in (Give in you'll never win)
Give inEmbed
