How Important Can It Be? LyricsIts the wrong time and the wrong place
Though your face is charming its the wrong face
Its not his face, but such a charming face
That its all right with me
Its the wrong song in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely its the wrong smile
Its not his smile, but such a lovely smile
That its all right with me
Chorus:
You can't know how happy I am that we met
Im strangely attracted to you
There is someone Im trying so hard to forget
Dont you want to forget someone to?
Repeat chorus
Its the wrong game, with the wrong chips
Though you lips are tempting theyre the wrong lips
Theyre not his lips but theyre such Tempting lips
That if some night you are free
Well its all right, yes its all right
Baby dont you know its all right with meEmbed
