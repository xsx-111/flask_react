Make Yourself Comfortable LyricsMmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable, baby
I've got some records here
To put you in the mood
The phone is off the hook
So no one can intrude
I feel romantic
And the record changes automatic, baby
Sweetheart, we hurried through our dinner
Hurried through the dance
Left before the picture show was through
Why did we hurry through the dinner
And hurry through the dance?
To leave some time for this
To hug a hug and kiss a kiss now
Take off your shoesies, dear
And loosen up your tie
I've got some records here
Let's try one on for size
I'll turn the lights low
While you make yourself comfortable, baby
We hurried through our dinner, Hurried through the dance
Left before the picture show was through
Why did we hurry through our dinner
Hurry through the dance
To leave some time for this
To hug-a hug-a kiss and so now
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable, babyEmbed
