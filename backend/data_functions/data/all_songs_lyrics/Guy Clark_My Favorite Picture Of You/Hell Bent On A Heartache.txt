Hell Bent On A Heartache Lyrics
Ain't love funny?
Ain't love strange?
I say love is a dangerous game
Shows no mercy
It has no rules
It's all the same for the kings and fools

And I'm hell bent on a heartache
I should know better
But I guess I don't
I keep on learning the hard way
Every time I turn around
I make the same mistake
Cause I'm hell bent on a heartache
Hell bent on a heartache

Seems I'm always getting burned
Just you wait until the table is turned
Love's a gamble
Love's a curse
Love's a bitch
But it could be worse

Don't get me wrong
I believe in love
Sometimes that's just not enough
