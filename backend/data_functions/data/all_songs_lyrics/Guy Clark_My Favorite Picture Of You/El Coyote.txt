El Coyote Lyrics
In the town of Reynosa, there's a beautiful river
That shines in the Mexico sun
There are boats and they cross from one side to the other
At dusk when the hot day is done
From there to Acuña to Del Rio, Texas
You valley up through San Antone
With the pesos I've saved up for years then I'll trade
For the chance to send dollars back home

Coyote, coyote, qué hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun
Coyote, qué hiciste cabron?

He steps out of the shadows, he won't look in my eyes
His hand's out to take all I've got
He says that he's smuggled a thousand good men
And he says that he's never been caught
So with seventeen other, braceros like cattle
Packed in for that long final ride
In the semi-truck crossing the border it's dark
And it's hot as an oven inside
Coyote, coyote, qué hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun
Coyote, qué hiciste cabron?

The braceros are asking in whispers
Why the truck stopped in the heat of the day?
At first sign of trouble, he's left us all there
By the road and he's walking away

Coyote, coyote, qué hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun
Coyote, qué hiciste cabron?Embed
