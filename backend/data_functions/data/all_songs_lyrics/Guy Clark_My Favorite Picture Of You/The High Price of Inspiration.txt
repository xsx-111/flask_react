The High Price of Inspiration Lyrics
The mirror's stained with dirty looks;
At least it never lies
The muse is calling down the hall
Come on, let's get high
The high price of inspiration
Always leaves me broken
But I keep coming back for more
Still I take no caution

Inspiration with some wings
Is what I'm looking for
Inspiration with no strings
I'd like that even more

I'll fly me to a better place
Plan this safe and sound
Don't you worry, I'll be back
If I ever become tense
Pretty sure I'll make it
If I get through today
Or I'll see tomorrow
There is always hell to pay

I'd like that even moreEmbed
