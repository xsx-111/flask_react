My Favorite Picture of You Lyrics
My favorite picture of you
Is the one where you're staring
Straight into the lens

It's just a Polaroid shot
Someone took on the spot
No beginning no end
It's just a moment in time
You can't have back
You never left but your bags were packed
Just in case
My favorite picture of you
Is bent and faded
And it's pinned to my wall
Oh, and you were so angry
It's hard to believe
We were lovers at all
There's a fire in your eyes
You've got your heart on your sleeve
A curse on your lips, but all I can see
Is beautiful
My favorite picture of you
Is the one where
Your wings are showing
Oh, and your arms are crossed
Your fists are clenched
Not gone but going
Just a stand up angel
Who won't back down
Nobody's fool, nobody's clown
You were smarter than that
My favorite picture of you
Is the one where
It hasn't rained yet
Oh and as I recall
Came a winter squall
And we got soaking wet
It's a thousand words
In the blink of an eye
The camera loves you
And so do I
Click

My favorite picture of you
Is the one where you're staring
Straight into the lensEmbed
