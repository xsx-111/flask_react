Waltzing Fool Lyrics
The waltzing fool
He's got lights in his fingers
The waltzing fool
He just don't never say
But the waltzing fool
He keeps his hands in his pockets
And waltzes the evening away

It's a waltz to a woman
Who's lying beside you
It's a waltz to a face on the wall
When she's gone
It's a waltz to the rodeo
The damned thing, it rides him
It's a waltz to a waltz

The waltzing fool
He just might be crazy
The waltzing fool
He keeps the moon in his car
And the waltzing fool
He says it's running
On waltzes and waltzes

It's a waltz to a woman
Who's lying beside you
It's a waltz to a face on the wall
When she's gone
It's a waltz to the rodeo
The damned thing, it rides him
It's a waltz to a waltz

Now the waltzing fool
They say he's been drinking
But the waltzing fool
He's got mud on his boots
And the waltzing fool
He knows they're all thinking
He's only an old waltzing fool

The waltzing fool
He's got lights in his fingers
The waltzing fool
He just don't never say
But the waltzing fool
He keeps his hands in his pockets
And waltzes the evening away
The waltzing fool
His hands in his pockets
He's waltzing the evening awayEmbed
