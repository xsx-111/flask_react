Rain in Durango Lyrics
She's a long way from Houston
Long way from those Texas blues
And she came down from Telluride
On a steam train bound for somewhere new
There's a rainbow in the mountains
And she's waiting on the sun to shine on through
You can't tell the tears from the rain
If you ain't walked a mile in her boots

Standing in the rain in Durango
Right side of wrong, wrong side of gone
Standing in the rain in Durango
She's waiting on some cowboy
To lasso her heart and take her home

Fell in with some field hippies
Went needle dancing in a tie dye dress
Then a Rocky Mountain rain came
And they all got soaking wet
She wound up with a backstage pass
Hanging with the pickers in the band
Until her heart got broke by a banjo man
Now she's had all the bluegrass she can stand
She had all of her belongings
In a cardboard suitcase sitting by her side
And she had no destination
She was just looking for a ride
So he pulled up in a Mustang
She got in and they just rode away
Headed west into the sunset
Mascara running down her face

She had all of her belongings
In a cardboard suitcase sitting by her side
And she had no destination
She was just looking for a ride
So he pulled up in a Mustang
She got in and they just rode away
Headed west into the sunset
Mascara running down her face

Standing in the rain in DurangoEmbed
