Heroes Lyrics
He brought the war home with him
Still got sand in his boots
He's wrestling with the demons
In the cold, hard truth
As some may write about him
He came back different
Something in his eyes
Said he'd seen to much
Something in his legs
Said he'd had enough

Heroes, everybody needs heroes
Even heroes need a little help
Heroes can't always be heroes
Who's going to save the hero from himself?

Got a picture from Bagdad
Of him and his buddies
And his horsing around, getting ready
One by one, he watched them die
Just scared kids, and he don't know why
He's the only one to make it out alive

Ten thousand clicks away in his head
He can smell the smoke
He could smell the dead
Silver Star and a pistol in a drawer
Morphine just ain't working no more
