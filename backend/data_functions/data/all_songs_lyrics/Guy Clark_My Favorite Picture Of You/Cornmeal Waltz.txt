Cornmeal Waltz Lyrics
There's nothing like cornmeal
On a dance-hall floor
For dancing the night away
Slipping and sliding
Effortlessly gliding
In the arms of my sweet Lillie Mae
So I shined up my boots
And ironed my shirt
And pulled on some new blue jeans
Oh, I brushed off my hat
Slicked back my hair;
I'll beat all that she's ever seen

There's nothing like listening
To the fiddles play
While doing the cornmeal waltz
There's nothing to keep you
From drifting away
Doing the cornmeal waltz

Way out on Ranch Road 17
There's a dance hall
In the live-oak trees
Yellow lights strung up all around
So all the little kids can see
Pick-ups are parked near to the road;
The beer is so cold it might freeze
Stars are all out, the band's in tune
And it smells like a barbecue breeze

Beat-up old Stetsons, beehive hair
Belt buckles bumping in time
There's little girls
Dancing on their daddies toes
Spinning around on a dime
Grandma and Grandpa are out on the floor
Dancing like they've lost their minds
There's old maids and bachelors
And sweethearts alike
All moving in three-quarter time
