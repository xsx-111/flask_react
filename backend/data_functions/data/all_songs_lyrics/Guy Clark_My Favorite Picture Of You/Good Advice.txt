Good Advice Lyrics
In one ear and out the other
Just like talking to your mother
If it's not one thing, it's another
That you can count on
I've heard it all more than once
Not again, oh Jesus Christ
The funny thing about good advice is
Everybody's got some

Good advice is hard to take
Bad habits are hard to break
Good sense is hard to make
Good advice is hard to take

Life's such a bitter pill
Swallow it down with a shot of pride
And as pebble just step outside
They say no turn can run and hide
You gotta draw the line somewhere
Don't give me no advice?
I've heard it all a thousand times
Don't start bridging between the lines
Give me something I can use
Good advice is hard to take
Bad habits are hard to break
Good sense is hard to make
Good advice is hard to take
Good advice is hard to take
Bad habits are hard to break
Good sense is hard to make
Good advice is hard to takeEmbed
