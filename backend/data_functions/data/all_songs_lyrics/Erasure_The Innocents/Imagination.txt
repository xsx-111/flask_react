Imagination LyricsWhat do you do with yourself
When you see the storm clouds rising?
Feeling alone with yourself
As the sun fades away
The memories come to and fro
The trouble is they never want to go
They come, never go
Imagination
It's just your imagination rolling over the past
It can change your mind completely
It's just my imagination running wild and too fast
But I know it won't defeat me
Look into the eyes of Medusa
And she'll turn your world to stone
She'll tear at your eyes and seduce you
And your soul will be gone
The messages and hidden dreams
Of former lives and lovers never seen
A love never seen
Imagination
It's just your imagination rolling over the past
It can change your mind completely
It's just my imagination running wild and too fast
But I know it won't defeat me
What do you do with yourself
When you're lost on some horizon?
Taking a hold of yourself
When you know the timing's wrong
The memories come to and fro
The trouble is they never want to go
Imagination
It's just your imagination rolling over the past
It can change your mind completely
It's just my imagination running wild and too fast
But I know it won't defeat me
It's just your imagination rolling over the past
It can change your mind completely
It's just my imagination running wild and too fast
But I know it won't defeat me
And I know it won't defeat meEmbed
