Phantom Bride LyricsShe was a shy girl from the lonely streets
She had no job to do, no friends to meet
She'd sit in silence in her empty room
Dream of her childhood and invented truths
And in her mind she'd drift away
A secret place to steal away
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears from your eyes
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears from your eyes
He was a good boy from the other side of town
Said he could treat her right, said he could win her 'round
Her morning sickness and the kick inside
The phantom kisses of the phantom bride
And in her mind she'd drift away
A secret place to steal away
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears from your eyes
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the teardrops from your eyes
And in her mind she'd drift away
A secret place to steal away
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears from your eyes
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears
No more, no more lies
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears from your eyes
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears
No more, no more lies
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears from your eyes
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears
Let me wipe away the tearsEmbed
