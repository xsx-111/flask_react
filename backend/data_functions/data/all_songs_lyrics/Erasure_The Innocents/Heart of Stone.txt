Heart of Stone LyricsI cry for your heart of stone
I'm gonna wait until you come home
Why am I all alone?
I'm as good as dead, yeah
Ooh, I lost my sense of passion and direction
To protect myself from hurting and despair
Listen to my heart, my soul is aching
Fool or saint? 'Cause you went and left me and you so upset me
I can't believe that you would ever find it easy
To walk away as if you'd never really cared
Did you expect that I'd give in and beg for mercy
Out in the gutter? Out in the gutter?
I cry for your heart of stone
I'm gonna wait until you come home
Why am I all alone?
I'm as good as dead, yeah
Ooh, I look back on the first night with affection
And if you had a heart, you'd remember too
The way we used to run around like little children
Fool or saint? My mother told me you'd be no good for me
I cry for your heart of stone
I'm gonna wait until you come home
Why am I all alone?
I'm as good as dead, yeah
Listen to my heart, my soul is aching
Out in the gutter
I've got to break that heart of stone
I cry for your heart of stone
I'm gonna wait until you come home
Why am I all alone?
I'm as good as dead, yeah
I cry for your heart of stone
I'm gonna wait until you come home
Why am I all alone?
I'm as good as dead, yeah
I cry for your heart of stone
I'm gonna wait until you come home
Why am I all alone?Embed
