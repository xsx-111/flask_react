Ship of Fools Lyrics
I can't believe what is happening to me
My head is spinning
The flowers and the trees are encapsulating me
And I go spinning

He was the baby of the class you know
He really didn't know that one and one was two
Two and two were four
He was the baby of the class, you know
He really didn't know that
Really didn't know that
Oh, what a poor soul

Ooh, do we not sail on a ship of fools?
Ooh, why is life so precious and so cruel?

I close my eyes and I try to imagine
What you're dreaming
Why can't you see what you're doing to me?
My world is spinning

You were the baby of the class, you know
You really didn't know that one and one was two
Two and two were four
You were the baby of the class
You were so young and so uncertain
Suffer little children
Oh, what a poor soul
Ooh, do we not sail on a ship of fools?
Ooh, why is life so precious and so cruel?


He was the baby of the class, you know
He really didn't know that one and one was two
Two and two were four
He was the baby of the class
He was so young and so uncertain
Suffer little children
Oh, what a poor soul

Ooh, do we not sail on a ship of fools?
Ooh, why is life so precious and so cruel?

Ooh, do we not sail on a ship of fools?
Ooh, why is life so fragile and so cruel?
Ooh, do we not sail on a ship of fools?
Ooh, why is life so precious and so cruel?
Ooh, do we not sail on a ship of fools?Embed
