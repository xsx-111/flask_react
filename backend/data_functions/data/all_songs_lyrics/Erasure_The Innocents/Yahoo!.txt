Yahoo! LyricsBetter that the devil should not be called
If you wanna wed the devil's daughter
I pray to the Lord on high to set you free
Better you decide to cut him loose
Than to ride on the cunning line
I pray to the Lord on high to rescue me
No one should go through hard times
No one should live in sorrow
Gotta face the darker sky
Gotta lift your head up high
Yahoo! Aah
Higher, higher, higher
Yahoo! Aah
Find your way unto the Lord, aah
Higher, higher, higher
Yahoo! Aah
Find your way unto the Lord
To run where the devil would fear to tread
Got to put your money where your heart is
I pray to the Lord on high to set you free
Whether you decide to trade your soul
For a little of the devil's gold
I pray to the Lord on high to rescue me
No one should feel so low down
And give in to sweet temptation
Gotta lift your head up high
Gotta face the darker skies
Yahoo! Aah
Higher, higher, higher
Yahoo! Aah
Find your way unto the Lord, aah
Higher, higher, higher
Yahoo! Aah
Find your way unto the Lord
Yahoo! Aah
Higher, higher, higher
Yahoo! Aah
Find your way unto the Lord
When you look around and find yourself
Between the devil and deep blue sea
I pray to the Lord on high to set you free
If there's trouble on your mind when you sleep at night
Would you come and put your trust in me?
I pray to the Lord on high to rescue me
No one should go through hard times
No one should live in sorrow
Gotta face the darker sky
Gotta lift your head up high
Yahoo! Aah
Higher, higher, higher
Yahoo! Aah
Find your way unto the Lord, aah
Higher, higher, higher
Yahoo! Aah
Find your way unto the Lord, aah
Higher, higher, higher
Yahoo! Aah
Find your way unto the Lord, aah
Higher, higher, higher
Yahoo! Aah
Find your way unto the LordEmbed
