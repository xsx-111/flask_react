Witch in the Ditch Lyrics
No, I would never step into your shoes
I'll dance in my chamber without you
I'm looking, I'm praying for a place I can dwell in
A place where our love can be true

Yes it was you, my love
That made me turn around
Yes it was you, Mein Herr
That turned me upside-down

Were we never to be forgotten?
Lay down your sweet head and cry
We'll live in dreamland tonight
Oh, come all ye who are faithful
Lay down your sweet head and cry
Enter the valley of light

Just watch this witch dig her heels in the ditch
As the ministry waves her goodbye
Wake from the dream with a start and a scream
And the prisoner gives out a sigh
Yes it was you, mein Schatz
That made me turn around

Were we never to be forgotten?
Lay down your sweet head and cry
We'll live in dreamland tonight
Oh, come all ye who are faithful
Lay down your sweet head and cry
Enter the valley of light

Yes it was you, my love
That made me turn around
Yes it was you, Mein Herr
That turned me upside-down

Were we never to be forgotten?
Lay down your sweet head and cry
We'll live in dreamland tonight
Oh, come all ye who are faithful
Lay down your sweet head and cry
Enter the valley of light
Were we never to be forgotten?
Lay down your sweet head and cry
We'll live in dreamland tonight
Oh, come all ye who are faithful
Lay down your sweet head and cry
Enter the valley of light
(Let me upside-down...)Embed
