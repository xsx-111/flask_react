Weight of the World Lyrics
Hey little wise man
You got the sweetest notion
(Ooh, the sweetest thing)
Just once in a lifetime
You need a helping hand
(Ooh, a helping hand)

You keep it wrapped up inside
It's like a lethal potion
(Gonna find it soul-destroying)

Woah, don't take it any further now baby
Woah, won't lead you anywhere
Woah, it's pushing and a-hurting you baby
Woah, I'll say a little prayer

No other wise man
Could take the hurt like you do (Ooh, the pain like you)
Putting on a brave face
But it gets to you somehow (Ooh, gets through somehow)

You hold your head in your hands
And the weight of the world on your shoulders
(Come and pour your heart out to me)
Woah, don't take it any further now baby
Woah, won't lead you anywhere
Woah, it's pushing and a-hurting you baby
Woah, I'll say a little prayer


You keep it wrapped up inside
It's like a lethal potion
(Gonna find it soul-destroying)

Woah, don't take it any further now baby
Woah, won't lead you anywhere
Woah, it's pushing and a-hurting you baby
Woah, I'll say a little prayer

(Woah) Don't take it any further now baby
Woah, won't lead you anywhere
Woah, it's pushing and a-hurting you baby
Woah, I'll say a little prayer
(Woah) Don't take it any further now baby
Woah, won't lead you anywhereEmbed
