River Deep, Mountain High (Private Dance Mix) LyricsWhen I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
The only doll I ever owned
Now I love you just the way
I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger in every way
It gets deeper, love it stays
It gets higher until our day
And, do I love you, my, oh, my?
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
When you were a young boy
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around?
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I'll never let you down
'Cause it goes on and on
Like a river flows
It gets bigger baby, heaven knows
It gets sweeter baby, as it grows
And, do I love you, my, oh, my?
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby, baby
And, do I love you, my, oh, my?
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby, baby
When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
The only doll I ever owned
Now I love you just the way
I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper, love it stays
And it gets higher until our day
And, do I love you, my, oh, my? Yeah
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring
I love you baby like a robin loves to sing
And I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his bag
I love you baby, river deep, mountain high
Ahh river deep
Ahh river deep
Ahh river deep
Ahh river deep
And, do I love you, my, oh, my?
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby, babyEmbed
