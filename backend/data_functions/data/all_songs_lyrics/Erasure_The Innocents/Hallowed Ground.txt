Hallowed Ground LyricsEverybody's intent on killing someone
The streets are closed and there's a kid on the run
The bullets scream out from gun to gun
Everybody's intent on being someone
The cold and darkness of the criminal dawn
Wrapped in blankets, gotta keep themselves warm
A child in the arms of a teenage mum
Who will be there, who will be the next victim of the criminal dawn?
Old friends meet on the edge of town
Sharing conversation, hoping things'll soon get better
While the children meet, got the world at their feet
Not knowing what's around the corner
Are we living for an uncertain future?
Down by the corner sits a broken man
Lives by the bottle, swears never again
Lost his money on the dogs and gin
He looks for his supper in garbage can
The kids hang around by the old school ground
Right by the river where the body was found
Throwing stones on hallowed ground
Who will be there, who will be the next victim of the criminal dawn?
Old friends meet on the edge of town
Sharing conversation, hoping things'll soon get better
While the children meet, got the world at their feet
Not knowing what's around the corner
Are we living for an uncertain future?
Can you hear them calling?
In the cold and darkness of the criminal dawn
Wrapped in blankets, gotta keep ourselves warm
A child in the arms of a teenage mum
Who will be there, who will be the last victim of the criminal dawn?
Old friends meet on the edge of town
Sharing conversation, hoping things'll soon get better
While the children meet, got the world at their feet
Not knowing what's around the corner
Are we living for an uncertain future?
Old friends meet on the edge of town
Sharing conversation, hoping things'll soon get better
While the children meet, got the world at their feet
Not knowing what's around the corner
Are we living for an uncertain future?Embed
