When I Needed You (Melancholic mix) LyricsI'd like to be a child again
So many things to do
Playground noise and coloured toys
Everything brand new
I'd like to be a pirate ship
In search of hidden gold
On ocean waves that swim away
And sail around the world
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
I'd like to be a soldier
A general I would be
In battle and in glory
With ten thousand men to lead
I could be most anything
There is so much to see
I'd live a different story
If you were next to me
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
I could be most anything
There is so much to see
I'd live a different story
If you were next to me
Where?
Where?
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend?
Where (where), where were you
When I needed you most?Embed
