Oh yeah he gives a shit about that. Just trying to be realistic, that’s the whole thing. Who knew?
Oh here he comes. Yeah it’s about time to go down, he went to the bathroom with that cute thing and it’s new
Ten cents! Ten cents! Ten cents! Fifteen cents? Take it out
You're no good
Oh you're no good
You're no good
Oh you're no good
To me
You're no fun
Oh you're no fun
Say it to me
Say it to me
Hit on me
Oh say it to me
You're no good
Oh you're no good
To me
You're no fun
You're no fun
Say it to me
In the dream
Baby if you love me, I might destroy you
Baby if you love me, I'll pull it for you
Baby if you want me, I'm making sure you
Baby if you want me, I'll keep it for you
Again!
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby!
She never l-l-l-l-loved me
She loved me, no
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Hit on me
Hit on me
You're not good
Oh you're no good
To me
You're not the one
Oh you're no good
To me
Hey yeah

She l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-loved
Okay!
She l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-loved
