Picture Me Gone LyricsLet's make a toast to glory days
When you were 8 and I was only 41
I dedicate this selfie to the little guy
Who will outlast me when I'm done
Look into my camera lens
And straight through me I see that you're a lot like me
You never get attention
And you never get a pension
Or your dad's money
Picture me gone
I backed up all my pictures on my iCloud so you can't see me when I die
I left my body somewhere down in Mexico
Give "Find My iPhone" app a try
Let's make a toast to glory days
When you were 8 and I was only 45
I dedicate this selfie to the little guy
Who will outlast me when I'm done
Picture me gone3Embed
