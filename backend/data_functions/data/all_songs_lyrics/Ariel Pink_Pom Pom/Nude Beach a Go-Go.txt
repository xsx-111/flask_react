Nude Beach a Go-Go LyricsSkin game overload
Skin game overload
Skin game overload
Skin game overload
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
You can do anything at
Nude beach a go-go
Fram-a-lama ding dong
Surfer Billy bing bong
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
You can tag along
If you're young and strong
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
All the kids will be in traction
All the parents don't like the action
But when we jingle jingle jingle jangle
Everybody does the bingle bangle
(Ow!)
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
Don't you don't you know know
Suntan and the snow snow
Everybody goes where the roses bloom
Come and enjoy the living rooms
By the lifeguard stationed by the coral reef
That's where all the nude kids cut their teeth
There's no clothes to wear
And no bow ties ever care
And chiffon and silk and wool and cotton
They are all forgotten
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
All the kids
Everybody
Everybody
Nude beach a go-go
Nude beach a go-go
Don't you don't you know know
Suntan and the snow snow
Everybody goes where the roses bloom
Come and enjoy the living rooms
By the lifeguard stationed by the coral reef
That's where all the nude kids cut their teeth
There's no clothes to wear
And no bow ties ever care
And chiffon and silk and wool and cotton
They are all forgotten
At nude beach a go-go, ah!Embed
