Black Ballerina LyricsDowntown
Late nights
Young girls have
Small bras
New wave
You freak
You look good
Chest out
Big struts
Chin up, girl
Let your freak flag fly
Pin-up girl
One-eyed Willy
Get self hot
Shotgun Billy
Getting stuck
C-String Sally
What the hell
If that don't please ya
It's just as well

Come on don your doggy collar
Bet your bottom dollar
Come on take your bra and panties off
Yeah, juicy Belladonna
Pardon Mrs. Dolly Parton
Condoleezza, turn me on and
Bet your bottom dollar that
Ten dollars all I gots to spend

Black ballerina, black ballerina
Elevators, manufacturers
What goes up, must come down
Black ballerina, black ballerina
Elevators, manufacturers
She's too hot, pin-up girl
Black ballerina, black ballerina
Elevators, manufacturers

One-Eyed Willy: Okay Billy, come over here a minute
Shotgun Billy: Uh, okay...
One-Eyed Willy: I gotta introduce you to one of me friends
Shotgun Billy: Uh, really?
One-Eyed Willy: I think you're gonna like her, Billy
Shotgun Billy: Oh, she's a girl? Uh, I don't know about this...
One-Eyed Willy: Yes, she's a topless dancer, lad
Shotgun Billy: What?
One-Eyed Willy: C'mon now, don't be frightened
C-String Sally: Hi Billy. How do you like the number one strip club in L.A.?
Shotgun Billy: It's okay, I guess...um....
One-Eyed Willy: Yeah, that's right....
C-String Sally: Yeah, I'll take it from here
One-Eyed Willy: Yes! Yes!
Shotgun Billy: Uh, I like your areolas, baby
C-String Sally: Hands off buster, what the fuck was that?!
Shotgun Billy: I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
C-String Sally: What the fuck are you doing, man?

Come on don your doggy collar
Bet your bottom dollar
Come on take your bra and panties off
Yeah, juicy Belladonna
Pardon Mrs. Dolly Parton
Condoleezza, turn me on and
Bet your bottom Dolly rock
Ten dollars all I gots to spend

She's too hot, pin-up girl

What goes up must come down
