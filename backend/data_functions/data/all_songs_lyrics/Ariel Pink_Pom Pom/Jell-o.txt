Jell-o LyricsJello, Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello
Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello
Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello
Jello
Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello, Jell
Sticky cubes of Kool-Aid action
Liquid sky
Quick satisfaction
Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello
Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello
The strip mall
Strip mall is calling
Can you hear the people
Wearing Wal-Mart clothes
Into church steeples
Mom and Dad are normal
Everyone eats white bread
That's why they're all dead
Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello
Yeah
Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello
Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello
Jello
Jello, Jello, Jello, Jello, Jell
I, I, I, I eat Jello
I, I, I, I eat corn
I, I, I, I eat Jello
Before I was an embryo
That's why I was born
I believe in reincarnation
That's why I eat Jello
It's good for the stomach
In Jerry's delicatessen down on Santa Monica boulevard you can get the best Jello in town1Embed
