Four Shadows Lyrics
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi

Four shadows hang lifeless from gallows of time
Banished from heaven
Etched into dimensionless life
Four shades silhouetted engraved marble slab
Perched on their pillars of stacked severed limbs made of wax

There in the afterglow
Keep your eyes on the dream
In the theater of endless freefall
We're between what's to come
And what always is and shall not be

In the night
Only darkness in the night
Things that go bump in the night
Only darkness in the night
Only darkness in the night
Things that go bump in the night
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi

Four shadows eclipsing the rays of the sun
Blacker than black colors
That overlap in the sky
Four shadows in two dimensional screens
Nothing to touch when the movie projector is me

Etheric vertigo!
Don't believe what you see
Through the eyelids of sin, we did fall
And between what's to come
Ultraviolet and infrared

In the night
Only darkness in the night
Things that go bump in the night
Only darkness sinks at night
Only darkness in the night
Things that go bump in the night
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oiEmbed
