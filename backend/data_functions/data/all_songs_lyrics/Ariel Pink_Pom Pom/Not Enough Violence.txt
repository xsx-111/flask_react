Not Enough Violence LyricsTime is up, your doomsday clock sealed
Carry the cross, boy, and make your bed
In a place where all is unknown
Face behind the mask of the sky
Halfway spinning to a better place
In the body of a man, mind of a girl
What's the view like from your bed?
Where a handful of love goes down where you got fed
And now it's time for pain, that's right
Now it's time for pain, that's right
Penetration time tonight
Penetration...
When we power plant bodies
Are we power plant bodies?
Are we power plant bodies? (On the body farm)
Are we power plant bodies? (On the body farm)
Providence of angels and ferrymen
Here after all's well and said is done
What's the view like from your bed?
Where a handful of love goes down where you got fed
Now it's time for pain, that's right
Penetration time tonight
Not enough violence
You're fertilizer! Fertilizer! (On the body farm)
Not enough violence
You're fertilizer! Fertilizer! (On the body farm)
Not enough violence
You're fertilizer! Fertilizer! (On the body farm)
Not enough violence
You're fertilizer! Fertilizer! (On the body farm)
Carnage, violence, carnage, violence
You're fertilizer! Fertilizer! (On the body farm)
Not enough violence
You're fertilizer! Fertilizer! (On the body farm)
Not enough violence
Are we power plant bodies? (On the body farm)
Not enough violence
You're fertilizer! Fertilizer! (On the body farm)
Not enough violence
You're fertilizer!
Halfway spinning to a better place
In the body of a man
Are we power plant bodies? (On the body farm)
Are we power plant bodies? (On the body farm)
Are we power plant bodies? (On the body farm)
Body farm
Body farm (Mind of a girl)6Embed
