Put Your Number in My Phone Lyrics
There's magic in the air
The night sky drapes your face
Like a mystery left uncovered

Talk to me, it's now or never, babe
Make believe, the night last forever, babe
Come for tea, I'll be your neighbor
If you want all this and more

Put your number in my phone
Put your number in my phone
I hope to get some time alone
I wanna get to know you more
Baby, baby
Put your number in my phone
If I could get some time alone

'Cause what would tame this gypsy heart
But fruits from fresh on vine
Your luscious lips entice me to discover

Talk to me, I'll be your butterfly
Talk to me, on lover's isle
Savor me, spare us both the denial
Make the most of this true love
Put your number in my phone
Put your number in my phone
I hope to get some time alone
I wanna get to know you more
Baby, baby
Put your number in my phone
If I could get some time alone

Hey Ariel, it's Jessica
We met at the taco truck in Silver Lake
And I don't know if you're like really busy or something
But I haven't heard back from you
And I was just wondering like, if you couldâ€“

Talk to me, it's now or never, babe
Make believe, on lover's isle
Come for tea, I'll be your neighbor
If you want all this and more

Put your number in my phone
Put your number in my phone
I hope to get some time alone
I wanna get to know you more
Baby, baby
Put your number in my phone
If I could get some time alone7Embed
