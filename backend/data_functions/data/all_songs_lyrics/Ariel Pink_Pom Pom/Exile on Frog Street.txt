Exile on Frog Street LyricsBanished from the junkyard paradise
Stuck in Vegas with my loaded dice
Looks like a vacant lot and tumbleweed
Go out and try to succeed
By that highway, broken down
Exile on frog street
Exile on frog street
I'm not a gambler
They call me the rambler
I'm just a scrambler
But you know I have the style
You know that I'm an exile on frog street
Exile on frog street
I'm not a toad
I'm not a toad
I'm just a
Frog
The enchanted frog was waiting for his princess charming
To come and kiss him on his frog lips
And who'd he turn into?
Me!
(Why?)
Cause I'm the frog prince
Frog
Exile on frog street
Where all the elves two step two
So come on down to the rendezvous
