Goth Bomb LyricsWhy can't I write
Write the words down right
Why can't I write
Write the words down right
Cause I'm a goth bomb, goth bomb
Cause I'm a goth bomb, gothic Bomb
Gothic Bomb, gothic Bomb
Not an atomic bomb
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Pick me up a pinhead and turn me around
Pick me up a pinhead and turn me around
Pick me up a pinhead and turn me around
Pick me up a pinhead and turn me around

Why can't I write
Write the words out right
Why can't I write
Write the words down right
Cause I'm a goth bomb, goth Bomb
Cause I'm a gothic bomb, gothic bomb
Cause I'm a goth bomb, goth bomb
Not an atomic bomb
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Why can't I write the words
Pick me up a pinhead and turn me around
Pick me up a pinhead and turn me around
Pick me up a pinhead and turn me around
Pick me up a pinhead and turn me around
Gothic bomb
Goth bomb
Goth bomb
Goth bombEmbed
