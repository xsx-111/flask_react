Lipstick Lyrics

I'm a possum
I cross the street
I lie in wait until sundown
I saw it happen
I saw ya murder
I watched the knife as it went down
(Into the breast)
And now you're runnin' around and around
Runnin' for cover, oh oh oh
Possum discovered
Dead in the street, oh oh oh
Einstein was right

Red murder
Hidden in lipstick
Hidden in lipstick
Red murder
Hidden in love

Where are the women
Where are the men
Where are the girls
Where are the girls now
Where are the women
Where are the men
Where are the girls
Where are the girls now
I'm a hunter
I flash my teeth
I snuck you into my darkness
Tail is frozen, headlights in go over, oh oh oh
Einstein was right

Red murder
Hidden in lipstick
Hidden in lipstick
Red murder
Hidden in love
Red murder
Hidden in lipstick
Hidden in lipstick
Red murder
Hidden in love

Shower me in blood, child
Shower me in lipstick
Shower me in blood, child
Shower me in lipstick
Where are the girls
Where are the girls now
Where are the girls
Where are the girls now

Who is this?
Who am I?
What is this?
Truth is this
That implies
Truth exists
Who is this?
Who am I?
What is this?
Truth is this
That implies
Truth exists13Embed
