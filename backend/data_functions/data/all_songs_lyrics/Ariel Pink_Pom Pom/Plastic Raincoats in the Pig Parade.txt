Plastic Raincoats in the Pig Parade Lyrics
The sky was white and black and polka dotted
It must've been an Ariel day
And all of a sudden I was allotted
The chance to go with a big parade

Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Plastic raincoats in the pig parade
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Mannequins are so afraid
Don't be afraid to show your stripes
Because the mannequins is always right
Plastic raincoats in the pig parade
All over the world
Cocaine man's got the Portobello Girl
It's a Tokyo night when you feel alright
The Arkansas moon's gonna shine tonight
All over the world we're gonna do it right
So wear your plastic raincoats in the pig parade
Cause the mannequins is so afraid

The mannequins suits Lady Umbrella
March along the edge of the Thames
Then up came two or three or four Berettas
Raincoats in the big pig parade
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Wear your plastic raincoats in the pig parade
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Mannequins are so afraid
Don't be afraid to show your stripes
Because the mannequins is always right
Plastic raincoats in the pig parade
All over the world
Cocaine man's got the Portobello Girl
It's a Tokyo night when you feel alright
The Arkansas moon's gonna shine tonight
All over the world we're gonna do it right
So wear your plastic raincoats in the pig parade
Because the mannequins is so afraid

Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!4Embed
