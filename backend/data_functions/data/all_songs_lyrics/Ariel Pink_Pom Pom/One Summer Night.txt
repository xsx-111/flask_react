One Summer Night Lyrics
One summer night I will call you up
And on one summer night
You will fall in love
Now that you're gone
I can't go living every night
When I asked you to be mine
Ten summers back before

One summer night I will pick you up
And on one summer night
I will miss your love
Now that you're gone
I can't go living every night
When I asked you "be my bride"
Forever-ever more

Fantasies and fallacies
All fairy tales and lies
Time is running out, yeah
Better write these lines

One summer night I will call you up
And on one summer night
You will fall in love
Now that you're gone
I can't go living every night
When I asked you to be mine
Ten summers back before
Fantasies and fallacies
All fairy tales and lies
Time is running out, yeah
Better write these lines
Happy days of childlike bliss
All innocence and lies
Time is running out, yeah
Better write down these lines3Embed
