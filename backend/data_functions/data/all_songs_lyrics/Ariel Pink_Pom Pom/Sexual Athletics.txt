Sexual Athletics Lyrics(Scat style)
Do-do the walk, ai-ee-ya
Do-do-do the walk (x4)
They call it sexual athletics
It doesn't rhyme with anything
That's why I'm the sex king
Sex king on a velvet swing
Waiting for my Alice in Wonderland
To come along and knock upon my door
If I'm who you were waiting for
Cause I'm a sexual athlete
Yeah, that's right
I'm a sexual athlete
I'm sweet
Eat raw meat
Don't admit to defeat
Some say it's bittersweet
Gimme an S-E-X-U-A-L
Sexual uh Sexual uh
Gimme an S-E-X-U-A-L
Sexual uh Sexual uh
What kinda sex are you talkin' about
It's time that we scream and shout
(Hey!)
Let's go to the emotional Olympics!
(Boo!)
Ok
Sexual ugh
(Outro)
Sexual athletics, sexual athletics
Sexual diversion, don't call it perversion
And all I wanted was a girlfriend all of my life
But she's too sexual
Sexual athletics for the lucky onesEmbed
