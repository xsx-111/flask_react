Mr. Green Genes LyricsEat your greens
Don't forget your beans & celery
Don't forget to bring
Your fake I.D
Eat a bunch of these
Magnificent
With sauerkraut
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Sauerkraut!
Eat a grape, a fig
A crumpet too ...
You'll pump 'em right through
Doo-wee-ooo
Eat your shoes
Don't forget the strings
And socks
Even eat the box
You bought 'em in
You can eat the truck
That brought 'em in
Garbage truck
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMouldy
Garbage truck
Eat the truck the driver
And his gloves
Nutritiousness
DELICIOUSNESS
WORTH-LESS-NESSEmbed
