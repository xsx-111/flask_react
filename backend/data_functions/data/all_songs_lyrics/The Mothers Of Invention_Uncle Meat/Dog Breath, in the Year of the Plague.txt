Dog Breath, in the Year of the Plague LyricsPlease, hear my plea!
Cucuroo carucha (chevy '39)
Going to el monte legion stadium
Pick up on my weesa (she is so divine)
Helps me stealing hub caps
Wasted all the time
Fuzzy dice
Bongos in the back
My ship of love is
Ready to attack
Primer mi carucha (chevy '39)
Going to el monte legion stadium
Pick up on my weesa (she is so divine)
Helps me stealing hub caps
Wasted all the time
Fuzzy dice
Bongos in the back
My ship of love
Ready to attack
Won't you please hear my plea
Primer mi carucha (chevy '39)
Going to el monte legion stadium
Pick up on my weesa (she is so divine)
Helps me stealing hub caps
Wasted all the time
Fuzzy dice
Bongos in the back
My ship of love
Ready to attackEmbed
