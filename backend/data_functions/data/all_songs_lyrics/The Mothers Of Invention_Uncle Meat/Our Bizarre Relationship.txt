Our Bizarre Relationship LyricsFZ: Bizarre!
Suzy: Bizarre . . . ha ha!
No-one could ever understand our bizarre relationship
Because I was your intellectual frigid housekeeper
Especially when you'd be going to bed with one chick at night
And I wake up in the morning and find another one there, screaming at me
Asked me what the f**k that chick was doing in your bed
And I'd walk in and you weren't with the same one you were in the night before
Oh, I'll never forget that, as long as I live
That house, well it had your shit all over
And we had a cat and we had fleas and we had lots of crabs
That we proceeded to give to everyone in Laurel Canyon except for Elmer and Phil
Because they were too sick to ball
Elmer has a mentality of approximately One Peanut. Possibly
As a matter of fact, I can remember Elmer telling me that you really had a lot of talent
But he didn't see how anyone could ever make it that insisted on saying "fuck" on stage
And he used to drive by in his gold Cadillac and peer in the window
'Cause he never could get over the amount of groupie status that
That you had and he didn't
Possibly because he's 50 years old and wretchedEmbed
