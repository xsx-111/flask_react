Electric Aunt Jemima LyricsOw ow ow ow

Ow ow ow ow
Rundee rundee rundee

Electric Aunt Jemima
Goddess of Love
Khaki Maple Buckwheats
Frizzle on the stove
Queen of my heart
Please hear my plea
Electric Aunt Jemima
Cook a bunch for me
Tried to find a reason
Not to quit my job
Beat me till I'm hungry
Found a punk to rob
Love me Aunt Jemima
Love me now and ever more
Love me Aunt Jemima
Dit-dit-dit-dit dit-dit-dit-dit

Dit-dit-dit-dit ditty-ditty
Dit-dit-dit-dit dit-dit-dit-dit
Dit-dit-dit-dit ditty-ditty
Dit-dit-dit-dit dit-dit-dit-dit dit
Tried to find a raisin
Brownies in the basin
Monza by the street light
Aunt Jemima all night
Holiday and salad days
And days of moldy mayonnaise
Caress me, ah
Caress me, ah
Caress me Aunt Jemima
Caress me, ah
Caress me Aunt Jemima
Caress me, ah
Caress me Aunt Jemima
Caress me, ah
Caress me Aunt Jemima
Caress me, ah
Caress me Aunt Jemima
Mmm, boy, my lips are gettin' heavy
I can't tell when you're telling the truth
I'm not
How do I know anything you've said to me is ?
You don'tEmbed
