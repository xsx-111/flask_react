Louie Louie (at the Royal Albert Hall in London) LyricsAh! I know the perfect thing to accompany this man's trumpet
None other than- The Mighty & Majestic Albert Hall Pipe Organ!
Right!
You understand that you won't be able to hear the organ once we turn the amplifiers up
Alright, Don?
Whip it on 'em!
"Louie Louie"! They like it loud too, you know?
Let's hear again for the London Philharmonic Orchestra!Embed
