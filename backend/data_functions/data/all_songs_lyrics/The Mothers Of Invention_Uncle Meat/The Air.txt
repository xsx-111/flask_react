The Air LyricsThe air escaping from your mouth
The hair escaping from your nose
My heart escaping from the scraping
And the shaping of the draping
I'm awaking in a T-shirt
In a Chevy at the beach
And I'm freezing and I'm wheezing
And I know you were only teasing
I hit you then I beat you
Then I told you that I love you
In my car in a jar
In my car in a jar
The air escaping from your pits
The hair escaping from my teeth
My hands are gripping but they're slipping
And they're dripping 'cause I'm tripping
I got busted (wasted)
Coming through customs (I'm so wasted)
With a suitcase (wasted)
Full of tapes (I'm so wasted)
It was special
Tape recording
And they grabbed me
While I was boarding
Yes, they grabbed me then they beat me
Then they told me they don't like me
And I crashed in my Nash
We can crash in my Nash
We can crash in my Nash
We can crash in my Nash
We can crash in my NashEmbed
