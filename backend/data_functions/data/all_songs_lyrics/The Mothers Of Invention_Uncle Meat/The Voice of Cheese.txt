The Voice of Cheese Lyrics
Hello, teenage America
My name is Suzy Creemcheese
I'm Suzy Creemcheese
Because I've never worn fake eyelashes in my whole life
And I never made it on surfing set
And I never made it on beatnik set
And I couldn't cut the groupie set either
And, um
Actually I really fucked up in Europe
Now that I've done it all over
And nobody else will accept me
I've come home to my mother'sEmbed
