Feel to Follow LyricsHow was I to ever believe it
It's never too late
Until it's too late and I'll be stranded
I'll need something
Now I can see it, I can feel it
I believe it
Ever since I can remember
It's been as nothing
Until I almost feel to follow
Feel to follow
Feel to follow
Feel to follow
Feel to follow
Feel to follow
How will I ever dare to breathe it
When it's over
I've seen it in another, someone stronger
They couldn't leave it
Until I almost feel to follow
Feel to follow
Feel to follow
Feel to follow
Feel to followEmbed
