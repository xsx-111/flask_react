Ayla LyricsAimless am I
Listless I'm the blunt of the knife
Drifting to the corners of life
Ayla
I could make something right
Gentle with the kindness I'd like
So often it's a trick of the light
Ayla
And we wait for love
In the shape of us
'Til the wait is over under halcyon skies
The wait is over for an innocent life
It's a weight off my mind
I could trust you, you could tell me it's fine
I could sew you a stitch and save nine
Ayla
None more admired and
Out of soft focused desire
From honeyed milk to funeral pyre
Ayla
Ayla
And we'll wait for love
In the shape of us
But the state of us
Daedalus
The wait is over under halcyon skies
The wait is over for an innocent life
The wait is over under halcyon skies
The wait is over for an innocent life
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is overEmbed
