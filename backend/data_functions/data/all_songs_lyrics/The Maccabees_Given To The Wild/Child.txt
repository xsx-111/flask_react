Child LyricsNever as a child
Would you give this time of day
You'd take it from the shadows
And you give it another name
But now it's all that's left
Now it's all that's left
And though it awful gentle takes you
And it awful slowly leaves
It's a weight I wouldn't wish upon
And I wish I wouldn't have to wait
Now it's all that's left
Now it's all that's left
Now it's all that's left
Now it's all that's left
Never as a child
Never as a child
Now it's so vivid
Now it's so vivid
Now it's so vivid
Now it's so vivid
Given to the wild
Given to the wild away
Wide away 
Wide away, wide away, wide away
Now it's all that's left
Now it's all that's left
Now it's all that's left
Now it's all that's leftEmbed
