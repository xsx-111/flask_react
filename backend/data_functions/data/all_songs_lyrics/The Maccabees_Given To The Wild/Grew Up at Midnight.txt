Grew Up at Midnight LyricsOutside of the window
I was sticking with you
We were only kids then
We'd get soaked right through
We used to tell them
I was staying at yours
Sheltered in our own worlds
We'd watch the rain right through
We grew up at midnight
We were only kids then
We grew up at midnight
We were only kids then
Loving woman, loving man
Here for you doing the best we can
Hard to figure, hard to bare
Hard to think knowing how much you care
It's the strangest thing through thick and thin
All this time kept the promise you made
If you're telling, I'll be told
I'll come running and be there as soon as I can
Outside of the window
I was sticking with you
We were only kids then
We'd get soaked right through
We used to tell them
I was staying at yours
Sheltered in our own worlds
We'd watch the rain right through
We grew up at midnight
We were only kids then
We grew up at midnight
We were only kids then, but that night we knewEmbed
