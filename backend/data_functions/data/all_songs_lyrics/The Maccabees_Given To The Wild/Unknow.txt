Unknow LyricsLove, just while love
Just while love remembers
Just while love, just while love
Just while love remembers
Unknow
Me as hard as it seems
Decide it
And feel light on the breeze
And it's alright, you can lean it
You can lean it, you can lean it
You can lean it, you can lean it
You can lean it on me
And I know
It's all you can see
And to shake it
To make it fall from the tree
And you're called into the water
And it holds you like a tropical disease
And you lean into the weather and it drops you, it drops you
Just while love, just while love
Just while love remembers
Just while love, just while love
Just while love remembers
x2
I was given these lungs
And I won't be ashamed no more
We were ripped from those arms
They no longer protect us
Unknow me
Pour me away
Pour me, pour me, pour me away
Just while love, just while love
Just while love remembers
Just while love, just while love
Just while love remembers
x2
I was given these lungs
And I won't be ashamed no more
We were ripped from those arms
They no longer protect us
Just while love, just while love
Just while love remembers
Just while love, just while love
Just while love remembers
Just while love, just while love
Just while love remembers1Embed
