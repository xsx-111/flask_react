Glimmer LyricsWith it all before you
How could it ever go wrong
When water mirrors for you
And all that you look on
Just a glimmer
From the way beyond
But you're lost today
But you're lost today
In each and every tide
Things are lost
Things we must
Not lose sight of
No matter if you're tired
Why suppose
Oracles
Can let you know
With it all before you
How could it ever go wrong
When water mirrors for you
And all that you look on
Just a glimmer
From the way beyond
But you're lost today
But you're lost today
Between you weigh the cost
Against damage of
And shore it up
Against the flood
She's the whitest of your wave
Through it all
Through it all
Through it all
But you're lost today
But you're lost today
With this all here for you
I couldn't let it go on
Couldn't bear to carry you
Couldn't lay upon
Saw a glimmer
From the way beyond
Where we helped today
Where we helped today2Embed
