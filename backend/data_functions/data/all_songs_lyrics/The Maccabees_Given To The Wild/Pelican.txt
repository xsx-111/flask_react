Pelican Lyrics
So soon we're too old to carry
And we knew we only had a little while
In the middle just keep ticking over
Before you know it parent to parent, oh

To have it all and still want more
One things for sure: we're all getting older
So we take a lover waiting in the corner
Before you know it, we're pushing up the daisies

And we go back to where we came from
Like those before and those to come
And know its the ever and the more
And again and again and again and again

Well, in the end, nothing comes easy
So you find a way to take a little with you
For the ones you love, there if they need to
Hey pharaoh, they're not coming with you

And we go back to where we came from
Like those before and those to come
And know its the ever and the more
And again and again and again and again
So soon we're too old to carry
And we knew we only had a little while
In the middle just keep ticking over
Before you know it parent to parent, oh

And we go back to where we came from
Like those before and those to come
And know its the ever and the more
And again and again and again and againEmbed
