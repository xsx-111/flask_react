Slowly One LyricsIn every quiet moment
In every little silence
Every small reminder
Where you find her
With every left light on
Let alone
Every little loving word
Said out of love
Going cold
Little by little, by little, by little, by
Little, by little, by little, by little I'm
Laid down
Little by little, by little, by little, by
Little, by little, by little, by little I'm
Laid down
I can go wherever
Still the same
Every small reminder
Of a name
Any half measures
Any pleasures
Every new encounter
That's not her
Leaves you cold
Little by little, by little, by little, by
Little, by little, by little, by little I'm
Laid down
Little by little, by little, by little, by
Little, by little, by little, by little I'm
Laid down
Some day you're going to wake up and think you went a day without
Some day you're going to wake up and think you went a day without
Going coldEmbed
