Heave LyricsHeave another, heave another sigh
We're the last sons
Thought our heads had locked, heads have parted ways, so headstrong
We're the last sons
Are we so
Are we so
Are we so
Are we so, are we so
Are we so different
We're night and day still the same
In the garland frame
Though we left a mark upon a cherub face, signs of love
Waste it all on the young
Are we so
Are we so
Are we so
Are we so, are we so
Are we so different
Are we so
Are we so
Are we so
Are we so, are we so
Are we so differentEmbed
