Went Away LyricsLook at you with slimmer lines
Dirty toes un-showered
Unholy sight, the state of you
And every sign that you're wired again
Just look at you in the trolley line
Wild eyed you're still flying
A little less and a little more
In the middle ground you're still miles away
So hold me close, don't let me go
I need you so
Tell me something I don't know
That I need to know
Hold those arms around my neck
I need you so
Somewhere sunk behind those eyes
A man I've always known, a man I've always known
A man I've always
And if you go to sea again
We'll see it out to horizons
To see it all it's a little late
And better never but it's happening
So hold me close, don't let me go
I need you so
Somewhere sunk behind those eyes
A man I've always known, a man I've always known
That never went away
That never went away
That never went away
That never went away
Hold me close, don't let me go
I need youEmbed
