Go LyricsLeft you, left you there in, there in the sunlight
In the sunshine by the windowsill in the kitchen
In light of what was to come, it was not enough
Just like, like the cardboard, the cardboard that covered
The missing panes and cracks in our bedroom windows
We should have known they wouldn't keep out the cold, it was not enough
It's not enough
It's not enough
It's not enough and it never was
And they'll call out with a name by, a name by which I'd never call you
And we'll grow out when it's time, and the skins we've known no longer fit us
It's not enough and it leaves you tired
See you, see you there in, there in the sunlight
In the sunshine by the windowsill in the kitchen
And they'll call out with a name by, a name by which I'd never call you
All things being well still feel it was not enoughEmbed
