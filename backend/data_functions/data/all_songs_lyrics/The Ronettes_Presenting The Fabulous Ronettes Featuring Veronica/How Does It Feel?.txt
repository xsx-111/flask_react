How Does It Feel? Lyrics
How does it feel
When you're left sitting out in the cold?
How does it feel
When you don't have nobody to hold?

I wanna know
Does it really, really hurt you so?
Are you crying?
Are you dying?
Do you want her like I wanted you before?

How does it feel
To just stare at the ceiling all night?
How do you feel
Knowing someone is holding her tight?

Please tell me true
Are you really really feeling blue?
Do you miss her?
Wanna kiss her?
Do you need her like I needed you before?
When you walked out on me
I felt like you're feeling now
But I'd take you back again
'Cause I still love you, anyhow

I wanna know
Does it really really hurt you so?
Are you crying?
Are you dying?
Do you want her like I wanted you before?Embed
