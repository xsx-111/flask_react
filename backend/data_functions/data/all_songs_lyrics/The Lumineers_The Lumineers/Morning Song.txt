Morning Song Lyrics
The carbonation in my drink
The bubbles rise, while my heart sinks
And all I tend to do is think of you
Was it easier to pack your bags
And book that flight to Paris
As the plane began to move that afternoon?

And when all the trains have pulled away
From local stations in decay
It’s I who waits, it’s you who’s late again
And did you think of me when you made love to him?
Was it the same as us, or was it different?
It must have been

And all the pretty dames, they’ll hug and kiss you all the same
And when they go, they’re gone, they’re not running late
Oh, all— All the pretty dames
And the kids that you hold in your arms
With promises to protect them from harm
But they grow, and they go, and you’re all alone
All the kids, all the kids that you hold

And it’s a shame that it ends this way, with nothing left to say
So just sit on your hands, while I walk away
It’s a shame, it’s a shame, it’s a shame
When my hands begin to shake
When bitterness is all I taste
And my car won’t stop, cause I cut the brakes
I hold on to a hope in my fate
Oh-oh, ah-ah, hey-hey
May you return to love one day
Well, I hope and I pray, you get what you gave
Oh-oh, ah-ah, hey-hey5Embed
