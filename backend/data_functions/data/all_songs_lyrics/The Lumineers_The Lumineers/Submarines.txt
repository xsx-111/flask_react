Submarines Lyrics
I believe submarines underneath deep blue sea
Saw the flags, Japanese
No one will believe me
Ran back to the town bar
And I told the people how I had seen a submarine
And everyone laughed aloud

I did spy a periscope
Dead of night on the eastern coast
The police made them jokes, told me I’d seen a ghost
Everyone thinks I’m a liar, no one knows the truth
If it was a bigger fire, I would be on the roof

Ships will rust in Baldwin Bay (Let me go)
No one trusts what I say (I don’t know)
Oh my god, no one paid (attention)
Overnight, my hair turned gray (Oh, oh, oh)
In the end, it boils down to credibility
I had none, so I will die with the secrets of the sea

(Submarine)
(Can't find me)
Submarine
