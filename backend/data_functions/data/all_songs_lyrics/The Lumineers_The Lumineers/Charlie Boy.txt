Charlie Boy Lyrics
Charlie boy, don’t go to war
First born in forty four
Kennedy made him believe we could do much more

Lillian, don’t hang your head, love should make you feel good
In uniform, you raised a man, who volunteered to stand

Play the bugle, play the taps
Make your mothers proud
Raise your rifles to the sky, boys
Fire that volley loud

News was bad on Upland Ave, Metuchen mourn our loss
Sons rebelled, while fathers yelled and mothers clutched the cross

Play the bugle, play the taps
Make your fathers proud
Raise your rifles to the sky, boys
Fire that volley loud14Embed
