Flapper Girl Lyrics
Cut off all of your hair
Did you flinch, did you care
Did he look, did he stop and stare
At your brand new hair
Local boy, local news
Power lines hangin boots
Firemen in their trucks cut loose
A local boy’s shoes
Cadillac, cadillac
Businessmen dressed in slacks
I’m gonna buy one for us when i get back
A big cadillac

And you can wave to all of your friends
And I’ll never leave you again

Would you write would you call back baby if
I wrote you a song
I been gone but you’re still my lady and
I need you at home

Romeo, Juliet
Balcony in silhouette
Makin Os with her cigarette
It’s Juliet
Flapper girl, flapper girl
Prohibition in curls
Hair of gold and a neck of pearls
It’s flapper girl
And you can wave to all of your friends
And I’ll never leave you again

Would you write would you call back baby if
I wrote you a song
I been gone but you’re still my lady and
I need you at home

Cause if you ain’t behind my door
Then I ain’t got a home anymore

Would you write would you call back baby if
I wrote you a song
I been gone but you’re still my lady and
I need you at home

Lovers come, lovers go
Lovers leave me alone
She’ll come back to me10Embed
