Classy Girls Lyrics
Well, she was standing in a bar
I said, "Hello, how do you do?"
She handed me a beer with a kangaroo
She spoke of places I had never been; that she had traveled to
And we slow danced alone to faster tunes
I made her laugh, I made a pass
I showed her my half-dollar ring
She said, "That’s pretty cool,"
But classy girls don’t kiss in bars, you fool
(No, they don't!)

So, later on, the crowd calmed down
And I believe it was as if smething drew me closer to her lips
So, picture my surprise when I had tried to lean in for a kiss
And she just smiled and turned her head down quick
I asked her why, and she replied
It was nothing I was doing wrong, it’s just what it is
But classy girls, don’t kiss in bars like this

No, classy girls don’t kiss in bars
Boys will break their backs and hearts
But it’s all right, the hardest part is through
Oh, through
Oh, through
Oh, through
The hardest part is through3Embed
