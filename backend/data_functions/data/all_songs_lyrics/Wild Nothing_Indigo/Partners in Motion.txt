Partners in Motion Lyrics
I caught you in the dollhouse
Drinking coffee with your new wife
How is your new life?
Swiping through headlines
How do you find the time?
You two look very nice (very nice)

Silver in your eyes
The synapse connecting
Red and open wide
Homelife in the wild

You're looking very nice
You're looking very nice

Now I'm obsessive
Walking through keyholes
Fixing picture frames
Letting the soil drain
I had a temper but now I'm delicate
I keep it to myself
I keep it to myself
Silver in your eyes
The synapse connecting
Red and open wide
Homelife in the wild


Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
(Take over dream nights to find love)
Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
( you don't have to go)
Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
(Take on my dream )
Partners in motion, beautiful devotionEmbed
