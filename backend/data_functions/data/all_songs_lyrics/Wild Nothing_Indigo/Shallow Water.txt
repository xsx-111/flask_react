Shallow Water Lyrics
When I'm home
There is nothing I'm looking for
That you haven't already found
When I'm home
In the shallow water
You can swim around me
I won't mind

Circling me underneath
The only one I'll ever need
Eyes are moving in your sleep
And I wish I knew what you were watching

When everything goes quiet for a while
There's nothing left for us to reconcile
When everything goes quiet for a while
I'll meet you in the shallow water

I'm a fool
But at least you're foolish too
You're my crutch
But it's you that helps me to walk
Drowning in a coral sea
The only place I'll ever be
Eyes are moving in your sleep
And I wish I knew what you were watching

When everything goes quiet for a while
There's nothing left for us to reconcile
When everything goes quiet for a while
I'll meet you in the shallow water1Embed
