Flawed Translation LyricsUp to my old ways
Doubting good intentions
I would promise you wonder
If I could only find it
Ooh, yeah
Let's stay together, baby
Let's stay together, yeah
Let's stay together, baby
Let's stay together
Visiting time again
(Come together, come together)
Dreamhouse arresting
(Come together, come together)
I'm all thumbs for you
(Come together, come together)
In a flawed translation
(Come together, come together)
Put my teeth to rest
Charming the snake
A flood of flowers
A field of vision corrected
I should have felt you changing
Let's stay together, baby
Let's stay together, yeah
Let's stay together, baby
Let's stay together, yeah
(Come together, come together)
Let's stay together, baby
Let's stay together
(Come together, come together)
Let's stay together, baby
Let's stay togetherEmbed
