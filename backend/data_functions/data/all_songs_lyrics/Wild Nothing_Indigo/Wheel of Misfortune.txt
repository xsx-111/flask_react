Wheel of Misfortune Lyrics
What awaits behind that door
Some new brand of heartache 2.0?
Rave reviews, the world gone mad
Starring self-doubt as your right-hand man
Blown a kiss or blown a bubble
Chewing gum stuck to Verona

Everyone takes
Their turn at the wheel
Of misfortune
Everyone knows
That love is worth the questions
Never answered

Look at us, all fools in traffic
Simple creatures of habit
Admiration left too long
A bad taste for such a sweet song
Hit or miss is here to stay
Or you'll watch her fade away
Or you watch her fade away

Everyone takes
Their turn at the wheel
Of misfortune
Everyone knows
That love is worth the questions
Never answered

(Everyone, every)
Everyone takes
(Their turn at the wheel)
Their turn at the wheel
Of misfortune
(Everyone, everyone)
Everyone knows
(That love is worth the questions)
That love is worth the questions
Never answeredEmbed
