Canyon on Fire Lyrics
Bars are all closed
But I can't stand the thought of going home
Cheap red wine, fireworks over the freeway
Stretching the sky
When it rains in L.A. you all most forget
How it smells when the whole city is burning

Let's drive around
I want to see how other people live
Needless palaces kissing the hillside
Take your pick
Every dream exactly like the last
You and I in a canyon on fire

Who would I be without you?
Who would I be without you?
Who would I be without you?
(Someone I don't know)
Who would I be without you?
See right through me
See right through me

See right through me
Who would I be without you?
Who would I be without you?
See right through meEmbed
