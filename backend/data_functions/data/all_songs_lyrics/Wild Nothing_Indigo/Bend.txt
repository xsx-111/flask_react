Bend Lyrics
It's a sound I know so well
A thousand voices bleeding into one
Listening to lovers talk
I only dream of ordinary things

The moon is low tonight
(Any time of night)
And I bend to keep myself in line
(Any time of night)

Half-awake, I see her face
An angel swinging from a trapeze wire
Sad and lost with curly hair
And chicken feathers strapped against her back

The moon is low tonight
(Any time of night)
And I bend to keep myself in line
(Any time of night)
It's all I want
(Any time of night)
This strange desire come to life
(Any time of night)
(Any time of night)
(Any time of night)

The moon is low tonight
(Any time of night)
And I bend to keep myself in line
(Any time of night)
It's all I want
(Any time of night)
A strange desire come to life
(Any time of night)Embed
