Letting Go Lyrics
It's getting hard for me
To reframe all those shifting memories
Like a music box that
Never starts dancing by itself
What a broken world, what a broken world
But it's my own
Just to see you, to see through you
I step inside

Letting go, I want to be happier now
I want to be more than close
Surreal, the way you made me out
The way you crash me down

It's getting hard for me
To remember all of the names from my life
You've been so many
Different kinds of people in my mind

Letting go, I want to be happier now
I want to be more than close
Surreal, the way you made me out
Letting go, I want to be happier now
I want to be more than close
Surreal, the way you made me out
The way you crash me down

Letting go, I want to be happier now
I want to be more than close
Surreal, the way you made me out
Letting go, I want to be happier now
I want to be more than close
Surreal, the way you made me outEmbed
