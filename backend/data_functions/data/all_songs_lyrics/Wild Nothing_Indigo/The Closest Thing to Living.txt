The Closest Thing to Living LyricsRunning in place
A joke for the age of detachment
This is how we unwind
This is how we unwind
Together but alone
When I look at you
It's a screen turned blue
Now my eyes never rest
Now my eyes never rest
Breathe indigo
It's the closest thing to living
I sometimes feel unlike myself
The time may come
We live once and we die once
(The time may come)
A cold mind comes rushing in
The time may come
(The time may come)
The time may come
(The time may come)
(It's the closest thing to living)
The time may come
(The time may come)
(It's the closest thing to living)
The time may comeEmbed
