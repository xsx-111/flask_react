Oscillation Lyrics
My little clover
Are we past the chase?
Our future taking shape
Scratching the surface
Selective memory
It's the ritual we keep

Oscillation
Pulling me close
Pushing me back
Oscillation
Pulling me close
Pushing me back

Reflections aging
Our morning vanity
Waking up right next to me
This way, that way
Always rushing ahead
This way, that way
Always rushing ahead

Oscillation
Pulling me close
Pushing me back
Oscillation
Pulling me close
Pushing me back
This way, that way
Always rushing ahead
This way, that way
(Waking up right next to me)
Always rushing ahead
This way, that way
(Waking up right next to me)
Always rushing ahead
This way, that way
(Waking up right next to me)
Always rushing ahead

Oscillation
Pulling me close
Pushing me back
Oscillation
Pulling me close
Pushing me backEmbed
