Listen to My Voice Lyrics
Listen to my voice
And please try to understand
The one you call Messiah is a lie
You are not the plan
And your beginning to annoy
You are just a game and it has won
You will never see
The places promised by your faith
You will never know eternal peace
The God you love is gone
He lies broken by your shame
The thing that took his place already died

It will send angels
Send black angels for you
It will send angels
Send black angels for you
It will send angels
Send black angels for you

I am just a voice
That no-one else will hear
Only you are pure enough for truth
You must write 'The Book'
And then tear away belief
Only you can save the light of man
It will send angels
Send black angels for you
It will send angels
Send black angels for you
It will send angels
Send black angels for youEmbed
