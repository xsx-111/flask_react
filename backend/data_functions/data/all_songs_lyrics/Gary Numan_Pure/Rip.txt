Rip Lyrics
I'll get down on my knees
I'll do anything I can
I'll even walk upon water
I'll give somebody disease
I'm so sick with need
I'm so sick with pain
I'll lay before the cross and pray
I'll bleed like holy rain

Hey, hey, hey
I've got nothing to do
Hey, hey, hey
I've done nothing to you
Hey, hey, hey
I've got nothing to do
Hey, hey, hey
I've done nothing to you

I'll rip the skin from God's face
I'll say I'm searching for the truth
I stole the light from heaven's gates
If it can guide me to you
I'll give life to obsession
I'll give life to disease
I'll give you one last sin or cure
And then I'll do as I please
Hey, hey, hey
I've got something for you
Hey, hey, hey
I've got something for you
I've got something for you
I've got something for youEmbed
