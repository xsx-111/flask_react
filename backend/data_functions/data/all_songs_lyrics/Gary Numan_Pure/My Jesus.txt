My Jesus Lyrics
My Jesus is like a voice in the dark
My Jesus is like a lonely warning
My Jesus is like a fear that haunts me
My Jesus is like a tortured memory

I'm praying for my soul
I'm praying for my soul
For my

My Jesus is a collector of pain
My Jesus says: "Pain will prove you love me"
My Jesus is like a shadow crawling
My Jesus says: "Their screams will guide you to me"

Feels so warm inside of you
Feels so warm
Feels so warm inside of you
Feels so warm

I'm praying for your soul
I'm praying for your soul
I'm praying for your soul
I'm praying for your soulEmbed
