Torn Lyrics
Silently I wait alone for you
I've got to put my fear back in its box
Silently I feel you breathe on me
And I hear mercy sigh and leave the room

You could hurt me
Take my breath away
Would you like that?
You could rip me
Leave me torn and cold
Would you like that?

One more sin
Make me unforgiven
One more sin
Make me unforgiven
One more sin
Make me unforgiven
One more sin
Make me unforgiven

Silently I turn and play begins
I watch you smile just like a dead thing smiles
Silently I lose and darkness comes
I hear you laugh as God abandons me
You could cut me
Let me die for you
Would you like that?
Would you like that?

All I feel
Makes me unforgiven
All I feel
Makes me unforgiven
All I feel
Makes me unforgiven
All I feel
Makes me unforgivenEmbed
