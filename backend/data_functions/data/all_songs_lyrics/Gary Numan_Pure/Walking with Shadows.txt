Walking with Shadows Lyrics
All my life they've been here
Waiting for you patiently

All they want is your heart and soul
They want your tears to fall
All they want is your purest sin
They want to welcome you in

They will seem innocent
But they will lead you back to me

All they need is one tortured soul
They need walking shadows
All they need is your last confession
They need your pain to show me

I'm waiting for the unforgiven
Waiting for sleep to come
I waiting for my one obsession
Waiting for you to come home
Innocence is pain in disguse
They said, now I believeEmbed
