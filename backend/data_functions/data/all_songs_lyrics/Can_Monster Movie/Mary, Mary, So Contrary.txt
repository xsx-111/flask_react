Mary, Mary, So Contrary LyricsMary, oh Mary, so quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
These silver bells and cockle shells
And pretty men all in a row
Went to see contrary Mary
Told her I refuse to tarry
We spoke very soft and slow
Without your pretty men, Mary, standin' in a row
Mary, Mary - Mary, Mary
Smoked a haiku cigarette
Turned around and then we left
Smiling as the way began to grow
We got your pretty men all in a row
Mary, Mary, so quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
These silver bells and cockle shells
And pretty men all in a row
Mary, Mary - Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary - Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary - Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary - Mary, Mary
Went to see contrary Mary
Told her I refuse to tarry
We spoke very soft and slow
We got your pretty men standin' in a row
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary1Embed
