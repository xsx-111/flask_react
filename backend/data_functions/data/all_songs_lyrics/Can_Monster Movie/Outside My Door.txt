Outside My Door LyricsMany things are you afraid of, you say nothing
Take many things serious, I ask
"Can you hear the train whistle outside the door
I can hear the train whistle outside my door."
Any colour is bad
Any colour is bad
Any colour is bad
That's what you say
When will we be home, be at home, a line, no questions
Now I don't know what I feel, "be easy", Jaki said that
I just saw her, could say another colour, I don't know if that's good or bad
"For five colours will make the ears blind", Jaki said that
Actually here's the sound, I hear that
Can you hear the train whistle outside the door
I could dance to your front times in defence, maybe sometimes more
Now and then, as I read before, they're dying on the dancefloor
Can you hear the train whistle outside my door
Why don't you dance us some more
Why don't you dance us some more
Why don't you dance us some more
Like before
Why don't you dance us some more
Why don't you dance us some more
Why don't you dance us some more
Like before
Many things are you afraid of, you say nothing
Take many things serious, I said "yes" with a smile
Can you hear the train whistle outside my door, yeah
Can you hear the train whistle outside my door, yeah
Can you hear the train whistle outside my door
Outside my door, outside my door
Outside my door, outside my door
Outside my door, outside my door
Outside my door, outside my door2Embed
