Falling in Love (Uh-Oh) Lyrics
Two of hearts
Lace and satin
Something in the air
Feel like another crook
That's been captured by your stare

Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling in love
Falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh
And I don't wanna, no, no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling in love
Falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling, falling

Jealous feelings
Reappearing
Such a wicked dare
I'm just so damned confused
And I wonder
Do you care?
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling in love
Falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh
And I don't wanna, no, no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling in love
Falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling, falling

Like walking in the park
Or dancing in the dark
Just wanna hold you through out the night
Prince of fire
Sweet desire
With devil may you care
Release me from your spell
I don't want this
Love ain't fair
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling in love
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling, falling
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling in love, falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling in love, falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling in love, falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh, and I don't want to no, no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling in love, falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling, fallingEmbed
