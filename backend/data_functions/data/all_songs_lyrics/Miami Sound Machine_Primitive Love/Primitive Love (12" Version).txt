Primitive Love (12" Version) LyricsNo one in love
It's all a hassle
What's done is done
Now it's my turn to have some fun
You're much too sly
Don't give me alibis
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
CHORUS
Primitive love; I want what it used to be
I want it; Primitive love
Primitive love; I want what it used to be
I want what it used to be; Primitive love
I want, I need
Primitive Love
Don't have to worry
I don't want your money
I don't have to think
Right now you've got me at the brink
This is goodbye
For all the times I cried
Don't want no more
Don't want no more
REPEAT CHORUS
Is it right, or is it wrong
Primitive drums
Call me backward into stone
Pack up and leave
I'm not yours to deceive
Don't want you no more
Don't want you no more
REPEAT CHORUSEmbed
