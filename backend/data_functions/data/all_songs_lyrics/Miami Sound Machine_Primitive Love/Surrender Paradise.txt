Surrender Paradise Lyrics
Tropical breeze
Caressing me
Sweet fragrant air enticing me
Starlet skies are offering their love to me
I surrender to you, paradise

Heaven and earth are becoming as one
Shining light on their world
Open your heart
Spread your wings
Take a chance
For the flight of your life

Warm summer night
Twinkling of stars
Gardenia blooms
Oh, whispering love
Moonlight playing up and down
A drifting waterfall
I surrender to you, paradise

Crystal blue sea
The white sandy beach
Sunset commands a rainbow to raise
All the birds in wonderland
Are singing perfect harmony
I surrender to you, paradise


Secrets of love
Lurking beyond
Rapture me now
I know your passion is mine
Suncast waves are frolicing
Along the foamy shore
I surrender to you, paradise
Butterflies are flattering the top of strings
I surrender to you, paradise
Moonlight playing up and down
A drifting waterfall
I surrender to you, paradise
I surrender my love
When you want me, you need me
I will be here
Giving my love to you, paradiseEmbed
