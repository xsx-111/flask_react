Bad Boy (12" Version) LyricsBad boy bad boy
Boys will be boys
Always get so restless
Nothing but trouble
Leaving me feeling breathless
Nothing but trouble
Bad bad bad bad boy
You make me feel so good
You naughty bad bad bad bad boy
You make me feel so good
Knew you would
The way you hold me tight
You get me so excited
You do me oh so right
My heart goes beat beat
Beat beat beat beat
Bad bad bad bad boy
You make me feel so good
You naughty bad bad bad bad boy
You make me feel so good
Knew you would
Boys will be boys
Bad boy bad boy
Always get so restless
Nothing but trouble
Leaving me feeling breathless
Nothing but trouble
And when he drives me home
I feel so safe at night
He'll call me on the phone
It goes ring ring ring
Ring-a-ring ring
Boys will be boys
Bad boy bad boy
Boys will be boys
Bad boy bad boy
Always get so restless
Nothing but trouble
Leaving me feeling breathless
Nothing but troubleEmbed
