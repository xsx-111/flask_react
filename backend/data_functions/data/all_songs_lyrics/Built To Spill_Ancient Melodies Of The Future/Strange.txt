Strange Lyrics
This strange plan is random at best
This strange, how much more can I take?
This strange change in atmosphere
And in gravity too, and its severity
This strange day is almost over
Just started to get sick of it

And it's strange, but nothing's all that strange
Yeah, it's strange, but what's so strange about that?
Yeah, it's strange, but what isn't strange?
Yeah, it's strange, but oh well

This strange plan is random at best
This strange, how much more can I take?
This strange sound you said I said
You're not listening, or I'm not saying it right
This strange war of promises
Let's call us a truce and call it the truth

And it's strange, but nothing's all that strange
Yeah, it's strange, but what's so strange about that?
Yeah, it's strange, but what isn't strange?
Yeah, it's strange, but oh wellEmbed
