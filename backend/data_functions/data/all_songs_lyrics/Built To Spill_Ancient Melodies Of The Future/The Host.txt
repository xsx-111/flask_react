The Host Lyrics
They never feel
They don't even seem real
They never try
So why should I?
Something is wrong
Something invisible is gone
They never mind
So why should I?

Don't you get hurt?
Don't you ever need a cure?
Don't you get tired?
And why and why?
After awhile
After neither one arrives
They won't decide
So why should I?

When they hand it over, give it all away
Well, how can you explain?
When they hand it over, no one gets their way
No one gets the blame
Don't you get tired
Of everyone that you admire?
They'll never die
So why should I?
Something is wrong
Something invisible is gone
They never mind
So why should I?

When they hand it over, give it all away
Well, how can you explain?
When they hand it over, no one gets their way
No one gets the blameEmbed
