Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss Lyrics
I know you're making
Accidents and stars for everyone
You're amazing
Half of them won't know until you're gone
And in this ritual
You take command and lose control
And in this situation
Find an ocean, sell your soul

Fly around my pretty little miss
Why don't you
Fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you
Fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you
Fly around my pretty little miss?

And when it's over
Set aside a moment to forget
It's now or never
Now's the chance to choose what you'll regret
To taking all your time
And leaving me with more than I want
Because I know this time
Absolutely, positively
Maybe, maybe
Maybe, maybe
Maybe, maybe
Maybe

Fly around my pretty little miss
Why don't you
Fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you
Fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you
Fly around my pretty little miss?

And all the signs of your life
You're making all time alright
And all the lines of your life
You make it fine
And when it's later
Open up your window just in case
You're a radar
Built to scan the deeps of outer space
And if you recognize
Subtle patterns in the sky
Don't take it as a sign
Unless it eases your mind
Fly around my pretty little miss
Why don't you
Fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you
Fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you
Fly around my pretty little miss?Embed
