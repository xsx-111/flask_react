Happiness Lyrics
Haven't had half a hand
In half of what I am
Haven't heard of half the things
That happened in the past
Haven't given half the time to half the people
Half the things I've planned
You don't have to be so cruel
'Cause all I do is a little less than what I can

Happiness will only
Happen when it can
Happiness will only
Happen when it can

Haven't had the half of mind it takes
To start to take a stand
Haven't held on half as long as I had hoped
As I had hoped to plan
Haven't missed half the shit they said I had
To have to have a chance
You don't have to be so cruel
'Cause all I do is a little less than what I can
Happiness will only
Happen when it can
Happiness will only
Happen when it can
And happiness will only
Happen when it can
Happiness will only
Happen when it canEmbed
