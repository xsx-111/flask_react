Trimmed and Burning LyricsTake it on and take it over
Take in as much as you can see
I can almost think about it, but
I can't arrange for you to see
Didn't know what I'm afraid of
I had to learn it from a dream
There's a light that never goes out
Burning a hole inside of me
Keep your lamps all trimmed and burning
Might be alarmed with what you see
I've agreed to always love you
But never enough to set you free1Embed
