Alarmed Lyrics
In the hurry of the past
I forgot to make it last
Simple choices made too fast
By a die I didn't cast

I'm alarmed and I can't recover from
Crashing onto this island we've become

Words for fighting, words for fun
They've all melted into one
On the tip of every tongue
Like a new name for the sun

I'm alarmed and I can't recover from
Crashing onto this island we've become

Alright now, don't decide about that now
Oh, how can you blame the only one?
Ever stay, ever stay, ever stayed around, and you would
Never say, never say all the harm's been done, and you were
Also gone, oh so long, so long
Did you make it all wrong, so wrong?
Did you wait oh so long, so long?
Did you take it all wrong, so wrong?
