The Weather Lyrics
Do you want in to the outside in the cool night
Where the stars gravitate toward you?
Do you want in to the outside in the cool night
Where the fog wraps itself around you?
Do you want in to the outside in the sunshine
Where the clouds take their places for you?

And the wind and snow and the rain that blows
None of those would matter much without you

And as long as it's talking with you
Talk of the weather will do

Do you want in to the outside in the cool night
Where the stars gravitate toward you?
Do you want in to the outside in the sunshine
Where the song repeats itself inside you?
And the wind and snow and the rain that blows
None of those would matter much without you

Nobody's hoping for better days
No one knows what to do
You're okay in your secret place
No one bothering you
It might save time if I meet you there
But I don't care, I'd rather wait for you
No one's home and the weather's fine
Rather wait for you
Where no one's home and the weather's fine
Rather wait for you2Embed
