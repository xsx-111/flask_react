Magical Spell LyricsDon't she look good
Don't she look fine
She needs to be picked
Like fruit off the vine
Ain't she got class
Ain't she got style
She's got the right ass
But all the while
Ain't I a wreck
Hey my, can't you tell
I fell into her magical spell
Don't she look good
Don't she look fine
She needs to be picked
Like fruit off the vine
Ain't she got class
Ain't she got style
She's got the right ass
But all the while
Ain't I a wreck
Hey my, can't you tell
I fell into her magical spell
And it felt like this
Been movin' round
Like two ships in the night
In the same town
But somethin' ain't right
Am I too nice
Or am I too mean
Does she even think twice
It needs to be seen
Ain't I a wreck
Hey my, can't you tell
I fell into her magical spell
Yeah
Don't she look good
And don't she look fine
She needs to be picked
Like fruit off the vine
Ain't she got class
Ain't she got style
She's got the right ass
But all the while
Ain't I a wreck
Hey my, can't you tell
I fell into her magical spell
Ain't I a wreck
Hey my, can't you tell
I fell into her magical spell
Yes I did, yeahEmbed
