The Eyes of Texas LyricsThe eyes of Texas... are upon you
The eyes of Texas... are upon you
The eyes of Texas... are upon you
Now here come the girl
In that pretty red Ford
Yeah they're packing them girl
In that pretty red ford
And out of the engine
Came the flame with a name
And it burned up your mind
Baby make you insane
The eyes of Texas... are upon you
The voice of Texas... stands beside you
The eyes of Texas... are upon you
Yeah I put on my boots
And I got down to work
Yeah I sang her a song
And I got down to work
And out of the engine
Came the flame with a name
It burned up my mind
And it made me insane
The eyes of Texas... are upon you
The eyes of Texas... are upon you
The eyes of Texas... are upon you
Now get me a bottle
Get me a smoke
Yeah, I gotta kick back
Gotta let it all go
In the middle of nowhere
Is where I wanna be
In the shade of pines
Is where I wanna be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The eyes of Texas... are upon you
The eyes of Texas... are upon you
The eyes of Texas... are upon youEmbed
