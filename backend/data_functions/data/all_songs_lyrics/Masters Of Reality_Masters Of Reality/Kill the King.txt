Kill the King LyricsI was askin' for two dollars
Two shots to kill the King
"If you really love me and you're thinking of me
You'd do just about anything"
It happened on a sunday
And the liqour stores were closed
Thank heaven for the blue laws
We were swimmin' in our sunday clothes
I was askin' for two dollars
To cook up somethin' cheap
I was shakin' like the rabbit
That was hangin' from her teeth
"And in many degrees of heat
The fire looked at the meat
And if I cook you the least you can do
Is lay there and be sweet"
Call the fire in winter
When it snows and it won't be cold
Call the wind in summer
If the salt should reign as gold
Eraticus
Kill the King
Magentus
Kill the King
Its and bits and sitting wrong
Heaven is one to come home
Spend another minute here
Oh, make me spend another year
Call the fire in winter
When it snows and it won't be cold
Call the wind in summer
If the salt should reign as gold
Eraticus
Kill the King
Magentus
Kill the KingEmbed
