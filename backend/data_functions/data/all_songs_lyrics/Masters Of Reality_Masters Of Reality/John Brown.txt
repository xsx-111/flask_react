John Brown LyricsJohn Brown bring him down
Pull his body to the ground
Left him up for long enough
Let me be the baby gruff
John Brown bring him down
Pull his body to the ground
John Brown bring him down
Pull his body to the ground
Left him up for long enough
Let me be the baby gruff
The goat he ran, the goat he hid
Left to Billy, walk the bridge
John Brown bring him down
Pull his body to the ground
Holiday, holiday
I declare a holiday
Holiday, holiday
No matter what the doctors say
Holiday, holiday
We pull John down at noon today
Tomorrow day, nothing rings
Nothing brings and nothing rings
Aaaah...aaaah
Holiday, holiday
I declare a holiday
Holiday, holiday
No matter what the doctors say
Holiday, holiday
We pull John down at noon today
Holiday, holiday
We pull him down at noon today
Holiday, holiday
Holiday, holiday
Holiday, holiday
Holiday, holiday
Aaaah...aaaah
