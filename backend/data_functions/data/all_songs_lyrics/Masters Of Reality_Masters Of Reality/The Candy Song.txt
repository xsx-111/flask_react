The Candy Song LyricsLay it down little honey child
Got something I wanna taste
I got myself a hatchet
To lay these woods to waste
And when my work is through
I'll bring my cash to you
Go down and see my sugar girl
She knows just what to do
Sugar girl wanna piece of that stuff
Crawlin' outta my skin and I'm down on my luck
Sugar girl knocks me off of my feet
Yeah the price is high but the candy's sweet
Been workin' so hard baby
Workin' all night and day
Sometimes I feel like gettin' blind
And jumping in the bay
If you feel like I do too
You know what you gotta do
Go down and see the sugar girl
And she'll take care of you
Sugar girl wanna piece of that stuff
Crawlin' outta my skin and I'm down on my luck
Sugar girl knocks me off of my feet
Yeah the price is high but the candy's sweet
Sugar girl wanna piece of that stuff
Crawlin' outta my skin and I'm down on my luck
Sugar girl knocks me off of my feet
Yeah the price is high but the candy's sweet
Sugar girl wanna piece of that stuff
Crawlin' outta my skin and I'm down on my luck
Sugar girl knocks me off of my feet
Yeah the price is high but the candy's sweet
Sugar girl wanna piece of that stuff
Crawlin' outta my skin and I'm down on my luck
Sugar girl knocks me off of my feet
Yeah the price is high but the candy's sweet
Sugar girl wanna piece of that stuff
Crawlin' outta my skin and I'm down on my luck
Sugar girl knocks me off of my feet
Yeah the price is high but the candy's sweet
Sugar girl wanna piece of that stuff
Crawlin' outta my skin and I'm down on my luck
Sugar girl knocks me off of my feet
Yeah the price is high but the candy's sweetEmbed
