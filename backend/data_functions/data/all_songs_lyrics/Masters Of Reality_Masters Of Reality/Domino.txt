Domino LyricsWalking down the street I can feel the tension
Everybody on me like I'm some kinda suspect
It's gotten me to thinkin' life's some kinda survival
Hell, that'll be the day when love is my rival
Get me on a plane to the Himalayas
I'll find a little ruby to waste my time with and...
Paint me a picture
And make it the devil
We'll run down the hole if
The roof ain't level
Domino
Domino
Well, I'm shit outta luck today man
Now I'm callin' in my favors
Seems that I can't chew on whipped cream
Without me wakin' up some neighbor who'll...
Paint me a picture
And make it the devil
We'll run down the hole if
The roof ain't level
Domino's fallin'
Black spiders spinnin'
The white gloves flashin'
And I ain't winnin'
Domino
Domino
Paint me a picture
And make it the devil
We'll run down the hole if
The roof ain't level
Domino's fallin'
Black spiders spinnin'
The white gloves flashin'
And I ain't winnin'
Domino
Domino
