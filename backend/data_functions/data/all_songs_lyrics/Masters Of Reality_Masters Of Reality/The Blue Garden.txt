The Blue Garden LyricsThen when the circle spoke
The light fell
The spell broke
Come down on me
Lightning
Came downward
And I fell
As a tear
It's been a sad life
As I stood holding the light to the dark
The eyes that seek me
The eyes that hold all the pain of the world
Lightning
Came downward
And I fell
As a tear
It's been a sad life
As I stood holding the light to the dark
The eyes that seek me
The eyes that hold all the pain of the world
Wo-o-o-rld
Aahaa-aa-aa
Aahaa-aa-aa
Aahaa
Then when the circle spoke
The light fell
The spell broke
Come down on me
I saw a strange sight
An angel smiled in the red morning light
Wo-o-o-rld
Aahaa-aa-aa
Aahaa-aa-aa
Aahaa-aa-aa
Aahaa-aa-aa
Aahaa-aa-aa
Aahaa-aa-aa
Aahaa-aa-aaEmbed
