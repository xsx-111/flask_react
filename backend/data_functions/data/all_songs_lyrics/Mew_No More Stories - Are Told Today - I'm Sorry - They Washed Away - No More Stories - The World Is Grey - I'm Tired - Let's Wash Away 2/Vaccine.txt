Vaccine LyricsTwo words a day – it seems a waste
Can we go on it into your place?
(Quick is the passing daylight)
And it’s meant for you what is left of me
Is it on purpose you cannot see?
(What is the reason truly?)
We know you
And it’s true, San Marie
We helped you get to be all rid of now
It’s gone for good
Where vaccine Maria, fit Maria
Slowly searched the arch-less singing words
Don’t worry, there were trips
See easy there were trips
Now I’m lost
You now have to find me
When you gotta bring it over
The feeling isn’t over
And we can’t create
(Still in your mind’s eye)
And your retina is clouded
We made a joke about it
It was funny – kind of
We lost the plot
We plumb forgot
For all those tasking hours that stopped
(Quick is the passing daylight)
When your day is wrong
And it speaks to you
We know you’re after some kind of truth
(What is the reason truly?)
We know you
And it’s true, San Marie
We helped you get to be
Where vaccine Maria, fit Maria
Slowly searched the arch-less singing words
Don’t worry, there were trips
See easy there were trips, now
Even when she has no wish for arms
When you gotta bring it over
The feeling isn’t over
And we can’t create
(Still in your mind’s eye)
And your retina is clouded
You made a joke about it
It was funny – kind of
(Still in your mind’s eye)
When you gotta bring it over
The feeling isn’t over
And we can’t create
That week you spent in the hospital
I was so scared you’d disappear
Did you know that?
We cope – it’s to pieces now
The diligence of hope
And me – the worst kind of person
A person can be
Some prize!
But through your eyes I’m a wholly different size
Maybe we can make it together?Embed
