Silas the Magic Car LyricsI wanted you to be at home
I wanted you to be at home
Could you foresee a day?
You might not play?
I wanted you to be at home
I wanted you to be at home
Could you foresee a day?
You might not play?
I wanted you to be at home
Silas and Bo, they got tired
And they’ll call you once a week
‘Cause it’s strange here
No dark career
They all say they long
To reach their sorrow now
That’s gone
I wanted you to be at home
I wanted you to be at home
Could you foresee a day?
You might not play?
I wanted you to be at home
I wanted you to be at home
Could you foresee a day?
You might not play?
They took us in to see their new apartment
Thinking we’re slow and that our love is mean
We’ll leave the green green
‘Cause maybe we’ll get out somehow
No-one thought of it
We didn’t know we’d seen their last show
Silas and Bo, they got tired
And they’ll call you once a week
‘Cause it’s strange here
No dark career
They all say they long
To reach their sorrow now
That’s gone
And you – no dark career
They all say they long
To reach their sorrow now
That’s gone
And you – no dark career
They all say they long
To reach their sorrow now
That’s gone
And you – no dark career
They all say they long
To reach their sorrow now
That’s goneEmbed
