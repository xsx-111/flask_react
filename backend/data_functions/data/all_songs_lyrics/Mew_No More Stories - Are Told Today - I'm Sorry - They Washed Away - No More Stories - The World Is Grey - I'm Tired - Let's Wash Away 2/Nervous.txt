Nervous LyricsNervous, I know
(And I saw you running)
It seems everywhere you go
(In the wooden floors of my house)
They're out to get you
(In a way I couldn't see you)
And then you regret
(And they're not safe buildings)
Should have stayed at home in bed
(When the walls are out of focus)
Nervous instead
(And I wish that I could save you)
Each time
(1:56)
And you're so glad
No one can see
Inside of your tireless mindEmbed
