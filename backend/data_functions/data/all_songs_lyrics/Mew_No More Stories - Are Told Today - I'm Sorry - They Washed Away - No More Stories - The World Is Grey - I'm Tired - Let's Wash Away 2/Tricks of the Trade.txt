Tricks of the Trade LyricsWhat they gonna do to me?
Just when I thought Iâ€™d be
Done with all the memories
She's calling me
Trouble in her family
What they gonna do to me?
Just when I thought I'd be
Letting go of every hope clawing me
Trouble in her family
Hey! Too dark to see
Take a chance and shimmer
No! Why does it have to be?
It's always you and me
This in which we couldn't see
This in which we tried so hard finding
How our creased hearts binding
Pushes you again to never see your friends
To rip apart the lights of those
Whose love deprives you
And it's this in which we couldn't seeEmbed
