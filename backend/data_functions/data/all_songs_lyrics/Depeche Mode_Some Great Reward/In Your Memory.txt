In Your Memory Lyrics
Put up the barriers, shut down your senses
Cover up with all of your pretences
See no evil, your eyes are blunted
We are the hunters, we are the hunted

Place it in your memory
Leave it in your past
But don't forget

Taking a tumble, I'm taking a drop
Sometimes I stumble when my mind's made up
Reaction levels seem strangely muted
Ordinary acts of fun have been diluted

Place it in your memory
Leave it in your past
But don't forget

Place it in your memory
Place it in your memory
Place it in your memory
Place it in your memory
Place it in your memory5Embed
