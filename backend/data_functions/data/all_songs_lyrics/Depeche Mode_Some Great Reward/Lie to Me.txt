Lie to Me Lyrics
Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one
Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one

Experiences have a lasting impression
But words once spoken don't mean a lot now
Belief is the way, the way of the innocent
And when I say innocent, I should say naive

So lie to me, but do it with sincerity
Make me listen, just for a minute
Make me think there's some truth in it

Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one
Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one
Promises made for convenience
Aren't necessarily what we need
Truth is a word that's lost its meaning
The truth has become merely half-truth

So lie to me, like they do it in the factory
Make me think that at the end of the day
Some great reward will be coming my way

Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one
Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one
Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one
Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one2Embed
