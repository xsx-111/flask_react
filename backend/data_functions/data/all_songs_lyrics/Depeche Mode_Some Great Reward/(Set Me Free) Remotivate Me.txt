(Set Me Free) Remotivate Me Lyrics
Set me free
Set me free

Remotivate me, set me burning
After years in deep freeze, my body is yearning
For a new lease on life
Add a little spice

Set me free, remotivate me
Remotivate me

Give me a reason to scream and shout
Give me something to get excited about
When everything is looking dull
I'm sure it isn't impossible to

Set me free, remotivate me

Remotivate me, set me burning
After years in deep freeze, my body is yearning
For a new lease on life
Add a little spice
Set me free, remotivate me
Remotivate me

Set me free
Set me free
(Remotivate me)
Set me free
Set me free

Don't think I'm impatient
Because I'm willing to wait
But something must happen
Before it gets too late
It could be my imagination
But wasn't there more than this numb sensation?

Set me free, remotivate me
Remotivate me

Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Remotivate me, set me burning
After years in deep freeze, my body is yearning
For a new lease on life
Add a little spice

Set me free, remotivate me
Remotivate me

Set me free
Set me free
(Remotivate me)
Set me free
Set me free
(Remotivate me)
Set me free
Set me free
(Remotivate me)
Set me free
Set me free
(Remotivate me)2Embed
