4 More Lyrics(Never gonna give up on you)
We gonna do it like this
(Just a little bit)
Like that
(Just a little bit)
Zhane
(Just a little bit)
De La
(Just a little bit)
C'mon!
:
I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' for more (don't front, front!) 
:
It's that brown man from Long Island shores
Got a way with women, so I get away with yours
Because you're whole game's outdated
Which leaves all the pretty women heavily sedated
:
Mommy you can play your Ripley's
Or believe it or not
Shoot gift like Heron
With skills of Gil-Scott
Nights like Sir Lancelot can get heated
Prescribing your vibe, love
I know how you need it
: 
:
I like to mingle sometimes
So I head out of state to find a couple of dimes
But at a government rate, can't settle for no nickels
Even pennies for thought, for short
I need connections
With big bank selections
Securing all the sections
With sing-sing corrections
Seedin' like nature, escapin' like gas
Tell me how long this love is gonna last?
Thinkin' fast might spoil somethin'
Turn a whole week to nothin'
Extra to your lady is special
Seen a bigger picture on the screen
But you're a movie, you move me
You soothe me like holidays, getaways
The brochure said do it
So true
It's not a hold hand mission
Cut the public display
Heard you're headed for the stars
Put the gazers away
Nine times out of ten
We cut to good friends
But when we on the tenth
We gotta go the length
:
I'm not a playa yet I get more play
Than a talk show shown across the USA
Have em' moanin' out the vowels sounds
Ooh, eeii, and aahh
And how by now you should know me and my
Crew members do members of the opposite sex
Have their boyfriend screaming out
That we got more techs
Than that ball team in Georgia
(Yo, he said he's comin' for ya!)
All because the ho wanna go to the casbah (Ha!)
: 
:
You can get with
Some of these women
Some of the time
When your face is in the light
Thus stirred with lime
Is it a crime
To sex your mind to death?
Resuscitated
See how many brain cells left
I feel your body's drawn to my positive
Don't even want a baby
If it's that easy to give
I live right around the corner
Three states away
Take a holiday
Come check me
Watch how I set the
Mood, check a movie on the tube
Get your belt mad loose like Lee
Phone's turned way down
To avoid the beef
Or the questions
If she's the only one gettin' lessons
:
You're into crime faces, huh?
Well, I'll play your Capone
Suzy Q got the grill
To make the cake chrome
Situation's gettin' absurd
Hot on a plat
So work the format
See how we do that?
Considering you're figurin'
We'll love on the rock
I'mma keep it up front
To maintain the stock
Displayin' all the goodies
From your knuckle to knees
Make it hot like the Island degrees
Now that's special!
