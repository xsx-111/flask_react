Bill Drummond Said LyricsGive me one good reason why I shouldn't win
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said)
If a falling leaf can't help my suffering
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said)
And I sat around my feet
To teach me how to float
"Get out," she cried in the minute she died
He folded up her coat
And the family cried, "Go spinning 'cross the sky"
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said)
If I sit and pray, my Christmas tree will die
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said)
And if his life gets out of hand
And if his face turns blue
These things are sent to try us
And what more can we do?
And then he walked around my garden
And sniffed around my coat
And then I looked around to see him
His hands around her throat
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said)
If a falling leaf can't help me
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said)
If a falling leaf can't help me
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said)
If a falling leaf can't help me
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said)
If a falling leaf can't help me, I'll be deadEmbed
