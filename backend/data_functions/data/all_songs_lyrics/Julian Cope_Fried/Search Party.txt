Search Party LyricsI came upon you
In bright and shining sun
Oh, tell, it does come over me
Your secret is undone
And soon, I saw you sleeping
And softly in my bed
I gaze my eyes around you
So softly in my bed

Then I hold out my hand
And I brave
For the variant
The cradle is disgusting
It's brittle and it's old
I threw it down the mountainside
A child you must hold
I must care for the both of you
And keep you from the cold
And keep you from eternity
For you cannot be sold
