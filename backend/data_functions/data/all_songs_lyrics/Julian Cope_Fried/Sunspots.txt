Sunspots LyricsSunspots changing glare
Walking ‘round with my very best friend
I got a love song in my head
Strolling ‘round with my very best friend
I look back, but I don’t see
Walking round with my very best friend
She looks good, fine to me
I’m in love with my very best friend

Eeeeeyom, it goes away
And eeeeeyom, it goes away
Sunspots changing gear
Driving ‘round with my very best friend
I got a love song in my head
Holding on to my very best friend
We look back, but I can’t see
Moving on with my very best friend
She looks good, fine to me
I’m in love with my very best friend

Eeeeeyom, it goes away
And eeeeeyom, it goes away
You dig?
And eeeeeyom, it goes away
And eeeeeyom, it goes away
Way, way, way!Embed
