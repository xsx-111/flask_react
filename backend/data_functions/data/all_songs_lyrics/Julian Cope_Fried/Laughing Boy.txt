Laughing Boy LyricsThe wind, it plays upon your hair
A vision of a glorious sea
The wind that follows down from there
Incarcerates the sea
The waking hours are the loneliest ones
For the sinister boys like me
Travelling east, straight lines from the past
I'm happy in morality

Oh no, don't cast me out of here
Oh no, don't cast me out of here
Oh no, don't cast me out, I said "No"
I've got no place to go
The King and Queen of my estates
My real estates are real
The King and Queen have offered me
The estate of Robert Peel
Is it talent you need
Write the talents you see
Write the talent clear for me
And the sign that says
Clean the carpet, maid
Like a carpet, I rolled away

The wind, it plays upon your hair
So ever so gloriously
So be content with the apple spent
On the William Tell of me
As the faces, they bleed
Watch them dull and recede
Won't you help to keep my spirit clear?
Stay a week and a day and never go away
Be forever in my presence, dear
