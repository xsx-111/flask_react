O King of Chaos LyricsThe ground, it shook as Ilai told his tale
The river ever rolls and it can't be beat
The waves all weighed him down like a heavy load
Oh, he went down and he didn't breathe

Oh, king of chaos, won't you love your son?
My mind is disconnected, not the only one
You didn't want any love at all
You try to leave me stranded but I just move on
In my light, in my light
In my light, in my light
When I went down, I was a willing load
They tie me by me hands and  to leave me in the road
Head is in disgrace and he's in a rage
They're looking on the ground and they can't get back
