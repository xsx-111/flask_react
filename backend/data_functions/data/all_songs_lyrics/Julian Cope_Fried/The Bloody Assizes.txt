The Bloody Assizes LyricsTell me your plans, hangman
I built these gallows for you
My mind, so full of rights
I am your judge, your jury, too
You are not martyrs to freedom
Wasting away by the road
Miles and miles of destruction I bring to your cause
Give me your eyes, hangman
You've got no use for them now
Tie me with reason and guilt
Make these cold hands feel warm
Hear but my deeds are a blessing
Run, I can run, I can run
Over the books and the learning I stumble upon
Listen with mouth open wonder
Lose, I can lose, I can lose
These four walls crumble as I cannot live by the rules
So I call up my hounds
Come along for a ride
And if you want to swing in trees
Refuse to live upon your knees
And you will never need to hideEmbed
