Holy Love LyricsMy infatuation
With the first minute of my life
When I defied description and my mind was brutalized
I shake, shake, shake with too much joy
And too much reverie
Who's that rolling in the hay
The baby Jesus or the cavalry?

No, it's me and my adrenaline
Just chop me like a lime
Be a love that loves forever
Be a love that's so divine
Call it holy, holy
Holy, holy
Holy, holy
Holy, holy love
So in desperation
Caught by the swallowing man
If I were your father, I'd beat you hard
Slap you down with the palm of my hand
We could be so ambitious
Naked, not for long
Run to the hills and wait for me
I'll meet you there at dawn
Me, I wait for no one
Be it every single time
Be a love that loves forever
Be a love that's so divine
Call it holy, holy
Holy, holy
Holy, holy
Holy, holy love
Hurry back, hurry to the scene of the crime
I can't stand that noise in my ears
Well, I'll soon be saying, shouting, screaming
Things I've known for years

Me and my adrenaline
And every single time
Need a love that loves forever
Need a love that's so divine
Call it holy, holy
Holy, holy
Holy, holy
Holy, holy loveEmbed
