Reynard the Fox LyricsHey, in the pouring rain
When the smell of terror brings a thousand eyes
The red men come again
They kill my children and they kill my wife
And then they leave me bleeding
Family dead, just freaking out, bleeding
Stoned in the gutter, empty of my colour

I'm fried, fried, ticking in the side
Body twitched from side to side
I'm fried, fried, ticking in the side
Body twitched from side to side

Run, run, Reynard, run, run, run
You've got to run for an hour and you're still not done
You've got to run, run, Reynard, run, run, run
Away, away, away, away, away
Hey, in the ice and snow
When the call-up sounds to the real in deed
But do you really wanna know
How we rode into freedom on whimsy and greed?
And greed said your time is over
I don't see any gallant calls
I don't see an inch of reflex
'cept to leave me bleeding
Bleeding, bleeding, bleeding
 (x4)
Reynard left and went to Warwickshire
To a mound near a railway line with canals and a freezing swamp
He climbs high up above the countryside and breathes freely
To the south he could see Polesworth
And to the North he could just make out the ruins of the priory
Where Joss and I played cricket as children
We were only 3 miles away (Have you heard about the orphan)
Probably drinking tea and talking (Sitting by the coffin)
At the same time as he was (Have you heard about the orphan)
Taking the stanley knife out of the bag (Sitting by the coffin)
He pushed the point (His Father's not a sinner no more, oh no)
Into his stomach (His Father's not a sinner no more)
Until the light shone right through
And then he reached down
And he took the bag
It's a plastic bag
With plastic handles
And plastic sides
And
And
And
And
AND
HE SPILLED HIS GUTS ALL OVER THE STAGE
