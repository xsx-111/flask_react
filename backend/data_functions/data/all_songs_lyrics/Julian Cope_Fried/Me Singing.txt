Me Singing LyricsI may be there
Maybe try to comfort me with
My vacant stare
Which hangs above your vacant chair
Your eyes are lost in mine
Or are they my eyes lost in yours
I try to entwine
The wonder that we have there
Oh no, no, dear
Have you been coming here again?
Listening to me singing
Or is it me singing loud and clear
And I was not without you
But I tried so hard to be you
No, no, not without you
I'm being very good at being you
But all the times that we shared
I knew that my eyesight was being impaired
I knew something was wrong
And I soon found it was bad
And everything I do
Seems to be reflecting you
I try my hand at work
Oh, work seems to be for an earlier person
I'm not too late
Please don't leave me out there, you say
"You're not too late
To come and hear me singing"
All the time
I feel bad all the time
I was there singing
I was there singing
But you never knew
All the times I spent being you
To make up for you not being here
And all those times we sharedEmbed
