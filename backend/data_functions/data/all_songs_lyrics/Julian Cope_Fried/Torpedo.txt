Torpedo LyricsIf I knew
That there was any other way to you
I'd walk sound and miles
Any other way, get close to you
But you I could never share
Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way
And everything I have to say
Has probably been said many better ways
Sometimes I have you in my head
And loving with you, I am happy
I think of things to say to you
Of evenings we spent in another place
And everything feels so good here
Hand in hand in this other place
The things I do make you stare
Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way
I sit alone and take care of my head
All the feelings that I have in front of me
Changes that we could have made
All the things that we could have done together
But you I could never share
Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way
And everything I have to say
Has probably been said many better waysEmbed
