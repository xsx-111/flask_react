Where Dreams Go To Die LyricsYour beauty is unstoppable; your confidence unspeakable
I know you know I know you know that I know that you know
I'm willing to do anything to get attention from you, dear
Even though I don't have anything that I could bargain with
This is like a well-oiled machine. Could I please see that smile again?
It's all that makes me feel that I am living in this world
I see you closing all the doors, I see the walls as they go up
I know it's what you have to do, I'd probably do the same thing, too, my dear

Baby, you're where dreams go to die
I regret the day your lovely carcass caught my eye
Baby, you're where dreams go to die
I've got to get away. I don't want to, but I have to try
Oh, baby!
You have to play your part, my dear. I've written it all down for you
It doesn't matter if the things you say to me aren't true
Just do it then I'll let you go, Just say the words and say them slowly
I promise I'll tell no one, Yes, I cross my heart and hope to die


Oh, baby!
Oh, baby!
Oh, baby, please!Embed
