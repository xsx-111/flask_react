TC and Honeybear Lyrics
For TC and his Honeybear
The world will not stop moving
Rendezvous and longing stares
And hearts that won't stop burning
Before that Honeybear had given up
He felt so sad and lonely
Then one night he looked up and he saw
He saw his one and only

TC came onto the scene
He entered in on golden wings
With him he brought butterflies
Of crimson red and emerald green
Before TC, Honeybear was waiting
Was waiting for him patiently
TC took his fear away
Became his one and only


The world came crashing down on them
With all of its ferocity
And Honeybear was terrified
He said do not take him, take me
Before that Honeybear had given up
He felt so sad and lonely
Then one night he looked up and he saw
He saw his one and only
He said please don't take him
'Cause I love him
He's my joy and my life
For my love, I won't hesitate
I will give him all that his heart can take
And I'll trust him fearlessly
I want him to be free2Embed
