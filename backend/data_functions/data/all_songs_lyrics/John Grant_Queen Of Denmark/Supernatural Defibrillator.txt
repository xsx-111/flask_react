Supernatural Defibrillator Lyrics
Boy you knock me on my ass so hard
How could I know that you was holding that ace card
When I saw you my jaw hit the floor
Now I don't want them other boys no more
You sent a laser beam of love to my soul
You made me shake so hard I lose control
My sweet director won't you give me the part
'Cause you're the one who jump started my heart

'Cause you're my supernatural defibrillator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my heavenly re-animator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my super sexy stimulator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my loneliness exterminator

Come on baby 'fore I come unglued
Don't make me wait boy that would be so rude
You got me where I always wanted to be
Right in front of you and down on my knees
I feel like someone punched me right in my head
I need to lay down baby take me to bed
You leave me gobsmacked, dumbfounded, twitterpated
Bound and struck, stunned and shot, fuddled, discombobulated
'Cause you're my supernatural defibrillator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my heavenly re-animator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my super sexy stimulator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my loneliness exterminator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are supernatural defibrillator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my heavenly re-animator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my super sexy stimulator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my loneliness exterminator


'Cause you're my supernatural defibrillator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my heavenly re-animator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my super sexy stimulator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my loneliness exterminator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are supernatural defibrillator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my heavenly re-animator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my super sexy stimulator (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You are my loneliness exterminatorEmbed
