Jesus Hates Faggots Lyrics
I've felt uncomfortable since the day that I was born
Since the day I glimpsed the black abyss in your eyes
There's no way you could make all of this shit up on your own
It could only come from the mastermind of lies

I can't believe that I've considered taking my own life
'Cause I believed the lies about me were the truth
It will be magic to watch your transformation when you realize that you've been had
It's enough to make a guy like me feel sad

'Cause you tell me that
Jesus, he hates fruit loops, son
We told you that when you were young
Or pretty much anything you want him to
Like sitcoms, pedophiles and kangaroos
Morons who cut in line
Three-bean salad and parking fines
And when we win this war on society
I hope your blind eyes will be opened and you'll see

The arrogance it takes to walk around in the world the way you do
It turns my brain to jelly every time
The rage and fear I'm feeling have begun to make me sick
And I think that I might be about to commit a crime
And you tell me that
Jesus, he hates homos, son
We told you that when you were young
Or pretty much anything you want him to
Like Cocoa Puffs, red cars and Jews
Postal clerks who waste your time
Weight loss shakes, and the local news
And when we win the war on society
I hope your blind eyes will be opened and you'll see

'Cause Jesus, he hates faggots, son
We told you that when you were young
Or pretty much anyone you want him to
Like niggers, spics, redskins and kikes
Men who cannot tame their wives
Weaklings, cowards, and bull dykes
And when we win the war on society
I hope your blind eyes will be opened and you'll seeEmbed
