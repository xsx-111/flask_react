Silver Platter Club Lyrics
I wish that I could get up in the early morning time
Things would fall out of the sky into my lap
I wish I had the brain of a tyrannosaurus rex
So that I wouldn't have to deal with all this crap
I wish that I'd been born with skin that turned to golden brown
While at the beach relaxing in the summer time
I wish that I was good at football, baseball and lacrosse
Darts and basketball, and poker, golf and chess

I'm sorry that they didn't hand it to me
On a silver platter, like they did to you
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to become
The man you think I should aspire to

I wish I had the genes of Eduardo Ver√°stegui
That I was effortlessly masculine as well
I wish that confidence was all you could see in my eyes
Like those interviews in locker rooms with talented sports guys
I wish I had no self-awareness like the guys I know
Float right through their lives without a thought
And that I didn't give a shit what anybody thought of me
That I was so relaxed you'd think that I was bored
I'm sorry that they didn't hand it to me
On a silver platter, like they did to you
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to become
The man you think I should aspire to


I'm sorry that they didn't hand it to me
On a silver platter, like they did to you
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to become
The man you think I should aspire to

I'm sorry that they didn't hand it to me
(I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry)
On a silver platter, like they did to you
(I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry)
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to become
(I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry)
The man you think I should aspire to
(I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry)
I'm sorry that they didn't hand it to me
(I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry)
On a silver platter, like they did to you
(I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry)
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to become
(I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry)
The man you think I should aspire to
(I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry)
I'm sorry that they didn't hand it to me
(I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry)
On a silver platter, like they did to you
(Was that my other one?)Embed
