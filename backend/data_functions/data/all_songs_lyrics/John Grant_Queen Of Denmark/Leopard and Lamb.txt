Leopard and Lamb Lyrics
Read your letter and finally I could cry
But I don’t really understand exactly why
I guess I cried because I knew it was the end
No more hate now, just learning to begin

Learning how to crawl across a floor that’s covered with glass
Learning how to look away and never to look back

I cannot fathom how we dragged it for so long
And I think we both know which one of us was wrong
But now I’m asked to act as if I didn’t feel
Anything from you, my friend, and it’s a bitter pill to swallow

You’re right, this world is cold and all that I can do
Is banish every thought of you, because you are so cruel

Watch the Simpsons to remember how you laugh
I miss your dark blue eyes, and staring at your back
My leopard, my lamb

You’re right, this world is cold and all that I can do
Is banish every thought of you, because you are so cruel
Like learning how to crawl across a floor that’s covered with glass
Like learning how to look away and never to look back1Embed
