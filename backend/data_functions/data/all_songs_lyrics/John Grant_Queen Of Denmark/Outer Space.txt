Outer Space Lyrics
I still don't know what I'm looking at
'Cause I've never seen anything like this before
I have a friend who's an astronomer
And he says he cannot help me
'Cause he doesn't have a clue

I think that you must be from outer space
Maybe from somewhere beyond the stars
I think you must be extraterrestrial
'Cause you can open up the heavens for me
With just one smile, just one smile, just one smile


What is that sound coming out of your mouth?
Cause I've never heard anything like that before
It sounds like a language from another galaxy
I wanna thank you 'cause you opened the door

I think that you must be from outer space
Maybe from somewhere beyond the stars
I think you must be extraterrestrial
'Cause you can open up the heavens for me
With just one smile, just one smile, just one smileEmbed
