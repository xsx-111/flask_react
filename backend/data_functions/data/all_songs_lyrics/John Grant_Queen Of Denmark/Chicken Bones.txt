Chicken Bones Lyrics
When I got out of my bed this morning
I noticed that it didn't have a right side
And my head feels like it's filled to the top
With Pop Rocks and cyanide
There's an earthquake coming, and you think you know
Where it started, but it started very long ago
I need a mongoose, baby
And some Calgon to take me up outta here

Some days it's just chicken bones
You'd better fuck off now, you'd better leave me alone
Cause I'm about to explode, just like a Wonderbread bomb
And I don't care what I know, because I can't be wrong
Some days it's just chicken bones
You'd better fuck off now, you'd better leave me alone
Cause I'm about to explode, just like a Wonderbread bomb
And I don't care what I know, because I can't be wrong

Yes I know why you need it, cause your car broke down
And you wanna take the next bus outta this town
But if anybody's gettin' on the bus
Dawg, it's gonna be me
I know I don't need what you've got for me
But maybe I do theoretically
You'd better watch out sugar
Cause I'm about to get my Old Spice on
Some days it's just chicken bones
You'd better fuck off now, you'd better leave me alone
Cause I'm about to explode, just like a Wonderbread bomb
And I don't care what I know, because I can't be wrong
Some days it's just chicken bones
(Some days it's just chicken bones)
I'm all jacked up on DC at my place alone
And I don't care what you think about my attitude
Because I can't be bothered with the likes of you
(With the likes of you)

Some days it's just chicken bones
(Some days it's just chicken bones)
You'd better fuck off now, you'd better leave me alone
Cause I'm about to explode, just like a Wonderbread bomb
And I don't care what I know, because I can't be wrong
(I can't be wrong)
Some days it's just chicken bones
(Some days it's just chicken bones)
I'm all jacked up on DC at my place alone
And I don't care what you think about my attitude
Because I can't be bothered with the likes of you
(With the likes of you)Embed
