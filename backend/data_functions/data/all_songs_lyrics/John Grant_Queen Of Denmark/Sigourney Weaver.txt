Sigourney Weaver LyricsWhen I woke up today, the air was very strange
I couldn't feel my skin, and there was evil in my bones
I tried to speak but found that I didn't have a voice
It was a prison like the one you would find in the Twilight Zone
And I feel just like Sigourney Weaver
When she had to kill those aliens
And one guy tried to get them back to the Earth
And she couldn't believe her ears
So I was taken or I went towards what was west
To where the ground was dead
And struck out at the giant sky
The sky was black and filled with tiny silver holes
And it was there, with a frightened voice, that I began to cry out loud
I feel just like Winona Ryder
In that movie about vampires
And she couldn't get that accent right;
Neither could that other guy
And I feel just like I am on Jupiter
The one that looks like rainbow sherbet
But it doesn't lend itself to life
And I haven't finished yetEmbed
