Caramel Lyrics
My love is the rarest jewel
And he grounds me with his love
My love, he is rich like caramel
And he moves me from above

He sees me with tiger eyes
And thatâ€™s where I make my home
His heart is a shield
Which protects me from the vilest foe
His smile's an elixir
Which heals the wounds of my darkest years
When my love is quiet
I consider him, and he drives away my fears

My love, he reveals himself with tenderness and grace
My love has constructed with his arms for me the safest place
His laughter destroys my doubts and lifts me up so high
His voice it is soothing like a warm breeze on a Summer night
When he envelops me, I give myself to him, and my soul takes flightEmbed
