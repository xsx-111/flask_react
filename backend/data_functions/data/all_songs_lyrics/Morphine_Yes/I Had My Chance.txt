I Had My Chance Lyrics
I had my chance and I let it go
I had my chance and I let it go
Well, if I ever have myself another chance like that
I'm gonna grab it and I won't look back
I'm gonna grab it and I won't look back

Sometimes I'm too careful
I walk just like I'm carrying a hand grenade
It's going tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
Ticking ticking ticking in my hand
It's going tick tick tick tick ticking in my hand
Tick tick ticking in my hand

And if I ever have myself another chance like that
I'm gonna grab it and I won't look back
Yeah, if I ever have myself another chance like that
I'm gonna grab it and I won't look back
I'm gonna grab it and I won't look backEmbed
