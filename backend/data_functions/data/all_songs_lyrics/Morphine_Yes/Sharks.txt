Sharks Lyrics
Sharks patrol these waters
Sharks patrol these waters
Don't let your fingers dangle in the water
And don't you worry about the dayglow orange life preserver
It won't save you
It won't save you
Swim for the shores just as fast as your able
Swim like a motherfucker, swim!

Fast as that the scene shifts to now
The ever glorious now the ever present now
Drenched in flour and deep-fat-fried
And cooled on paper towels and then devoured
You know, I spent 15 years in a life raft
15 years in a life raft and now I got something to say

Stay in your life boats people
Stay in your life boats people
It's murder out there, murder out there
Sharks patrol these waters
Sharks patrol these waters, hey!
Don't you worry about the dayglow orange life preserver
It won't save you
It won't save you
Swim for the shores just as fast as your able, swim!Embed
