Gone for Good Lyrics
I'm never going back never going back to you
I'm never going to see you again
I'm never going to dig out your picture
I'm never going to look you up someday

Life is very short
You don't love me anymore

So I'm never going to see you again

I'm never going to write you a letter
Never going to call you on the phone
I'm never going to drive by your house
I'm never going to catch you coming outside

Never going to walk up your walk
And ring your bell
And feel you fall into my arms

I'm never going to see you
I'm never going to see you
I'm never going to see you again
You're gone for goodEmbed
