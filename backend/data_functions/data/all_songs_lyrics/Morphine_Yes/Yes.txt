Yes Lyrics
Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes
Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes
(Yes (x12))

If you can't decide what to do with your life
You just don't know what it is that's right
If you just don't know what to do
You just don't know what's right for you
If you can't decide where to go with your life
You just don't know where to spend your time
If you can't decide where to go with your life
I'm sure you'll do whatever is right
I've always known you were incredibly bright

Get in your go-kart and go little sister
Get in your go-kart and go
Get in your go-kart and go little sister
Get in your go-kart and go
Get in your go-kart and go little sister
Get in your go-kart and go
Get in your go-kart and go little sister
Get in your go-kart and go
And then swing your swift sword sister
Swing your swift sword now
Swing your swift sword sister sister
Swing your swift sword now
Swing your swift sword sister
Swing your swift sword now
Swing your swift sword sister sister sisterEmbed
