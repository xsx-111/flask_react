Free Love Lyrics
Free love, oh! what is it?
Free love oh I can't stand it it's a panic
Normally love costs a bundle and plenty of trouble
But you fooled me you fooled me
You ran away to Italy
You fooled me
Yea you fooled me you fooled me
You ran away to Italy
With your psychiatrist who's now a scientologist
Oh! I should have foreseen this
Business with your psychiatrist

Free love don't bank on it baby
Don't bank on it
Don't bank on it
Don't bank on it
Don't bank on it baby free love

So the next time someone offers you free love you know it
You better run run for shelter run for help
Run for the nearest downtown lounge in the afternoon
Run for for the cynical arms of a stranger
Run for the open arms of an unknown tomorrow
Because love love love is expensive ahh
Free love don't bank on it baby
Don't bank on it
Don't bank on it
Don't bank on it
Don't bank on it baby free love
Don't bank on it baby
Don't bank on it
Don't bank on it
Don't bank on it
Don't bank on it baby free loveEmbed
