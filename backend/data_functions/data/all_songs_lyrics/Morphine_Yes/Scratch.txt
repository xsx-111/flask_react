Scratch Lyrics
I was once sitting on top of the world
I really had things in my hand
But something went wrong I'm not sure what
And now I'm sitting here at home alone
People they want to give you free advice
Well that's something that I always try
But you get what you pay for that's what I say
And now I'm paying and paying and paying

I lost everything I had
I'm starting over from scratch
I lost everything I had
I'm starting over from scratch

Everything I wanted cooking on the stove
Everything I needed right in the home
I had the best thing you can have
You can have it, you can have it now

I lost everything I had
I'm starting over from scratch
I lost everything I had
I'm starting over from scratch
Testify!

Wipe that smile off my face
Put me down in a proper place
But the world just keeps on spinning around
And I'm still hanging around in this world

I lost everything I had
I'm starting over from scratch
I lost everything I had
I'm starting over from scratch1Embed
