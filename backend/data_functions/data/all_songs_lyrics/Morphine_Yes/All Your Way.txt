All Your Way Lyrics
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah

Let's put it to bed, let's put it down
I can't talk about it not right now
On my dying day I might be able to say
On a still sea full of manly rage
On my dying day I might be able to say
I might be able to say
You know I finally see things all your way
All your way

Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah

I was raised with the strong of heart
But if you touch me wrong I fall apart
I found a woman who's soft but she's also hard
While I slept, she nailed down my heart
I run good but I'm hard to start
And my brakes are bad so I'm hard to stop
I found a woman who's soft but she's also hard
While I slept, she nailed down my heart

Let's put it to bed, let's put it down
I can't talk about it not right now
On my dying day I might be able to say
On a still sea full of manly rage
On my dying day I might be able to say
Where every word explodes in my face
I might be able to say
You know I finally see things all your way
I finally see things all your way1Embed
