A Minor Aversion LyricsI've taken all I can
I'm not gonna stand here
And be walked on no more
'Cause I don't need you
These days your facts
They don't mean a thing, no
And you think I'm gonna walk that line
Believe your lies all of the time
But you don't make me your fool anymore
I've waited so long
You kept me here
With all the lies you told
And you think that I
Will stay the same
Yeah, you think you got me
But don't you know this thing can't last
And don't you know that time will pass
These dreams are not your own anymore
I've been waitin' for too long
I've been watchin', honey, I ain't wrong
I'm not waitin' anymore, no, no
Not anymore
I've taken all I can
I'm not gonna stand here
And be walked on no more
'Cause I don't need you
These days your facts
They don't mean a thing, no
And you think I'm gonna walk that line
Believe your lies all of the time
But you don't make me your fool anymore
I've been waitin' for too long
I've been watchin', honey, I ain't wrong
I'm not waitin' anymore, no, no
I've been waitin' for too long
I've been watchin', honey, I ain't wrong
I'm not waitin' anymore, no, no
I said not anymoreEmbed
