Know Your Product Lyrics(Yeah
All right
Sing it up, west coast
Too much!)
I'm just sitting in my chair when a voice comes on the air
Says "Why don't you try it? You'll feel all right!"
"Got some great new brand of smokes, cool your head and clear your throat
"Keeps you young, yeah, so in touch."
Cheap advertising, you're lying
Never gonna get me what I want
I said, smooth talking, brain washing
Ain't never gonna get me what I need
"Our new soap that's peachy keen saves your soul and keeps you clean
"It's recommended, used by the Queen
"Gonna improve your IQ, help in everything you do
"It's economic, don't cost too much."
Said advertising, you're lying
Never gonna give me what I want
I said, smooth talking, brain washing
Ain't never gonna get me what I need
(I said take it
Come on
Soul man
Let's shoot the professor!
Alright!)
I'm just sitting in my chair when a voice comes on the air
Says "Why don't you try it? You'll feel all right!"
"It's a great new brand of smokes
"Cool your head and clears your throat
"Keeps you young and so in touch."
Said advertising, you're lying
You're never gonna give me what I want
I said smooth talking, brain washing
You're never gonna get me what I need
(What do I care?
Yeah! Hey man
Where's the professor?
We need him now!
Gonna tell you 'bout them
Yeah we take it all the way 'round the world
For that west coast feel
Yeah man
Yeah everything, let it out
It's not what you love
Look out on the radio
All right
Yeah
Yeah...)Embed
