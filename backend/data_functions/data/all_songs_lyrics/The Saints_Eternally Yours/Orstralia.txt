Orstralia LyricsI don't live this life for me
In Orstralia, land so free
Everybody lazing in the sun
And nobody cares, so let's have fun
We got no problems, got no wars
And you don't need your brain no more
No, sir
Orstralia goes in once again
We must remember all our friends
And to make sure always
That we support the CIA
We got no problems, got no wars
And you don't need your brain no more
No, sir
Hang your washin' on the line
It's okay, the weather's fine
Your hubby goes out, don't commit no crime
He always gets to work on time
We got no problems, got no wars
And you don't need your brain no more
No, sir
(You know you're blah, blah, blah)
In Orstralia
(In your own backyard)
In Orstralia
(So come on, let's have fun)
