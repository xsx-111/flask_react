Private Affair LyricsYou say that you got the answers
You heard 'em all on the telephone
And now you're tellin' everybody
This living co-op ain't a business zone, c'mon
We've got new thoughts, new ideas, it's all so groovy
It's just a shame that we've all seen the same old movies
And now you think you got a first in fashion
New uniforms, we all look the same
A new vogue for the now generation
A new profit in the same old game, c'mon
We've got new thoughts, new ideas, it's all so groovy
It's just a shame that we have seen the same old movies
And you think you can't run and hide what you've done
But don't you know? No-one cares after the first million, c'mon
And now you think you got a first in fashion
New uniforms, we all look the same
A new vogue for the now generation
A new profit in the same old game, c'mon
We've got new thoughts, new ideas, we're all so groovy
It's just a shame that we've all seen the same old movies
So you think you can't run and hide what you've done
And don't you know? No-one cares after the first million, c'mon
It's a shame
'Cause not everybody wants to look the same
And not everybody wants to think the same
And not everybody wants to act the same
And I say everybody don't wanna be the sameEmbed
