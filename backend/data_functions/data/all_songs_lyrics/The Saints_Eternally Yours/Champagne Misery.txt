Champagne Misery LyricsShe said she thinks she's going down again
'Cause she's so tired now of all her friends
And she'd like to go away
Spend some time in a foreign place
It's no good
Just don't know what to do
She said her life is full of misery
She dreams of places where she'd rather be
And she'd like to go away
Spend some time in a foreign place
It's no good
Just don't know what to do
She has no time for, and she doesn't like anyone
She's not content, and she doesn't have any fun
She said she thinks she's going down again
'Cause she's so tired now of all her friends
And she'd like to go away
Spend some time in a foreign place
It's no good
Just don't know what to do
She has no time for, and she doesn't like anyone
She's not content, and she don't have any fun
Poor little girl, she doesn't have any fun
Poor little girl, not loved by anyone
Oh, little girl
Oh, little girl
Oh, little girl
Oh, little girlEmbed
