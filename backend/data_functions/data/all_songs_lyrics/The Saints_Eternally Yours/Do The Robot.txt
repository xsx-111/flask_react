Do The Robot LyricsC'mon, everybody, and listen to Chris
There's a great new dance and it goes like this
There's a great new dance that we're doin' down yonder
C'mon, everybody, it's called doin' the robot
Your mother won't do it but your sister, she will
C'mon, little baby, don't you know that you will
An' all the hot cats on the block have been doin' it too
C'mon, now, honey, I wanna do it with you
Well c'mon, well c'mon, well c'mon
Let's do the robot
There's a great new dance that we're doin' down yonder
C'mon, everybody, it's called doin' the robot
Your mother won't do it but your sister, she will
C'mon, now, honey, don't you know that you will
'Cause all the hot cats on the block have been doing it too
C'mon, now, honey, I wanna do it with you
Well c'mon, well c'mon, well c'mon
Let's do the robot
There's a great new dance that we're doin' down yonder
C'mon, little baby, it's called doin' the robot
If your mother won't do it, then your sister, she will
C'mon, now, baby, don't you know that you will
'Cause all the hot cats on the block have been doin' it too
C'mon, now, honey, I wanna do it wit' you
Well c'mon, well c'mon, well c'mon
Let's do the robot
I wanna be a robot
I wanna be a robot
Nine thousand robots
See you're a one of themEmbed
