Untitled LyricsI've taken a chance more than I have before
When I look at you, girl, I don't need no more
I can't understand these feelings of mine
Because of you, it's gonna be all right
You know that chance, girl, it don't often come
This world, it gets you, and it keeps you on the run
I've messed around, yeah, I've wasted my time
But someone like you, girl, is so hard to find
These days will soon be past
But memories, I know will last
Of the times I spend with you
Babe, I know what I been told
But there's something here that I can hold
And I know because of you
Come on
You know that chance, girl, it don't often come
This world, it gets you, and it keeps you on the run
I've messed around, yeah, I wasted my time
But someone like you, girl, is so hard to find
These days will soon be past
But memories, I know will last
Of the times I spend with you
Babe, I know what I been told
But there's something here that I can hold
And I know because of you
Take it
These days will soon be past
But memories, I know will last
Of the times I spend with you
And babe, I know what I been told
But there's something here that I can hold
And I know because of youEmbed
