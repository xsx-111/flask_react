Lost and Found LyricsAin't nobody tells me what to do now
I've heard all the lies and been promised the world
No businessman is gonna use or confuse me
'Cause I ain't no puppet for his capital gain
And what do you get but exploitation
From creeps who are gonna ignore your situation?
Too many people gettin' pushed around
Gonna end up down the lost and found
They say I gotta respect the system
But there ain't no respect in that system for me
You gotta be satisfied and show no resistance
If you wanna get to the top of that tree
And what do you get but exploitation
From creeps who are gonna ignore your situation?
Too many people gettin' pushed around
Gonna end up down the lost and found
They give you media minds to keep you satisfied
Then take your brain away to appease and make you smile
No more!
Ain't nobody tells me what to do now
I've heard all the lies and been promised the world
No businessman is gonna use or confuse me
'Cause I ain't no puppet for his capital gain
And what do you get but exploitation
From creeps who are gonna ignore your situation?
Too many people gettin' pushed around
I'm gonna end up deep in the, the lost and found
And that ain't me, babe!
Down, down, down . . Embed
