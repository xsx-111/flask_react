Wild Tyme (H) Lyrics
It's a wild time
I see people all around me changing faces
It's a wild time
I'm doing things that haven't got a name yet
I need love, your love
It don't matter if it's rain or shine

It's a wild time
It's a wild time
It's a wild time
It's a wild time
It's a wild time (I need love all the time)
It's a wild time (And I've seen love all the time)
I'm here for you any old time
Ah, stay here, play here
Make a place for yourself here

I want to be with you
No matter what I do
What doesn't change is the way I feel for you today
Times just seem so good
I do know that I should be here with you this way
And it's new, and it's new
And it's all so new
I see changes, changes
All around me are changes
It's a wild time
It's a wild time
It's a wild time
It's a wild time
It's a wild time
It's a wild timeEmbed
