The Last Wall of the Castle Lyrics
Gone swirling tears came she went today
Down fallen years go by
No place in learning how to cry
I went astray

Understanding is a virtue hard to come by
You can teach me how to love
If you'll only try
So please
Don't give up so soon

Sorry that I hurt her I went astray
Hurt her mind and broke her heart
But there's no stopping once you start
She went away

Understanding is a virtue hard to come by
You can teach me how to love
If you'll only try
So please
Don't give up so soon
I never knew you the way you are
The blinded bird is not sincere
His flying's done from only fear
He's lost his star

Understanding is a virtue hard to come by
You can teach me how to love
If you'll only try
So please
Don't give up so soon2Embed
