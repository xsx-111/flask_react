Martha Lyrics
Martha she listens for the ticking of my footsteps
Patiently
She sifts the hairy air that's worn and wood-swept
Pleasantly

She does as she pleases
She listens for me

Martha she calls to me from a feather in the meadow
Fly to me
You can dance and sing and walk with me
And dreams will fade and shadows grow in weed

She does as she pleases
She waits there for me
She does as she pleases
Her heels rise for me

My love she talks to winking windows as she murmurs to her feet
Thoughtfully
She separates in laughter to my side
Caught for me
She does as she pleases
She waits there for me
She does as she pleases
Her heels rise for me

Martha she keeps her heart in a broken clock
And it's waiting there for me
She weeds apart through a token lock
What a great thing to be free
She weeps time, starts unspoken, but when the gate swings
There she'll be, there she'll be
In green sun, on blue earth, under warm running showerEmbed
