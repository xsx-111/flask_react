Young Girl Sunday Blues LyricsIn my heart I have a feeling, and I don't know what I'm gonna do;
Oh, what a beautiful world, the world, what should I do? What should I do?
Don't you know what I have found? Maybe you've found it too;
Today is made up of yesterday and tomorrow
Young girl Sunday blues and all her sorrow
One side of me is filled with brightness, no matter what I might say;
The days are made with waterfall colors, couldn't I make you stay?
If rain slides down the sides of my face must be a rainy day;
But I get lost in yesterday and tomorrow, tomorrow
Young girl Sunday blues and all her sorrow
I walk beside you laughing and I'm high, don't try to touch me with words;
When I tell you I dream it might seem like silence, but so much can be heard;
I think of things, what loving you brings, maybe my thing is her;
Today is made of yesterday and tomorrow
Young girl Sunday blues, and all her sorrow;
Ah! come into my mind, let yourself wander free and easy;
Ah! come into my life, Sunday blues girl, young and new girl
You're the only true girl here can please me
I said, "Please me, yeah! Please me! Please me! Please me!"Embed
