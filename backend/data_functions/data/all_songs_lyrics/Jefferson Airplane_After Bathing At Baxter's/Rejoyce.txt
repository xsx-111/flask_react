Rejoyce Lyrics
Chemical change, like a laser beam
You've shot the warning amber light
Wake me warm
Let me see you moving everything over
Smiling in my room you know
You'll be inside of my mind soon

There are so many of you
White shirt and tie
White shirt and tie
White shirt and tie
Wedding ring
Wedding ring

Mulligan stew for Bloom
The only Jew in the room
Saxon's sick on the holy dregs
And they're constant getting throw up on his leg
Molly's gone to blazes
Boylan's crotch amazes
Any woman whose husband sleeps with his head
All buried down at the foot of his bed
I've got his arm
I've got his arm
I've had it for weeks
I've got his arm

Steven won't give his arm
To no gold star mother's farm
War's good business so give your son
And I'd rather have my country die for me

There are so many of you
Sell your mother for a Hershey bar
Grow up looking like a car
There are
All you want to do is live
All you want to do is live
But somehow

It all
Falls
