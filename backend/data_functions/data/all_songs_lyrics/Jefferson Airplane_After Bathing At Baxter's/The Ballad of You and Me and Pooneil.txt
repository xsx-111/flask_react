The Ballad of You and Me and Pooneil LyricsIf you were a bird and you lived very high
You leaned on the wind as the breeze came by
Say to the wind as it took you away
"That's where I wanted to go today"
And I do know that I need to have you around
And I do know...
I do know that I need to have you around
Love like a mountain springtime
Flashing through the rivers of my mind;
It's what I feel for you...
Armadillo
You and me go walking south
And we see all the world around us
The colors blind my eyes and my mind to all but you
And I do know that I need to have you around
And I do...
I do know that I need to have you around
I have a house where I can go
When there's too many people around me;
I can sit and then watch all the people
Down below goin' by me;
Halfway down the stair is a stair
Where I sit and think about you and me;
But I wonder will the sun still see all the people goin' by
Will the moon still hang in the sky
When I die
(When I die)
When I'm high
(When I die)
When I die
If you were a cloud and you sailed up there
You sail on water as blue as air
You'd see me here in the fields and say
"Doesn't the sky look green today?"
But I wonder will the sun still see all the people goin' by
Will the moon still hang in the sky
When I die
(When I die)
When I die
When I'm high
When I die
Die, die, die, die1Embed
