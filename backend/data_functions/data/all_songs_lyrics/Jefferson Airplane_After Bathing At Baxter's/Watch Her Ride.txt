Watch Her Ride LyricsI didn't know you were the one for me
I couldn't see but you were waiting
For someone to come along
To help you out to sing your song
And I was changing
All I see is you
All I feel is you for me
And I would really like to watch you ride
And always feel you by my side
I would really like to watch you ride
All on me
I go stumbling to the sky
And I seem to fly so high
I see you
I feel you
You have a way of walking 'round
Your feet they never touch the ground
And you are shining
All I see is you
All I feel is you for me
Times don't change
Times don't ever change for me
And I know that you could be
The only thing in my world
The only thing that my mind would find for love
For love and peace of mind
For me
For me
Yeaooooh oh oh oh oh oooooh
Your Shadow in the morning sun becomes my fun
And we can say "I love you, I love you"
My morning shines on silver beaches
Your light flashes to the reaches
Of my mind, of my mind, of my mind
And my mind it comes alive with you
It's all that I can do
To sit here and let you blow my mind
Oh my mind
You're so fine
In my mind
You're so fine
In my mind
You're so fine
In my mind
You're so fine (In my mind)
You're so fine...Embed
