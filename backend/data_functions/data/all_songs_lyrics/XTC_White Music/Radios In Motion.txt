Radios In Motion LyricsWell, there's a message up in China
That they're getting in Japan
It's bouncing off an ocean liner
And make 'em shake 'em in Siam
And all my kids are complaining
That there's nowhere to go
And all my kids are complaining
That the songs are too slow
All I'm saying is you're deaf
To the fact that there's
Radios in motion
Atmosphere to ocean
Radios in motion
Gets you out of your red, white and blues
When we move then so do you
Well, there's a message in Milwaukee
And that they're getting in Moscow
And everybody walkie talkie
And everybody learning how
And all my kids are complaining
That there's nowhere to go
And all my kids are complaining
That the songs are too slow
All I'm saying is you're deaf
To the fact that there's
Radios in motion
Atmosphere to ocean
Radios in motion
Gets you out of your red, white and blues
When we move then so do you
Well, there's a message up in China
And that they're getting in Japan
It's bouncing off an ocean liner
And make 'em shake 'em in Siam
And all the kids are complaining
That there's nowhere to go
And all the kids are complaining
That the songs are too slow
All I'm saying is you're deaf
To the fact that there's
Radios in motion
Atmosphere to ocean
Radios in motion
Gets you out of your red, white and blues
When we move then so do you
Radios in motion
Radios in motion
Radios in motion
Gets you out of your red, white and blues
When we move then so do youEmbed
