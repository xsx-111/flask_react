Cross Wires LyricsIt's the airwaves of the world
Not the hairwaves on your head
Oh But anything can be
On land and in the sea
When you've got
Crosswires
When you've got Crosswires
Everything is Buzz Buzz
Everything is Beep Beep
Strange things happen everyday
It's confusious the Chinese say
Brings a nation to its feet
It's them people that you meet
