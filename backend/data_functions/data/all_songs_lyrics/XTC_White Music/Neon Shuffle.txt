Neon Shuffle LyricsHey, what you going to do now?
You're standing there and wondering how
You, you got to make some noise
Just like one of the girls or even one of the boys
When you do it, it ain't no disgrace
I can see it written all across your face
Neon shuffle and shuffle into outer space
I said, "The neon shuffle is a dance for the human race"
I said, "The neon shuffle is gonna pull you outta your place"
You, you put your hands together
Better make up a storm or give some electricky weather
Now that the power's stopped
Can you click your heels, can your fingers pop?
When you do it, it ain't no disgrace
I can see it written all across your face
Neon shuffle and shuffle into outer space
I said, "The neon shuffle is a dance for the human race"
I said, :The neon shuffle is gonna pull you outta your place"
When you do it, it ain't no disgrace
I can see it written all across your face
Neon shuffle and shuffle into outer space
I said, "The neon shuffle is a dance for the human race"
I said, :The neon shuffle is gonna pull you outta your place"
Neon shuffle
Neon shuffle
Neon shuffle
Neon shuffle, it's going to do it to me
Neon shuffle, it's going to do it to you
Neon shuffle, it's going to do it with red
Neon shuffle, it's going to do it with blue
Neon shuffle, it's going to run you right through
Neon shuffle, with a stick of bamboo
Neon shuffle, it's going to run you right through
Neon shuffle, with a stick of bamboo
Bam bam bam bamboo
Bam bam bam bamboo
Bam bam bam bamboo
Neon
Neon
Neon
