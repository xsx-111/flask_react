Statue of Liberty LyricsThe first time I saw you standing in the water
You must have been all of a thousand feet tall
Nearly naked, unashamed like Herod's daughter
Your love was so big, it made New York look small
You've been the subject of so many dreams
Since I climbed your torso
Oh, my statue of Liberty
Boo boo
Impaled on your hair
What do you do, do, do to me
Boo boo
I leaned right over to kiss your stoney book
A little jealous of the ships with whom you flirt
A billion lovers with their cameras
Snap to look, and in my fantasy I sail beneath your skirt
You've been the subject of so many dreams
Since I climbed your torso
Oh, my statue of Liberty
Boo boo
Impaled on your hair
What do you do, do, do to me
Boo boo
Sing
Oh, my statue of Liberty
Boo boo
Impaled on your hair
What do you do, do, do to me
Boo boo
Liberty, liberty, libertyEmbed
