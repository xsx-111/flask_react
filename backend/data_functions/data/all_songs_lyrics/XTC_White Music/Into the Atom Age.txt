Into the Atom Age LyricsI'm heading into the atom age
My contemporary house is all the rage
My wife's getting lazy going gadget crazy
Wants a pallette shaped coffee table and a matching settee
I'm heading into the atom age
My kids have gone obscene want to marry at fourteen
Want a pallette shaped coffee table and a matching settee
I'm heading into the atom age
I flick on the video to soothe me
It's better colour than the real thing!
I relax to a three D porno movie
Hey does anyone remember whatever happened to string?
I'm heading into the atom ageEmbed
