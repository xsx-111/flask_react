New Town Animal in a Furnished Cage LyricsI think my watch has bust and so is time
I borrowed all my love so nothing's mine
There's nothing decent on the tv page
Like a new town animal in a furnished cage
It's gone eleven and the bar is shut
I'm sitting waiting like a real good mutt
I watch tv with an actor's rage
Like a new town animal in a furnished cageEmbed
