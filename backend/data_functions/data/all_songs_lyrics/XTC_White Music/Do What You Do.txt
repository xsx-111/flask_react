Do What You Do LyricsDo what you do what you
Do what you do what you
Do what you do to me
Do what you do what you
Do what you do what you
Do what you do to me
The stars are out and so am I
The stars I see, ain't in the sky
I'm heading, heading, heading for Twilight Zone
Please don't take me home
Do what you do what you
Do what you do what you
Do what you do to me
Do what you do what you
Do what you do what you
Do what you do to me
Do what you do what you
Do what you do what you
Do what you do to me
Do what you do what you
Do what you do what you
Do what you do to me
Do what you do what you
Do what you do what you
Do what you do to me
Do what you do what you
Do what you do what you
Do what you do to meEmbed
