Spinning Top LyricsI'm like a spinning top going 'round and around
Well, I don't know what's up and I sure
Don't know what's down, now watch me
I'm like a spinning top, I can't tell day from night
Well, I don't know what's wrong and I sure
Don't know what's right, now watch me
It started when I heard your song of love
Pouring down like honey from above
I started to spin, I started to move, just like a needle
That is sticking in the same old groove
I'm like a spinning top going 'round and around
Well, I don't know what's up and I sure
Don't know what's down, now watch me
I'm like a spinning top, I can't tell day from night
Well, I don't know what's wrong and I sure
Don't know what's right, now watch me
It started when I heard your song of love
Pouring down like honey from above
I started to spin, I started to move, just like a needle
That is sticking in the same old groove
I'm like a spinning top, I'm like a spinning top
I'm like a spinning top, I like it so much
That I'm never gonna stop
I'm like a spinning top, I'm like a spinning top
I'm like a spinning top, I like it so much
That I'm never gonna stopEmbed
