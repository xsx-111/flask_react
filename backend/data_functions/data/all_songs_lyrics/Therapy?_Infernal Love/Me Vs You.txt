Me Vs You LyricsI just came to get my things
I'm not drunk or anything
I saw a light on in your house
Undo the chain and let me in, I want to talk
I never wanted this disease
I never wanted you to leave, hey
I never wanted this disease
I never wanted you, I never wanted you to leave
It used to give me guilty thrills
Feeling in control and feeding on your innocence
I watched you torture yourself days
And fucking you got boring when it didn't feel so wrong
I never wanted this disease
I never wanted you to leave, hey
I never wanted this disease
I never wanted you, I never wanted you to leave
(I can see you in my dreams)
(I can see you in my dreams)
(I can see you in my dreams)
(I can see you in my dreams)
Let the grass grow over me
Let the grass grow over me
Let the grass grow over me
Let the grass grow over me
You watch the grass grow over me
You watch the grass grow over me
You watch the grass grow over me
You watch the grass grow over me
(I can see you in my dreams) I never wanted this disease
(I can see you in my dreams) I never wanted you except when you were on your knees
(I can see you in my dreams) I never wanted this disease
(I can see you in my dreams) I never, I never, I never wanted you to leave
