30 Seconds LyricsI can feel you breathing and you're sticking to my skin
Someone shut the morning up, my conscience creeps back in
I don't hear the words you say when you just come around
I don't hear the words you say, I just see you lie
There's one thing that I should remember
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There's one thing that I should remember
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
Buggered by a priest when you were seven years of age
The age of understanding came with blood and semen stains
All your hope in politics, handed back yourself
Is there anything as disgraceful I can see again
There's one thing that I should remember
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There's one thing that I should remember
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
How did we get from the blue lamp disco to cracking up in San Francisco
I look at myself in a sober light, I'm not Elvis but I'm alright
I can feel your breathing when you tear me from within
Unhinged and unravelled as you rip my fucking skin
I can put my head back on but it's the wrong way round
Feeling up the ladder, you won't get back down
There's one thing that I should remember
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There's one thing that I should remember
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There's one thing that I should remember
Oh, there is a light at the end of the tunnel
There's one thing that I should remember
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light at the end of the tunnelEmbed
