Diane LyricsHey little girl, wanna go for a ride?
There's room and my wagon is parked right outside
We can cruise down Robert Street all night long
But I think I'll just rape you and kill you instead
Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane)
Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane)
I hear there's a party at Lake Cove
It'd be so much easier if I drove
We could check it out, we can go and see
Come on, take a ride with me
Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane)
Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane)
Lay down together for a while
I'll put all your clothes in a nice neat little pile
You're the cutest girl I've ever seen in my life
But it's over now and with my knife
Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane)
Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane)
Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane)
Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane), Diane (Diane)Embed
