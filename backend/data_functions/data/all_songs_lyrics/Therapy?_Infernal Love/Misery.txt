Misery LyricsHere comes the misery, yeah yeah
Coming back to make me pay, yeah yeah
I wanted you haunting me, but not just yet
Give the memories time to blossom into regret
You come to my house
I don't know what you're talking about
I owe you nothing, I owe you nothing
You say you need friends or something
Just shut up, I'm feeling guilty
Get away from me I'm thinking
No way this again
You come and stand and face me, you're betrayed
Like I should say something or ask you to stay
And now you're gonna go all girlie on me
You always left me wanting
Now I want you to leave
You can talk about the things
That you say you left behind
While you lead me down
Dark alleys in the ghettos of your mind
You've got that look on your face
That I could never comprehend anyway
Fuck you waste my time
And tell me that you're broken hearted now
A long way back to where you've been
You cry alone
Martyrs alone
Here comes the misery, yeah yeah
Coming back to make me pay once again
I wanted you haunting me but not just yet
You better go before I do something I regret
You can run, call the cops
Cry your eyes out, give them the lot
You can say I marked your face
But you do these things to yourself anyway
I can never be with you
This is over, this is over, this is over
Hey hey heyEmbed
