Jude the Obscene LyricsHe was born the same time as me
To a small souled woman who died 23
Now you're here, they can't shove you back
I know you live your life out of spite
And I'm waiting for Jude the obscene (Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
I'm waiting for Jude the obscene (Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
(Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
(Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
The good ones first so get back in the queue
(So get back in the queue)
You trawled your way through our grim school
(You trawled your way through our grim school)
I hear your crowing in my sleep, in my dreams
A great dark wave shivers over me
I'm waiting for Jude the obscene (Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
I'm waiting for Jude the obscene (Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
(Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
(Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
(Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
(Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
(Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
(Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
Boys with bashed in eyes line the roads
(Boys with bashed in eyes line the roads)
But the longest walk was the walk back home
(The longest walk) Alone (was the walk back home)
Now you're here, they can't shove you back
You go on living your life out of spite
And I'm waiting for Jude the obscene (Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
I'm waiting for Jude the obscene (Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
I'm waiting for Jude the obscene (Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
Waiting for Jude the obscene (Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)
Waiting for Jude the obscene (Waiting, I'm waiting, I'm)Embed
