Epilepsy LyricsI've got a problem
This infernal love
It burns like wire
This infernal love
This infernal love
This infernal love
This infernal love
I've got a problem
I can't leave you alone
I don't want this
This infernal love
This infernal love
This infernal love
This infernal love
I've got a problem
This infernal love
It burns like wire
This infernal love
This infernal love
This infernal love
This infernal love
(Love Love Love Love)
