Bowels of Love LyricsYeah, you took me, naive and ugly, into your festering heart
And you poured Eros' maggots down my throat, until I choked
There's nothing darker than love that's gone sour
Satan's spit, love that's gone sour
Yeah, you took me, naive and ugly, into your festering heart
And you rammed Eros' maggots down my throat, until I choked
There's nothing darker than love that's gone sour, Satan's spit
Nothing darker than love that's gone sour, Satan's spit
Out of the bowels of love
Bowels of love
Bowels of love
Bowels of love
Out of the bowels of love
Bowels of love
Bowels of love
Bowels of love
Love
