Stories LyricsGet into the car and keep it down
City lights look like warnings now
She's got someone that pays for things
Trust me she won't miss a thing
Come with me and believe me
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
I get by on what I have
Less than Jesus, more than dad
Enough to keep me in this state
Ticking through to the next escape
Come with me and believe me
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
I woke up late and I rolled the stone
Laziness and death in one
You were once a gentleman
Ended up a bitter man
Come with me and believe me
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Yeah (happy people have no stories)
Happy people have no storiesEmbed
