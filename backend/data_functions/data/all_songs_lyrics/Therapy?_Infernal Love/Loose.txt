Loose LyricsLet me try on your dress, it turns me on when we're a mess
Something's kicking in, I smell the summer on your skin
I'm sick of being down, we're coming up so let's go out
We won't live forever now, so let's make the most of it somehow
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Your body is loose (You're going down)
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Today
I don't care where you're from, whatever planet you think you're on
'Cos you're my space cadet, I'll go anywhere with you, yeah
Maybe you're still lonely, but I love you, you're my best friend
We look like sister and brother, according to all our friends
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Your body is loose (You're going down)
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Today
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Your body loose (You're going down), yeah
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Today
There's no guns firing now, big yellow cranes hold up the clouds
And this season's changed me, I've fallen into a different skin
We make quite a pair and we look stupid, we don't care
We need no explanation, just keep on taking the happy pills
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Today
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Your body is loose (And you're going down), yeah
Your body is loose (And you're going down)
Today
Let me try on your dressEmbed
