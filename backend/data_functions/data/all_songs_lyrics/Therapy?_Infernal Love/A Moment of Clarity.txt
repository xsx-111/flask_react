A Moment of Clarity LyricsI thought of you tonight, in simple twists and turns
Incarcerated here, I'm handcuffed to your world
Your innocence is cruel, coquettish and arcane
But I need it all the same
I thought of you tonight, in silent seething heat
Through charred and damned desire, dark Eros wounding me
Your innocence is cruel, and your ass like Jesus feet
Worth kissing, worth kissing
Give yourself to me, I share your need
Give yourself to me and come to me
Give yourself to me, I share your need
Give yourself to me, I share your need
I thought of you tonight, through blank and starving eyes
In this one moment of clarity, blink the darkness in my eyes
Your lips like bruised vulva, your ass like Jesus feet
Worth kissing, give yourself to me
I thought of you tonight, in silent seething heat
Through charred and damned desire, dark Eros killing me
Your lips like bruised vulva, your ass like Jesus feet
Worth kissing, worth kissing
Give yourself to me, I share your need
Give yourself to me, I share your need
Give yourself to me, I share your need
Give yourself to me, I share your need
Kiss me through your warming darkness
Kiss me now so I can breathe
Kiss me once then I am leaving
Kiss me once then kiss yourself goodbye
I thought of you tonight, in simple twists and turns
Incarcerated here, I'm handcuffed to this worldEmbed
