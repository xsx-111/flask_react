Section Lyrics
I came too far to front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo
You can't front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section

Yo, y'all know the dynasty, The Roots repertoire
The Lieutenant from the reservoir, serve to spar
The injurer, predator of a competitor
I send MCs where the paramedics are
At first, I'm like "Nah", I'm nonchalant from afar
Then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
With irregular balance of the cat burgalar
Known to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars
I know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual
We congruent, lay on the corner with the traum' unit
I'm from the lab where the bomb's distributed
So never try to duplicate the skills executed
Son, you'd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed
Shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it
Some know me as the man that's from The Roots crew
Others as Bad Lieutenant off of Snyder Avenue
We go a eye for a eye, behead ya like a samurai
That'll command the dynasty until he die
Who will imply that I lack abilit-y?
Make your words known, amplify the utilit-y
I'm crooked like the 'I' on a toxic malt liquor
The Land whipper, the Dom Perignon champ sipper
The Fifth'll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
The Bad Lieu'll bring the bad weather
So to whoever got riff, let it rest, reflect
Then recollect on the way it was set
It's the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex
Be on the low, shotgun in the Lex
So with my man, low to flex
I’m restin' where they handle the TECs
And the lyrical vandal is next to flow, so
My man, my MZA, my man
M-ilitant, what’s the master plan?
Once again…
I came too far to front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo

Peep the oratory, niggas bore me with theatrics
Moms listen to they daughter story about my package
The adverse is on your table, stabilize emotion
A soldier at ease, but on post, the utmost and
Brag and boast in my anecdotes that choke
Invade your whole terrain, you feel the pain provoke
When I breaststroke your wavelength of intensity
My alliance bring forth to you an entity
Your whole vicinity, I contaminate with hate
Got no time to debate, but hold up, wait, sit straight
It’s M-Ill, the elicit, you violate, you get a ticket
MC's, you can't tell, I expel, you get evicted
From out your misery, serve your ass with my delivery
Allah makes the ground you steppin' on shivery
Permanent tears run through your thoughts, you queers
It's all upstairs, where there's a crowd, table and chairs
For years, been on the mic, I'm like a dyke with stares
When I strike, I stay severe, niggas, they lower their glare
From over here my Range Rover swear to blast off socks
Switch the pitch from southpaw to unorthodox
I shock your brain with the miscellaneous
Who beez the zaniest nigga with words that are spontaneous?
Ayo, the purpose mainly is to generate the Luther Van
Lyrical contraband, controllin' your command and...

You can't front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in ya section and throughout ya section
In ya area, throughout your whole section, yo

All the way live from 2-1-5, all the way live from the 6-1-0
Gettin' cash, get the gusto
One time, it's the dynasty flow
Runnin' it down the line, it's another
Yeah, you in tune to another ill Fifth Dynasty production, baby3Embed
