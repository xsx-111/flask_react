Panic!!!!! Lyrics
Yo, I woke up in the darkness at 12:17 to shots and sirens
Look out the window, peep the high beams
Now they searchin'
The cops lookin' for the person that pulled the trigger
Medical figures is nursin' the kid that got shot
Some innocent Akh that would front to flip the rock
On them at McKean Street block
I tried to tell him to stop 'cause yo, it's ghetto red hot
Similar to the blood now floodin' his top
I take a step out the spot, to the point of attack
And see the shorty-wop heart blast out of his back
Damn, I'm thinkin' it don't cease, it's no more peace
Police level increase, but what the fuck, it's still crime on the streets
I can't breathe, now what's goin' on?
One minute — you alive, the next — you're gone
Illadel-P-H-I-A Hell
Bust off into the heavens for the nigga who fell
And hit the L, for the niggas who fell
That could have been prevented
In front of the flat your moms rented
And no one expect that from you 'cause you was timid
Fuckin' with them cats from outside city limits
Funny how this whole thing changed, an off minute
Yo, dig it, Panic!!!!!
None of this is ever granted
Drownin' in a nightmare, stranded1Embed
