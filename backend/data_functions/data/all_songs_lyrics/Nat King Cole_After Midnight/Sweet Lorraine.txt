Sweet Lorraine Lyrics
Just found joy
I'm as happy as a baby boy
With another brand new choo-choo toy
When I met my sweet Lorraine, Lorraine, Lorraine
She's got a pair of eyes
That are brighter than the summer skies
When you see them, you'll realize
Why I love my sweet Lorraine

Now, when it's raining I don't miss the sun
Because it's in my baby's smile, oh
And to think that I'm the lucky one
That will lead her down the aisle, oh, oh

Each night I pray
That no one will steal her heart away
I can't wait until that lucky day
When I marry sweet Lorraine


Now, when it's raining I don't miss the sun
Because it's in my baby's smile, oh, oh
And to think that I'm the lucky one
That will lead her down the aisle, oh, oh
Each night I pray
That no one will steal her heart away
I can't wait until that lucky day
When I marry sweet Lorraine
