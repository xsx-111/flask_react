When I Grow Too Old to Dream Lyrics
When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart

So kiss me, my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart


So kiss, kiss me, my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
Your love will live in my heart
Your love will live in my heartEmbed
