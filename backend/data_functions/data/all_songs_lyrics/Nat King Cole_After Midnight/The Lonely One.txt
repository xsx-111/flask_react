The Lonely One Lyrics
There is a very quiet boy, they call the lonely one
There's sorrow in his face and sadness in his eyes
And if you look into the heart within the lonely one
You'll find it's been deceived by broken vows and lies

Is it good to have pride with a longing to hide
All your heartaches and fears?
Is it wise to be cold and to struggle to hold back the tears?
If you could only see the boy they call the lonely one
You'd know that since you're gone, the lonely one is me


Is it good to have pride with a longing to hide
All your heartaches and fears?
Is it wise to be cold and to struggle to hold back the tears?
If you could only see the boy they call the lonely one
You'd know that since you're gone, the lonely one is me

You'd know that since you're gone, the lonely one is meEmbed
