Just You, Just Me Lyrics
Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and woo
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you

Oh, gee
What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination

Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
Around wonderful you


Oh, gee
What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination
Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
Tie a lover's knot
Tie a lover's knot
Around wonderful youEmbed
