Two Trains Running LyricsWell, there's two trains running
But there's not one going my way
Yeah, when one runs at midnight
Are they just for a day
Are they just for a day
Are they just for a day
I went down to my baby's house
And I'd sat down on the steps
Said, "Come on in here, baby
My old man just left
He just now left
Oh, my old man left"
Yes, I wish I was a catfish
Swimming in the deep blue sea
And all you pretty women
Fishing after me
Fishing after me
Fishing after me
I went down to my baby's house
And I sat down on your steps
Said, "Come on in here, baby
My old man just left
He just now left
Oh, my old man left"
Well, she's long and she's tall
And she shakes like a willow tree
Say she's no good
She's alright with me
She's alright with me
She's alright with me
Oh, little girl's alright
Oh, yeah, she gives me loving
In the morning
Little girl, loving, baby
She's alright with me
She's alright
She's alright, uhEmbed
