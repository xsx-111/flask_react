Never Say No LyricsBaby, please, don't walk out on me
I will never hurt you
Someone else will really hurt you
Baby, please, don't walk out on me
And, honey, please, stop being so mean to me
You know that I love you
I done proved that I love you
Please, stop being so mean to me
I've given you my money, baby
And the loving too
I've done everything that a fool can do
To try and to keep you happy
And to satisfy I want you by my side
Baby, please, don't say no to me
'Til you've heard my story
'Cause you just might like my story
Baby, please, don't say no to me
Don't say no, baby
Baby, please, don't say no to meEmbed
