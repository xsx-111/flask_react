Get Out of My Life Woman LyricsGet out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more
I said, "Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more
Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more"
Get out my eyes teardrops, I got to see my way around
Won't you get out my eyes teardrops, I got to see my way around
Get out my life heartaches, nothing but heartaches by the pound
Get off my ladder woman, I got to climb up to the top
I said, "Get off my ladder woman, I got to climb up to the top
Get off my ladder woman, ladder's nothing to make you stop"
Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on
I said, "Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on
Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on"Embed
