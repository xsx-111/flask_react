Mary, Mary Lyrics
Mary, Mary, where are you goin' to?
And Mary, Mary, can I go there, too<
This one thing I will vow you
I'd rather die than and live without ya
Mary, Mary, where are you goin' to?

Mary, Mary, tell me truly
What did I do to make you leave me?
Whatever it was you know I didn't mean to
I never tried, a-tried to hurt you
Mary, Mary, where are you goin' to?

What more, Mary, can I do
To prove my love is truly yours?
I've done more than a clear-thinkin' man would do

Mary, Mary, it's not over
Wherever you go, child, I will follow
Until I win your love again
And stand beside you, until then
Mary, Mary, where are you goin' to?Embed
