Ladies and Gentlemen (Roll the Dice) Lyrics
I tell you something isn't right
The way I'm feeling kept me up all night
I fix myself another drink
This sounds crazy I need time to think
All the good one got away
All the good ones gone to waste
And I'll take another hit
Do I really keep my joint still lit?
All the TV's hypnotize
All the loonies on the rise
And oh man, well I gotta tell you...

Tonight, ladies and gentlemen
I roll the dice (tonight)
Just gimme that dice
It's been so hard working for no one
I roll the dice (tonight)
Just gimme that dice

Wakey, wakey rise and shine
Put down your souvenirs I feel it's time
We've been dead behind the eyes
Switching stations as our country dies
No matter what you do, you know the water keeps on turning
But we never feel a thing
C'mon and meet me at the carnival...

Tonight, ladies and gentlemen
I roll the dice (tonight)
Just gimme that dice
It's been so hard working for no one
I roll the dice (tonight)
Just gimme that dice
No matter what you do, you know the water keeps on turning
But we never feel a thingEmbed
