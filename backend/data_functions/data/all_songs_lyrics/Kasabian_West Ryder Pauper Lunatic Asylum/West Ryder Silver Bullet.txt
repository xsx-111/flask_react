West Ryder Silver Bullet Lyrics
Then I went down into the basement where my friend the maniac busies himself with his electronic graffiti. Finally, his language touches me because he talks to that part of us which insists on drawing profiles on prison walls. In that moment, poetry will be made by everyone and there will be emus in the zone

Mist covers the ground
In the city
Engine rumbles quiet as we drift by
I wish you could see
Through my crooked eye (Silence let me whisper)
Oh your beauty
Plays me just like a guitar string (It's so true)

I want your touch
Oh how I want you
Far too much
She's my baby
(He's my baby)

Days drift into one
It's so pretty
Traveling Wilburys police photofits
And this stolen car
Is loaded with junk (Silence let me whisper)
It's so dirty
You'll be the death of me
But that's okay
I want your touch
Oh how I want you
Far too much
She's my baby
(He's my baby)1Embed
