Cunny Grope Lane LyricsSomebody hold their hands out
'Cause my mind has gone
I'm walking through all the debris
'Cause my kite have gone
You can't get through
Prop up your eggs and bacon
With your silver spoon
I saw you play Old Medusa
In the dungeon room
You can't get through
You've got it on the brain!
Go pop your cherry down in  Grope Cunny Lane
Crowns! Shatter! King of Spain!
You'll lose your mind down in  Grope Cunny Lane
Go get the local doctor
And let's have some fun
I hope I avoid the paupers
On my prison run
Can I watch you?
Rank! Mother! City boy!
Dancing around and jumping for joy
Brother! T-shirt! King of Spain!
You'll lose your mind down in Grope Cunny LaneEmbed
