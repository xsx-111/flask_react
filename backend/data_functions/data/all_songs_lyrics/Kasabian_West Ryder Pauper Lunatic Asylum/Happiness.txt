Happiness Lyrics
I will follow you now
Wherever you go, I'll be with you now
Stick around forever and I...
Never wanna see those tears again, no no
When will you realize that I ain't that tough?

Save what you got
Keep it safe, don't ever stop
It's nothing more, it's nothing less
'Cus all we got is happiness
Is happiness... ain't that right?
Ain't that right?

And I will have a thousand dreams...
Of how I care for you, through these coloured streams
Look into the future and I...
Never wanna see those tears again, no no
When will you realize that you make me weak now?

Save what you got
Keep it safe, don't ever stop
It's nothing more, it's nothing less
'Cus all we got is happiness
Happiness! Oh, it's always been you
It's always been you

And I know you got to make it right
Hangin' out my feelings on these goods are too loud
And I've done my time, yeah I paid my dues
You know there's one thing that gets us together
It's gonna keep us together now, now, now, now!

Save what you got
Keep it safe, don't ever stop
It's nothing more, it's nothing less
'Cus all we got is happiness
Happiness!Embed
