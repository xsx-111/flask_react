Thick as Thieves Lyrics
There we were, thick as thieves
Frightened by shadows in the autumn leaves
We wore stolen hearts, vintage souls
Aided by lies amongst the meat eating foes

And hey ho, where did it go
When did we lose our sight
And it's a nice show
The ones we perform
Performing them day and night

See the lines upon my face
Walking in circles with the human race
And all the little people they want to be free
But I can't get there 'cause I got you holding me back

And hey ho, where did it go
When did we lose our sight
And it's a nice show
The ones we perform
Performing them day and night
Let me be free
I gave you all your scars but you gave me mine
I gave you all your scars but you gave me mine
I gave you all your scars but you gave me mine
I gave you all your scars but you gave me mine
Let the light sing again

There we were, thick as thieves
Frightened by shadows in the autumn leaves
Goodbye my sweet, goodbye
