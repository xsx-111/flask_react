Vlad the Impaler Lyrics
Face check I walk this beach
I'm frying in the heat in the cauldron stir me
Chomp down my diamond teeth I ain't got
The simple things in life I feel like
You have got to witness
This is your last retreat
My last repeat

All my friends are as sharp as razors
Cut you down if you touch the faders
High class girls hung in elevators
Now we have got the floor

Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
You can't miss me I'm still alive
Snake skin shoe-d, I'm pleading homicide
Come on and feel this I'm still alive
Joker meet you on the other side

Banshie I hear you call
We need to raise the dead, we need to raise the people
Cut throat this blood runs thick
It is true the simple things in life have been lost
You have got to witness
We are the last beatniks
The lost heretics
All my friends are as sharp as razors
Cut you down if you touch the faders
Listen up all you masqueraders
Now we have got the floor
Now we have got the floor

Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose (yeah)
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose (yeah)
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose (yeah)
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
You can't miss me I'm still alive
Snake skin shoe-d, I'm pleading homicide
Come on and feel this I'm still alive
Joker meet you on the other side
(This is your last...)
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
(This is your last...)
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose1Embed
