Secret Alphabets Lyrics
This is the end of the tracks
Where the fountains
Climb into your eye
Nobody's hurting and nobody's lying
They climb into your eye
Never to die

They say the man he used to sail on his journey
And laid a trap so much
The pilgrims for their money
He placed his gold all over this world
And in morning as he looked out over Cairo
He makes his process
And his smoked them in a barium
He could not die
And we never found out why

This is the end of the tracks
Where the fountains
Climb into your eye
Nobody's hurting and nobody's lying
They climb into your eye
Never to die
This is the end of the tracks
Where the fountains
Climb into your eye
Nobody's hurting and nobody's lying
They climb into your eye
Never to die
No one's getting older
Everybody's feeling young
Journey's almost over now
There's hope for everyone

This is the end of the tracks
Where the fountains close
(This is the end of time)
This is the end of the tracks
Where the fountains close
(This is the end of our life)Embed
