Fast Fuse Lyrics
Oh baby I was born
With a fast fuse
I've got no time to love
Just a city to abuse
Oh baby I was born
With a fast fuse
I've got no time to love
Just a city to abuse

Come get me
Wicked fines won't arrest me
I'm like Lucifer's child
Wild, acid done
Black sunglasses shade the morning sun
Come get me
All you fuckers can't touch me
I'm a hooligan crier, sire
Sit, don't scatter
It don't matter
Gimme one two three

Gold lightning in the skyline
Gold lightning in the sky
Oh baby I was born
With a fast fuse
I've got no time to love
Just a city to abuse
Oh baby I was born
With a fast fuse
I've got no time to love
Just a city to abuse

Vultures settle round
They wait above the ground
Oh, How dare you!
Not it's time to address you
I'm the reason you claim
Shame, stalk my name
See my fist chopping off your reign
It's getting hotter
Now I'm spitting out lava
Well I'm just putting it into words
Just genuine stock
Hear that bomb going tick tick tock

Gold lightning in the skyline
Gold lightning in the sky
Gold lightning in the skyline
Gold lightning in the sky
Oh baby I was born
With a fast fuse
I've got no time to love
Just a city to abuse
In the middle of the night
When they come for you
Where you gonna be?
What you gonna do?

Heaven may come
And heaven may call
But I won't be there
(Hey hey!)
Heaven may come
And heaven may call
But I won't be there
(Hey hey!)
Heaven may come
And heaven may call
But I won't be there
(Hey hey!)
Heaven may come
And heaven may call
But I won't be there
(Hey hey!)2Embed
