Road Kill Cafe LyricsMaking my snacks at the Road Kill Café
Combing my hair with skeleton bone
Cover my shoes and they taste like honey
Cover my scent to the spider and the fly
Cover my scent 'cause spider don't try
Living by the rhythm at the Road Kill Café
You can run for president, straighten up your tie
Open your mind, it'll make you happy
Polish of your booze with potatoes and a pie
A jackknife rabbit just swoop me in the eye
I just want to spend time with you
I just want to spend all my time with you
And if I want you to fight I'll leave
I just wanna see you, I like seeing you
Calling all the freaks to the Road Kill Café
You can leave your babies with your rides by the door
Look at your suit, man, you dress so snappy
Sharpen your machete on a hoodoo drum
Feeding your spaghetti through the barrel of a gun
Feeding your spaghetti through the barrel of a gun
Calling all the freaks to the Road Kill Café
Calling all the freaks to the Road Kill Café
Calling all the freaks to the Road Kill Café
Calling all the freaks to the Road Kill CaféEmbed
