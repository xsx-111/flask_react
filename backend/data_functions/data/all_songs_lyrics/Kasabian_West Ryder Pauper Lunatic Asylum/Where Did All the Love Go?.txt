Where Did All the Love Go? Lyrics
Ever took a punch
In the ribcage sonny?
Never met a soul
Who had no shrine
Keep this all in your mind
And get it inside my window
What do we become
Trying to kill each other?
You're faking it son
Gonna get you tonight
I suck another breath
To the hearts of the Revolution
Cause you still ain't right

Where did all the love go?
I don't know, I don't know
I bet you can't see it
Where did all the love go?
I don't know, I don't know
I bet you can't see it

Can't see the signs
Of a real change a commin'
Take another sip
From this hobo's wine
Get yourself a million miles
From this concrete jungle
This is a time
Full of fear full of anger
A hero's exchange for a telephone line
Whatever happened to the
Youth of this generation?
Cause you still ain't right
Where did all the love go?
I don't know, I don't know
I bet you can't see it
Where did all the love go?
I don't know, I don't know
I bet you can't see it

The rivers of the pavement
Are flowing now with blood
The children of the future
Are drowning in the flood

Where did all the love go?
Now I don't know why
I don't know why

In this social chaos
There's violence in the air
Gotta keep your wits about you
Be careful not to stare

Where did all the love go?
I don't know, I don't know
I bet you can't see it
Where did all the love go?
I don't know, I don't know
I bet you can't see it1Embed
