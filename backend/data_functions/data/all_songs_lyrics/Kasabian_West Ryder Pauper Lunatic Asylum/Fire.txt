Fire Lyrics
Take me into the night
I'm an easy lover
Take me into the fight
I'm an easy brother
I'm on fire

Burn my sweet effigy
I'm a road runner
Spill my guts on a wheel
I wanna taste, uh-huh
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

And I'm on fire
I'm going
You tell me
I feel it, I say
I'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn
And I'm on fire
I'm coming, You coming
No hiding my feeling
I wanna take it to the highest over me, yeah
Wire me up to machines
I'll be your prisoner
Find it hard to believe
You are my murderer
I'm on fire
Look behind you, there's the falling sky

And I'm on fire
I'm going
You tell me
I feel it, I say
I'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn

And I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Move on
You got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on
Move on
You got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on
I feel it, I want it
I'm coming, I tell ya
I caught the bullet from the heavens to the one you serve
I'm going
I'm running
Out to the highest love
I'm wanna hit you to the hip
I'm on fire
Move on
You got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on
I'm on fire
Move on
You got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on7Embed
