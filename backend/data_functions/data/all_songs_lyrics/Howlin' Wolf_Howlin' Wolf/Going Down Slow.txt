Going Down Slow LyricsMan, you know I done enjoyed things
That Kings and Queens will never have
In fact, Kings and Queens can never get
And they don't even know about it and good times?
I have had my fun
If I'd never get well no more
I have had my fun
If I never get well no more
Oh, my health is fadin', oh
Oh yes, I'm goin' down slow
Now looky here, I did not say I was a millionaire
But I said I have spent more money than a millionaire
'Cause if I had kept all of the money I done already spent
I would've been a millionaire, a long time ago
And women? Great googly moogly
Please write my mama
Tell her the shape I'm in
Please write my mother
Tell her the shape I'm in
Tell her to pray for me
Forgive me for my sins1Embed
