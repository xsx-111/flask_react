Down In The Bottom LyricsWell now, baby meet me in the bottom
Bring me my running shoes
Well now, baby meet me in the bottom
Bring me my running shoes
Well, I'll come out the window
I won't have time to lose
When you see me streaking by
Please don't be late
When you see me streaking by
Please don't be late
Well, when you see me moving
Though my life is at stake
Well, I hope you'll see me
When I come streaking by
Well, I hope you'll see me
When I come streaking by
She got a bad old man
You know I'm too young to die
Oh, I got to leave here
Get caught in there
I got to come out and run now
No I ain't gonna do it no more, misterEmbed
