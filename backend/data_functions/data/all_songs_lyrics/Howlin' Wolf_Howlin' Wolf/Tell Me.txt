Tell Me LyricsTell me, what in the world can be wrong
Tell me, what in the world can be wrong
Woke up this morning, trouble knocking on my door
I wonder what the trouble, big trouble at my door
I wonder what the trouble, real trouble's at my door
Thursday morning, my baby's making
Don't want me no more
I'll have to forget it and let this trouble pass
I'll have to forget it and let this trouble pass
Well, I wonder sometimes, how long my trouble gonna last
All night long, somebody knocking on my door
All night long, somebody knocking on my door
There ain't nothing but my troubles, can't be worried here no more
Oh, goodbye, goodbye baby, got to go
Oh, goodbye, goodbye baby, got to go
I can't lay around here, be worried with this trouble no more
Trouble is knocking
Trouble is knocking
Trouble is knocking
Trouble is knockingEmbed
