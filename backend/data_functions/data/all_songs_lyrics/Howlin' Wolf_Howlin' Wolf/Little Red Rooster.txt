Little Red Rooster Lyrics

Well, I have a little red rooster too lazy to crow 'fore day
Well, I have a little red rooster too lazy to crow 'fore day
Keep everything in the barnyard upset in every way

Oh, the dogs begin to bark, hound begin to howl
Oh, the dogs begin to bark, hound begin to howl
Oh, watch out, strange kin people
'Cause the little red rooster's on the prowl

Yeah, if you see my little red rooster, please drive him home
Yeah, if you see my little red rooster, please drive him home
There ain't no peace in the barnyard since the little red rooster been gone1Embed
