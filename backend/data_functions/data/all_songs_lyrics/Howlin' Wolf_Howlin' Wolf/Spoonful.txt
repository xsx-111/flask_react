Spoonful Lyrics
It could be a spoonful of diamond
It could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Satisfy my soul

Men lies about little
Some of them cries about little
Some of them dies about littles
Everything fight about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that

It could be a spoonful of coffee
Could be a spoonful of tea
But a little spoon of your precious love
Good enough for me

Men lies about that
Some of them dies about that
Some of them cries about that
But everything fight about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that ...
It could be a spoonful of water
Save you from the desert sand
But one spoon of lead from 45
Save you from another man

Men lies about that
Some of them cries about that
Some of them dies about that
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that ...3Embed
