Shake for Me Lyrics
Sure look good
But it don't mean a thing to me
Sure look good
But it don't mean a thing to me
I got a hip-shaking woman
Shake like a willow tree

You better wait, baby
You got back a little too late
You better wait, baby
You got back a little too late
I got a cool-shaking baby
Shake like jello on a plate


When my baby walk
You know she's fine and mellow
When my baby walk
You know she's fine and mellow
Every time she stops
Her flesh it shake like jello
Oh, shake it, baby, shake it for me
Oh, shake, lil' baby, shake it for me
Oh, shake it, little baby, shake it like a willow tree
The way you shake itEmbed
