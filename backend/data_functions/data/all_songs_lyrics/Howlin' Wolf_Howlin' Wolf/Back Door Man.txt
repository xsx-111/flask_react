Back Door Man LyricsI am a back door man
I am a back door man
Well the men don't know, but the little girls understand
When everybody's tryin' to sleep
I'm somewhere making my midnight creep
Every morning, when the rooster crow
Something tell me, I got to go
I am a back door man
I am a back door man
Well the men don't know, but little girls understand
They take me to the doctor, shot full o' holes
Nurse cried, please save the soul
Killed him for murder, first degree
Judge's wife cried, let the man go free
I am a back door man
I am a back door man
Well the, men don't know, but little girls understand
Stand out there
Cop's wife cried, don't take him down
Rather be dead, six feets in the ground
When you come home you can eat pork and beans
I eats mo' chicken, any man seen
I am a back door man
I am a back door man4Embed
