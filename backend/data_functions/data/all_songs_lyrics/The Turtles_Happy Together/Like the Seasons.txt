Like the Seasons LyricsI have learned
That love can turn
Like the seasons
And I know
You had to go
You've got your reasons
Still, I wish you'd stay
Tell me why you're going away
It hurts me not knowing
And I believe
That love's like leaves
In September
But Fall
And all
I do is remember
Still, I wish you'd stay
Tell me why you're going away
It hurts me not knowing
How I have wronged you
Oh, how I long to hold you again
Like summer never ended
But winter must fall
And I will give all
Of my love to someone new
For summer must follow too
And you and I have learned
That love can turn
Like the seasons
And I know
You had to go
You've got your reasons
Still, I wish you'd stayEmbed
