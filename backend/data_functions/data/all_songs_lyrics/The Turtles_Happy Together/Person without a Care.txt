Person without a Care LyricsI know people who envy the man
Who never complains
Who never gets mad
Who always seem so happy that
Nothing can get him down
They say when a man keeps his feelings inside
And puts on a show with a smile so wide
That everyone thinks he has nothing to hide
He should see
That it's hard to be a happy-go-lucky
Person without a care
It's hard to be a happy-go-lucky
Person without a care
When I love my girl and she loves me
We have everything like we want it to be
And as long as we're so happy
Nothing can get me down
Yes, I'll always be a happy-go-lucky
Person without a care
I'll always be a happy-go-lucky
Person without a care
People envy our lives and they know us well
We have hangups, but no one can tell
It may be corny, but I hear wedding bells
And I know I'll be a happy-go-lucky
Person without a care
I know I'll be a happy-go-lucky
Person without a care
Person without a care
Person without a careEmbed
