Me About You LyricsPerhaps another time or maybe another place
Could've eased my mind, would've never seen your face
Or heard about you
But now you call my name and you're reality
Though it's hard to explain, I know I'll never be
Without you
I know nothing about you
But I know I don't doubt your love and I know that it's real
By God above I know how I feel
About you
Got a handful of gold and a pocketful of dreams
But a heart full of love and I know what it means
To be without you
Please sit by my side and share with me
All the feelings inside and the things that you see
About you
I'd always known you'd be here today
Waiting for me; now the time is right, so you'll hear me say
That for all my life I will always stay
About you
I'd always known you'd be here today
Waiting for me; now the time is right, so you'll hear me say
That for all my life I will always stay
About you
About you
