Rugs of Woods & Flowers LyricsI've got to prove
That I can use
All the strength God gave me as a man
To make for you
A good life, too
And I'll die to prove that I can
To show I'm a man
Please give me a chance
I have always been the kind of guy who traveled with a storm behind him
All the good things in my life seem so damn small it takes so far to find them
I'll unwind them
I envy them
But strong I'll stay
Come what may
Through this seething hell of a world
For the love of you, girl
And we'll make our own world
So strong I'll stay
Come what may
Through this rat race hell of a world
And strong I'll stay
To hope and pray
To find my way
Or die
Or die
Or die
(Bravo! Bravo!)
(Bravo!)
(Oh, that was so much fun, I want to do it again)
Ah, no! No, no, no! I only do one performance
Only one encore, please, ahEmbed
