The Walking Song LyricsBacon fried, squinty-eyed, moments of the dawn
Misty street callin' me, "Get dressed and walk around"
In the square, standing there girl so sad
"What's the matter"?
She said
"Oh, oh dear sir, the world has got me down
And folks preach happiness when there's none to be found
I type and answer phones to earn my meager pay
To keep me alive so I can waste another day"
I sadly turned and walked away
For there was nothing I could say
Walking on, noonday sun, dusty road to town
Saddened by the girl that I had chanced to come upon
Then, I'd seen a limousine
A rich old guy, mean of eye
He said
"Oh, bah humbug, you can't understand
The world is one big bank, you must steal what you can
Because it's fools like you who waste their precious time
By walking in the sun instead of trying to make a dime"
The words he spoke turned my world grey
Could everybody feel this way?
As if in answer down the road
A lovely girl picked flowers of gold
She smiled sweetly and gave one to me
And said
"Please, kind sir, don't look so down
For in this hard world (OK) love still abounds
And hand in hand friends of beauty can lie
On clover beds 'neath a blanket of sky"
Oh, oh dear sir, the world has got me down
(Oh, bah humbug, you can't understand)
And folks preach happiness when there's none to be found
(The world is one big bank, you must steal what you can)
I type and answer phones to earn my meager pay
(Because it's fools like you who waste their precious time)
To keep me alive so I can waste another day
(By walking in the sun instead of trying to make a dime)
"How are you? How are you? How are you?"
"Hi, how are you?"Embed
