Too Young to Be One LyricsThere's something that I just can't seem to
Get off my mind, and it's this, girl
We've let it go too far
We're too young to have tied ourselves to
Each other's arms
We've forgotten who we are
I loved her
The two of us were one plus one
One together, but I found
That two could not stay one
Stay one forever
There's something that I just can't seem to
Get off my mind, and it's this, girl
We've let it go too far
We're too young to have tied ourselves to
Each other's arms
We've forgotten who we are
There's something that I just can't seem to
Get off my mind, and it's this, girl
We've let it go too far
We're too young to have tied ourselves to
Each other's minds
We've forgotten who we are
We've forgotten who we are
We've forgotten who we are
(Too young to have tied ourselves)
(We're too young to have tied ourselves)
(Too young to have tied ourselves)
(We're too young to have tied ourselves)
(Too young to have tied ourselves)
(We're too young to have tied ourselves)
(Too young to have tied ourselves)
(We're too young to have tied ourselves)Embed
