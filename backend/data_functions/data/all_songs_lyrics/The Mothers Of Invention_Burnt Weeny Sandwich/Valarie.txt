Although you don't want me no more
Oh, but it's alright, alright with me
'Cause you know, you're gonna want me someday
Yes, you will want me and I'll run away
Oh, Valarie (Valarie)
Valarie (Valarie)
Valarie
Don't you want me?
Don't you need me?
Valarie (ooh)
Valarie (ooh)
Valarie
Valarie (ooh)
Although you don't want me no more
Oh, but it's alright, it's alright with me
'Cause you know, you're gonna want me someday
Oh, you will want me and I'll run away
Oh, Valarie
Valarie
