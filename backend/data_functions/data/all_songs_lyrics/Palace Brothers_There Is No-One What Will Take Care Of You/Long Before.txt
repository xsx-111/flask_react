Long Before LyricsLong before what is black was blackened
O, long before
Blooms of gray made mother lovely
Mother ain't lovely no more
And long before the house was leaning
O, long before
The corridor of box woods lined the entrance
Box woods ain't there no more
Dad burned the box woods
And liked to burned the house
But one came wandering and beat daddy down
O, long before
Long before this road seemed knotted
O, long before
There was but one path, dim and cozy
Path don't seem to be no more
And long before you were my sister
O, long before
Gals in town, they called me mister
Ain't no girl call on me no more
I cut the card loosewise
Were you not my only dream?
Give the hero his house
He and Ma live in sin
O, long before
And long before you were an artwork
O, long before
Mama suckled you on her holy breast
Mama's breast ain't holy no more
Long before we shared a shortsheet
O, long before
I stood above you as you slept
I don't stand above no more
We've one little mobile
And one filthy path
And will drift along tongueless
Unhappiness at last
Will last
And last
Till we see fit to stand before
That virgin cunt, that sainted whore
Whose piss we have slept under
Whose smell we have bore
Is her heelprint that marks our faces?
O, long beforeEmbed
