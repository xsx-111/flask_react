O Paul LyricsO Paul
I know you feel disoriented tonight
But Paul
I hope you know that we're all here
And we won't let your sleep upset you tonight
And Paul
Stay tight upon the couch
With blankets close around your shoulders
So Paul
There won't be cause for you to stir
My Paul
There's something in your stomach turning sour
What happens in your head tonight's not true
You may get cold, you may wake up
And know that we're not right by
But Paul
We all must sleep, so go to sleep, goodbyeEmbed
