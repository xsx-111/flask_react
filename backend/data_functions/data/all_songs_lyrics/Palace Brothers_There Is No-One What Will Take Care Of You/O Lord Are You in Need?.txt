O Lord Are You in Need? LyricsWhen he calls on me tonight
Will I rise and have to greet him
O Lord are you in need?
He'll ask of me to think
Of some grounds on which to meet him
O Lord are you in need?
The porch across the street
Is cold and dark and empty
O Lord are you in need?
The window to the left
Holds warmth and light to tempt me
O Lord are you in need?
Can one man I admire
Ask kneeling for my kindness
O Lord are you in need?
This seamlessness I granted
Was that due to my blindness?
O Lord are you in need?
Your face seems hardly that
Which I've pined for in the mirror
O Lord are you in need?
Nor the visage I held up
To support me in life's furor
O Lord can you be in need?Embed
