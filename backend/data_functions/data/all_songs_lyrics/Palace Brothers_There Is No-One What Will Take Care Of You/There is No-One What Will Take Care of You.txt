There is No-One What Will Take Care of You LyricsBeneath a flow of water
You'll find yourself angling
You'll find the homewalk wettly
To spoil, you'll leave the days catch
While you drift off to sleep
Hey, my baby, don't drift away
Not on a sorry stow, old pal of mine
Don't let eyebrows settle permanently
Unfrowed with affection
Unafflicted by drama, what new can I say?
For the magic of my appearance does not exist, you know
For the sake of somebody, you must rhyme
And rhyme the rhyme we so despise
And through this task, the banal gleaning
Cast not a thought to your day of weaning
A bosom heart's while still ??
Mother sky is one of many for your heart
And the walls, the very walls which hinder vision
And as windows on the skill
To fish which is your artEmbed
