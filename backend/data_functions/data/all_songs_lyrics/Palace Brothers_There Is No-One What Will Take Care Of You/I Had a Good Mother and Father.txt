I Had a Good Mother and Father LyricsI used to have a real good mother and a father
And they certainly stood the test
Now they are in Thy glory
And I hope their souls at rest
They laid a good example for me
They taught me how to pray
Now I'm truly converted
And I'm walking in the narrow way
I'm so glad salvation is free
It is free for you and me
Now if we could only live with Jesus
How happy we would be
I know this whole round world
Does not love me nohow
And it's on account of sin
But I just thank God he's able
For to give me many friendsEmbed
