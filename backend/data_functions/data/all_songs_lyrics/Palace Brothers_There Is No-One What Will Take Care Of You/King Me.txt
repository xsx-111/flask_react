King Me Lyrics
I can't hear it play fast no more
Paces proxy for my patience
Keep our eyelids at half-mast
Watch our friends wander through

And king me, baby
King me, baby

I'm no fan of you most of the time
I'd just as soon be alone, you know
In fact I'd rather be on my own
Wading in my own ebb

So king me, baby
Please king me, baby
King me, baby
King me, baby

Sometimes it's your smell what gets me ill
Sometimes it's your blushing laugh
When that blah blah curdles my blood
I figure you're just one big inherent mistake
Yes, you have pulled my manhood into your corner
If I could get up enough strength, enough will
To pull to your side, I want you to reach into your reserves
Top me off, tide me over, make me a man

And king me, baby
Please king me, baby
King me, baby
King me, babyEmbed
