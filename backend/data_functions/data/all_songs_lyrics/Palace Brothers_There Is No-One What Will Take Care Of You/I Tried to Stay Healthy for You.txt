I Tried to Stay Healthy for You LyricsI tried to stay healthy for you
I stayed at cane's length from peril
But lonely threads constrict my heart
As you perch on that barrel
Sing to them all and I'll stand by
Though jealousy, it threatens
Smoke surrounds my blackened lungs
It is my only weapon
I hate these bags beneath my eyes
I know when your song's over
You'll come back to this bed of ours
And be my only lover
The carnal thoughts, they are beyond us
A man I am but only
To be your faithful other half
That neither one be lonely
Cold and old and here today
Our faces melt together
I would I had the means to make
Our persons one together
We are you and me and so it isEmbed
