Riding LyricsWhere you going riding, boy?
I'm gonna ride on down to see you
Where you going riding, boy?
I'm gonna ride on down to see you
Where you going riding, boy?
All dressed up and with that look of joy
Where you going riding, boy?
I'm gonna ride on down to see you
Who you gonna ride with, boy?
I'm gonna bring my sister Lisa
Who you gonna ride with, boy?
I'm gonna bring my sister Lisa
Who you gonna ride with, boy?
All dressed up and with that look of joy
Who you gonna ride with, boy?
I'm gonna bring my sister Lisa
Because I love my sister Lisa
I love my sister Lisa
I love my sister Lisa most of all
Don't you know that that's sinful, boy
God is what I make of Him
Don't you know that that's sinful, boy
God is what I make of Him
I'm long since dead and I live in Hell
She's the only girl that I love well
We were raised together and together we fell
God is what I make of Him
And all I have I give to Him
All I own I owe to Him
All my life I pledge to HimEmbed
