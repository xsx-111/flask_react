Solar Fire LyricsSee the morning dancer crossing the sky
Turning gold to amber travelling by
He must know the answer, he must know why
Looking for an answer, look to the sky
Shadows getting shorter, filling your sight
Brightly burning starfire, life giving light
Dawning into morning, day into night
Looking for an answer, look to the light
Sunlight streaming burn through the night
First light stealing shine solar fire
Starting from tomorrow look to the sky
There's a new day dawning passing you by
Follow on life's dance and then you'll know why
Looking for an answer, look to the sky
See the morning dancer crossing the sky
Turning gold to amber travelling by
He must know the answer, he must know why
Looking for an answer, look to the sky
Starting from tomorrow look to the sky
There's a new day dawning passing you by
Follow on life's dance and then you'll know why
Looking for an answer, look to the skyEmbed
