Father of Day, Father of Night LyricsFather of night, father of day
Father who taketh the darkness away
Father who teacheth the bird to fly
Builder of rainbows up in the sky
Father of day, father of night
Father of black, father of white
Father who builds the mountain so high
Who shapeth the clouds up in the sky
Father of loneliness and pain
Father of night, father of day
Father of grain, father of wheat
Father of cold and father of heat
Father of air, father of trees
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories
Father of night, father of day
Father who taketh the darkness away
Father who teacheth the bird to fly
Builder of rainbows up in the sky
Father of loneliness and pain
Father of night, father of day
Father of night and father of day
Father who taketh the darkness away
Father of black and father of white
Father who turneth the rivers and streams
Father of night, father of day
Father who taketh the darkness away
Father who teacheth the bird to fly
Builder of rainbows up in the sky
Father of grain, father of wheat
Father of cold and father of heat
Father of minutes, father of days
Father of whom we most solemnly praise
Father of loneliness and pain
Father of night, father of day1Embed
