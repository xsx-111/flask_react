In the Beginning, Darkness LyricsDarkness, darkness
Darkness in the Beginning
Solar light, warm as ice
Started everything living
Lightning striking
Every life springs from light
From the waters come swimming
Sunfire
Sunfire
Silence
Silence in the beginning
Silent sound fills the ground
All the oceans are singing
Thunder roaring
Came the word, something stirred
Set the wheel of life spinning
Sunfire
Sunfire
Darkness, darkness
Darkness in the Beginning
Solar light, warm as ice
Started everything living
Lightning striking
Every life springs from light
From the waters come swimming
Sunfire
