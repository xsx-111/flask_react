Earth, the Circle Part 1 LyricsCircle who beneath my feet
Also stand right above my head
Holding life in your hands so easily
O Circle you are our lives
Circle you contain the flame
And hold it deep inside
You who gave us the air and life we breathe
O Circle you are our time
Circle you are where we walk
And you are where we lie
And the colour we hear and sound we see
O Circle you are our eyesEmbed
