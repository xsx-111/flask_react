Naked Burn Lyrics
Angels dancing with a mortal, a sin
A giant born within a woman's womb
Nephilim walking through the forest, breaking limbs
As we bow and give respect to the gods

Save yourself
Don't wait on me

My feet are sewn
Endless bottom

The church is burning from the inside out
Altars falling into ashes again
An eagle flies upon horizons with sight
Focusing on all our family and friends

Apologize
Can we rise above it
Climb the line
It's a good endeavor
The ships arrived
Let's sail into the weather
Our crying eyes
