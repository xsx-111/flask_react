Thank You for This / We Built This Come Death (Live) Lyrics
Let's throw down the love
I catch eyes open far and wide
Ability
It's intense
Golden
Lace it fills the magic flies
I wonder where is this list

Give in next time
This will be a blast
Ability
It's intense
Golden
Lace it fills the magic flies
I wonder where is this list

Now you see all this time
Work nine to five
Monday through Friday I'm singing
I sing the blues for you
Now I'm standing in the pouring rain
My feet are cold but I can't complain
And I wonder how you have been
I need you love, I miss you so

I know it's right but it's always strange
How I scream, all this life's worth all the while
Heartache and slave driving pain
I sing the blues for you

Now I'm standing in the pouring rain
My feet are cold but I can't complain
And I wonder how you have been
I need you love, I miss you so
I know it's right but it's always strangeEmbed
