Island Lyrics
Given decision to live, not taken
The flight towards the light
I'll stay in the lava for life
Erupting when gods take us all
Changing the peaks makes us pour
From the mountain and burn
The path of our time

Hail people of Iceland
Journey of a land anew
Ram as our liaison
Vision inspire and move

Awe, holy island
Breed the lagoon to run free
Raw beauty is ruthless
Within the golden ring

Precision of Grungir
Spear of the Norse god Odin
Praise our pagan father
Founder of the Althing
Given decision to live, not taken
The flight towards the light
I'll stay in the lava for life
Erupting when gods take us all
Changing the peaks makes us pour
From the mountain and burn
The path of our time

Ruler of sky's thunder
The honorable warrior
All divination
Beware the hammer of Thor

Lava goddess, ice and fire, settling down
Ocean geyser, Gullfoss, Heimaey '73Embed
