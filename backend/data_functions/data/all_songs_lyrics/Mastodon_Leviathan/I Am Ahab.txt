I Am Ahab Lyrics
There's magic in water
That attracts all men, all men
Across hills and down streams
The turning of the tide
Outlook: Future bright
Selfish beauty shines
(Light cloud, rain drive on)
Thirteen years to this day, red planet aligned
Into sight 60,000 years of light
Fascination with a mountain put to sea
Built to slay and conquer all with teeth of beastsEmbed
