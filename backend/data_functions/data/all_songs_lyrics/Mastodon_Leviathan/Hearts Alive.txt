Hearts Alive Lyrics
Taken down
With hearts alive
Our hearts alive

Lurking dark underground
Descend to bottom
Swim below eternally
Into the deep blue sea

Time and space all alone
It can be a lonely place
There it goes, opening up
I can't stand, I can't breathe

Rolled fin out
Oil stripped
Hold is filled

Ocean coil, water boils
He swims to the surface
Flame from mouth, smoke he breathes
Enter the caverns of the deep
Time and space all alone
It can be a lonely place
There it goes, open up
I can't stand, I can't breathe

Terrified, ghastly cry
Spiraled lives
Taken down, taken down

The iron side
Bucket of lead
Battle is she
Not for defeat

The iron side
Bucket of lead
Battle is she1Embed
