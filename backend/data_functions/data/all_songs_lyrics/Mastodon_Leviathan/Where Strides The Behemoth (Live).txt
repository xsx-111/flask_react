Where Strides The Behemoth (Live) LyricsCondition tomorrow
With visions inlaid
The priest stands to our right
A princess is mine
The regress of some minds
Further chase the prize
Pretentious you follow
Religion is mine
Anger precedes my footsteps
Haunting past comes into head
Horizon seems so far away
This life close to end of days
Kill and i will be damned
Forgive and i will be free
Unified eyesight
