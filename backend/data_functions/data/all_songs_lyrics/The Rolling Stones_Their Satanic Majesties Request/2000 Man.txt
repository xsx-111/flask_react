2000 Man Lyrics
Well, my name is a number, a piece of plastic film
And I'm growing funny flowers in my little window sill
Donâ€™t you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all

Well my wife still respects me, I really misused her
I am having an affair with the random computer
Don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all

Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun

Oh daddy, your brain's still flashing
Like it did when you were young
Or do you come down crashing
Seeing all the things you'd done
All was a big put on

Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun

And you know who's the 2000 man
And your kids they just won't understand you at allEmbed
