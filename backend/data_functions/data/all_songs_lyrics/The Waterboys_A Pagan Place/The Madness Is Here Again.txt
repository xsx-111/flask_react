The Madness Is Here Again LyricsI can't sleep
I can't get my breath
I can't stop talkin'
And I look like death
The madness, the madness
The madness is here again
My hands are tied
I'm nailed to the floor
I feel like I'm knockin'
On the unknown door
The madness, the madness
The madness is here again
Now the wrecker busts loose
He's swinging a chain
Shouting out something
That sounds like my name
The madness, the madness
The madness is here again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it coming?Embed
