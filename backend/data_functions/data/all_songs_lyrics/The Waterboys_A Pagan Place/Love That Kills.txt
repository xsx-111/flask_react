Love That Kills LyricsWill you take me slowly
Will you lead me all the way
Will you sing me your songs
Until I am ready for
The love that kills
Yeah!
I have known you in the
Sheets and folds of many lifetimes
You were there when I was made
And I will speak to you in the language of dream until
Love comes my way
Love that kills
Yeah!
Hey I will ride on a dolphin, rain in my face
Wind in all of my sails
There's a shadow hard on my heels now
But I'm still trying to, I'm still trying to...
Get to the place, where rolling rivers overspill
I have come a long way and I need my cup refilled
So when you come for me slowly
When you come knocking on my door
When the soul sings
And the man is still
I will be ready
I will be ready
Yes I will be ready for the love that kills
Yeah!
The love that kills
The love that kills, Kills, kills
The love that killsEmbed
