Lawdy Miss Clawdy Lyrics
Well, Lawdy, Lawdy, Lawdy miss Clawdy
Girl, you sure look good to me
But please don't excite me baby
I know it can't be me

'Cause I give you all of my money
Yeah, but you just won't treat me right
You like to ball every morning
Don't come home till late at night

I'm going to tell, tell my mama
Lord, I swear ,girl, what you've been doing to me
I'm going to tell everybody that I'm down in misery

So, bye, bye, bye, baby
Girl, I won't be coming no more
Goodbye, little darling, down the road I'll go
So, bye, bye, bye, baby
Girl, I won't be coming no more
Goodbye, little darling, down the road I'll go1Embed
