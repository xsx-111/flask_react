Nothingville Lyrics
Nothingville
Born in a two bit town
Where nothing's real
They treat me like a country clown in

Nothingville
I ain't gonna keep a-hanging 'round
While doors keep slamming in my face
People keep putting me in my place

It's a rat's race at a snail's pace
Nothingville, Nothingville
NothingvilleEmbed
