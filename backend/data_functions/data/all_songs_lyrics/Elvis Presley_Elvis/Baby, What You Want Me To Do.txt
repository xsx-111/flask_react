Baby, What You Want Me To Do Lyrics
We're going up, we're going down
We're going up, down, down, up
Any way you wanna let it roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me doin' what you want me
Oh, baby, what you want me to do

You got me peeping, you got me hiding
You got me peep, hide, hide, peep
Any way you wanna let it roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me doin' what you want me
Oh, baby, what you want me to doEmbed
