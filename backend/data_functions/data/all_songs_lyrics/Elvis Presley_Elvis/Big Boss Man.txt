Big Boss Man Lyrics
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Can't you hear me when I call?
Well you ain't so big, you know you just tall that's all, All right
Well you got me working, boss man
Working round the clock
I want to little drink of water
But you won't let big Al stop
Big boss man, now can't you hear me when I call? All right
I said you ain't so big, you know you just tall that's all

Big boss man, why can't you hear me when I call? All right
You know you ain't not so big, I said you just tall that's all, All right
I'm going to get me a boss man
The one who's going to treat me right
I work hard in the day time
Rest easy at night
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call? Can't you hear me when I call?
I said you ain't so big, you just tall that's all
I'm going to get me a boss man
One that's going to treat me right
I work hard in the evening
Rest easy at night
Big boss man, big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
I said you ain't so big, you just tall that's all
All right, big boss man
It's all rightEmbed
