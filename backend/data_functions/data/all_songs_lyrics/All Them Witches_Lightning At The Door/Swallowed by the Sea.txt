Swallowed by the Sea LyricsI feel you are a poison
Yes, I am poison too
I am so weary huntin'
Make my bed for lie down
What do you have for dinner
Eels boiled in broth for stew
I am so weary huntin'
Make my bed for lie down
What do you leave your brothers
My old goat and old ram
What do you leave your father
My gold watch and my land
What do you leave your sweetheart
The rope and high gallows tree
Let her swing there forever
For the poisonin' of meEmbed
