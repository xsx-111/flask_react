Charles William LyricsI wanna take you home
Mary
I wanna feel this
Porcelain
I'm gonna lift my head
God willing
I'm gonna raise the dead
For you
Jesus was my dad
Never laid a hand
Jesus was my dad
Never raised a hand
I wanna take you home
Mary
I wanna feel this
Porcelain
I'm gonna lift my head
I'm gonna raise the dead
For you
Jesus was my dad
Never laid a hand
Jesus was my dad
Never raised a hand
I wanna take you home
Mary
I wanna feel this
Porcelain
I'm gonna lift my head
God willing
I'm gonna raise the dead
For you
Jesus was my dad
Never laid a hand
Jesus was my dad
Never raised a hand

To the stone
I am so far from home
And I can no longer go with you
I have left my only son
And he is so all alone
Tell me
What is a grown man to do

To the stone
I am so far from home
And I can no longer go with you
I have left my only son
And he is so all alone
Tell me
What is a grown man to do1Embed
