When God Comes Back LyricsCut me up primitive I'll die like a slave
Riding on the wings of that Jesus snake
Ten thousand souls in your right hand
Never lost ground to no cold blooded man
Ten thousand souls in your right hand
Juggernaut child in a fragile land
Everything I see is just a part of it
Every word I breathe is just a part of it
I saw her drink from that cup of light
So I know she still exists
Cut me up primitive I'll die like a slave
Riding on the wings of that Jesus snake2Embed
