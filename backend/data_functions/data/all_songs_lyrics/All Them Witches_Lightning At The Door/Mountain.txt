Mountain LyricsFound all the things to eat
So you ate them
Stole all the tongues
From the mouths of the babes
Spent your life making swords
For the lonely
Crawled around in the woods
Cutting legs from the snakes
I'd sell my sisters
Gone off to the mountain side
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't want to find them
I just wanna live my life
God bless our mother, the mountain
She filled all the holes gathered in my eyes
I would walk forever
Just to know you
Give me a place
And I will bless these walls
Show me the beast
I should sing to
Blood with reason
Clenched in your jaws
I'd sell my sisters
Gone off to the mountain side
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't want to find them
I just wanna live my life
God bless our mother, the mountain
She filled all the holes gathered in my eyesEmbed
