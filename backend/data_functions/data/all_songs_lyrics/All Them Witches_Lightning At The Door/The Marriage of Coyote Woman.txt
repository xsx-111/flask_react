The Marriage of Coyote Woman LyricsI've never met a salesman like you before
Lines of the world just rippin' us apart
Scratch ran out along the way
Think I got one more word left to say
I've never met a salesman like you before
Lions of the world just rippin' us apart
Scratch ran out nice and slow
Think I got one more mile left to go
I thought nothing would ever pierce my heart
Worst thing to do is to shutter on my pride
Scratch ran out nice and slow
Think I got one more mile left to go
I've never met a salesman like you before
Lines of the world just rippin' us apart
Scratch ran out along the way
Think I got one more goddamn word to say2Embed
