Wop-A-Din-Din LyricsShe's got big green eyes
And a long Egyptian face
She moves across the floor
At her own pace
When I'm here in bed
She'll jump up on my chest
And when we lock eyes there's so much love
I wanna cry
She comes in near
When I scratch under her ear
And she lifts her head
When I kiss around her neck
Won't go to sleep
When she falls along my side
And two green eyes fade
To a porcelain marble white
And somehow when I sleep
She'll end up at my feet
And if I roll and kick her out
I might knock her to the ground
But she'll come back anyhow
Ella es mi hijita  (she's my little daughter)
Más dulce que las cerezas  (sweeter than cherries)
Pura como el agua  (pure as water)
Con la nariz y las orejas rosas  (pink nose and ears)
The morning comes
She squints up to shield out the sun
And she'll go and lay
In the warmest dusty rays
And I hold her face
She lays perfectly in place
And she'll yawn and stretch
And stare me down expressionless
And lay back down into her nest
And if someone calls
She'll race me out the hall
When she hears the phone
Then she knows I'm leaving home
She don't wanna be alone
And I know it's wrong
That I'm going away so long
And for her it's rough
I can't be with her enough
But I'll never give her up
Sus ojos brillan como el sol  (eyes shine like the sun)
La amo más que nadie  (i love her more than anything)
Con manchas de vaca  (with cow pattern skin)
Más suave que cochinita  (softer than a piglet)
And somehow when I sleep
She'll end up at my feet
And if I roll and kick her out
I might knock her to the ground
But she'll come back anyhowEmbed
