Byrd Joel LyricsMy baby sleeps in blue
Warm and naked pale and pretty
I feel the seventh wave
Of the ocean in the motion
I feel a brand new sickness
Coming over me like a storm
Used to feel so good beside her
There next to her my arm around her
She fell like flowers
Petals where carried out on my old wind
Landed down in the centre of this
Lonely white grip of winter
She brought these gifts of love
I carried down in my pocket
I set then on my shelves
And on the night stand by my bed
She sleeps and won't come back again
From pretty dreams that keep her
My baby won't back again
I feel so lost without her
I hear your magic voice on the
Analogue of this machine
I hear the smoothest talk of the
Coolest transparent star field
Will there be any danger if
Our talk is under this roof?
And can you know a stranger
So quickly under this moon?
So go away come back again
I'll shut you out I'll pull you in
Don't go away come back again
I feel so lost
She sleeps in royal blue
And the room down past the big dry desert
The sense of music there
And hope reaches you
And gets you past the motions of
Goodbyes .... (???)
And pulls the deepest winter out of this
Lonely white crippled winter
She sleeps and won't come back again
From pretty dreams that keep her
My baby won't come back again
I am so lost without her
So go away come back again
I shut you out I pull you in
Don't go away, come back again
I feel so lostEmbed
