Void LyricsFind another corner of the house
When you need to get away
Her guitar leans against the couch
Sometimes I pick it up and play
Loosen and stretch it's ancient strings
Until it sounds the way I feel
Brush my thumb against it soft
Give it life or give it pause
When you look up in my eyes
I'm looking down in yours
All looks good up in the sky
Down to your wooly carpet floor
And I know that I have picked
The most perfect sunflower yet
Even on a sketchy day
Just outside her Show-Me State
When all it's colours turn and dry
Will you live or will you die?
When all it's poets fall away
Will you go or will you stay?
Fill the void in me now
Making love to me girl
Red light cruising the night
Red light getting me home
Driving down the freeway in your truck
I watched the river flowing up
Headlights cutting through the night
Hear them pass this place in time
And I know that I have slept
In the warmest bedroom yet
Even on the coldest day
Here inside her Show-Me State
A verse of hope
There on that reel
Lets you know the way I feel
Wrap my fists up in your hair
Feel me cruise up in the air
Fill the void in me now
Making love to me girl
Red light cruising the night
Red light getting me home
Fill the void in me now
Making love to me girl
Red lights float in the night
Red lights getting me home
Fill the void in me now
Smile down on me girl
Red light cruising the night
Red lights getting me home
Fill the void in me now
Making love to me girl
Red lights float in the night
Red light getting me home
Pull the weight of me now
Wrapped around me so good
Red light cruising the night
Red lights getting me home
Pull the weight off me now
Wrapped around me so good
Red light cruising the night
Red light getting me home
Fill the void in me now
Making love to me girl
Red lights cruising the night
Red lights getting me homeEmbed
