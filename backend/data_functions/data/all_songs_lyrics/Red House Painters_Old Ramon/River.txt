River LyricsI know you're willing and able
There by the wooden table
Won't you come on over to my side?
And you know I'll treat you right
There at the water
There is the water you drink
Won't you come on over to my side?
And you can drink from my...
Down through the dirt you lead us
Across the sand you'll disappear
Will you come back?
I feel you won't need us
I feel you won't miss us
Will you come back?
Back in the summer
I fell into your space
With an understanding
When I just looked in your face
There at the water
You wash your skin
Sleep on the violets
Until you're covered in dust again
I know you're hungry and tired
All alone by the fire
Won't you come, come on over to my side?
And you know...
Down through the dirt you lead us
One kiss before you leave
Will you come back?
And sleep tonight beside me?
The morning comes I feel alive
Will you come back?
And two yellow eyes remember
Souls of ancient lies
And she sees them dance and hears them moan and cry
And two yellow eyes reveal
Warmth and love inside
And she wears her mask
Pulls on her gloves
And two yellow eyes remember
Souls of ancient lies
And she sees them dance and hears them moan and cry
And two yellow eyes reveal her
Warmth and love inside
And she wears her mask
Pulls on her gloveEmbed
