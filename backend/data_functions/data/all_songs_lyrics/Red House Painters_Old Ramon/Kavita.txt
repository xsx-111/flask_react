Kavita LyricsHello Kavita
When can I see her?
You know I've been lonely
And it's been hard
Hey there Kavita
Next time I see her
I won't be this desperate or be
Feeling so spent
And you're all I've got it's true
I don't care what they say about you
Kavita
Down in the lobby
Reading the weakly
Talking with Abraham
Because you know he's my main man
Who put you down
So far in the ground?
My friend calls you stupid but
I think you're cute
And you're all I got it's true
I don't care what they think about you
Kavita
And you're all I got it's true
I don't care what they say about you
Kavita
And you're all I got it's true
I don't care what they say about you
