Smokey Lyrics
I'm broken down, you caved my karma in
I'm staying up, waiting for you like a fool
You made me forget about all the dreams I kept
I keep your glass hand by the bed we slept

I can't erase your smokey eyes
Your smothered face, gripping on my waist
Leaving a ghost upon the Oregon Coast
And on the floors of a crashes porch

Who can pretend
That there's a beginning, and not an end?
It ain't contrived
All the magic in our lives
Comes down like a storm
Then drizzles then dies

Your soul is free, but you're the one I need
And you made your deal, but you're still my ideal
And so I wait, and so I choose this fate
And store your shape in my electric bed
Who can pretend
That there's a beginning without an end?
It ain't contrived
All the magic in our lives
Comes on like a storm
Then drizzles then diesEmbed
