Each Coming Night Lyrics
Will you say when I'm gone away
"My lover came to me and we'd lay"?
In rooms unfamiliar but until now, oh-oh-oh-oh
Until now, oh-oh-oh-oh
Until now

Will you say to them when I'm gone
"I loved your son for his sturdy arms"?
We both learned to cradle then live without, oh-oh-oh-oh
Live without, oh-oh-oh-oh
Live without

Will you say when I'm gone away
"Your father's body was judgement day"?
We both dove and rose to the riverside, oh-oh-oh-oh
Riverside, oh-oh-oh-oh
Riverside

Will you say to me when I'm gone
"Your face has faded but lingers on"?
'Cause light strikes a deal with each coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
