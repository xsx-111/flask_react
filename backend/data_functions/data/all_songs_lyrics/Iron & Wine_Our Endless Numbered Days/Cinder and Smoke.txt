Cinder and Smoke Lyrics
Give me your hand
The dog in the garden row is covered in mud
And dragging your mother's clothes
Cinder and smoke
The snake in the basement
Found the juniper shade
The farmhouse is burning down

Give me your hand
And take what you will tonight
I'll give it as fast
And high as the flame will rise
Cinder and smoke
Some whispers around the trees
The juniper bends
As if you were listening

Give me your hand
Your mother is drunk
As all the firemen shake
A photo from father's arms
Cinder and smoke
You asked me to pray for rain
With ash in your mouth
You'll ask it to burn again3Embed
