Free Until They Cut Me Down Lyrics
When the men take me to the devil tree
I will be free and shining like before
Papa, don't tell me what I should've done
She's the one, she's the one who begged me
"Take me, take me home"

When the wind wraps me like the reaper's hand
I will swing free until they cut me down
Papa, don't tell me what I could've done
She's the one, she's the one who begged me
"Take me, take me home"


When the sea takes me like my mother's arms
I will breathe free as any word of God
Papa, don't tell me what you would've done
She's the one, she's the one who begged me
"Take me, take me home"Embed
