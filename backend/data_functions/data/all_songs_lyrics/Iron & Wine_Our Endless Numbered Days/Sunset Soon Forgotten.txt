Sunset Soon Forgotten Lyrics
Be this sunset soon forgotten
Your brothers left here shaved and crazy
Weâ€™ve learned to hide our bottles in the well
And what's worth keeping, sun still sinking

Down and down
Once again
Down and down
Gone again

Be this sunset, one for keeping
This June bug street sings low and lovely
Those Band-Aid children chased your dog away
She runs, returning, sun still sinking

Down and down
Once again
Down and down
Gone again1Embed
