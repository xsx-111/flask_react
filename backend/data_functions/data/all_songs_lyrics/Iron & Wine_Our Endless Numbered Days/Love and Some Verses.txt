Love and Some Verses Lyrics
Love is a dress that you made long to hide your knees
Love to say this to your face, "I'll love you only"
For your days and excitement
What will you keep for to wear?

Someday drawing you different
May I be weaved in your hair?

Love and some verses you hear
Say what you can say
Love to say this in your ear, "I'll love you that way"
From your changing contentments
What will you choose for to share?

Someday drawing you different
May I be weaved in your hair?1Embed
