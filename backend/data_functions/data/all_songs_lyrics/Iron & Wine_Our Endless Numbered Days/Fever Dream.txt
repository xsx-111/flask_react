Fever Dream Lyrics
Some days, her shape in the doorway will speak to me
A bird's wing on the window
Sometimes I'll hear when she's sleeping
Her fever dream, a language on her face

I want your flowers like babies want God's love
Or maybe, as sure as tomorrow will come

Some days, like rain on the doorstep, she'll cover me
With grace in all she offers
Sometimes I'd like just to ask her what honest words
She can't afford to say, like

I want your flowers like babies want God's love
Or maybe, as sure as tomorrow will come2Embed
