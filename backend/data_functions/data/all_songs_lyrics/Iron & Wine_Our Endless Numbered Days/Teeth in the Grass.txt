Teeth in the Grass Lyrics
And when you give me your clothes
And when we're lovers at last
Fresh air, perfume in your nose

There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass

And when you give me your house
When we're all brothers at last
There will be food in our mouths

There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass

And when there's nothing to want
When we're all brilliant and fast
When all tomorrows are gone
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass1Embed
