Sodom, South Georgia Lyrics
Papa died smiling
Wide as the ring of a bell
Gone all star white
Small as a wish in a well
And Sodom, south Georgia
Woke like a tree full of bees
Buried in Christmas bows
And a blanket of weeds

Papa died Sunday and I understood
All dead white boys say, "God is good"
White tongues hang out, "God is good"

Papa died while my girl
Lady Edith was born
Both heads fell like
Eyes on a crack in the door
And Sodom, south Georgia
Slept on an acre of bones
Slept through Christmas
Slept like a bucket of snow

Papa died Sunday and I understood
All dead white boys say, "God is good"
White tongues hang out, "God is good"1Embed
