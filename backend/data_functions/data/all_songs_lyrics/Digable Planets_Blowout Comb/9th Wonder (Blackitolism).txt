9th Wonder (Blackitolism) LyricsAh yea
Whole world
MCs
Whose slick?
We lounge stay phat notice our G limp
A natural flair with our fresh-ass hair
Style baggy out, clout, slick
Creamy and fresh East Coast to West
Brooklyn, making money
Uptown, making money
To the Universal fam, making money
Old school MCs, making money

I'm slicker this year, I'm slicker this year
Myrtle Ave, A-train, got the pick in my hair
And what sixteen joints later still lounge
Fresh from Flatbush in my baggy booster Guess
Style is type ease, busted cami fatigues
50,000 leagues of Black, so what's up
Can we avenue slide player style ghetto walk
To the East son, wild Crooklyn, New York
Creamy kids yell Smith and Wesson when I'm blessing
The angular slang blow spots, bangâ€”eleven
Hanging like bats cause the twelve-inch wax
Say "Scorpio"
And my hair say 'fro
And my blood say 'bro
My clique say, "a-yo"
Make sparks from the barrel mental pistol
To the depths I dive seems lunar like aqua
The cool blast mega we black we wildflowers
Scott La Rock had 'em all
I gots to ball, and roll with little Panthers through these project halls
The three-color flag can't hold my baggy sag
7-1-8 to Omega
Black motion is ocean style
Slick in my ways since days of deep classics
Now glamor boys want to be triple phatted
But I'm slicker this year
I'm slicker this year
East born
Beats Tannoys on
Lovely, all over the city
In your tape deck blasting
7R's and the phat fly sneakers
And the camouflage

To the hip-hop nation, making money
To the mixtape crew, making money
To the West Coast, making money
To the Boogie Down Bronx, making money

I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
And five elements posture, take a B-boy stance
With the gold front shining, baggy pants sagging
This Brooklyn styling got the fly girls smiling
But I'm climbing, finding new ways of rhyming
Not living like a star, it's strictly bout surviving
Diving, deep into the grooves of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles
Yes the notorious, with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes so conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
Lyrical skills of the insect in motion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now I'm rolling with the seven and the crescents
Puffing some expression
Manifesting today's lessons
Stressing the fact that I'm solar guaranteed to go far
Cause the mind is interstellar
Still peace like that, so have no fear
But I'm slicker this year
I'm slicker this year
To the queens everywhere, making money
To the whole S.I, making money
To the lumpen mass, making money
Don't forget about your peeps when ya, making money

Now you see that I'm 68 inches above sea level
93 million miles above these devils
Play me in the winter
Play me in the summer
Play me in the autumn
Any order
You want em I got em, dripping like water
Catch me at a hot spot with the dusk daughters
We bouncing, moving within the true circles
We played you, made you change, straight New Yorked you
We stratify our wealth from my Luchi in the bank
There's love amongst the ranks
Now I'm about to beep my homegirl
Cause we be alike
A-alike, C-alike, yes G-alike
Jazzy Joyce, on the wheels
Jazzy Joyce, no one smoother
Jazzy Joyce, phatter than a '94 Land Cruiser
Where you from
The Bronx representing like whatever, pa
Cool, are you slicker this year
Yeah, watch6Embed
