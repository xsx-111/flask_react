Blowing Down Lyrics
We always roll down, no doubt
At the funky side of ten spots

Dash yeah, crystals how clear, I broke out
Pretenders bent out and ready to do my splendor
Move, move the smooth groover, dudes from the zoo
That play the mic like, wow
Walk with a cane, talk with the slang
Developed on Crooklyn blocks which I walk but
Our radius is the whole universe
Kiss yourself goodbye cause Amu know you no plush
Cheese dime, let me try her, gold smile
Fro in the pile, beep beeped my sun visor
She filled with sun visor, and Staten the third
Love, love, everyday, that’s my word
When I see your crew, I say "that’s them herbs"
Blam-blam, bloodclot and it just don’t stop
(Fresh) lush black (slick)
Right off the block (fat)
No doubt, we turns it out
Cause we keep black movement and castle keep rocking
Plus hang with my niggas and hit the dope spots
Play in the corners and maybe even boogie
Till the sun come up or a gun come up
Shooting at the breeze, the local MCs
Styling with ease, doing it like the sun is in here
Cause we bomb rhyme, saying, Butter ain’t playing
Blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out

Black on time been still laying like I said
Under the screen, be a eighth wonder
So for Dania, I do it, shit, push a little fist
Fit my one twenties, greet the avenue blue
Corner flying it into a forty, twenty
Brothers lay in a bottle, thirty fly right by, double time and shit
Next, I’m hitting, so I can step sooner
On the nova, so no water goes south
So see my G, yeah, she coming and we not a flesh vendor
Mecca got soul living so, living so
Shot open on my left just in time
No we finger pops it to a liter, when it’s cool
In a sense we smoother than oil's contents
Loyal to the kick drum like... flavor
Bounce, bounce, ease back, when we do it, fluid
Yes, nigga type fresh
Blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out
We always blow out (Without a doubt, without a doubt)
For the funky side of town, no doubt (Yes, yes, y’all, yes, yes, y’all)
We always blow out (Uh, check it out)
For the funky side of town, no doubt (Word)
We gets live-r than any eighty fiver
And the funk pots thicker out here in Brooklyn
Every crew's badder, we choose to rock fatter
Cause I stimulate...

Life and matter
When I spread my wings, I do's my things
Cause Doodle Bug wants to live like a Zulu king
So I swing with my crew to where the beats be fat
Swoon units by the pound and they natural black
Without a doubt, this is the place to be
I see baseball caps, hear beats by Warren G
I sinks into the mode of the cool out breeze
You know, the cool breeze rocks the beats wit ease
So nigga please, full of the dread poetic
The sun-moon sect in the house made to set it
With the peace signs, fat rhymes, the planet fix
Add Butter to the Mecc, then jet to eighty-six

Blowin' out, blowin' out
Blowin' out, blowin' out
Blowin' out, blowin' out
Blowin' out, blowin' out

You better blow that shit outEmbed
