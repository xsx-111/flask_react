For Corners Lyrics
Brooklyn got the funk
Uptown got the funk
East/West/Northside got the funk
L.A. got the funk
Boogie Down got the funk
Queens do got the funk
The bottom got the funk
We got the funk

I'm high as the wind so I blow minds
Curb hanger and hopper at the oracle of hipster
Just like Black Caesar my depths are fresh
'Cos you're a fish and I'm a water sign
My laid-back pimp walk is linear by design
Gold fronts soul I shotee now watch you shine
Me and C-Know makin' it a pundit
I'm glad to see my nigga he plush and lavish on the block

Cleaner than others in my form I resort on the corners
Connect with my propers
Cop my double players
Cleo still hittin' 'till 38's pump and they up it
Yell it and could never by defunk-ed
I'm totemed in the fashionable flyers
Unscared against the palest of 'em
Gem percents unheard since I'm the storm
Donned '69 power...
Blocks
You can check my stats I got crazy ups baby
C-Know got style don't play me like I'm lazy
Fadey but never will I go out
My cl-out is known across the crooklyn lands
My universal fans got stamina
Polar bears are fear when we step in the arena
360 C-Know simply cyclin'
Firm as a rock print the god when I'm buildin' blocks

Mecca she got the funk
She got the funk yeah
My man C-Knowledge got the funk
He got the funk yeah

From the 11217 I transmit
My area is thick my vision focused
My jitterbugs limp n' learn as I squirm
But I'm a team player so I waits my turn
And when I get the rock I'm going straight to the hole
My average per game is pure black soul
In the 13, X'd out the ignorance
Got the clearance to speak intelligence on the block
Into illusion we drown
By forth sounds smooth enough to break you left
Another pound as my conscience get they rest
That's right we Shaft it
Includes this pro strips as I shit, burnin', blowin'
Shakin' E-as-Allah
3 different bags of proof
Why won't you swallow it approach you one time, the clearest
Finer and sharper in the hour of black steel power...
Blocks

Son I'm divin'
I worm mork n'jeans high swarms
The nigga in the Cadillac so watch my spokes twist
Spread him out a pound you slide me to 126
My soul-zodiac stroll with G licks
My understanding Bill doses 7 to the 6
I pump a fist
Even my hand got an ego
Id and super-id
The kid is super kid
I doozey with the young Marx plus the 7ods on the B-Line

Butterfly got the funk
He got the funk yeah
Sulaiman got the funk
He got the funk yeah
Ay yo here's the man
The true mastermind born n' planned
Talents skills none can withstand
So kill the sham as I speak techniques mad deep
To represent for the streets the city corners
Leave 'em hot as a sauna
Word is bond cause Sul the steps be on
The true original man sunset to rise with foes and those you probably
Recognized on the block

I play my Jeff tilted cause I got shtyle
Like every nigga on the corner stroll with brown boots
This is our block and we do be tripping
Ringin' round the ave like sata at mad volume
I flash a slick grin sayin' cool with nuance
The donut eater sweatin' at the blacks we all fronts
He asked my whats my name
I told him Mark Essex
Sucker I got lessons forever I'm 'bout to bless it
Ay yo Sule noise it up
Blocks

I know you feel that you're real
Until you check the steelo, peep the crew members
Brothers like Ambush and C.0
Filthy rich down to mansey savage
Dashown, Has Kaos who's the method to your madness
Real troops so walk around with the joint so get the point
Get get the point get the point get the point
And now lounge to the sounds cause the best spoke
I catch you on the next note
Or on the block

Originals got the funk
We got the funk yeah
Hip Hop gots the funk
He keeps the funk yeah
Teri got the funk
Monica got the funk
D.P.S. got the funk

Operation from the bottom got the funk
