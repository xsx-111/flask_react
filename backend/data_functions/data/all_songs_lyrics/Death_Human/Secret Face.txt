Secret Face Lyrics
There is a mask
That covers up one's true intentions
Once removed things become very clear
Analyze behavior
Patterns to see beneath the person
That is presented to you

Vulnerable through trust, life is a twisted maze of obstacles
Presented by people with a
Secret face

What's on the outside
Is not always all that is real
Live by caution, what I feel
When things are reversed
People are shown for what they are
The truth is revealed

Banish the false
Pacifying moments with an
Acquired disguise to obtain
The things they want
By the anguish of someone else
Materialistic motives are fulfilled
Cherish the true
Vulnerable through trust, life is a twisted maze of obstacles
Presented by people with a
