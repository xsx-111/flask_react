Together as One Lyrics
Labelled a creation of evil
Ridiculed for their shocking appearance

Sharing both pleasure and pain
Two minds, two hearts, one soul

Separating mentally
An illusion of privacy

Together - they absorb each other's lives
As one - they will live and they will die
A living hell has begun

Displayed as a nightmare
Criticized through words and eyes
As they stare
To the normal it seems grotesque
Connected by a, a bond of flesh

Sharing both pleasure and pain
Two minds, two hearts, one soul
Separating mentally
An illusion of privacy

Together - they absorb each other's lives
As one - they will live and they will die
A living hell has begunEmbed
