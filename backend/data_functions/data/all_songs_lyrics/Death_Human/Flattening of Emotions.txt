Flattening of Emotions Lyrics
Where is the person
That could have been
Who, what took over
When did the end begin

Should we not prepare
For the uncertain
Mysteries of our life
Of our destiny

See things that are not there
Intruding voices

What went wrong
To their picture perfect life
They once knew
Flattening of emotions

A mind shared by
An uninvited stranger
Which comes and goes
As it choose to appear
Should we not prepare
For the uncertain
Mysteries of our life
Of our destiny

See things that are not there
Intruding voices

What went wrong
To their picture perfect life
They once knew
Flattening of emotionsEmbed
