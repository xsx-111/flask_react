Vacant Planets Lyrics
Mysterious object of flight
On a voyage
To correct what they have done
What we are doing

Perhaps submerged
Living in the innermost
Recesses of the planet
No choice but
To adapt to an underground world

Limiting our passages of thought

Are they the examples of regression
A life form's abusive progression
In a realm so vast
We sit among the Vacant Planets

So many worlds yet to be seen
That once have shared
The same effects that come from greed
Mass production
Perhaps submerged
Living in the inner most
Recesses of the planet
No choice but
To adapt to an underground world

Limiting our passages of thought

Are they the examples of regression
A life form's abusive progression
In a realm so vast
We sit among the Vacant Planets1Embed
