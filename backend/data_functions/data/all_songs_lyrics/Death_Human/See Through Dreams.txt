See Through Dreams Lyrics
Born into darkness
Where sounds portray
The images that are out
Out of reach from my sight

Which has been denied
Hands change into my eyes
Body senses intensified
Sight so close yet far away

In dreams my thoughts take their form
To give memories identity

Through dreams I obtain
The ability to connect sight with sound

Close your eyes
And imagine to be without
What we take for granted
Every time we open our eyes
A permanent shadow
Never to step away
Feel the dark in the cold
Feel the warmth of the light

Which has been denied
Hands change into my eyes
Body senses intensified
Sight so close yet far away

In dreams my thoughts take their form
To give memories identity

Through dreams I obtain
The ability to connect sight with sound1Embed
