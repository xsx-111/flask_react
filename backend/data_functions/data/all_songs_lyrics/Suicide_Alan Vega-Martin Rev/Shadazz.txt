Shadazz Lyrics
She came from outta the skies
A renegade lady, a future queen
She came a-singing the andromeda blues
Sweet sexy lady, creole queen
She came with those lights in her eyes
Sweet, sexy lady, I’m on my knees
She came with those big brown eyes
Sweet, sexy lady, shadazz

Sweet, sexy lady, shadazz
Sweet, sexy lady, shadazz
Sweet, sexy lady, just like jazz
Oh, shadazz, oh, shadazz
Oh, shadazz, oh, shadazz

She’s there using her father’s name
African Messiah, ahead of her time
She said I’m a black star singing queen
Flying for them, fighting for all
She’s there for all of us to see
A raging sex symbol, oh dear lord
She there and I’m on my knees
Sweet, sexy lady, shadazz
Sweet, sexy lady, shadazz
Sweet, sexy lady, shadazz
Sweet, sexy lady, just like jazz
Oh, shadazz, oh, shadazz
Oh shadazzEmbed
