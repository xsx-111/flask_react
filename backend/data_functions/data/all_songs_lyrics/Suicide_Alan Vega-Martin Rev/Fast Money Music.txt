Fast Money Music LyricsFast money music, fast money music
It's a deal, they say, it's a deal, they say
Slap you on the hand, you take it on the run
You look the other way, you look the other way
Fast money music, fast money music
Woah, ooh
Fast money music, fast money music
You get a handout, you get a handshake
You get the fame, and then you get the money
It's a fast money big time, it's a fast money big time
Fast money music, fast money music
Wooh, ooh, shh
Fast money music, fast money music
It's all you wanna hear, you don't really care
Get in while you can, 
It's a fast money sit out, it's a fast money sit up
Fast money music, fast money music
Woah, ooh, sss
Fast money music, fast money music
"It's a deal" they said, "it's a deal" they said
Slap you on the hand, you take it on the run
You look the other way, you look the other way
Fast money music, fast money music
Woah, ooh, shhEmbed
