Las Vegas Man LyricsLas Vegas man, Las Vegas man
Going to the star, going to the star
The big orange star, the big orange star
It's so far, so very, very far
To the big money wheel, to the big money wheel
Las Vegas man, Las Vegas man
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, it's over there
The loser lounge, the loser lounge
He's a-throwin' the dice
Looking for a 7/11, looking for a 7/11
All his life, all his life
He's stayin' alive, yeah, he's stayin' alive
Losing his drive, losing his drive
Las Vegas man, Las Vegas man
He's stayin' alive, he's stayin' alive
Oh, losing his drive, losing his driveEmbed
