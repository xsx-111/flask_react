Sweetheart LyricsSweetheart, sweetheart
Sweetheart, I love you
Let's make it tonight
Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart
I love you so bright
Let's make it tonight
Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart
Oh sweetheart
Oh sweetheart
Oh sweetheart, I love you
I need you, I need you
Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart
Thank you, oh thank you
For lovin' me, for lovin' me
Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart
I love you, I love you
Mmm
I miss you so much, baby
So lonely, so lonely without you
You gotta come home to me, you gotta come home soon
Sweetheart
I love you
Come home babyEmbed
