Radiation Lyrics
Mama
Oh mama
I look at the sky
Four horsemen
Look at that, man
Oh I started to cry
Oh mama
Goodbye
Goodbye

The glory
The glory
Hallelujah
Look at that, man
It's radiation
Oh mama
I started to cry
Goodbye
Goodbye

Unravel
Itâ€™s radiation
Oh mama
Oh mama
Don't cry
Goodbye
GoodbyeEmbed
