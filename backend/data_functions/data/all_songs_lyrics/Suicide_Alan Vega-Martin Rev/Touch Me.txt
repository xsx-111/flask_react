Touch Me LyricsTouch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
Touch me soft, touch me soft
Cool as ice, cool as ice
Like I like it, like I like it
Like I like it, like I like it
Oh so soft, oh so soft
Oh so soft, oh so soft
Touch me, honey, like a kiss
Touch me, honey, like a kiss
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Cool as ice, cool as ice
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
Touch me soft, touch me soft
Cool as ice, cool as ice
Like I like it, like I like it
Like I like it, like I like it
Oh so soft, oh so soft
Oh so soft, oh so soft
Touch me, honey, like a kiss
Touch me, honey, like a kiss
Oh, do it, do it, do it do it
Cool as ice, cool as iceEmbed
