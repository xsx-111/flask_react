Mercy Lyrics
Hit the beat and take it to the verse now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I love you
But I gotta stay true
My moral's got me on my knees
I'm begging, please
Stop playing games

I don't know what this is, but you got me good
Just like you knew you would
I don't know what you do, but you do it well
I'm under your spell

You got me begging you for mercy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me begging you for mercy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said release me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now you think that I
Will be something on the side
But you got to understand that I need a man
Who can take my hands, yes, I do

I don't know what this is, but you got me good
Just like you knew you would
I don't know what you do, but you do it well
I'm under your spell

You got me begging you for mercy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me begging you for mercy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said you'd better release me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, break it down

I'm begging you for mercy
(You look at me and think we're the same kind
'Cause you don't know what I got and)
Just why won't you release me?
(I'm gonna get more than I'm asking for
But I just don't want to waste my time)
I'm begging you for mercy
(You know that I'll be the other girl
Just like there's nothing in this world)
You got me begging
(I know that I'm gonna get me some)
(I just don't know where to get it from)
You got me begging
You got me begging
Mercy, why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm begging you for mercy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me begging you for mercy, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm begging you for mercy (Mercy, mercy, show me some mercy)
I'm begging you for mercy (Mercy, mercy, show me some mercy)
I'm begging you for mercy (Mercy, mercy, show me some mercy)
I'm begging you for mercy (Show me some mercy, show me some mercy)
Why won't you release me?
Yeah, yeah, break it down
Mercy, show me some mercy
You got me begging
Begging you for mercy
You got me begging
Down on my knees, I beg
You got me begging
Begging you for mercy
You got me begging2Embed
