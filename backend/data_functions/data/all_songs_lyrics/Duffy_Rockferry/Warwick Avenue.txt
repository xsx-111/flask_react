Warwick Avenue Lyrics
When I get to Warwick Avenue
Meet me by the entrance of the tube
We can talk things over a little time
Promise me you won't step out of line
When I get to Warwick Avenue
Please, drop the past and be true
Don't think we're okay just because I'm here
You hurt me bad, but I won't shed a tear

I'm leaving you for the last time, baby
You think you're loving, but you don't love me
I've been confused, out of my mind lately
You think you're loving, but I want to be free
Baby, you've hurt me

When I get to Warwick Avenue
We'll spend an hour, but no more than two
Our only chance to speak once more
I showed you the answers, now here's the door
When I get to Warwick Avenue
I'll tell you, baby, that we're through

I'm leaving you for the last time, baby
You think you're loving, but you don't love me
I've been confused, out of my mind lately
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I want to be free, baby, you've hurt me
All the days spent together
I wished for better
But I didn't want the train to come
Now it's departed
I'm broken-hearted
Seems like we never started
All those days spent together
When I wished for better
And I didn't want the train to come!
Oh, oh

You think you're loving, but you don't love me
I want to be free, baby, you hurt me
You don't love me, I want to be free
Baby, you've hurt me6Embed
