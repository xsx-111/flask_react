Syrup & Honey Lyrics
Don't you be wasting all your money
On syrup and honey
Because I'm sweet enough
Don't you be using every minute
On making a living
Because we got our love

Listen to me
One, two, three
Baby, baby, baby
Spend your time on me

Don't you be out all night long
Leaving me all alone
Because I, I need your love
Don't you be spending every day
Working away
Because I'm waiting for you

Listen to me
One, two, three
Baby, baby, baby
Spend your time on me
Spend it, spend it, spend it
Your time on me
Please, baby
Mmm
Please, babyEmbed
