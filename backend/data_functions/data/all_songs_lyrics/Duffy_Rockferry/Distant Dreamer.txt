Distant Dreamer Lyrics
Although you think I cope
My head is filled with hope
Of some place other than here
Although you think I smile
Inside and all the while
I'm wondering about my destiny

I'm thinking about all the things
I'd like to do in my life
I'm a dreamer, a distant dreamer
Dreaming far away from today

Even when you see me frown
My heart won't let me down
Because I know there's better things to come, whoa yeah
And when life gets tough
And I feel I've had enough
I hold on to a distant star

I'm thinking about all the things
I'd like to do in my life
I'm a dreamer, a distant dreamer
Dreaming far away from today
I'm a dreamer, a distant dreamer
Dreaming far away from today
Yeah, I'm a dreamer
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm a dreamer, a distant dreamer
Dreaming far away from today
Yeah, I'm a dreamer
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm a dreamer1Embed
