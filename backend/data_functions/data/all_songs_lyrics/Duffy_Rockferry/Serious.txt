Serious Lyrics
I always wanted to see the colors of your destiny
I always wanted to know if our love would grow
Serious, serious

I'm a trophy on your arm
You wear me like a charm
Yes, you do
An accessory that suits
Your new suede boots
Ohh

I get a feeling deep down inside
Something just ain't right
I get a feeling that tells me I know
Baby, you never show
How you really feel for me
Tell me, can we ever be
Serious? Serious in love?

A joke on my expense
In front of all your friends
All the time
A game you like to play
Leaves me solo everyday
I get a feeling deep down inside
Something just ain't right
I get a feeling that tells me I know
Baby, you never show
How you really feel for me
Tell me, can we ever be
Serious? Serious in love?
Serious? Serious in love?
I get a feeling deep down inside
That something just ain't right
I get a feeling that tells me I know
Baby, you never show
How you really feel for me
Tell me, can we ever be, tell me
Serious? Serious in love?

Serious, so serious
Oh
Serious, so serious
Break it down
Serious
Break it down, now, child
Serious, baby
Serious
