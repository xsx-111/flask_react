Delayed Devotion Lyrics
It seems you wanna give me
Oh, a lifetime of security
Down on your dying knees
I watch you beg, I watch you plead
But your words come much too late
My love for you has turned to hate
'Cause you've taken too much time
To show me that you're mine

When I drop you, boy
You'll need another toy
One that won't stand up for herself
When I knock you down
You'll need another town
Where somebody's gonna talk to you
You just let me wait
Now it's too late
For your delayed, delayed devotion

You try to convince me
Oh, about the possibilities
But I know that all your poetry
Just comes from insecurity
'Cause your actions speak nothing no more
When it's what I've been waiting for
'Cause you've taken too much time
To show me that you're mine
When I drop you, boy
You'll need another toy
One that won't stand up for herself
When I knock you down
You'll need another town
Where somebody's gonna talk to you
'Cause you just let me wait
Now it's too late
For your delayed devotion

You played me for a fool for too long
Blinded by your lies, I never saw your wrong
I'm no longer under your spell
Hear it in a song: You can go to Hell

When I drop you, boy
You'll need another toy
One that won't stand up for herself
When I knock you down
You'll need another town
Where somebody's gonna talk to you
You just let me wait
And now it's too late
For your delayed, delayed devotionEmbed
