Draw(in)g to a (W)hole LyricsWe'll go to square one
We'll go to square one
We'll say squaring
I looked in to your eyes
And you looked in to my mouth
And you said something
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
To a whole
We'll get over it
We'll go around it
We'll do something
You looked in to my eyes
And I looked in to my mouth
We'll say something
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
To a wholeEmbed
