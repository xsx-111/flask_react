I Can See LyricsYou wake up and look around
The cloud, long and white
Is waitin’, waitin’ on us
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
It’ll work alright
It’ll work alright
It’ll work alright
You go out, around the sky
You try, can be shy
I know you can be shy
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I can see the night
He can be the light
Don’t say it’s not rightEmbed
