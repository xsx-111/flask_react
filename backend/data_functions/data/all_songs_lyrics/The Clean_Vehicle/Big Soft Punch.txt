Big Soft Punch LyricsWell we wait for the day
When the wind gets on its way
And we know what it brings
And we crawl on the roof
Scraping all our hands and knees
We don't need any proof
Heading off with the truth
Yeah they're waiting for the big soft punch
And they don't even know why
Yeah they're waiting for the big soft punch
They'll need it if they're to fly
Now they're inside
Running on a little room
And there's no time to hide
But the rains getting close
And they crawl away to hideEmbed
