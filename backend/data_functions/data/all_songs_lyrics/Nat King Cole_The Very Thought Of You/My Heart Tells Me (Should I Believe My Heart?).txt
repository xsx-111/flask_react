My Heart Tells Me (Should I Believe My Heart?) LyricsMy heart tells me
This is just a fling
Yet you say
Our love means everything
Do you mean
What you are saying
Or is this a little game
We're playing
My heart tells me
I will cry again
Lips that kiss
Like yours could lie again
If I'm fool enough
To see this through
Will I be sorry if I do
Should I believe my heart or you
My heart tells me
I will cry again
Lips that kiss
Like yours could lie again
If I'm fool enough
To see this through
Will I be sorry if I do
Should I believe my heart or youEmbed
