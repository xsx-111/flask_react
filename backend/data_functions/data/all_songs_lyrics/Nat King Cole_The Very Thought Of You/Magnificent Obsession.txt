Magnificent Obsession Lyrics
You're my magnificent obsession
The greatest wonder on this earth
The Taj Mahal and other splendors
To me really have no worth
You're my magnificent possession
A treasure lent me from above
As long as I have breath within me
You'll be my one and only love


You're my magnificent possession
A treasure lent me from above
As long as I have breath within me
You'll be my one and only loveEmbed
