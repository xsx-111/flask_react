I Wish I Knew the Way to Your Heart Lyrics
I wish I knew
Wish I knew if you want me to spend all my life loving you
The way that I feel is hard to conceal
But you don't reveal if you feel that way too
And I wish I knew
Wish I knew that you loved me as I care for you from the start
I found all your charms, your lips and your arms
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I wish I knew the way to your heart


And I wish I knew
Wish I knew that you loved me as I care for you from the start
I found all your charms, your lips and your arms
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I wish I knew the way to your heartEmbed
