I Found a Million Dollar Baby (In a Five and Ten Cent Store) Lyrics
It was a lucky April shower
It was the most convenient door
I found a million-dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store
The rain continued for an hour
I hung around for three or four
Around a million-dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes
I kept buying china
Until the crowd got wise
Incidentally

If you should run into a shower
Just step inside my cottage door
And meet the million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store


If you should run into a shower
Just step inside my cottage door
And meet the million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store
I found a million-dollar baby
In a five and ten cent storeEmbed
