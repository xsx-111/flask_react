Cherchez La Femme Lyrics
Cherchez la femme, look for a girl, and then monsieur
You're sure to find cloud silver-lined such is amour
It's heavenly when you share a kiss
Sweet ecstasy with a sweet young miss
Since time began, there's not a man who can deny
The thrill he feels when she reveals that he's her guy
You won't regret it, of this I am sure
Cherchez la femme, look for the girl, monsieur


You won't regret it, of this I am sure
Cherchez la femme, look for the girl, monsieurEmbed
