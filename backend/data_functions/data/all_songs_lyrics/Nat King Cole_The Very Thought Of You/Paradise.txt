Paradise LyricsAnd then she hold my hand-
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
And then I understand-
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Her eyes afire
With one desire
Then a heavenly kiss:
Could I resist?
*And then I dim the light-
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
And then I hold her tight-
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise
(Instrumental interlude and pick up at *.)
And when I dim the light
Mm-mm-mm-mm, she's willing
And when I hold her tight
Mm-mm-mm-mm, it's thrilling
Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradiseEmbed
