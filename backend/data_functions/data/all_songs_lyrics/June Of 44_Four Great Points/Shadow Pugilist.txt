Shadow Pugilist LyricsYou will never know
How I let you slip through my hands
Maybe it will come to blows
There's nothing to understand
All the time you drift along
Too high, too afraid to come down
Shadow riding, you fall
The elongated light makes you topple down
Transistor radio
A makeshift bookshelf
A photograph of a girl buried in sand up to the neck
Wearing sunglasses, smiling
You whisked yourself away in a cab down Broadway
The cab went 'round a corner
Each step away from the curb
Unmeasurable by a sextant
The face of a constellation
Connecting the dots with lines
To make your memory
All the time you drift along
Too high, too afraid to come down
Shadow riding, you fall
The elongated light makes you topple downEmbed
