Cut Your Face LyricsDay in, day out again
Sound in, sound out again
Overrated stack of zeros
Stated with indifference
Plain and simple
Bury your hands
In the great rinse
This air, these hands
This air, these hands
Save your claim
Watch it come
With marginal desperation
State your claim
Worth the wait
Weight of your sound
Day in, day out
Time in, time out
Plain and simple
It's plain, it's simple
Show me how you cut your face
Where it hurts
Bury your hands
In the sound of fiction 
Fiction, fiction, fiction 
All I can say is
I'm tired of accusations
I'm not that kind of guy
All this
All this skin 
This air
And a voice, pure
And simple, simple
All I can say is
I'm tired of accusations
I'm not that kind of guy
Why you cut your face?Embed
