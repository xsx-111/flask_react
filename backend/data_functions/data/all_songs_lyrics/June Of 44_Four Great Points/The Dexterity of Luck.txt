The Dexterity of Luck LyricsSaid I don't mean to shock ya
But I'm gonna tell ya 'bout my chakra
And about the accidental conception
Of the particle board for ya
Okay, now uh
She's punch drunk, abbreviated
Outside the passenger window
An open mouth in the form of a butterfly catching net
The stars see her cold black eyes
Just above the belly of Texas
She says I'm gonna get some opinion and put it in ya
Watch you foam at the mouth
And try and sing today
It's impossible to gauge the path
Of a reciprocal conversation
We'll just pass the exit to Bombay
First mile reminiscent of a flock of snow geese
Landing on a glass pond
She says one last thing
Hey wait a minute, just one last thing
Don't forget to pick the needle up off the lock groove
Its impossible to gauge the belly of Texas!
Cyclical conversation, butterfly catching net
Her cold black eyes landing on a glass pond
Accidental conception
Abbreviated outside the passenger window
She said one last thing
Yeah, just one last thing
Don't forget to pick the needle up off the lock grooveEmbed
