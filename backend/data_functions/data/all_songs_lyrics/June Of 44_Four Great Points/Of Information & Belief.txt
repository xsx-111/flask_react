Of Information & Belief LyricsThis is the greatest place on earth
Interstated north and south
I know you won't go far away
Three full rooms full night and day
We can't stay here
It's time to go
Ten half one two two, st marks place
Trust fund, beggars, out in space
How did we get here?
We must leave
Information and belief
Your time has come
Your day is done
Show me just one thing
Make it real
You can send me anywhere
Sing to me
Your time has come
Your day is done
We can't stay here
We can't stay here
We've been warned into deep
We've been warned into deep
Nailed to the floor
Into deep
I am uncertain, it's unclear
East side highway brings us here
I am uncertain, it's unclear
Our time has come, we must leave
One day, one night
Turn back, this time
This is the greatest place on earth
Interstated north and southEmbed
