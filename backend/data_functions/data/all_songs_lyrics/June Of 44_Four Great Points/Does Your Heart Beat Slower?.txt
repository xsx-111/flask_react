Does Your Heart Beat Slower? LyricsExperiment
December 31
1999
Governed by resolution
And naked souls
And naked souls
Our canyon is a palace
A lucky strike in north america
Build morgues
And water towers
And the sound
And the sound
Of airwaves on new year's eve
Air gets slower
Take down your art
Take down your art
Take down your art
Take down your art
As a result
Take down your art
As a result
Shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, shame
Laser beams
Telescopes
Dictate directions
Dictate directions
Dictate directions
Dictate directions
Modify the beaten path
She's waiting for this
She's waiting for him
(Shame, shame, shame)
She's waiting for this
She's waiting for him
(Shame, shame, shame)
Take down your artEmbed
