Atin Cu Pung Singsing LyricsAtin cu pong singsing
May batong kay inam
Binigay sa akin
Ng mahal kong nanay
Sa tapat ng dibdib
Iningat-ingatan
Kung saan nawaglit
'Di ko na nalaman
Take me back to my memories of growing up
I remember sing, singin’ this song as I was playing it around
Those were good memories linger here it in again
Pure joy and happiness and brings as I sing, sing, sing, sing
Nawala ang singsing
'Di ko na nakita
Abot hanggang langit
Ang taglay kong dusa
Sino mang binata
Ang makakukuha
Ang abang puso ko
Ay magiging kanya
Take me back to my memories of growing up
I remember sing, singin' this song as I was playing it around
Those were good memories linger here it in again
Pure joy and happiness and brings as I sing, sing, sing, sing
Atin cu pung singsing
Metung yang timpucan
Amana que iti
Quing indung ibatan
Sancan queng sininup
Queng metung a caban
Mewala ya iti
E cu camalayan
Take me back to my memories of growing up
I remember sing, singin’ this song as I was playing it around
Those were good memories linger here it in again
Pure joy and happiness and brings as I sing, sing, sing, singEmbed
