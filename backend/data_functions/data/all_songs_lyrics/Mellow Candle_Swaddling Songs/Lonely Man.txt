Lonely Man LyricsLonely man looking for the day
Damns the night whose stars have left him cold
Lonely man doesn't know they're watching
Shouting all his questions to the sky
Lonely man
Lonely man searching for the sea
Fears the doom of ocean's prisoner
Lonely man doesn't see the seagull
Burying his weeping in the waves
Lonely man
Lonely man living all alone
Dreads the day whose dawn will find him cold
Lonely man doesn't see the millions
Waiting for their answers from the sky
