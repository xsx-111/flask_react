Reverend Sisters LyricsReverend Sisters I remember were it yesterday
Standing young and green before the wisdom age and your black habits wrought
"life is not a dream you know" you said
"at your age you couldn't know" you said
"come into our office and I'll show you
Come into our office and I'll tell you where to go"
Reverend Sisters I remember standing in your hall
There among the masses watching reverence speaking from the stage
"life is all too short my dears" she said
"wisdom will come with the years" she said
"come into our office and I'll show you
Come into our office and I'll tell you where to go"
Where to go?
Reverend Sisters I remember everything you see
All your words and teachings left some imprint on my memory
Though I'm sad it had to be this way
As you said we change with every day
Reverend Sisters though I hate to say it
Now the veils are lifted from my eyes and I can see
I can seeEmbed
