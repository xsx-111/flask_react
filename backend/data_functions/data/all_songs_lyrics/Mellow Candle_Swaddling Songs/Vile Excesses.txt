Vile Excesses LyricsSolstice brings the chill winds to an end
Blows summers into chambers cold
Dressed as she is in her green and gold
Winter moon turns in another sky
Spun by a ghostly sailor's hand
Freezing the earth of another land
If the winter winds have made you cold
Can you not be glad they have not made you old
With wondering and learning how to fly
All that stands must fall to ash and sand
Struggling to grasp the spirit's hand
Brings sadness raining from within the song of songs
Tell me show me teach me where you've been
Did you see shadows of unicorns
Did you wear laurels or a crown of thorns
Tell me show me teach me where you've been
Did you see shadows of unicorns
Did you wear laurels or a crown of thorns
Dance through sadness dance through tears of rage
Dance for the poet d-d-dance for the Queen
Dancing for something you've never seen
Rhapsodising pain will make you blind
Harmonising rain can help you find
The way to understand and learning how to cry
All that stands must fall to ash and sand
Struggling to grasp another's hand
Brings sadness raining from within the song of songs
And if time should turn her other cheek
It's no illusion to be unique
In your own eye is the light you seek
