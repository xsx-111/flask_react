Sheep Season LyricsWinding up a hillside where the shepards roam
Counting their flocks in the gloaming
Shining the sea
Winking its light to the froth and the foam
Chilling the air with his shady tread
On came the wolf with surprise
Filling his eyes
With soft sapless creatures soon to be dead
Hurry the shepard man wizened and olden
Go and wave your staff at him
He has come to bury you for claiming his fold
Stillness came into the misty meadows
Down from the banks to the woodland
Clouds gather in skies
Giving their rains into mountains to flow
Hurry the shepard man wizened and olden
Go and wave your staff at him
He has come to bury you for claiming his foldEmbed
