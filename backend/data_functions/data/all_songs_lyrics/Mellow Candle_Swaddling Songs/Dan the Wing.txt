Dan the Wing LyricsHell's awake and the devil crows
Greets the day with a gale that blows
Beyond his furthest realm into Daniel's kingdom
Who has woken who has broken
Dan the Wing's infernal dreams?
The devil's croak and gale
Awoke Daniel from his dreams
Dan's awake and the starlings fly
Rooks and ravens fill the sky
Around his mighty head rising from the mountain
"Who has woken who has broken
Every nightmare's bridle so?
I think I smell the gales of Hell
I think I smell the devil!"
"Dan!" the ravens cry, "Beware
And heed no sign on that gale
Dan, the devil calls you
Beckons you to Hell!
Dan, the devil calls you, Dan!"
Dan's away with a mighty roar
Spans the sky till he spies the shore
Of Hell and the Sea of Sin and the blackness of that ocean
Hell's a-grumbling, Daniel's tumbling
From the sky at the devil's curse:
"The Sinful Sea of Hell will be
Dan the Fin's dominion!"
"Dan!" the ravens cry, "The devil
Wrote your name on that gale
Dan, the devil called you
Beckoned you to Hell!
Dan, the devil has you now!"Embed
