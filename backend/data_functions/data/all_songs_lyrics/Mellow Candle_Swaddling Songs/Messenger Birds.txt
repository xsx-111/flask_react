Messenger Birds LyricsShe sat thinking under a black sky
With a white child, a white child on her knee
Leaning to the dim, grim grey sea
Into a silent sleep
He lay wondering under the same coal sky
What the white child and she had gone to see
It was the clouded and cold night, bright sea
A woman kneel where her child used to be
While the wind will bring them secret tears
Wash away their smiles in a rain across the sand
Seagulls take to a land where they'll not hear of his cries
Nor see the fallen tears of the white child's eyesEmbed
