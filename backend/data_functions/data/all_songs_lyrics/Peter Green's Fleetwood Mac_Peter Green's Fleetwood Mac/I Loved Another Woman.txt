I Loved Another Woman Lyrics
My baby gone and left me crying by myself
My baby gone and left me crying by myself

I loved another woman - I lost my best gal

She was a real good woman, she didn't mean me no harm
She was a real good woman, she wouldn't do me no harm

But I loved another woman - now she's up and she's gone


Well come back baby, I know I treated you wrong
Well come back baby, I know I treated you wrong

I loved another woman - now, I won't do that no more

Whooo oooohEmbed
