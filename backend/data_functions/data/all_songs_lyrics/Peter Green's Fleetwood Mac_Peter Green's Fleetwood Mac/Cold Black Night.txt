Cold Black Night Lyrics
It was a cold black night and the rain was falling down
I went out looking for my girl
I knew she wasn't nowhere around
She left me early that morning
With a suitcase in her hand
And she took off on a train this morning
And she was meeting some other man, yes
She used to treat me real good
And I wonder why I didn't treat her right
Yes, ah, you know I wonder why I didn't treat her right
And now all I can do, is walk those streets both day and nightEmbed
