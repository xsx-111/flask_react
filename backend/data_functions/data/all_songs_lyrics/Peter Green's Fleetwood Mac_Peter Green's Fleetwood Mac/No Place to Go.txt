No Place to Go Lyrics
How many more years -
Have you got to wreck my life?
How many more years -
Have you got to wreck my life?
Well, the way you done me
Going to wreck my life
How many more times -
You going to treat me like you do?
How many more times -
You going to treat me like you do?
You spend all my money
All my loving too
Now I'm old and grey
Got no place to go
Now I'm old and grey
Got no place to go
You got yourself a youngster
You can't stand me no moreEmbed
