Hellhound on My Trail Lyrics
Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving
Hellhound on my trail
Hellhound on my trail

If today was Christmas Day
If today was Christmas Day
And tomorrow was Christmas Eve
Lord, wouldn't we have a time, boys?

Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving
Hellhound on my trail
Hellhound on my trailEmbed
