Swans LyricsSwans and their partners they stay
Faithful forever or die on the water
Foxes are only good for
Ruffling feathers, leading lambs to the slaughter
Swans, effortlessly beautiful, take care
You ought to be aware of foxes hiding
Go on, there's time for you to sail back to his side
While I forget I ever saw you gliding
Swans and their partners they stay
Faithful forever or die on the water
Swans, effortlessly beautiful, take care
You ought to be aware of foxes hiding
Go on, still time for you to sail back to his side
While I forget I ever saw you gliding
Swans, haa-aaa, swansEmbed
