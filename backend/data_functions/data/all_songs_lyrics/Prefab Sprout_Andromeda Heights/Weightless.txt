Weightless LyricsWho was Yuri Gagarin?
He was the first man in funky bass, funky bass
Space, space, space...hahahahaaa
Somewhere among the stars tonight, my heart
Floats like a Russian satellite
Weightless, love is a pure sensation
Weightless, I feel like Yuri Gagarin
Somewhere among the stars tonight
I call out to a passing fireball
Weightless, love is a pure sensation
Weightless, I feel like Yuri Gagarin
Weightless among the stars tonight
Weightless among the stars
Love put me in space way above the trees
Listen NASA can you get my heart back please?
Weightless among the stars tonight
Weightless among the stars
Love has given me a new slant on it all
The Galaxy's a nightclub, Earth's a mirror ball
Weightless
Somewhere among the stars tonight, I spin
And only you can reel me in (and only you can reel me in)
Weightless, love is a pure sensation
Weightless, I feel like Yuri Gagarin
Gagarin, Gagarin, GagarinEmbed
