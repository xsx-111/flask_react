The Mystery of Love LyricsHave you ever thought who made all those stars
In the endless sky above
It's a mystery, but no mystery like the mystery of love
Should I live to see someone smarter than me
Explain the secrets of the skies
I won't be too impressed, I've got a tougher test
What's going on behind your eyes?
What you see in me I will never know
That's the mystery of love
But each time we kiss
Ignorance is bliss
That's the mystery of love
That's the mystery, that's the mystery, that's the mystery of love
That's the mystery, that's the mystery, that's the mystery of love
What you see in me I will never know
That's the mystery of love
But each time we kiss
Ignorance is bliss
That's the mystery of love
And while I do not know who made them long ago
I love the stars that light the night
And when you take my hand, what is there to understand ?
I only know that it feels right
Yes each time we kiss
Ignorance is bliss
That's the mystery of love
That's the mystery, that's the mystery, that's the mystery of love
That's the mystery, that's the mystery, that's the mystery of love
What you see in me I'll never knowEmbed
