Anne Marie LyricsThere's a person that I'd like to be, Anne Marie
I can glimpse him when you're next to me, Anne Marie
There is music that no-one can hear, Anne Marie
Yet it's audible when you are near
Anne Marie, Anne Marie, what am I to do?
You are married to someone else yet
Every waking hour I think of you
Oh listen to me Anne Marie
Anne Marie, Anne Marie, nothing much is new
I've a history of wanting what I cannot have
This time it is you
Don't listen to me Anne Marie
Anne Marie, there's a person that I'd like to be, Anne Marie
I can glimpse him when you're next to me, Anne Marie
There's a music that no-one can hear, Anne Marie
Yet it's audible when you are near
Oh Anne Marie, this world's an unfamiliar place I see
When you're with me, when you're with me
I hear strange music in undiscovered keys
When you're with me, when you're with me
Anne Marie, Anne Marie, it's time to walk away
I have never been noble but then
Maybe being noble feels this way
When you're next to me Anne Marie
Anne Marie, and though it's time
I can't believe that I'm saying goodbye
Anne Marie, why?Embed
