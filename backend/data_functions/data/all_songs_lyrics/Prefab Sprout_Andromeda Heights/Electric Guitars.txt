Electric Guitars LyricsI'd a dream that we were rock stars
And that flash bulbs popped the air
And girls fainted every time we shook our hair
We were songbirds, we were Greek Gods
We were singled out by fate
We were quoted out of context, it was great
Grander than castles, cathedrals or stars
(Electric Guitars)
Riots in airports, everywhere that we go
Mascara meltdown, hysteria-a-go-go
(Electric Guitars)
Grander than castles, cathedrals or stars
(Electric Guitars)
Riots in airports, everywhere that we go
Mascara meltdown, hysteria-a-go-go
(Electric Guitars)
Electric Guitars
When I woke up I was laughing
Well what else was I to do
Every detail of the dream I had was true
We were songbirds, we were Greek Gods
We were singled out by fate
We were quoted out of context, we were (great)
Grander than castles, cathedrals or stars
(Electric Guitars)
Riots in airports, everywhere that we go
Mascara meltdown, hysteria-a-go-go
(Electric Guitars)
Grander than castles, cathedrals or stars
(Electric Guitars)
Riots in airports, everywhere that we go
Mascara meltdown, hysteria-a-go-go
(Electric Guitars)
Grander than castles, cathedrals or stars, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Everywhere that we go
Mascara meltdown, hysteria-a-go-go, jo-jo
