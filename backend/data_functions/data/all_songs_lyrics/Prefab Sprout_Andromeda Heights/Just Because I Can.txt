Just Because I Can LyricsWhoah whoah
When the wolf man came to town
Whoah whoah
He ate the princess and her crown
If you ask him why
Wolf man will reply
Just because the rhythm's right
Just the moon is white
Just because I can
Just because I can, uh
Just because you fit the bill
Just because a look can kill
Just because I will
Just because I will
Ever since the world began
Ever since the dawn of man
It's just because I can
Whoah whoah
When the princess saw the beast
Whoah whoah
She smiled and organised a feast
If you ask her why
Princess will reply
Just because the rhythm's right
Just the moon is white
Just because I can
Just because I can, uh
Just because you fit the bill
Just because a look can kill
Just because I will
Just because I will
Ever since the world began
Ever since the dawn of man
It's just because I can
Just because I can, uh
Ever since the world began
Ever since the dawn of man
It's just because I can
Just because I can
Just because I can
Just because I canEmbed
