Steal Your Thunder LyricsPerhaps one day I'll love another
Whose eyes may be storm cloud grey
Whose every kiss is as hot as summer
With the suns every ray
But no-one's ever, ever gonna steal
Ever gonna steal your thunder
Never, ever gonna steal
Ever gonna steal your thunder
Never, ever gonna steal your thunder
Of course, I might get lucky
And roll a six on the dice
Three is a chance I'll be lucky
And see lightning strike twice
But no-one's ever, ever gonna steal
Ever gonna steal your thunder
Never, ever gonna steal
Ever gonna steal
No no (no no no no no no no no no no no no no)
No-one's ever, ever gonna steal, ever gonna steal your thunder
No-one's ever, ever gonna steal your thunderEmbed
