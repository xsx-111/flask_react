Avenue of Stars LyricsLove is an Avenue of Stars, I know because I've seen the glow
Lighting up faces, faces that have been
Close enough to shine at what they have seen
Love is an Avenue of Stars, and if it is light years away
One day I'll get there nursing tired feet
Happy beyond words to be on that street
Each step is hard, each step is slow
Each step unsure and yet I know
Love is an Avenue of Stars and though I'm tired and I'm lame
My will is iron and one day I will race
Down that silver highway, light on my face
Until then, until that day
One single thought lights up the way
Love is an Avenue of Stars
Avenue of Stars, Avenue of Stars, Avenue of StarsEmbed
