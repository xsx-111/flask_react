The Fifth Horseman LyricsYou don't have to see me to know that I'm around
Pupils dilate, the anxious heart will pound
If you've a problem sleeping, well that's a danger sign
It means your troubled heart will soon be mine
The Bible mentions four
I tell you there's one more
Love is the Fifth Horseman, Love is the Fifth Horseman
Love is the Fifth Horseman of the apocalypse
Love is the Fifth Horseman, Love is the Fifth Horseman
Love is the Fifth Horseman of the apocalypse
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
So know that I could catch you at any time I choose
I do not feel the ground beneath my shoes
This stallion I am riding, his pedigree, his pride
Won't let him rest 'til I am by your side
The Bible mentions four
I'm living proof of more
Love is the Fifth Horseman, Love is the Fifth Horseman
Love is the Fifth Horseman of the apocalypse
Love is the Fifth Horseman, Love is the Fifth Horseman
Love is the Fifth Horseman of the apocalypse
Love is the Fifth Horseman of the apocalypse
Yeah yeah, yeah yeahEmbed
