Lovers of Today LyricsI want you to be around ‘til the summer comes along
And I don't mind you hanging around ‘til the summer comes along
Then you make the first mistake of trying to walk before you can even run
I want you to be around ‘til the summer comes along
And I don't mind having you around ‘til the summer comes along
Then you go and make that first mistake of trying to walk before you can even run
I wanna be by your side
I, it's so cold on this side
I wanna tell ya about love
Love that's around today
We're lovers of today
We ain't got feelings
We've got no love
We ain't got nothing to say
We're lovers of today
If we ever touched it would disturb the calm
Physical effort often causes mental harm
I don't have the energy
You could say things get pretty tranquil with me
Maybe you can't see
But I love you baby
Much more than me
When you know that's all to know
Maybe you'll just come and see the show
We ain't got feelings
We've got no love
We ain't got nothing to say
We're lovers of today
Lovers of today
