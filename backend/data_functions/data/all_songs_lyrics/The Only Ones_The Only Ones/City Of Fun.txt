City Of Fun LyricsI see good people drowning
In the sea of life
If you ever come through my town
I got a place for you to lie down
I say
Hey hey, can't you see
What you're doing to me
Hey hey, can't you see
What you're doing to me
I seen poor people dying
In the sea of love, love
If you ever come through my town
I got a place for you to lie down
Lie down
Hey hey, can't you see
What you're doing to me
Hey hey, can't you see
What you're doing to me
You've been living in the city of fun
You know there's only one way out
It's up to you
No, it's up to you
I've got a lot of people living here
They're all friends of mine
They try to steal my clothes and my food and my money and my drugs
They think they've struck gold
Hey hey, can't you see
What you're doing to me
Hey hey, can't you see
What you're doing to me
Hey hey, can't you see
What you're doing to me
Hey hey can't you see
What you're doing to meEmbed
