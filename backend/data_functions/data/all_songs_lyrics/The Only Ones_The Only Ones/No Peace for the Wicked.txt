No Peace for the Wicked LyricsWhy do I go through these deep emotional traumas?
Why can't I be like I always wanted to be, carefree?
Why can't I be happy like everybody else?
There's no peace for the wicked
They say no peace for the wicked
Loud and clear, no peace for the wicked
The angels tell me
No peace for the wicked
Sitting at home, trying to forget the world outside
You're on the phone telling me there's no love inside me
What have I done to deserve this hostility?
There's no peace for the wicked
They say no peace for the wicked
Loud and clear, no peace for the wicked
The angels tell me
No peace for the wicked
I'm in love with extreme mental torture
I'm in love with the way you hold your head and cry
I'm in love with all these affairs of the heart
There's no peace for the wicked
They say no peace for the wicked
Loud and clear, no peace for the wicked
The angels tell me
No peace for the wickedEmbed
