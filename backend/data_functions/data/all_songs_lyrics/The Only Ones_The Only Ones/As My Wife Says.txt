As My Wife Says LyricsAs my wife says
This must be true love
I don't believe her but she
Knows me well enough
I recognise the symptoms
But I don't ever listen
To such morbid hysteria, ha ha
With your mannequin posture
To think that I almost lost ya
Such a soign√© thing to do
Your expression teases
Then it almost pleases
But I don't mind
Passing time this way, hey hey
Daily love so gaily
Cry in bed alone tonight
Hope one day you're going under
Stuck at home with a kid, it's frightening
You know I'm faster than lightningEmbed
