Language Problem LyricsMy parents told me that love don't exist just for pleasure
So I guess I'll throw in some pain for good measure
Good measure
Ah ha, ah ha
You'll be possessed and I can't be the possessor
I love my mother but I wouldn't want to have sex with her
Ah ha, ah ha
I've been outside this world and
I've seen all kind of girls but
I wish that I could talk to you
Ba ba ba bbbciffpvbyayzuaoo
Ever since I heard the way ya talk, I wanted you
You know I'm worth fooling
Taking drugs is one thing we got in common
It helps to overcome the language problem
The problem
Ah ha, ah ha
Feels the same in any language
And we both know how it can itch
And we really enjoy the damage
Ah ha, ah ha gjgjqwljroew
Ever since I heard the way ya talk, I wanted you
You know I'm worth foolingEmbed
