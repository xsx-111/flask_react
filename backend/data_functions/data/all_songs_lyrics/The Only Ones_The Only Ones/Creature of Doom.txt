Creature of Doom LyricsSomeone came up to me
And they said to me
I know something that you don't know
I was captured by this guise
A game of second lies
And said I'll follow where you go
It's our destiny
You and me
We could conquer the world
That's our destiny
We could conquer the world
You and me, ah ha
Is it hungry?
Is it dead?
Is it tired of life?
I know something that you don't know
I know something that you don't know
I know something that you don't know
Know, know
I've heard your evil laugh
I wrote your epitaph
In words you'll never understand
Looks like the final straw
Can't take any more
But I know that I won't die by the same hand
You'll be the death of me
I will meet the creature of the night
It'll be the death of me
This creature of the night
You'll see it soon
This creature of doom
Coming out, coming out of the gloom
And he says
I know something that you don't know
I know something that you don't know
I know something that you don't know
Know, know, know
Something that you don't know
Something that you don't know
Something that you don't know
Something that you don't knowEmbed
