The Beast LyricsRun from the beast
There's danger in his eyes
He's been looking for you
For a long time
You might think this is funny
But I'm not laughing
I know it couldn't happen to me
No one doubts the wisdom of this move
You're getting older and you know you got something to prove
Out in the streets
The modern vampire prowls
He's been spreading disease
All around
There's an epidemic
If you don't believe me
You ought to take a look at the eyes of your friends
When someone tempts you, you can't refuse
It's getting colder and you know you got nothing to lose
You need it
Know you got nothing to lose
You need it
Run from the beast
There's darkness in his mind
He's been looking for you
For a long time
You might think this is funny
But I'm not laughing
I know that it couldn't happen to me
I don't care about it happening to me
I've tried to show you your whole life in print
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink
Think about it
All you gotta do is think
About it
There's no cureEmbed
