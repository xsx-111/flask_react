The Immortal Story LyricsI used to dream of this
I lay awake at night imagining this
It was the only purpose in my life
But right now I'm terrified
Suddenly it's so close
Suddenly it's in reach
Suddenly it's really scaring me
Ah, it's so close
And I'm in its reach
It's telling me how I gotta be
They want you, they'll get you
I wish I didn't have to let you go
Even the best laid plans
Sometimes get out of hand
When dreams become reality
That's living death can't you see?
When you got the power
It gets abused
When you got the power it gets used
Travelling down the road
That leads to fame and glory
This really is the immortal story
They want you, they'll get you
I wish I didn't have to let you goEmbed
