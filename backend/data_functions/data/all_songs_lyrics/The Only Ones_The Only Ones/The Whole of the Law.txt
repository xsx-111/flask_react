The Whole of the Law LyricsI used to have the notion
I could swim the length of the ocean
If I knew you were waiting for me
I used to have the notion
I could swim the length of the ocean
I'd plumb the depths of every sea for you
I'll escape from my chains and I'll reach out for you
Baby, I'm in love with you
You, oh baby, baby I'm in love with you
I had to contact you, found out I was in love with you
I had to contact...
That's it, that's the law, that's the whole of the law
The whole of the law2Embed
