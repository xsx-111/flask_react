Imitation Of Christ LyricsAnother Christ is on the cross
The nails are words, the nails are lies
To make it crawl and make it scream
And make it real and make it bleed
And make it bleed and make it bleed
And make it bleed and make it dream
Imitation of Christ
Imitation of Christ
This you who lie and scream
You fall to dust, you fall to dust
In walls of word, your words are blind
You speak and you are dumb and blind
The word that is your god
Is you who fall so low and fall so far
Imitation of Christ
Imitation of Christ
Fly to the moon, dear, sew it on a stool
Tie it on the carpet, all the cowboys fall
See the cowboys fat and reeling
Dancing underneath the ceiling
Leave the bar, the theatre's closing
Make a wall of your religion
Imitation of Christ
Imitation of Christ
Mary, Mary, mother, mother
You and me and God the father
Jesus is a woman too
He looks like all of me and you
Your money talks and all your friends
Will laugh at her pathetic tits
Imitation of Christ
Imitation of Christ
Imitation of Christ
