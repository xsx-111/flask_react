Wedding Song LyricsPlay another wedding song
A wedding song goes on and on
See the churches falling down
This is only in your mind
We're useless
We're useless
All their dresses stand so white
All the brides are all in white
Play another wedding song
A wedding song goes on and on
We're useless
We're useless
Walking on the paper ruins
Shoes and rice and one two three
Picking through the plastic ruins
Of my useless memory
Make a line of useless women
Make a line of useless men
Love me love me love me love
Again again again again
We're useless
We're useless
