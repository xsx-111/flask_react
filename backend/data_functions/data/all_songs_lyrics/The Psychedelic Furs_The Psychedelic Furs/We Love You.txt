We Love You LyricsI'm in love with Catholics
I'm in love with your blue cars
I'm in love with the words that scream
We are so stupid, we all dream
I'm in love with Frank Sinatra
Fly me to the moon
I'm in love with fools like you
I'm in love with doing the twist
I'm in love with the bodies that scream
They fall so far, they fall so far
I'm in love with The Supremes
Oh, baby love
I'm in love with Sophia Loren
I'm in love with Bridget Bardot
I'm in love with the whole dumb scene
I'm so in love, you know what I mean
I'm in love with Anthea and Donna
All that shit that goes uptown top ranking
I'm in love with the factory
I'm in love with the BBC
I'm in love with your TV
They're so in love with you and me
(I'm in love with) A nuclear bomb it falls
(I'm in love with)Shopping city dreams
(I'm in love with) Real men
They go through the air for oxygen
Love is just a car like you
That turns so blue and turns so blue
No blue cars will run my world
No playboys will black my word
I would walk a million smiles
For one of your miles Bob
Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
We love you, we love you, we love you
We love you, we love you, we love you
We love you, we love you1Embed
