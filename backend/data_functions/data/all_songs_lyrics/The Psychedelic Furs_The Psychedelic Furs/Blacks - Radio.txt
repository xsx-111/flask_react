Blacks / Radio LyricsSick of the sex and the sound of their cars
And saying the words in elliptical bars
Dancing can be such attraction
When everybody is doing the fraction
When I went for a job I had to trade in my hair
And think of ideas in a Larker-Knoll chair
If it wasn't for the blacks in the south
My father's refrigerator factory would close down
Denise is such a dream, let her
Put it in the crutch of her knee, let her
Put it on a couch of... , let her
I feel just like money
I feel just like money
I feel just like money inside
And the women turn blue at around 45
The stupid and the stupid and the infantile
Listen to records with the A-bomb hairstyle
When I went for a job I had to trade in my hair
And think of ideas in a Larker-Knoll chair
If it wasn't for the blacks in the south
My father's refrigerator factory would close down
Denise is such a dream, let her
Put it in the crutch of her knee, let her
Put it on a couch of... , let her
Denise is such a dream, let her
Put it on a couch of... , let her
Put it in the crutch of her knee, let her
You were at the Relais in a shirt and tie
You cut your hair with a scissor at the Hotel Relais
Jealous trees call you 'Denny'
Even the trees seem to whisper 'Denny'
I'll love you till the world stops spinning
I'll love you till the world stops slimming
Doing the radio
People go to parties when they get a white shirt
They listen to records in a shirt and tie
The stupid and the stupid and the meaningless drivel
The stupid and the people and the meaningless lyric
Happening to people when they do their hands and knees
Jealous trees call you 'Denny'
Even the trees seem to whisper 'Denny'
I'll love till the world stops spinning
I'll love till the world stops slimming
Get a car and do the twist
Paint it blue and do the dog
Get a car and do the twist
TwistEmbed
