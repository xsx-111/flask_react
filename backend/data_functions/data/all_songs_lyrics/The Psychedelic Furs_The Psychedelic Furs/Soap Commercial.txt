Soap Commercial LyricsThis is my shirt, this is yours
And this is called a dream
It must be the soap you use
And mine is called So Kleen
It was so well advertised
All day on channel nine
We live in the soap commercial
We are all a lie
Listen to this
Listen to this
Listen to this
Listen to this
I live in the factory
And we are all the same
I live in the family
And all the traffic screams
We were so well advertised
All day on channel nine
We live in the soap commercial
We are all a lie
Listen to this
Listen to this
Listen to this
Listen to this
Channel nine
Soap commercial
