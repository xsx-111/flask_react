Yellow Moon Lyrics
Here, far away
One could feel the earth vibrate
Moon, changing shape and shade
As we all do under its gaze

Yellow Moon on the rise 

Around we go
Where we stop, yeah no one knows
So tonight, the moon I go


An echo that rings
A bullet unchained
One life, one grave
Joins the parade
The sky grows dark
With fallen stars
Who'd come so far
A headstone engraved
The colors turn gray
The black and white fades
