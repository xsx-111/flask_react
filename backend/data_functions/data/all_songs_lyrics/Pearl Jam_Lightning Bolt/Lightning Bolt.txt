Lightning Bolt LyricsShe comes on like a stone
But you don't know where from she was thrown
Like a burning meteor from miles high
Looking for a place to land
She said, "Have you got yourself some sand?"
And whatever you replied, she took as yes
Now she comes after thee
With her newly planted seeds and soon
You're prone down on your knees and there you dig
And then before you know
The weeds are obesely overgrown
With all the wild seed she sows in your sleep

You gotta know you'll never let her go
She's a lightning bolt
Lightning bolt
Lightning bolt
Always something and never nothing
Isn't that the way we're taught to be? To be
Flipping through the worn out pages
And stages when you knew not who to be, yeah yeah
Till the lightning strike sets you free, yeah
You gotta know you'll never let her go
She's a lightning bolt
Lightning bolt
Lightning bolt
Crashing stormy waves erode her
Shoreline everyday until the
Castle of her ways turns to sand
She holds her lovely breast
As her birds fall from the nest
Flying towards the great northwest, yeah yeah yeah
And with no repair in sight
There is no God with such might
As to open her world wide with subterfuge
And your death will soon arrive
As she finally decides
That all her problems, they won't die with you
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
I'm a lightning bolt
She's a lightning bolt
She's true
She's a lightning bolt
Uncontrollable
