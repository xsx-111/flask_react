Sleeping By Myself Lyrics
I should have known there was someone else
Down below I always kept it to myself

Now I believe in nothin'
Not today, as I move myself outta' your sight
I'll be sleepin' by myself tonight

I could never go with no one else
The hurt don't show, but who knows
Time will tell

Now I believe in nothin'
But the pain
And I can't see this turnin' out right
Oh, I'll be sleepin' by myself tonight

Forever be sad and lonely
Forever never be the same
I close my eyes, wait for a sign
Am I just waitin' in vain?
I close my eyes , wait for a sign
Am I just waitin' in vain?
Oh, I believe in love and disaster
Sometimes the two are just the same
I'm beginnin' to see, what's left of me
Is gonna' have to be free to survive
Oh, I'll be sleepin' by myself tonight

I believe in nothin'
But the pain
And I can't see this turnin' out right
Oh, I'll be sleepin' by myself
I'll be sleepin' by myself
I'll be sleepin' by myself tonightEmbed
