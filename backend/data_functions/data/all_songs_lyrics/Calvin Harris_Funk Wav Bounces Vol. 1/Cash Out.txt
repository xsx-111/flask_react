Cash Out Lyrics
You can rock it, you can sock it
You can even put on your brand new jacket
Because I'm the man who can put you in the musical brackets

Uh, party like it's 1980
Where the afro shiny and the girls all purty
Where the white girl molly
And a dark-skinned Kylie, can I rock both bodies? Ayy
New 'Rari, how I ride, both shotty, uh
Keep your table, can we boogie on the floor?
I've been stressin' all week, tryna clear it through the door now
Ballin' like LeBron now, shots like a pro now
Hella weed, yeah, it goes 'round
Let me tell you how it goes down
I ain't drivin' when it's goin', now pour me another cup
This your favorite song on, don't tell me you in a rush
When I give you all I have, you tell me it ain't enough
I've been tryna clear our mind and wine and dine ya
See I know just how you like it, I'll back behind ya
If I look up at the stars, ain't hard to find ya, ayy

Passin' all them neighbors, cash out (Cash out)
Smashin' all them 'Raris, dash out (Dash out)
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?
Now we count until we pass out
Passin' all them neighbors, cash out (Cash out)
Smashin' all them 'Raris, dash out (Dash out)
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?
Now we count it up until we pass out
Yo, uh, we gon' party like it's 1980
In a buggy-eyed 'Cedes or a dopeboy Caddy
With a nickel bag baggie, gold Rolex
Timin' for your climax climbin', got the bedsheets jumpin'
With your heartbeat pumpin' and your love keep comin'
Shake somethin', break somethin', shit, I'm tryna work somethin'
Sho' you right, motorbike, you could ride me overnight, uh
Never been one to judge, we rushin' back to the club
Put it down from above, your body my only drug
We do it like Vegas, rich and famous
We doin' it major, we wakin' the neighbors

Passin' all them neighbors, cash out (Cash out)
Smashin' all them 'Raris, dash out (Dash out)
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?
Now we count until we pass out
Passin' all them neighbors, cash out (Cash out)
Smashin' all them 'Raris, dash out (Dash out)
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?
Now we count it up until we pass out

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooohhh
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Say yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah) yeah, yeah
Okay, okay, okay, it's on, hey
Let's party like the '70s, blowin' on hella tree
Broccoli and collard greens (Collard greens)
It don't matter to me, yeah, yeah
Let's party like the '70s, blowin' on hella tree
Broccoli and collard greens (Collard greens)
It don't matter to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's party like the '70s, blowin' on hella tree
Broccoli and collard greens (Collard greens)
It don't matter to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's party like the '70s, blowin' on hella tree
Broccoli and collard greens (Collard greens)
It don't matter to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
