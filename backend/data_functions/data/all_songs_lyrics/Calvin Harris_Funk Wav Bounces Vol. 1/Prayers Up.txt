Prayers Up Lyrics
Take a molly like communion (Pop one)
My lil' girl like, "What you doin'?" (Flash one)
I'm just tryna even out my odds (Ride)
Sip and sip 'til I feel like a God (God)
You're my cup overflowin' (You know it, you know it)
Fucked up and you know it (You know it, you know it)
I swear I feel like I'm floatin' (Let's ride)
Feel like everybody knows it (Ride)

Yeah, I'm up, yeah, I'm up, yah (Yah)
Everybody must know it (Ooh)
Yeah, I'm up, yeah, I'm up, yah (Yah, yah)
Tell the world, yeah, I'm floatin' (It's lit)
They ain't think I'd ever go and flex like this
Never had plans on gettin' less than this
My God, I know what a blessing is
Thank God, I know what a blessing is

Prayers up
Whole squad sending prayers up
Purple drank in my prayer cup
Whole squad sending prayers up
Purple drank in my prayer cup
Whole squad sending prayers up
My God, I know what a blessing is
Thank God, I know what a blessing is (yah)
Smokin' loud, like to pour lean (Pour lean)
Luxury wheels that you know we in (Know we in)
Mama said she wants me in the church (Praise God)
Before the day they put me in a hearse (Thank God)
But I just feel like God when the liquor hit (Straight up)
If only God can judge me, then I'm innocent (Straight up)
'Cause every time I'm adding up my dividends (Yah)
At the same time I add my blessings up (Yeah)

Yeah, I'm up, yeah, I'm up, yah (Straight up)
Everybody must know it (Straight up)
Yeah, I'm up, yeah, I'm up, yah (Yah)
Tell the world, yeah, I'm floatin' (Ooh)
They ain't think I'd ever go and flex like this (Ooh)
Never had plans on gettin' less to this
My God, I know what a blessing is (Ooh)
Thank God, I know what a blessing is (Ooh)

Prayers up
Whole squad sending prayers up (Prayers up)
Purple drank in my prayer cup (Prayer cup)
Whole squad sending prayers up
Purple drank in my prayer cup (Ooh, ah)
Whole squad sending prayers up (Yah-e-yah)
My God, I know what a blessing is (Yeah)
Thank God, I know what a blessing is (Yah)
Straight up, up, alright
Straight up, yah
It's lit, busy, busy, busy, busy
Alright, ooh
Straight up, yah, yah
Yeah, I'm up, yah7Embed
