Making Believe LyricsMaking believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
Still I'll always dream, I'll never own you
Making believe, it's all I can do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe
Making believe I never lost you
But my happy hours, I find are so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe, what else can I do?
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believeEmbed
