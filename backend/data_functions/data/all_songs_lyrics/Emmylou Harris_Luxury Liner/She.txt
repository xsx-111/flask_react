She Lyrics
She, she came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten by everyone
And she, she worked and she slaved so hard
A big old field was her backyard in the delta sun

Oh, but she sure could sing
Oh, she sure could sing

Then he, looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided he'd help her some
And he didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty
For deep inside his heart, he knew she was the only one

My but she sure could sing
My my, she sure could sing

She had faith and she had believing
Led all the people together in a-singing
And she prayed every night to the Lord up above
Hallelujah, oh hallelujah
They would walk singing songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure she'd have to go away
And she never knew what a life was to give her
Never had to worry about it for one single day

Ah but she sure could sing
My my, but she sure could sing
Oh she sure could singEmbed
