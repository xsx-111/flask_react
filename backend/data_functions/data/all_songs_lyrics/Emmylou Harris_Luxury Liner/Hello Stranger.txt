Hello Stranger Lyrics
Hello stranger, put your loving hand in mine
Hello stranger, put your loving hand in mine
You are a stranger and you're a friend of mine

Get up, rounder, let a working girl lay down
Get up, rounder, let a working girl lay down
You are a rounder and you're all out and down

Now every time I ride the six and four streetcars
Every time I ride the six and four streetcars
I can see my baby peeping through the bars

Well, he bowed his head and he waved both hands at me
He bowed his head and he waved both hands at me
He's prison bound and longing to be free

Well, I'll see you when your troubles are like mine
I'll see you when your troubles are like mine
Yes, I'll see you when you haven't got a dime

Weeping like a willow and moaning like a dove
Weeping like a willow and moaning like a dove
There's a man up country that I really love
Well hello stranger, put your loving hand in mine
Hello stranger, put your loving hand in mine
You are a stranger and you're a friend of mineEmbed
