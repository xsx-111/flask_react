When I Stop Dreaming Lyrics
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever have wanted to die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone new
And you asked me if I could forget

When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds
But you can't teach my heart to forget

When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving youEmbed
