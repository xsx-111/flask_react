Luxury Liner Lyrics
Luxury liner, forty tons of steel
No one in this whole wide world knows the way I feel
I've been a long lost soul for a long, long time
Yeah, I've been around
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind
You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do I

Well, I'm the kind of girl
Who likes to make a living running around
Yeah, and I don't need a stranger
To tell me that my baby's let me down
You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do I

Luxury liner, forty tons of steel
If I don't find my baby now I guess I never will
I've been a long lost soul for a long, long time
Yeah, I've been around
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind
You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do I

Luxury liner, forty tons of steel
No one in this whole wide world knows the way I feel
I've been a long lost soul for a long, long time
Yeah, I've been around
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind
You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do IEmbed
