Tulsa Queen Lyrics
I heard the train in the Tulsa night
Calling out my name, looking for a fight
Well she's come a long, long way
Got a longer way to go
So tell me how a train from Tulsa
Has got a right to know

Well she sings a song so sad and high
And the Tulsa Queen don't ever lie
And she don't care where she goes
Don't care where she's been
And the Tulsa Queen ain't crying
Because I won't see you again
Hey hey hey

And I want to ride like a Tulsa Queen
Calling out to you like she calls to me
As far away from Tulsa as these ten wheels can be

Lately I speak your name too loud
Each time it comes up in a crowd
And I know it when I do
The Tulsa Queen and you are goneEmbed
