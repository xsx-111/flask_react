Night Flyer Lyrics
The window is open, so why don't you fly?
Could it be you have lost all the yearning to try?
Your cage is a prison, they've kept you so long
But wings are for flying and the throat for a song

So fly like an eagle and land like a dove
Go find all the places you must have dreamed of
Fly away with your troubles and drop them somewhere
And if you're only dreaming, I don't really care

They won't even miss you or ask where you've been
They'll feed you and listen for a song now and then
Fly over the mountain and come back to me
And tell in your song what it's like to be free

So fly like an eagle and land like a dove
Go find all the places you must have dreamed of
Fly away with your troubles and drop them somewhere
And if you're only dreaming, I don't really care

God gave us the places to labor and strive
But if living ain't nothing but staying alive
Then give me the dying, if that's what you found
Don't sing on my grave or drop flowers on the ground
For I'll fly like and eagle and land like a dove
I'll find all the places that I have dreamed of
Fly away with my troubles and drop them somewhere
And if I'm only dreaming, I don't really care
And if I'm only dreaming, I don't really careEmbed
