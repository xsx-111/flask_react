Lolita LyricsMusic by Suzanne Vega and Mitchell Froom
Lolita
Almost grown
Lolita
Go on home
Hey girl
Don't be a dog all your life
Don't beg for
Some little crumb of affection
Don't try
To be somebody's wife
So young
You need a word of protection
Lolita
Almost grown
Lolita
Go on home
Hey girl
I've been where you are standing
Leaning in the doorway
In your mother's black dress
So hungry
For the one understanding
Looking for a token of
Blood or tenderness
Lolita
Almost grown
Lolita
Go on home
Lolita...Embed
