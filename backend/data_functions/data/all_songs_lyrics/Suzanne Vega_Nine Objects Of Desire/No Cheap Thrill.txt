No Cheap Thrill LyricsAnte up. And don't be shy
Who is that man who is catching my eye?
What's underneath all of the deadpan face?
Sitting so pretty with a criminal grace?
Lamebrain Pete wants to Spit in the Sea
He's got a cool hand but it isn't for me
Butcher Boy thinks he'll be splitting the pot
But I've seen what he's got and it isn't a lot
(When deuces are wild you can follow the queen
I'd go too except I know where she's been.)
I'll see you, I'll call you, I'll raise you
But it's no cheap thrill
It will cost you, cost you, cost you
Anything you have to pay
I limit the straddles, and you shuffle and deal
When will the dealer reveal how he feels?
Is the lucky beginner just a five-card stud?
Is this winning streak going to be nipped in the bud?
I'll see you, I'll call you, I'll raise you
But it's no cheap thrill
It will cost you, cost you, cost you
Anything you have to pay
I'll match you, I'll bet you, I'll play you
But it's no cheap thrill
It will cost you, cost you, cost you
Anything you have to payEmbed
