Headshots LyricsThe sign said "Headshots"
And that was all
A picture of a boy
And a number you could call
Two eyes in the shade
A mouth so sad and small
It's strange the way a shadow
Can fall across the wall
And make the difference
In what you see
Ah...
He's just a poster, but
He's everywhere
A face under a street lamp
Ripped and hanging in the air
Turn the corner
And he's still there
Watching all the people
Who are passing unaware
Is there a judgement
In what he sees?
Ah...
On a day
As cold
And gray
As today...
The sign says "Headshots"
It's all I see
A boy becomes a picture
Of guilt and sympathy
And so I think of you
In memory
Of the days we were together
And I knew that you loved me
That was the difference
In what we see
But that's history...
Ah...Embed
