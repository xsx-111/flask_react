Stockings LyricsI don't care for tights, she says
And does not tell me why
She hikes her skirt above her knee
Revealing one brown thigh
"I see", I say, and wonder at
Her slender little fingers
How cleverly they pull upon
The threads of recent slumbers

Do you know where friendship ends
And passion does begin?
It's between the binding of
Her stockings and her skin
Oh yeah
She stayed up so late I thought
She'd ask me to go dance
But something in the way she laughed
Told me I had no chance
The fiction in her family
Was that she was never nice
I'd say she was very
I just did not see the price
Do you know where friendship ends
And passion does begin?
When the gin and tonic
Makes the room begin to spin
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
There may be attraction here
But it will never flower
So I'm assigned to read her mind, now
In this witching hour
Here's no game for those who claim
To be easily bruised
But how can I complain
When she's so easily amused?

Do you know where friendship ends
And passion does begin?
(When she does not show you
The way out on the way in)
It's between the binding
Of her stockings and her skin
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeahEmbed
