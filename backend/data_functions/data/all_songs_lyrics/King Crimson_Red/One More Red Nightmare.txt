One More Red Nightmare Lyrics
Pan American nightmare
Ten thousand feet fun-fair
Convinced that I don't care
Safe as houses I swear
I was just sitting musing
The virtues of cruising
When altitude dropping
My ears started popping

One more red nightmare

Sweat beginning to pour down
My neck as I turned round
I heard fortune shouting
Get off of this outing
A farewell swan song â€” see
You know how turbulence can be
The stewardess made me
But the captain forbade me

One more red nightmare
Reality stirred me
My angel had heard me
The prayer had been answered
A reprieve had been granted
The dream was now broken
Though rudely awoken
Really safe and sound
Asleep on the Greyhound

One more red nightmare4Embed
