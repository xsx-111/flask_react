Starless Lyrics
Sundown dazzling day
Gold through my eyes
But my eyes turned within
Only see

Starless and
Bible black
Old friend charity
Cruel twisted smile
And the smile signals emptiness
For me

Starless and
Bible black
Ice blue silver sky
Fades into grey
To a grey hope that all yearns
To be
Starless and
Bible black
