Judy Says (Knock You in the Head) LyricsJudy says she's gonna knock you in the head tonight
Judy says she's gonna knock you in the head tonight
Judy says she's gonna knock you in the head
You'd wanna watch out or you'll wind up dead
Judy says she's gonna knock you in the head tonight
Suzie's gonna give you a hot shot tonight
Suzie's gonna give you a hot shot tonight
Suzie's gonna give you a hot shot
You're off to heaven with a thanks a lot
Suzie's gonna give you a hot shot tonight
But, don't you worry 'bout me baby
Don't you worry
Your money's safe from me well it'll be alright
Alright -Embed
