Destroy LyricsWell, you wanna get to meet her
Cos she looks like your kid sister
And when you tell her that you love her
She tells you to get lost forever
You’re gonna destroy somebody
You’re gonna destroy some city
Well, you might just blow up the world
You go looking for some job
And the man tells you to push off
You go looking for another
There’s murder in your heart
You wanna destroy somebody
You wanna destroy some city
Well, you might just blow up the world
You wanna get your hands on the future
Cos you’re mad at somebody
Cos you’re mad of somebody
Cos you’re mad of some honey
C’mon!
You wanna destroy somebody
You wanna destroy some city
Well, you might just blow up the world
Destroy - Gonna kill your mother
Destroy - Gonna kill your father
Destroy - Gonna kill your sister
Destroy - Gonna kill your brother
Destroy - I’m gonna blow up the house
Destroy - I’m gonna blow up the city
Destroy - I’m gonna blow up the world
