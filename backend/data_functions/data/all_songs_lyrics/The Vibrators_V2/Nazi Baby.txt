Nazi Baby LyricsWell I been looking for a little girl
Well, I’ve been searching all around the world
And when I’ve found her I’m gonna hold her tight
I said I’m gonna be your Nazi baby
Gonna make you feel alright, alright

And when I find her I’m gonna hold her tight
I said I’m gonna be your Nazi baby
Gonna make you feel alright, alright
