24 Hour People LyricsHe's having a good time
But he's on the dole
He never has no money
But he's into rock 'n' roll
An' you know he's great
You know he's gonna make it
So you, don'tcha stand around and hate it
Cos he's 24 hour people
Yeah he ain't no 9 to 5
I said he's 24 hour people
Won't take that same old jive
You know that she is living
In the fallout zone
Of new wave music
An' a broken home
But she’s got a young money
And she’s got a young mind
So mister, don’t you treat her unkind
Cos she's 24 hour people
She ain't no 9 to 5
I said she's 24 hour people
Won't take that same old jive
They're living in the city
They know the whole thing's trash
They don't want their new sub-culture
Messed around for cash
An' you know they’re great
You know they’re gonna make it
So you, don'tcha stand around and hate it
Cos they’re 24 hour people
Yeah, they ain't no 9 to 5
I said they’re 24 hour people
Won't take that same old jive
I said they’re 24 hour people
C’mon, c’mon - They’re 24 hour people
C’monEmbed
