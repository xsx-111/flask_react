Public Enemy No. 1 LyricsIt’s a hard hard world
Now you ought to know
And you with your position
Got nowhere to go
You run around, but you get nothing done
You never ever know what’s going on
Public enemy - number one
Now you want some fun
No room for doubt
Life is a vicious circle
You better work it out
You run around, but you get nothing done
You never ever know what’s going on
Public enemy - number one
You can take a tip from me
Don’t need no song and dance
You can take a tip from me
I need…
It’s a hard hard world
Now you ought to know
And you with your position
Got nowhere to go
You run around, but you get nothing done
You never ever know what’s going on
Public enemy - number one
Public enemy - number oneEmbed
