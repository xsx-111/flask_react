Pure Mania LyricsYou're the psychotic daughter of a psychotic mother
Your father was a megalomaniac
You've got an insane brother
Your nurse committed suicide
When you tore her off strip
You carry a shooter to parties 'cos you think it's hip
But it's a pure mania
It stopped being a game
When you found it would take you to the asylum again
Well your uncle was a rich man
But he also was a thief
His sister was a dyke thing who went out with girls to get relief
You come on with your "how do you do?"
Honey I need a drink before I can look at you
But it's a pure mania
It stopped being a game
When you found it would take you to the asylum again
Well your grandmother was into homicide just for kicks
And your grandfather put people's eyes out with a pointed stick
Your whole family seems to be round the bend
If I got hitched up with you it'd be the livin' end
But it's a pure mania
It stopped being a game
When you found it would take you to the asylum again
Well you may not have an asylum
But you sure got 9.00 to 5.00
You'd better go and find a doctor
See if you're aliveEmbed
