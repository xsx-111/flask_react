Feel Alright LyricsAlright
Feel alright, feel alright
I've been hanging round with sluts night after night
Same old news is goin' round and round again
Same red blood is pumpin' in my veins
And -
Aah honey makes me feel so good
It's a bit impersonal but it's okay
See you tomorrow babe but see if I care
Aah honey will you be there
Here I am, here I am
Don't wanna talk about it gonna get it while I can
I've got this thing about the mentally derranged
Hey babe are you lookin' for a change
And -
Aah honey makes me feel so good
It's a bit impersonal but it's okay
See you tomorrow babe but see if I care
Aah honey will you be there
(Solo)
