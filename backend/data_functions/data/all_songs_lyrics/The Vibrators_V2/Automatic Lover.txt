Automatic Lover LyricsAutomatic lover (x4)
Here she comes she's crazy
But she knows the scene
She carries an automatic pistol
But she ain't got no magazine
Run for cover, run for cover
She's the kinda thing I was warned of by my mother
Well here I am
Outta my brain
Everything's comin'
Back round again
Well there you are
Movin' real real fast
It's a long long night
I don't think you're gonna last
Automatic in her hand
She wants to wear the pants
There's something wrong here honey
Won'tcha give me half a chance
You talk about
This or that glory
But me honey
I'm a different story
When you get mad
An' start countin' up to ten
I'm outta that door
An' on the streets againEmbed
