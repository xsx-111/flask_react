Troops Of Tomorrow LyricsWe're troops of tomorrow
We're hangin' round today
We're playin' tough music
'Cos it's hard times honey
We need a new solution
We want it quick
We're gettin' frustrated
It's makin' us sick
We ain't got a bright future
We bought it on the never-never
Don't wanna be city prisoners
We ain't gonna live forever
We gotta stop that dreamin'
We gotta pick up that gun
I said we're troops of tomorrow
We got a new vision
We're troops of tomorrow (x4)
Left right, left right, etcEmbed
