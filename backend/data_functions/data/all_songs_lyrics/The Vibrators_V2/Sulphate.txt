Sulphate LyricsThere he goes
He’s running out of time
He gets so completely wrecked up
Happens all the time
He’s up all night
He’s up all day
And when he’s coming down
You better stay out of his way
He ain’t no commie, he ain't National Front
He’s into medicine, that’s all he wants
He’s gone
He ran out of time
He got so completely wrecked up
Happens all the time
He ain’t no commie, hе ain't National Front
He’s into medicine, that’s all hе wants
He’s gone
He ran out of time
He got so completely wrecked up
Into heaven he comes
Now he’s up there with the angels
He’s flying really high
I bet right now he’s talking with Jesus
Way up there in the sky
And, ooh he’s gone
He ran out of time
He got so completely wrecked up
Into heaven he comesEmbed
