Wake Up LyricsThere’s too much talk
There’s too much TV
There’s too much going down
Well, it’s confusing me
So wake up
Wake up
To the 20th century
Well, there’s plenty other boys
We make a lot of noise
We’re getting pretty vicious
We’re gonna smash up all your toys
So wake up
Wake up
To the 20th century
Well I believe I’ve had enough
Yeah I’m getting ripped off
Don’t you stand around and check it
Just go on and get it
So wake up
Wake up
To the 20th century
Out in the car
Sitting in a traffic jam
It’s always happening
Yeah, again and again and again
So wake up
Wake up
To the 20th century
Well I believe I’ve had enough
Yeah I’m getting ripped off
Don’t you stand around and check it
Just go on and get it
Wake up to the 20th century
