War Zone LyricsFeels like 1945
Put your hands above your head if you wanna stay alive
You think carrying guns is fun
I got the final solution, got the neutron bomb
Well you broken down low-life take your hands off me
Or I'll give you the brightest sunset that your ever gonna see
Honey have I got a surprise for you
Stick my bayonet right through you
Well it's a warzone baby, ooh yeah
Well it's a warzone baby, ain't you glad it's for real
It's a warzone baby, ooh yeah
Well it's a warzone baby, movin' in for the kill
I'm like an atomic reactor honey that's all
But you'd better watch out 'cos I'm going critical
Well it's a warzone baby, ooh yeah
It's a warzone baby, alright
Well it's a warzone baby, I know what I'm talking about
Well it's a warzone baby, ooh yeah
Well it's a warzone baby, aaagh!
Well it's a warzone baby, c'mon c'mon
Well it's a warzone baby, ooh yeah
Well it's a warzone babyEmbed
