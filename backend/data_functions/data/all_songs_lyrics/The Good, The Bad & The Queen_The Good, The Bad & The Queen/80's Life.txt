80's Life Lyrics
Where do I see the light?
It's all gone dead in a way
'Cos more or less I get on by
My made up thing on the day
Oh Lord, can a stone
Be ballast for an aching soul?
Just learning how to know your mind
No hiding out on the way back

To get out before I'm feeling
You just blow them all away
It's eighties' life
But it all looks good on you

Bop, bop, bop-bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop-bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop-bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop-bop bop
Bop, bop, bop-bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop-bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop-bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
Suddenly police run out
Now the hope is found in a sound
'Cos I don't want to live a war
That's got no end in our time

Call it living in this country
Calling it missing dawn patrol
It's eighties' life
And it's all gone right on you1Embed
