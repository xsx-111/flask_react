Kingdom of Doom Lyrics
Friday night
In the Kingdom of Doom
Oh, ravens fly
Across the moon
All in now
There's a noise in the sky
Following all the rules
And not asking why

When the sunset wheel begins
Turning into the night
I see everything in black and white and then

Drink all day 'cos the country's at war
You'll be falling off the palace wall
I can't be any more than I say
Oh in the flood, we all get washed away

When the sunset wheel begins
Turning into the night
I see everything in black and white become
A love song for the collaboration
You and me will never be undone
We'll let it blow away1Embed
