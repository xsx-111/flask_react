The Good, The Bad And The Queen LyricsMoving uptown
But I know it's the path I should be
Streets are all quiet
And no one saying nothing at all
Then the sun came out of the clouds
And charged up the satellites
And we all got our energy back
And started talking again
It's the blessed routine
For The Good The Bad And The Queen
Just moving out of dreams
With no physical wounds at all
Don't kick the crackheads off the green
They're a political party
And the kids are never gonna be tired
'Coz everything has so slightly
Everything has so slightly come
Everything has so slightly comeEmbed
