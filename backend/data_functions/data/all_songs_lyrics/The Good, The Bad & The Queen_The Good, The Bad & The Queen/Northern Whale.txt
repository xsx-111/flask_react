Northern Whale Lyrics
Another wave crashed over you
It put you in a spell
On a cold place you know well
It pulls you further out to sea
Under the lights at Tilbury
I still love your melody

In a tied end town
Everyone hallucinating on you
But a northern whale wouldn't leave you
Until all england's tears are done
And the day comes, we move on endlessly

They only hear you in a dream
Lying by a sad machine
Sing on, love your melody

In a tied end town
Everyone hallucinating with you
But a northern whale wouldn't leave you
Until all our tears are done
And the day comes, we move on endlessly2Embed
