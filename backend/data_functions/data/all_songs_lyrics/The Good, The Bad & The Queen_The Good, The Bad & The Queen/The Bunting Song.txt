The Bunting Song Lyrics
Pull out the bunting
She made 'em one by one
Hang 'em in the trees
Or they'll blow away
Move to the country
The town has told its tale
You'll be forgotten
When the autumn leaves, they fell

And the whole place didn't look the same that night
They put a party on and waited
For the sunlight to recall
All the days are a ticking on

Bye Baby Bunting
All England wants you home
Away in the hills
Where the wild things, they roam
So I'll never know why
She made 'em one by one
Hanging in the trees
'Til a breeze, it comes
And the country didn't look the same that day
They put a party on
But she just sailed away, on a dawn
To a day - are a ticking onEmbed
