Nature Springs Lyrics
Over Lord Hills Bridge we must go
Where the hearts burn at night and the guns unload
Oceanographers are charting the rise of the seas
Today is a submarine setting course to a land under me

Ohh, ohh-oh

Nature springs are lost in a war
The imperious demands are the local law
It is pulling us down to the Emperor's Gate
Everyone is a submarine, looking for a dream far away

Ohh, ohh-ohEmbed
