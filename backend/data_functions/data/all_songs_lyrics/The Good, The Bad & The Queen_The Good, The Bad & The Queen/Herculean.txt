Herculean Lyrics
Standing on the dark canal
By the gas works
Celebrate the ghosts gone by
When all love hurts

And the medicine man here twenty four seven
You can get it fast in Armageddon
Everyone on their way to Heaven
Slowly

The call for prayer is common around here
In the morning
We wash our faces, go to work
There is no warning

That it all gets better when life is straight
It's bigger than you, the welfare state
And we'll keep singing it's not too late
For youEmbed
