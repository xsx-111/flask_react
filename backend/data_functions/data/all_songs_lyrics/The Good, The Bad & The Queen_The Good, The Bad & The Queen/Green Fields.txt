Green Fields Lyrics
I wrote this song years ago
Late at night somewhere
On the Goldhawk Road
I was never sure how or why
Before the war and the tidal wave
Engulfed us all, it's true
How the world has changed
And I was learning how to change with you

We saw the green fields
Turn into stone, such lonely homes
All in the badman dream
He is awake, is a dream

The darkest hour song had gone
It passed among people I hardly knew
I was losing it all the time
She stayed with me and found me out
And above all things I've learnt
It's the honesty that secures
The bond in the heart

We saw the green fields
Turn into stone, such lonely homes
All in the badman dream
He is awake, is a dream
All we ever need is destiny
All we have is dreamsEmbed
