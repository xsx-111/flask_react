History Song Lyrics
Come the day
You see the sun
Hit the arch
A history song

If you don't know it now
Then you will do
If you don't know it now
Then you will do

Shiver 'cross
The estuary
Sunday's lost
In melancholy

If you don't know it now
Then you will do
If you don't know it now
Then you will do

A storm upstream's
Far away
The hangers-on
Save the day
If you don't know it now
Then you will do
If you don't know it now
Then you will do
And if you don't feel it now
Then you will do
If you don't know it now
Then you will do

La la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la
La la la, la la la, la
La la la, la la la, la la
La la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la laEmbed
