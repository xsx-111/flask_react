The Messiah Will Come Again LyricsJust a smile, just a glance
The Prince of Darkness
He just walked past
There's been a lot of people
And they've had a lot to say
But this time, I'm gonna tell it my way
There was a town,
There was a strange little town, they called "The World"
It was a lonely, lonely little town
'Til one day a stranger appeared
And their hearts rejoiced
And the sad little town was happy again
But there was some that doubted
They disbelieved so they mocked him
And that stranger, he went away
Now the sad little town that was sad yesterday
It's a lot sadder today
I walked in a lot of places I never should have been
But I know that the Messiah, he will come again
