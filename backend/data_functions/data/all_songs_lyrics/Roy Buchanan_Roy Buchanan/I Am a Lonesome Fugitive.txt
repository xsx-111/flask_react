I Am a Lonesome Fugitive LyricsI'd like to settle down but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rollin' stone
Down every road there's always one more city
And I'm on the run the highway is my home
I raised a lot of cain back in my younger days
My mama used to pray my crops would fail
Now I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways
It's outrun the law or spend my life in jail
I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rollin' stone
Down every road there's always one more city
And I'm on the run the highway is my home
I'd like to take you with me but can't afford the luxury
A fugitive must be a rollin' stone
You'd only slow me down and they'd catch up with me
For he who travels fastest goes alone
I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rollin' stone
Down every road there's always one more city
And I'm on the run the highway is my home
I'm on the run the highway is my homeEmbed
