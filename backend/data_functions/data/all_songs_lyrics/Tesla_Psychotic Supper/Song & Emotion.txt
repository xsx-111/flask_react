Song & Emotion LyricsI see him there most every day
A lonely man and his guitar
In his eyes I see the pain
All the faces and the places
All the trouble that he'd seen
There was a time
There was a day
They'd come from miles around
They all knew his name
But day's gone by are gone
Now only memories remain
Then he starts to play
Suddenly the pain slowly fades away
Tattered, torn and frayed
There's a place within his heart
He'd always saved for song and emotion
Know he's got to his dyin' day
Song and emotion
You can hear him play
You can still hear him say
Better run for cover 'cause it looks like rain again!
And now his life is but a shadow of his dreams
The calm is over, been stormin' for years
He turns and leans his shoulder to the wind
Lost again!
All alone on his way to the top
Somehow, somewhere, something was lost
Through it all he knew his only friend was
Song and emotion
Know he's got to his dyin' day
Song and emotion
Where are they now, where are those people who promised him his dreams?
Where are they now for this lonely creature on the streets?
Broken, humbled by the cold reality
Life at the top ain't always what it seems
Oh, better run for cover, 'cause it looks like rain again
You'd best be careful of what you dream
Of what you dream!
Song and emotion
Song and emotion
Song and emotion
