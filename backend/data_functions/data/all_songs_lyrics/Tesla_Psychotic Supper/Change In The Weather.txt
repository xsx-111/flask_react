Change In The Weather LyricsPut this in your pipe and smoke it!
We’re the younger generation
And we’re here to face the day
Heard all across the nation
And we got so much to say
Ready for a change
Ready for a change in the weather
Ooh, yeah!
We will keep the fire burnin’
And this big wheel will keep spinnin’ ‘round and ‘round
And around
Yeah!
We’re the children of the sixties
Watched the seventies go bye
Now, we made it thru the eighties
My, my how time does fly
Just around the corner
Is a brand new century
Now, we’ll keep the fire burnin’
And this old world will keep spinnin’ ‘round and ‘round
And around
Yes, we’ll keep the fire burnin’
And this old world will keep turnin’ ‘round and ‘round!
A-turnin’ ‘round and ‘round, yeah
I think we’re ready for a change in the weather (Ready for a change in the weather)
I think we’re ready for a change of scene
Ready for a change in the weather (Ready for a change in the weather)
I’m ready for a change for you and me
Ah, yeah, yeah! Ooh
(Solo)
Really do
I think we’re ready for a change in the weather (Ready for a change in the weather)
I think we’re ready for a change of scene
Ready for a change in the weather (Ready for a change in the weather)
I’m ready for a change, for a change for you and me
I think we’re ready for a change in the weather (Ready for a change in the weather)
I think we’re ready for a change of scene
Ready for a change in the weather (Ready for a change in the weather)
I’m ready for a change
For you and me
Just around the corner
Oh, is a brand new century (I’m ready)
I’m waitin’
I’m ready! (We’re ready!)
Yeah!Embed
