Freedom Slaves LyricsI pledge no allegiance to your flag
I feel I got me some damn good reasons for feelin' bad
Way they take away ev'ry mother's son
If you want freedom now, it's got to be won
It's only bullets. It's just a gun
Ain't gon' hurt no one
I don't know what they must be thinkin'
Makin' decisions on a hard night's drinkin'
Momma, gon' take your little boy
Gonna make him 'to a man
Make him a stranger in a strange land
(Chorus:)
Freedom slaves
What have you done
Freedom slaves
With ev'ry mother's son?
Freedom slaves
Can't ya see that we're all freedom slaves?
Freedom slaves
What have you done?
Freedom slaves
And all for number one
Freedom slaves
It's clear to see that we're all freedom slaves
No sign of justice nor liberty
By takin' an Indian Nation, 'cause they was all that we wanted to be
All good people from the Kingdom of the Sun
Welcome to freedom. Now, there's work to be done
It's only natural to know it's wrong
Why did it go so long?
I don't know what next they'll be killin'
Rapin' the land with pollution and spillin'
Here's to the tired, to the hungry, to the helpless and the poor
Is there no glory for blisters and sores?
(Chorus)
Who are those people?
So patriotically sittin' back of tables
POn their asses, lickin' labels, tryin' to change me
You'd think the way they act, the way they carry on
You'd think that I was the devil's Seventh Son
But it's only words. It's just a song
Ain't gonna hurt no one
(Chorus)
Freedom slaves
Freedom slaves
Freedom slaves
Attention!
About Face!
March!
Left, right, left, right, left, right
Your momma, she was a....(fade out)Embed
