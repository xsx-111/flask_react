Call It What You Want LyricsI'm in love with a lady
And I know the lady's in love with me
And she knows how to always be there
That's why she's willin' and ready
But now and then, every once in a while
Something inside of me, maybe inside of her...
Have you ever had one of those days
Where it all is going wrong
And it just can't seem to get along?
But through it all you know you're gonna make it
Call it true love
Call it not meant to be
You can call it anything at all, you see
Call it what you want
It's all the same to me
Music means a lot to me
Like love, I make it when I can
All I am is all I'll ever be
And that's just a boy from Texarkana
But now and then oh, but once in a while
They start treating me like some kind of superstar
Need I mention, at the end of the day
What matters most of all
It's not where you're at
Or where you're comin' from
When all is said and done
You can call it...
Heavy metal, hard-core, pop, punk, or thrash
You can call it anything, it don't matter to me
Call it what you want
It's all music to me
Call it communism, call it free
Some call the ocean what some call the sea
Call it what you want
That doesn't change a thing for me
Not a thing...
Baby's lyin' in the cradle
Universe is all within his reach
Wearin' rags or mink and sable
Needs a guidin' hand or it's out on the streets
Now momma's out
She's never at home
Daddy's taking care of business
He's out on the road
It's rainin' cats and dogs
But the child within us all must face the storm
Call it individuality
Some call it fate, others reality
Call it what you want
It doesn't matter to me
Call it communism, call it free
Some call the ocean what some call the sea
Call it what you want
That doesn't change a thing for me
Not a thing!Embed
