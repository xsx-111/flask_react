Time LyricsTime
You've got to wake up ev'rybody
Seven-thirty o'clock
It's time to go to work
A-send the young to school
Gonna teach them the golden rule
Talk about things that they don't wanna know about
Now teacher, teacher, can't you see
I'm tired and I need some sleep
I don't wanna hear whatcha gotta say
About arithmetic or history
All that jive don't mean a thing to me
It's all a waste of time
I ain't got no time for doin' this
Ain't got no time for doin' that
Ain't got no time for that at all, no!
I ain't got no time for messin' 'round
For funky bullshit goin' down
Just time for rock-n-roll. Oh yeah
I just got time to rock-n-roll
Why now, must they take my favorite song
Turn around and say it's wrong, when I know it's right?
Now, why don't they just leave it alone
'Cause it's only rock-n-roll, but I like it!!
Now, listen Mrs. Politician
Don't ya try to tell me how to sing my song
Tell me, who do you think you are?!
Who do you think you are?!
I ain't got no time for messin' 'round
For funky bullshit goin' down
No time for that at all, no!
I ain't got no time for Uncle Sam
Taxin' my money, tax my land
Just time for rock-n-roll, woh yeah!
I just got time to rock-n-roll!
Tell 'em, Frankie!!
