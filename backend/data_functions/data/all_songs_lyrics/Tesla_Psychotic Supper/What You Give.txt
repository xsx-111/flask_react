What You Give LyricsWho's the one that makes you happy?
Or maybe, who's the one always on your mind?
And who is the reason you're living for?
Who's the reason for your smile?
I feel so lonely and I know I'm not the only one
To ever feel this way
I love you so much that I think I'm goin' insane
I'm goin' crazy, Outta my head
Goin' crazy, Outta my head
Can't think about nothin' but your good, good love
And what you give
Everyone needs somebody
And you know
Everybody needs someone
Well then I guess it's true
Everybody needs a special kind of love
And you're the only one I'm thinking of
You mean the world to me
You are my only
I feel so lonely and I know I'm not the only one
To carry on this way
I love you so much I lose track of time
Lose track of the days
I'm goin' outta my head
Goin' crazy, Outta my head
Can't think about nothin' but your good, good love
And what you give
It's not what you got, It's what you give
It ain't the life you choose, it's the life you live
It's only what you give
It's not what you got
But the life you live
It's the life you live
And you're the one that makes me happy
Oh yeah baby
And you're the one always on my mind
Well then I guess it's true
You are my reason
My one and only
That I've been living for
Why can't forever be
Forever and nothing more?
I feel so lonely and I know I'm not the only one
To ever feel this way
I love you so much I lose track of time
Lose track of the days
I'm goin' outta my head
Goin' crazy, Outta my head
Can't think about nothin' but your good, sweet love
And what you give
It's not what you got, It's what you give
It ain't the life you choose, It's the life you live
It's not what you got, It's what you give
And it ain't what it's not, But what it is
Only what you give
It's not what you got, But what you give
Only what you give
It's only what you give, yeah
Can't get enough girl, of that sweet lovin' baby
What you giveEmbed
