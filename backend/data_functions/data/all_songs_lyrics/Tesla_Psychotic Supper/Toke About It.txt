Toke About It LyricsRolling!
Ow!
Got me a woman, won't toke about it
Says she doesn't need it, she can do without it
If I try to push it, she'll say shove it!
Baby if ya tried it maybe you might like it!
Even love it!
Loosen up!
Let's toke it over!
Loosen up!
Let's toke it over!
Always got a problem, she can't lose it
She likes to drive me crazy when she chooses
Baby, if you got it you should use it
Oh, you can play with fire, but just don't abuse it
Just use it
Loosen up!
Let's toke it over!
Loosen up!
Let's toke it over!
Loosen up!
Loosen up!
Let's toke, toke, toke about it
Let's toke, toke, toke about it
Now sticks ‘n' stones'll break your bones
A little tokin' never hurt no one!
Let's toke, toke, toke about it!
Have a toke!
I'm a-tokin' witchoo
Ah, that feels better now
Let's ya feel the groove
Ah, don't stop now
Oh, keep on a-ziggin' and a-zaggin' all over the place
On the bed, on the floor
But then, who knows baby, maybe if we really like it that much
Maybe baby, we can do it some more!
Since we had a toke, no doubt about it, ha ha
Baby's feelin' better, can't live without it
Both our hearts on fire, now we're really smokin'
Mm, all we ever needed was a little tokin'!
Let's toke, toke, toke about it
C'mon! Let's toke, toke, toke about it
Now sticks ‘n' stones'll break your bones
A little tokin' never hurt no one!
Let's toke, toke, toke about it! Ow!
Have a toke!
Let's toke, toke, toke about it
C'mon! Let's toke, toke, toke about it
Let's toke, toke, toke about it
Let's toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, wooh!
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
Toke it, toke it, toke it, toke it, toke it, toke it, wooh!
Toke about it for a little bit!
