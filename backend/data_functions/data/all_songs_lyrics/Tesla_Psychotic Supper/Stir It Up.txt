Stir It Up LyricsEv'rybody wants somethin' for nothin'
Yeah, they all want it fo free
These days, now nothin' cost ya somethin'
No tellin' what it could be
Never happen if ya never try
All the nights awake and the tears we've cried
Could fill the seven seas
So, c'mon, ev'rybody, c'mon, ev'rybody
We got to give ourselves, got to give ourselves a hand
And if we feel it's all a mess, yeah, yeah
Why don't we try a little, try a little love 'n' tenderness
If we got more than comes around, yeah, yeah
Why don't we care a little, share a little
Sure to come back around. Guitar!
Lately everybody's thinkin'
Me, my, only I thinkin' for me
Here lately, everbody's talkin', baby
But we all know that talk is cheap
We can make it happen if we make a try
All the nights awake and the tears we've cried
Could fill the seven seas
So, c'mon, ev'rybody, c'mon, ev'rybody
We gotta give ourselves, gotta give ourselves a hand, yeah
And before it falls apart, yeah, yeah
Why don't we live a little, give a little, straight from the heart
And if this old world gets ya down, yeah, yeah
You gotta pick it up and toss it in the air, kick it all around. Kick it!
I don't even know how I wanna say, but I know what I wanna say
Do you know where I'm comin' from?
As the bass plays on, and still the guitars strum
While the Colonel beats the drum, so the whole band plays along
And the whole world sings a song, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And before it falls apart, yeah, yeah
Live a little, give a little, straight from the heart
If this whole world gets ya down, yeah, yeah
You gotta pick it up and toss it in the air. Kick it all around
And if you don't like the way the music plays, the way it sounds
Hop back in the kitchen, change it all around
Stir it up, baby. Stir it up, baby, stir it up
Stir it up, stir it up, stir it up
Stir it up now, stir it up, baby
Stir it up, baby, stir it up, baby, stir it up
Stir it up, stir it up, stir it up, stir it up
Stir it up now, stir it up, baby. And you know:
Nobody gets somethin' for nothin'
Nobody's gettin' it for free. (Spoken:) But you know
These days now nothin' costs ya somethin', baby
And-a there ain't no tellin what it could be
So stir it up, baby, stir it up, baby
Stir it up, baby, stir it up, baby
Stir, stir it up, baby, stir it up, baby
Oh, U B U and I'll be me, and the world will be freeEmbed
