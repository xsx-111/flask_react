Government Personnel LyricsGo straight to hell
All you government personnel
Sittin' awf'ly well
In your big, white house up on the hill
You say now, give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
Where the deer and antelope play
You can bet your ass we'll blow them all away
Fuck it up until it's bent
Then a-wonder where it went
Thinkin' you was a-heaven sent, ha ha ha
You're nothin' but hell!
Go straight to hellEmbed
