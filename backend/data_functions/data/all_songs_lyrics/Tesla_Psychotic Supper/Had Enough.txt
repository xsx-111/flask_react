Had Enough LyricsMe and the boys are gonna rock tonite
Drinkin' double shots, feelin fine. Mmmm, I like it!
I like the way, the way it makes me feel
Now, I'm in love witcha, Lady Mary Jane
You put my mind at ease, make me feel no pain
Keep takin' me, keep takin' me higher, well, and higher
Light my fire!
Ain't it funny?
'Cause the more I drink, the more I smoke, well, the better she looks
And, honey, that's a whole lot better, whole lot better than before
Lord! 'Cause you look so good. Yes, you look so fine
Let's steal away and blow each other's minds
Come on, baby. Keep takin' me higher. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and higher!
(Chorus:)
I've had enough!
Ah, maybe too, too much
And with a little luck
You know I'll get back up
On my feet again
Ah, too much!
Too much to drink, too much to smoke
I wasn't lookin' when it took a hold on me
And it sure got a hold on me
Oh, and it won't let go. Oh no
I've never been this far before
Have I reached the point, the point of no return?
When will I learn?
(Chorus 2x)
I've had enough!
I've had enough!
Ah, maybe too, too much
I've had enough!Embed
