In the New Year LyricsOh, I’m still living
At the old address
And I’m waiting on the weather
That I know will pass
I know that it’s true
It’s gonna be a good year
Out of the darkness
And into the fire
I tell you I love you
And my heart’s in the strangest place
That’s how it started
And that’s how it ends
Well I know you’re with me
It’s a point of pride
And it’s louder than lightning
In this room of mine
Oh, I’m just like you
I never hear the bad news
And I never will
We won by a landslide
Our troubles are over
My sisters are married to all of my friends
Yeah, that’s how it started
You took your sweet time
And I waited by without complaint
Til all the pipe dreams made me insane
So it’s all over
It’s all over anyhow
You took your sweet time
Finally, I opened my eyes
My friends and my family
They all ask me one thing
“How long will you ramble”
How long will you stay with me
The snow is still falling
I’m almost home
I’ll see you in the new yearEmbed
