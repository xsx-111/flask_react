Seven Years of Holidays (For Stretch) LyricsEugene, I'm lost
The world as we know it is round
Well, I've traveled so far and I'm worn
And I've lived in a suitcase for too long
Eugene, I'm lost
The whole world around us is too small
Seven years of holidays
Cafes, bars and sunny days
We ran around, banged our heads
Never felt no pain
I hope we'll find our peace someday
Until then, these wild nights are no fun
My old friend
My old friend
Oh, someday when this darkness fades
We'll wed our girls and move away
We'll buy some land and build us homes
And no more will we stray
I've traveled so far
I'm done
Eugene, I'm lostEmbed
