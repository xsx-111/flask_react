On the Water LyricsAll the windows are glowing
The branches bending low
The skyline is swinging
Rocking back and forth
Walking down this dirt road
Watching at the sky
It's all I can do
It's all I can do
All the years keep rolling
The decades flying by
But ahh, the days are long
So here's one to the pigeons
The tugboats on the river
Here's one to you
For walking in my shoes, ah
Oh, you know I'd never leave you
No matter how hard I try
You know I'd never leave you
And that's just how it is
Oh, everybody sees right through
Oh, the static
That is, dear, everyone but you
Oh, it's funny to think it through
Everybody... that is, dear, everyone but youEmbed
