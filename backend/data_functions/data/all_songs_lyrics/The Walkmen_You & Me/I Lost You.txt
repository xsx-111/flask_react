I Lost You LyricsDrive on, drive on
The highway bright and long
The river's overflowing
The house's burning down
Drive on, drive on
The engines hummed along
We kiss goodbye and drink up
Some hours before the dawn
We kiss goodbye and drink up
I'll miss you when you're gone
So throw me a line
Throw me a line
My heart's underneath
Aside on our feet
The windows are shaking
And so are my bones
The world's going round
Throw me a rope
A trumpet and a trombone
Still echoing in the hall
And bells ringing out at dawn
So hang on to me
Hang on to me
The world's going round
And time's cutting out
The headlights are swinging all over the road
So throw me a rope
Throw me a rope
I knew you when I was young
The loveliest girl in town
I wish you were still around
Hey
I waited a long time
All for you
I waited a long time
I lost you
I was sleeping in the backseat
When I got home
I was finally reminded
I lost youEmbed
