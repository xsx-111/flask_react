New Country LyricsThe news is all good
And I'm flying higher
I'm back on my own
Don't worry about me
I got no more baggage
I threw all my old things away
I got your letter
Thanks for the offer
I really don't need a thing
Open the door in front of me
The sun is now shining down on me
Meet me as soon as you can
Bring me the money you owe for me
I'm taking my head out of the sand
Oh, maybe I'll go see the world
There's plenty of places to see
Voices I never have heard
Look at the way it ought to be
Oh, I'm on a roll
Oh, I'm on a roll
I know you're still listening to me
Isn't a lot as far as I seeEmbed
