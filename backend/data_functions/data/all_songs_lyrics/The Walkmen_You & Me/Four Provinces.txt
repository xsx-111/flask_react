Four Provinces LyricsI'll see you tonight down at Sophia's place
It's always a good time
The polished mohogany
Gin and cigars
Yeah, come on then
Hey, Leah
Am I getting through
It's one more silver lining for the weekend
Hey, we're here
Am I getting through
The candles in your eyes are still burning
The next time I see you at Sophia's place
We'll fall right back in line
They'll tilt up your glass
In the mirror so clear
Well, c'mon then and be a good friend
Hey, Leah, I'm here to see you
There's one more silver lining
So c'mon then and be a good friend
Hey, Leah
Am I getting through
Your shining eyes are brighter in the moonlight
Every bone in my body
Broken one time or two
Every hour of the long day
Rather spend with you
Every year that I'm living
Got to stick by your side
Sun goes down
Moon comes up
Sky is black and blue
Here I stand
Honey, with youEmbed
