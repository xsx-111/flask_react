If Only It Were True LyricsIf only it were true
I'd go with you
If only it were true
I'd say, I do
And all the things that we do
I could face the day
And all the long night too
If only it were true
My head is all full of dreams
It's nothing new
But baby, dreaming is all
A man can do
So don't come calling for me
Cause baby, my dream ain't through
And when, when I've had enough
Oh, then I'll die in dreams of you
So don't come calling for me
Cause baby, my dream ain't through
And when, when I've had enough
Oh, then I'll die in dreams of youEmbed
