Canadian Girl LyricsYou are the morning
I am the night
I was the only one left at the right time
And only I still call you mine
Only I'm still hanging on
Blown by strong wind, but it/here we fear (?)
All that you said to me is still so very clear
So take my hand
The players in the band
They can always find
Always find some number that we know
You'll miss me when I'm gone
But the happy music will carry on
You are the morning
I am the night
I was the only one left at the right time
And only I still call you mine
Only I'm still hanging onEmbed
