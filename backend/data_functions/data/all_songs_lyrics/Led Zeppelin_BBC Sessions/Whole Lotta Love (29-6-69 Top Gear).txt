Whole Lotta Love (29/6/69 Top Gear) Lyrics
You need coolin', baby, I'm not foolin'
I'm going to send you back to schoolin'
Way down inside, honey, you need it
I'm goin' to give you my love
I'm goin' to give you my love, oh

Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

You've been learnin', baby, I've been yearnin'
All them good times, baby, baby, I've been learnin'
Way, way down inside, honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love, ah
I'm goin' to give you my love, ah, oh

Want a whole lotta love

You've been coolin', baby, I've been droolin'
All the good times, baby, I've been misusin'
Way, way down inside, I'm goin' to give you my love
I'm goin' to give you every inch of my love
Goin' to give you my love, hey, alright, yes, sir

Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

Way down inside, woman, you need love
Shake for me, girl, I want to be your back door man
Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh!
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', babyEmbed
