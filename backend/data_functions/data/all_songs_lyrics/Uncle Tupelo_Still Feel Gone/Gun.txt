Gun LyricsFalling out the window
Tripping on a wrinkle in the rug
Falling out of love, dear
It hurt much worse when you gave up
Just don't tell me which way I oughta run
Or what good I could do anyone
'Cause my heart, it was a gun
But it's unloaded now so don't bother
Climbing up the ladder
Breaking my shin on the very first rung
Waking up the neighbors
It's all right, they understand they're just as dumb
And they don't tell me which way I oughta run
Or what good I could do anyone
'Cause my heart, it was a gun
But it's unloaded now, so don't bother me now, don't bother
Crawling back to you now
I sold my guitar to the girl next door
She asked me if I knew how
I told her "I don't think so anymore"
Don't tell me which way I oughta run
What good could I do anyone
'Cause my heart, it was a gun
But it's unloaded now so don't botherEmbed
