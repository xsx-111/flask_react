Cold Shoulder LyricsIt doesn't matter what you've said
Or what you've done
When you've lost your head
You're looking for a new one
Your heaven looks just like my hell
You're beautiful, as far as I can tell
But your heaven looks just like my hell
Just as I drown
Then you say it's real
So I hold myself down
'Cause I like the way it feels
Your heaven looks just like my hell
Beautiful, as far as I can tell
But your heaven looks just like my hell
How could I have ever needed
Such a cold heart to count on?
And how could I have ever wanted
Such a cold shoulder to cry on?Embed
