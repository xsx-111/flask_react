Nothing LyricsBeen traveling around some
Crossing people's paths
Some, they stand right in your way
Others like to watch you pass
Been trying to memorize
All the different lies
That people must tell themselves
Each night to justify their lives
Don't call it nothing
This might be all we'll ever have
Held myself for ransom
Wanderin' so blind
I found roads less traveled
To take you off my mind
And I told myself I know
Everything I do
I'm just looking for something
To lead me away from you
Don't call it nothing
This might be all we'll ever have
I know it's not enough
To make it sound like more
So I swear if there's a God
To make him sleep on the floor
Been traveling around some
Crossing people's paths
Some, they stand right in your way
Others like to watch you pass
Don't call it nothing
This might be all we'll ever have
I'll ever have, ever haveEmbed
