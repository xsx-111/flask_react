Discarded LyricsThese lines don't work on me
They won't on you
Didn't knew the cards were on the table
Just can't stand to see things turn out wrong
No way to make things right
Never promise anything anymore
It's so goddamn hard to make it work
No easy way out of this one
Always someone or something
To get lost in the shuffle
At least this road leads straight out of here
Adversity is stable
And life in front of you
Discarded, recycled and new
Just can't stand to see things turn out wrong
No way to make things right
Never promise anything anymore
It's so goddamn hard to make it work
No easy way out of this one
Always someone or something
To get lost in the shuffle
At least this road leads straight out of here
Just can't stand to see things turn out wrong
No way to make things right
Never promise anything anymore
Someone or something
To get lost in the shuffle
At least this road leads straight out of here
Too late to go back
Sorry, it needs to be said
But there's really nothing now to doEmbed
