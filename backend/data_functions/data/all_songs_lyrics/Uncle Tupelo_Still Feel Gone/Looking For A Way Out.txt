Looking For A Way Out LyricsWhen you find you can't somehow
Make it like all the rest
You won't need to scrounge around for someone else
Torn between the unknown
And the place that you call home
And the life you want but have never known
There was a time
You could put it out of your mind
Leave it all behind
There was a time
That time is gone
What has life for fifty years
In this town done for you
Except to earn your name and place on a barstool?
You spent your whole life in this county
You've never been out of state
You say, you're gonna make it out before it's too late
There was a time
You could put it out of your mind
Leave it all behind
There was a time
That time is gone
There was a time when nothing seemed to make much sense
That's turned more intense
And all the crutches you've kept around
Now are nowhere to be found
Remember when you didn't have
To look ahead or behind you
There was always something right there to do
But now it's life in some kind
Of trap looking for a way out
Well, you keep moving on, that's what it's all about
There was a time
You could put it out of your mind
Leave it all behind
There was a time
That time is goneEmbed
