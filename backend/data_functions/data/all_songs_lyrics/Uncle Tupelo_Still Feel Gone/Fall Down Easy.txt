Fall Down Easy LyricsDisengaged, we're forsaken now
Communication does suffer
The moral stare of big brother
Not a chance, no compromise
Battling the barrier of belief not to try anymore
Don't want to murder the only memory or hide
Try to accept that it's all worthwhile
When you've been disengaged
Severed from any world that's mine
You can hang the blame on the wall
It'll be a frame around us all
Deluged by stickers and billboards
The conversation turns to war
Never thought it would come down to this
It seems every person for themself
Don't want to murder the only memory or hide
Try to accept that it's all worthwhile
When you've been disengaged
Severed and forsaken
When you've been disengaged
Severed from any world that's mine
More and more makes a hunger for less
You get hurt when you touch the bright lights burning
When you're high, you can fall down easy
Too many years spent trigger happy at times I feel betrayed
I feel that I've been wronged
Suspended in it all, disbelief
Until it seems it just can't go onEmbed
