Watch Me Fall LyricsSome folks find
That their role in life
Is to fail
At everything they try
While other folks see
But not like me
There's one thing
That they're damn good at
So gather 'round, you all
Come around and see
Those who stand tall
Why don't you please
Watch me fall?
The hole is wide
And it's there to divide
It's no one's fault
But it's put there by design
And there's a bridge yet to build
As many men have willed
It stands the weight
Of all those who wish to pass
Gather 'round you all
Come around and see
Those who stand tall
Why don't you please
Watch me fall?Embed
