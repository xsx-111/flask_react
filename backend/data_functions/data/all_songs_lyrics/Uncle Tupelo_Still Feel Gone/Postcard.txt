Postcard LyricsLost sight of ground
Never been so down
Nothing here to stand on
It's a war-weary road
Another faceless tombstone
Nothing here to stand on
Turn to face the wind
May never get out
Forever caught in a spin
No better place to begin
Can't find the phone, can't hear to listen
Can't take along what we're missing
Just as well to write this postcard from hell
And the bar clock says three a.m
Fallout shelter sign above the door
In other words, don't come here anymore
Too many miles between
I heard a dead man scream
Nothing here to stand on
Each and every step
Reeling out more or less
Nothing here to stand on
Turn to face the wind
May never get out
Forever caught in a spin
No better place to begin
Turn to face the wind
May never get out
Forever caught in a spin
No better place to begin
Tried to stay, tried to run
There's never been enough reason
To believe in anyone
This trickle-down theory has left all these pockets empty
And the bar clock says three a.m
Fallout shelter sign above the door
In other words, don't come here anymoreEmbed
