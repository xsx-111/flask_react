How Old Am I? LyricsHow old am I?, I'm old enough to know
The difference between infatuation
And a love that has a chance to grow
How old am I?, I'm not too old to hear
The sweet ring of truth and understanding
When the words "I love you" reach my ear
Don't mind these lines beneath my eyes, they're well-earned souvenirs
Of a thousand nights of laughter and occasional tears
And I hope you won't be jealous of the silver in my hair
It took many lover's quarrels to put it there
How old am I?, you kiss me and I'm young
Love's a road never traveled, life's a song I've never sung
If I make you happy today, I'm the perfect age
As for tomorrow turn the pageEmbed
