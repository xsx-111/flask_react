The Man In The Looking Glass LyricsWriter(s): Howard
I've seen that face before
That face that I see in the mirror
I know that face
I've seen that face before
I knew that dopey guy
When he didn't know how to tie his tie
He stood right there and he had hair galore
The man in the looking glass
Who can he be
The man in the looking glass
Can he possibly be me
Where's our young romeo
The lad who used to sigh
Who's the middle age lothario
With the twinkle in his eye
He seem so much wiser now
Less lonely but then
Could be he's only pretending again
Man in the looking glass smiling away
How's your sacroiliac today
Where's your first love affair
That trajedy d'amour
The true love you thought would be
The end of you for sure
The man in the looking glass
Have no regrets
The man who's wise never forgets
That life is worth living if once in a while
You can look in that looking glass and smileEmbed
