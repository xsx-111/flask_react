Yeah You LyricsCorny niggas, they comin for me
Yelling at me, running at me
Mink coats, pink throats
Weak quotes, low hopes
Anti-dope, filthy? nope
Play a part, never sharp
Fame's their art, game on stop
Euro-centric, zero pimpage
To rags they only is ascendin'
Uninventive, an invention
Forgot they lynched us, never meant it
Rented flower, scented sour
Blemished, gone, finished
Get all up in it didn't
Niggas should've quit it
I can't believe we drove this far
And this is who you really are
It cut, but it won't leave a scar
You're corny, nigga
My hand's so flush you'll have to fold
The played out rhythms that you told
For all the priceless things you sold
You're corny, nigga
Corny niggas, they follow suit
Advance, they will swallow truth
Hollow, shallow ballers queue
Of white shit, they're in hot pursuit
Clones on phones, sniffed out drones
Never made they bones
I know to make they wealth, they'll break they self
All vapor, stand for paper
Music capers, love they haters
Desire the jealous, buy their lovers
Crying fronters, lies and coverups
Self-promoters, slippery-slopers
Speculate, hella-hate
Be full-steady, I'll eat ya plate
Bound by fate to get there late
Conjecture and postulate
Around this ilk, you're never safe
Get slapped up in they fucking face
Look, just because you stole some glow
And each and every thing's a show
Don't mean the trill won't let you know
You're corny, nigga
You're spiritually blasé
Your revolution's so passé
And at the end of every day
You're corny, nigga3Embed
