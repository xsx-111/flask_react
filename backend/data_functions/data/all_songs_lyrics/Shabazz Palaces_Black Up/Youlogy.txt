Youlogy Lyrics

Searching blind, run behind, out of time, into fire
Caked up in fake love to get you high
Searching blind, run behind, out of time, into fire
Caked up in fake love to get you high
Searching blind, run behind, out of time, into fire
Caked up in fake love to get you high
Searching blind, run behind, out of time, into fire
Caked up in fake love to get you high

This shit is gorgeous, it's bitchin' with your fortunes
One hundred medallions in a scout-scrimpin' fortress
Secret potions voted, concealed emotions
Grim-tilted, bounce-killin' shades for his orbit
In a haze, and is hoping that they watchin'
Before artists, he's droppin' to the fifth and bet he boppin'
A little boy coppin', let the top down, aim straight
Climbing in the middle, a-nother statistic for the

Searching blind, run behind, out of time, into fire
Caked up in fake love to get you high
Searching blind, run behind, out of time, into fire
Caked up in fake love to get you high

Say Jack, let me ask you a question:
Do you want it?
Do you want it?
Do you want it?
Fast do you want it? Like
Fast do you want it? Like
How fast do you want it? Like
How fast do you want it? Like
How fast do you want it? Like
How fast do you want it?
Damn nigga, how fast do you want it?
Ice, ice, ice, ice
Ice, ice, ice, ice
Ice, ice, ice, ice
Ice, ice, ice, ice

The nights are getting stronger and the days are getting longer
The buildings getting bigger, outside is getting smaller
The lies are getting truer and the truth is getting brighter
Things are looking blacker, but black is looking whiter
The price is getting higher and the buyers is the flyest
The stars are never brighter, the good are getting tired
Yesterday you threw it 'cause you gots to have the new shit
And money always fools ya, so corny's getting cooler
Nothing's gonna stop it if it's bound to turn a profit
For this amount I'll do it, for this I let you watch it
But right now, let me make a toast with champagne
To commemorate these years that thuggin' went mainstream

Where stars rise and fall and organize regimes
And candidate themselves as some shiny card kings
Convince us that they fake we seen 'em for sneakers and rings
Tell us how they all down to killin' time's is steam
Psht, to live they life off triple beams
And in the end, never really was what they seemed
But take a clip of me in Alexander McQueens
Pose in front the Caddy painted candy money green
Where angels and devils in seven-hundred dollar jeans
And all the eyes will sparkle with "at any cost" gleam

'Cause it's mean, so mean
Ya kna'mean?
It's mean, it's so mean
Yeah, I know you know what I mean
'Said it's mean, so mean
Ya kna'mean?
It's mean, it's so mean
I know you know what I mean1Embed
