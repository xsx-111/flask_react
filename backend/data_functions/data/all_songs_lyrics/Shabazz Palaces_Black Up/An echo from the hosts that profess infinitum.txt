An echo from the hosts that profess infinitum Lyrics
All that diamond dust blowing up your hopes
Flamboyant obstacles, deals made to cope, wow
Embroidered truths, shots at all you soft niggas, huh
Ideas in recline, rise of the lost,

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, no yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Hey, here we stand, slave to networks, master plans
Swag's the brand, open a can, chain's off still, y'all never ran
I brag, I boast, I kill, I coast, I toast to cake and crime
Doing the most, a stronger dose, a king at leisure time
So, so your grace or mine? Don't these legs fantastasize?
Gang signs point to hang them high
Who, Swindle? Oh yeah, that's my guy
The forecast: heat with chance to blast
Hustle though sure don't seem fast
My kiss, my list, my dreams, my stash
See certain things need not be asked

You, you, oh, you
You think I'm selfish, exist only to wish on stars
Lay in wait then cut the bars and then go ice the guards
Touch the hood and go kiss granny, catch a box of food
Play the blade and feel that sunlight 'til you're in the mood
But who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think who you are?
Who do you think who you are?4Embed
