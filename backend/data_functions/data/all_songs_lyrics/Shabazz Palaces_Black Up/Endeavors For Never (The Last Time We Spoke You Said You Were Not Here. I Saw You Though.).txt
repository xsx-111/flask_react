Endeavors For Never (The Last Time We Spoke You Said You Were Not Here. I Saw You Though.) Lyrics
Sneaking in and out of thought
Leaving emotional trip caught up
Love the funk, the flare
I am well aware of the places we've been
And I will offer, in time I will share
The calculations all point to a connection in space
Oooh
Communicate
Hallucinate
Rejuvenate
But still it's lost in the trance
A foreign dance
To sing and chant
To praise and rant
To leap or jump
For will or want
For thrill or don't

Forever and never (X18)

Wow, wow, wow
I watch the dollar slice the air like jet fighters
A black sound set, my heart's re-blighting
Saw the dolphins jumping, no it's not to be invited1Embed
