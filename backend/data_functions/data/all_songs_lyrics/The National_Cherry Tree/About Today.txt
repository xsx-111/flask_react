About Today Lyrics
Today
You were far away
And I
Didn't ask you "Why?"
What could I say?
I was far away
You just walked away
And I just watched you
What could I say?

How close am I
To losing you?

Tonight
You just close your eyes
And I just watch you
Slip away

How close am I
To losing you?

Hey
Are you awake?
Yeah, I'm right here
Well, can I ask you
About today?
How close am I
To losing you?
How close am I
To losing?15Embed
