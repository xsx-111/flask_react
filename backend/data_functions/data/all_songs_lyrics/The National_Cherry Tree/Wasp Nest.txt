Wasp Nest LyricsYou're cussing a storm in a cocktail dress
Your mother wore when she was young
Red sun saint around your neck
A wet martini in a paper cup
You're a wasp nest
You're a wasp nest
Your eyes are broken bottles
And I'm afraid to ask
And all your wrath and cutting beauty
You're poison in the pretty glass
You're a wasp nest
You're a wasp nest
You're all humming live wires
Under your killing clothes
Get over here I wanna
Kiss your skinny throat
You're a wasp nest
You're a wasp nest3Embed
