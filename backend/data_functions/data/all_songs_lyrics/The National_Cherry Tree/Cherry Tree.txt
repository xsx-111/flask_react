Cherry Tree Lyrics
Take us down and all apart
Cherry tree
Lay us out on the table
You're sharp alright

But no one is asking to leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we?
No one is asking to leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we?
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships

Don't look at me
I'm only breathing
Don't look at me; I'm indiscreet
Don't look at me
I'm only breathing
Don't look at me; I'm indiscreet
You're sharp alright
But no one is asking to leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we?
No one is asking to leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we?
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Can we show
A little discipline?
Can we show
A little discipline?
Can we?
Can we?
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips
Can we show
A little discipline?
Can we show
A little discipline?
Can we?
Can we?
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships
Loose lips sink ships4Embed
