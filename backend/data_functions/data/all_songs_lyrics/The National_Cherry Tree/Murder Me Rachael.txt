Murder Me Rachael Lyrics
I saw my love with pretty boy
I saw my love with pretty boy

Murder me Rachael; I made a mistake
I loved her to ribbons
Loved her to ribbons
Murder me Rachael; I made a mistake
Murder me Rachael
Murder me Rachael

I saw my love with pretty boy
I saw my love with pretty boy
So say goodbye to pretty boy
Just say goodbye to pretty boy

Her pretty little ribbons
Her pretty little name
Sew it in my skin
Never go away
Her pretty little ribbons
Her pretty little name
I sew it in my skin
She'll never go away
I saw my love with pretty boy
I saw my love with pretty boy
So say goodbye to pretty boy
Just say goodbye to pretty boy
Tomorrow won't be pretty
Tomorrow won't be pretty

Love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons
Love her, love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbons
Love her to ribbonsEmbed
