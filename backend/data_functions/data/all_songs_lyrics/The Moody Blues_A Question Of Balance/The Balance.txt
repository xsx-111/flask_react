The Balance LyricsAfter he had journeyed
And his feet were sore
And he was tired
He came upon an orange grove
And he rested
And he lay in the cool
And while he rested, he took to himself an orange and tasted it
And it was good
And he felt the earth to his spine
And he asked, and he saw the tree above him, and the stars
And the veins in the leaf
And the light, and the balance
And he saw magnificent perfection
Whereon he thought of himself in balance
And he knew he was
Just open your eyes
And realize, the way it's always been
Just open your mind
And you will find
The way it's always been
Just open your heart
And that's a start
And he thought of those he angered
For he was not a violent man
And he thought of those he hurt
For he was not a cruel man
And he thought of those he frightened
For he was not an evil man
And he understood
He understood himself
Upon this he saw that when he was of anger or knew hurt or felt fear
It was because he was not understanding
And he learned, compassion
And with his eye of compassion
He saw his enemies like unto himself
And he learned love
Then, he was answered
Just open your eyes
And realize, the way it's always been
Just open your mind
And you will find
The way it's always been
Just open your heart
And that's a start2Embed
