Melancholy Man Lyrics

I'm a melancholy man, that's what I am
All the world surrounds me and my feet are on the ground
I'm a very lonely man, doing what I can
All the world astounds me and I think I understand
That we're going to keep growing, wait and see

When all the stars are falling down
Into the sea and on the ground
And angry voices carry on the wind
A beam of light will fill your head
And you'll remember what's been said
By all the good men this world's ever known
Another man is what you'll see
Who looks like you and looks like me
And yet somehow he will not feel the same
His life caught up in misery
He doesn't think like you and me
'Cause he can't see what you and I can see


When all the stars are falling down
Into the sea and on the ground
And angry voices carry on the wind
A beam of light will fill your head
And you'll remember what's been said
By all the good men this world's ever known
Another man is what you'll see
Who looks like you and looks like me
And yet somehow he will not feel the same
His life caught up in misery (Melancholy man)
He doesn't think like you and me (A very lonely man)
'Cause he can't see what you and I can see
I'm a melancholy man (When all the stars are falling down)
That's what I am (Into the sea and on the ground and angry voices carry on the wind)
All the world surrounds me and my feet are on the ground
I'm a very lonely man (A beam of light will fill your head)
Doing what I can (And you'll remember what's been said by all the good men this world's ever known)
All the world astounds me and I think I understand
That we're going to keep growing, wait and see

(When all the stars are falling down)
I'm a melancholy man
(Into the sea and on the ground...)
That's what I am
(And angry voices carry on the wind)
All the world surrounds me
(A beam of light will fill your head)
I'm a very lonely man
(And you'll remember what's been said)
Doing what I can
(By all the good men this world's ever known)
All the world astounds me and I think I understand
(Another man is what you'll see)
That we're going to keep growing
(Who looks like you and looks like me)
Just you wait and see
(And yet somehow he will not feel the same)
Oh, believe me, believe me, believe me
(His life caught up in misery, he doesn't think like you and me)
I'm a melancholy man8Embed
