HARD Lyrics
Hard

Latex gloves, smack so hard
PVC, I get so hard
Platform shoes, kick so hard
Ponytail, yank so hard
Leatherette, party so hard
PVC, I get so hard
Platform shoes, kick so hard
But it's just so hard, so hard
Hard
Hard

Hard hard, I get so hard
Hard hard, I get so hard
Hard hard, I get so hard
I just get so hard

Patent boot, yank so hard
Silicon, squeeze so hard
Ponytail, yank so hard
Do I make you proud? I try so hard
Rubber doll, bang so hard
PVC, I get so hard
Latex gloves, smack so hard
Platform shoes
In the club, party so hard
I'm so hard
Rubber doll
Latex gloves, smack so hard
PVC, I get so hard
Platform shoes, kick so hard
But it's just so hard, so hard
So hard
Hard, hard, I get so hard
Hard, hard, I get so hard
Hard, hard, I get so hard
Hard, hard, I get so hard
Hard, hard, I get so hard
Hard, hard, I get so hard
Hard, hard, I get so hard
I just get so hard11Embed
