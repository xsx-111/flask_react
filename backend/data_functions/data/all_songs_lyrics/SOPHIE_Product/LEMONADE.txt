I've got something to tell you
I hope you'll understand
I never meant to hurt you
It wasn't in my plans
It's just that when I'm with you
And everything's okay
I get that fizzy feeling
And I want lemonade

It wasn't in my plans
It's just that when I'm with you
And everything's okay
I get that fizzy feeling
And I want lemonade4Embed
