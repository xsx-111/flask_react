El Naco Lyrics
Ants in the rice
Ants in the seaweed
Ants in the kimchi

A worm in my stool
We lived together for months
We both burst with shaking rage

Drunk and nude on the steps,
A cross drawn on her chin
We both look away
Cupcake on a piece of cake
Goodbye, haunted house
Chuck-bo-buck, banana-nana-fo-fuck!

I see it and I have no right to see it
I don't even know what it is
Blood paid with blood
Sit on my lap
It might be the last time we ever feel loveEmbed
