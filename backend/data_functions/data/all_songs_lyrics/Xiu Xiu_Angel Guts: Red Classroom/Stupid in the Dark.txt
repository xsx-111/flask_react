Stupid in the Dark Lyrics
The police showed me a photo
You look so unlikable
I said I'm not sure it is you
But I wish I said it was you

You taught me a lesson
People are stupid in the dark
People are useless in the moonlight
People are meant to be loved
Loved without thought
Loved without thought, oh
In the moonlight

Pull out the gun
Give me your money
Give me your phone
You can keep your ID
The detectives encourage
As I punch you in the tummy
Once we felt sorry for you people
But not that sorry

You taught me a lesson
People are stupid in the dark
People are useless in the moonlight
People are meant to be loved
Loved without thought
Loved without thought, oh
In the moonlightEmbed
