A Knife in the Sun Lyrics
A knife in the sun
I don't know how it happened
The white lady
Cops, transexuals
Taxi drivers, homosexuals
Drug dealers, mariachis, pick pockets

Knife, knife, knife, knife
Knife, knife, knife, knife

Prince of peace
At least indulge us
Flesh was once food
Now food is flesh
Your lover will hate you
Despair and shut up

Knife, knife, knife, knife
Knife, knife, knife, knife

Gold, silver, copper
Blue, violet, red
GreenEmbed
