Two tears in a bucket
Adult friends, adult friends
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
The world is what it is

Oh, I kiss you
Nobody sees it
Oh, we hold hands
Nobody knows about it
Oh, you kiss me
We just sit there
Overly experienced
Adult friends, adult friends

You've reduced your breasts
To a more tasteful size D
When I touch them
It is like a lobster crawling under my arm

Oh, I kiss you
Nobody can see it
Oh, I pinch your
Nobody knows about it
Oh, you fondle
But we just sit there
With no tomorrows
Adult friends, adult friendsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
