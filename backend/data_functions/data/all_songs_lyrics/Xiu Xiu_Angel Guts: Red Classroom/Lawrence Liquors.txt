Lawrence Liquors Lyrics
Don't tell me someone is waiting
No one is waiting
Don't tell me someone is whispering, too
Would you, sonny?
Could you, bunny?
But no one is there

Right, a mockery!
Right?!

Sha, sha, sha!
(Awoo, awoo, awoo)
Sha, sha, sha!
(Awoo, awoo, awoo)
Sha, sha, sha!
(Awoo, awoo)
Sha, sha, sha!
(Awoo, awoo, awoo!)

Don't tell me you are not wrinkled
Everything is wrinkled
Don't tell me you are not whispering, too
Don't tell me that I am wrong, wrong, wrong
But no one is there
Right, a mockery!
Right?!

Sha, sha, sha!
(Awoo, awoo, awoo)
Sha, sha, sha!
(Awoo, awoo, awoo)
Sha, sha, sha!
(Awoo, awoo)
Sha, sha, sha!
(Awoo, awoo, awoo!)Embed
