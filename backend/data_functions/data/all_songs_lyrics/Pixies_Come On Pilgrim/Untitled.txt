Untitled Lyrics
'You fuckin' die!'
I said
To her
I said, 'You fuckin' die!'
To her
Huh? What?
No, no...
I was talking to Kim
I said, 'You fuckin' die.'
No, I was... we were just goofing around
No, no -- it didn't have anything to do with anything
She said, "Don't... anybody touches my stuff..."
And I said 'You fuckin' die', like that
I was finishing her part for her
You know what I mean?Embed
