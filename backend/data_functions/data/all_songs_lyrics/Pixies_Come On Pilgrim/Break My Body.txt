Break My Body Lyrics
I'm the horny loser
You'll find me crashing through my mother's door
I am the ugly lover
You'll find us rolling on the dirty floor

Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones

I'm a belly dancer
I'll shake forever and I'll never care
I'm a building jumper
Roof to roof, you see me flying in the air

Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Bones
Somebody got hurt
Somebody get hurt
Somebody got hurt4Embed
