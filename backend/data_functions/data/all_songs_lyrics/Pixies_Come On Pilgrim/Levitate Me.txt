Levitate Me Lyrics
Gimme help, give it hell
You can levitate me
Then take off them rings, off them holes
Levitate me
Higher place, levitate me

Elevator lady, elevator lady
Elevator lady, elevator lady
Lady, levitate me
If all in all is true
If all in all is true
If all in all is true
If all is true
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?

Shakey shake, hey, Shakey!
Levitate me
Come on Pilgrim, you know he loves you
Levitate me
Higher place, he kicked a baby
Elevator lady, elevator lady
Elevator lady, lady
Elevator lady, lady
Lady, levitate me
If all in all is true
If all in all is true
If all in all is true
If all is true
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?

Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me...2Embed
