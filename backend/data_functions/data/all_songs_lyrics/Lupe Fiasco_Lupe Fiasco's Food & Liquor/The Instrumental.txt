The Instrumental Lyrics
Uh!
And he never lies
And he never lies
Uh, yeah!

He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes
Everything he sees, he absorbs and adopts it
Mmm, he mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box, but he can't remember how to stop it
Uh, so he continues to watch it
Hoping that it'll give him something that he can box with
Or how to locksmith, see, the box is locked in a box
Ain't got the combination to unlock it
That's why he watches, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might show him
What to take off the locks with
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental like that
And he never lies (He never lies, he never lies, uh)
And he never lies (Uh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (He never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all
He just sits, and listens to the people in the boxes
Everything he hears, he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not coming out the box, he blocks it
See, he loves the box and hope they never stop it
Anything the box tell him to do, he does it
Anything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it in a box
When he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps
Cause he stays up to watch it, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might get stolen
And that's the last of the boxes
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental, like that
And he never lies (He never lies, he never lies, uh)
And he never lies (Uh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (He never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all

(Anything at all) He never lies
Uh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And he never lies (He never lies, he never lies, uh)
And he never lies (Uh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (He never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all

(Anything at all, anything at all)
Uhh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
(Anything at all, anything at all)
Uh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start17Embed
