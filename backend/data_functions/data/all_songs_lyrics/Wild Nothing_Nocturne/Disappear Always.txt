Disappear Always LyricsPull the blinds
All the black dreams I've had
Well they don't mean much now
When I rise at noon
I'm missing someone I don't know
And I don't want to be alone
And this house is now a grave
I've been sleeping here for days
I'm too hidden to awake
So i disappear always
Call someone up
Just to have a drink
We can talk about anything, I don't care
Getting out of the house
For an hour or two
But it's missing something I can't explain
And this house is now a grave
I've been sleeping here for days
I'm too hidden to awake
So i disappear alwaysEmbed
