Nocturne LyricsYou wanna know me, well, what’s to know?
Do I amuse you, when the night is slow?
Do your eyelids ever close
Caught spirits in your waking woes?
I know where to find you, I know where you go
And I just want to let you know
You can have me, you can have me all
You can have me, you can have me all
And you’re twisted, what can I say?
Your days are empty and my tongue is decayed
And we stay up just to tempt me
One more night of your company
I know where to find you, I know where you go
And I just want to let you know
You can have me, you can have me allEmbed
