Through the Grass LyricsYou see (Do you see)
The melting of our days (Of our days)
In time (Is there time)
Nothing ever stays (Ever stays)
I let you go
You let me in
I want you
I let you go
You let me in
I want you
Around (All around)
Just long enough to touch (Enough to touch)
This skin (Touch your skin)
Turning into dust (Into dust)
A song (It's our song)
Calling through the grass (Through the grass)
I let you go
You let me in
I want you
I let you go
You let me in
I want you
I let you go
You let me in
I want you
I let you go
You let me in
I want youEmbed
