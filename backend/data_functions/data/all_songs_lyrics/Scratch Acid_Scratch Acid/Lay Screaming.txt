Lay Screaming LyricsHer! Burn her!
Let's make her into a martyr
Because we split her breast
And she's disheartened, dismayed, disemboweled
The dead princess lay screaming and her cunt's ripped
The dead princess lay silent and her cunt's ripped
The dead princess lay screaming and her cunt's ripped
Ripped! Ripped!
The blood through the cloth, wet with agony
Brain bedlam beget and lo
She gives up the ghost, almost
The dead princess lay screaming and her cunt's ripped
The dead princess lay screaming and her cunt's ripped
The dead princess lay screaming and her cunt's ripped
Ripped! Ripped! Ripped!
The blood through the cloth, wet with agony
Brain bedlam beget and lo
She gives up the ghost, almost
The dead princess lay screaming and her cunt's ripped
The dead princess lay screaming and her cunt's ripped
The dead princess lay screaming and her cunt's ripped
Ripped! Ripped! Ripped! Ripped!Embed
