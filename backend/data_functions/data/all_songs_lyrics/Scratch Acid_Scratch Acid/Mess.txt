Mess LyricsI have a mess in my house, I confess in my house
And it's getting worse and I'm getting scared of my house
I'm having a lot of trouble with this whole thing
A lot of trouble
With cat shit, yellow food, and bread mold
Bread mold
I have a mess in my house, ungodly mess in my house
I couldn't be bothered - everywhere I look a fuckin' mess
Bugs on the blue fish, piss on the speaker
I feel blue
And things is lookin' bleaker
Bleaker
It stinks in my house - it stinks
It stinks in my house - it stinks
The air is stale and foul in there
Blood and juice and pubic hairEmbed
