Greatest Gift Lyrics
Garden of buried pleasures
Neatly in a row
Are planted life's true secrets
In a world yet still unknown

Six feet deep down dark
Free from concern
The greatest gift from life itself
Lies the food for the worms

Garden of buried pleasures
Neatly in a row
Are planted life's true secrets
In a world yet still unknown

Six feet deep down dark
Free from concern
The greatest gift from life itself
Lies the food for the worms

Worm, worm, worm, worm
Garden of buried pleasures
Neatly in a row
Are planted life's true secrets
In a world yet still unknown

Six feet deep down dark
Free from concern
The greatest gift from life itself
Lies the food for the worms1Embed
