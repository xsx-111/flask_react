Monsters Lyrics
I can see myself helpless
And nailed spread-eagle to the bed
And night creature claws gash at my back
Blood comes steaming, pulsing and repulsing!
And I can feel its hungry tongue
And its hot moist red razor lips!

Silk cloth deep in my mouth
My screams come out as moans
Come out as moans, come out as moans!
Silk cloth deep in my mouth
My screams come out as moans
Come out as moans, come out as moans!

I can see gauzy phantoms
And they're whispering horrible things
Things left better unsaid
Apparitions the dark night brings
Hold me in their sheer arms
And sweat gleams on my trembling back

Silk cloth deep in my mouth
My screams come out as moans
Come out as moans, come out as moans!Embed
