Spoon Lyrics
Spoon in spoon
Stirring my coffee
I thought of you
And turned to the gate

And on my way
Came up with the answers
I scratched my head
And the answers were gone
From hand to hand
Wrist to the elbow
Red blood sand
Could dad be God?
Crosses cross
Hung out like a wet rag
Forgive you, why?
You hung me out to dry

And, well maybe I'm crazy
But laughing out loud makes the pain pass by
And maybe you're a little crazy
But laughing out loud makes it all subside
Holding, I'm holding
I'm still falling


But on my way
Crack lightning then thunder
I hid my head
And the storm slipped away

Well maybe I'm crazy
But laughing out loud
Makes it all pass by

And maybe you're a little crazy
Til laughing out loud
Makes it all alright
Laughing out loud

From time to time
Minutes and hours
Some move ahead
While some lag behind
It's like the balloon
That rise and then vanish
This drop of hope
That falls from his eyes
Spoon in spoon
Stirring my coffee
I think of this
And turn to go away

But as I walk
There are voices behind me
Saying sinners sin
Come now and play

Until you're laughing out loud
Come now and playEmbed
