The Dreaming Tree Lyrics
Standing here the old man said to me
"Long before these crowded streets
Here stood my dreaming tree"
Below it he would sit for hours at a time
Now progress takes away what forever took to find
And now he's falling hard, he feels the falling dark--
How he longs to be beneath his dreaming tree
Conquered fear to climb, a moment froze in time
When the girl who first he kissed promised him she'd be his
Remembered mother's words there beneath the tree
"No matter what the world, you'll always be my baby"
Mommy come quick! The dreaming tree has died
The air is growing thick; a fear, he cannot hide;
The dreaming tree has died...
Oh have you no pity?
This thing I do, I do not deny it
All through this smile, as crooked as danger
I do not deny I know in my mind
I would leave you now if I had the strength to
I would leave you up to your own devices
Will you not talk? Can you take pity?
I don't ask much, but won't you speak
Please?
From the start she knew she had it made
Easy up until then--for sure she'd make the grade
Adorers came in hordes to lay down in her wake
Gave it all she had but treasures slowly fade
Now she's falling hard, she feels the fall of dark
How did this fall apart? She drinks to fill it up
A smile of sweetest flowers, wilted so and soured
Black tears stain the cheeks that once were so admired
She thinks when she was small, there on her father's knees
How he had promised her "You'll always be my baby"
"Daddy come quick! The dreaming tree has died...
I can't find my way home, there is no place to hide
The dreaming tree has died!"
Shake
If I had the strength to
I would leave you up to your own devices
Will you not talk? Can you take pity?
I don't ask much, but won't you speak
Please?
Take me back
Save me pleaseEmbed
