The Stone Lyrics
I've this creeping
Suspicion that things here are not as they seem
Oh, reassure me
Why do I feel as if I'm in too deep?
Oh, I've been praying
For some way to show them
I'm not what they see
Oh, I have done wrong
But what I did I thought needed be done
I swear
Oh, Unholy day
If I leave now I might get away
Thisweighs on me
As heavy as stone and as blue as I go

I was just wondering if you'd come along
To hold up my head when my head won't hold on
I'll do the same if the same's what you want
But if not I'll go, I will go alone

I'm a long way from that fool's mistake
And now forever pay
No, run
I will run and I'll be ok

Oh, I need so
To stay in your arms, see you smile, hold you close
Oh, And it weighs on me
As heavy as stone and a bone chilling cold
I was just wondering if you'd come along
Just tell me you will

Let it all fall outEmbed
