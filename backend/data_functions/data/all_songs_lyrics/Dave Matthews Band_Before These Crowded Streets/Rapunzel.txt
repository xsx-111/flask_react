Rapunzel Lyrics
Ha, open wide
Oh so good I'll eat you
Take me for a ride
In your sweet delicious
Perfect, little mouth
There upon I linger
You will have no doubt
That I do my best for you
I do, ooh..
Let's start to get it going
Lost myself just thinking
About the two of us
From each other drinking
Begin with the lips
Fingertip and kissing
Turn me inside out
That I do my best for you
Up and down we go
From the top you push me
This is such a thrill
Lost in love and dancing
Shake your tambourine
You blow my head open
Of one thing I'm sure
That I do my best for you
I do...
For you I would crawl
Through the darkest dungeon
Climb a castle wall
If you're my Rapunzel
You let your hair down
Right in through the window
Good they locked the door
Because I do my best for you
I think the world of you
All of my heart I do
Blood through my veins for you
You alone have all of me
I give my world to you
And to you I will be true
Too good to be real
The smell of something cooking
My soul up to steal
Of my food we're filling
What you've been given me
For it there's no measure
Of one thing I know
Is I give my best for you
I think the world of you
With all of my heart I do
This blood through my veins for you
You alone have all of me
From you my strength is so full
To carry your burdens, too
I give my word to you
Hips locked up so tight
You drive me crazy
Crazy is alright
With you looking at me
You make me feel high
Every single thing you do to me
Is like I'm drunk
I do my best for you I do
Given me, given me the shivers1Embed
