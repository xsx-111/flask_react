Save Me LyricsUnholy
I feel sick and unholy
My soul don't wanna know me
I've been living like dirt
Hey lover
I've been touched by another
I guess I'm blowing my cover
I guess I'm blowing my life
Oh save me
Nothing's right for me lately
I was wrong but don't hate me
I've been doing it for myselfEmbed
