She LyricsShe comes undone
Got no fix she had no fun
Tries to shoot holes in the sun
It's got her running
She comes complete
With a switchblade and her speed
But she can't take all this heat
It's got her hiding
But I just don't get her
No I just don't get her at all
She wants to break my fall
She doesn't speak at all
She spends her day
On her knees she likes to pray
You can always hear her say
That life means something
She spends her time
Out of space and out of line
Planning some unholy crime
That comes to nothing
She said
How do you think it feels1Embed
