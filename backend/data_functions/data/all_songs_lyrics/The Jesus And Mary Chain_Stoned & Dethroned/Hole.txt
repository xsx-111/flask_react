Hole LyricsThis has been my prison
Got no high got no low
This has been religion
Took my heart killed my soul
All I want is a dream
Give me something to dream
Got myself in a scene
Don't know where I've been
All I want is a dream
Something naked and clean
Somebody give me a call
I'm climbing up on the wall
And I want it all
And I need it all
I can't get it
Took my heart and soul
Give them back to meEmbed
