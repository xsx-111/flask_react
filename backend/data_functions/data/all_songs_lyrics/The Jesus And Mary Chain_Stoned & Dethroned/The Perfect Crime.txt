The Perfect Crime LyricsWe fell in love you liked the look in my eye
Hand in hand we reach for the sky
But I was easy baby
Yeah I was easy baby
And you told me so long
You never ever wanna see me baby
I lost control I got a hold of a knife
I took a hold then I ended your life
But it was easy baby
Yeah it was easy baby
I told you so long
I'm never ever gonna see you baby1Embed
