God Help Me LyricsGod help me through this day
God please help me through this day
I'm blind can't see the way
God please help me through this day
I can't take it
I just can't take it anymore
God help me through this day
God please help me through this day
I'm blind can't see the way
God illuminate this day
I can't take it
I just can't take it anymore
I've been waiting longtime
I've been waiting longtime
I've been waiting too long
To see the light1Embed
