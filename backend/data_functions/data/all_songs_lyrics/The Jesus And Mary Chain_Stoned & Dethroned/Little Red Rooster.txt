Little Red Rooster LyricsI am the little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
I am the little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Keep everything in the farmyard upset in every way
Dogs begin to bark now, hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark now, hounds begin to howl
Watch out strange cat people
Little red rooster's on the prowl
If you see my little red rooster, please drive him home
If you see my little red rooster, please drive him home
Ain't had no peace in the farmyard
Since my little red rooster's been goneEmbed
