Wish I Could LyricsWe were searching for a fire
And we settled for a spark
Sparks glow like stars in the dark
Of course they do just like you
And I wish that I could fall for you
Yeah I wish that I could fall for you
Yeah I wish that I could fall
Well jesus walked
On the water on the water
We walk on dampness too
Yes we do through and through
If we had the time we'd take it
If we had the mind we'd make it
If we had the love
We could leave this world behind
Oh I wish that I could fall
Yeah I wish that I could fall
Yeah I wish that I could fallEmbed
