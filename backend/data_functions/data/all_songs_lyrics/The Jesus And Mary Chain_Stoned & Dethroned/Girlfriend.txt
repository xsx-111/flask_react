Girlfriend LyricsDon't wanna hear about your sins
Dirty little stories about needles and skin
Don't wanna hear about how you scored
The guys who tripped, how your dress got torn
Don't wanna speak in the same old tongue
Don't wanna bite and I don't want burned
Don't wanna live in the same old place
Got new ideas and I got new taste
Come on you are my friend
Some things will never end
We done our time and we had some fun
I want to get things done
Don't wanna hear about your sins
Dirty little stories about needles and skin
Don't wanna hear about that stuff
You've done too much but it's not enough
One more kiss turns to one more hit
Well I don't feel like kissing on it
One more hit turns to one more crash
You move too slow but it's much too fast
Come on you are my friend
Some things will never end
We done our time and we had some fun
My life has just begun1Embed
