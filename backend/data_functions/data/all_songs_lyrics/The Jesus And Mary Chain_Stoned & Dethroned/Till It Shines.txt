Till It Shines LyricsCome, come and dry your eyes
Before the morning sun arrives
Kiss, everybody is a star
No matter who or what they are
I could tell the truth but what's the use
It's been abused by us
Junk the junk love the love
It's a secret from above
Ain't it good it's the drug that keeps us true
I got to get some through to you
I got mine and I got you
Just for the two of us
Come, come and dry your eyes
And watch the morning sun arrive
Kiss, everybody is a star
No matter who or what they are
I could tell the truth but what's the use
It's been abused by us
Until it shines
Till it shines
I won't dieEmbed
