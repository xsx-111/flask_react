Write Record Release Blues LyricsIf that phone keeps ringing
I'm gonna lose some cool
I'm in my closet and I'm okay
Leave me in peaceful abject misery
I'm a young man now but
There's an old man on my back
As he gets stronger I get weak
Someday soon he'll take the place of me
If that scum keeps rising
I'm gonna jump this ship
Tell me where did it go wrong
I can't fix it I'll just sing my song
You can deride and mock me
That's been done before
I won't get on my knees for you
I won't be a record business whore1Embed
