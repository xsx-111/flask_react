Dirty Water LyricsIt's off then it's on
It's on then it's gone
It's high and it's steep
It's wide and it's deep
Fuck with me, and I'll fuck with you
Isn't that what we're supposed to do
Kick me down and I will kick you too
Isn't that what we're supposed to do
I've been swimming in the dirty water
I've been swimming where the fish won't go
I've been swimming in the dirty water
I've been swimming where the fish won't go
It's off then it's on
It's on then it's goneEmbed
