Everybody I Know LyricsToo long I have been a slave
Kissing dirt for what I crave
Too long I have been a liar
Too long I had fun with fire
Ghosts of people I have been
Come around and shout "obscene"
Ghosts of things I've said and done
Come to haunt me watch me run
Everybody I know is falling apart
Everybody I know wants to die
Wants to find1Embed
