Rubidoux Lyrics
So, let's go deadbolt your shed door
Cram your paper money snug closer than before
Chandeliers are falling in graveyard rows
And your eyes are shifting dials like AM radios

Snowed over, river melted more last night
Still the same to shovel windshields of spidered ice
Yes, yes, mother I mean to be baptized
Seeds that make the higher ground grow and multiply

Drive to Rubidoux in the middle of the night
Bourbon and a pistol in the dash out of sight
What did you expect? Romantic Isle of Wight?
Just empty desert light

Few feet float above these Persian throw rugs
And tuck themselves in percussion as succession was
Tonight as single simple folk played themselves low
Just like talking city blues down in the hallway low

Drive to Rubidoux in the middle of the night
Bourbon and a pistol in the dash out of sight
What did you expect? Romantic Isle of Wight?
Just empty desert light
I suggest that you respect the deal
And keep your nose out of business of
Priests and holy men, the life you have chosen
Is filled with dirty fingernails and
Lost and founds and cancelled appointments

10 more avenues, time to choose
And there's rain that'll fall down on five
There's 50 doors to choose from and there's many more
Many more inside, inside, inside
Well, the nighttime's going to come
The nighttime's going to come

Drive to Rubidoux in the middle of the night
Bourbon and a pistol in the dash out of sight
What did you expect? Romantic Isle of Wight?
Just empty desert light

Drive to Rubidoux in the middle of the night
Drive to Rubidoux in the middle of the night
Drive to Rubidoux in the middle of the night
Just empty desert light
It's just empty desert light
It's just empty desert light

Getting closer everyday
Getting closer everyday

Lord, have mercy on me
We're talking about two different things
Television and Life Magazine
Lord, have mercy on me
Oh, Lord, have mercy on me

Got this idea in my head and I can't get it out
'Cause all your money and all your culture I could truly live without
I'm piling treasures up on Earth
What you keep and what you take
Property, vanity, even knowledge for knowledge sake
And I said

Lord, have mercy on me
We're talking about two different things
Television and Life Magazine
Lord, have mercy on me
Oh, Lord, have mercy on me
Don't want to see no psychoanalyst
Experienced in assisting to adjust
European travel, the H-bomb, presidential elections
The front page of the New York Times
The front page of the New York Times

Lord, have mercy on me
We're talking about two different things
Television and Life Magazine
Lord, have mercy on me
Lord, Lord, have mercy on me

Quit your griping, shine your shoes
I'll tell you a little secret for your blues
Don't make no difference who's watching from the stands
The fat lady always claps her hands

Lord, have mercy on me
Say it even if you're robbing from the poor
Lord, have mercy on me
I believe the words can change the heart
The words can change the heart
The words can change the heart

Lord, have mercy on me
Lord, Lord, Lord, have mercy on me
Talking about two different things
Television and Life Magazine
Yeah, yeah, Lord, have mercy on me
Oh, God, Lord, have mercy on me

Getting closer every day
Getting closer every day
Getting closer every day1Embed
