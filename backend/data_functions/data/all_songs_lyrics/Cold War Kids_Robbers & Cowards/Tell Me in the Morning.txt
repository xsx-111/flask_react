Tell Me in the Morning Lyrics
Stick around greenleaf, now that she's gone
Take my time when I got to bed, and I sleep long
I'm getting over, mulling over
I said, "Could you just wait to tell me in the morning?"

Slow it down, slow it down
And lay it low, save it for the morning

I know that you would like, like to change me
Make me softer to your voice like a baby
I'm using caution, but you're warning
I wish that you could wait to tell me in the morning

Slow it down, slow it down
And lay it low, save it for the morning

I'm shouting questions, like a fist fight
You try to take me by the arms lead me to the light
I'm almost over, warring over
I wish that you could wait to tell me in the morning
Slow it down, slow it down
And lay it low, save it for the morning
And I'll tell you one more thing

I confess to self-deception
And I broke the lock and I pried it open
Then pretended to be stolen
I am my own thief in the night

Struggled for many years just to get here
To learn humility and be my own teacher
I guess it backfired cause my motive
Was just to take another care 'bout what I give

Slow it down, slow it down
And lay it low, save it for the morning

I'm shouting questions, like a fist fight
You try to take me by the arms lead me to the light
I'm almost over, warring over
I wish that you could wait to tell me in the morning
Slow it down, slow it down
And lay it low, save it for the morning
But I'll tell you one more thing

I confess to self-deception
And I broke the lock and I pried it open
Then pretended to be stolen
I am my own thief in the nightEmbed
