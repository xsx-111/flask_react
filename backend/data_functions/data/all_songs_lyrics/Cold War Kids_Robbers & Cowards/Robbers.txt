Robbers Lyrics
Sulking
Walking 'round the city after dark
Need protection
From street toughs
Who clip the locks and rip the doors off rough
Like cowards

And oh, this life of glorified
Robbing from the blind is not easy, you see
Don't think I don't know sympathy
My victims in my shadow staring back at me

Not me, I'm knockin'
Tiptoe outside a stranger's door
Casually let myself in
Fill pockets
With trinkets, purses, china, antique armoire

And oh, this life of glorified
Robbing from the blind is not easy, you see
Don't think I don't know sympathy
My victims in my shadow staring back at me
There's robbers in my thoughts
They tell me what to think
They're hiding in my clothes
Crawling in the kitchen sink
Ba da da da da da da...3Embed
