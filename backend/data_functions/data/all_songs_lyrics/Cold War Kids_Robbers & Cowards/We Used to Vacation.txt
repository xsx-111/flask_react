We Used to Vacation Lyrics
I kissed the kids at noon
Then stumbled out the room
I caught a cab, ran up a tab on Seventh and Flowers
Beth's recital, I had to run
Missed my son's graduation
Punched the Nichols boy for taking his seat
He gets all that anger from me

Still things could be much worse
Natural disasters
On the evening news
Still things could be much worse
We've still got our health
My paycheck in the mail

I promised to my wife and children
I'd never touch another drink as long as I live
But even then, it sounds so soothing
This will blow over in time
This will all blow over in time

I'm just an honest man
Provide for me and mine
I give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations
Two weeks paid vacation
Won't heal the damage done
I need another one
Still things could be much worse
Natural disasters
On the evening news
Still things could be much worse
We've still got our health
My paycheck in the mail

I promised to my wife and children
I'd never touch another drink as long as I live
But even then, it sounds so soothing
To mix a gin and sink into oblivion

I promised to my wife and children
That accident left everyone a little shook up
But at the meetings I felt so empty
This will blow over in time
This will all blow over in time

Mmm, a da da da da da
A da da da da da
A da da da da whoa
A da da da da da
A da da da da da
A da da da da whoa9Embed
