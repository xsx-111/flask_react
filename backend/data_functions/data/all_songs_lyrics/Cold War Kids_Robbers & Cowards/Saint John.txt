Saint John Lyrics
Supper time in the hole
Supper time in the hole
I shamed my family, shamed my home
Supper time

Old Saint John on death row, he's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row, he's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row, he's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row (oh, he's just waiting)

Now all the white boys in their Sta-Prest slacks
At home for the Summer from college
Staying out late getting rowdy at the bar
And looking for trouble uptown
They come up my block, 'bout five or six of them
Smashing their bottles in the gutter
Yelling all kinds of obscenities
About women and God and law

Another supper time in the hole
Supper time
I shamed my family, shamed my home
Supper time
Young girl turned the corner with the curved dress on
That girl was my sister
Just got off the night shift at Pettington's Place
Just want to go home, get some sleep
Boys grab her by the waist with the caffeine eyes
Their hands all fidget electric
I picked up a brick from my Papa's front yard
And threw it at the tallest boy's face
Well, blood was streaming like a well that sprung
I couldn't believe what I had just done
Well, the other boy ran and this one stayed
On the ground and he would never move again

Old Saint John on death row, he's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row, he's just waiting for a pardon
All us boys on death row, we're just waiting for a pardon
All us boys on death row

Yours truly on trial, I testify
I gotta keep on running till the well runs dry
Yours truly on trial, I testify
I gotta keep on running till the well runs
Yours truly on trial, I testify
I gotta keep on running till the well runs dry
Yours truly on trial, I testify
I gotta keep on running till the well runs dry7Embed
