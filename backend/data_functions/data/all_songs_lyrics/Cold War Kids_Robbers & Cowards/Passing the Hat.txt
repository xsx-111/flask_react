Passing the Hat Lyrics
Look up from the hymnal
Look 'round at the faces
Of families closing their eyes
We're taking Communion
And passing the offering hat
Around at the same time

I reached for the hat
And take all the cash
And slide it into my ragged coat sleeve
And leave in its place
A note to explain
All of the reasons that stealing has
Led me to leave

If there was a worthy cause for to give to
May I be so bold as to say
The givers not knowing where their money's going
Is as sinful as throwing away

Stained glasses shine on my red wine
And the sweat of my brow drips to my shaking knees
A small sacrifice to benefit one man's journey away from America's seas
Sweet sweet sigh of relief
Sweet sweet O Baltic Sea
Sweet sweet sigh of relief
Sweet sweet O Baltic Sea
Sweet sweet sigh of relief
Sweet sweet O Baltic Sea
Ooohhhh
Ooohhhh
Nobody here knows my name
Call it right or wrong
I bought my ticket just the sameEmbed
