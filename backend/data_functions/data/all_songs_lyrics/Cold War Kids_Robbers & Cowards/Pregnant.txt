Pregnant Lyrics
Sliver deceit
Speaking in tongues
Deft as a surgeon's knife
Carving through bone

Pregnant with doubt
You figured out
Tricks of the trade to make whisper a shout
Mouthful of sweets
Rotting your teeth
Lift up the rug and sweep it underneath

You were dreaming when you don't believe

Pregnant with doubt
You figured out
Tricks of the trade to make whisper a shout
Mouth full of sweets
Rotting your teeth
Lift up the rug and sweep it underneath

You were dreaming when you don't believe
Sliver deceit
Speaking in tongues
Deft as a surgeon's knife
Carving through boneEmbed
