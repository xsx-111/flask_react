God, Make Up Your Mind Lyrics
Backseat of your family station wagon
Listening Nina Simone
100 years of solitude
And only 12 years old

God, make up your mind
God, make up your mind
Do you wanna play fair?
Or should I take what's mine?

Your mom is calling out, 'look at the Grand Canyon'
Camilla couldn't care less
Gaze into the hole
Your stomach feels the emptiness of death

God, make up your mind
God, make up your mind
Do you wanna play fair?
Or should I take what's mine?
Like everyone else

From New York to New Orleans, played alphabet
Kansas to Boise, won the battleship
Memorized the capitals, crossword puzzles
Drew a picture of a cat laying dead in the street
Daydream about my real dad back in California
Elephant in your brain
Reminding you you've got to make a choice
Wraps his arms around you slow
'Cause you tense up like an armadillo

God, make up your mind
God, make up your mind
Do you wanna play fair?
Or should I take what's mine?
Like everyone else

Why ain't my teacher on a street sign?
He's done so much more than politicians, dead musicians
You wanna help someone you gotta be a no one
That's what I figured out the cat in the street meant
You gotta make up your mind
Make up your mind
Make up your mindEmbed
