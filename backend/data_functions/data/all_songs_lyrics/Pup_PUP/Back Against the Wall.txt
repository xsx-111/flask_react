Back Against the Wall Lyrics
Now you find out
Yeah, your back's against the wall
If I'm a burnout
Might as well just burn it all

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

I don't listen much no more
I don't listen anymore
Yeah they ask me why

Now you find out
Yeah, your back's against the wall
If I'm a burnout
Might as well just burn it all

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

I don't listen much these days
I don't listen anyways
Yeah, they ask me why
Now you find out
Yeah, your back's against the wall
If I'm a burnout
Might as well just burn it all
Now in hindsight
You know we couldn't ask for more
In the limelight
I feel better than ever before1Embed
