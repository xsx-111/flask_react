Mabu Lyrics
I went down to the water (Oh-oh-oh)
With the help of my father
Out of the lake in mid-June
I pulled my car, Mabu
I need an engine that runs

It came down to the wire (Oh-oh-oh)
Put the pump to the tire (Oh-oh-oh)
It gets me hi-igh-igh-igh-igh
It makes her go-o-o-o

Now that she's gone so soon
I need a car like Mabu
And you know she'll come around
Oh-oh-oh, I need an engine that runs

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I drive my car through lakes and lagoons
Oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I drive my car, my car Mabu, oh oh oh-oh
And I know, when she's gone, I swear I'll change
I need a car (I miss her anyway)
I need an engine that runsEmbed
