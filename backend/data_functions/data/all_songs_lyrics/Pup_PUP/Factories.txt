Factories Lyrics
I built this life for you
With my own two hands
You've been sneakin' around
You've been with another man
And I hope you know
Bloody well what you've done to me
When I come home
From the factory

I'll make a plan
Baby, you know I'm a jealous man
And what goes around comes around
You took the car, said you're leavin' town

We can play hide and go seek
But baby, I'm playin' for keeps
And down by the Don Valley Creek
The water is dirty and deep
Leave you under the overpass
With the broken glass
By the factories

Far as I'm concerned
You had it all, and you'll get what you deserve
'Cause what goes around comes around
And I'll slip away without a sound
And they will track me through the night
And in the dawn
Oh, they'll hang me for what I have done
Baby, it's alright
I will be seeing you soon
When the floor of the gallows
Drops away, I will think of you
Baby, it's alright
I will be seeing you soon
When the floor of the gallows
Drops away, I will think of you

When there's nothin' left to lose
Shave my hair and shine my shoes
Hangin' from the noose
Any last words? Better say it now
I guess I was right
What goes around comes around4Embed
