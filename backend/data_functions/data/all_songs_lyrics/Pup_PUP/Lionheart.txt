Lionheart Lyrics
Oh, lionheart
Where have you gone?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
All that you said
But you always lie
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, lionheart

Oh, lionblood
Flowin' through my veins
(Whoa-oh, oh-oh)
You said you'd try
If I promised to do the same
(Ay-ay, ay-ay)
(Whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, lionheart
Oh, lionheart

(Ba bah ba-da-ba-dap bah)
Good luck
(Ba bah ba-da-ba-dap bah bah)
And good times
(Ba bah ba-da-ba-dap bah)
Let's get fucked
(Ba bah ba-da-ba-dap bah bah)
Let's get high
(Ba bah ba-da-ba-dap bah)
Good luck
(Ba bah ba-da-ba-dap bah)
But don't smile
(Ba bah ba-da-ba-dap bah)
'Cause I know
(Ba bah bah)
You got a lionheart!
Oh, lionheart
Oh, lionheart1Embed
