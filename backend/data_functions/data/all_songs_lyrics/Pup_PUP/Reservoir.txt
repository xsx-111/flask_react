Reservoir Lyrics
There's a path to the top of the mountain
You walk forever just to meet me at the reservoir
Outta luck, outta money
Take your clothes off, meet me at the reservoir

Meet me at the reservoir
Meet me at the reservoir

I guess you live and you learn
I guess you'll get what you deserve

You're on your own
I'm lettin' go at the reservoir
Sinkin' like a stone
We had it all and it fell apart

You only want it when you're bored with the quarry
I only want it when I'm wasted at the reservoir
Outta touch, outta lovin'
The engines runnin' and I'm wasted at the reservoir
My lungs are killin' me, I didn't even get high
Forget longevity, we're just tryna get by
It isn't apathy, I just don't care if I die
My lungs are killin' me, I didn't even get high
You're on your own
I'm lettin' go at the reservoir
Sinkin' like a stone
We had it all and it fell apart
What did you expect?
At the reservoir
Sinkin' like a stone
I'm lettin' go
It's never pleasure, it's always work


Meet me at the reservoir
Meet me at the reservoir

I guess you live and you learn
I guess you'll get what you deserve

You're on your own
I'm lettin' go at the reservoir
Sinkin' like a stone
We had it all and it fell apart
What did you expect?
At the reservoir
I'm sinkin' like a stone
I'm lettin' go
And I will stay afloat1Embed
