Dark Days Lyrics
This endless night
This funeral dirge
We celebrate life
At the end of the earth
When everything is gone
There'll be nothin' left to lose
The ice is closing in
And nothing will remain
We took what we could get
And we burned it anyway
With all those secrets
We swore we'd take 'em to the grave
The light will falter and we'll fade
And in the darkness, we'll say

"This winter hasn't been so rough
Oh, it was cold, but still, it wasn't cold enough
To freeze the blood beneath my spine
And at least I survived"

We're sleepin' through the days
And sinkin' like a ship
We're wastin' away
Bit by bit
Everyone is gone
And everything is changed
It won't ever be the same
And when it's over, we'll say
"This winter hasn't been so rough
Oh, it was cold, but still, it wasn't cold enough
To freeze the blood beneath my spine
And at least I survived"

We've had some dark days
We're in the thick of it now
And when the ice breaks
There will be no one around
We've had some dark days
We're in the thick of it now
And when the ice breaks
There will be no one around

This winter hasn't been so rough
Oh, it was cold, but it wasn't cold enough
To freeze the blood beneath my spine
And at least I survived
This winter hasn't been so rough
(We've had some dark days)
Oh, it was cold, but still, it wasn't cold enough
(We're in the thick of it now)
To freeze the blood beneath my spine
(And when the ice breaks)
And at least I survived2Embed
