The Circle Married the Line Lyrics
I know it'll need to go from good to worse
Living in the past begins the ending first
All I want is a horizon line
Get some clarity following signs

I'll keep on the path that leads up to the clearing
Keep some distance while the words comes in so near and
Then I'll head out to horizon lines
Get some clarity oceanside

Realize what you know that you know by now that

First light was
Last light was
Alright when
The circle married the line
First light was
Last light was
Alright when
The circle married the line

Even from away he is near me
Making me unendingly teary
Makes me remember the things that I forgot
It's as much what it is as what it is not
In a room sleeping so peacefully
Fall away from him to be less than lee
All we need is a horizon line
Get some clarity following signs

Realize what you know that you know by now
Realize what you know that you know by now that

First light was
Last light was
Alright when
The circle married the line
First light was
Last light was
Alright when
The circle married the line
First light was
Last light was
Alright when
The circle married the line
First light was
Last light was
Alright when
The circle married the line
First light was
Last light was
Alright when
The circle married the line
First light was
Last light was
Alright when
The circle married the lineEmbed
