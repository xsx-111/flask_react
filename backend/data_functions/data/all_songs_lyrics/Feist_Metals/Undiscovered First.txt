Undiscovered First Lyrics
I had what I thought
Were clear open eyes
Bright blue
Vision not of a light
Carrying pictures
To lay on you

Close up eyes
Let them in
To a mind opening
It's the edge of love
You can't unthink a thought
Either it's there or not

Shadows of the mountain
Don't tell of what's on earth
The breadth and the height
Of an undiscovered first

Now hopeful mountaineers
Climb up to eclipse
The light of the old sun
Cause it's been said
The two would know
Once the two'd been told
Shadows of the mountain
Don't tell of what's on earth
The breadth and the height
Of an undiscovered first
Shadows of the mountain
Don't tell of what's in store
The height and the breadth
Is it wrong to want more?


Is this the right mountain
For us to climb?
Is this the way to live
For you to be mine?
Is this the right river
For us to forge?
Is this the way to live
For me to be yours?
Is this the way to live
For me to be yours?
Is this the way to live?
Is it wrong to want more?
(Is this the way to live
For me to be yours?
Is this the way to live?
Is it wrong to want more?)1Embed
