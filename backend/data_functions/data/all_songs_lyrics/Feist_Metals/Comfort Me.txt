Comfort Me Lyrics
When you comfort me
It doesn't bring me comfort actually
When you comfort me

True life in haiku
It balances the phrase out of the blue
The meaning's shown to you

What does sadness see?
The mirror has a mirror in its teeth
That's what sadness sees

Big sky, tiny bird
And when the paragraph betrays the word
Big sky, tiny bird

Hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo
While you helped me up
I held my calendar out like a cup
While you helped me up

Make it all about me
I want to hold the blame to guillotine
Make it all blame-free

Hee-hee-hee
Hee-hee hee-hee-hee, hee-hee
Hee-hee-hee
Hee-hee hee-hee-hee, hee-hee

Na na na na-na
Na-na-na-na-na na na na na-na
Na na na na-na
Na na na na-na
Na-na-na-na-na na na na na-na
Na na na na-na

When you comfort me
It doesn't bring me comfort actuallyEmbed
