Cicadas and Gulls Lyrics
Cicadas and gulls
A scrape on the hull
The land and the sea
Are distant from me
I'm in the sky, sky, sky
I'm in the sky

Thoughts are like pearls
When flags are unfurled
When we're in the dark
I'll ride you like the ark
Because you're mine, mine, mine
Because you're mine

Maps can be poems
When you're on your own
And distance is Braille
And all that entails
I'm in the sky, sky, sky
I'm in the sky
I'm in the sky

Empty as a page
As high as the stage
As full as the room
When we're in the spoonEmbed
