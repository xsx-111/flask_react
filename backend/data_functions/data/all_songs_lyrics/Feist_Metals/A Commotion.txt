A Commotion Lyrics
It flickered to light
It turned broke what was right
It got the roots by the hair
What was was no longer there

It blocked out the sun
It climbed up the stairs
And then it slipped through the cracks
I wasn't watching my back

A commotion
A commotion
A commotion
A commotion

If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart

It stalked through the rooms
And then it tore the sheets off the bed
It ripped the books off the shelf
It turned heaven to hell
It held me down tight
It took all my fight
It broke all the windows
It came flame from the kindle

A commotion
A commotion
A commotion
A commotion

If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart
The grudge has still got your heart
The grudge has still got your heart
The grudge has still got your heartEmbed
