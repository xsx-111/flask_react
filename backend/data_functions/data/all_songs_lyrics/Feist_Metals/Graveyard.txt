Graveyard Lyrics
The graveyard
The graveyard
All full of light
The only age
The beating heart
Is empty of life

Dirt and grass
The shadow hall
The Moon sails past
Blood as ice is an empty crisis
Lonely and last

Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life

Roots and lines
Roots and lines
Our family tree is a home
From there we climb
The golden hill
Call and they will
Eternally
I held your hand
The giant wand
Alto low song
And history
Begins to be
Blue and brown eyed

Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life


Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to lifeEmbed
