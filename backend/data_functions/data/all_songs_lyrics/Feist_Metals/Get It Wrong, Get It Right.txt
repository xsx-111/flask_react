Get It Wrong, Get It Right Lyrics
Wind on the fields blowing your hair
Wheat of gold, wheat of gold, wheat of gold
Wheat of gold, hand to hold, hand to hold

Come to the hill, got a nest to build
String and grass, string and grass, string and grass
String and grass, leave the past, leave the past

Climb up to the lookout, tops of the trees
Little road, little road, little road
Little road, come and go, come and go


River dam, lake fills up the land
Skipping stones, skipping stones, skipping stones
Skipping stones, build a home, build a home

Cold outside, warm by the fire
Get it wrong, get it wrong, get it wrong
Get it right, get it right, get it rightEmbed
