Caught a Long Wind Lyrics
Little bird, have you got a key?
Unlock the lock inside of me
Where will you go to keep yourself afloat?
Feeling old until the wings unfolded
Caught me a long wind

Where will we go
To keep ourselves afloat?

I caught a long wind
A long life wind

I got to know the sky
But it didn't know me
Got to see the land
And land on top of the sea
And be the bird, be the key
And now the current tells
What the wave withheld
And then the lightning sang
Of where the light would land
Where will you go
To keep yourself afloat?

I caught a long wind
A long life wind

Like a swallow
A night owl
A little chickadee
Sad sparrow
Good morning bird
Good nightingale
I took a deep breath
And caught a long wind2Embed
