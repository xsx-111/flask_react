How Come You Never Go There Lyrics
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

I went up to the window
Lightning banging on the cymbals
I ripped into the night
Came storm into your eyes

My horse had worked the fields too long
My bear had lost his innate calm
It's true enough we're not at peace
But peace is never what it seems

Our love is not the light it was
When I walk inside the dark I'm gone
While we look for where it went
It's only echoes in the valley of love

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

We waste time on blame and weak revenge
Waste energy on projections
We're living proof we've gotta let go
And stop looking through the halo

We carry on as if the time is through
You carry on as if I don't love you
And so we find the way is out
To cut the heart out of the doubt now

The room's full but hearts are empty
Like the letters never sent me
Your words are like a lasso
But you're an instrumental tune

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?1Embed
