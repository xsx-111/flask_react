Bittersweet Melodies Lyrics
Whispers in the grass
Under slow-dancing trees
Birds were telling me stories
Saying you were meant for me
With their

Bittersweet melody
Like a sweet memory
Bittersweet melodies
Can't go back and can't go on without those
Bittersweet memories

Creaking kitchen floor
Snow slips under the door
Tiny speakers were singing
Telephone always ringing
With those

Bittersweet melodies
Like a sweet memory
Bittersweet melodies
Can't go back and can't go on
I remember us
Before we turned to dust
Just what our feelings were all about
When we still could trust
In our hearts

Bittersweet memory
Like a sweet melody
Bittersweet memories
Can't go back and can't go on
Both of us singing that same old song
Without
Bittersweet memories
Like a sweet melody
Bittersweet memories
And it seems oh so long since those
Bittersweet melodies played for meEmbed
