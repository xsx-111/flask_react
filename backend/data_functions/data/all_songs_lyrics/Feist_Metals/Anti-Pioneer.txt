Anti-Pioneer Lyrics
Start with colours
They always get away with attitude
But they'll try to convince you of your mood
And what you want they'll give it to you
But it's only therapy, that's all they do

And for a year
She was anti-pioneer
Singing sappy songs
About what went wrong
Two years before
But even now when the false is true
When I call me you

When the flag changes colours the language knows
When the month changes numbers it's time to go
When the flag changes colours the language knows
When the month changes numbers it's time to go home

Anti-pioneer
Anti-pioneer
Anti-pioneer
Anti-pioneer
And for a year
She was anti-pioneer
The past arrived too late
To change the future's fate, ooh
But even now when the false is true
And living colours seem possible to you

When the flag changes colours the language knows
When the month changes numbers it's time to go
When the flag changes colours the language knows
When the month changes numbers it's time to go home2Embed
