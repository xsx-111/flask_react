Mascara LyricsThere's a belt of sun dripping through a porthole
In a set design
Can you read your name?
It's been so long since we bloomed from the inside
So where have you been
Since you fell off the flat edge
Of the world under an ugly sky
You've been lying right there
Claiming you dance under the moonlight
A song but is the flesh and blood
To what you think is a song but is the flesh and blood
Of a dismembered groin that's been bleeding
For thousands of your years
You felt like history in your thighs
(You get four red candles)
You're the one that makes me realize
(On the table with your painted fire eyes)
Big water flowing through to tomorrow
(Blue to your addiction)
Apples and cake must have been your steak
(That forced you to drink your gallon of wine)
Your little duck house
(But the smile is in an erection)
Makes me feel like I'm alive
You're hidden by your wooden legs
(You're my kind, you're my kind)
You always make me feel like a moon in my life, all the time
(Staring down at the world's edge)
It always makes me feel good to know you're alive
(Lying down by the whirlpool)
You're wrapping in your tights
(Finally realized you must have bitten your snake, your little guy)
I've been insane, well the time is slow
(I've been to a society where you won't miss those feelings, so you can't feel the sunshine)
(And if you see me roaming the hillside won't you come along?)
The Pope don't matter when the pawn is your sea, don't you agree?
(It's a hard road to the top of yourself, you'll always be alone)
When you're around I'm wound around your thumb
(I like you in my life, it makes me feel good just to know I can love someone like you)
You wanna be numb inside the gun
(They'll make it hard for you choose. I can understand, but
When you see creation coming you close your eyes)
All your billboards are one big fight
Against the baby inside that you've mistaken for pain
(And to you, I'm sure, it's no surprise that I could be one of the dead. Thank god my underwear's full of lead without you)
