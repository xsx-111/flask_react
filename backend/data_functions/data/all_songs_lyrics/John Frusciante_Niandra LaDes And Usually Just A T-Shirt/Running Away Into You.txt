Running Away Into You LyricsDrive...
Up and down through water
Live where you're poor
Between snores
And sighing babies go to work
Crying inverted love to the back of the room
Play him a tune, down low if the sun could melt like snow
I would run to you and flow into a cloud
While running away into you, while running away into you
While running away into you, while running away into you
While running away into you, while running away into you
While running away into you, while running away into you
While running away into you, while running away into you
While running away into you, while running away into you...Embed
