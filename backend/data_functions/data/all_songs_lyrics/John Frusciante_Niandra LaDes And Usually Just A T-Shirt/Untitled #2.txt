Untitled #2 LyricsShadows been word
One win a hand
To sell it through their thick little back let clock
It's a..
It's a passage way to drive, walk or run through
Or the wind and water can carry me
I expect what didn't happen just now to have just happened
It lifted me up, part of the quan skies one
And body betrayal that's designed by the shadows
Now that forward or up or down climb to top

It's the bottom so there is no rush
And you don't get tired
Just knows, when it burn the creeves that's around you
Trying to pretend..
Burying it wherever it grooves itself to the rage of life
That balance
And move like you do cause you do it for them
I've been followed and I've been so wrong
Mistakenly killed for being so thin
I conflict inside out
The song of trash that can rise in depression
It's closing
Love
So it grooves
I assume that whenever slides in her own ground spending life
So you flip each day to the night
That holds you soft in position
Folding pain tightly so it knows what it means
For it silent vowels to be all that bleeds
Like you knows the sides
Or what it needs to keep trying
And it didn't mean to be N. I. A. P
My body is light
Cause the weight of whatever's carrying me through the weak
Traps around
That bleed
I've stepped anyway not falling my being on my way to be..
I'll never go empty for thanks..
To have thee
Sitting around feels like running
And crowds..
Dangle me from their thighs widening across where life is here
Cause my love is crying
I'll share the way I've lost
Cause I'm a pretend me
And I'm real cause I can hit me, softly
And bleed
Blood I can hear
Cause I'm here now and it's far from me
Fall back into the ground
Flip dive through its holes
Then in the whole thing
Landing is unimportant
As long as I'm giving the thing that swirls
Like selling dreams to cannabis
Telling too to jump free..Embed
