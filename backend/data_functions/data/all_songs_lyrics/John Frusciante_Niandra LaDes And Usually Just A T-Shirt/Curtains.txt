Curtains LyricsThe curtains are made for moving
'Cause you know sometimes you're not always there
You don't need it now
Your head's shaped like a cow
'Til all is here
The world's just a sphere
No bigger than the balls you suck
Hey you with your hat down
Don't you know that it can't be where it's always at?
You've all been always there
Your head's shaped like a pear
You search through the lights
Instead of jumped in the pie
Of life that you sliced 'til it's just right
You're so often seen along
The west side wheel of the mills
That you steal to get around
The curtain of the slobs
It's always made you feel the best
You always need less and less
Of the casual forces
That lead you away from the nest
I know your face
It's all out place
I know your face
It's all out of placeEmbed
