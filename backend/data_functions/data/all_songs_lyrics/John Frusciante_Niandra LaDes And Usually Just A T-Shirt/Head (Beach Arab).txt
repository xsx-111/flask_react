Head (Beach Arab) LyricsI want to be there for you
With you my soul's gonna follow the sun
Your head can always be in between, you gotta clean it
Hey, smile
Hey, smile
Please tell me lies, and when you gape I'll do it
I just got to say I follow your way, yeah
Head, head is like the voice
Head lies me down1Embed
