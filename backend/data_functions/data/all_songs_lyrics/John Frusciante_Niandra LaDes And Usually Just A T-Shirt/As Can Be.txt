As Can Be Lyrics
One, two, three, four

When you got a clean smile
You can walk with style
He can be naked with no brain
In your pussy, I'm cummin'
And I love you
And always had to thank God I found you
Beautiful talkin', well, it was to me
Do you see? There's no more me
I'm happy as can be

I'm happy as can be, yeah, yeah
I'm happy as can be
I'm happy as can be3Embed
