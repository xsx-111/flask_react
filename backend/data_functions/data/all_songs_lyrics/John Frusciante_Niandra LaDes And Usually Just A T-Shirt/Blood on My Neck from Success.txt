Blood on My Neck from Success LyricsUhh, shoot the date spines
Does fine in the winter
Occasionally fine
Squint to feel sprite
I've got blood on my neck, from success
Ohh, clearly known corner
SCARED!
What do I need?
Uhh, shoot the date spines
Does fine in the winter
Occasionally mine
Splint to fit sprite, I'm new
I've got blood on my neck, from success
From cleared them on the part of stump
Well, I can be
They put me to sleep
On to the next thing
I'm asleep
Because I'm being
You scare me, find me, of me
And I flee
Gotta feed a ghost
Do what they're supposed to
Say what they're supposed to
Now I've got to
Now I've got you
Shower me with your life
Ah, what's the fight?
WHAT'S THE FIGHT?Embed
