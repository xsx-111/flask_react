Big Takeover LyricsNo one dared to show for that shower
When no body turned to be clean
Was not even touched by the water
Just another Nazi scheme, yeah
The big takeover, yeah
My, the big takeover, yeah
All throughout this so called nation
Prepare yourself for that final quest
The world is through with it's own integration
Just another Nazi test, yeah
The big takeover, yeah
My, the big takeover, yeah
So believe me when I say
There's no hope for the USA
The world is through with it's own integration
Just another Nazi test, yeah
The big takeover, yeah
My, the big takeover, yeahEmbed
