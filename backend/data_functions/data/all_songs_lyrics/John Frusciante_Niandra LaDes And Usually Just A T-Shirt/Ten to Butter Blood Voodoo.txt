Ten to Butter Blood Voodoo LyricsExclamations feel
Before you set to conceal
She loves the man you've told
Did you see me flying in coach?
Hey, sister, it's unreal
The way I take it to the sky my automobile
Could you show them the ten
To hear about heaven's sins
Your eyes take it to the sky
Yellow and zebras
Voice 1: Fly
Voice 2: Fall
Your skies taken to the flies
And next is found west
Feeling the best
Hey-la
Hey-la
