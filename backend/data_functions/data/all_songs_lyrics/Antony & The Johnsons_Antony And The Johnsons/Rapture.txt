Rapture Lyrics(Rapture)
Eyes are falling
Lips are falling
Hair is falling to the ground
Slowly, softly
Falling, falling
Down in silence to the ground
All the world is falling, falling
All the blue
From me and you
Tear drops falling to the ground
Tear drops
I'm talkin' 'bout your tear drops
For instance, oh my mama
She's been falling
Falling down for quite some time
And oh my papa
He's been falling
Falling down for quite some time
Oh, my friends
I've watched them falling
Falling softly to the ground
Like the leaves
The leaves are falling
Down in silence to the ground
Is this the rapture?
Is this the rapture?
Why don't you tell me?
Is this the rapture?
Is this the rapture?
Our father who art in heaven
For the kingdom, the power, the glory, yours
Now and foreverEmbed
