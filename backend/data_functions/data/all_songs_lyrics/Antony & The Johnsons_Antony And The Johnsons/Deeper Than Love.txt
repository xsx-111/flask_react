Deeper Than Love Lyrics(Fall deeper)
(Fall deeper)
My heart is broken
Here in the cup of my hands
From between cracked fingers
Old blood spills
I had to move on, baby
For when I tasted my own tears
They were too sweet
And I knew that I had come too close
And I have tried to shine in the darkness
Entertaining vanities in vain
Fall deeper
Fall deeper
My heart is broken
Here in the cup of my hands
From between cracked fingers
Old blood spills
I had to move on, baby
For when I tasted my own tears
They were too sweet
Then I knew that I had come too close
And I have tried to shine in the darkness
Entertaining vanities in vain
But now won't you come with me
As I open my eyes
And hold on
Hold on
And let go
Let go
Let the virus live a life
Hold on
And hold on
And let go
Let go
And fall deeper
Even than love
Even than love
Hold on
And fall deeper
Even than love
Even than love
Even than love
Even than love1Embed
