Hitler in My Heart LyricsAs I search for a piece of kindness
And I find Hitler in my heart
And he is whispering
"As sure as love will spring
From the Well of Blood in Vain, oh Jew!
The Well of Blood in Vain!"
Woah, la, la, la, la, la, la
And I fell into a deeper precipice
With mouths of rapists
Jaws dropped down
Jaws dropped down
Jaws dropped
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Don't punish me
For wanting your love inside of me
Don't punish me
For wanting your love inside of me
And I find Hitler in my heart
From the corpses flowers grow
And I find Hitler in my heart
From the corpses flowers grow
And I find Hitler in my heart
From the corpses flowers grow
Flowers grow
From the corpses flowers grow
Flowers growEmbed
