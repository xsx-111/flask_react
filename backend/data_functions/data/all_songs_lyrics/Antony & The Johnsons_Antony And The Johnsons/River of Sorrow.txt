River of Sorrow LyricsThere is a black river
It passes by my window
And late at night
All dolled up like Christ
I walk the water
Between the piers
Singing
Oh, river of sorrow
River of time, river
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time
For we all know the baby has expired
Long ago she was pulled from the mire
And no precious liar or well-wisher
Can return the love that was stolen
So oh, river of sorrow
River of time, river
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time
Can you see the light
At the end of the dark passageway?
Take me with you towards the light
Into the darkness passing over the faces in the river
Hear me, I'm whispering in your ear
Oh, river of sorrow
Oh, river of time
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time
Oh, river of sorrow
Oh, river of time
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this timeEmbed
