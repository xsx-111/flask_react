Divine LyricsGoodbye, baby
Baby, goodbye
Divine, oh Divine
Falling like a picture of time
Oh, he was the Mother of America
He was my self-determined guru
Myself, I hold your big fat heart in my hands
Well I hold your bleeding heart in my hands
A supernova
A flame on fire
Shining in the darkness
Did someone mention a rapture?
Well I turn to think of you
Who walked the way with so much pain?
Who holds the mirror up to fools?
And I'll murder the ingrates
Who stand in our way
And I'll swallow shit, laughing
On my bed of hay
And I hold your burning heart in my hands
And I hold your burning heart in my hands
A supernova
A flame on fire
Shining in the darkness
Divine
Divine
A supernova
A flame on fire
Shining in the darkness1Embed
