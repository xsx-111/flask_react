Cripple and the Starfish LyricsMr. Muscle forcing bursting
Stingy thingy into little me, me, me
But just "ripple" said the cripple
As my jaw dropped to the ground
Smile, smile
It's true I always wanted love to be
Hurtful
And it's true I always wanted love to be
Filled with pain
(And bruises)
Yes, so Cripple-Pig was happy
Screamed, "I just completely love you
There's no rhyme or reason
I'm changing like the seasons
Watch, I'll even cut off my finger
It'll grow back like a starfish
It'll grow back like a starfish
It'll grow back like a starfish"
Mr. Muscle, gazing boredly
And he, checking time, did punch me
And I sighed and bleeded like a windfall
Happy bleedy, happy bruisy
I am very happy
So please hit me
I am very, very happy
So please hurt me
I am very happy
So please hit me
I am very, very happy
So come on and hurt me
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfishEmbed
