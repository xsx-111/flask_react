Rock-N-Roll Victim Lyrics
Your face is sweaty and your eyes are red
The bass drums pounding steady in your head!
You roll yourself another stick of grass
Jump on the seat and start to move your ass!

You're a rock 'n roll victim and I know this is true
Cause I'm a rock 'n roll victim too

The only world that ain't dull is your own
And that's a room inside your parent's home!
The wall is covered with the stars you know
You just can't live without your stereo!

You're a rock 'n roll victim and I know this is true
Cause I'm a rock 'n roll victim too

Sometimes we say things that we really feel
Sometimes we say things that aren't really real!
Establishment don't want no part of us
Except to make themselves a real quick buck!
You're a rock 'n roll victim and I know this is true
Cause I'm a rock 'n roll victim too
You're a rock 'n roll victim and I know this is true
Cause I'm a rock 'n roll victim tooEmbed
