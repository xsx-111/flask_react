Let The World Turn LyricsIf your dream is shattered
Pick up the glass
Don't let your head keep running
Whatever is behind you
Leave it past
Can't you see what's coming
Let the world turn, let the world turn around
Let the world turn, let the world turn around
On a wild trip, on a wild trip around
Let the world turn, let the world turn around
On a wild trip, on a wild trip around
Will you be glad when they let you off
Oh but you don't know really where you've been
Make believing what they think is real
Just tell me what exactly have they seen
Can't hold on to their established mold
Because the greed will stop their ways
Could have been just like them years ago
But then I wouldn't be livin' life this day
If breakthroughs keep occurring
Let them in
You know that time is all we're made of
The world will keep on spinning
Let it﻿ spin
You know that time will all be made up
Sent the world on it' wild wild trip
It's too far gone to even stop it now
Got your life you better live it now
Before someone will have to show you how
Will you be glad when they let you off
Oh but you won't know really where you've been
Make﻿ believe in what they think is real
Just tell me what exactly have they seen1Embed
