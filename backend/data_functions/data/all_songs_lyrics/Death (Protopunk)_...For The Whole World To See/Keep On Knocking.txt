Keep On Knocking LyricsIf I can remember
It was you who didn't wanna see my face
If I can remember
It was you who put me in my place
You gettin' down and out
Now you wanna' be with me
Well I got news for you
That ain't the way it's gonna' be
You thought that me and you
Were just a big game
But now you're back for more
And I done forgot your name
I'm sorry baby
It had to end like this
You know we tried
Baby we just missed

Keep on knockin', keep on knockin' on the door
Keep on knockin', keep on knockin' on the door
Keep on knockin', keep on knockin' on the door
Keep on knockin', keep on knockin' on the door
Keep on knockin', keep on knockin' on the door
I bet you're wondering
How I got along without you
For your information
So many things I could do
If what you're hoping
That what I'm sayin' ain't true
Well then baby
Then find somebody new
Keep on knockin', keep on knockin' on the door
Keep on knockin', keep on knockin' on the door
Keep on knockin', keep on knockin' on the door
Keep on knockin', keep on knockin' on the door
Keep on knockin', keep on knockin' on the doorEmbed
