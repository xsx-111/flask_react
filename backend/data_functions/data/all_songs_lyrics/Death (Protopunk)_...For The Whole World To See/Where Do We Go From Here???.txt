Where Do We Go From Here??? LyricsAll you timeless children
Choking gangsters and flashbacks
Trying to get ahead
What makes you think I can see you
What makes you think I believe you
Dreams 'side my bed
Have you heard the news lately
Were sad (?)
Shot, that's on the pass
All the dreams were flying
All the love was dying
Earth was coming fast

Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
All you false pretenders
And you freaky contenders
Trying to be the first
In my own opinion
You are not defending
You, you are the worst
Made the world a circus
And you're trying to curse us
Cruel, he knows no bounds
But we won't let you beat us
No, we won't let you cheat us
It's only one time around

Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
If you find it amusing
And the world in the music
Take a closer look
If you found permission
In the dreams you're wishing
It's all the time you took

Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from hereEmbed
