Elected Lyrics
I'm top prime cut of meat, I'm your choice
I wanna be elected
I'm your yankee doodle dandy in a gold Rolls Royce
I wanna be elected
Kids want a savior, they don't need a fake
I wanna be elected
We're all gonna rock to the rules that I make
I wanna be elected

Elected, elected, yeah
Respected, yeah
Elected
Good evening Mr & Mrs America
And all ships at sea
This candidate is taking the country by storm

I never lied to you, I've always been cool
I wanna be elected
I gotta get the vote, and I told you 'bout school
I wanna be elected
Elected, elected
Hallelujah
I wanna be selected
Everyone in the United States of America
We're gonna win this one
Take the country by storm
We're gonna be elected
You and me together, young and strong
We're gonna be elected

Elected, elected
Respected, selected
Call collected
I wanna be elected
And if I am elected
I promise the formation of a new party
A third party, the Wild Party!
I know we have problems
We got problems right here in Central City
We have problems on the North
South, East and West
New York City, Saint Louis, Philadelphia
Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago
Everybody has problems
And personally, I don't careEmbed
