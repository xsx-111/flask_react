Slick Black Limousine LyricsWell, I hope I die in a slick black limousine
Oh, come along momma gonna take a look at me
Gonna fly though the city, gonna fly to the sea
Gonna fly my, my, my, my, my

Well, I get first prize
I remember it quite clear
Gonna fly though the city, gonna fly to the sea
Gonna fly yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yow
I hope I die in a slick black limousine
Yeah, come along momma gonna take a, take a look at me
We're gonna fly to the ocean
Gonna fly to the sea
We're gonna fly yay, yay yeah
Ninety miles an hour
Swervin' all over the road
Hundred miles an hour
My hand's on the radio
Baby's in the back seat
Bompin' all over the road
No one, no one touch my limousine
Yeah, the Lord, my limousine
Yeah, the Lord, my limousine
Yeah, the Lord, my limousine
Now stuck up livin' with a Model T
My machine, my machineEmbed
