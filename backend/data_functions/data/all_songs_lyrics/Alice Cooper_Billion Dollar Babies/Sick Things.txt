Sick Things Lyrics
Sick things in cars
Rotate round my stars
Sick things, my things
My pets, my things

I love you things I see as much as you love me
You things are heavenly when you come worship me
You things are chilled with fright, for I am out tonight
You fill me with delight, you wet my appetite
I eat my things
What love it brings
Come here my things
And don't fear my little things

I love you things I see as much as you love me
You things are heavenly when you come worship me
You things are thrilled with fright, for I am out tonight
You things are paradise, you whet my appetite
Sick things in cartridge
Tapes my stars
Sick things, pretty things
Play things, my things
I love the things I see as much as they love me
You things are heavenly when you come worship me
You things are chilled with fright, for I am out tonight
You things are paradise, you whet my appetite
