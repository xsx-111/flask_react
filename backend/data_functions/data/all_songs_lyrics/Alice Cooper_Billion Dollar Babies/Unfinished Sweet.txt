Unfinished Sweet Lyrics
Oh, candy everywhere got chocolate in my hair
Aching to get me
Sticky sweet suckers in Halloween air
Aching to get me
Saint Vitus dance on my molars tonight
Aching to get me
Aching to get me, get me, oh

I take it to the doc, I guess he ought to know
La, da, da, da, da
Which ones can stay and which ones gotta go
La, da, da, da, da
He looks in my mouth and then he starts to gloat
He says my teeth are okay
But my gums got to go
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I come off the gas but I'm still seeing spies
Aching to get me
And I can see them all through a pair of glassy eyes
Aching to get me
De Sade's gonna live in my mouth tonight
La, da, da, da, da
And the rotten tooth fairy is satisfied
La, da, da, da, da
Aching to get me, get me, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, uh, uh, god!Embed
