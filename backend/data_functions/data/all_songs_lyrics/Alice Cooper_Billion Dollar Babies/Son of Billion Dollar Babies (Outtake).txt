Son of Billion Dollar Babies (Outtake) LyricsPlease clean the plate, dear
The Lord up there can see ya
Don't you know people are starving in Korea?
Alcohol and razor blades and poisons and needles
Kindergarten people - they use 'em, they need 'em
The over-indulgent machines were their children
There wasn't a way down on Earth there to cool 'em
'Cause they look just like humans at Kresges and Woolworths
But decadent brains were at work to destroy
Brats in battalions were ruling the streets
Sayin' generation landslide close the gap between 'em
And I laugh to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies
Lada da da da
Militant mothers hiding in the basement
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets
Molotov milk bottles thrown from pink high chairs
As Mothers' Lib burned birth certificate papers
And I laugh to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies
Lada da da daEmbed
