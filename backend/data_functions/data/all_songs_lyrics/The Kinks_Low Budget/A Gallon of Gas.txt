A Gallon of Gas LyricsI've been waiting for years to buy a brand new Cadillac
But now that I've got one I want to send it right back
I can't afford the gas for my luxury limousine
But even if I had the dough, no one's got no gasoline
I went to my local dealer to see if he could set me straight
He said there's a little gas going but you have to wait
But he offered some red hot speed and some really high grade hash
But a gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere for any amount of cash
I can score you some coke and some grade one grass
But I can't get a gallon of gas
I've got some downers, some speed, all the drugs that you need
But I can't get a gallon of gas
There's no more left to buy and sell
There's no more oil left in the well
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere
For any amount of cash
(Two extra verses from long version:
I love your body-work, but you're really no use
How can I drive you when I got no juice?
Because it's stuck in neutral and my engine's got no speed
And the highways are deserted
And the air smells unnaturally clean
It's got power-assisted overdrive and carpets on the floor
But it's parked out front just like a dead dinosaur
And I'll be paying off the bank for 45 years or more
It should go 100 miles an hour
But it's never moved away from my door)
Who needs a car and a seven-forty-seven
When you can't buy a gallon of gas
Who needs a highway, an airport or a jet
When you can't get a gallon of gas
There's no more left to buy and sell
There's no more oil left in the well
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere
For any amount of cash
You can't buy a gallon of gasEmbed
