What Do you Think About Hell? Lyrics(Have a nice day...)
Everywhere, You're lookin'
But there's no place to hide
The strain on your face
You're on the downward side
The hands you crushed
On the way to the top
Smiling faces
As you face the drop
You're here at last
Won't you please come inside
What do you think about Hell?
Hell
The knife in your back
It only pays the debt
Now the vultures have gathered
For a pound of flesh
The countdown starts
Enjoy your last breath
You've been programmed
For the lingering death
Time to own up
It's the reader's reward
Now what do you think about Hell?
Hell
Dante's dream has come of age
And now we know
Did you think throughout your days
You'd get this low?
The night marks new reality
And you can't wake
You had the chance to change the course
Now meet your fate
Hell
The hands you crushed
On the way to the top
Smiling faces
As you face the drop
You're here at last
Won't you please come inside
Now what do you think about Hell?
Hell
Dante's dream has come of age
And now we know
Did you think throughout your days
You'd get this low?
Hell
Hell
Dante's dream has come of age
And now we know
Did you think throughout your days
You'd get this low?
Hell
Hell
Dante's dream has come of age
And now we know
Did you think throughout your days
You'd get this low?
The night marks new reality
And you can't wake
You had the chance to change the course
Now meet your fate
HellEmbed
