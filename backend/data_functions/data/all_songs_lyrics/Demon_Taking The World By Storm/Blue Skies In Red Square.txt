Blue Skies In Red Square LyricsWould you come and walk with me?
Would you let me call you friend?
We can stand out in the sunshine
Now the cold war's at an end
I can see behind the curtain
That you're really just like me
And comrade you just wanna live in peace
Well so do we
The ghosts of Lenin and of Kennedy were here
The world was waiting for a sign
And all around us, north and south and east and west
This was a new age for mankind
Now there's blue skies in Red Square
People dancin' everywhere
Now there's blue skies in Red Square
Children singin' everywhere
How I feel at home in Moscow
Just like London or New York
And at last we can communicate
Now we must learn to talk
I can see the flame of Glasnost
See it burning everywhere
And when your walls come tumbling down
We'll cossak in Times Square
The ghosts of Lenin and of Kennedy were here
The world was waiting for a sign
And all around us, north and south and east and west
This was a new age for mankind
Now there's blue skies in Red Square
People dancin' everywhere
Now there's blue skies in Red Square
Children singin' everywhere
-Solo-
Would you come and walk with me?
Would you let me call you friend?
We can stand out in the sunshine
Now the cold war's at an end
I can see behind the curtain
That you're really just like me
And comrade you just wanna live in peace
Well so do we
The ghosts of Lenin and of Kennedy were here
The world was waiting for a sign
And all around us, north and south and east and west
This was a new age for mankind
Now there's blue skies in Red Square
People dancin' everywhere
Now there's blue skies in Red Square
Children singin' everywhere
Now there's blue skies in Red Square
People dancin' everywhere
Now there's blue skies in Red Square
Children singin' everywhere
Now there's blue skies in Red Square
People dancin' everywhere
Now there's blue skies in Red Square
Children singin' everywhereEmbed
