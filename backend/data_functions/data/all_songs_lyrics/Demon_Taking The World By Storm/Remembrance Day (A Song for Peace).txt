Remembrance Day (A Song for Peace) LyricsEverywhere they gathered on that day
Poppies worn with pride
And in a land torn apart by hate
People came to pray
It was a time of hope, a time of peace
A time for a change
But in a moment all was raised to the ground
Could it ever be the same?
Some mother's son or daughter lay in wait
And blew some mother's child away
And every dream we dream
We have to pay the price
In God's name what have we become?
On Remembrance Day
On Remembrance Day
Through the hell a father dug with his bare hands
Still standing firm in his belief
He asked forgiveness for the one who'd taken life
I'm sure I heard the heavens cry
And as the grey reality of violence leaves its scar
The pictures tell their stories more than words
A sense of survival might teach us all we know
But there's another way for voices to be heard
Some mother's son or daughter lay in wait
And blew some mother's child away
And every dream we dream
We have to pay the price
In God's name what have we become?
On Remembrance Day
On Remembrance Day
I pray they find a peace
In a great and proud land
Where their sons and daughters
Will walk hand in hand
And all the hearts will beat
To the sound of one drum
When the streets no more
Echo the gunEmbed
