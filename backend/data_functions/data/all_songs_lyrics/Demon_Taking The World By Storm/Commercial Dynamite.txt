Commercial Dynamite LyricsJust to compete was once the prize
Now mega bucks are in their eyes
We light the torch then stand our ground
Money makes the world go round
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
What price your chariots of fire
Where's your spirit and burning desire?
My God is that what you earn?
Bionic Kid I guess I'm too old to learn
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Now in my day all men were men
And stereoids were something not invented then
With pride and honour, true grit and sweat
You could put down your money and place your bet
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
You wanna play with the big boys son?
I can manage your account
So go have some fun
Jump when I tell you
Win when I say
And we can have a hell of a big pay day
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Now in my day all men were men
And steroids were something not invented then
With pride and honour, true grit and sweat
You could put down your money and place your bet
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
Commercial dynamite
You wanna play with the big boys son?
I can manage your account
So go have some fun
Jump when I tell you
Win when I say
And we can have a hell of a big pay day
