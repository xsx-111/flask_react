Taking The World By Storm LyricsDon't run something's happening
On the streets tonight
This fight it's not over but we've seen the light
The roar of the jungle
The gleam of a switchblade
Victims in the night
We hold the balance
The key to the city
The scales of wrong and right
We made our name on the streets of America
Standing for liberty
Angels of destiny
This time we're taking the world by storm
It's time the battle's won
This time we're taking the world by storm
It's time the battle's won
In the heat, shots rings out the heart beats wild
In the dark there's a cry for help
On the downtown side
We served our time in the badlands of Paradise
The strip joints and the bars
It's tough on the beat but
We're here to protect you
The people's National Guard
We made our name on the streets of America
Standing for liberty
Angels of destiny
This time we're taking the world by storm
It's time the battle's won
This time we're taking the world by storm
It's time the battle's won
-Solo-
One day we'll take our place in the hall of fame
And like the West we'll leave our mark
When we rule the plain
The roar of the jungle
The gleam of a switchblade
Victims in the night
We hold the balance
The key to the city
The scales of wrong and right
We made our name on the streets of America
Standing for liberty
Angels of destiny
This time we're taking the world by storm
It's time the battle's won
This time we're taking the world by storm
It's time the battle's won
This time we're taking the world by storm
It's time the battle's won
This time we're taking the world by storm
It's time the battle's wonEmbed
