Time Has Come LyricsJust a pair of dreamers
You and me against the world
Writing all those magic lines
No one ever heard
Riding all the storms together
Reaching out to see
Dreaming of a new tomorrow
Didn't we?
Two kids from the back street
We were searching for the rainbow's end
Riding on the wheels of fortune
You and me my friend
Taking all the highs and lows
With a spirit that could tear down walls
We learned to run
To be free
We gave it all
Oh, now the race is run
Gotta to take it on for you
See the journey through
Tonight, out there I hear the call
I know that my time has come
We sail against the odds
And all the world will know
Feel the warmth of the sun that shines in my eyes
Take away the mask
The time has come
Painting all life's pictures
Well you know at least we tried
And though the years have left their mark
We're still the same inside
Forever in those empty rooms
Still the dream lives on
And someone else will sing our song
When we're gone
I guess we never sold out
So we were never really in
I wouldn't change the way it was
Or the places I have been
Just to have the chance to say
All the things I never said before
We learned to grow
To be free
We did it all
Oh, you took me by surprise
Gotta take it on for you
See the journey through
Tonight, out there I hear the call
I know that my time has come
We sail against the odds
And all the world will know
Feel the warmth of the sun that shines in my eyes
Take away the mask
Our time has come
Tonight, out there I hear the call
I know that my time has come
We sail against the odds
And all the world will know
Feel the warmth of the sun that shines in my eyes
Take away the mask
The time has come
Tonight, Somewhere I'll hear the call
I know that my time has come
We sail against the odds
And all the world will know
Feel the warmth of the sun that shines in my eyes
Take away the mask
The time has come
Tonight, Somewhere I'll hear the call
I know that my time has come
We sail against the odds
And all the world will know
Feel the warmth of the sun that shines in my eyes
Take away the mask
The time has comeEmbed
