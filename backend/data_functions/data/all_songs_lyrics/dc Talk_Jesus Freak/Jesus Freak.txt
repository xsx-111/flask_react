Jesus Freak Lyrics
What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus freak? (It's the…)
What will people do (…freakshow) when they find that it's true?
Ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho-oh
Ho, ho

Separated, I cut myself clean
From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams
Been apprehended by a spiritual force
And a grace that replaced all the me I've divorced

I saw a man with tat on his big fat belly
It wiggled around like marmalade jelly
It took me a while to catch what it said
'Cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly wit' my head
"Jesus Saves" is what it raved in a typical tattoo green
He stood on a box in the middle of the city and he claimed he had a dream

What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus freak?
What will people do when they find that it's true? (Ho, ho)
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguisin' the truth (Ho, ho, ho-oh)
There ain't no disguisin' the truth
No, I ain't into hidin' the truth

Kamikaze, my death is gain
I've been marked by my Maker a peculiar display, yeah (Peculiar display)
The high and lofty, they see me as weak
'Cause I won't live and die for the power they seek, yeah

There was a man from the desert with naps in his head
The sand that he walked was also his bed
The words that he spoke made the people assume
There wasn't too much left in the upper room
With skins on his back and hair on his face
They thought he was strange by the locusts he ate
Ya see, the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak
Until the king took the head o' this Jesus freak

What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus freak?
What will people do when they find that it's true? (Ho, ho)
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguisin' the truth (Ho, ho, ho-oh)
What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus freak?
What will people do when they find that it's true? (Ho, ho)
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguisin' the truth (Ho, ho, ho-oh)
No, I ain't into hidin'

People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger
That my best friend was born in a manger?
People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger
That my best friend was born in a manger?


What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus freak?
What will people do when they find that it's true? (Ho, ho)
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguisin' the truth (Ho, ho, ho-oh)
What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus freak?
What will people do when they find that it's true? (Ho, ho)
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguisin' the truth (Ho, ho, ho-oh)

What will people think?
What will people think? (Ho, ho, ho-oh)
What will people do?
What will people do? (Ho, ho-oh)
I don't really care
What else can I say? (Ho, ho, ho-oh)
There ain't no disguisin' the truth
Jesus is the way (Ho, ho, ho-oh)2Embed
