Jesus Freak (Reprise) LyricsWhat would people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus Freak?
And what will people do when they find that it's true?
What would people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus Freak?
What would people do when they find that it's true?
Hallelujah
Thank you
How many came from Shelby County today?
Hallelujah, I see that hand, hallelujah
Glory
Thank you, thank you very much
Just sway your hands to the music1Embed
