Like It, Love It, Need It Lyrics
Under these circumstances, they can hardly cope
Notice their fleeting glances and their lack of hope
I offer this suggestion, they don't seem to care-o
This is my generation, drowning in despair-o

You'll never find peace of mind in your pool of self
You'll never find peace of mind in a sea of wealth
You'll never find peace of mind in your rock and roll
You'll never find peace of mind if you sell your soul

You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some freedom from the strife
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some Jesus in your life
Some Jesus in your life (Oh-oh-oh)
Some Jesus in your life

We circumvent our feelings through an angry sound
He who complains the loudest wears the fattest crown
We're anti-everybody, call it paranoia
Well, I ain't no judge or jury, but I'm prayin' for ya
You'll never find peace of mind in your lucky charm
You'll never find peace of mind on a hippie farm
You'll never find peace of mind in a one-night stand
You'll never find peace of mind in your Superman

You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some freedom from the strife (I know you need it)
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some Jesus in your life (I know you need it)

You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need it
You gotta like it, you gotta love it (Oh-oh-oh)
I know you need some Jesus in your life

Like it!
Love it!
Need it!
Yo, believe it! (Oh)
Like it! (Don't you like it?)
Love it!
Need it! (Don't you need it?)
Yo, believe it! (Like!)
Oh, you stepped right in the middle of a freak attack (Like it!)
'Cause we're back and we're comin' like that (Love it!)
You see, we're lowerin' the boom in the middle of the tune (Need it!)
'Cause the funk is always heavy where it's at (Yo, believe it!)
And while you're whinin' all the time, never changin' any minds (Like it!)
It is clear to see your lip has lost its button (Love it!)
'Cause if you take a think at this, then it's easy to admit (Need it!)
That the selfish way you're livin' is for nothin' (Yo, believe it!)
You gotta like it
You know you need some freedom from the strife
You gotta love it
I know you need some Jesus in your life

You gotta like it, you gotta love it (Oh)
I know you need some freedom from the strife
You gotta like it (You gotta like it), you gotta love it (You gotta love it)
I know you need some Jesus in your life

You gotta like it (You gotta like it), you gotta love it (You gotta love it) (Oh-oh-oh)
I know you need it
You gotta like it (You gotta like it), you gotta love it (You gotta love it) (Oh-oh-oh)
I know yaâ€”
God knows you need it

You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need it
Some Jesus in your life
Jesus in your lifeEmbed
