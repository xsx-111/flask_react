So Help Me God Lyrics
I got somethin' for you, man
Ba
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba (Yeah)
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba (Alright)

Bombarded by philosophies that satisfy the surface (Surface)
I flee to somethin' deeper at the risk of seeking purpose (Purpose)
How can I hang in this environmental state of being (Being)
When everything I'm strivin' for is nothin' that I'm seein'? (Seein')

Won't You take my heart? Won't You take my soul?
Won't You come and make me whole again?
You, You got what I need, and You never retreat
Unto You I will concede

So help me, God (So help me, God)
To put my faith in You
So help me, God (So help me, God)
Before I come unglued
Call it my addiction
I can't get enough of You
So help me, God (So help me, God)
To put my faith in You
Infected by the skin I'm in that's starvin' with desire (Desire)
And Jesus ain't the latest thing to come across the wire (Wire)
I throw myself at mercy for I am the chief of sinners (Sinners)
But daily takin' up my cross has brought its share of splinters (Splinters)

You're there when I call, and You're there when I fall
Even though I don't deserve it all
You, You light my way through the night and the day
And from You I will not stray

So help me, God (So help me, God)
To put my faith in You
So help me, God (So help me, God)
Before I come unglued
Call it my addiction
I can't get enough of You
So help me, God (So help me, God)
To put my faith in You, yeah


Won't You take my heart? Won't You take my soul? (Won't You take my heart?)
Won't You come and make me whole again?
You, You got what I need, and You never retreat (You got what I need)
Unto You I will concede
So help me, God (So help me, God)
To put my faith in You
So help me, God (So help me, God)
Before I come unglued
Call it my addiction
I can't get enough of You
So help me, God (So help me, God)
To put my faith in You

God, so help me
So help me, God
This is my soul plea (Ooh)
I'm desperately devoted
I can't get enough of You
So help me, God

'Cause You are the one I love (You are the one I love)
Yes, I know You are
'Cause You are the one I need (You are the one I need)
I need You
You are the one I'm seekin' (You are the one I'm seekin')
Every single day
'Cause You are the one for me (You are the one for me, uh)
Rum pum pum pum
Ba
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba (You are the one I love)
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba (You are the one I need)
Ba
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba (You are the one I'm seekin')
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba ba-ba-ba (You are the one for me, me, me, me)

I just walked into a meat and three
And everybody's starin' at me
I gotta go1Embed
