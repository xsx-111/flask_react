Day by Day Lyrics
Duh duh-duh-duh-duh
Yea, he knows the way home
Duh duh-duh-duh-duh
He knows the way

I live a simple life, I take a day at a time
I spend my mornings with God before I hit the grind
The subtleties o' darkness never cease to amaze
As a physical world creates a spiritual haze

Blinded by distractions
Lost in matter-less affairs
Reachin' through the darkness
Trustin' You will meet me there

Day by day (Day by day)
Day by day (Day by day)
Oh, dear Lord, three things I pray (One, two, three)
To see Thee more clearly (Day by day)
To love Thee more dearly (Day by day)
To follow Thee more nearly (I got to take it…)
Day by day
Duh duh-duh-duh-duh
He knows the way home
Duh duh-duh-duh-duh
You cruise around the corner
He knows the way
You watch your back

You sweep your feet down alley streets
Sometimes you creep, I never see you comin'
Monday, man, you're on my back
Like a knapsack strapped with my heavy burden, no

You cannot condemn me
I won't buy your bag of goods
You got nothin' for me
Anyway, that's why I pray (Come on)

Day by day (Day by day)
Day by day (Day by day)
Oh, dear Lord, three things I pray (One, two, three)
To see Thee more clearly (Day by day)
To love Thee more dearly (Day by day)
To follow Thee more nearly (We got to take it…)
Day by day
These three things
I do pray
Day by day

Day by day by day by day (These three things)
Day by day by day by day (I do pray)
Day by day by day by day by day (Day by day, day by day, day by day)
Day by day by day by day (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Day by day by day by day (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Day by day by day by day by day (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's one step at a time!

Day by day (Day by day)
Day by day (Day by day)
Oh, dear Lord, three things I pray (One, two, three)
To see Thee more clearly (Day by day)
To love Thee more dearly (Day by day)
To follow Thee more nearly (We got to take it…)
Day by day

As you walk (Monday!)
Day by day
Day by day (Tuesday!)
Day by day
Go to God and pray (Wednesday!)
Day by day
"I'm gonna go Your way" (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, yo!)
Day by day
You know you gotta pray
See Thee more clearly
Every day
Love Thee more dearly
Ooh, oh yeah
Follow Thee more nearly
I'm gonna go your way
Does anybody hear me?
Day by day by day by day (Come on!)
Day by day by day by day (Come on!)
Day by day by day by day by day
That is what I'm sayin', yo! (One day at a time)Embed
