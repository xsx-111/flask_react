You Can Bring Me Flowers LyricsMy eyes have dried, my hands are tied
Nothing I can say
If you feel the need to go
I won't stand in your way
Sit and think, drown in drink
Sing this sad, sad song
But you can bring me flowers, baby
When I'm dead and gone
Fate has played his hand so cruel
There ain't nothing I can do
You say you lost your love for me
Me, my love for you
Sit and cry and say goodbye
And sing this sad, sad song
You can bring me flowers, baby
When I'm dead and gone
So when you're lying in his arms
Think of me and know
The choice you made it free and clear
Costs me a heavy toll
Sit and think, drown in drink
And sing this sad, sad song
You can bring me flowers, baby
When I'm dead and goneEmbed
