Three More Days LyricsThree more days
Girl, you know I will be coming home to you, darling
Three more days
Girl, you know I will be coming home to you, darling
I know it's wrong to be so far from home
I know it's wrong to leave you so alone
I've just got to getcha this good job done
So I can bring it on home to you
So I can bring it on home to you
Three more days
Girl, you know I will be right there by your side, baby
Three more days
Girl, you know I will be right there by your side, baby
I know it's wrong to leave you so alone
I know it's wrong to be so far from home
I've just got to getcha this good job done
So I can bring it on home to you
So I can bring it on home to you
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
Home to youm home to you
I said listen up, listen up

Home to you, home to you
I said listen up, listen up, listen up
