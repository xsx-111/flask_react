Gone Away From Me LyricsFor a while, I sat there staring at her photograph
For a while, I cried and tried not to make a scene
There was a time when we were young, I used to make her laugh
But life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Lately, I can't seem to find myself no sleep at all
Lately, I just lie awake and hear and dream
Of the time when she was mine, felt like I had it all
But life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Yesterday is gone
Yesterday is dead
Get it through your head and walk away
Yesterday is gone
Ain't no use hanging on
To her memory, it only causes you pain
For a while, I sat there staring at her photograph
For a while, I cried and tried not to make a scene
There was a time when we were young, I used to make her laugh
But life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from meEmbed
