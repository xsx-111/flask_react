Barfly LyricsBarfly
Just a barfly baby, uh-huh
Barfly
Just a barfly baby, uh-huh
Kiss me before you go
I'm going nowhere lately
Barfly
Just a barfly baby, uh-huh
Barfly
Just a barfly baby, uh-huh
Slow down
Slow down, you move too fast
Slow down
Slow down, you move too fast
Kiss me before you go
I'm going nowhere lately
Kiss me before you go
I'm going nowhere lately
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhereEmbed
