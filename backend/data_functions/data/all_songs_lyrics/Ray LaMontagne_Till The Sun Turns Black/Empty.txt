Empty Lyrics
She lifts her skirt up to her knees
Walks through the garden rows with her bare feet, laughin'
I never learned to count my blessings
I choose instead to dwell in my disasters
I walk on down the hill
Through grass, grown tall and brown
And still it's hard, somehow, to let go of my pain
On past the busted back of that
Old and rusted Cadillac
That sinks into this field, collecting rain

Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged

And of these cutthroat busted sunsets
These cold and damp white mornings, I have grown weary
If through my cracked and dusty dime-store lips
I spoke these words out loud, would no one hear me?
Lay your blouse across the chair
Let fall the flowers from your hair
And kiss me with that country mouth, so plain
Outside, the rain is tapping on the leaves
To me, it sounds like they're applauding us
The quiet love we've made
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged

Well, I looked my demons in the eyes
Laid bare my chest, said, "Do your best, destroy me
See, I been to hell and back so many times
I must admit, you kinda bore me"
There's a lotta things that can kill a man
There's a lotta ways to die
Yes, and some already did and walk beside me
There's a lotta things I don't understand
Why so many people lie
It's the hurt I hide that fuels the fire inside me

Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged
