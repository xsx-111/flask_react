Till the Sun Turns Black LyricsCan you see the young and pretty
Confident as cops
Blooming, laughing in the shops
Till the sun turns black
Can you see the old and lonely
Walking through the park
Pushing grocery carts
Till the sun turns black
Can you see the corporate man
He's winning on the telephone
His possessions are his throne
Till the sun turns black
Can you see him in his lounger
Watching tv in the dark
Waiting for the spark
Till the sun turns black
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh we, oh whoa, oh whoa whoa
Ooh, oh we, who are we?
Can you see the working classes
Trudging through their days
Time goes slowly when you're only waiting
Till the sun turns black
Can you see the wise man simply
Living loving quietly
Every breath he takes eternity
Till the sun turns blackEmbed
