Caress Lyrics(Anton Newcombe)
I know the difference between right and wrong
I pool them all together and I made this song
I know the difference between night and the day
Doesn't really matter what I think or say
I know the difference between black and white
Doesn't really matter what you say is right
I know the difference white and gray
Doesn't really matter what you think I say
I know the difference between the right and the wrong
I put them all together and I made a song
But I know the meaning of rock'n'roll
I'll tell you all about it 'cause it's in my soul
I'll teach you all about it 'cause it's in my soulEmbed
