(David Bowie I Love You) Since I Was Six LyricsDoes she love you, you suppose
With somebody who would know
Who believes in what you are
You're my favorite thing by far
There's a fire in your eyes
I see it all sometimes
In the darkness of the night
I see it many times
Yes I'm sure it shines in you
There's no place left to go
When I'm feeling kind of slow (slow down, sir)
Do you like the way you are
Yes it is, 'cause you're the star
It's the brightness in your eyes
I see it all tonight
In the darkness of my light
Shining on the chosen few2Embed
