Take It from the Man Lyrics(Anton Newcombe)
It's just like I said
They're fucking with your head
You ain't safe in your bed
Or even when your dead
They're out to school you
So they can rule you
They try to fool you
Or just get to you
And i seen it coming down
So i headed out of town
Because i'm quick like that
I seen them on tv
They even look like me
They said they'll set me free
But that can't ever be
All i know is it's coming down
So i'm headed out of town
Because i'm quick like that
Always bounce right back
Stupid magazines
Sell you useless things
Silly as it seems
They even steal your dreams
And i know it's coming down
So i'm headed out of town
Cause i'm quick like that
Never coming back
Man i know it's coming down
So i'm heading far from town
Cause i'm smart like that
Never coming back
CAuse I'm quick like thatEmbed
