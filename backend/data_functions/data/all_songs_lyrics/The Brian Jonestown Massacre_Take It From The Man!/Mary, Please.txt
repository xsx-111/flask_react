Mary, Please LyricsI know it seems insane
I'll never feel ashamed of you
I’m tired of silly games
I cannot waste away the truth
I lay in bed all the day
There’s nothing more to say to you
If I look for change
I know it takes a day or two
Away from you
Sadly I remain in love with you
All my tears and fears I gained from you
I will not waste away
For even have a day or two
And if you run away
There's no looking after you
And that's the truth
Sadly I remain in love with you
I’ll do anything you ask to do
Stay trueEmbed
