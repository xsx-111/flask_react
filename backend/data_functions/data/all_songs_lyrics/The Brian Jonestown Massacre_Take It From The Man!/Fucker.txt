Fucker LyricsI've been waiting in my room so long
I think about the ways you've done me wrong
Again
Fucking bitch you tried to drag me down
Talk about me all around the town
Non end
No end
Oh
Once you half start
With your daggars sharp inside your heart
If you fuck me i will fall apart
There's no end
Fucking people try to bring me down
Talk about me and your stupid town
Oh
Once we half start
Oh
Once we half start
Oh
