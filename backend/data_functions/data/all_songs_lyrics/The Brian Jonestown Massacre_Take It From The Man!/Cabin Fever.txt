Cabin Fever LyricsI wonder why I bother getting out of bed
I've got this point of view I borrowed from a friend
He knows how hard it is to make up your own mind
So if he wants to do it for me that's just fine
It's easy when you realize you're nothing, you're nothing
It's easy when you realize
I wonder why I bother going out at all
I have this room that's got no windows only walls
It gets so dark inside I lose track of the time
So if I sleep and die don't wake me I don't mind
It's easy when you realize you're nothing, you're nothing
It's easy when you realize
Trying to sleep but I always wake up
Haven't seen you for weeks maybe we should break up
Please don't ask why, baby don't ask why
Please don't ask why, I think it's time we say goodbye, oh...
Lying here on the floor I can't stand up to it
Got to dream anymore these monsters haunting my sleep
Put a lock on the door to try and keep them outside
But their in my head I don't know where I can hide
So I'm talking to them 'cause I lost all my friends
I can forget what I want so I'll get drunk again
I don't wanna feel anymore 'cause I only feel pain
Put my thoughts in the sink and watch them go down the drain
Lie down to sleep but I might stop breathing
My heart beats so weak I'm so scared of leaving
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, too fucking young to say goodbyeEmbed
