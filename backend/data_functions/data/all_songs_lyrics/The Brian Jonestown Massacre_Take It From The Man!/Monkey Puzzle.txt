Monkey Puzzle LyricsSomebody help me, help me get that girl cause
I know that I need her, I know that I need her
There's nobody sweeter in the whole wide world
I'm dying to meet her, I'm dying to meet her
'Cause when I see her and she looks so fine
I can't give up till I know she's mine, yeah
Oh Lord, can you help me, could you tell me her name, 'cause
I know that I need her, I know that I need her
I'm somebody tryin', tryin' to play the game, 'cause
I know that I need her, I'm dyin' to greet her
I think about almost her every night
To live without her well it wouldn't be right
When I see her, yeah she looks so fine
I can't give up till I know she's mine, yeahEmbed
