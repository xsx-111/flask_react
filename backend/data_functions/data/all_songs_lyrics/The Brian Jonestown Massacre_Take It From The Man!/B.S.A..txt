B.S.A. Lyrics(Matt Hollywood)
Gonna buy a motorcycle
So i can chase her down the street
I never seen nothing like her
She nearly knocked me off my feet
It's going to be a long cold winter
But i feel so warm
When i'm in her
When i'm in her arms
She goes off like a shot-gun
She's got me begging on my knees
Like a kiss from jesus
Made me forget my disease
(Matt Hollywood, Anton Newcombe)
It's going to be a long cold winter
But i feel so warm
When i'm in her
When i'm in her arms
I'm going to steal a motorcycle
So i can chase her down the street
Never seen nothing like her
She nearly knocked me off my feet
It's going to be a long cold winter
But i feel so warm
When i'm in her
When i'm in her arms
Got a feeling
I'm going in deep
Through your skinny arms around me
Until i can't breath
And stop running away
Stop running away from me
Stop running away
Stop running away from me!
Stop running away
Stop running away from me!
Ah-ha-ah-ha-ha-ha-ah-haEmbed
