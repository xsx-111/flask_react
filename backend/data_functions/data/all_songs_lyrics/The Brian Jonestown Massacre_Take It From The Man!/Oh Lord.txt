Oh Lord Lyrics(Matt Hollywood)
Oh lord you know it ain't right
To live my life this way
I gotta stay up every night and feed this feeling
Till it goes away
Y'know I had my crime
And I paid my due
I've seen the best of times, I've had the best of friends
I bet it all to lose
(Matt Hollywood/Anton Newcombe)
And now I've seen the light
I'm gonna show it to you
You gotta lay right down, you gotta close your eyes
And let it flow right through you
'Cause I
I believe it in my soul
And I always want feel this way
So honey let the good times roll
Party all night long
I've been sitting here drinking
How come it took so long for me to change my mind
Don't know what I was thinking
But now I've seen the light
I want to give it to you
You gotta lay right down, you gotta close your eyes
You gotta let me in you
'Cause I
I believe it's in my soul
And I always want feel this way
So honey let the good times roll
You gotta let me in youEmbed
