Vacuum Boots Lyrics1.2.3.4*
You're beautiful
Girl i wish that
You could see
So stay the same
As you have
Always been
Cause you're wonderful
You live in a lie
Cause it makes you happy
Do what you like
If you want
You can ask me....
What i know
Is i never knew
Nothing
So i know that
I need to learn
Where to go?
Oh woe, woe, woe, woe
Floating, flying
Hoping you could see
An awful thing
That you wish that
You was me
Cause you're wonderful
Laugh all your life if it makes you happy
You do what you like
If you want you can ask me...
What i know
Is
I never knew nothing
So i know that
I need to learn
Where to go?
Woe, woe, woe, woe, woeEmbed
