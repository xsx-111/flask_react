Who? LyricsWho? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who?
I see yellow, I see orange, I see green, icy blue
I see every color that has ever been inside of you
If it's boring, just ignore me, don't tell me who are you?
Who? Who? Who? Who?
If I wake up or we break up, no make up, who are you?
When we're fighting it's exciting what to do
If you give up before it's time you are through
Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who?Embed
