Straight Up and Down LyricsI tried to see
Well I guess that I'm blind
It's fine with me
Cause I'm going to keep on trying, yeah
Cause I've made disappointment my very best friend
I wait to see
Who you're going to be
And when yeah
We don't want you be yourself you see
We want you to free yourself
It does no good to pretend
That you are free
If you can not see you
I love you but
It drags me down
I never felt like
I feel when I'm frying
I don't care where
I'm living
Or I'm dying
We just want you to see yourself
You see
We want you to free yourself
It does no good to pretend what you could be
Why don't you be you
I love you but
You drag me down
Cause I know it so well
How I never could tell
Who's my very best friend?
How I know you so well
I could make you be me1Embed
