Monster LyricsWhen i looked in your eyes
And i saw my own face
How it seemed out of place
Like mans foot steps in space
But were already there
Then i felt your breath
See my life in your eyes
And a fate worse than death
As i drew my next breath
Did you think i'd survive
Uncommon expectations do arise
I make peace with your monsters
And their lies
Then i touched your lips
And we started to kiss
Having spent my whole life
Until this moment arrived
I knew nothing like this
And i looked in your eyes
I saw my own face
How it seemed out of place
Like mans foot steps in space
But we're already there
I'm not going to fake this every time
I make peace with the monsters
Cause they're mineEmbed
