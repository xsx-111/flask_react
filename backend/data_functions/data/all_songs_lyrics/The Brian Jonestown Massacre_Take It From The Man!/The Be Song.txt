The Be Song LyricsYou tried to break my heart in two
But thats okay, thats what you do
You take the best i gave to you
You take so long, what's going on here?
I hate to wait, I wait for you
You take so long, have I been wrong here?
It's not the things you say or do
But still I'm wrong. Do I belong and
It's the strange way, you're cruel
You don't belong, am I wrong here?
(Oh yeah)Embed
