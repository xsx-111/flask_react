My Man Syd LyricsOh
You're gonna play at my house
You're going to share
'Cause it's getting very cold out
Although you don't care about you
I know it's unfair to doubt you
Liar
In the wicked game that you play
The rules are unfair
It's not the thing that you say
You're friends all swear they doubt you
They don't really care about youEmbed
