Dreamsicle Lyrics
I guess we’re leaving town again
We’re moving out and moving in
Gotta break the news to all my friends
But they won't care
They'll just find another face
To fall behind, to take my place
To run way out past second base
And just stand there

A dreamsicle on a summer night
In a folding lawn chair
Witch's ring around the moon
Better get home soon

Poison oak to poison ivy
Dirty jokes that blew right by me
Mama curling up beside me
Crying to herself
Why can't Daddy just come home?
Forget whatever he did wrong
He's in a hotel all alone
And we need help
A dreamsicle on a summer night
In a folding lawn chair
I'm still packing up my room
Gotta get home soon
New sneakers on a high school court
And you swore you'd be there
My heart breaking through the springtime
Breaking in June

Broken glass and broken vows
I'll be 18 four years from now
With different friends in a different town
I'll finally be free
Call you both some holiday
Tell you why I moved away
Say, "Everything’s gonna be okay
You can come see me"

A dreamsicle on a summer night
In a folding lawn chair
Daddy's howling at the moon
Better get home soon
Heat lightning in the evening sky
And my mama's red hair
Hearts breaking through the springtime
Breaking in June
Breaking in June
Breaking in JuneEmbed
