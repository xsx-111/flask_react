It Gets Easier Lyrics
Last night I dreamed that I'd been drinking
Same dream I have 'bout twice a week
I had one glass of wine
I woke up feeling fine
And that's how I knew it was a dream
Last night I dreamed that I'd been drinking
Cold burn of whiskey down my throat
My hand turned into a rattlesnake
And I laughed myself awake
And that's how I knew it was a joke

It gets easier but it never gets easy
I can say it's all worth it, but you won't believe me
Hold down your liquor or swallow your pride
You'd rather keep it inside
It gets easier but it never gets easy

Last night I did myself a favor
I called in sick and went downtown
Drove past the local bar
A cop got behind my car
I wish he would pull me over now
Last night I let myself remember
Times I forgot a woman's name
I blacked out behind the wheel
How tight the handcuffs feel
My daughter's eyes when she's ashamed

It gets easier, but it never gets easy
I can say it's all worth it, but you won't believe me
You can't expect her to follow your lead
She's fine with her wine and her weed
It gets easier but it never gets easy
It never gets easy
It gets easier but it never gets easy
I can say it's all worth it but you won't believe me
Hold down your liquor or swallow your pride
You'd rather keep it inside
It gets easier but it never gets easy
It never gets easy
It never gets easyEmbed
