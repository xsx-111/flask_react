Letting You Go Lyrics
The nurse helped us buckle the seat in the car
And they sent us on our way, I drove home so slow
We had no instructions, the first days were hard
But there's things about babies a woman just knows
Three in the morning I lay my hand over
Your heart just to know you were safe in your sleep
When you started walking I fight back the urge
To stay right there beside you, keep you on your feet

Being your daddy comes natural
The roses just know how to grow
It's easy to see that you'll get where you're going
The hard part is letting you go
The hard part is letting you go

It didn't take long to see you got the best of me
And your mama's merciful heart in your eyes
And helping her raise you has taught me to see through
The great fog of loneliness, the devil's disguise

Being your daddy comes natural
The roses just know how to grow
It's easy to see that you'll get where you're going
But the hard part is letting you go
The hard part is letting you go
And now you've decided to be someone's wife
And we'll walk down the aisle and I'll give you away
I wish I could walk with him back through your life
To see every last minute of every last day
To hear your first words and to feel your first heartbreak
To sing you to sleep when you're scared of the dark
The best I can do is to let myself trust that you know
Who'll be strong enough to carry your heart

And being your daddy comes natural
The roses just know how to grow
It's easy to see that you'll get where you're going
The hard part is letting you go
The hard part is letting you goEmbed
