River Lyrics
The river is my savior
'Cause she used to be a cloud
She's happy just to lay there
When she used to be so proud
And even when she dries up
A thousand years from now
I'll lay myself beside her
And call her name out loud

The river is my savior
The only one I'll ever need
Wash my head when I've been sinnin'
Wash my knuckles when they bleed
Protect me from my neighbor
All his jealousy and greed
Take the body to the delta
Hide the weapon in the weeds

But now I'm tired and a little bit confused
Regarding what I meant to do and what I did
The men I've hired, they all seem to be afraid of me
They turn their eyes away from me like kids
The river hears my secrets
Things I cannot tell a soul
Like the children that I've orphaned
And the fortune that I stole
The neighbor who asked questions
Till he washed up on the shoal
But I've done the law some favors
So nobody has to know

Now I'm tired and I just can't get to sleep
I've been a wolf among these sheep for all my life
The lake of fire it consumes me in my dreams
And last night I woke up screaming at my wife

The river is my savior
She's running to the sea
And to reach her destination
Is to simply cease to be
And running till you're nothing
Sounds a lot like being free
So I'll lay myself inside her
And I'll let her carry meEmbed
