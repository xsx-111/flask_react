Running with Our Eyes Closed Lyrics
Took forever to get you to trust me
Like I was feeding a bird from my hand
And if this isn't love, then it must be
Another answer I don't understand
To a prayer that was "please" and not "thank you"
To a question I wrote in the sand
To a wish that I made on a satellite
From a witness in tears on the stand

Running with our eyes closed
Running with our eyes closed

Well, you are who you are when you're angry
When you're scared or you're sad or you're bored
When a stranger has slipped you a room key
To a hotel room you couldn't afford
And we can never go back and be strangers
All our secrets are mixed and distilled
But you've taught me to temper my anger
And you've learned it's alright to be still

Running with our eyes closed
We're running with our eyes closed
Running with our eyes closed
We're running with our eyes closed
Sleeping alone when you won't forgive me
Swallowing my pride till I nearly choke
Screaming at the phone when you don't believe me
And laughing at the joke

We're running with our eyes closed
Running with our eyes closed
Running with our eyes closed
Running with our eyes closedEmbed
