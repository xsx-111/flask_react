Carol Lyrics
Past where the river bends
Past where the silo stands
Past where they paint the houses
Past where the river bends
Past where the silo stands
Past where they paint the houses...
PAST WHERE THEY PAINT THE HOUSES!

Past where the silo stands
Past where they paint the houses
Past where the river bends
Past where the silo stands
Past where they paint the houses
PAST WHERE THEY PAINT THE HOUSES!
PAST WHERE THEY PAINT THE HOUSES!
PAST WHERE THEY PAINT THE HOUSES!

Take away, itâ€™s something that you know
The reason, that you're always there
Use it, 'til you're through
But remember, when the time comes
You got to let go
Past where the river bends
Past where the silo stands
Past where they paint the houses
Past where the river bends
Past where the silo stands
Past where they paint the houses
PAST WHERE THEY PAINT THE HOUSES!
PAST WHERE THEY PAINT THE HOUSES!Embed
