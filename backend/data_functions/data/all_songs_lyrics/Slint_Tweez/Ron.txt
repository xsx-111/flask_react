Ron Lyrics
"Oh, um, alright. Steve, these headphones are fucked up. It's only coming of one side, like, err... Should I just bear with it, or what? Shit. They're fucked. Man, no, wait! Please give me some new headphones."

He's shown you all that's going on
Up with the sun and moon, he chooses your dawn
And now he's come home to retire with a yawn
And now he knows that he's not long
Now he spends his time trying to believe
That what he did
It was founded in me
And now he comes home
Finds a book to read
He turns the pages

Hey! Oh man...1Embed
