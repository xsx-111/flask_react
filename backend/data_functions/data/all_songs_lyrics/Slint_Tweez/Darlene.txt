Darlene LyricsI knew these two people
And, um... there was a boy and a girl
And they liked to hang together
They were nice people
They were the kind of people
That made you feel good to be around
Anyway, the thing was that
One day, they started acting
Kinda funny, kinda weird
They started being seen exchanging tokens of affection
And it was rumored that they were engaging in...
I think you know what I'm talking about
You know what happened to them?
You know what they did?
You know what they became?
You know what happened to them?
You know what they did?
You know what they became?
We know what happened to them
We know what they did
