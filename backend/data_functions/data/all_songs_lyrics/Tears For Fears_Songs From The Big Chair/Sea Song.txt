Sea Song Lyrics
You look different every time
You come from the foam - crested brine
It's your skin shining softly in the moonlight
Partly fish, partly porpoise, partly baby sperm whale
Am I yours? Are you mine to play with?

Joking apart, when you're drunk you're terrific
When you're drunk I like you mostly late at night - you're quite alright
But I can't understand the different you in the morning
When it's time to play at being human for a while

We smile
We smile
We smile

You'll be different in the spring
I know, you're a seasonal beast
Like the starfish that drift in with the tide, with the tide
So until your blood runs to meet the next full moon
Your madness fits in nicely with my own, with my own
Your lunacy fits neatly with my own, my very own
We're not aloneEmbed
