Broken Lyrics

Between the searching and the need to work it out
I stop believing everything will be alright
Broken, we are broken

I'm walking uphill being turned around and round
Secret in motion when my feet are on the ground
Broken, we are broken

In my mind's eye
One little boy anger one little man
Funny how time fliesEmbed
