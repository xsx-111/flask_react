The Working Hour Lyrics
These things that I've been told
Can rearrange
My world, my doubt
In time, but inside out

This is the working hour
We are paid by those who learn by our mistakes
This is the working hour
We are paid by those who learn by our mistakes

This day and age for all
And not for one
All lies and secrets
Put on, put on and on

This is the working hour
We are paid by those who learn by our mistakes
This is the working hour
We are paid by those who learn by our mistakes

Fear is such a vicious thing
It wraps me up in chains
Find out, find out
What this fear is about
Find out, find out
What this fear is about

Find out, find out
What this fear is about4Embed
