Broken Revisited Lyrics
Funny how time flies
One little boy anger one little man
In my mind's eye
Broken, we are broken
Secret in motion when my feet are on the ground
I'm walking uphill being turned around and round
Broken, we are broken
I stop believing everything will be alright
Between the searching and the need to work it out

Patty cake, patty cake, patty cake
Patty cake, patty-p-p-p-woo


Between the searching and the need to work it out
I stop believing everything will be alright
Broken, we are broken

I'm walking uphill being turned around and round
Secret in motion when my feet are on the ground
Broken, we are broken
In my mind's eye
One little boy anger one little man
Patty cake, patty cake, patty cake, patty cake
Funny how time flies
Patty-p-p-p-wooEmbed
