When in Love with a Blind Man Lyrics
When in love with a blind man
You watch what you say and you watch yourself burn
With dreams of escaping
Make love to the man that shapes your behaviour


When in love with a blind man
You love on your own to an occasional smile
You never know why but sometimes he smiles
And sometimes just lies there, so jealousEmbed
