Empire Building Lyrics
"It was a conspiracy, it was a consultation"


"Everything is wonderful down in South Africa"


"Lorraine has sinus after all"


"Buried alive, oh-"
"Buried alive, oh-"


"Oh freeze, oh freeze"

"We like to pass it on"
"We like to pass it on"
"We like to pass it on"


"Why don't you let me kill you harder?"


"The big house of Empire Building"Embed
