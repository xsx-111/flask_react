The Seeker Lyrics
I looked under chairs
I looked under tables
I'm tryin to find the key
To fifty million fables

They call me the seeker
I been searchin' low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked The Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me either

They call me the seeker
I been searchin' low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

People tend to hate me 'cause I never smile
As I ransack their homes, they want to shake my hand
Focusing on nowhere, investigating miles
I'm a seeker, I'm a really desperate man

I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah, but look at my face; ain't this a smile?
I'm happy when life's good, and when it's bad, I cry
I got values, but I don't know how or why

I'm looking for me
You're looking for you
We're looking at each other
And we don't know what to do

They call me the seeker
I been searchin' low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die3Embed
