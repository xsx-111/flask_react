Standing in the Doorway LyricsI can see you standing outside
See your shadow on the wall by a street lamp
I've got a manual instructing my brain
I turn around, cover eyes, I see you
Standing in the doorway;
Standing in the doorway
I can see you
Standing in the doorway;
Standing in the doorway
I can see you
I can see you walking behind
See your face silhouetted in the half light
I've got a manual instructing my brain
I turn around, cover eyes, I see you
Standing in the doorway;
Standing in the doorway
I can see you
Standing in the doorway;
Standing in the doorway
I can see you
I can feel your presence inside
Like a chill, like the point of a sharp knife
Instruction manual instructing my brain
I turn around, cover eyes, I see you
Standing in the doorway;
Standing in the doorway
I can see you
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorwayEmbed
