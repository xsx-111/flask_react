Space Age Love Song Lyrics
I saw your eyes
And you made me smile
For a little while
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes
And it touched my mind
Though it took a while
I was falling in love


I was falling in love

I saw your eyes (I saw your eyes, I saw your eyes)
And you made me cry (Made me cry, made me cry)
And for a little while (Little while, little while)
I was falling in love


I was falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love5Embed
