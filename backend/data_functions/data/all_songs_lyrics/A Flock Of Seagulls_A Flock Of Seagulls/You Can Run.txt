You Can Run LyricsWhat's this I see?
You're try'n' to hide
Away from me
Away from me
Don't you know
That you can run
But you can't hide away
No, you won't find
Your piece of mind
Away from me
Away from me
And in your mind
You will not find
Your piece of mind today
You can run, (no, you can't run)
You can hide, (no, you can't hide)
You can run, (no, you can't run)
You can hide away
You're part of me
I'm part of you
What can we do?
What can we do?
I am your sin
Living within
It's up to you
What can we do?
The more you run
The more you hide
Me down inside your head
The more they see
The you in me
The more your life is dead
You can run, (no, you can't run)
You can hide, (no, you can't hide)
You can run, (no, you can't run)
You can hide away
What's this I see?
You're try'n' to hide
Away from me
Away from me
Don't you know
That you can run
But you can't hide awayEmbed
