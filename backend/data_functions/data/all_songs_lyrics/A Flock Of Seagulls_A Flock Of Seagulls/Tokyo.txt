Tokyo LyricsIt's been a long long time
Since she’s been 'round to see me
I asked a friend of mine
What would you do if you were me
He said call her on the telephone
Said I tried but she's never home
Doesn’t seem right, doesn't seem right
She's gone to Toky, she's gone to Toky Toky Toky

(Tokyo) I thought I'd wait awhile
(Tokyo) To see if she was coming home
(Tokyo) I even asked her mom
(Tokyo) She said she didn't know
She said call her on the telephone
Said I triеd but she's never homе
Doesn't seem right, doesn’t seem right
She’s gone to Toky, she's gone to Toky Toky Toky
