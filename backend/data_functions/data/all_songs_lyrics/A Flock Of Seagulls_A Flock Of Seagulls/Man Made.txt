Man Made LyricsMan made machines make music for the man
Now machines make music while the man makes plans
A second generation, a generation lost
While the man prepares for the holocaust
Man made machines to control the days
Now machines control while the man obeys
A second generation, a generation lost
While machines prepare for the holocaustEmbed
