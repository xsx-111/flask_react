Contrast and Compare Lyrics
No, it's seven, so it's five hours before 1998. Here's a song. The last time I--

1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3

Contrast and compare
Between the busy ones and the ones who don't care
Until there is no one
That you really know
So I drift through these days
Of appointments and promises made
They'll all end up broken
And quickly replaced
Weeks are slow, days drag on
Even practice and parties seem long
But I found myself going
I guess there's nothing to do, oh well

Group of kids, line of cars
More will show up after the bars close
There's this boredom
That drowns everything
Bottles break, music plays
Conversations competing for space
I look for a corner
Or a quieter room
There's no heat (there's no heat)
In this house (in this house)
I can't breathe with these words in my mouth
But I'm not going to say them
Yeah, I've made that mistake before
On the stairs, she grabs my arm
Says, "What's up? Where you been? Is something wrong?"
I try to just smile
And say everything's fineEmbed
