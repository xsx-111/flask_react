If Winter Ends Lyrics
I dreamt of a fever
One that would cure me of this cold winter-set heart
With heat to melt these frozen tears
Burned with reasons as to carry on
Into these twisted months I plunge without a light to follow
But I swear that I would follow anything
Just get me out of here

But you get six months to adapt
And you get two more to leave town
And in the event that you do adapt
We still might not want you around

But I fell for the promise of a life with a purpose
But I know that that's impossible now
And so I drink to stay warm and to kill selected memories
'Cause I just can't think anymore about that or about her tonight

And I give myself three days to feel better
Or else I swear I'll drive right off a fucking cliff
'Cause if I can't learn to make myself feel better
How can I expect anyone else to give a shit?
And I scream for the sunlight or a car to take me anywhere
Just get me past this dead and eternal snow
'Cause I swear that I'm dying slowly, but it's happening
And if the perfect spring is waiting somewhere

Just take me there
Just take me there
Just take me there
And say and lie to me and say
And lie to me and say
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
Yeah, you worry too much, kid
It's gonna be alright5Embed
