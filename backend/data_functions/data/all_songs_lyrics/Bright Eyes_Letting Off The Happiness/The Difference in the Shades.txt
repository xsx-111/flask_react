The Difference in the Shades Lyrics
Now that it's June, we'll sleep out in the garden
And if it rains, we'll just sink into the mud
Where it is quiet and much cooler than the house is
And there's no clocks or phones to wake us up
Because I have learned that nothing is as pressing
As the one's pressing would like you to believe
And I am content to walk a little slower
Because there's nowhere that I really need to be

And I find that life is easier
When it's just a blur
With no details to
Confuse who or what or where I was
So when the ending comes
The full regret will seem obscure

But these are days we dream about
When the sunlight paints us gold
And this apartment could not be prettier
As we danced up there alone
And this TV's old, the color's fucked
You see the difference in the shades?
But the green's still close to green, my love
And I believe we are the same
And we'll stay like this, all gold and green
Light collects, it projects your heart on a movie screen
And if you close your eyes, we will always be
The way we were that night you crawled inside of me
And you slept in my blood the way you sleep now
The quietest hush has consumed this house
And when the doctors have gone and you sweat through the bed
With the pictures and pills they piled around your head

But just rest now
And in a moment you'll know everything
Was it all a dream?
It's too vague now to recount
An outline of the one you loved
In a life that was
That no longer will be
Stands above you
As you sleep1Embed
