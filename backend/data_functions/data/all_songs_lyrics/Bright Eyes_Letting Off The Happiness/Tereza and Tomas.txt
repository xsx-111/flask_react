Tereza and Tomas Lyrics
Let’s sail away past the noise of the bay
Let’s sail away past the birth and death of the day
Let’s sail away to where the blues and greens swirl into gray
Let’s sail away

Let’s sail away past the cradle of these waves
Let’s sail away past the tide and its slow decay
Let’s sail away to where the water goes, some endless open space
Let’s sail away

Take only what you need, my love
And leave the rest behind
Don’t be afraid of where we go, my love
I promise you'll be fine
Now you are the only one that's mine

Let’s sail away past the reflections of the light
Let’s sail away floating weightless through the night
Let’s sail away like a photograph, fading to all white
It’s finally all right

Forget all the mistakes, my love
They won’t be made again
Leave the photos in the drawer, my love
We no longer need them
We both know where we’ve been
Let’s sail away disappearing in a mist
Let’s sail away with a whisper and a kiss
Or vanish from a road somewhere, like Tereza and Tomas
Suspended in this blissEmbed
