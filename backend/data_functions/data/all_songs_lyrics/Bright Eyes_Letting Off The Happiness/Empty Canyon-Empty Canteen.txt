Empty Canyon/Empty Canteen Lyrics
Don't waste the water
Yeah, don't drink it now
'Cause this desert keeps growing
And we might never get out
Besides, we're not even moving
We're just standing around

But I must admit that when it comes to this
I'm as scared as the rest
Feels like something's hunted me down
It'll end up to be like the films that you've seen
Where they they bury the bones
They will never be found

But I do
But I do
But I do
But I do
But I do
But I do
But I do
But I do
But I do
I do
Ooh
But I do
