A Poetic Retelling of an Unfortunate Seduction Lyrics
The language
In the dimmer rooms
Seems to represent its light source well
How soft they speak
And seem to be at peace
With the movement of the music and the madness
That's pulling me
Into this

And the shades of the lamps are woven red
The light, it stains and consecrates
Anointing all forgotten forms
That swirl and smoke and haunt this place
The girls in gowns all nurse the dark
Pulling it near to their swelling breasts
And watch as it seeps to their hearts
And beats within their virgin chests
And here I know seduction breeds
From wanton hearts that would seduce
And grows and spreads its vines and leaves
Embracing those who might have moved
But now remain to drink the night
From vials black and thick with steam
Such intoxicating delights
Would leave you drunk inside this dream
And you watch them take the light from you
And you find yourself
On a velvet couch
Tasting the skin of a foreign girl
Her eyes are black
And wet like oil
And she ties your hands with a string of pearls
And you tremble like a frightened bird
As she closes in and captures you
To place you in a silver cage
Deep within her poisoned womb
And once you're safe inside
She might let you out
To fly
In circles
Around the room
But it's always night
And there is no moon
And you wonder if you are alive
And you're not sure if you want to be
But you drink her sweat like it was wine
And you lay with her
On a bed of blue
And it's awful sweet
Like the fruit she cuts and feeds to you
To you
To you
To you
To you1Embed
