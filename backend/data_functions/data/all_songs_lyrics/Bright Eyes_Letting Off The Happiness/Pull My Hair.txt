Pull My Hair Lyrics
Is the passion all gone?
Or is it still newly wed?
If all this heat's doing
Is making us stick to the bed
Then there's no life
To revive

But if the hunger's still there
Buried somewhere inside
Covered up by the boredom
We've been trying to hide
Dig it up
And devour

And it'll seem more like a song
And less like it's math
If you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
And it'll seem more like a song
And less like it's math
If you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
It'll seem more like a song
Yeah, more like a song
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

And the truth is that I can't hardly wait
I don't care if we stay up too late
Don't answer the phone
Don't answer the phone

And it'll seem more like a song
And less like it's math
If you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
It'll seem more like a song
And less like it's math
If you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
And bite me like that
And bite me like, scratch me like that
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

And the truth is that I can't hardly wait
And it's so bad I can't concentrate
Don't answer the phone
Don't answer the phone
'Cause it'll seem more like a song
And less like it's math
If you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
It'll seem more like a song
And less like it's math
If you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
And bite me like that
And scratch me like that
(Bite me like that)Embed
