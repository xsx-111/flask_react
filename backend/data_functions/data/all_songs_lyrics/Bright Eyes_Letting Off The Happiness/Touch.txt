Touch Lyrics
Touch, lying on the floor
Wishing this could last
But knowing that it can't
And soon you will leave
And I'll be on the floor
Watching the TV
Trying hard to find
A reason to move
I'm frozen in one place
Staring at the screen
Listening to the rain
Falling on the street

Some days go on too long
And no
No one can hang out
Tonight

Here, where the carpet's cool and soft
Underneath the clock
I feel my weary heart
Is put to rest
You gather 'round your friends
The connection that you feel
When the night has not yet died
You are new
With a promise of a love
You'll probably never find
And touch that you can really feel
The brokenness inside
As hope and less collide
Now nothing is real
(You are new and near now to someone you used to love
When you were young; when all was gold and you two touched
And felt the flutter underneath your skin. you stood in glowing rooms
The light dripping from both of you
And nothing since has felt as radiant or real)

And there is nothing more I want
Than just one night
That's free of doubt and sadness
One night
One night
One night
That I can really feelEmbed
