Pyre LyricsFollow the embers into cities of dreams
What you've been seeing is not all what it seems
Dawn of the liars
Future's a pyre
Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry
Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep
I wish this beating would flow to me with the love I keep
Look down your senses
Await the gritting beyond
And in the morning this starkness would trail alone
Born as a failure and dying as a stranger
When your country's bleeding while you're forced to mourn
Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry
Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep
I wish this beating would flow to me with the love I keep
"Bring me back again"Embed
