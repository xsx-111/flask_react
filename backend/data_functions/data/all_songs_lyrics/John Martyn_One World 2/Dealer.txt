Dealer LyricsWell I cannot be your lover
And I will not be your friend
Well, I know you say you need me
But I have no time to spend
We could talk like this for hours
I just end up getting bored
'Cause no one needs a dealer
Just the day before a score
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in
Do you think that you could leave me?
'Could you leave and go away just for a little while?
Do you think that I could leave you?
Could I leave and go away just for a change of style?
Well they tell me that they dig my shit
So I sell it to them cheap
But they bring the scales and check the deal
Are you scared that I might cheat?
Well, you're just a spit and polish
On a fat man's shiny shoe
And I think I hate them for it
And I think they hate me too
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in
Well, you spend your whole life moanin' down
A telephone for bread
You can't get to sleep for tryin'
To remember what you said
You come around most any time
And sell me what you can
What you see is what you get
Catch me if you can
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in
Do you think that you could leave me?
'Could you leave and go away just for a little while?
Do you think that I could leave you?
Would I leave and go away just for a change of style?
Well, I cannot be your lover
And I will not be your friend
Well, I know you say you need me
But I have no time to spend
We could talk like this for hours
I just end up getting bored
No one needs a dealer
Just the day before a score
Let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me inEmbed
