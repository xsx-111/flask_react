Pilgrims Lyrics
Sometimes you feel so far away
Distanced from all the action of the play
Unable to grasp significance
Marking the plot with diffident dismay
Stranded at centre stage
Scrabbling through your diary for a lost page:
Unsure of the dream

Kicking a stone across the beach
Aching for love and comfort out of reach;
The way ahead seems to be so bleak
There's no-one with any friendship left to speak
Or show you any relation
Between your present and future situations...
Lost to the dream

Away, away, away - look to the future day
For hope, some form of peace
Within the growing storm

I climb through the evening, alive and believing
In time we shall all know our goals and so, finally, home;
For now, all is secret - though how could I speak it
Allow me the dream in my eye!
I've been waiting for such a long time
Just to see it at last
All of the hands tightly clasped
All of us pilgrims
Walking in silence down the coast
Merely to journey - here hope is the most
Merely to know there is an end;
All of us - lovers, brothers, sisters, friends
Hand in hand...
Shining footprints on the wet sand
Lead to the dream

The time has come, the tide has almost run
And drained the deep:
I rise from lifelong sleep

It seems such a long time I've dreamed -
But now, awake, I can see
We are pilgrims and so must walk this road
Unknown in our purpose, alone, but not worthless
And home ever calling us on
We've been waiting here for so long
All of our hands joined in hope
Holding the weight on the rope -
All of us pilgrimsEmbed
