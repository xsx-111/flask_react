Polk Salad Annie Lyrics
Umm!
If some of ya'll never been down south too much
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this
So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods
And the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green
And ev'rybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Umm!
Used to know a girl lived down there
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause that's about all they had to eat, they did all right

Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her momma was a-workin' on the chain gang
(A mean, vicious woman) Umm!
Every day 'for suppertime, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tote sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp
Everybody says it was a shame
'Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman, heh-heh)
(Lord, have mercy, pick a mess of it)
Umm!
Her daddy was lazy and no 'count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons
Out of my truck patch
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny, whoa ooh-hoo
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her momma was a-workin' on the chain gang
(Sock a little polk salad to me
You know I need me a mess of it)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Good God
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Umm, umm, umm, umm, umm!
Got to have me
Ate her up, heh2Embed
