Wichita Lineman LyricsParoles de la chanson Wichita Lineman :
I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searching in the sun for another overload
I hear you singing in the wire
I can hear you thru the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it's snow that's stretched down south
Will never stand the strain
And I need you more then want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
And I need you more then want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the lineEmbed
