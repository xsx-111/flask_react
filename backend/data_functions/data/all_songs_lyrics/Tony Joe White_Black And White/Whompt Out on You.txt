Whompt Out on You LyricsYou're on my mind every day
Nighttime too
I can't get a thing done for thinkin' of you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I b'lieve I'm whompt out on you
Whompt out on you yeah
You know you really sock it to me
My head is spinnin' around
You know you're too much girl allright
You know you really put me down ungr
I don't know what I'm gonna do ya'all
I b'lieve I'm whompt out on you
Whompt out on you
Don't you know I can't sleep at night I roll all over my bed
I need you to hold me tight
I think I'm goin' out of my head ya'all
Oh I need ya
Uh I want you
Ungr Lord Ungr Ungr ....Embed
