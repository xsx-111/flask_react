Look of Love LyricsThe look of love is in your eyes
A look your smile can't disguise
The look of love
Is saying so much more then just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard well it takes my breath away
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around ya
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
You've got the look of love it's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start of so many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow and then seal it with a kiss
Oh I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love ya
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around ya
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever goEmbed
