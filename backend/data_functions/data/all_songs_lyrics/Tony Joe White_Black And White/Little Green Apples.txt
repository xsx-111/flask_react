Little Green Apples LyricsI wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she say "Hi!"
And I stumble over to the breakfast table
While the kids are going off to school, goodbye
And she reaches out an' takes my hand, squeezes it and says
"How you feelin' Hon?"
And I look across at smiling lips
That warm my heart and I see my morning sun
And if that's not loving me
Then all I've gotta say
Oh God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
There's no such thing as doctor Suess
Disneyland and Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme
Oh God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about a face a glow to ease my mind
And sometimes I call her up at home
Knowing all the time that she's busy
And I ask her if she could get away
And maybe meet me somewhere
And we can get a bite to eat
And you know she always drops what she's doing
And hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waiting patiently
And she smiles when she first sees me
Cause she is made that way
And if that is not loving me
Then all I've got to say
Oh God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes
There is no such thing as make believe
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves
And B.B. guns
Oh God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertimeEmbed
