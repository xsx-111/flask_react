Animals Lyrics
I'm mad and that's a fact
I found out animals don't help
Animals think they're pretty smart
Shit on the ground, see in the dark

They wander around like a crazy dog
Make a mistake in the parking lot
Always bumping into things
Always let you down, down, down, down

Animals think they understand
Trusting them a big mistake
Animals want to change my life
I will ignore animals' advice

They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them
They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them down, down, down, down

I know the animals are laughing at us
Don't even know what a joke is
I won't follow animals' advice
I don't care if they're laughing at us
They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them
They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them down, down, down

They say they don't need money, they're living on nuts and berries
They say animals don't worry, they're living on nuts and berries
You know animals are hairy? They say animals don't worry
They think they know what's best, they're making a fool of us
They ought to be more careful, they're setting a bad example
They say animals don't worry, they're living on nuts and berries
They're setting a bad example, they ought to be more careful
You know animals are hairy? They're living on nuts and berries
They want to know what's best, they're making a fool of us
They ought to be more careful, they're setting a bad example
They like to laugh at people, they're setting a bad example
They have untroubled lives, they think that every thing's nice
You know they don't need money? They say animals don't worry
They're living on nuts and berries, you know animals are hairy?
They think they know what's best, they're making a fool of us
They like to laugh at people, they're making a bad example
They say they don't need money, you know animals are hairy?
They're living on nuts and berries, they say they don't need money
They're setting a bad example, they ought to be more carefulEmbed
