Paper LyricsHold the paper up to the light
Some rays pass right through
Expose yourself out there for a minute
Some rays pass right through
Take a little rest when the rays pass through
Take a little time off when the rays pass through
Go ahead and mix it up, go ahead and tie it up
In a long distance telephone call
Hold on to that paper
Hold on to that paper
Hold on because it's been taken care of
Hold on to that paper
See if you can fit it on the paper
See if you can get it on the paper
See if you can fit it on the paper
See if you can get it on the paper
Had a love affair but it was only paper
Some rays they pass right through
Had a lot of fun, could have been a lot better
Some rays they pass right through
Take a little consideration, take every combination
Take a few weeks off, make it tighter, tighter
Even though it was never, it was never written down
Still might be a chance that it might work out
If you hold on to that paper
Hold on to that paper
Well, hold on, 'cause it'll be taken care of
Hold on to that paper
Don't think I can fit it on the paper
Don't think I can get it on the paper
Go ahead and rip up, rip up the paper
Go ahead and tear up, tear up the paperEmbed
