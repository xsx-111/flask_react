Electric Guitar Lyrics
Electric guitar is run over
By a car on the highway

This is a crime against the state
This is the meaning of life

Tune this electric guitar
Tune this electric guitar
T-tune this electric guitar
Tune this electric guitar

Electric guitar is plugged-in
Recording, “Fa”
Judge and the jury
Twelve members of the jury
All listening to records

Is this is a crime against the state?
Ah, this is the verdict they reach:

Never listen to electric guitar
Never listen to electric guitar
Never listen to electric guitar
Never listen to electric guitar
Electric guitar is copied
Copy sounds better
Call this law of justice, call this freedom and liberty
I thought I'd perjure myself right in front of the jury

Is this a crime against the state?
No, this is the verdict they reach:

Someone controls electric guitar
Someone controls electric guitar
Someone controls electric guitar
Someone controls electric guitarEmbed
