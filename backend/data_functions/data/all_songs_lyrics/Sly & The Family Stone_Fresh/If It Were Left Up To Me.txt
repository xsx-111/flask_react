If It Were Left Up To Me LyricsIf it were left up to me, it would take more than a notion
If it were left up to me, we could put ideas in motion
Had it been left up to you, would you try, would you try
If it were left up to me, I would try
If it were left up to me, we would live, yeah, in a bubble
If it were left up to me or you, we would stay out of trouble
But it's the way that they do (do us wrong), makes you cry, makes you cry
And still it's left up to you, got to try
If it were left up to you, would you sigh and forget it
And get some sleeping to see if you live to regret it
Now that it's left up to me and you, Will you try, will you try
I promise from me to you, I will try
I promise from me to you, I will try
