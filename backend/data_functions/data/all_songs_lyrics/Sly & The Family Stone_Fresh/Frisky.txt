Frisky LyricsI'll be down, when you're gone
Call me back on the telephone
Lil ol', lil ol', lil ol' name and a title
I gets all the way down
If I don't keep smilin' wit' y'all
You gonna see me frown
That's why I keep music
All around the bed
So I can call Frisky
Very hard to be led in the wrong direction
Frisky, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh Frisky, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh Frisky, yeah, yeah, oh Frisky, yeah yeah yeah
Put a little tickle on the Jones' head
Turn off the lights and go to bed
Have you ever ever stopped a rainbow?
I don't think so at least
To the fog and Frisky, afternoon feast
Energy the jailer
Wanna keep it in check
Gonna check with my tailor
'Cause I don't give a heck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Frisky, yeah
Oh Frisky, yeah yeah yeah
Oh Frisky, ah huh huh
Frisky, yeah yeah yeah
Put a little tickle on the Jones' head
Turn off the lights and go to bed
Under-under-understand the
Power of a little heart
Applying the wrong pressure
Makes for a slower start, yeah
Stroke town today
Though wind chills strong
I feel overworked if Frisky is wrong
You can talk to FriskyEmbed
