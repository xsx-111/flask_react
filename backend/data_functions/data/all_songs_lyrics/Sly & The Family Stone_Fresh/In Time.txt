In Time LyricsThere's a mickey in the tasting of disaster
In time (in time) you get faster
Harry Hippie is a waste as if he has ta
Procrastinatin'
Something moving in the brain of a doer
In time (in time) feel a little newer
I switched from coke to pep and I'm a connoisseur
Mmm-hmm ('bout time)
'Cause there's a method in the madness of the thinking
In time (in time) oh we oughta
It seems the best of all the sadness is a sinkin'
In time (in time) muddy water
And there's a wreck yard in the mind of a quitter
In time (in time) he's gonna git bitter
He don't give a heck or is he blind and makin' litter
In time ('bout time) gonna need a babysitter
I felt so good I told the leader how to follow
In time (in time) get down
Sho' glad I could not feel indeed so very hollow
No need to follow
Insecurities attracting every flirter
In time (in time) yeah, it's murder
If you don't mind please why give slack to a deserter
In time ('bout time)
Well, well, oh well, daylight is all I see
Stay light and wait for me
See you tomorrow noon
Miss me, I'll see you soon
I told you it's not the teachin' it's the learning
In time (in time) don't need no burning
When I mold you to start reaching in the mornin'
In time
Well, well, there's a feeling oh so real in every human
On time ('bout time)
There's a reeling when you don't know what you're doing
In time ('bout time)
Hey, hey
Stay around to get a show
(In time) Don't you know
Two years, too long to wait
Two words, get it straight
(In time) See an answer in time
(In time) And that ain't nothing, I'm a dancer
Two years, too long to wait
Two words, get it straight
Two years, too long to wait
Two words, get it straight
Ah, yessir, yessir, yeah
Two years, too long to wait
Two words, get it straight
In time, in time
Two years, too long to wait
Two words, get it straight1Embed
