Dance, Dance, Dance Lyrics
Having trouble telling how I feel
But I can dance, dance, dance
Couldn't possibly tell you how I mean
But I can dance, dance, dance
So when I trip on my feet, look at the beat
The words are written in the sand
When I'm shaking my hips, look for the swing
The words are written in the air

Ooh dance, I was a dancer all along
Dance, dance, dance
Words can never make up for what you do

Easy conversations
There's no such thing
No, I'm shy, shy, shy
My hips they lie cause in reality
I'm shy, shy, shy
But when I trip on my feet, look at the ground
The words are written in the dust
When I'm shaking my hips, look for the swing
The words are written in the air
Ooh dance, I was a dancer all along
Dance, dance, dance
Words could never make up for what you do
