Little Bit Lyrics
Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinking of
But how we move from A to B
It can't be up to me cause you don't know
Eye to eye, thigh to thigh, I let go

I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me

And for you I keep my legs apart
And forget about my tainted heart
And I will never ever be the first to say it
But still I, you know I
I would do it
Push a button, pull the trigger, climb a mountain, jump off a cliff
Cause you know baby, I love you, love you a little bit
You would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, and we could do it
It was you and I, not only

I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me
Come here, stay with me, stroke me by the hair
Cause I would give anything, anything, to have you as my man
Come here, stay with me, stroke me by the hair
Cause I would give anything, anything, to have you as my man

Little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit, little bit

Little bit
Little bit
Little bit
Little bit, little bit14Embed
