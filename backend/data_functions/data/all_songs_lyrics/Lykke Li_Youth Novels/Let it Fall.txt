Let it Fall Lyrics
Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall, let it fall

So I weep
So I weep
So I weep
So I weep

In my weakest moments, I weep
'Cause I like the way tears fit my cheek
In my darkest moments, I cry
Oh how I love the way tears suits my face

I like it salt, I like it wet
Like my makeup in a mess
So I cry hard, let it fall
And I won't stop until my tears are all shed

So I weep
So I weep
So I weep
So I weep
So I weep
So I weep
And I won't stop until my tears are all shed
Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall, let it fall

In my joyous moments, I moan
'Cause it feels so good when I let my water flow
Drip drop, and I cannot stop
Can't stop, no, I said no
Drip drop, and I cannot stop
Can't stop
I cry for you, cry for you
I cry because I cannot help it
So it runs, yeah, it falls
And ain't no stopping at all

I like it salt, I like it wet
Like my makeup in a mess
So I cry hard, let it fall
And I won't stop until my tears are all shed

So I weep
So I weep
So I weep
So I weep
So I weep
So I weep
And I won't stop until my tears are all shed
Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall, let it fall

So I weep
So I weep
So I weep
And I won't stop until my tears are all shed

Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall2Embed
