Tonight Lyrics
Watch my back so I'll make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday the night before tomorrow

Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me

And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

You walk the surface of this town
The high heels above the ground
And high horses that we know
Keep us safe until the night

You know them all, I know it all
Stay put and play along
Cause I'm looking for my friend
Now I got you, got you
And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

I dry my eye, dry my eye
Falling deeper by the hour
Dry my eye
Dry my eye, dry my eye
Don't let me fall deeper now
Dry my eye

Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go

Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight2Embed
