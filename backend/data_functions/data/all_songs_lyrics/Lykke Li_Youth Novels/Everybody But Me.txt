Everybody But Me Lyrics
Ooh, I stand here in the corner
Thinking over, one, two
What am I to do?
Should I go home still sober?
Or should I buy me another glass of wine
And forget about time?

But my jeans are too tight
Don't feel like dancing
No, this light is too bright
Don't feel like shining
No, this room is too small
Rather stand against the wall
And hope that no one sees me

When everybody's dancing (I don't want to)
When everybody's toying (I don't want to)
When everybody's laughing (I don't want to)
Everybody but me
When everybody's drinking (I don't want to)
When everybody's using (I don't need more)
When everybody's floating (I don't want to)
Everybody but me, yeah
I get the creeps
From all the people in here
I cannot breathe
It's too crowded in here
Don't look at me
I don't wanna be seen, touched, heard, bothered
By the fellas who got the look in their eye
They wanna take me home without knowing my name
They wanna put it on
But do they not know that I'm not like the others?

When everybody's dancing (I don't want to)
When everybody's toying (I don't want to)
When everybody's laughing (I don't want to)
Everybody but me
When everybody's drinking (I don't want to)
When everybody's using (I don't need more)
When everybody's floating (I don't want to)
Everybody but me
When everybody's dancing (I don't want to)
When everybody's toying (I don't want to)
When everybody's laughing (I don't want to)
Everybody but me
When everybody's drinking (I don't want to)
When everybody's using (I don't need more)
When everybody's floating (I don't want to)
Everybody but me
When everybody's dancing (I don't want to)
When everybody's toying (I don't want to)
When everybody's laughing (I don't need more)
Everybody but me
When everybody's drinking (I don't want to)
When everybody's using (I don't want to)
When everybody's floating (I don't want to)
Everybody but me, yeah2Embed
