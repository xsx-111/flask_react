Melodies & Desires LyricsFollow these instructions
Do exactly as I do
Lean your shoulders forward
Let your hands slide over to my side
Move your body closer
Let your heart meet mine
Love is the harmony
Desire is the key
Love is the melody
Now sing it with me
Come a little closer
Take a look at me
This light is so obvious
I want you to see
Come a little closer
Look me in the eye
Then repeat with me
One more time
Love is the harmony
Desire is the key
Love is a symphony
Now play it with me
Love is the harmony
Desire is the key
Love is a symphony
Now play it with me
You'll be the rhythm and I'll be the beat
You'll be the rhythm and I'll be the beat
Then I'll be the rhythm and you'll be the beat
And love, the shoreline, where you and I meet
You'll be the rhythm and I'll be the beat
You'll be the rhythm and I'll be the beat
Then I'll be the rhythm and you'll be the beat
And love, the shoreline, where you and I meet
Love is the harmony
Desire is the key
Love is a symphony
Come, sing some with me3Embed
