Hanging High LyricsOh, thunder in my heart
These razors cutting sharp
And leaves me with an ever bleeding scar
So soft, so suddenly
So that I cannot breathe
I'm drawn into a circle painted black
Oh, I'm hanging high
Oh, won't you let me down?
Back where I started at
You know I'm a little lost
And when it hurts the most
I'll push a little more
I'm back where I started at
You know I'm a little lost
Like lightning in my heart
A kiss so burning hot
I'm hanging on a thread that's bound to drop
Like rain on open skies
Don't know the reason why
But I'll always choose the black in front of white
Oh, I'm hanging high
Oh, won't you let me down?
Back where I started at
You know I'm a little lost
And when it hurts the most
I'll push a little more
I'm back where I started at
You know I'm a little lost
Oh, I'm hanging high
Oh, won't you let me down?
Back where I started at
When it hurts the most
I'll push a little more
I'm back where I started atEmbed
