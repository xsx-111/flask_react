My Love LyricsI miss you man
Where have you gone?
I miss you much
I miss you long
So many men
Where did you go?
Over seas, under chairs
Oh lover boy
You're hiding out
Oh could it be
I passed you by a thousand times before
Not knowing who you were
My love will come, my love will come
My love
For you i wait, for you i wait
My love
My love it burns, my love it burns
My love
My love will come, my love will come
My love
Solitude
I'm doing fine
I dance alone
With my head high
Oh solitude it's so sublime
To swing alone
The choice is mine
To wait while others play
To let my lover wait
My love will come, my love will come
My love
For you i sing, for you i sing
My love
My love it burns, my love it burns
My love
My love will come, my love will come
My love
My love will come, my love will come
My love
For you i sing, for you i sing
My love
My love it burns, my love it burns
My love
My love will come, my love will come
My love
My love will come, my love will come
My love
My love will come, my love will come
My love
My love will come, my love will come
My love
My love will come, my love will come
My love
My love will come, my love will come
My love
My love will come, my love will come
