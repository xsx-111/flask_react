Time Flies Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I sit tight, don't wanna miss the show
I hang on, don't wanna miss my prime
Time will fly, upon my baby's back
Time will fly, upon my baby's back

Stay awhile, my baby wants me to
Don't you go, my baby begs me so
But tide will dry, upon my baby's back
Tide will dry, upon my baby's back

And I get weak, I get weary
I miss sleep, I get moody
I'm in thoughts, I write songs
I'm in love, I walk on

So, fingers crossed, my time is coming now
Don't you go, my baby begs me so
Time will fly, upon my baby's back
Time will fly, upon my baby's back
And I get weak, I get weary
I miss sleep, I get moody
I'm in thoughts, I write songs
I'm in love, I walk on

So, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oohEmbed
