Window Blues LyricsI sleep with windows open
I sleep with eyes wide
In case you would come walk in
In case you change your mind
But don't strain yourself for me
Don't break yourself for me
Don't lose your selfish ways for me
I keep a leash around you
And I keep it nice and tight
In case you would go walking
Over forbidden lines
But don't go all soft on me
Don't come across for me
Don't lose your selfish ways over me
Un, deux, trois
Quatre, cinq, six
A hundred times around
You keep on flunking out
Keep me wanting more
Un, deux, trois
Quatre, cinq, six
A hundred times is fine
For you I go all blind
Oh my, where is my mind?
I keep my window open
I keep it open wide
So keep me keep it open
Oh keep me on your mindEmbed
