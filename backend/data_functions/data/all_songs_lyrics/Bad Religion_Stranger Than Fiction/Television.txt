Television Lyrics
Television! Television! Television! Television!
Television! Television! Television! Television!

Oh yeah, I want to bask in your golden light
Submerge in electric waves, I need my connection
To the world outside

Yeah, the world outside is buzzing like an angry wasp in summer
The candidates are running, and the son of God is coming
Crackle mental convolutions tune in to the revolution
Now everyone's included, so we never gotta be alone

Television! Television! Television! Television!
Television! Television! Television! Television!

Oh yeah, I want to bathe in your golden light
Submerge in electric waves, I need my injection
From the world outside

Yeah, every atom in my body, blood, sinew, bone and fiber
I can't distill you from my blood, you're like a hungry germ inside of me
You're my lover, my heroine, my conscience, and my voice
And I know now that I have learned to let you in, I will never have to be alone
Television! Television! Television! Television!
Television! Television! Television! Television!

Oh yeah, I want to bathe in your golden light
Submerge in electric waves


I'd take after my mother, but she's from a different generation
I prefer my big brother, he's so gentle and understanding
I learn what I can by the television light
But when I'm alone, I know it's going to be alright
Be alright

Television! Television! Television! Television!
Television! Television! Television! Television!Embed
