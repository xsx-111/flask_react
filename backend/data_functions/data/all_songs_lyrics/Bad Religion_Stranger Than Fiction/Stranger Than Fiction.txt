Stranger Than Fiction Lyrics
A febrile shocking violent smack
And the children are hoping for a heart-attack
Tonight the windows are watching, the streets all conspire
And the lamppost can't stop crying
If I could fly high above the world
Would I see a bunch of living dots spell the word "stupidity?"
Or would I see hungry lover homicides, loving brother suicides
And olly olly oxen frees who pick a side and hide?

(Ah-ah-ah) The world is scratching at my door
(Ah-ah-ah) My morning paper's got the scores
(Ah, ah, ah) The human interest stories
And the obituary, oh yeah

Cockroach naps, rattling traps
How many devils can you fit upon a match head?
Caringosity killed the Kerouac cat
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction

In my alley 'round the corner, there's a wino with feathered shoulders
And a spirit giving head for crack and he'll never want it back
There's a little kid and his family eating crackers like Thanksgiving
And a pack of wild desperadoes scornful of living
(Ah-ah-ah) The world is scratching at my door
(Ah-ah-ah) My morning paper has the scores
(Ah, ah, ah) The human interest stories
And the obituary, oh yeah

Cradle for a cat, Wolfe looks back
How many angels can you fit upon a match?
I wanna know why Hemingway cracked
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction

Life is the crummiest book
I ever read, there isn't a hook
Just a lot of cheap shots, pictures to shock
And characters an amateur would never dream up
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction1Embed
