Leave Mine to Me Lyrics
There are desperate times upon us, there are codes of white and black
Political resentment, and people start to crack
There's hate and opposition, there's fumbling dialogue
And you sit there and judge me and you think it makes a difference

If you think I'm all alone, you are foolishly wrong
There's an entire army who blindly follow along
And you happen to be one of them, believe it or not
Even though you try not to be, we are of the same plague

The other ways we're taught to fear
Don't even scratch the surface of the problem here
But I'm not blind, and I'm not scared
So many crucial factors exist out there
And we're but one, and they're but two
And how we come to terms will help us pull through

Things cannot change too fast, it took us this much time
To reach our current platform and walk this fragile line
If I thought I'd make a difference, I'd kill myself today
But so many are like me, lost in the fray
You create your own reality
And leave mine to me, leave mine to me
Leave mine to me, leave mine to me1Embed
