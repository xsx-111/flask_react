The Handshake Lyrics
Every time you shake someone's hand
And it feels like your best friend
Could it be that it's only superficiality?
Without regard to well-being
Without an inkling of compromise
Handshakes are nothing but a subtle "fuck you"
And contracts determine the best friendships

This is the way of the modern world
Everyone's vying for patronage
This is the way of the modern world
And something's gotta give

Every time you shake someone's hand
And you share neither color nor creed
Got to overcome the obstacles of history
There is restrained passion, mistrust, and bigotry
And these have created the new foundations of society
There's no harmony, just class and race

This is the way of the modern world
Everyone's fighting for dominance
This is the way of the modern world
And something's gotta give
Now, I believe in unity
And I am willing to compromise
But I'm not gonna lie or sell my soul


Every time you shake someone's hand
It determines where you stand
And if you won't uphold your side, it's better to...

Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
(I believe in unity)
Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
(And I am willing to compromise)
Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
(I believe in unity)
Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
(But I'm not gonna lie or sell my soul)
Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
Someone's gotta give!Embed
