Infected Lyrics

Now here I go, hope I don't break down
I won't take anything, I don't need anything
Don't want to exist, I can't persist
Please stop before I do it again

Just talk about nothing
Let's talk about nothing
Let's talk about no one
Please talk about no one, someone, anyone!

You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, you're addicted
You and me, you and me

I'm on the edge, get against the wall
I'm so distracted, I love to strike you
Here's my confession, you learned your lesson
Stop me before I do it again
Just talk about nothing
Let's talk about nothing
Let's talk about no one
Please talk about no one, someone, anyone

You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, you're addicted
You and me, you and me

You're clear as a heavy lead curtain
Want to drill you like an ocean
We can work it out, I've been running out
Now I'm running out, don't be mad about it baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You and me have a disease
I want to tie you, crucify you
(You affect me, you infect me)
Kneel before you, revile your body
(I'm afflicted, you're addicted)
You and me were made in heaven
(You and me have a disease)
I want to take you, I want to break you
(You affect me, you infect me)
Supplicate you with thorny roses
(I'm afflicted, you're addicted)
You and me are incurable
(You and me have a disease)
I want to bathe you in holy water
(You affect me, you infect me)
I want to kill you upon the altar
(I'm afflicted, you're addicted)
You and me, you and meEmbed
