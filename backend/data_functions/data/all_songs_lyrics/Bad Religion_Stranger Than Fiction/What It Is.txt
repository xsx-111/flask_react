What It Is Lyrics
If there's a purpose and there's a goal
There's virtuous and immoral
There's a reason for all of this
But I don't know what it is

I am one and plural, too
I accept them, but they exclude
I could make sense of all of this
But I don't know what it is

The seeds of inspiration never germinated in my mind
The beacon of awakening is somewhere that I can't find
So I don't know what it is


There's a beginning and there's an end
There's a climax, some would contend
There's a way to signify this
But I don't know what it is

The seeds of inspiration never germinated in my mind
The beacon of awakening is somewhere that I can't find
So I don't know what it is
Show me something more definitive
I don't know what it is1Embed
