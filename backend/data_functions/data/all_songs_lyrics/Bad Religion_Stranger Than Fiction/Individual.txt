Individual Lyrics
Ah, forget it

Individuals run for cover
For the multitude of thoughtless clones
Have reached a critical mass
Have reached a critical mass
Individuals hide in fear
Under cover, sheltered by the wafer
Thin veil of intelligence
Thin veil of intelligence

Individuals, nowhere to be seen
Ah-ah-ah-ah...

Urbana is oozing
Like a bloated carcass with maggots
Cooking in the desert heat
Cooking in the desert heat
Oozing with progeny, writhing
And desperate for input from
Someone more determined
Someone more determined
Congregating in invisible circles
Half a part and half apart
All too aware of the insignificance
Pushing on with soul and heart

Ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah

Individuals don't pray for forgiveness
When pinned up against the wall
Under siege of persecution
Under siege of persecution
Individuals command exception
And accept dichotomy
Maybe you can't choose anymore
Maybe you can't choose anymore

(Ah-ah, ah) Procreation without gain or purpose
(Ah-ah, ah) Languid wills and torpid minds
(Ah-ah, ah, ah) Catapulted ever faster
(Ah, ah, ah) By the arrow of time
(Ah-ah, ah) You take yours, and I'll keep mine
