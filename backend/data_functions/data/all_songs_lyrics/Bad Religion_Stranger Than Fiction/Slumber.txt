Slumber Lyrics
So, you're feeling unimportant
'Cause you've got nothing to say
And your life is just a ramble
No one understands you anyway
Well, I've got a piece of news, son
That might make you change your mind
Your life is historically meaningful
And spans a significant time

Slumber will come soon
And you are helping to put it to sleep
Side by side, we do our share, faithfully assuring
That slumber will come soon

Well, now, do you feel a little better?
Lift up your head and walk away
Knowing we're all in this together
For such a short time anyway

There is just no time to parade around sulking
(Slumber will come soon)
I would rather laugh than cry
(Slumber will come soon)
The rich, the poor, the strong, the weak, we share this place together
(Slumber will come soon)
And we pitch in to help it die
We pitch in to help it die!

I'm not too good at giving morals
And I don't fear the consequence
If life makes you scared and bitter
At least it's not for very long

Slumber will come soon
And you are helping put it to sleep
Side by side we do our share, faithfully assuring
That slumber will come soon

Slumber will come soon
(Slumber will come soon)
Slumber will come soon
(Slumber will come soon)
(Slumber will come soon)
Slumber will come soonEmbed
