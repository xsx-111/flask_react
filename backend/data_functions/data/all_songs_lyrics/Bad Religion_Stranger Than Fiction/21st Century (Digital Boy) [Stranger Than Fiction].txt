21st Century (Digital Boy)  Lyrics
I can't believe it
The way you look sometimes
Like a trampled flag on a city street
Oh yeah
And I don't want it
The things you're offering me
Symbolized bar code, quick ID
Oh yeah

'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to live  but I got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle-class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual
Ain't life a mystery, yeah?

I can't explain it
The things you're saying to me
It's going, "Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya"
Oh yeah

'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to read, but I got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle-class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual
Ain't life a mystery, yeah?
Tried to tell you about no contro-o-ol
But now, I really don't know
And then you told me how bad you had to suffer
Is that really all you have to offer?


'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to live but, I got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle-class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual

Cat's foot, iron claw
(21st century digital boy)
Neurosurgeon screams for more
(21st century digital boy)
Innocence raped with napalm fire
(21st century digital boy)
Everything I want, I really need
(21st century digital boy)
Ain't life a mystery, yeah?3Embed
