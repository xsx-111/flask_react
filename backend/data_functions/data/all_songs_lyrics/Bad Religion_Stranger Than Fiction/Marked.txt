Marked Lyrics
If I'm a monster, I am a willing one
This roller coaster ride is an enticing one
On the tip of a continuum, flowing wavelike through disorder
Carrying me like a vessel to water

And everything you see leaves a mark on your soul
Everything you feel leaves a mark on your soul
Everything you touch leaves a mark on your soul
Everything you make leaves a mark on your soul

If I can touch it, I can destroy it
If it's imaginable, to some degree, I can become it
Like a hungry fucking vortex that just flickers to existence
Consuming bits and pieces 'til I'm finally extinguished

Everyone you see leaves a mark on your soul
Everyone you bare leaves a mark on your soul
Everyone you touch leaves a mark on your soul
Everyone you love leaves a mark on your soul, oh!

And everything you take leaves a mark on your soul
Everything you give leaves a mark on your soul
And all the fear and loneliness that's impossible to control
And every tear you cry leaves a mark on your soulEmbed
