Incomplete Lyrics
Mother, father
Look at your little monster
I'm a hero, I'm a zero
I'm the butt of the worst joke in history

I'm a lock without a key, a city with no door
A prayer without faith, a show without a score
A bad word, a wink, a nod, a shiver
An untold story, sex without purity
A creeping gray memory

I am...
Incomplete, incomplete
Incomplete, incomplete

Doctor, cure me
What is the cause of my condition
This madness shoots me
Like bullets smashing glass in a silent movie

I'm a trap without a spring, a temple with no god
A jack without an ace, the tip of your tongue
I'm a promise, an unmailed letter
An unbuilt motor, deck without a joker
A creeping gray memory
I am...
Incomplete, incomplete
Incomplete, incomplete


Tell Saint Peter not to bet on me, yeah
I got a naked obsession
A good intention gone bad

I am...
Incomplete, incomplete
Incomplete, incomplete
Incomplete, incomplete
