Hooray for Me... Lyrics
Well, I can see my teenage father standing straight on a desolate corner
In a shadow of tentacled towers by the red light of America
I imagine how his mother felt
When she heard that her husband was dying
And the underground heroes of the tarmac, shooting smack
Were blowing up worlds and damned out loud
Hey, can you tell me, "How does it feel?"

Yeah, tell me

Can you imagine for a second
Doing anything that you don't have to?
Well, that's what I'm accustomed to
So hooray for me... And fuck you!

When I slept with stony faces on the riverbank
My angel-devil reveler shook me desperately and dying
I don't exactly want to apologize for anything
And now we're all mad and tangled
In secret rooms with Roman candles
On an endless graveyard train
Yeah, tell me

Can you imagine for a second
Doing anything just 'cause you want to?
Well, that's just what I do
So hooray for me... And fuck you!

Yeah, I was dreaming through the "how's life," yawning car black headlamp night
She told me, "Mad and meaningless as ever"
And a song came on my radio like a cemetery rhyme
For a million crying corpses in their tragedy
Of respectable existence


Tell me

Can you imagine for a second
Trying half the things you ever wanted to?
Well, that's just what I do
So hooray for me... Oh yeah
I'm unrespectable, never sensible
Maybe incredible, so damned irascible
I like the things I do, so hooray for me...
And fuck you!1Embed
