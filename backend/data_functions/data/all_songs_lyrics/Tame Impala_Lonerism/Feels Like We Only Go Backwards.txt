Feels Like We Only Go Backwards Lyrics
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day
When I realise I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show

It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's the way it seems to go
When trying so hard to get to something real, it feels

It feels like I only go backwards, darling
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling77Embed
