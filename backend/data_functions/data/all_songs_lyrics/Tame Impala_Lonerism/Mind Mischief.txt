Mind Mischief Lyrics
Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my lover, taking it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong (No, no)

How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge runnin' low
I tried to fill but it overflowed

Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my lover taking it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong

She remembers my name
Could be blowin' way out
It's all going to change
She remembers my name

But sheâ€™s only messing around
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go Mr. Right just for once
(Then it all just came out)
Ooh, no more mischief with my mind
(Guess I'll hold in, next time...)
No more gettin' it wrong
I'll be frozen, here on
If forever, we'll see
No more guessin' for me

Oh, I was just so sure of everything
Oh, that's what you get for dreamin' aloud
(Then it all just came out)
(Guess I'll hold in, now on)
(If forever, we'll see)
Oh, the day that words are clearer for me
(But no more guessing for me)42Embed
