Moonlight in Glory LyricsBefore God destroyed the people on the earth, he warned Noah to build an Ark. And after Noah built his Ark, I believe he told Noah to warn the people, that they must change all their wicked ways before he come upon them and destroy them
And when Noah had done built his Ark, I understand that somebody began to rend a song. And the song began to move on, I understand, like this:
Moon, ah the moon
(Move on)
Moon, ah the moon
(I understand, like this)
Moon, ah the moon
(And when Noah had done built his Ark)
Moonlight in glory, oh by the moon
(Move on)
So they get tired, it was come dark, it rained and they were very tired
And then he went and knocked on Old Lady house. Old Lady ran to the door, saying "Who is this?"
Jack said "me, mama-san, could we spend the night here? 'Cause we're far from home, very tired." and Old Lady said "oh yes, come on in."
Moon, ah the moon
(Come on in)
Moon, ah the moon
(So I'm realizing I'm in trouble)
Moon, ah the moon
(It was come dark, it rained and they were very tired)
Moonlight in glory, oh by the moonEmbed
