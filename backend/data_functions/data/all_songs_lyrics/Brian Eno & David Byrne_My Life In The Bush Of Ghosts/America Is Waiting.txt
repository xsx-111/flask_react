America Is Waiting Lyrics
America is waiting for a message of some sort or another
Takin' it again
Again!
Again!
Takin' it again
Well now... no, no... now, we ought to be mad at the government not mad at the people
Takin' it again
Again! Again!
Takin' it again
I mean, yeah, well... wha-what're ya gonna do?
America is waiting for a message of some sort or another
No will whatsoever. No will whatsoever! Absolutely no honor
No will whatsoever. No will whatsoever! Absolutely no integrity
No will whatsoever. No will whatsoever! I haven't seen any any any citizen over there stand up and say "Hey, just a second."
No will whatsoever. No will whatsoever! I mean, yeah, so... wha-what're ya gonna do?
America is waiting for a message of some sort or anotherEmbed
