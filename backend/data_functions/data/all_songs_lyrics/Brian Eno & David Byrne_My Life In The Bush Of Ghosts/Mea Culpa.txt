Mea Culpa Lyrics
What he said, he said "I'm sorry, I committed a sin, I made a mistake. I asked (?) to forgive me, please forgive me." He said "mea culpa," can you put it better?
I'm saying I'm sorry, I made a mistake, I made... I committed a sin, I made a mistake. and I'm never gonna do it again, I never did it before and I'm never gonna do it again
