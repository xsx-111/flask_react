The Jezebel Spirit LyricsHa ha ha ha ha ha ha...
Do you hear voices?
You do. So you are possessed?
You are a believer, born again and yet you hear voices and you are possessed
Okay, Now are you ready to be delivered?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...
Put your head over there
This is from the pit of Hell
Okay Sister
You have a Jezebel spirit within you
You have a spirit of grief
You have a spirit destruction
Jezebel...
Spirit of destruction!
Spirit of grief!
I bind you with chains of iron!
I bind you (mumbles in tongues)
Bow to the Heavens!
Lessen your hold and come out of her now!
Start blowing out, Sister...
Out!
Out Jezebel. Come out now!
Go ahead...
Out in the name of Jesus!
Come out destruction!
Come out destruction!
Come on grief!
Jezebel, you're going listen to me!
Jezebel!
Go ahead sister...
Keep blowing
Jezebel, I bind you!
She was intended by God to be a virtuous woman
You have no right there
Her husband is the head of the house
Out Jezebel!
Out!
Out!
In Jesus' name
That's right
I break your power Jezebel!
(unintelligible)
Go ahead, Sister!
Go ahead, Sister!
Move your head
(unintelligible...)Embed
