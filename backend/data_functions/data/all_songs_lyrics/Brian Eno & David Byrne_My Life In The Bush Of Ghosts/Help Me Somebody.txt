Help Me Somebody LyricsTalkin' funny and lookin' funny--

--and talkin' 'bout "nobody judge me," you make yourself look bad!
Help me somebody!
You need to take a good look at yourself and see if you're the kind of person that God wants you to be!

It's no big thing, it's a small thing

What... people... think!
Help me somebody!
There's no escape from Him!
He's so high you can't get over Him!

He's so low you can't get under Him! He's so wide you can't get around Him! If you make your bed in Heaven, He's there! If you make your bed in Hell, He's there! He's everywhere!

Woo!
Help me somebody!
Woo!
Help me somebody!
Aaaaaaaaaah, I know!
Aaaaaaaaaah, I know!
Aaaaaaaaaah, I know!
Aaaaaaaaaah, I know!
Aaaaaaaaaah, I know!
Aaaaaaaaaah, I know!
Aaaaaaaaaah, I know!
Aaaaaaaaaah, I know!
Aaaaaaaaaah, I know!
Aaaaaaaaaah, I know!Embed
