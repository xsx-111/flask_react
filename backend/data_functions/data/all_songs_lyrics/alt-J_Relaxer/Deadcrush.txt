Deadcrush Lyrics
(Extra) Ordinarily pretty teeth
Beauty lingers out of reach
You're my DC oh Lee, oh
Man Ray went cray cray over you
Capturing but never captured
You're my DC oh Lee, oh

Swim low
In the back dry in the night
Sample
Put it there, get the money (Watch me now)
In the back of a Volvo car
Sample
Hold over
Pay up, sign up LA

Anna Bolina, maid of honour
Not your sister, fearful temper
You're my DC oh Anna, oh
Unknown artist took your likeness
Henry Tudor left you lifeless
You're my DC oh Anna, oh
Keepa, keepa, keepa, keep me damn down
Let it low
Let me know where you go (Watch me now)
Papa, papa, papa
Get me down
Deep, deep down
Pablo, let me know

If you don't have the ace of hearts
My dear, you're a lost man
Falcon for you, Anna, from the left arm of the falconer
Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna L'Arl√©sienne

Swim low
In the back dry in the night
Sample
Put it there, get the money (Watch me now)
In the back of a Volvo car
Sample
Hold over
Pay up, sign up LA
Swim low
In the back dry in the night
Sample
Put it there, get the money (Watch me now)
In the back of a Volvo car
Sample
Hold over
Pay up, sign up LA
Watch me now17Embed
