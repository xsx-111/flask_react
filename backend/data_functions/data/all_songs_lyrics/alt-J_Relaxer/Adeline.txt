Adeline Lyrics
Ooh, my Adeline, ooh
Down in Tasmania
Where the devil's jaws are far too weak
To tear you away

Ooh, I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

Ooh, my Adeline
I watch your morning swim again
Ooh, Kodachrome blue sky
Strokes from patch to warm patch
My sweet Adeline

Ooh, I wish you well (My Adeline)
I wish you well
I wish you well (My Adeline)
I wish you well

And the old triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the Royal Canal
My Adeline was swimming; sweet Adeline was singing
To the tune of the Royal Canal
She's a swim, swimmer
Swimmer, swimmer
Swim, swimmer
Swimmer, swimmer

And the old triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the Royal Canal
My Adeline was swimming; sweet Adeline was singing
To the tune of the Royal Canal

I wish her well (My Adeline)
I wish her well
I wish her well (My Adeline)
I wish her well
I wish her well30Embed
