All Alone Together Lyrics(Paul Cotton)
If you see me fallin'
By the wayside callin'
Pick me up and let me start again
This old road has a way
Of takin' me down a little each day
And I can't see my way around the bend
All the things I like to take
Cost so much more than I make
And it's hard keepin' even either way
And so I'm headed for the bar
Or another round of cards
And like the game we play it as they lay
And we're all alone together
On a road that seems forever
To be takin' you from yours and me from mine
And though we know just where we're goin'
There are changes that ain't showin'
Night and day become the same fine line
Night and day become the same fine lineEmbed
