P.N.S. (When You Come Around) Lyrics(Paul Cotton)
I've got my head up on the ceiling
And I can't see myself lookin' down
At a heartthat has no feelin'
And I could not care when you come around
I'm tryin' to find a way to tell you
Oh, my woman, you got to leave
And leave my life and try to make do
To somebody who will believe
If they could see through you to all of your lies
And take some time and maybe realize
That it's over before it began
And you're leavin' to find another man, oh
I've got my head up on the ceiling
And I can't see myself lookin' down
At a heartthat has no feelin'
And I could not care when you come around
And I could not care when you come aroundEmbed
