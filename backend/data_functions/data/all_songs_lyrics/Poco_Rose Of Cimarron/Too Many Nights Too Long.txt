Too Many Nights Too Long Lyrics(Paul Cotton)
As the moon goes fading
He lies awake waiting
For a break in the night
When he makes he's lonely flight
And it's the same old story
Somebody bound for glory
And somewhere in my life
I swear it had to belong
I've been countin' the stars
As they come on through the bars
And I've been heard singin'
A sad man's song
It's time for busting
Out of this jail
And get me a gun
No time for bail
And I've been here too many nights too long
And now I wonder if
They'll find me tonight
I've been sleepin' in the day
Runnin' below the pale moonlight
Hidin' in a canebrake
From a man I can't seem to shake
And in my head
I'm hearing a southern song
Mississippi
Roll on in my brain
And keep me sheltered
In the summer rain
I could never stay here too many nights too long
And now I wonder if
They'll find me tonight
I've been sleepin' in the day
Runnin' below the pale moonlight
Escondido en un canaveral
De un hombre que no puedo ver
Y el hombre, escondido
De donde sera
Mississippi
Roll on in my brain
And keep me sheltered
In the summer rain
I could never stay here too many nights too long
I could never stay here too many nights too longEmbed
