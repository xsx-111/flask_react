Just Like Me Lyrics(Timothy B. Schmit)
Everybody says you look like a dove
I agree
I think I know what they're thinkin' of
But every time they tell me you don't know how to love
Don't you know
I know that you're just tickin' it off
Just like me
And every time you call you have given it up
You refuse
To let yourself drink from the cup
It's easy to see for you times have been tough
But don't you know
I know that you're just callin' your own bluff
Don't you ever look around?
You're not the only one who's lost but could be found
Just like me
Late at night you're thinkin' you're crazy
But you really know better
Just like me
People try to tell you that you're heavy
But you're light as a feather
Just like me
I came home on Monday you were hangin' around
Not alone
Of which I didn't know then I found
That if I choose to see with my eyes to the ground
Well don't you know
I might as well be tied up and then bound
You were handed such a prize
I can onmly hope that you came outr more the wise
Just like me
Late at night you're thinkin' you're crazxy
But you're light as a feather
Just like me
People try to tell you that you're heavy
But you're light as a feather
Just like meEmbed
