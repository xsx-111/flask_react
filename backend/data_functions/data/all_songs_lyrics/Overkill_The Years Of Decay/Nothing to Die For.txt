Nothing to Die For LyricsOld enough to know better
Too young to care
Bent on self destruction
Goin' nowhere
If I had a reason
I could make it work for me
If I had an answer
It wouldn't be so hard to see
Feelin' all just the same
Feelin' all like no pain
Goin' on down the drain
Make my own decisions
Just go away
Take the consequences
Just not today
Got enough reasons
Still not workin' for me
Got all the answers
Still so hard to see
Somethin' is confusin' me
Somethin' is abusin' me
Somethin' is refusin' me
Life
Let me live
I wanna give
I've been to hell and back
So many times before
Take me there
I don't care where
And show me why
There's nothing to die for too
Old enough to know better
Too dead to change
Went in with a full deck
Goin' out deranged
I had all the reasons
Tried, it didn't work for me
I had all the answers
I was too blind to see
Mirror man in my eye
Mirror man gonna cry
Mirror man make you die
Let me live
I wanna give
I've been to hell and back
So many times before
Take me there
I don't care where
And show me why
There's nothing to die for tooEmbed
