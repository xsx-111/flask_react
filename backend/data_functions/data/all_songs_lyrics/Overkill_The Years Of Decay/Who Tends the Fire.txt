Who Tends the Fire LyricsWho tends the fire?
Who keeps the torches lit?
Who fill your eyes with smoke
So you can't see?
I need the fire, I need the torches lit
To see through all the smoke
Covering me
I have seen the fire burning
Burning through the night
I have watched the tides a`turning
And they go from dark to light
What is this meaning?
What does this writing mean?
Where do I go?
What do I do for now?
Prophecies are foolish
They never last
They never speak the truth
So why are they calling me now?
I have seen the fire burning
Burning through the night
And I have watched the tides a`turning
And they go from dark to light
I don't know cause I cannot see
All I'm sure is I gotta be
I'm not sure that I'm even me
But I know that I gotta be
You don't know that you're gonna die
Birth, life, death is the reason why
Save those tears that you're gonna cry
Cause I know that you're gonna die
Yes, I know, though I cannot see
And I'm sure that I gotta be
All these voices are killing me
And they say that I got
Say that I got
Say that I gotta be me
Who tends the fire?
Who keeps the torches lit?
Who fill your eyes with smoke
So you can't see?
I need the fire
I need the torches lit to see
I have seen the fires burning
They're burning through the night
I have watched the tide a`turning
Still the fire burning brightEmbed
