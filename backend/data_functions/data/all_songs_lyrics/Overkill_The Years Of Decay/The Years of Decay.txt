The Years of Decay LyricsOut on this road takes its toll
And you pay for everything you do
Under lights, made me blind
This place is the same as last night
Out of control, takes its toll
But you learn to live with your dreams
And speaking your mind
To those you find
Listening to what you have to say
I wouldn't change the way
I wouldn't stop the decay
Promised the world as the world
Changed before our eyes
And the days became the weeks
And the weeks the years
No-one remembers that very first day
How it slipped away
Forever I wait, putting in, putting out
As the motors whine
To remind me I'm home
And I'm here to stay
As we decay
Another day, decay away
I'm going home
I don't know where
I'm going home
Not far from here
Out on this road, paying this toll
Make me whole, set the stage
Fill it with anger, fill it with rage
No, I don't know what is today
I know it falls in the years of decay
Self-sacrifice, every night
And together we paid a price in blood
That spilled out through the years
And another day passes away
Look to the black, drawn farther back
Look to each day, see the decay
Times I've had, good and bad
Win or lose, this is what I choose
The years of decay, the years of decay
The years of decay, the years of decay
The years of decay, the years of decay
The years of decay, the years of decay
Decay away, the years of decay
Decay away, the years of decay
Decay away, the years of decay
Decay away, the years of decayEmbed
