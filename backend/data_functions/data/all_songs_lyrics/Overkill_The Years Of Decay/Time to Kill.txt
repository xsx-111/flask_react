Time to Kill LyricsViolent indecision, surge of mass religion
Let me out of prison
I'm just killing time
Every time I turn around
I start to hear a familiar sound
Counting down as time stands still
Yes I think it's time to kill
Time to kill
Time to kill
Time to kill
Time to kill
All the mental anguish
Speaks a common language
I have yet to lavish
A chance to walk away
Every time I turn around
I start to hear a familiar sound
Counting down as time stands still
Yes I think it's time to kill
Time to kill
Time to kill
Time to kill
Time to kill
Unknowing, unseeing
Revelations unfold before your eyes
Relenting, repenting
No time to think or compromise
Time falling, time calling
Into a void and seal the past
As you're waiting, annihilating
Making it real, making it last!
Worn out compromises
Inside-out demises
See through all the lies
We don't walk away
Every time we turn around
Start to hear that familiar sound
New beginnings, time stands still
Yes I think it's time to kill
Time to kill
Time to kill
Time to kill
Time to kill
Time to killEmbed
