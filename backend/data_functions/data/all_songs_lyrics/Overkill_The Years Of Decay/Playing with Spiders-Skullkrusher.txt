Playing with Spiders/Skullkrusher LyricsStanding at the crossroads
Which way you gonna go?
And what you gonna do
When it come?
Bargaining with gasoline
Take a ride on this machine
Gonna get me some when it come
Just how far you gonna go?
Somebody should let you know
Once you're in, you ain't getting out
Put aside your foolish pride
So you take just one more ride
I don't think you know what it's about
Here it come
Riding on a living Hell
Got another soul to sell
Right is right and wrong is wrong
Life's a dream on this machine
And lasts just about as long
So you think you know it all
And when you're right, you never fall
Well, I got some news for you
Entice you with a wicked smile
Take a ride for a while
Seems that the news is true
Yes, it's true
Take me away
On the ride of your life
Put me away
Death pusher
Take me away
Last time of my life
Skullkrusher
Ten thousand nightmares
Ten thousand years
Ten thousand martyrs crying
Ten million tears
All the thinking never done
All the murder, all the fun
Wash the blood from your hands
Bury your secrets in the sand
And forget
Your mouth gone dry
Shortness of breath
Symptoms of fear
Symptoms of death
Tracks go on for miles
Through the agony and smiles
Laying there in pieces on the ground
What the Hell?
You take a chance
Krusher calls, make your stance
When you're dead
You never make a sound
Racing with the Devil
Engine's slowing down
Fifty years too early
And you're laying on the ground
You're krushed
Take me away
On the ride of my life
Put me away
Death pusher
Take me away
Last time of my life
Put me away
Skullkrusher
Take me away
On the ride of my life
Put me away
Death pusher
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Skullkrusher
Take me away
On the ride of your life
Put me away
Death pusher
Take me away
Last time of my life
Take me away
