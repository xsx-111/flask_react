Elimination LyricsTerminal, what disease?
You told me too late
What's that cough and wheeze
Fatal?
You're shitting me
A second opinion is what I need
Laughing in a windstorm
Blowing all the cornstalks down
Crying in a funeral home
Forward my mail, six feet underground
Elimination, elimination
Elimination, elimination
Contagious, say why not?
Not just me, waiting to rot
Painful, yeah I know
It couldn't be easy when I had to go
I'm yanking on my plug and
I can't seem to get it loose
Pulling all the stops
Your ideals change
When you got nothing to lose
Elimination, elimination
Elimination, elimination
Eliminate the right
Eliminate the wrong
Eliminate the weak
Eliminate the strong
Eliminate your feelings
Eliminate, too late
Eliminate the hope
Eliminate, eliminate
If I had just one more day
I'd turn it all around
I'd make a play of good clean living
And dig me out of the ground
And if I had just one more day
I'd say it to your face
I'll pull the plug on everyone
Eliminate this race
We want to cure and we want to know
Reissue hope, we don't care how
You're making a mess
Diseasing a nation
Runaway train to elimination
Hopeless, there's no doubt
Set on a slow burn from the inside out
Careful, what for?
Last one out closes the coffin door
Spending all you saved
And wishing for a little more
If I'm looking at the ceiling
Then I must be laying on the floor
Elimination, elimination
Elimination, elimination
Terminal, what disease?
You told me too late
What's that cough and wheeze
Fatal?
You're shitting me
A second opinion has gotta be
Laughing at the epidemic
Something is going around
Crying at the epidemic
Pulling all nails, six feet underground
Elimination, elimination
Elimination, elimination
Eliminate the right
Eliminate the wrong
Eliminate the weak
Eliminate the strong
Eliminate your feelings
Eliminate, too late
Eliminate the hope
Eliminate, eliminate
Elimination, elimination
Elimination, elimination
Eliminate the right
Eliminate the wrong
Eliminate the weak
Eliminate the strong
Eliminate your feelings
Eliminate, too late
Eliminate the hope
Eliminate, eliminateEmbed
