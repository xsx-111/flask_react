Evil Never Dies LyricsRevenge is sweet for those who wait
Never early, always late
Waiting now to consummate
A marriage made in Hell
Hand in hand, I walk alone
As good advice seems to drone
Evil cuts right to the bone
Has it come?
Awaken me
Is it done and will it ever die?
Will it go?
Taking me
Don't you know?
Evil Never Dies
Keep me close to your heart
Adversity will come apart
Finish just before you start
Never question why
Today was then, remember when
Skipping numbers one through ten
Permanence through the pen
Has it come?
Awaken me
Is it done, will it ever die?
Will it go?
Taking me
Don't you know?
Evil Never Dies
Read the rights, a prophet's word
I've learnt to deal with the absurd
And reach a darkened pinnacle of light
Money hungry, power thirsty
Penny pinching, fear inflicting
Double crossing, back-stabbing
Promising eternity for a price
Sucking, brain washing
Mind raping, soul stealing
Constant preaching, salvation reaching
Lowest form of human fucking life
Evil Never Dies
Laughter stands accusing me
Emotion stands abusing me
The battered and the bruising me
Is there darkness when you die?
Heard a sound, no-one's there
Heard a shot, no-one cares
Laughter turns into despair
Has it come?
Awaken me
Is it done, will it ever die?
Will it go?
Taking me
Don't you know?
Evil Never Dies
Evil hidden everywhere
Evil has a chilling stare
Null and void of any care's
Where the answer lies
Does no good to bag or cry
Does no good to question why
Does no good, it never dies
Has it come?
Awaken me
Is it done, will it ever die?
Will it go?
Taking me
Don't you know?
Evil Never Dies
Has it come?
Awaken me
Is it done?
Will it go?
Taking me
Don't you know?
