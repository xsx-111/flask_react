Lipslap Lyrics
貯めろ!

Thumb and forefinger tap, laughter
Yeah, you know it
A fingertip placed on the lips which gave a little (shh!)
Maybe we'll talk about that, not now
You see I'm jackin'
All my friends are here, there's just
No time for taboo
Can't believe I have to rap on tracks so you get it
Wanna talk about so much stuff then you just give me hush
We can sort that out for now, the place is packing
Spent big cash on a new dance floor
And everyone's come through

It's all lipslap
Thinking caps
Just lipslap
That is that

I can't hear you cause this beat is taking over
I'm not one to lip-read and you don't come with subtitles
You sure talk the walk into your walkie-talkie
But you can't keep a secret and you never get a word in (Uhh?)
Why don't you keep me in the loop, I like it posted
You stay here and watch an old brick wall get freshly painted
If you didn't catch the facts, I'll repeat them
But to be as smart as me you have to know the slang
Yeah
It's all lipslap
Thinking caps
Just lipslap
That is that

I'll put string through a tin can
Tied up to a goldfish tank
Watch them pass 'round a whisper
Take turns seeing where it lands

It's all lipslap (Get down!)
Thinking caps (What?)
Just lipslap (Be proud!)
That is that
It's all lipslap
Thinking caps
Just lipslap (Yeah)
That is that

I'll put string through a tin can
Tied up to a goldfish tank
Watch them pass 'round a whisper
Take turns seeing where it lands8Embed
