Big City Lyrics
アスファルト、ビル・建物
広がるよ、ネオンライト
町の光がたくさんの星に見える

And it's true
I was kind of lonely at first
So I took life in my own hands
Got a haircut, joined a band
And it turned out alright

I hit the street
Feeling good to be me
Get the look, paint the town
I pick the spot I wanna get down
Some days are tough
When you gotta keep up
But it's all worth the rush
'Cause we stick around anyway

早歩き、で消えて行く
Everybody here's just passing through
The city never sleeps, 今夜もみんなどこに
行くの？
色とりどり
染めておけば
形が
見えてくる
まだ私を知らない
この町、この big city
生まれ変わる
It's a blank canvas made of concrete

Oh, I was kind of lonely at first
So I took life in my own hands
Saw a movie, joined a band
And it turned out alright

I hit the street
Feeling good to be me
Get the look, paint the town
I pick the spot I wanna get down
Some days are tough
When you gotta keep up
But it's all worth the rush
'Cause we stick at it anyway
I hit the street
Feeling good to be me
Get the look, paint the town
I pick the spot I wanna get down
Some days are tough
When you gotta keep up
But it's all worth the rush
That's what I heard someone say…3Embed
