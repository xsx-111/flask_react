Try Me Lyrics
Hey, let's go, I can take it
What do you want to know?
得意なことを
自己アピール
I can appear as and when you need
３６５日
I speak different languages
And people get what I mean
中学生の頃は
I was the best in every class
ブラバン部で
楽器も吹けるよ(ほら!)

But sometimes if I think too hard
I forget that I'm a superstar

Try me!  Try me!
Cause I bet I got what you really need
I'm quick to learn and I can work with people in a team
Try me!  Try me!
Did you know I can do anything?
Just witness this impressive list of my activities:
Business!
Dancing!
Throwing a party...with you!
聞いてほしいの
私のこと
All you guys are the same, oh
Just so predictable
短所は頑固なところ
I like to stick to my principles
いつも前向きに行こうよ
それがモット
I'm gonna make it to the top
夢を叶えたいの
But when I do I can promise I won't stop (yeah right)

Try me!  Try me!
Cause I bet I got what you really need
I'm quick to learn and I can work with people in a team
Try me!  Try me!
Did you know I can do anything?
Just witness this impressive list of my activities

Step by step, 少しずつ
高く高く登る
踊り場に着いたら
休憩タイムで一休み
Think about where I'm going to go
階段登れば登るほど
景色がきれいになってゆく
終わりには何が待っている？
But sometimes if I think too hard
I forget that I'm a superstar

Try me!  Try me!
Cause I bet I've got what you really need
I'm quick to learn and I can work with people in a team
Try me!  Try me!
Did you know I can do anything?
Just witness this impressive list of my activities
Try me!  Try me!
Cause I bet I've got what you really need
I'm quick to learn and I can work with people in a team
Try me!  Try me!
Did you know I can do anything?
I'm seeking a position in a fine society
Try me!6Embed
