Graduation Lyrics
Today's my graduation, I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw
Today's my graduation, so long to education
Didn't learn a thing anyway

These are the best days of our lives
That's what the grown ups told us, right?
Tapping my pencil, waiting for the bell
Thinking what to say in my last farewell
Hey teacher, leave those kids alone!
さいごのチャイムがなてるよ
And everyone's happy, but 行きたくない
What shall I do now the world is mine?

Today's my graduation, I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw (but I'm not going)
Today's my graduation, so long to education
Didn't learn a thing anyway

窓の外ばかり見てた
まるとばつだけだった
そんな世界にさようなら
一人卒業式 say
先生、みんな、さようなら
先生、みんな、さようなら
先生、みんな、さようなら
耳の中で卒業
Today's my graduation, I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw
I'd like to thank my pets, my friends, my family
I didn't learn a thing anyway
What you wanna be?
There's so much you can do with a degree
Now I can apply for a PhD
Get a nice job with a high salary
Chasing after １００点、満点
全部できたくない、もうだめ
鳥かごの扉を開けて
空に向かって羽ばたいて

Today's my graduation, I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw (but I'm not going)
Today's my graduation, so long to education
Didn't learn a thing anyway

(But I'm not going)
(But I'm not going)
(But I'm not going)
(But I'm not going today)10Embed
