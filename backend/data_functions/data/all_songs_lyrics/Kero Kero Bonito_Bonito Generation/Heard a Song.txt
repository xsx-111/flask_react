Heard a Song Lyrics
I just put the radio on
Heard a song, I can't stop thinking about it
Though it didn't last very long
It's in my head
Plus I didn't catch who it was
But it sort of sounded like a big hit
Are you gonna play it some more?
Guess I'll keep on listening

Cruising along in my new car
Top down, round the block, not too fast
All I need is bass on the stereo
So I turn it up and it goes like
"Oh-oh-oh-oh," it's a beat so sweet
That I stop in the middle of the street
Then a kid runs up and he says
"I don't know you but that sounds fresh"

When I need a hand, no matter where I am
I pick up the vibrations
Where the music plays, all the time every day
Now I'm stuck on rotation
I just put the radio on
Heard a song, I can't stop thinking about it
Though it didn't last very long
It's in my head
Plus I didn't catch who it was
But it sort of sounded like a big hit
Are you gonna play it some more?
Guess I'll keep on listening

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like this

I get back to my dominion
And ask my friends their opinion
I heard this song on the radio
Sounds cool, Sarah, how did it go?
Like "oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh?"
I don't know
Hm, well, if nobody can help me
Did I imagine this melody?
When I need a hand, no matter where I am
I pick up the vibrations
Where the music plays, all the time every day
Now I'm stuck on rotation

I just put the radio on
Heard a song, I can't stop thinking about it
Though it didn't last very long
It's in my head
Plus I didn't catch who it was
But it sort of sounded like a big hit
Are you gonna play it some more?
Guess I'll keep on listening

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like this
I think it went something kind of like this
I think it went something kind of like4Embed
