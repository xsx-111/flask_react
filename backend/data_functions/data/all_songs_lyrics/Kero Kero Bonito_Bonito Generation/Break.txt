Break Lyrics
I know it seems kinda tough
But really it's easy enough
For us to slow down the pace
So we can all go take a break
In fact, there’s not much better than nothing at all
And that's especially true when there is something to do

目の前を
ぐるぐる世界が駆け抜ける
でも私は daydream 夢見てる
Look out the window 窓の外
Watching the world go by, goodbye
みんなどこかへ向かってる
でもかみが dancing in the wind
こういう時に思うんだ
生きていて本当によかった
幸せ気分になれるんだ
これでいい気がするんだ
I got a smile on my face
Cause now I'm taking a break

何もしないこの時間
今っていうこの瞬間
ペースにブレーキかけて
Let's slow down
I know it seems kinda tough
But really it's easy enough
For us to slow down the pace
So we can all go take a break
In fact, there's not much better than nothing at all
And that's especially true
When there is something to do

Just move very slowly to the beat (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
Now get down and put up your feet (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
If you like to lounge, relax, or flop (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
Doesn't really matter when you're doing squat
(a-yo, a-a-yo-o)

空を見上げる満月
星ってこんなに綺麗なんだ
こういう時に思うんだ
生きてるって不思議
Life is a race, that's what they say
So time out, and look around
立ち止まると見えてくる
I see it now
(Take a break!)
"Hey, you've reached Gus and Jamie from KKB
We're recording right now
So leave your message after the beep"
Yo, Gus and Jamie, it's Sarah
Just to let you know that I don't wanna do anything today
So I'll see you later, bye!

I know it seems kinda tough
But really it's easy enough
For us to slow down the pace
So we could all go take a break
In fact, there's not much better than nothing at all
And that's especially true
When there is something to do

Just move very slowly to the beat (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
Now get down and put up your feet (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
If you like to lounge, relax, or flop (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
Doesn't really matter when you're doing squat (a-yo, a-yo)2Embed
