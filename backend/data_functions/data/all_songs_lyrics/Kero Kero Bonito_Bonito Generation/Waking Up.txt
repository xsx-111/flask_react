Waking Up Lyrics
What's that?
Wanna go back to sleep

When I hear that alarm clock ring (Wake up)
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my forty winks (All done)
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze
Because waking up is the hardest part (Uh-huh)
But then, it's essential

Get up, get up, what's that in the sky?
Could it be? It's KKB
パワーアップして戻ってきたぜ
無敵のヒーロ、それがボニト
Rise and shine, it's party time
Eat your breakfast, and you'll be fine
Everybody, エンジンスタート
ケロケロワールドへご招待

苦手な早起き
でもわいてくるよ、やる気
始まる一日
波に乗りたい (Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo)
Back in the place, I'm looking great
Bet you can't tell I'm half awake
Living my way, no day is the same
But sometimes I'm a bit late
When I hear that alarm clock ring (Wake up)
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my forty winks (All done)
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze
Because waking up is the hardest part (Uh-huh)
But then, it's essential

Three, two, one, lift-off, infinity
Let's go on a Kero Kero journey
Get on the bus and hold on tight
スピードマックス going so high
世界のみんなへ届ける
International 楽しい sound
僕たち３人ビートにのせて
But then I wonder, is it all a dream?

Whoa

When I hear that alarm clock ring
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my forty winks
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze
Because waking up is the hardest part
But then, it's essential
When I hear that alarm clock ring (Wake up)
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my forty winks (All done)
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze
Because waking up is the hardest part (Uh-huh)
But then, it's essential8Embed
