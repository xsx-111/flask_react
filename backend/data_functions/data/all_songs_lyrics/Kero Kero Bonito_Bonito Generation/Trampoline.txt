Trampoline Lyrics
As the rain came down my window
I heard the wind blow all around
I was stuck under the weather
Felt like forever
Out of the sun
But then I looked at my garden
And saw at the bottom my old trampoline
That's when I knew what to do
I could break right on through, yeah
The clouds aren't so high

First you fall down
Then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy
Anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready
Mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip
Just set your body free
Life looks better
When you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity
And don't forget to
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce
Bounce

Though I love it when I'm floating
It's kinda lonely at the top
But if we all jump together
Then we'll go higher
We'll never stop
I know I gotta come down
Put my feet on the ground soon
But that's okay
You see, I'm safe in the knowledge
No matter what, I got my old trampoline

First you fall down
Then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy
Anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready
Mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip
Just set your body free
Life looks better
When you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity
And don't forget to bounce
つまずいて
落ちてくことってあるけど
どん底の　底の底って
何があるか　知ってる？
どんどん落ちていくと
Trampoline があるんだよ
突き落とされても大丈夫
手をあげて　飛び上がれ

Even if you're falling
That's okay
There's a trampoline waiting for you
It's so easy
You just have to believe
信じればいいんだよ

So jump, jump, trampoline
Fly to where you want to be
Jump, jump, trampoline
Fly to where you want to be
Jump, jump, trampoline
Fly to where you want to be
Jump, jump, trampoline
Fly to where you want
First you fall down
Then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy
Anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready
Mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip
Just set your body free
Life looks better
When you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity
And don't forget to bounce
Don't forget to bounce20Embed
