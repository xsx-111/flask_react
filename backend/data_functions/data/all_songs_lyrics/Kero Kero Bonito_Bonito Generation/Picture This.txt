Picture This Lyrics
Hold your camera high and click
Exercise your right to picture this
But don't forget to show
Everybody you've ever known
When you're old and wise you'll find
All the shots you've got
Bring back the time, it's easy to believe
Yesterday was so sweet

It's pretty great, photos let me take
All the sights I see, food I eat
Everywhere with me
Though they're 2D, pics are all I need
To show everyone what I've done
Who I want to be

I check that no one else is around
And I take a picture of myself

Hold your camera high and click
Exercise your right to picture this
But don't forget to show
Everybody you've ever known
When you're old and wise you'll find
All the shots you've got
Bring back the time, it's easy to believe
Yesterday was so sweet
すぎていく毎日だけど楽しい時間えいえんにかえよ
忘れないこの瞬間写真の中でいきてるよ
And I really couldn't say why my life is so photographic
Cause these days it's just automatic
Show me a pic or it didn't even happen
みんなでならんで笑って Peace
放課後のプリクラ
しゃめとってじどりして
おくってかえしてとうこうして
So picture this

I check that no one else is around
And I take a picture of myself

Hold your camera high and click
Exercise your right to picture this
But don't forget to show
Everybody you've ever known
When you're old and wise you'll find
All the shots you've got
Bring back the time, it's easy to believe
Yesterday was so sweet
Hold your camera high and click
Exercise your right to picture this
But don't forget to show
Everybody you've ever known
When you're old and wise you'll find
All the shots you've got
Bring back the time, it's easy to believe
Yesterday was so sweet
Yesterday was so sweet
Yesterday was so sweet
Yesterday was so sweet
Yesterday was so sweet
Yesterday was so sweet
Yesterday was so sweet
Yesterday was so sweet
Yesterday was so sweet8Embed
