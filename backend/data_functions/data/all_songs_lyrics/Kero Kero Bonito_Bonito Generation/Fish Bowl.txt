Fish Bowl Lyrics
Small fish stuck in a fish bowl
Do you pine for the sea?
Watching life all around you
Are you looking at me?

Swim around in a circle
Come along when it's feeding time
You're the king of the castle
Who likes to hide (Whoa)
But when you find the ocean
How will you know where to go?

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, oh, oh, yeah

小さい場所だけど
幸せそう
When I see you tomorrow
Will you remember this song?
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, oh, oh, yeah3Embed
