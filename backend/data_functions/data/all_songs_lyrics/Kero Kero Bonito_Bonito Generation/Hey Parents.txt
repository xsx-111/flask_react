Hey Parents Lyrics
No matter what you do, there's something everyone shares
We all inherit ourselves from a pair
And if you never met them all, you call them your friends
One thing is certain, the tree never ends

And though it's been a while since I first saw them
I still say

Hey, mum, how are you today?
Are you missing me a lot?
Yes, I'm sticking to my bedtime
And I'm keeping very warm, so
Hey, dad, don't you worry now
Cause I got it all worked out
But don't tell me "did you keep my room?"
Cause I'm coming over soon

I sure don't know if making me was part of the plan
But that's what happened, and I'm cool with that
But now I'm here, I better go find something to do
Something I want to, so they can relax
私の前には、 ママとパパ
そのまた前には grandma, grandpa
もっと前に、their mum and dad
Am I next?

Hey, mum, how are you today?
Are you missing me a lot?
Yes, I'm sticking to my bedtime
And I'm keeping very warm, so
Hey, dad, don't you worry now
Cause I got it all worked out
But don't tell me "did you keep my room?"
Cause I'm coming over soon

Will I find my life
Has happened all before?
Sometimes I realize
Time's running out and I don't know why
ずっと子供でいたいのに

Hey, mum, how are you today?
Are you missing me a lot?
Yes, I'm sticking to my bedtime
And I'm keeping very warm, so
Hey, dad, don't you worry now
Cause I got it all worked out
But don't tell me "did you keep my room?"
Cause I'm coming over soon
Cause I'm coming over soon
Cause I'm coming over soon8Embed
