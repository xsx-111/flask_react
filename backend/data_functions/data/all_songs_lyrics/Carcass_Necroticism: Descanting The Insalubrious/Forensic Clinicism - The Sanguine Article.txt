Forensic Clinicism / The Sanguine Article LyricsSalutiferous exaltation, through fusty spatterings I sift
Cauterizing proud flesh, pyogenic cortex I just yearn to rip
With impalpable, cathartic tools, dilapidated lusts I gratify
Cold premediated surgery, in my calculated surgery I hold your fragile life
Pultacious
Pugnacious
Pernicious
Acro-idiopathic
Artificially concussed, excavating to your gastric core
Patulous, deep wounds, cascading and crimson as I explore
Master at my bloody art, I like to carve sculpture and maim
Mounted on the freezer's geurney, you're exhibited until you enter into decay
Pultacious
Pugnacious
Delicious
Gastric-idiopathology
Welcome to my theatre, the stage upon which I act
Turning into a sumptuous perfomance, heiniously I hew and gash
Churning out a deep gulch, the incision a major nick
A quick toke of nitrous oxide is how I get my kicks
Expurgating healthy tissue, opulent flesh I slit
Costate cuts expunged as the patient I now fillet
Malpractising and mussing, carnage hyperventilates
Self placebonic, the only cure is to operate
The recumbent are my prey – under my genital blade
Your precordium I brutally plunder – whilst you're put under
Exsanguinating – you're totally parched
Exenterating – removing body parts
Wholly abraded – Surgically maimed
Decortication – Medically slain
Contaminating, infacting, how I love to cough and sneeze
On the carneous culture, to cause bacteria to breed
Anaesthetised, paralysed, a clinical stupor is induced
With callous dexterity your bodily mass is reduced
I extract the gullet – to end up in my bucket
A quick flick of my wrist – and I'll be struck off the list
Exsanguinating – straight from the heart
Exenterating – with my lancet so sharp
Anatomically – my surgery maims
Decortication – by the clinically deranged
Gross misconduct, I make the choicest cuts
Text book stabs, written on your tag
Wheeled away after a medical mishap
In a polythene bag your body is now wrapped
The acute wound now sealed up
The picture of ill-health, you're a bit cut upEmbed
