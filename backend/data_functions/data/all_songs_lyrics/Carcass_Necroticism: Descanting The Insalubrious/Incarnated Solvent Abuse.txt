Incarnated Solvent Abuse Lyrics"If visible identification is not possible, the pathologist may be able to take fingerprints from the body until decay sets in... things become more complicated."
Intenacious, intersecting
Reaving fats from corporal griskin
Culled... for sodden gelatine brayed
Skeletal groats triturated, desinently
Exsiccated, sere glutenate brewed
For frivolous solvent abuse
Derogate coarse remains
For glue to dry
Despoiled marrow razed
A truculent shambles so severe
Extravasated bone—as adhesive incarnate
A pellucid quietus—nocuosly I create
Corporal glue, breathe in the fumes
Mucilage vapours, toxic fumes to savour
Comminuted remains
As gum to dry
A lissom gel so glazed
A truculent shambolic affair
The exsanguine esprit—snorted as snuff
Rheumic oils forever—Bonded together as gum
Human glue, choke on the fumes
Noxious vapours, slaughterous labour1Embed
