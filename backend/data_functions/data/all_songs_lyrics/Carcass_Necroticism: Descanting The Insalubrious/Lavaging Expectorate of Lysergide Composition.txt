Lavaging Expectorate of Lysergide Composition LyricsOfficinal â€” immiscible compounds are mixed
A gagging expectorate, of lysergic acids
Premensely emerced, consciousness slowly sips
Peculated, in an ebriating narcocis
Cataleptic
Imbibe
Neurotripsick
Neurally numbed, a narcosis so trans-lucid
So pernicious, halluciagenics
Procreating, ocular contorting
Your idiosyncrassy, is now expropriated
Extirpation
Mind
