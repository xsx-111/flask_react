Corporal Jigsore Quandary Lyrics"Identifying the bodies which are decomposed, dismembered, skeletonised pose very serious problems. We've had many cases in this department where a body has been found in pieces, or decomposed, and we've been able to put things together. Yes, the head, the upper part of the body, in a very badly decomposed state..."
Excised and anatomised, deviscerated disarray
The torso diverged with pride
Deftly amputated, evulsed limbs now defunct
The trunk imbrued, tatty stumps used as lugs
For a chondrin puzzle so quaint
Head and body decollate
A heaving mass so quiescent
Scattered and scrambled, your teasement grows
A bloody caricature to make whole
A squirming grisly jigsaw, detrital fragments fit so snug
That missing piece will leave you stumped
Totally desassembled, nicely sliced and diced
A cold mannequin once resembled
Real cranium teaser, carved from flesh and bone
So mystifying
Battered and diffused, with placating blows
A human jigsaw to make whole
A sequacious pattern which once fitted so snug
Joining together each dubious lump
Ravaged disassembly, neatly cubed and diced
A cold mannequin reassembled
Astute brain teaser, incorporate flesh and bone
So mortifying
An incessant game -- methodically made
With each cumulative piecing - of commensated meat
Bi-manual reconstruction, eldritch problem complete
A convented effigy
A pathological toy, each chunk rigorously
Inter mortis locking, as you pathogenically rot
Such a perplexing task
To fit the remains in the casket
Uliginous mess so quiescent
An incessant game - methodically made
With each cumulative piece - of commensated meatEmbed
