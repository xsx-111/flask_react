Indirect Enquiries LyricsYou gained respect as we passed
Not a wave, a gestured wink
I was forced to think
I couldn't ignore
I've seen you before
Joking aside, face to face
It's the one I cannot place
A hint might enlarge your imprint
I think I've had a taste of
A savoury, denial would be a waste
Lying prone
Hiding in a column, between SALE and ZDRK
Sky, sand, and moorland, shepherd's delight
Not in the sun, which stops you from walking
I might find you
But I lack the patience
Passed a corner, you'd been stolen
Ate a meal, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defaced, you'd been defaced
You'd been defacedEmbed
