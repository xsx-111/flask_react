Two People in a Room LyricsTwo people in a room
Facial movements betray
(A private display)
(Of nervous disorder)
And mutual torture
Two people in a room
(Bloody image is conjured)
(But no one is injured)
The weapons are chosen
But the action is frozen
Two people in a room
Positions are shifted
The ceasefire unlifted
The lighting is fierce
It's intended to pierce
Any cloak of deceit
And encourage retreat
And God, they're so gifted
My God, they're so gifted
My God, they're so gifted
Two people in a room
A personal locations
(An indication)
(Of previous decisions)
Aggressive decisionsEmbed
