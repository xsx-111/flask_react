Blessed State LyricsClosing doors opens eyes
To the fatal gift of a well timed lie
Loved in the flesh, but butchered in the mind
Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world
Closing doors opens eyes
To the fatal gift of a well timed lie
Loved in the flesh, but butchered in the mind
Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world
Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world
Holy globe, eternal home
Sacred sphere, so glad I'm here
Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world
Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world
(Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world)
(Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world)
(Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world)
(Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world)
(Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world)2Embed
