40 Versions LyricsI never know which version I'm going to be
I seem to have so many choices open to me
It's not hard to see another unique event
When you miss the beginning and you miss the end
I've got forty versions all dying to get the part
And so with a change of mind comes a change of heart
A total eclipse arrives now and Niagara Falls
No loss of life yet and no further calls
I never know which version I'm going to be
I get the feeling my mind is deceiving me
Where only edges can be seen of the spaces
In between are where only edges can be seen of the spaces
In between are where only edges can be seen of the spaces
In between are where only edges can be seen of the spaces3Embed
