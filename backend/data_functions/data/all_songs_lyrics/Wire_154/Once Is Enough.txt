Once Is Enough LyricsIt's sinister
I'd attempt a casual structure preceding interaction
Symphonic in persuasion, noblesse oblige
Each minister
Is just a drop compared with having double vision
It's desirable in part, refuse the ruse
Deciding each devise if you don't think twice
Once is enough, once is enough
Preparing its demise, it's something you'll devise
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
In passing
You sprang a leak instead (You'd sooner see its piety)
(You'd replied in its course before you)
Resume transmission
Deciding each devise if you don't think twice
Once is enough, once is enough
Preparing its demise, it's something you'll devise
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
You retiring
I'll respond with curtained thought, a pause for intermission
My advice is simple
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enoughEmbed
