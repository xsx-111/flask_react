Single K.O. LyricsI've found something
No one else is looking for
I've found something
That there's no use for
And what's more
I'm keeping it to myself
I'm leaning over backwards
Shoulders pressed to the floor
I'm leaning over backwards
Shoulders pressed to the door
Two falls or one submission
Or a single K.O
Two falls or one submission
Or a single K.O
But what's one submission
Amongst, amongst friends?Embed
