The 15th LyricsReviewed, it seems
As if someone were watching over it
Before it was
As if response were based on fact
Providing, deciding
It was soon there
Squared to it, faced to it
It was not there
Renewed, it fought
As if it had a cause to live for
Denied, it learned
As if it had sooner been destroyed
Providing, deciding
It was soon there
Squared to it, faced to it
It was not there
Reviewed, it fought, as if someone were watching over it
Before it had sooner been denied
Renewed, it seemed as if it had a cause to live for
Destroyed, it was later based on fact
Providing, deciding
It was soon there
Squared to it, faced to it
It was not there2Embed
