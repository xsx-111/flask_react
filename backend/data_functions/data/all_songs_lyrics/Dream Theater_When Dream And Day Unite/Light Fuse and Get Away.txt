Light Fuse and Get Away Lyrics
Would you like to sit and talk to me
About the way things change so suddenly
When your senses come and the feeling goes?
Can you remember feeling much too close?
Stop your hands from shaking, look at me
Are your senses racing endlessly
Tracing past impressions? So were mine
Have you ever been used or will this be the first time?

It's come so clear to me
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain, it's a fatal game
And the true lose everything
I can see what trust and loyalty have done for me
Falling miles from the mark
With a thirst for revenge and a dangerous heart

I've tried to wash from memory
Feelings of betrayal and the incidents
That plague me since I lost my sense of innocence
A history of changes now I'm loving
Now I'm losing keeps me constantly
In fear of hearing "I can't see where this is going"
You lie alone with the memory
Feeling the ceiling and walls closing in on
Your conscience - my ally
The guilt - your affliction
From preying on praise as you fed an attention addiction
Someone told me
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
And when it's lust to dust you can crawl from the wreckage
I can see what trust and loyalty have done for me
Lying bleeding in the dark
With a thirst for revenge and a dangerous heart

It's come so clear to me
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
It's a fatal game and the true lose everything
I can see what trust and loyalty have done for me
Falling miles from the mark
With a thirst for revenge and a dangerous heart

Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
And when it's lust to dust you can crawl from the wreckage
I can see what trust and loyalty have done for me
Lying bleeding in the dark
With a thirst for revenge and a dangerous heartEmbed
