Status Seeker Lyrics
Heart sick at the sight of the status seeker
In a sense I'm not beyond reproach
The aspiration to drop a name when any rose might smell the same
Maybe you'll figure it out someday
I want to know you now, you know I've always believed in you

Nothing is sacred, you draw the bottom line with a dollar sign
Change of opinion at the drop of a dime
Graceless intrusion, are you sanctified in your judgment of me?
All that I deserve is what you were unable to see

In a garden where the seeds were spilled
I favored the few that stood strong in the sun
As I reached for the profit of my prize
I found I had trampled the forgotten ones

Nothing is sacred, you draw the bottom line with a dollar sign
Change of opinion at the drop of a dime
Graceless intrusion, are you sanctified in your judgment of me?
All that I deserve is what you were unable to see

You're running in circles and I'm turning away
You refused to believe, now I'm turning away
Nothing is sacred, you draw the bottom line with a dollar sign
Change of opinion at the drop of a dime
Graceless intrusion, are you sanctified in your judgment of me?
All that I deserve is what you were unable to see

You're running in circles and I'm turning away
You refused to believe, now I'm turning awayEmbed
