The Ones Who Help to Set the Sun Lyrics
Watching my window I was led like a child
As the roadway lamplights misguided my mind through the night
A shadow of limits, we were racing the rain
My hands held the wheel, my eyes tried to hold their place
There must have been a time when I thought that you were watching
It had to be when my senses lost control
I thought I'd slipped away, I thought I could still feel us moving
It must have been a cloud no bigger than a man's hand
Every reason I risk my life to come back to you
Is locked behind your door, you're my immunity
Outside I watched you burn, heavy hearts were bleeding
A cry for help, a familiar voice my melting hands streaked the glass
As I walked away, I wondered what had really happened
Had I run out of time, did I push myself too far
As my last step fell, I felt my hands upon the wheel
Had I come back to life, or did I ever leave at all

In higher lives we seem to be always a moment too late
We're past the time, when we looked on
Now we're the one who help to set the sun

This time for real I locked the door behind me
My mind was still a wreck from what I saw
For when my hands are still, I'll recognize the message
Never again will my senses lose control
In higher lives we seem to be always a moment too late
We're past the time, when we looked on
Now we're the one who help to set the sunEmbed
