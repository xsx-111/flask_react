Only a Matter of Time Lyrics
A suited man smiled, said: It's just a matter of time
You can have the world at your feet by tomorrow
Just sign on this line
Hold tight, limelight!
Approaching the paramount with the sun in our eyes
Fearing family ties, legalies compromise
In a dimly lit room with a stool as his stage
A dream-stricken prince of a pauper's descent
Haunts the eavesdropping silence that presses his window
As he sweats a performance to an audience that ticks on the wall
To the practical observer it's just a matter of time
You can deviate from the commonplace only to fall back in line
I understand mine's a risky plan and your system can't miss
But is security after all a cause or symptom of happiness?
Brave, yet afraid, his eyes on horizon
In a steady-set gaze
A mariner soon from an open cocoon
Takes a moment to summon his courage
To stifle his grave apprehension and trembling, approaches the surf
A father's benediction as his hopeful son departs
To brave the sea of rage and conquer at all costs
Lingers in his memory and visions still surviving in a logic-proof shell
That should have been held sacred, safe and hidden well
Are compromised in usury
With every rising sun that yields no sight of land
The hesitation cultivates within the tired man
And rumors spread of mutiny
And though the time will come when dream and day unite
Tonight the only consolation causing him to fight
Is fearless faith in destiny
Even when plans fall to pieces
I can still find the courage with promise I've found in my faith

Likely or not, it's a dream that we keep and at odds with our senses we'll climb
But if faith is the answer, we've already reached it
And if spirit's a sign, then it's only a matter of time
Only a matter of timeEmbed
