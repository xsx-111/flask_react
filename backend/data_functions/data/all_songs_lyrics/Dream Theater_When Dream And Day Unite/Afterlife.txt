Afterlife Lyrics
I touched with one who made me run
Away from my own soul
In this world with its many illusions
We are moving like mice through a maze

And now I find what's left behind
Has served to make me whole
Full of doubt, deception, and delusion
Seeking purpose to all earthly days
I search within beneath a skin
That bears both pleasure and pain
In a world full of constant confusion
I will not be a par to the craze

In the afterlife will dark be bright?
Will cold be warm?
Will the day have no night?
In the afterlife will the blind have sight?
In the afterlife

Behind closed eyes some comfort lies
In knowing the truth never spoken
Through this world with us, hidden conclusion
We'll keep moving like mice through a maze
In the afterlife will dark be bright?
Will cold be warm?
Will the day have no night?
In the afterlife will the blind have sight?
In the afterlife


In the afterlife will dark be bright?
Will cold be warm?
Will the day have no night?
In the afterlife will the blind have sight?
In the afterlifeEmbed
