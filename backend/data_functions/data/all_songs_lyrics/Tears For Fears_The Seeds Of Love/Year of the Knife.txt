Year of the Knife Lyrics
Hallelujah, the king is dead
He said, "Love was the knife"
And now he'll dream
Some magic queen might try and save his life
They say his famous final words
Came from the heart of the man
He made his bed on love denied
He played Jeckyll and Hyde till the day he died

Too late for the young gun
To lead a simple life
Too late for the young gun

This is...
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife

See the mountains crumble
Feel the fire go cold
Summer will turn to winter
Love will turn to stone

They say his famous final words
Came from the heart of man
I made his bed on love denied
Now I ain't gonna sleep tonight

Too late for the young gun
To lead a simple life
Too late for the young gun

The sun and the moon
The sun and the moon
The wind... and the rain


This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
This is the year of the knife
Too late, much too late
Too late for the young gun

This is the year of the knifeEmbed
