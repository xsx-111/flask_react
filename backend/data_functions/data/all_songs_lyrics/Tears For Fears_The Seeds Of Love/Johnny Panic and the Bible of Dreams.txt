Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams Lyrics
I can't guarantee that
I can't guarantee that
I can't guarantee that

Johnny Panic
Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams

I get excited by the news of today
What seems unstable may be able to stay
Johnny Panic
Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams

My flame is heart, my baby do as she please
What good is living, when you live in disease
Johnny Panic
Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams

I dream of heaven, it's a heavenly place
Why fall in love when you can fall from grace
With Johnny Panic?
Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams
High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man
And the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
D.J.'s the man we love the most
Could you be, could you be squeaky clean
And smash any hope of democracy?
As the headline says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues

I can't guarantee that
I can't guarantee that

I spy tears in their eyes
They look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste
So nice to eat, so nice to taste
Politician granny with your high ideals
Have you no idea how the majority feels?
So without love and a promised land
We're fools to the rules of a government plan
Kick out the style, bring back the jam
And bring back the jam
I can't guarantee that
I can't guarantee that
I can't guarantee that
I can't guarantee that
I can't guarantee that
I can't guarantee thatEmbed
