Standing on the Corner of the Third World Lyrics
Man, I never slept so hard
I never dreamt so well
Dreaming I was safe in life
Like mussels in a shell
Rolling and controlling
All the basements and the back roads of our lives

Fill their dreams with big fast cars
Fill their heads with sand
Holy white we'll paint the town
The colour of our flag
Hey there little lady has your baby got the look of some old man?
Standing on the corner of the third world

Hungry men will close their minds
Ideas are not their food
Notions fall on stony ground
Where passions are subdued
Colour all the madness for the madness is the thorn that's in our side
Standing on the corner of the third world

Of the third world, of the third world
Of the third world, of the third world
Of the third world, of the third world
When we gonna learn?
Who we gonna turn to?
The promises they make
The call for our attention
Compassion is the fashion
Free to earn, our pockets burn
We buy for love
Die for love


Hold me, I'm crying
Hold me, I'm dyingEmbed
