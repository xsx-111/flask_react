Swords and Knives Lyrics
A waking world of innocence
So grave those first born cries
When life begins with needles and pins
It ends with swords and knives

Oh dangerman, oh dangerman
Your blade fits like a glove
When forged in steel time cannot heal
That blood red bond of love

In times of trouble you're an open book
With the change in the way you look
And it's sad love's not enough to make things better


Turn the tables, we'll burn the fables
Lies beneath the visions and daydreams
Fooled by now, we mystify the past
Like a dream, like it never happened

When life begins with needles and pins
It ends with swords and knives
God save those born to dieEmbed
