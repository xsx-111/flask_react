Ex-Dreams LyricsSo keep calling as I play it 4th Street
I lick the wounds from his open gunshot
The model opens in a red balloon
She's selling the city everything she's got
I want myself wanna be more like them
I wonder we're feeling all the time
I make spit shit jealous for me
But no one cares when I hit the ground
So keep cause on 34th street
I lick the wounds from his open gunshot
She's flashing the city everything she's got
I like myself wanna be more like her
I wonder who picks up all the town
I make shit space jealous crashing
But no one cares when I hit the groundEmbed
