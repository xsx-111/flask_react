Candy LyricsI just quit my job
Now I can stay out all night long
Where my mind is tomorrow
Don't matter 'til the dawn
Can go to a million place
Can sing a thousand songs
Until my mind is made up
I'll be really really gone
When was the last time
You were able to take a breath?
To not give in, be sore and sin
Or to be a nervous wreck
I've been to the darkest places
I've been a total mess
I picked up what I could
And I laughed off all the rest
When I hear the radio play
I don't care that it's not me
Remember the days I'd shout anything
For you to see me
I could never sing now my voice
Is free
Now my voice is...
I just quit my job
Now I can stay out all night long
Where my mind is tomorrow
Don't matter 'til the dawn
Can go to a million place
I can sing a thousand songs
Until my mind is made up
I'll be really really gone
When I hear the radio play
I don't care that it's not me
I remember the days I'd shout anything
For you to see me
I could never sing now my voice
Is free
Now my voice is...Embed
