Animal LyricsRight, two, one, two three
Oooooh All of the animals He's an animal
Out of your front door
Bite my skin
Watch me drink
I am the animal He's an animal
I want a drink
I want what you've got
Give it to me
It's not wrong
That I want it all
YEAH He's an animal
He's an animal
Wrap your hands around my butt
Rub your nails down my butt
I wanna feel it all
I wanna feel it all
It's not wrong
That you want it all
Oooooh He's an animal
He's an animal
Animal
Animal
He's an animal
He's an animal
Animal
Bite my skin
I want everything
Give it to me
It's not wrong
That I want it all
Whatever I want
That means one and allEmbed
