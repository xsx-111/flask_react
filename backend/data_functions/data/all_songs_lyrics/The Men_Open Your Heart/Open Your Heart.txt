Open Your Heart LyricsOpen your heart to me
I'm lost I'm found
I'm tugging at your sleeve
There are no mirrors here
Do what you want be who you want to be
I've been riding
What the night pulls in
Even if she says, "no"
I won't let go
Open your heart to me
Don't believe the tricks
That is tangling my sleeve
There are no mirrors here
I am who I am
I'm in for you to see
I've been riding
What the night pulls in
Even if she says, "no"
I won't let go
Open your heart to me
I'm lost I'm found
I'm tugging at your sleeve
There are no mirrors here
Do what you want be who you want to be
I've been riding
What the night pulls in
Even if she says, "no"
I won't let goEmbed
