Country Song LyricsSome of us are born to lead
Some of us are born to breed
And some of us are born to sing love songs
Some of us are born to win
Some of us are born to sin
And some of us are good old country boys
Chorus:
So when you're feeling blue, here's what I'll do for
You
I'll pick up my guitar and start to play
And when I've made my choice I will raise my voice
And sing you a good old country love song
I'll sing a song of divorce
Or tell of lack of intercourse
Starving kids and tramps along the road
I'll sing about the gamblin' man
And God will save him if he can
Just prove his dominoes a bible
Chorus
Mama used to sing me a fine country tune
As my dinner was a stewin'
Yeah my Ma did everything for me
I thank the Lord above
He gave me life and he gave me love
Chorus
I'll tell you of my prison years
If I can just hold back the tears
Thinking of the bad things that I done
But I can't help a little smile
When I recall that sweet little child
Waiting at the gates when they released me
Chorus
Now she's waiting home hummin' a fine country tune
As my dinner is a stewin'
Yeah that girl does everything for me
I thank the Lord above
He gave me hope and he gave me love
Chorus
Well I don't care about s** or race
So long as you stay in your place
I'll find room for you in my song
I glamourise war and death
I epitomize self righteousness
And I'll never do my country wrong
