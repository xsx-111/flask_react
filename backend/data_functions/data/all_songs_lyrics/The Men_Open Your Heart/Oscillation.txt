Oscillation Lyrics...and to take the fall
And to take the feeling
I'd really like to be informed of what's next
I'd like to be informed of what you have in store
And to take the fall
And to take the feeling
I'd really like to be informed of what's next
I wanna know what's in store
I'd like to call you to the stand
I just have a couple of things I'd like to ask
I'd like to call you to the stand
I just have a couple of things that I'd like to ask
Please take the stand
Please take the stand
And to take the fallEmbed
