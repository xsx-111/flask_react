Turn It Around LyricsOh baby girl, gonna find you
I wanna see you go down
I wanna see you when you jump so high
I wanna see you when you turn it around
I wanna see you write a love song
I wanna see you go down
I wanna see you when you jump so high
I wanna see you when you turn it around
I wanna see you when you jump dive
I wanna see you go down
I wanna see you when you look so fine
I wanna see you when you turn it around
I wanna see you write a love song
I wanna see you go down
I wanna see you when you jump so high
I wanna see you when you turn it around
Oh baby girl, gonna find you
I wanted you to go down
I wanna see you when you jump so high
I wanna see you when you turn it around
I wanna see you write a love song
I wanna see you go down
I wanna see you when you look so fine
I wanna see you when you turn it aroundEmbed
