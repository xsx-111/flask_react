Fear Lyrics
I smell the fear that rains inside
The thought of children who must oblige
To tainted dreams and polluted seas
The missing moon and melting trees
A mist of doom and clouds of pain
A toxic waste and an acid rain
The passing of our ignorance
A lifetime spent in abstinence

I'm living in fear, I'm living in fear
I can't tell you no lies
I'm living in fear, I'm living in fear

Conditioned to hate and them to blame
Their search for God is just the same
Machines for hearts, how warped a view
Forgetting that they're human too
Waiting like a branded steer
Who first will launch the burning spear
When every day may be your last
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You think we'd learn from our past
I'm living in fear, I'm living in fear
I can't tell you no lies
I'm living in fear, I'm living in fear
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I smell the fear that rains inside
The thought of so many lives denied
More wounded soldiers, another burning flag
And rows and rows of body bags
No time for tears as the night falls cold
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The day survivors crawl back in their holes
As for the rest, they're shipped back home
Home to the rows of white tomb stones

I'm living in fear, I'm living in fear
I can't tell you no, tell you no lies now, yeah
I'm living in fear, I'm living in fear
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
