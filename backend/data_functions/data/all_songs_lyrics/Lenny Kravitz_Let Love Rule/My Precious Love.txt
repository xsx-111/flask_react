My Precious Love Lyrics
You came to me like a dream
How would I know it was a scheme
To get me to you

Your eyes burned like fire
Through my heart
Although we were lifetimes apart
Making mistakes was my game
Oh, your life, your life, I tried to rearrange
But now I know a better way

My my my my, my precious love
My my my my, my precious love

Now you're a woman
You've got a child
And those days, those days
Of being wild
They're gone with the past
But now baby
You still haven't got no home
All those endless nights you've had to roam
But I know a better way
My my my my, my precious love
My my my my, my precious love

Go henry

My my my my, my precious love
My my my my, my precious love
My my my my my my my precious love
My my my my, my precious love
You going to make me yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ...Embed
