Does Anybody Out There Even Care Lyrics
The dream is lost
Don't let it slip away
Or bloody days won't be far away
Because when there's no more sun
There's no where you can run

Does anybody know how many lives we've lost
Can anybody ever pay the cost
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends
Does anybody out there even care

Wake up world before it's too late
It's time for love to conquer hate
And when the battle's won
We all can live as one


Hey
Riots in the streets
Men dressed in white sheets
Is that what we want
Oh a little boy hanging from a tree
And a burning cross
If we can learn that we're one we can overcome
Before this takes us all
We'd better catch ourselves before we fall
Does anybody know how many lives we've lost
Yeah hey hey hey
Can anybody ever pay the cost
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends
Does anybody out there even care
Does anybody out there even careEmbed
