Blues For Sister Someone Lyrics
I know a girl who gets off
By sticking needles in her vein
Oh lord what a shame

She's got no money so she turns tricks
And plays dirty games
Oh Lord spare her pain
What she say she do to you
You'd have to be insane
The bathroom stall, her bedroom
The one that's always engaged
She sleeps and eats with the plague
She's got a baby in her belly
But she just don't care
What will become of the pair

Oh Lord what can she do
To get the shit out her hair
To get the shit out her hair

Oh Lord It's not fair
Blues for sister someone
Oh LordEmbed
