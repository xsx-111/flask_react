Mr. Cab Driver Lyrics
Mr. Cab Driver won't stop to let me in
Mr. Cab Driver don't like my kind of skin
Mr. Cab Driver, you're never gonna win
Mr. Cab Driver won't stop to pick me up
Mr. Cab Driver, I might need some help
Mr. Cab Driver only thinks about himself
Here we go

Mr. Cab Driver
Mr. Cab Driver
Mr. Cab Driver
Mr. Cab Driver

Mr. Cab Driver don't like the way I look
He don't like dreads, he thinks we're all crooks
Mr. Cab Driver reads too many story books
Mr. Cab Driver pass me up with eyes of fire
Mr. Cab Driver thinks we're all one-sixty-fivers
Mr. Cab Driver, fuck you, I'm a survivor
Ah yeah, one more time, uh-huh
Let me in, oh

Mr. Cab Driver
Mr. Cab Driver
Mr. Cab Driver
