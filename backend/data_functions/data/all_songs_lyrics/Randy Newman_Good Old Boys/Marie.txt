Marie LyricsYou looked like a princess the night we met
With your hair piled up high, I will never forget
I'm drunk right now, baby, but I've got to be
Or I never could tell you what you mean to me
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you, Marie
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you, Marie
You're the song that the trees sing when the wind blows
You're a flower, you're a river, you're a rainbow
Sometimes I'm crazy, but I guess you know
And I'm weak and I'm lazy and I've hurt you so
And I don't listen to a word you say
When you're in trouble I just turn away
But I loved you
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you, Marie
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you, MarieEmbed
