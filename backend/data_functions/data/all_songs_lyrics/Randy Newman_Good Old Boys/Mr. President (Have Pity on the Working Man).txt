Mr. President (Have Pity on the Working Man) LyricsWe've taken all you've given
But it's gettin' hard to make a livin'
Mr. President, have pity on the working man
We ain't asking you to love us
You may place yourself high above us
Mr. President, have pity on the working man
I know it may sound funny
But people ev'rywhere are runnin' out of money
We just can't make it by ourself
It is cold and the wind is blowing
We need something to keep us going
Mr. President, have pity on the working man
Maybe you've cheated
Maybe you've lied
Maybe you have lost your mind
Maybe you're only thinking 'bout yourself
Too late to run
Too late to cry now
The time has come for us to say goodbye now
Mr. President, have pity on the working man
Mr. President, have pity on the working manEmbed
