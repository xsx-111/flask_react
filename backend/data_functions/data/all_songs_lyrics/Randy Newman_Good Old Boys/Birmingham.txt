Birmingham Lyrics
Got a wife
Got a family
Earn my living with my hand
I'm a roller in a steel mill
In downtown Birmingham
My daddy was a barber
A most unsightly man
He was born in Tuscaloosa
But he died right here in Birmingham

Birmingham, Birmingham
The greatest city in Alabam'
You can travel 'cross this entire land
There ain't no place like Birmingham

My wife's named Mary but she's called Marie
We live in a three room house with a pepper tree
I work all day in the factory
That's alright with me
Got a big black dog and his name is Dan
He lives in my backyard in Birmingham
He's the meanest dog in Alabam'
Get 'em, Dan!
