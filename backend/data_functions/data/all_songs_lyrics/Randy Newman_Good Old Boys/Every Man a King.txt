Every Man a King LyricsWhy weep or slumber America
Land of brave and true?
There's castles and clothing and food for all
All belongs to you
Ev'ry man a King, ev'ry man a King
For you can be a millionaire
But there's something belonging to others
There's enough for all people to share
When it's sunny June and December too
Or in the winter time or spring
There'll be peace without end
Ev'ry neighbor a friend
And ev'ry man a KingEmbed
