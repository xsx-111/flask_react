Naked Man LyricsOld lady lost in the city
In the middle of a cold, cold night
It was fourteen below and the wind start to blow
There wasn't a boy scout in sight
Pull down the shades cause he's comin'
Turn out the lights cause he's here
Runnin' hard down the street
Through the snow and the sleet
On the coldest night of the year
Beware, beware, beware of the Naked Man
Old lady head up toward Broad Street
Shufflin' uptown against the wind
She had started to cry-wiped a tear from her eye
And looked back to see where she had been
Old lady stand on the corner
With a purse in her hand
She does not know but in a minute or so
She will be robbed by a naked man
Beware, beware, beware of the Naked Man
Old lady lean against a lamppost
Starin' down at the ground on which she stand
She look up and scream
For in the lamplight's beam
There stood the famous Naked Man
He say, "They found out about my sister
And kicked me out of the Navy
They would have strung me up if they could
I tried to explain that we were both of us lazy
And were doing the best we could."
He faked to the left and he faked to the right
And he snatched the purse from her hand
"Someone stop me," he cried
As he faded from sight
"Won't nobody help a naked man?"
"Won't nobody help a naked man?"
Beware, beware, beware of the Naked ManEmbed
