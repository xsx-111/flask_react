Guilty LyricsYes, baby, I been drinkin'
And I shouldn't come by, I know
But I found myself in trouble darling
And I had nowhere else to go
Got some whiskey from the barman
Got some cocaine from a friend
I just had to keep on movin'
'Til I was back in your arms again
I'm guilty
Baby, I'm guilty
And I'll be guilty all the rest of my life
How come I never do
What I'm supposed to do
How come nothing that I try to do
Ever turns out right?
You know, you know how it is with me, baby
You know I just can't stand myself
And it takes a whole lot of medicine
For me to pretend that I'm somebody elseEmbed
