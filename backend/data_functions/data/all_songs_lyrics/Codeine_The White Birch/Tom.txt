Tom Lyrics
My words have broken throats
Too ashamed to speak
Afflicted by disease
They are so weak

I'll throw sand in your eye
You need a reason to cry
I'll throw sand in your eye
I need a reason to smile

I went to school to learn
But it didn't work
How do you learn to try?
Why can't I?

I'll throw sand in your eye
You need a reason to cry
I'll throw sand in your eye
I need a reason to smileEmbed
