Vacancy LyricsDream in black and white
Model cities, shooting up, in the sky
Did they go to sleep, just to die, just to drown, in the air?
Look under the bed
There's no ghosts, that I can see
Tires burning
Can't go back there
Can't go forward
What does the word vacancy mean, when you don't expect anything?
Don't even try to justify, there's no way to justifyEmbed
