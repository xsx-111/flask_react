In the Presence of Enemies - Part I Lyrics



I saw a white light shining there before me
And walking to it, I waited for the end
A final vision promising salvation
A resurrection for a fallen man

Do you still wait for your God
And the symbol of your faith?

I can free you from this Hell and misery
You should never be ashamed, my son
I can give you power beyond anything
Trust me you will be the chosen one

I was forgotten, a body scorned and broken
My soul rejected, tainted by his blood
Beyond redemption, a sinner not worth saving
Forever taken from the one I loved
Do I still wait for my God
And a symbol of my faith?

I can lead you down the path and back to life
All I ask is that you worship me
I can help you seek revenge and save yourself
Give you life for all eternity

Servants of the fallen fight to pave the way
For their savior's calling on this wicked day
Through a veil of madness, with a vicious blade
One man rises up, standing in their way
Redemption
Redemption for humanity!2Embed
