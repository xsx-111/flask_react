Prophets of War Lyrics
It burns deep down inside of me
We have ourselves to blame
Not questioning, accept it as the truth
Debate this fight, it's just cause
The facts do not support theirs
To liberate a people
And rid them of tyrant rule
Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
It's time to make the change!

Intrigued, got your attention
Deceived since the inception
Our brave fight for what reason?
Compelled, can we clean up this mess?
The loss of loved ones, a perverse request
They continue the same rhetoric
These derelicts that profit win or lose
Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
It's time to make the change!
Time for change!
Fight the fear!
Find the truth!
Time for change!

The only thing that I believe
Will help us see this through is faith
Pray they will forgive!
Forgive our arrogance
So we can make it right
Right what they have wronged
See you sweat
Unexpected, controversial
Get used to it
Things are gonna get personal
Your sympathy
A pitiful display, you stutter
Your empathy
Means nothing if there is no honor
Responsible
Of this you are incapable
We implicate, incriminate
Exacerbate, too much at stake
Our fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers
Sons and daughters forced
Perpetuating their ideals
A mindless act to stay the course
Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
Is it time to make a change
A change from what it's been?
Can we help them break away?
Is our patience wearing thin?
It's time to make a change!
Time for change!
Fight the fear!
Find the truth!
Time for change!1Embed
