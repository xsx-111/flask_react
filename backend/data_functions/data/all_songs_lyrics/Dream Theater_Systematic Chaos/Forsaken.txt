Forsaken Lyrics
For a while I thought I fell asleep
Lying motionless inside a dream
Then rising suddenly, I felt a chilling breath upon me
She softly whispered in my ear!

Forsaken, I have come for you tonight
Awaken, look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me!

I waited painfully for night to fall again
Trying to silence the fear within me
Out of the night and mist I felt a stinging kiss
And saw a crimson stain on her lips
I have to know your name
Where have I seen your face before?
My dear one, don't you be afraid

Forsaken, I have come for you tonight
Awaken, look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me!
Take me far away!
Close your eyes and hold your breath
To the ends of the earth!


Forsaken, I have come for you tonight
Awaken, look in my eyes and take my hand
Forsaken, fly away with me tonight
Awaken, renew my life, now you are mine
Give yourself up to me!2Embed
