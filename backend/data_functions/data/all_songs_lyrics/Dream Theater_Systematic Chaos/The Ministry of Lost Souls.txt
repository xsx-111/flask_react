The Ministry of Lost Souls Lyrics
The water's edge is where she waits
Lost soul still wandering
Meant to die but she's stuck
Not crossing over
The other side is where he waits
His spirit reaching out
Meant to save but she's too scared
To take his hand

Living in a world without you (Drowning in the past)
Is living in no world at all
So now I call on you

Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now
Don't turn your back on paradise!

Feeling scared, she's prepared
To give up everything
She can't stand
To feel like half of her is fading
He will choose the only way
To rid her of her pain
Take her soul now
The decision has been made

Living in a world without love (A burden to my soul)
Is living in a worthless world
So I will call on you

Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now
Remember me, you were so young
How could I tell you?
Remember me, I am the one
Who saved your life that night

I was the one
Who would not abandon you
Even in death
I was the one who would not leave you
I used my freedom to protect you
And all the while direct you
Do you remember me this time?
Even in death, I gave you life
I gave you life!

I wanted to deserve a place
A place beside you
This time when I reached out my hand
It reached all the way to heaven

Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now
Goodbye!
It's almost over now
Goodbye!
It's time
I release you from this life
Don't turn your back on paradise!
