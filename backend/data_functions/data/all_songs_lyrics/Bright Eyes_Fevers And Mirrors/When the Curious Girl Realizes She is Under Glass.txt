When the Curious Girl Realizes She is Under Glass LyricsTomorrow when I wake up, I'm finding my brother
And I'm making him take me back down to the water
That lake where we sailed and we laughed with our father
I will not desert him
I will not desert him
No matter how I may wish for a coffin so clean
Or these trees to undress all their leaves onto me
I put my face in the dirt and then finally I see
The sky that has been avoiding me
And I started this letter
I'm gonna send it to Ruba
Be blessed by her eyes on the Gulf Coast of Florida
With her feet in the sand and one hand on her swimsuit
She will recite the prayer of my pen
Saying "Time take us forward, relief from this longing
They can land that plane on my heart, I don't care
Just give me November, the warmth of a whisper
In the freezing darkness of my room"
But no matter what I would do in attempt to replace
All these pills that I take, trying to balance my brain
I've seen the curious girl with that look on her face
So surprised she stares out from her display case2Embed
