Arienette LyricsThe fragile keep secrets, gathered in pockets
And they'll sell them for nothing a cheap watch or locket
That kind of gold washes off
And the sad act like lepers, they stick to the shadows
And long to ring bells of warning to tell of their coming
So that the pure can shut their doors
And the angry are animals senseless and savage
They act without order in logical lapses
They stain their mouths with blood
So take my hand, this barren land is alive tonight
The corn has grown stalks that form a wall too high
But the wind carries sounds that I can't see from beyond that line
Then the stalks begin to sway
Oh stay with me Arienette until the wolves are away
Well the wicked are vultures, and they bake in the canyons
They circle in sunlight and wait for their victims
To collapse and call to them
And the desperate are water. They will run down forever
As they soak into silence mend up together
In a dark and distant, dark and distant place
So don't leave me here with only mirrors watching me
This house it holds nothing but the memories
And the moon it leaves silver but never sleep
And then the silver turns to gray
Oh stay with me Arienette until the wolves are away3Embed
