Sunrise, Sunset LyricsSunrise, sunset
Sunrise, sunset
Swiftly go the days
Sunrise, sunset
You wake up, then you undress
It always is the same
The sunrise and the sunsets
You are lying while you confess, keep trying to explain
The sunrise and the sunsets
You realize then you forget what you've been trying to retain
But everybody knows that it is all about the things
That get stuck inside of your head
Like the songs your roommate sings
Or a vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed
She raised her hands in the air, asked you
When was the last time you looked in the mirror?
Cause you've changed
Yeah, you've changed
Sunrises, sunsets
You're hopeful then you regret
The circle never breaks
With a sunrise and a sunset there's a change of heart or address
Is there nothing that remains?
For a sunrise or a sunset
You're manic or you're depressed
Will you ever feel ok?
For a sunrise or a sunset, your lover is an actress
Did you really think she'd stay?
For a sunrise or a sunset
You're either coming or you just left but you're always on the way
Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet
They are really just the same
To the sunrise and the sunset
The master and his servant have exactly the same fate
It's a sunrise and a sunset
From a cradle to a casket
There is no way to escape
The sunrise and the sunset
Hold your sadness like a puppet, keep putting on the play
But everything you do is leading to the point
Where you just won't know what to do
And at that moment you may laugh
But there is someone there who will be laughing louder than you
So it's true, the trick is complete
Become everything you said you never would be
You're a fool! You're a fool!
Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset
Sunrise and the sunsets
Sunrise, sunset, sunrises, sunsets
Sunrise and the sunsets
Sunrise, sunset
Go home to your apartment
And put the cassette in the tape deck and let that fever play
Sunrise, sunset
Where are you Arienette?
Where are you Arienette?2Embed
