Something Vague LyricsNow and again it seems worse than it is
But mostly the view is accurate
You see your breath in the air as you'll climb up the stairs
To that coffin you call your apartment
And you sink in your chair, brush the snow from your hair
And drink the cold away
And you're not really sure what you're doing this for
But you need something to fill up the days
A few more hours
There's a dream in my brain that just won't go away
It's been stuck there since it came a few nights ago
And I'm standing on a bridge in the town where I lived
As a kid with my mom and my brothers
And then the bridge disappears and I'm standing on air
With nothing holding me
And I hang like a star, fucking glow in the dark
For all those starving eyes to see
Like the ones we've wished on
But now I'm confused. Is this death really you?
And do these dreams have any meaning?
No. No, I think it's more like a ghost that's been following us both
Something vague that we're not seeing
Something more like a feeling2Embed
