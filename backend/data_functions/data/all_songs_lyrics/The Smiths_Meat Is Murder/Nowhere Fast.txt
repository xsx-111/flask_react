Nowhere Fast Lyrics
I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means (of slender means)
Each household appliance is like a new science in my town

And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean

And when a train goes by it's such a sad sound
It's such a sad thing

I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
Every sensible child will know what this means
The poor and the needy are selfish and greedy on her terms

And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean

And when a train goes by it's such a sad sound
It's such a sad thing
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life and I think about death
And neither one particularly appeals to me

And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
In the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die8Embed
