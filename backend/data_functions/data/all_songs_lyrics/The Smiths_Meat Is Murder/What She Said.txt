What She Said Lyrics
What she said
"How come someone hasn't noticed that I'm dead
And decided to bury me? God knows, I'm ready!"

What she said was sad
But then, all the rejection she's had
To pretend to be happy could only be idiocy

What she said
Was not for the job or lover that she never had

What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
(It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really really open her eyes)
What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
(It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really really open her eyes)

What she said
"I smoke 'cause I'm hoping for an early death
And I need to cling to something!"
What she said
"I smoke 'cause I'm hoping for an early death
And I need to cling to something!"Embed
