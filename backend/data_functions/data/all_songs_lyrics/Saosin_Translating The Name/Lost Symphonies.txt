Lost Symphonies LyricsTo install the notion that I divided by I
Replace the occasion to speak
I'm not the only lonely boy...
Until I decide to take my watch off, I'll still believe that we
We're just a matter of time, still killing almost everything
(Shout for shout sake)
Siren siren, don't do this dance in my ear
In fact I've already lost him once
I do a deadly dance and all I've asked for so little
I've already lost him
If I decide to sever the plates below
The shore would separate and find only seven placed again
Until I decide to take my watch off, I'll still believe that we
Were just a matter of time, still killing almost everything
(Shout for shout sake)
Siren siren, don't do this dance in my ear
In fact I've already lost him once
I do a deadly dance and all I've asked for so little
In fact I've already lost him
Before commemorating this anniversary
(Ten feet tall and I still have the right to say, I hope you still believe)Embed
