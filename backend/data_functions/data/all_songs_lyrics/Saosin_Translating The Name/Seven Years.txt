Seven Years Lyrics
Taking on seven years
The holy ghost had left alone
Test my arms, kick like crazy
I've been trying way too long
Only push the way off to fight you
Now I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure
Getting off my chest
The story ends

I will find a way without
Tell him his eyes see too clear
I will find a way without you
Tell him his eyes see too clear

That mistake was gold
I know that without you
Is something that I could never do
That was why, staple the eyes and
Seven dates for me to sell machines
And tear on

Seven years, you assured me
That I'd be fine if I complied
Only push the way off to fight you
(Only push the way off to fight you)
Now I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure
Getting off my chest
The story ends
I will find a way without
Tell him his eyes see too clear
I will find a way without you
Tell him his eyes see too clear

That mistake was gold
I know that without you Is something that I could never do
That was why, stand through the cold and
Seven dates for me to sell machines
And tear on

Don't treat me, I'm to blame (Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure)
Don't treat me like I ever accused you
Don't treat me, I'm to blame (Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure)
Don't treat me like I ever accused you
Don't treat me, I'm to blame (Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure)
Don't treat me like I ever accused you
Don't treat me, I'm to blame (Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure)
Don't treat me like I ever accused you
Don't treat me, I'm to blame (Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure)
Don't treat me like I ever accused you4Embed
