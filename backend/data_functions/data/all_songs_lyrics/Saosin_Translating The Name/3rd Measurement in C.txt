3rd Measurement in C LyricsTaking back, overdone
Free and safely
Souvenirs, out of style
Right in front and right on
Do it so, I'll be mad, you'll be gone
And I'm sad that you'll be gold upon
Gold in my veins
Tango with daddy and separate only
Smile my only rights of passage
Only you, mark my words
Upon the stage you strike off
To get engaged in California
And I'm sad that you'll be gold upon
Gold in my veins
Tango with daddy and separate only
Smile my only rights of passage
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
I want to know
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to loseEmbed
