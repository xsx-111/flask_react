Translating the Name LyricsOh, start saving green and before breathing
(I have your voice on tape in a southern accent screaming at me)
I was only one and we weren't prepared for one before dreaming
(I have your voice on tape in a southern accent screaming at me)
Now things look lovely to you
Holding back, now and forever
Sweetheart, things look lovely
Longing for midnight and I deny
You were walking so peculiar like (Still so deadly)
You had something to hide
You were walking so peculiar like (Still so deadly)
You had something to hide, love
Sweet penance for a sound
It might explode in our hands
I'm bordered in a brown pigmentation of
Where the only bonds cut short, turned in, then stopped
I've been watching Rose give in and
I missed out on savoring it so
I've been watching Rose give in to it
Severing the ties between mother and son
I've been watching Rose give in to it
Severing the ties between mother and son
Now things look lovely to you
Holding back, now and forever
Sweetheart, things look lovely
Long for midnight and I deny
You were walking so peculiar like (Still so deadly)
You had something to hide, love
You were walking so peculiar like (Still so deadly)
You had something to hide
Sweet penance for a sound
It might explode in our hands
It might explode
Sweet penance for a sound
It might explode in our hands
It might explode
Oh why would so many place the oath
I promised the world and a dozen roses
Oh why would so many place the oath
I promised the world and a dozen rosesEmbed
