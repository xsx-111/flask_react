They Perched On Their Stilts, Pointing and Daring Me to Break Custom LyricsOn my face I scratched out something like a silhouette
Around the golden ten like lambs
On my face I've hidden away any embarrassment
Away from my acquaintances
I'm not sold on anything but half a dream
I'm not sensing a thing
I see a blank notebook page
And it's my life and there is
Nothing I can think to write
I fear the thought of not sensing a thing
I hope you don't see a thing
Smile through everyone you ever meet
(so what you gave him the time of day)
Twist back and end this suffering
I'll dance around, I honestly give up and de robe
I see a blank notebook page
And it's my life and there is
Nothing I can think to write
I fear the thought of not sensing a thing
Right side falls
Heavenly grace to you I owe you too
Right side because
Heaven and I should be so easyEmbed
