What I Must Do LyricsI used to plan and plot
And try to live correct
Lately I do a lot
Of things that don't make sense
Now I must
Do what I must
Now why do you
Think that a man
Jumps out of the frying pan
Into the fire
When he can
Find a way not to get burned
I must do what I must do
And I do, though I know better
I must do what I must do
Even though he's gonna get it
Below the sky above
Beyond what's good and true
Something as loud as love
Falls out, I can't refuse
Now I must
Do what I must
Now why do you
Think that a man
Jumps out of the frying pan
Into the fire
When he can
Find a way not to get burned
I must do what I must do
And I do, though I know better
I must do what I must do
Even though he might regret it
I must do what I must do
And I do, though I know better
I must do what I must do
Even though he's gonna get itEmbed
