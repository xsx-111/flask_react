Time Out for Fun Lyrics
Hello
This is Devo
We would like to say
Things go both ways
New ideas, stupid moves
Nightmares, or dreams come true
Mucho work minus play
Tension mounts in a twisted face
Dark clouds in a crystal ball
Tension mounts in a foreign place
The screw turns, someone calls:
Time out for fun!
Time out for fun!

So you're living under the gun
Circumstances have you on the run
A doctor frowns, you feel bad
Take this! You've just been had!

Don't you lose it - now listen to us:
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT!
Take a break - take some time;
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT!
Don't you lose it - remember to take
TIME OUT FOR FUN!
So your life has just begun
Somebody else is saying that it's done
Nurses whisper, others grin -
Something's funny at your expense again!

Don't you lose it - now listen to us:
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT!
Take a break - take some time;
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT!
Don't you lose it - remember to take
TIME OUT FOR FUN!Embed
