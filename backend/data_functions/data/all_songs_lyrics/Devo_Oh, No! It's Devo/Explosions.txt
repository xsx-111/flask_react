Explosions LyricsWe like explosions that leave you feeling good
We like ideas that change the world for good
There's nothing past the stop 'n' go
There's nothing but the ebb and flow
There's nothing like some in and out
There's nothing more than what you know
Yes - Oh, yeah!
Yes - Oh, yeah!
We like new places that jets can't take you to
We do like music when it does what it should do
There's nothing past the stop 'n' go
There's nothing but the ebb and flow
There's nothing like some in and out
There's nothing more than what you know
Yes - Oh, yeah!
Yes - Oh, yeah!
Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)
Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)
We like explosions - it's only right we should
We like ideas we thought you understood
We like new places until they're overrun
We do like music - loud shots from the big spudgun
Yes - Oh, yeah!
Yes - Oh, yeah!
Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)
Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)
Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)
Yes - (We like) Oh, yeah! (Explosions)Embed
