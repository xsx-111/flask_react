Deep Sleep LyricsI've been walking in a deep sleep
Sleepwalking, but I just woke up
From a deep sleep
A very deep sleep
I've been running on remote control
In a deep sleep
A very deep sleep
I awoke the moment I was told
That a smile is just a frown turned around
On the face of a clown with a mean streak
It was a deep sleep
A very deep sleep
I can't remember what I used to know
In my deep sleep
A very deep sleep
Somebody help me now and let me go
Into a deep sleep
Now I just woke up from a deep sleep
Somebody -
Push me back, now, let me go
Into a dream again
To a sleep unlike before
So deep it never ends
I've been caught inside a deep sleep
Sinking deeper after I forgot
That a smile is just a frown turned around
On the face of a clown with a mean streak
In my deep sleep
A very deep sleep
Sleepwalking as I watch myself
In a deep sleep
I'm in this deep sleep
I keep pretending that it's someone else
In a deep sleep
Now I can't get up out of my deep sleep
I'm in a -
Deep sleep
But I just woke up from a deep sleep
Somebody -Embed
