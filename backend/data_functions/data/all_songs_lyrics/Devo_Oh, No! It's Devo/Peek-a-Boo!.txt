Peek-a-Boo! LyricsPeekaboo
I can see you
And I know what you do
So put your hands on your face
And cover up your eyes
Don't look until I signal
Peekaboo
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Peekaboo
The way that we were
Is what we'll become
So please pay attention
While I show you some
Of what's about to happen
Peekaboo
I know what you do
Cause I do it too
So put your hands on your face
And cover up your eyes
Don't look until I signal
Peekaboo
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Peekaboo
Laugh if you want to or say you don't care
If you can not see it, you think it's not there
It doesn't work that way
Peekaboo
I can see you
And I know what you do
So put your hands on your face
And cover up your eyes
Don't look until I signal
Peekaboo
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
