Speed Racer LyricsI'm Speed Racer and I drive real fast!
(He's Speed Racer and he drives real fast!)
(He's Speed Racer and he drives real fast!)
I drive real fast—I'm gonna last!
I'm a big pirate and I like to steal!
(He's a big pirate and he likes to steal!)
(He's a big pirate and he likes to steal!)
I like to steal and I like to kill!
AHA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
RAH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
Go! Go! Go, Speed Racer!
Go! Go! Go, Speed Racer!
Go! Go! Go, Speed Racer!
Go! Go! Go, Speed Racer!
I'm a Barbie doll, but I got brains!
(She's a Barbie doll, but she's got brains!)
I've got brains and I like sex!
(Lots of brains and she likes sex!)
I'm your doctor and here's the bill!
(He's your doctor and here's the bill!)
Doctors steal and here's the bill!
(He likes to steal, so here's your bill!)
I'm Speed Racer and I drive real fast!
I'm a big pirate and I like to steal!
I'm a Barbie doll, but I got brains!
I'm your doctor and here's the bill!
I drive real fast—I'm gonna last!
I like to drink and I like to kill!
Lots of brains and I like sex!
Like to steal, and here's your bill!Embed
