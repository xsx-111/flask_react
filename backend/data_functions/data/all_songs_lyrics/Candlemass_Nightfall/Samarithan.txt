Samarithan Lyrics
One day, I saw a man
Dressed in rags, with a staff in his hand
Begging for a penny to survive
How poor a man can be
I gave him hospitality
A room, a bed, and lots of food to eat

Still, I hear his last few words
"I can never return what you've done
But heaven will remember and repay"
Fifty years had gone since I saw him
I was dying and I'd soon be dead
Three angels stood in front of my bed

The first one, she said to me, "Don't be afraid
I'll give you immortality and grace for your soul"
The second had eyes of gold, she gave me my wings
The third gave all wisdom an angel could bring to me

One day, I saw a man
Dressed in rags, with a staff in his hand
Begging for a penny to survive
How poor a man can be
I gave him hospitality
A room, a bed, and lots of food to eat

I joined with my destiny, eternally
I knew I was born again, an angel to be
A vision beyond my dreams called me, by name
So in devotion, I spread my wings
To heaven, I'd came to stayEmbed
