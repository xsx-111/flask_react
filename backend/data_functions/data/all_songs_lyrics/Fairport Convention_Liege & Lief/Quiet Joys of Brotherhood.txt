Quiet Joys of Brotherhood LyricsI can't believe that it's so cold
As gentle tides go rolling by
Along the salt sea strand
The colours blend and roll as one
Together in the sand
And often do the winds entwine
Do send their distant call
The quiet joys of brotherhood
And love is lord of all
The oak and weed together rise
Along the common ground
The mare and stallion light and dark
Have thunder in their sound
The rainbow sign, the blended flower
Still have my heart in thrall
The quiet joys of brotherhood
And love is lord of all
But man has come to plough the tide
The oak lies on the ground
I hear their tires in the fields
They drive the stallion down
The roses bleed both light and dark
The winds do seldom call
The running sands recall the time
When love was lord of allEmbed
