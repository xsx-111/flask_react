Reynardine LyricsOne evening as I rambled
Among the leaves so green
I overheard a young woman
Converse with Reynardine
Her hair was black, her eyes
Were blue, her lips as red as wine
And he smiled to gaze upon her
Did that sly, bold Reynardine
She said, "Kind sir, be civil
My company forsake
For in my own opinion
I fear you are some rake."
"Oh no," he said, "no rake am I
Brought up in Venus' train
But I'm seeking for concealment
All along the lonesome plain."
"Your beauty so enticed me
I could not pass it by
So it's with my gun I'll guard you
All on the mountain side."
"And if by chance you should look
For me, perhaps you'll not me find
For I'll be in my castle
Inquire for Reynardine."
Sun and dark she followed him
His teeth did brightly shine
And he led her up a-the mountains
Did that sly, bold ReynardineEmbed
