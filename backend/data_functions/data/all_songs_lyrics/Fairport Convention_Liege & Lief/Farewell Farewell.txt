Farewell Farewell LyricsFarewell, farewell to you who would hear
You lonely travellers all
The cold north wind will blow again
The winding road does call
And will you never return to see
Your bruised and beaten sons?
"Oh, I would, I would, if welcome I were
For they loathe me, every one"
And will you never cut the cloth
Or drink the light to be?
And can you never swear a year
To any one of we?
"No, I will never cut the cloth
Or drink the light to be
But I'll swear a year to one who lies
Asleep along side of me"
Farewell, farewell to you who would hear
You lonely travellers all
The cold north wind will blow again
The winding road does callEmbed
