Come All Ye LyricsCome all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky
Those that dance will start to dance
And those who don't will sway
In time to this our merry tune
That we play for you today
So come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky
Our fiddler, he just loves to play
And that's why he plays so good
And now he plays a violin
Made out of solid wood
So come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky
Possessor of the magic touch
But no magician, he
Will play for you some magic notes
Instead as you will see
So come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky
The sound of beating on the drums
From behind you hear
And to the rhythm of guitar
We hope you'll lend an ear
So come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky
Well, the man who plays the bass does make
Those low notes that you hear
And the high notes come from you and me
For we will sing so clear
So come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling skyEmbed
