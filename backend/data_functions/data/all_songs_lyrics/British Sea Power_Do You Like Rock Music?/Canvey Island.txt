Canvey Island LyricsH5N1 killed a wild swan
It was a kind of omen
Of everything to come
I can't believe it's happening
And that it's happening now
I can't believe it's happening
It's coming true somehow
On Canvey Island, 1953
Many lives were lost
With the records of a football team
I can't believe it's happening
And that it's happening now
I can't believe it's happening
It's coming true somehow
Don't you think it's strange, you know
The way it all works out
Brace yourself for storms and Summer droughts
Sometimes it's hard to tell
If it's going well
You know the odds against it
Were so phenomenal
I can't believe it's happening
And that it's happening now
I can't believe it's happening
It's coming true somehow
Don't you think it's strange, you know
The way it all works out
Brace yourself for storms and Summer droughts
Don't you think it's strange, you know
The way it all works out
You start with everything then live without
Oh!
Oh, oh!
Ohhh...(etc.)
Oh it's happening now
Oh it's happening now
Oh...Embed
