Lights Out for Darker Skies LyricsOh lights out baby, for darker skies
There really is no reason that you need to ask why
When you fall like sparks from a muzzle
Like moths that get confused
By all the man-made moons
So go gentle in this dark, dark night
When something's wrong you know
It just ain't right
And you dance like sparks from a muzzle
And you fall like sparks from a muzzle
Welcome for the day or stay forever
There's things which we all need to navigate
Daisy chains of lights around the city now
They glow but never quite illuminate
Hell and high water, won't stop us now
The future's twisted, righteousness is coming back around
Oh we fall like sparks from a muzzle
Unless two thousand and seven
Becomes a pitch black heaven
Oh stop acting like you're my best friend
When you don't know why and you don't care how it ends
And you dance like sparks from a muzzle
And you fall like sparks from a muzzle
Welcome for the day or stay forever
There's things that we all need to navigate
Daisy chains of lights around the city now
They glow but never quite illuminate
So dance like sparks from a muzzle
So dance like sparks from a muzzle
And we were lit by kerosene
And we were lit by acetylene
And we walked under neon skies
You know it made me wonder why
Why all the frequencies combine
And form a cleaner, brighter light
And we filled our florescent sails
It led to sodium-scarred wailing weeks
Hey now now, oh the future's bright
Oh hey now now, a history of light repeat now now
Because you know it's right
Oh hey now now, a history of light repeat now now
Hey now now, oh the future's bright
Oh hey now now, a history of light repeat now now
Hey now now, because you know it's right
Oh hey now now a history of light
You know it's right
You know it's right
You know it's right
You know it's right
You know it's...Embed
