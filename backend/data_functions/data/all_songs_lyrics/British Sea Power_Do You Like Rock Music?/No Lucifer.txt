No Lucifer LyricsEASY! EASY! EASY! EASY! EASY! EASY!
Hey you, give me the dummy tits
Forget the rest of the shit
The man with the skull and bones
You think you know, but you don't
To Sodom I will go
Not to Megiddo
Several Lucifers come
We can beat them all
A Carlton Corsair
A Raleigh Twenty, yeah!
A little lost roe deer
The wind in your hair
NO LUCIFER!
Come on, Allons-y let's go
Can always just say no
To the anti-aircraft crew
The boys from the Hitler Youth
Silk and cyanide
Six weeks left alive
Not the skull and bone
You think you know but you don't
To Sodom I will go
Not to Megiddo
Several Lucifers come
We can beat them all
A Carlton Corsair
A Raleigh Twenty, yeah!
A little lost roe deer
The wind in your hair
NO LUCIFER!
EASY! EASY! EASY!
Is that what the future holds?
Is that what the future holds?
Kevlar or cherry wood
Malevolence or good
Is that what the future holds?
Is that what the future holds?
Is that what the future holds?
Is that what the future holds?
NO LUCIFER!Embed
