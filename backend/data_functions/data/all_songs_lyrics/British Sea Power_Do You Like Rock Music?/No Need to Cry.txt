No Need to Cry LyricsWhen it's good, it's not bad
When it's bad, I don't mind if you're queer
Let's be happy while we're here
I don't clap, I don't cheer
I don't look, I don't hear
It's alright, I don't mind that you're here
It's alright
I sit up, sip my tears
As they're falling down in my beer
No need to cry at all
No need to cry at all
No need to cry at all
There's no need to cry at all
Play the game, cup your ears
Let's be happy while we're here
Coming, coming coming out of your eye, I don't mind
Coming, coming coming down from your eye, I don't mind
No need to cry at all
No need to cry at all
No need to cry at all
There's no need to cry at all
Coming, coming coming out of your eye, I don't mind
Coming, coming coming out of your eye, I don't mind
No need to cry at all
No need to cry at allEmbed
