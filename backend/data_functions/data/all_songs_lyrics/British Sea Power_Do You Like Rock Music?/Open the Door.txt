Open the Door LyricsAre you gonna live or die?
Are you gonna live or die?
Are you gonna be all right?
Are you gonna live or die?
Are you gonna be all right?
Five young men went for a walk
Sat on a tree stump and had a talk
It takes something to be a man these days
Nobody's scared, but we hide anyway
We're almost there
And now it's coming back to me
Ah, we're almost there
So are you coming back to me?
Are you gonna live or die?
Are you gonna live or die?
Are you gonna be all right?
Shatter your vases, settle your loans
Get on a slow boat to Mexico
Talking of rabies, you need it, lad
Take her, hold her, but don't go mad
Open the door
You've gotta see just what it's for
Now we're almost there
So are you coming back to me?
I'm not afraid of the big black bear
Only humans make me scared
I'm not afraid of misery
My life is a vapour, and you can't break her
Ah
No taste or understanding of the working
In her microbes
Let it show
In our bathrobes
Let her know
Let it rip
Whoo
Five young men went for a walk
Sat on a tree stump and had a talk
It takes something to be a man these days
Nobody cares but everyone's caring
Ah, these days, ah
Are we almost there?
It is just how you imagine
Are you gonna live or die?
Are you gonna live or die?
Are you gonna be all right?
Are you gonna live or die?
Are you gonna live or die?
Are you gonna be all right?
Whoo
Are you gonna
Are you gonna
Are
Are you gonna
Are you gonna live or die?Embed
