Down on the Ground LyricsWhere I come from, silvery trees
Diamond on leaf, can't you see it?
Why did I leave?
The clipping of wings
The draping of kings
I was here long before you
Now kindly leave
This was far far away
And I knew I would not stay
Down on the ground
I'll be found
I opened up my mouth
I didn't make a sound
I could not cut you down, down, down
I was a girl and you were a boy
With innocent thoughts getting colder
Than it was before
This was long long ago
And I knew we'd never know
Down on the ground
I'll be found
I opened up my mouth
I didn't make a sound
I could not cut you down, down, down
Down, down, down
Could not cut you downEmbed
