Waving Flags LyricsYou are astronomical
Fans of alcohol
So welcome in
Arising in the east
And setting in the west
All waving flags
We're all waving flags now
Waving flags
But don't be scared
And you
You're only here for a while
And it's all a joke
Oh, it's all a joke
Ohh
Are you of legal drinking age?
On minimum wage?
Well, welcome in
From across the Vistula
You've come so very far
All waving flags
We're all waving flags now
Waving flags
But don't be scared
And you
You're only here for a while (Don't be scared)
And it's all a joke (Don't be scared)
Oh, it's all a joke (Don't be scared)
Ohh
Beer is not dark
Beer is not light
It just tastes good
Especially tonight
Oh, welcome in
So welcome in
We are barbarians
Oh, welcome in
Cross the Carpathians
Oh, welcome in
We are from Slavia
Oh, welcome in
Across the stadion
Oh, we can't fail
Not with Czech ecstasy
No, we won't fail
Not with Czech ecstasy
So welcome inEmbed
