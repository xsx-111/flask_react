Ice Age (deadmau5 Remix) LyricsI find it looks the same but everything has changed
I find remembering gets harder every day
Sometimes I still believe who I pretend to be
Sometimes well everything's exactly how it seems
Exactly how it seems
I see the color of your eyes has turned to grey

Sometimes I open up the walls and disappear
Sometimes the crashing of the waves is all I hear
Ocean
Help me find a way
Ocean

I know that everything we did will come around
I take the thought of you and burn it to the ground
Sometimes Iâ€™m waiting for this ice age to arrive
Sometimes the hate in me is keeping me alive
Ocean
Help me find a way
Ocean
Wash us all away
Ocean

Every day is getting shorter
I can feel it coming1Embed
