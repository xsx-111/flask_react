Mind Eraser Lyrics
When I need to replace her
I am the mind eraser
Anything goes, yeah, anything goes
Got this sin in her brain
But she ain't gonna see me again
See me again, this I know
But oh, deep down I can't let go

Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
No, don't let it be over, let it be over, oh

Seen me stack up my woes
Into a wall, around a rose
'Round a rose, now she knows
Oh, it hurts so, I can't let go

Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
No, don't let it be over, let it be over, oh
Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
No, don't let it be over, let it be over, oh1Embed
