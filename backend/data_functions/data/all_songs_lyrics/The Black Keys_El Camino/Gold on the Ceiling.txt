Gold on the Ceiling Lyrics
Down in the waves
She screams again
Roar at the door
My mind can't take much more

I could never drown in

They wanna get my
They wanna get my gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind, just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's all right, ain't no guarding my high

Clouds covered love's
Barb-wired snare
Strung up, strung out
I just can't go without

I could never drown in

They wanna get my
They wanna get my gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind, just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's all right, ain't no guarding my high
They wanna get my
They wanna get my gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind, just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's all right, ain't no guarding my high
Gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind, just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's all right, ain't no guarding my high24Embed
