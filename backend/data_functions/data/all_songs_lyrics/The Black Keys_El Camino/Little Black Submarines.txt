Little Black Submarines Lyrics
Little black submarines
Operator, please put me back on the line
Told my girl I'd be back
Operator, please
This is wreckin' my mind

Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

Pick you up, let you down
When I wanna go to a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans
But they just disappeared to the back of my mind

Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
Treasure maps, fallen trees
Operator, please call me back when it's time
Stolen friends and disease
Operator, please patch me back to my mind

Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind55Embed
