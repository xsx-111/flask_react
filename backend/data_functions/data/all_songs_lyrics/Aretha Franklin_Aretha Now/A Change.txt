A Change Lyrics
I'm looking for a love-maker
I ain't looking for no heartbreaker

It ain't no fooling around with this
Ain't no fooling around with that
You've been playing the scene long enough
To know just where it's at
Some people call me selfish because I want you to myself
But it better be a crazy day in July if I catch you with someone else

I wanna see a change in you, baby
I wanna see a change right away
I wanna see a change in you, baby
I wanna see a change in you today
If you don't, this girl is gonna make you pay
If you don't, this girl is gonna make you pay
I wanna see a big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby

I hope you've been busy 'bout what you know
'Cause they say you gotta reap what you sow
And you say you know that I'm for you
When you had a choice of quite a few
Well, you just picked out what you wanted
And it was me you said you liked
And I must admit you got good taste
So great to get over right
I wanna see a change in you, baby
I wanna see a change in you today
I wanna see a change in you, baby
I wanna see a change in you today
If you don't, this girl is gonna make you pay
I wanna see a big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby

I'm looking for a love-maker
Can't use no heartbreakers
I wanna see a big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
I wanna see a big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, babyEmbed
