Who Can I Count On Lyrics
Who can I count on, if I can't count on you?
I never counted on you making me blue
They say your a running 'round with somebody new
Who can I count on, if I can't count on you?
I thought I held a precious key to Heaven
Your love was sweet and gentle at the start
But now I feel that I can't go on living
If living means that we must live apart

Who can I count on, if I can't count on you?
There goes my happiness and here comes the blues
I can't convince myself that we're really through
Who can I count on, if I can't count on you?

The door to happiness was almost open
Just one more step or two and I'd be in
Then all at once the vows you made were broken
The door to happiness was closed again


Who can I count on? Who can I count on?
Who can I count on, if I can't count on you?Embed
