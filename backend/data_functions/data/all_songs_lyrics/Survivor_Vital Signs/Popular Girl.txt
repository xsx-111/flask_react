Popular Girl LyricsWhen she walks in the room, every eye in the place
Turns to follow her every move
She's arrived on the scene in her diamonds and jeans
World class -- she's got nothing to prove
It takes a long time to know her, she gives it up a little at a time
*She's gettin' what she wants
She's a popular girl
Settin' those hearts on fire
Everybody wants to be
Part of her world
She's a popular girl
Such a popular girl*
She walks down the street, knocks 'em dead on their feet
With a casual nonchalance
When she's breaking your heart, she's the state of the art
With license to take what she wants
It takes a hard man to hold her, she likes to get a little out of line
( * Repeat)
She waits by the window, the world is her stage
Each smile is her mirror in the passing parade, passing parade
And in the end, all she'll be is your friend
Though passion's your lone desire, she's the one you can't touch
You want her so much, you're burnin', your heart's on fire
It takes a hard man to hold her, the challenge is forever on my mind
( * Repeat)Embed
