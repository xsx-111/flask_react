High On You LyricsThere you stood, that'll teach her
To look so good and feel so right
Let me tell you about
The girl I met last night
It's understood, I had to reach her
I let the wheel of fortune spin
I touched your hand before
The crowd started crashin' in
Now I'm higher than a kite
I know I'm getting hooked on your love
Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat
Beggin' for your touch
In the middle of the street
And I, I can't stop thinkin' about you, girl
I must be livin' in a fantasy world
I'm so high on you
Smart and coy, a little crazy
The kind of face that starts a fight
Let me tell you about
The girl I had last night
Piercin' eyes, like a raven
You seemed to share my secret sin
We were high before
The night started kickin' in
Now I'm screamin' in the night
I know I'm getting hooked on your love
Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat
Beggin' for your touch
In the middle of the street
And I, I can't stop thinkin' about you, girl
I must be livin' in a fantasy world
I've searched the whole world over
To find a heart so true
Such complete intoxication
I'm high on you
There you stood, that'll teach her
To look so good and feel so right
Let me tell you about
The girl I met last night
Now I'm higher than a kite
I know I'm getting hooked on your love
Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat
Beggin' for your touch
In the middle of the street
And I, I can't stop thinkin' about you, girl
I must be livin' in a fantasy world
I've searched the whole world over
To find a heart so true
Such complete intoxication
I'm high on you
I'm high on you
I'm high on youEmbed
