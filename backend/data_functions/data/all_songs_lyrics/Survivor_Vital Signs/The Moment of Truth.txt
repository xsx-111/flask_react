The Moment of Truth Lyrics
When you're alone, you ask yourself, what are you searching for?
Deep in the night, a dream is born, one that you can't ignore
If you think you can find the passion and you're ready to take a chance
If you really believe you can make it, then the power is in your own hands

It's the moment of truth, you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are
It's the moment of truth, it's all on the line
This is the place, this is the time
You've waited forever, it's now or it's never, nothing can stop you now

Once in your life, you make a choice, ready to risk it all
Deep in your soul, you hear a voice answering to the call
Though you know that it won't be easy, it's a promise you made for love
For the people that keep believing and the one that you're thinking of

It's the moment of truth, you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are
It's the moment of truth, it's all on the line
This is the place, this is the time
You've waited forever, it's now or it's never, nothing can stop you now
It's the moment of truth, you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are
It's the moment of truth, it's all on the line
This is the place, this is the time
You've waited forever, it's now or it's never, nothing can stop you now
It's the moment of truth, you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are
It's the moment of truth, it's all on the line
This is the place, this is the time
You've waited forever, it's now or it's never, nothing can stop you nowEmbed
