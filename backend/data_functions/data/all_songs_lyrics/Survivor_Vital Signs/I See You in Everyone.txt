I See You in Everyone LyricsEvery night
A fleeting glimpse of candlelight
Chases 'cross the atmosphere
But you're not here
And I see the shape
Of moonlight on the cityscape
But now the skyline wears a shroud
I hear your voice in every crowd
Listening for your footsteps in every hallway
Watching for your headlights around the bend
I can see you standing in every doorway
Out in the street
In every glance
I see your reflection
I fall in a trance
You can't know what you have done
I see you in everyone, in everyone
In the night I see your eyes
From every direction a different disguise
Can't you see what I've become
It's making me crazy, I see you in everyone*
Day by day, I watch the memories slip away
And traces of reality come back to me
Then I see your face, somewhere in a distant place
The fantasy has gone too far --
I close my eyes and there you are
I can see you standing in every doorway
I can feel your heartbeat -- I hear your voice
And hiding in my shadow you're with me alwaysEmbed
