High Command LyricsBones are feeling sleazy
Head spinning around
Spend the night with Josef Goebbels
Think I'm coming down
Life isn't easy
Thru having fun
Spent the night with Heimlich Himmler
Think I'm on the run
Always done the best
Of everything around
Flew the plane for Rudolph Hess
I've landed upside down
Always have to have
Something in my head
Shot cocaine with Hermann GÃ¶ring
Now I wish I was deadEmbed
