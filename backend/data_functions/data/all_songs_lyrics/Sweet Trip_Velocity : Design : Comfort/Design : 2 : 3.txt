Design : 2 : 3 LyricsReach for the sun
And miss the sunlight
Sing your song to the girl
And share the light
Reach for a breath
Don't mind to wait long
Living under your spell and the core of you
You are the core
You will share the light
Light away, it won't be long
You will share the light
Light away, it won't be long
You will share the light
Light away, it won't be long
You will share the light
We won't be together againEmbed
