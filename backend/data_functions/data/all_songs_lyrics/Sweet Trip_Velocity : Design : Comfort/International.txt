International Lyrics
You and me
We finally break free
From the mess we're in
The lies behind you
It could get better
I guess it's alright
Guess it's alright
You and me
To live the worst life
With a sense of guilt
At times it's faster
I'll write the letter
I guess it's just right
I'm feeling just fine

True
Only it's true
When you make me die in
Your hands
Run away from this parade
See
Faint and diseased
Would you make me die in
Your hands
Or run away from this charade
True
Only it's true
When you make me die in
Your hands
Run away from this parade
See
Faint and diseased
Would you make me die in
Your hands
Or run away from this charade
