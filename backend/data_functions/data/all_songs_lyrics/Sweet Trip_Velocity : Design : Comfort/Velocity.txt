Velocity Lyrics
I say you say
Intentions inventions
Intend to go down
(You go down on your way)
I feel you say
Come bring those intentions
Intentions to fly
(Come and rest at your place)
I say you say
Intentions inventions
Intend to go down
(You go down on your way)
They hear you say
Intentions inventions
Intend to progress
With your intentions to fly

I say you say
Intentions inventions
Intend to go down
(You go down on your way)
I feel you say
Come bring those intentions
Intentions to fly
(Come and rest at your place)
I say you say
Intentions inventions
Intend to go down
(You go down on your way)
They hear you say
Intentions inventions
Intend to progress
With your intentions to fly2Embed
