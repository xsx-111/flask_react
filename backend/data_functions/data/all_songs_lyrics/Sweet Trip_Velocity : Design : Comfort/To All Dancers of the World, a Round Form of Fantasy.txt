To All Dancers of the World, a Round Form of Fantasy Lyrics
Da da da da da da-da-da-da-da-da
Da da da da da da-da-da-da-da-da-da

You are ray of light
In the night sky and
You don't mind
When the light
Shines on your face
Maybe I
Wouldn't mind
To be graced by your
Gentle smile
Took the eyes
That kissed you softly there
Promenade
Hold my hand
Wait for I'll get my
Autograph
All our lives
In the snowy air

You're on your own (da-da-da-da)
You're on your own (da-da-da-da)
You're on your own (da-da-da-da)
You're on your own (da-da-da-da)
Ah Ahh Ahh
Turn away while you
Ah Ahh Ahh
Turn away while you
Ah Ahh Ahh
Turn away while you
Ah Ahh Ahh
Turn away while you
Ah Ahh Ahh
Turn away while you
Ah Ahh Ahh
Turn away while you
Ah Ahh Ahh
Turn away while you
Ah Ahh Ahh
Turn away while you1Embed
