Fruitcake and Cookies Lyrics
Maybe tears are endless
I need some refreshment
Just to cool my heart
Maybe honey's sweeter
When you take it deeper
Deeper all the time
Maybe tears are endless
I need some refreshment
Just to cool my heart
Maybe honey's sweeter
When you take it deeper
Deeper all the time
