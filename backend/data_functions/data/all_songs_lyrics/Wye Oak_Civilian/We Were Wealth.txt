We Were Wealth LyricsThough I am grown
I'm living like a child now
I wish, I want
Giving myself everything
Fearing the release
Keeping the peace
Say, for instance
I pay money for an object
Sight unseen
How is it that it speaks for me?
Borrowed, never earned
In debt from birth
Fill the
Days at
Any
Cost and
Spend your
Earnings
Ease the
Losses
We were
Wealth and
We were
Money
Of the
World and
Needing
NothingEmbed
