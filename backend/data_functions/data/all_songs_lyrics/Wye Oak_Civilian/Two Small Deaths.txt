Two Small Deaths LyricsTwo small deaths happened today
While I was at work
While I was at play
No less light darkens my door
So I cannot cry
Now what is that for?
Is this the way my mind works
Forwards, always forwards
Is this the way my brain waves
Backwards, sideways
I've no heart strong and as lasting
To miss and to mourn
The world at its passing
I'm saving up all of my strength
For when I finally fail
At keeping you safe
When my last friend should leave me
Slow and easy
I'll be creeping around them
Picking pocketsEmbed
