Fish LyricsThey who made you, they made me too
Quiet like you, violent like you
I see you there, wild in my dreams
When you return, go to the sea
Air is your permanent struggle to breathe
When you return, go to the sea
Gone, gone, gone, you were never alone
I'll come home and raise you up to what's left
Gone, gone
Ghost of your voice finally rests
Open your eyes now to all that is left
Don't be afraid now, you won't need me
You'll be at peace now, at last from the sea
You will forget eventually
The life that you wasted that led to the sea
Gone, gone, gone, you were never alone
I'll come home and raise you up to what's left
Gone, gone, gone, you were never alone
I'll come home and raise you up to what's left
Gone, gone
They who made you, they made me too
I say they can make us againEmbed
