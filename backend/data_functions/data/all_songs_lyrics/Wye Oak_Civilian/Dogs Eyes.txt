Dogs Eyes LyricsCan't see yourself in evolution
The history of our creation
So Dogs eyes
Smiling
Scare you about dying
I can't shake this superstition
Jesus, give me your permission
And God's eye looks in like a ghost
You don't believe in
Someone had me live this way
And I cannot get rid of it
Soft eyes, hard hands
To shovel the garden
A deep whole, a secret
In order to feed it
The season of calling
End to everyone knowing
Soft eyes, hard hands
To shovel the garden
A deep hole, a secret
In order to feed it
The season of calling
End to everyone knowing1Embed
