Doubt LyricsIf you should doubt
My heart
Remember this
That I would lie to you
If I believed it was
Right to do
If you should think
Instead
I would forget
All the lives I said
Were not meant for me
And meant for you
That would be the test
I could not forgive
Only that
To doubt the only way
That what was true before
Is true today
What I have learned
Of you
Does not assure
You bow before my will
But I believed it then
Believe it still
Oh, I believed it then
Believe it stillEmbed
