Hot as Day LyricsWhen the sun is its most bright
Stare into its light
Do not close your eyes
Let it burn into your mind
Then look left look right
Let it make you blind
Oh, isn't that a fright
Birth, to eternal night
That someone decides each day
When the days run long and late
Darkness brings me pause
While I lie awake
Sleeping's never long enough
Lying in this heat
I forget to breathe
Oh, isn't that the way
Sun hides himself away
Still, it's hot as dayEmbed
