The Catalyst Lyrics
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no!

And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young? No!
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young? No!
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light!
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!


Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
It can't be outfought, it can't be outdone (Lift me up, let me go)
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone (Lift me up)
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone (Lift me up, let me go)
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone (Lift me up, let me go)
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun28Embed
