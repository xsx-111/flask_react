Robot Boy Lyrics
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

You say you're not gonna fight
'Cause no one will fight for you
And you think there's not enough love
And no one to give it to
And you're sure you've hurt for so long
You've got nothing left to lose
So, you say you're not gonna fight
'Cause no one will fight for you

You say the weight of the world
Has kept you from letting go
And you think compassion's a flaw
And you'll never let it show
And you're sure you've hurt in a way
That no one will ever know
But someday, the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go

Whoa-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh
Da-yeah-nah, no-ooh-oh
No, no
Hold on, the weight of the world (Na, no, no, no, no oh)
(Oh-ho, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Will give you the strength to go (Yeah, yeah, aah)
(Yeah, no)
So hold on, the weight of the world (Yeah-aah, yeah, yeah)
Will give you the strength to go (Nah, ha, ha, ha) (No-oh, no-oh)
(Ha ha ha ha, yah, yah, yah) (No-oh, no-oh)
(No-oh)
So hold on, the weight of the world (Ah, yeah)
Will give you the strength to go (Mah, mah, mah)

(Hold on, hold on, hold on)
Just hold on, the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go11Embed
