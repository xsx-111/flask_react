Catch Me Lyrics
Extracurricular, parallel to none, I am perpendicular
Hit 'em with the, "Oh, now, that's just ridiculous"
We coulda cleared up all these particulars
That coulda been the homicide, vehicular
You wasn't in no state to speed off
You was buggin' out, yeah, you was peed off
We was just chillin' up at the ski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you tellin' me we off
Your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call
That's the effect they call a snowball
Next thing you know, I was runnin' down the hall
Sayin' "Please come back, I have given my all"
I have given my all
Funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for ya
I'm waitin' on you, waitin', boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm waitin' for you, waitin', boy
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me, catch me)
You wanted oh-so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me concur
That maybe I shoulda never taken you from her
But with all of the aforementioned
I am still trapped in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waiting
'Cause I am in need of more attention
Coulda called back just to say sum'
I'ma fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination
I'm not doin' well, exclamation
You succeeded at your attempts to make me
Need you desperately to vindicate me
It's funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for ya
I'm waitin' on you, waitin', boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm waitin' for you, waitin', boy
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me, catch me)
Okay
Oh, oh, oh, okay
Oh, oh, oh, okay
It's, it's whatever you say, ayy, ayy
It's whatever you say, ayy, ayy
I am at your disposal

My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for ya
I'm waitin' on you, waitin', boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm waitin' for you, waitin', boy
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me, catch me)5Embed
