Dead Man Walking Lyrics
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a Dead Man walking, walking, walking
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a Dead Man
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a dead man walking, walking, walking
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a Dead Man

I see you standing there, but you're already gone
I'm holding your hand, but you're barely holding on
I'm kissing your lips, but it just don't feel the same
Am I dead man now, left living with the blame?

Oh, I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a dead man walking, walking, walking

Already broken, already gone
Already know you're moving on
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead man, walking
Already see it in your face
Already someone in my place
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead man, walking
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a dead man walking, walking, walking
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a dead man

We're in the same room just one million miles away
With all these books around, but we ain't got two words to say
Am I a dead man now, left living with the shame?
I'm

Already broken, already gone
Already know you're moving on
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead Man, walking
Already see it in your face
Already someone in my place
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead Man, walking
(Yeah. Ooooh-oooooh)
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead Man, walking
Yeah
(Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking (I hear the angels)
Now I'm a dead man walking, walking, walking (I hear the angels)
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking (I hear the angels)
Now I'm a dead man (I hear the angels)

Already broken, already gone
Already know you're moving on
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead Man, walking
Already see it in your face
Already someone in my place
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead man, walking (Dead Man Walking. Yeah.)
(Ooooh-oooooh)
(Yeah.)
I'm a breathing, talking (I'm a Dead Man walking, a dead man walking)
Dead Man, walking
(Ooooh-oooooh)
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead Man, walking (I'm a dead man walking, a dead man walking. Yeah.)

I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a Dead Man walking, walking, walking
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a Dead Man
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a Dead Man walking, walking, walking
I hear the angels talking, talking, talking
Now I'm a Dead Man
Now I'm a Dead Man4Embed
