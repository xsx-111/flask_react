Long Gone and Moved On Lyrics
When’s the day you start again
And when the hell does "you’ll get over it" begin
I’m looking hard in the mirror but I don’t fit my skin
It’s too much to take, it’s too hard to break me from the cell I’m in

Oh, from this moment on
I’m changing the way I feel, yeah
From this moment on
It’s time to get real

'Cause I still don’t know how to act, don’t know what to say
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday
But you’re long gone and moved on
But you’re long gone
But I still don’t know where to start, still finding my way
Still talk about you like it was yesterday
But you’re long gone and moved on
But you’re long gone, you moved on

So how’d you pick the pieces up?
Yeah
I’m barely used to saying "me" instead of "us"
The elephant in the room keeps scaring off the guests
It gets under my skin to see you with him and it's not me that you’re with
Oh, from this moment on
I’m changing the way I feel, yeah
From this moment on
It’s time to get real

'Cause I still don’t know how to act, don’t know what to say
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday
But you’re long gone and moved on
But you’re long gone
But I still don’t know where to start, still finding my way
Still talk about you like it was yesterday
But you’re long gone and moved on
But you’re long gone, you moved on

No, I can’t keep thinking that you’re coming back, no
'Cause I got no business knowing where you’re at, no
And it's gonna be hard, yeah, cause I have to wanna heal, yeah
And it's gonna be hard, yeah, the way I feel
But I have to get real

I still don’t know how to act, don’t know what to say
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday
But you’re long gone and moved on
But you’re long gone
But I still don’t know where to start, still finding my way
Still talk about you like it was yesterday
But you’re long gone and moved on
But you’re long gone, you moved on
But you’re long gone, you moved on
Eh eh, oh oh
Eh eh, oh oh
But you’re long gone, you moved onEmbed
