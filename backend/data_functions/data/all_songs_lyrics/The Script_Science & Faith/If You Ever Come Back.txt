If You Ever Come Back Lyrics
If you're standing with your suitcase
But you can't step on the train
Everything's the way that you left it, I still haven't slept yet
And if you're covering your face now
But you just can't hide the pain
Still setting two plates on the counter
But eating without 'cha
If the truth is you're a liar
When you say that you're okay
I'm sleepin on your side of the bed, goin' out of my head now
And if you're out there try'na move on
But somethin' pulls you back again
I'm sitting here tryin' to persuade you
Like you're in the same room

And I wish you could give me the cold shoulder
And I wish you could still give me a hard time
And I wish I could still wish it was over
But even if wishing is a waste of time
Even if I never cross your mind

I'll leave the door on the latch
If you ever come back if you ever come back
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
If you ever come back
There'll be a smile on my face and the kettle on
And it will be just like you were never gone
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
If you ever come back if you ever come back now
Oh if you ever come back if you ever come back now
Now they say I'm wasting my time
Cause you're never coming home
But they used to say the world was flat
But how wrong was that now
And by leaving my door open
I'm risking everythin' I own
There's nothin' I can lose in a break-in
That you haven't taken

And I wish you could give me the cold shoulder
And I wish you could still give me a hard time
And I wish I could still wish it was over
But even if wishing is a waste of time
Even if I never cross your mind

I'll leave the door on the latch
If you ever come back if you ever come back
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
If you ever come back
There'll be a smile on my face and the kettle on
And it will be just like you were never gone
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
If you ever come back if you ever come back now
If you ever come back if you ever come back now
If it's the fighting you remember
Or the little things you miss
I know you're out there somewhere
So just remember this
If it's the fighting you remember
Or the little things you miss
Oh just remember this, oh just remember this

I'll leave the door on the latch
If you ever come back if you ever come back
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
If you ever come back
There'll be a smile on my face and the kettle on
And it will be just like you were never gone
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
If you ever come back if you ever come back now
Oh if you ever come back if you ever come back
And it will be just like you were never gone
And it will be just like you were never gone
And it will be just like you were never gone
If you ever come back if you ever come back now9Embed
