This = Love Lyrics
It's in the eyes of our children
As they leave for the very first time
It's in the heart of a soldier
As he takes the bullet on the front line
It's in the face of a mother
As she takes the force of the blow
And it's in the hands of a father (yeah)
As he works his fingers to the bone (yeah)

I'm standing under a white flag, oh
Can you see me? (oh)
Can you see me? (oh)
I'm standing for everything we have, oh
Can you hear me? (oh)
Can you hear me?

This is why we do it
This is worth the pain
This is why we fall down and get back up again
This is where the heart lies
This is from above
Love is this
This is love
Love is why we do it
Love is worth the pain
Love is why we fall down and get back up again
Love is where the heart lies
Love is from above
Love is this
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love

It's in the soul of a city
What it does after it crumbles and burns
And it's in the blood of a hero
To know where he goes,he may never return (yeah)

I'm standing under a white flag, oh
Can you see me? (oh)
Can you see me? (oh)
I'm standing for everything we have, oh
Can you hear me? (oh)
Can you hear me?

This is why we do it
This is worth the pain
This is why we fall down and get back up again
This is where the heart lies
This is from above
Love is this
This is love
Love is why we do it
Love is worth the pain
Love is why we fall down and get back up again
Love is where the heart lies
Love is from above
Love is this
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
(Whoa yeah)

If you could be
Anywhere that you wanted be
With anyone that you wanted to be with
Doing anything that you wanted to do
What would it be, man, and who would it be with you?
Time flies but you're the pilot
It moves real fast but you're the driver
It may crash and burn sometimes

This is why we do it
This is worth the pain
This is why we fall down and get back up again
This is where the heart lies
This is from above
Love is this
This is love
Love is why we do it
Love is worth the pain
Love is why we fall down and get back up again
Love is where the heart lies
Love is from above
Love is this
This is love
This is love2Embed
