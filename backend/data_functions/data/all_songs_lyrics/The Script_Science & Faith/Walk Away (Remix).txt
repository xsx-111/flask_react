Walk Away (Remix) Lyrics
I don't know why she's with me
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me
If I was her, by now I woulda left me
I woulda walked away by now
Broken away somehow, I swear she forgave me
She said a woman's gotta do what she gotta do
Even if it means she denied herself the truth (Yeah)
'Cause when you're in too deep you wake up when it's too late

You've fallen in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now, then you'll stay (Yeah)
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me (Yo)
So walk away

So if you want then I suggest you walk
Why are we up this hour, knockin' pictures off the wall?
Tell me, what does that resolve? I guess it's my fault
The truth is never easy when you gotta get it off
And girl I'm so exhausted, yes, all this makes me nauseous
This is just the way that I am, you cannot alter it
I'm sorry that I couldn't be your fantasy
If this ain't what you want then you should leave
But still she stays (walk away, walk away)
But still she stays

She's standing in the heart of darkness
Saying "I know you got a soul, even though you're heartless"
How could any woman in their right mind, be so blind
To find something to save?
'Stead of walking with me, she shoulda walked away
She finds colour in the darkest places
She finds beauty in the saddest of faces
For such a clued in, headstrong city girl
Coulda had the world, but

You've fallen in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now, then you'll stay
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me
So walk away

As I fall a thousand miles an hour, downward
Now that you're gone, I guess it's true, words have power
I guess what I said left a taste so sour
In your mouth you wanted me to see what life's like without you
And so I lay awake watchin' DVDs
Season one, season two, even season three
I'm sorry that I couldn't be inside your fantasy
But if this ain't what you want then you should leave
But still she stays (walk away, walk away)
You should leave
But still she stays (walk away, walk away)

I don't know why she's with me
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me
If I was her, by now I woulda left me
I woulda walked away by now

But you've fallen in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now, then you'll stay
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me
So walk away

So if you want then I suggest you walk
(So walk away, walk away, walk away)
So if you want then I suggest you walk
(So walk away, walk away, walk away)
And girl I'm so exhausted, yes, all this makes me nauseous
This is just the way that I am, you cannot alter it
I'm sorry that I couldn't be your fantasy
If this ain't what you want, then you should leave
But still she stays (walk away, walk away)
But still she stays (walk away, walk away)
So if you want then I suggest you walk
Walk away (walk away, walk away)
I say you walk away (walk away, walk away)
But still she stays
But still she stays
Yeah, she stays
She stays2Embed
