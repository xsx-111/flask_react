Journey from Mariabronn LyricsTwo began together, lived as one
Each one to the other had become
More than a friend, living to meet a common end
They were true, each one knew all is well
Still the elder knew it could not last
Hidden memories from the young one's past
Drew them apart
Both knew that deep within his heart they must part
Each their own separate way
It puzzles me how we can be so close and yet worlds apart
Can it be, my memory has torn my life in two
From the very start
I screamed for the devil to let me be
I called to the heavens to set me free
Today I prayed for the answer and not one
Of the gods in the sky would rescue me
Dreams of fortune fill the young one's mind
Learn the worldly ways of hope to find
Love on the way, searching to find the light of day
In his soul he had found his own way
But to each other they soon will return
Destiny fulfilled, their words will burn an eternal flameEmbed
