Summer Song (Wishing You Were Here) LyricsEverybody needs a by the sea affair
Where you get the urge from something in the air
Helter Skelter on a mat "Kiss me Quick" is on my hat
And you do it on the ghost train for a dare
Wishing you were here same as every year
'cos our summer madness is too short
Wishing you were here Where the sunshine's near
Is it true that wishes can be bought?
Everybody needs the moonlight on the beach
Where the water's cold and no one hears you screech
Getting buried in the sand what you holding in your hand
Let it go or else I'll keep it out of reach
The last night you dressed to kill
Will you write? You say you will
Sometimes hopes just fade away
Everybody needs to have a sea romance
When the world around just doesn't stand a chance
Candy floss stuck on your nose and you donkey's name was Rose
What's this cheek to cheek in every single dance?Embed
