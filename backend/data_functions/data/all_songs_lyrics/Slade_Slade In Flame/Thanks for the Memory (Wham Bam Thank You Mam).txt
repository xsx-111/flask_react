Thanks for the Memory (Wham Bam Thank You Mam) LyricsComo estas chickadee?
Have a housemaid on your knee
Eat an apple ev'ry day
An onion keeps ev'ryone away
Have an athlete on your feet
Have some honey with your meat Eat an apple ev'ry day
The doctor has got to keep away
He'll tell you
Thanks for the mem'ry
Thanks for it all
Wham bam
Thank you malm
Thanks for the ball
Have a burgular alarm
Have a milkmaid on your farm
Can you raise a ballyhoo
If only there's nothing else to do
Have some butter with your fly
They sald bananas could get you high
Eat an apple ev'ry day
The doctor has got to earn his pay
He'll tell you
. . 
Como estas chickadee?
Tap the water on your knee
Eat an apple ev'ry day
The doctor has got to keep away
He'll tell you
