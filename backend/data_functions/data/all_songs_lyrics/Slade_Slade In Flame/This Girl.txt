This Girl LyricsThis girl ain't flying tonight this girl ain't trying tonight
She's only turning over
That's what makes a rover think he ain't doin' it right
This girl ain't giving her best this girl ain't living her best
She's only going under
That's what makes me wonder who she'll be pickin' on next
Happy hunting all you sweet sinners all you losers
All you winners, find your own peace of mind
Happy hunting all you live wires
All you laughers, all you criers, am I really unkind?
This girl ain't doing the rounds, this girl's become out of bounds;
She's only letting new loves
That's what makes the true loves think that she's out for the pounds
This girl ain't doing her all, this girl ain't bouncing her ball;
She's only out to plunder
That's what makes me wonder If I should give her a call
This girl ain't flying tonight, this girl ain't trying tonight;
She's only letting new loves
That's what makes the true loves think they ain't doing it rightEmbed
