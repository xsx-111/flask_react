How Does It Feel? LyricsHow does it feel, runnin' around, 'round, 'round?
How does it feel, watching from upside down?
'Cause many years from now there will be new sensations
And new temptations, how does it feel?
How does it feel, right at the start?
And how does it feel, when you are thrown apart?
'Cause many years from now there will be new elations
And new frustrations, how does it feel?
Do you know, know, know what it's like
To be searchin' in your own time?
All your attempting, experimenting - all on the climb
Do you know, know, know what it's like
To be searching and suddenly find
All your illusion, all your confusion - all left behind?
How does it feel turnin' away?
And how does it feel facing another day?
'Cause many years from now there will be newer poisons
And new horizons, how does it feel?
Do you know, know, know what it's like
To be searchin' in your own time?
All your attempting, experimenting - all on the climb
Do you know, know, know what it's like
To be searching and suddenly find
All your illusion, all your confusion - all left behind?
'Cause many years from now there will be new tomorrows
And still some sorrows, how does it feel?
Do you know, know, know what it's like
To be searchin' in your own time?
All your attempting, experimenting - all on the climb
Do you know, know, know what it's like
To be searching and suddenly find
All your illusion, all your confusion - all left behind?Embed
