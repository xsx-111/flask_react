Heaven Knows LyricsCaught between the jungle and the stars
Caught inside a valley full of bars
There's a twinkle of hope over there
There's a smell of success in the air
Who can say where the better wind blows
I suppose, I suppose, heaven knows heaven knows
Caught up in a happy masquerade
Living out the parts that fate has made
There's a greener grass over the hill
There's a bigger cup ready to fill
Who can say...
It's all a never ending game to play
Say what you mean, mean what you say Don't lie;
It's all a never ending game to play; the circle turns ev'ryday
Locked inside the cage where you were born
Ending with a technicolour yawn
There's a smell of success in the air
There are moments you're ready to share
Who can say...
Caught between the jungle and the stars
Caught inside a valley full of bars
So get out and get over the hill
There's a twinkle of hope waiting still
Who can say...Embed
