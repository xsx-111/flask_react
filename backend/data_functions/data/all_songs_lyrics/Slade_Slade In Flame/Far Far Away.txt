Far Far Away Lyrics
I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi
I've seen the bridges of the world and they're for real

I've had a red light off-the-wrist
Without me even gettin' kissed
It still seems so unreal

I've seen the morning in the mountains of Alaska
I've seen the sun set in the East and in the West

I've sang the glory that was Rome
And passed the "Hound Dog" singer's home
It still seems for the best

And I'm far far away
With my head up in the clouds
And I'm far far away
With my feet down in the crowds
Lettin' loose around the world
But the call of home is loud
Still as loud
I've seen the Paris lights from high upon Montmartre
And felt the silence hanging low in No Man's Land
And though those Spanish nights were fine
It wasn't only from the wine
It still seems all in hand

And I'm far far away
With my head up in the clouds
And I'm far far away
With my feet down in the crowds
Lettin' loose around the world
But the call of home is loud
Still as loud

I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi
The Grand Bahama Island stories carry on

And though those arigato smiles
Stay in your memory for a while
There still seems more to come

And I'm far far away
With my head up in the clouds
And I'm far far away
With my feet down in the crowds
Lettin' loose around the world
But the call of home is loud
Still as loud
And I'm far far away
With my head up in the clouds
And I'm far far away
With my feet down in the crowds
And I'm far far away
But the sound of home is loud
Still as loud1Embed
