O.K. Yesterday Was Yesterday LyricsBoys get tight ooh what a sight ready to use their charms
Girls just might stay out all night ain't gonna do 'em no harm
Lady Luck will do what she oughta - no place left to lock up your daughter
No way out time's getting shorter - makin' sure your life carries on
I say O.K. Yesterday was yesterday - I say O.K. today's a better day
I say O.K. Yesterday was yesterday - I say O.K. today's a better day
All young boys play with their toys, call it a teddy bear
Girls instead take theirs to bed to keep it from getting scared
Lady Luck will do what she oughta - no place left to lock up your daughter
No way out time's getting shorter; makin' sure your life carries on
Boys get tight out for a fight, love kickin' up a din
Girls just might know how to bite hug 'em and they'll soon give in
Lady Luck will do what she oughta - No place left to lock up your daughter
O way out time's getting shorter - makin' sure your life carries on
O.K. Yesterday was yesterday - I say O.K. today's a better dayEmbed
