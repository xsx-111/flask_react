Raining in My Champagne LyricsYeah!
I got a hole burnin' in my pocket, I got a geetar that wants to rock
I got a tune an' I wanna sock it with electrical shock, yeah … hey hey hey hey
I got some ants in my pants an' they're a-jumpin'
I've gotta get a shot of rhythm 'n' blues
I've got some hot stuff inside an' it's a-pumpin'
Down to my shoes, yay yay
It's raining down on me champagne (it's raining champagne)
Let it rain, let it rain (let it rain, let it rain)
It's raining, raining, raining champagne (it's raining, raining, rainin')
It's gettin' into my brain, let it rain in my brain, again … again … again
I've got some soul burnin' in my pocket - I've got a hard workin' ol' mojo
I've got a geetar an' I wanna rock it - So come on let's go, go … go ho ho ho
Now there are some think it's mindless bashin' an' there are some who we'll never get to
An' there are some who really like it crashin' - How about you, you … you ?
It's raining down on me champagne (it's raining champagne)
Let it rain, let it rain (let it rain, let it rain)
It's raining, raining, raining champagne (it's raining, raining, rain, yeah)
It's gettin' into my brain, let it rain in my brain
Again… again … again … again … again … again … again
I've got a hole burnin' in my pocket, Got a geetar an' I wanna rock it
I 've got a tune an' I wanna sock it with electrical shock, yeah … yeah
It's raining down on me champagne (it's raining champagne)
Let it rain, let it rain (let it rain, let it rain)
It's raining, raining, raining champagne (it's raining, raining, rain, yeah)
It's gettin' into my brain, let it rain in my brain
Again… again … again … again … again … again …
It's raining down on me champagne (it's raining champagne)
Let it rain, let it rain (let it rain, let it rain)
It's raining, raining, raining, raining (it's raining, raining, rain, yeah)
It's gettin' into my brain, let it rain in my brain
Again… again … again … again … again … again…
It's raining down on me champagne (it's raining champagne)
Let it rain, let it rain (let it rain, let it rain)
It's raining, raining, raining, raining, raining champagne (it's raining, raining, rain, yeah)
It's gettin' into my brain, let it rain in my brain
Again… again … again … again … again … again … again … again …
… again … again … again … again … again … again … again …Embed
