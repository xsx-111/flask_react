So Far So Good LyricsFor twenty odd years I've taken everything that's bad
For twenty odd years I've wanted things I've never had
Oh was it all in the mind?
Is it living the life of a King making the best out of everything
So far, so good doing what we could
Taking chances, those chances, and I'm alive
So far, so good doing what we should
Taking chances, those chances, and I'm alive
For twenty odd years I've been working hard to have my say
And now that it's here the fantasy has worn away
Oh was it all in the mind?
Is it living on Paradise Row making the best out of having a go
Oh was it all...Embed
