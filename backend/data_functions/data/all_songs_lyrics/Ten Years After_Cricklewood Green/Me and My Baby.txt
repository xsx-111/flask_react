Me and My Baby LyricsMe and my baby never get the blues
Me and my baby never get the blues
Me and my woman got nothing left to lose
Me and my baby never get uptight
Me and my baby never get uptight
Me and my woman never do a damn thing right
Me and my baby always feeling good
Me and my baby always feeling good
We love each other, sure no reason why we should
Me and my baby really got it made
Me and my baby really got it made
I get her loving when the other man is paid
Me and my baby living like we should
Me and my baby living like we should
We don't act bad 'cause we don't know what it's like to be goodEmbed
