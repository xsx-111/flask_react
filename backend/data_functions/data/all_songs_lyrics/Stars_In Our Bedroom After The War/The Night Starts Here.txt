The Night Starts Here Lyrics
The night starts here, the night starts here
Forget your name, forget your fear
The night starts here, the night starts here
Forget your name, forget your fear

The pleasure part, the afterthought
The missing stone in the graveyard
The time we have, the task at hand
The love it takes to become a man
The dust at dawn is rained upon, attaches itself to everyone
No one is spared, no one is clean
It travels places you've never been or seen before

The night starts here, the night starts here
Forget your name, forget your fear
The night starts here, the night starts here
Forget your name, forget your fear
You drop a coin into the sea
And shout out, "Please come back to me"
You name your child after your fear
And tell them "I have brought you here"

The pleasure part, the aftershock
The moment that it takes to fall apart
The time we have, the task at hand
The love it takes to destroy a man
The ecstasy, the being free
That big black cloud over you and me
And after that, the upwards fall
And were we angels after all?
I don't know, I don't know
The night starts here, the night starts here
Forget your name, forget your fear
The night starts here, the night starts here
Forget your name, forget your fear
You drop a coin into the sea
And shout out, "Please come back to me"
You name your child after your fear
And tell them "I have brought you here"

The night starts here, the night starts here
The scary part, the aftershock
Forget your name, forget your fear
The moment that it takes to fall apart
The night starts here, the night starts here
The time we have, the task at hand
Forget your name, forget your fear
The love it takes to destroy a man
You drop a coin into the sea
The ecstasy, the being free
And shout out, "Please come back to me"
That big black cloud over you and me
You name your child after your fear
And after that, the upwards fall
And tell them I have brought you here
And were we angels after all?
The night starts here, the night starts here
I don't know, I don't know
Forget your name, forget your fear
I don't know
The night starts here, the night starts here
Forget your name, forget your fear
You drop a coin into the sea
And shout out, "Please come back to me"
You name your child after your fear
And tell them I have brought you here1Embed
