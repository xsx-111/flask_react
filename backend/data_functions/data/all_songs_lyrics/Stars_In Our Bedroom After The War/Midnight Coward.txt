Midnight Coward Lyrics
Sweetness, sweetness never suits me
When I get up to take you home
Maybe it's love, love at first slightly drunk
Now I'm walking with the sun in my mouth
Worry, worry is a well
Gonna let it fall tonight from where we stand

What can't be decided
In the morning it will bring itself to you
I can see what's coming, but I'm not saying it

Sickness, weakness at the thought, of how you're going to play
How long should I stay?
Promises, promises never cease to assist it
And now I'm back on my back, please bite your word
Hurry, hurry to believe
I can always trust, as much as you deceive

What can't be decided
In the morning it will bring itself to you
I can see what's coming, but I'm not saying it
What's your middle name? How do you play the game?
I'll be the first to leave
When did I grow up? I don't want to say too much
I'll be the first to leave

What can't be decided
In the morning it will bring itself to you
What can't be decided
Can fool you into thinking maybe you can choose
I can see what's coming
I can see what's coming
I can see what's coming
But I'm not saying it1Embed
