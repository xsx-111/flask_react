Life 2: The Unhappy Ending Lyrics
(Scene one)
Late at night interior, we find ourselves inside the car
Our hero has just gone too far
His lover bleeding in the back
He removes the Lucky from the pack
He knows now that he can't turn back
(Cut to)
The cherry lights in the rear view
He realizes that he's through
Whispers, "Darling, let's have fun"
Hits the exit doing 91
Drives until he's in the woods
If he loses them he's gone for good

Life was supposed to be a film
Was supposed to be a thriller
Was supposed to end in tears
But life could be nothing but a joke, could be nothing but a con
Where's my unhappy ending gone?
Oh, life was supposed to be a film
Was supposed to be a thriller
Was supposed to end in fire
But life could be nothing but a joke, a sentimental little con
Where's my unhappy ending gone?
Where's my unhappy ending?
Here is the part where you save me
Here is the scene where you save the day
Why can't the ending be happy?
Why must it always resolve this way?

(Fade in)
A cabin in the woods somewhere
Our hero strokes his lover's hair
Says "Don't worry love, we're almost done"
Says "I could have really been someone"
Outside, they surround the house with pistols drawn
It's a waiting game until the dawn
Sergeant says, "He can't go on;
We know now that he can't go on"

Life was supposed to be a film
Was supposed to be a thriller
Was supposed to end in blood
But life could be nothing but a joke, a sentimental little con
Where's my unhappy ending gone?
Oh, life was supposed to be a film
Was supposed to be a thriller
Was supposed to end in fire
But life; turns out it's nothing but a dream
And that I'll miss it when it's gone
I want the story to go on and on and on and on...
But it can't go on...
But it can't go on...
But it can't go on...
But it can't go on...
But it can't go on...
But it can't go on...Embed
