My Favourite Book Lyrics
I was always late, you never afraid, that we could be falling
Falling
All our friends would say, that maybe we should wait, but they can't see what's coming
Coming
And to this day, when everything breaks, you are the anchor that holds me

And that is why we'll always make it

How I know your face, all the ways you move
You come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone to make me come alive

When the days are long, and the thunder with the storm, can always get me crying
Crying
You can make my bed, I'll fall into it, shattered but not lonely
Lonely
'Cause I never knew a home, until I found your hands
And when I'm weathered
You come to me, you're my best friend
And that is why we'll always make it

How I know your face, all the ways you move, you come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone to make me come alive

And when we're making love
I'd give up everything up for your touch

How I know your face, all the ways you move
You come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone to make me come alive

When you go to work all the day I wait
For you to come home, recount our time, in our little place
Our little place, our little place
Our little place, our little place, our little place1Embed
