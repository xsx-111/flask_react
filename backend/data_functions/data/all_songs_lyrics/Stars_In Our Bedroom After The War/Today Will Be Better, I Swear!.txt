Today Will Be Better, I Swear! Lyrics
The only problem with going to bed is that you have to wake up in the morning

When you can't get up to the cold morning light
But you don't get to sleep in, still dreaming
And everybody only wants to fight
You're up against never being right
When the worries of the world hold your feet
And there's little left to believe in

Today, today
It's gonna be a better one
There's nothing more to take in, going wrong
Today, today
It's gonna be a better one
There's nothing more to take in, going wrong
There's nothing more to take in, going wrong

Old pale memories of someone you knew
Keep crawling through the back of your mind, stealing time
And in the daylight, you're crossing all your wires
You never knew just how to put out a fire
The closet's been shaking with bones
Little reminders that you're out on your own
Today, today
It's gonna be a better one
There's nothing more to take in, going wrong
Today, today
It's gonna be a better one
There's nothing more to take in, going wrong
There's nothing more to take in, going wrong
Today, today
Keep your head and drop the gun
There's nothing more to battle when you're gone
Today, today
It's gonna be a better one
There's nothing more to take in, going wrong
There's nothing more to take in, going wrong
