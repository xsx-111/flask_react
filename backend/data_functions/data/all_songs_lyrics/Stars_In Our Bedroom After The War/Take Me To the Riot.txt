Take Me To the Riot Lyrics
Grey skies and light fading
Headlamps making patterns on the wall
Uptown it's dead now but
Out here no one seems to care at all
Slick girls and sick boys and
Each one lining up to take it home
They hold tight their coin and
They pray no one has to see them fall
I'm there, yeah, I serve them
The one with the empty-looking eyes
Come closer, you'll see me:
The face that is used to telling lies

Saturday nights in neon lights
Sunday in the cell
Pills enough to make me feel ill
Cash enough to make me well
Take me, take me to the riot
Take me, take me to the riot
Take me, take me to the riot
Take me, take me to the riot
Take me

You sprung me, I'm grateful
I love when you tell me not to speak
I owe you but I know you
You'll have me back but it's gonna take a week
What now kid? Which way love?
Will we ever make up and be friends?
Good news is my shoes is
Lined with all my nickels and my tens
Let's do them, Just feed me
I hate when I have to get to sleep
You despise me and I love you
It's not much but it's just enough to keep
Saturday nights in neon lights
Sunday in the cell
Pills enough to make me feel ill
Cash enough to make me well
Take me, take me to the riot
Take me, take me to the riot
Take me, take me to the riot
Take me, take me to the riot
Take me

And let me stay
And let me stay
Let me stay
Let me, let me stay2Embed
