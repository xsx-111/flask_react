The Ghost of Genova Heights Lyrics
He hoped to be remembered as the one
Who told his men to turn back
And go where we'd begun
Roses are the flower he would prefer
Scatter all his ashes on the pier

Genova Heights, Genova Heights
Are hard to leave, are hard to leave
The bedroom lights of Genova Heights
Are hard to leave, are hard to leave

You did wrong that you thought was good
And now you're back in the neighborhood
I see you when I never should
Now you're back in the neighborhood
You, you did wrong that you thought was good
And now you're back in the neighborhood
I always see you when I never should
Now you're back, now you're back in the neighborhood

He taps upon the glass when I'm asleep
So now I keep my window closed at night
S.O.S. in Morse code when the wind blows
He is waiting for his moment to be right
Genova Heights, Genova Heights
Are hard to leave, are hard to leave
The endless nights of Genova Heights
Are hard to leave, so hard to leave

You did wrong that you thought was good
And now you're back in the neighborhood
I always see you when I never should
Now you're back in the neighborhood
You, you did wrong that you thought was good
And now you're back in the neighborhood
I always see you when I never should
Now you're back, now you're back in the neighborhood
