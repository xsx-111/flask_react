Window Bird Lyrics
Stuck on the wall, the note that you left
I wait and stall for the moment
Your reckless heart, you know you got it
Into the past, I try to sort it
Sort it, sort it, sort it
Sort it, sort it, sort it

Out of the fog, a colder morning
I wanted to call for nothing
Your careless heart, you know you got it
I crawl into bed and try to forget
Forget, forget, forget
Forget, forget, forget

When we go down, you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious
When we go down, you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious

Blanket of cloud, the sky hovering
The winter is long and forgiving
You melt your doubt and fall into me
I find your mouth and try to hold it
Hold it, hold it, hold it
Hold it, hold it, hold it
You blame your love, you know is harmless
We're both wise for falling
The summer arrives, the gardens alive
With the mud and mortar, we're going to save it
Save it, save it
Save it, save it
Save it, save it
Save it, save it
Save it, save it
Save it, save it
Save it, save it

When we go down, you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious
When we go down, you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious
When we go down, you lost the courage
When you want to go
You can't get out through the back door
When we go down, you're so ferocious
When you're going to leave
Wait out fear and look for me
When we go down, you lost the courage
When you want to go
You can't get out through the back door
When we go down, you're so ferocious
When you're going to leave
Wait out fear and look for meEmbed
