Service Road Lyrics
You should really call your brother
Someone put up a picture where he can't stand
He’s holding onto the table
Probably throwing darts or playing cards
Something that he lost made him so mad
Always said it didn't matter
With a pile of filthy coins clenched in his hands
Asking strangers to forgive him
But he never told them what it is
He did to them that made him feel so bad

Say what you mean and say it now
Don't state your name, that doesn’t count
Who are you?
Who are you
Looking for?

Thought that he was doing better
A notice of final eviction, he just laughs
Always had a sense of humor
Still joking 'til the bitter end
Well, all those threats he made, can't walk them back
In and out of indecision
In and out of any options he once had
Farewell, so long
'Til the trouble that you made and hate is gone
Say what you mean and say it now
Don't throw a fit, quit acting out
Who are you, who are you
Waiting for?

Just go out into the fallin' snow
Just go towards the white in the skylight
Just go past the trucks on the service road
Just go until you feel differentEmbed
