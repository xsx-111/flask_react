Exception to the Rule Lyrics
You need an occupation
To warrant a vacation
Without anticipation
Nothing's satisfactory
I came out here to check out
Get away from my house
Now I don't leave this couch
Or turn off the TV

There's always an exemption
There's always an exception to the rule
Always an exemption
There's always an exception to the rule
Why don't you want it?
Why don't you want it anymore?
Why don't you want it?
Why don't you want it anymore?

I wanted to avoid it
Live out in the forest
Stay out of that orbit
Go drifting out to sea
But fate just wouldn't have it
The street just like a magnet
Mends my broken habits
And makes a fool of me
There's always an exemption
There's always an exception to the rule
Always an exemption
There's always an exception to the rule
Why don't you want it?
Why don't you want it anymore?
Why don't you want it?
Why don't you want it anymore?

Nice sentiment
Not this again
Quit tapping on my window (Back in just a minute)
Won't let you in
I'm not listening
'Cause I know where that talk goes

And I don't want it
And I don't want it anymore
And I don't want it
And I don't want it anymore1Embed
