Big Black Heart Lyrics
Your black hair is red
I laughed when I saw your chest, you shook your head and
Pulled the curtains back, took in the view
Then you showed me the rest of you

And then I guess I thought I'd see the world
I guess I thought I would see the world

Your black heart is big
I'd ask you to cross but you'd never do it, but then again
You stopped in the middle of the street just to kiss me

And I thought you'd stopped the world
I guess I thought you could stop the world

Alright, alright for now
Don't wanna think about it
I'm fine with hiding out
Alright, alright for now
I'll wrap my head around it
Make room for something else
Alright, alright for now
Don't wanna think about it
I'm fine with hiding out
Alright, alright for now
I'll wrap my head around it
Make room for something else
'Til then I'll hold it downEmbed
