7 Rooms of Gloom Lyrics
(Seven rooms) I see a house
A house of stone
(Filled with gloom) A lonely house
'Cause now you've gone
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Seven rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) I live with emptiness
Without your tenderness

You took the dream I had for us
Turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that never rings
I watch a door that never rings
Bring you back into my life
Turn this darkness into light
I'm all alone in this house
Turn this house to a home

I need your touch to comfort me
Your tender, tender arms that once held me

(Seven rooms) Without your love
Your love inside
(Filled with gloom) This house is just a place
To run and hide
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Seven rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) Rooms of emptiness
Without your tenderness
Don't make me live from day to day
Watching a clock that ticks away
Another day, another way
Another reason for me to stay
I need you here, here with me
I need you, darling, desperately
I'm all alone, all alone
In this house that's not a home

I miss your love I once had known
I miss your kiss that was my very, very own

(Seven rooms) Empty silence
Surrounding me
(Filled with gloom) Lonely walls
They stare at me
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) I live with emptiness
Without your tenderness

All the windows are painted black
And wait right here till you come back
I'll keep waiting, waiting
Till your face again I see
(Coming back
When are you coming back?)Embed
