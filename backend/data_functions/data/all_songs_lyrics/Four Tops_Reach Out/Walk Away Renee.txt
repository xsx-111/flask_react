Walk Away Renee LyricsAnd when I see the sign that points one way
The lot we used to pass by every day
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
You're not to blame
From deep inside the tears
I'm forced to cry
From deep inside the pain
That I chose to hide
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain burns down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain burns down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries
Your name and mine inside
A heart on a wall
Still finds a way to haunt me
Though they're so small
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
You're not to blame1Embed
