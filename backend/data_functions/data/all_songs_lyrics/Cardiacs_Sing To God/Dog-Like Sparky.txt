Dog-Like Sparky LyricsYou ever believed in big strong daddy legs?
And do you believe in bad flying aeroplane?
Then you will rejoice in believing in Dog-like Sparky
He's all heaven sent but will he suffer from your sweetness
If I am a dog then shake hands
Brother, sis, we'll never ever sing like Barky
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
No feet for me and suck red upon my belly
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
Defenders of the world we make believe in
Put your hands on the Holy Bible and scream 'wank'
If I am a dog then shake hands
Brother, sis, we'll never ever sing like Barky
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
No feet for me and suck red upon my belly
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
Stay alive without or without praising him off his pins
That glisten wheel-like in their shining wheely tins
Never mind as crawling is my in mind world with everything alive
Stick and suck dribble in my dirty shoes
And crown me 'everything alive'
And so the spirits they do protect him now
Where he is all spoiled
Where he's too squashed and hurt by feelings
Now eat up your hand now eat your...
Brother, sis, we'll never ever sing like Barky
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
No feet for me and suck red upon my belly
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
No feet for me and suck red upon my belly
No feet for me and suck red upon my belly
Never mind as crawling is my in mind world with everything alive
Stick and suck dribble in my dirty shoes
And crown me 'everything alive'
Stick and suck dribble in my shoes
And crown me 'everything alive'
Stick and suck dribble in my dirty shoes
And crown me 'everything alive'
Is me alive and a-crawling?
Is my world?
Crawling is my world!
Crawling is my world!
Is me alive and a-crawling?
Is my world?
Crawling is my world!
Crawling is my world!
And so the spirits they do protect him now
Where he is all spoiled
Where he's too squashed and hurt by feelings
If I am a dog then shake hands
Brother, sis, we'll never ever sing like Barky
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
No feet for me and suck red upon my belly
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
Brother, sis, we'll never ever sing like Barky
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
No feet for me and suck red upon my belly
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
Brother, sis, we'll never ever sing like Barky
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
No feet for me and suck red upon my belly
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
Brother, sis, we...Embed
