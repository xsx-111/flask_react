Eden on the Air LyricsPlain we make it
How we love plain and EVEN
This is EVEN
Things are fine odd
But we all like it EVEN
This is EVEN
You're on the air
You're on the water
Water's always welcome on the deck
BUT WE like it DRY
Odds can call in all day
But they AIN'T GET any ANSWERS
You're on the air
You're on the waterEmbed
