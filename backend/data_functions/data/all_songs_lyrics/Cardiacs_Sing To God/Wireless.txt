Wireless Lyrics
Jenny's bed is nailed to the floor
Black dog, tumble-weed, white dress
Play whistley wireless happy

Fireworks under her pillow
Cold girl and deadness
Can you cross your heart?
Jenny played the wireless

Black dog, white dress
Hand holding with her wireless
Kind whistling on when she passed
From this world off into the next

They were all stuck in a
Really small wood boat
To perish on the sea
And then one, one of the sailors
Pulled up the plug
And put it in a bucket
And all water, sea water, came in the boat
And a fish by accident came in
And flipped out again by using its fin
The water coming in looked like a spout
And would make them perish
And then with red fire
Coming out from his gills
Came Action Fish, and was made of metal
And cut through the waves
At one hundred miles an hour
Faster than a torpedo
Red fire coming out from his gills
And jumped into the sky
And shoved a bung into the hole in the boat
And sped off
Cutting through the waves
One hundred miles an hour
Faster than a torpedo
Red fire coming out from his gillsEmbed
