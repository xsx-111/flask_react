Bell Clinks Lyrics
Choosing my resources at random endeavours
As the fool thinks so the bell clinks
Fall for my own pain
There's a tiny step from the sublime to the ridiculous
Thoroughly related which one am I?
So much to be learned from this new age of reason
This is what it shouts and screams
Loudly into my ear
Every single man he has a fool in his sleeve
Whether he wants it there or not
It breeds sanity

One step above the sublime
It amounts to the feeling inside Jon rejects
Jon rejects every feeling inside
Step above the sublime to the ridiculous
Dismissing thoughts in a head
He refuse to accept taking logic within
Within logic within everything he refuse
He fears his creepiest thoughts

Stupid soldier he's falling shot without purpose
Stupid soldier shot at random
Dies without respect
Where's the harm in that?
He should have kept a sane mind after all
How can he be trusted after he dies?
Level head sat proudly on the wisest shoulders
Stares an eyefull toward his sister
Smiles a wiliest smile
Isn't life a wheeze when treasure's in the trees
And I possess longer arms than you or anyone else
One step above the sublime
It amounts to the feeling inside Jon rejects
Jon rejects every feeling inside
Step above the sublime to the ridiculous
Dismissing thoughts in a head
He refuse to accept taking logic within
Within logic within everything he refuse
He believe in a thoughts and a laughter will reign

One step above the sublime
It amounts to the feeling inside Jon rejects
Jon rejects every feeling inside
Step above the sublime to the ridiculous
Dismissing thoughts in a head
He refuse to accept taking logic within
Within logic within everything he refuse
He believe in a thoughts and a laughter will reign

One step above the sublime
It amounts to the feeling inside Jon rejects
Jon rejects every feeling inside
Step above the sublime to the ridiculous
Dismissing thoughts in a head
He refuse to accept taking logic within
Within logic within everything he refuse
He fears his creepiest thoughtsEmbed
