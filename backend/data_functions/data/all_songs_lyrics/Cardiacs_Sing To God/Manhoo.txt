Manhoo Lyrics
Blind be spirit-core with its lies

Burned as bright as a rocket. All falsehoods set alight
Flamed raised in shame on a speedier course
And who's to blame for
Breaking its own self-inflicted graceless home?
Blind be spirit-core with its lies

A misty veil hides a pitiful vengeance born to sail on
All of the seas and a-never returning
Needs to take some beauty sleep deep in the
Oceans and obsolete
Kindly spears core with its penknife

Blind be spirit and lost again and dust in eyed
Heavy heads get buried deeper
Sand in scratching naked eyes
Lost again in a lie all dreadful Oh yeah!

When truth looks like a lie in a different way and
Kept alive and bound by bad chains in a
Beautiful cage
Inside is fear and stable minds
Always forever questioning stubborn you
Befriending your tears and in a different way
The need to take some beauty sleep deep in the
Ocean is obsolete
Blind be spirit-core with its lies
Sand in scratching naked eyes
Lost again in a sea sick land all weepier
Blast me silence and hurt me ears and blast again
With a rifle all dreadful oh yeah!
Blind be spirit dust in eyed heavy heads get deep andâ”€
Stowed away, stowed away, stowed away, stowed away
Stowed away, stowed away, stowed away, stowed away
Stowed away

Truth looks like a lie, was held it out to him
Who shook the tree viciously for LOVE

Blind be spirit and lost again and dust in eyed
Heavy heads get buried deeper
Sand in scratching naked eyes
Lost again in a sea sick land all weepier
Blast me silence and hurt me ears and blast again
With a rifle all dreadful Oh yeah!
Belly-eyed bleeder all terminal, deceive, you fibber of the order
Come swimming up a shape with a stinging tailEmbed
