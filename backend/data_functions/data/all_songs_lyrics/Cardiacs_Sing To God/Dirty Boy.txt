Dirty Boy Lyrics
We cut all his eyes we did
Squeezed the lids and down the grog into hole
He skip with cow-eyed smile to the blissful
Into craggy dress and we will praise him
We will praise him off his pins
Clear him of all sins
Oh my! We sang with strength to carry on
Encouraged him to sing along
We sang of all the world and praised him HOORAY!

Stay alive to live or without
And he is down all over and out

Watch us hang on shoulders as tall and as gold as
Feely hand and finger around all we
And look to see if we care if he is heaven sent or
Hell bent but we will praise him
We will praise him all away
Praise him all away
My arms chancing and you will no way
Live long enough to repay me
I praise you anyway always
Wipes last with brown and pale
He dirty boy, he gone all stale
And down the stair and hallway crawling
And pig and toast and kitchen brawling
Night-time days are all weekless
Alarm charm, he's all up and dressed
He dirty boy, he bathroom dances
And check his jam and breathe on glasses

Spiny grip brings all off 'Mr. Regal Jelly' in hand
Warm feel and suck regal man suck bland
Suck bland away and he's a sleepy cow-eyed dog
He's treading soft sand
Kiss and stroke and praise him
Stroke and praise him
All is worth kiss
Not how to cleanse
And fowl preserver of sick somehow don't worry now
Hold his mouth and stop him breathing
Over and out!Embed
