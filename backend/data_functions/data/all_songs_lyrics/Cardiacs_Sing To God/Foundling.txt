Foundling LyricsTasting sweet and beautiful
But awful too
Here comes the bride
No-one knows where she came from
Ghostly lady is here to warm your bed
Both now and in the life everlasting
Leaving something in the air
Here comes the bride
No-one knows where she came from
He would give himself ten showers a day
In the murky ponds and weedy rivers
And it was wicked of you big dead boy
Suddenly just went to sleep
Well here we are
I could walk with angels
But I'd rather walk with you
(You are) only a foundling
Ghostly lady is here to warm your bed
Both now and in the life everlasting
Leaving something in the air
Here comes the bride
Nobody knows where she came fromEmbed
