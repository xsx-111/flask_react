Nurses Whispering Verses (Sing to God) Lyrics
All fear and power
All ready for warning me
Askew with red jetted eye
All as a day in sand (and rain)
And when you're near all me now
And then think never before did it seem so far away
All hostile to me
The nerve is bared, the sense is real

There's places and houses fired
Inspires all fire in the inside you
Times are fine find all nine
And nurses find me in again

Treating our mazey kiteman
Rolling off his belly
Papering his length all off his swing
He mask his hand and he grin
To stay here, or even to play here
Rather than be kept in on his own

We only know what doesn't show
What to, don't ask me why
Oh we're in again and we're all the same
Red as egg laid on the page
Don't mind the unbalanced mind
It's fine and mine and yours too
Share with me and me is clean and
Treating our mazey kiteman
Rolling off his belly
Papering his length all off his swing
But I don't really think so
Maybe
I don't think I care

So no-one else can know
Ah well, another day
Now, nowEmbed
