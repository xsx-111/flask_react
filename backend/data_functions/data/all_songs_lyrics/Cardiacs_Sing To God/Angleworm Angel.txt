Angleworm Angel Lyrics
Reversal of despair
Bright young spark he showing flair
Loosens flesh from machine
Granted it obscene
Thrust his fists
Fisting posts
Still insist he sees the ghost
Of what we try to see
In darkened rooms and endless laughter
Lock into theories old
Existance of all creatures told
Human eyes to snatch a glimpse
Of our lifes genesis
Lust for knife
Such is life
Love for every kind of strife
Angleworm bit in half
Fellow eaten raw and helpless

Perfect it's not as easy to find
The good in ourselves
That we leave behind
Forever sublime
And never quite comprehend
Why that is why we try and we try
Until do us die
To pull up the soil
And plant greener seeds
Perfection an ultimate
Aiming high cannon my
Fear young failure to the sky
Confidence leaknesses dominate my mind
Out of blue into black Ideas meets oblivion
Endless destructible
Delusions of defeat and anguish

Perfect it's not as easy to find
The good in ourselves
That we leave behind
Forever sublime
And never quite comprehend
Why that is why we try and we try
Until do us die
To pull up the soil
And plant greener seeds
Perfection an ultimate

Perfect it's not as easy to find
The good in ourselves
That we leave behind
Forever sublime
And never quite comprehend
Why that is why we try and we try
Until do us die
To pull up the soil
And plant greener seeds
Perfection an ultimate
Perfect it's not as easy to find
The good in ourselves
That we leave behind
Forever sublime
And never quite comprehend
Why that is why we try and we try
Until do us die
To pull up the soil
And plant greener seeds
Perfection an ultimateEmbed
