Flap Off You Beak Lyrics
All nineteen birds flying fast up
They are dead they are not alive
Bad bird you flap off you beak
High and mighty beady bird eye

Featherless me and I be all glad on my own
Doggy-eyed graceless in my home
Steps in wire
High and mighty beady bird eye
They're not alive

They eat no love
They curl up in their hollow tree
And leak the sap that bad birds do

Poison in the drops of black and white pearl
On the 'leaving the cinema' girl
Steps in wire
High and mighty beady bird eye
They're not alive

Don't linger on not pure gold in your hand
And fly again to the end of England
Sad birds flying through the famous London fog
There is no God
There is no 'alive' in my menagerie
Sad birds they are not alive
Nineteen birds flying fast up
They are not alive
(they're not alive)Embed
