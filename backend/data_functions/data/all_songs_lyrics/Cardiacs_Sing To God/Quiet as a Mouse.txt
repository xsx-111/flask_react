Quiet as a Mouse LyricsOh look
And they run back and then pat on the head
Hang on, can we not make them alive?
That's wicked
No, because like put all the dead ones in a round circle
Yeah, pretty as a picture
Why, why would they not be better alive?
Because for a lot of people
This one looks too quiet
Quiet as a mouse
Look who's coming round the corner
Hello
Do you know him?
It's tiny Bob Leith, pretty as a picture
Shall, shall we beat him senseless?
Yes, but this is where I take my time
Quiet as a mouseEmbed
