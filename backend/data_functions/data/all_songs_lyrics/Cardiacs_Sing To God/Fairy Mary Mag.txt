Fairy Mary Mag LyricsDon't do anything just stand there
Holding the line with man boy shaking all hands
If I were a bad dog you'd all be dead
Six big strong boys of the lads chewed off a piece of
Mary Magdalene's arms
While guardians wailed "Oh for shame! For shame!"
I will tear the secret from your arms
And come boys out from that hat!
I cannot see your feet!
Come on my lucky lads! You don't want to live forever!
As I live and breathe as if in danger or as if in doubt
(Ran in circles screaming "SHOUT!")
If I were a bad dog you'd all be dead
(Crucified)
I thought you were dead
