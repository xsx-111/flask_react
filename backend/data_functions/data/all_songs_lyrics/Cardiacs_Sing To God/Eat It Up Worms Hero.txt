Eat It Up Worms Hero Lyrics(three, four)
Make eyes pretty wear clean dress
And Boy get shot into the wilderness
Moving like a worms hero
Looks both ways and goes
Gives birth in his throat
Pin legs make his torso leak
Airs her holes
Her tiny sides going in and out
Shiny worm to heal her hole
Gives birth in his throat
Pin legs make his torso leak
Airs her holes
Her tiny sides going in and out
Shiny worm to heal her hole
Gives birth in his throat
Pin legs make his torso leak
Airs her holes
Her tiny sides going in and out
Shiny worm to heal her hole
And all the beauty tells him he is WORMS HERO
He is love and hatredEmbed
