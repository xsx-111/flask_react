Insect Hoofs on Lassie LyricsReal (or imaginary) ice-spitting fire
(That comfortable sound)
Hands in the air both feet stood on the ground
Lassie's on my TV
I get flat on all fours and start kissing the screen
And I sit like a good dog in the hope that she might
GIVE IN TO ME
What's the matter? Neither good nor bad weather
Makes me all ill-like (Suffer with pain)
But I don't mind, he is me. "Look Lassie! Watch him until
He dies of his brain"
All or nothing (Before he dies of his brain)
Breathe in my skin ooh! It feeling too hard
Start collect the hoofs from my insect graveyard
NO LONGER IMAGINARY
I want it, I need it so BAD that I cry
Let's make between WE you more
Fantastic that we ever feared of
HERO COLLIE! Insect hoofs on Lassie instead of his feet
HE Lassie, not SHE!
Because of ME all SHE is blessed with the
Mane of a HORSE and WINGS of a BEE
(And carrying a cluster of bee eggies in the centre of she)
CUSTOMISING LASSIE
TAIL OUT THE WINDOW
PRESS IN COLOURED GLASS
FOR MORE BEAUTIFUL EYES!
Daddy-long-leg lashes how you flirt, get out of here!
Our hero dog, insect hoofs on Lassie
Worthy of SPACE DOG worthy of ME
After my Lassie customising y'be holding up all your
Tiny insect hoofs AND WORSHIPPING ME
What's the matter?
Insect hoofs on Lassie instead of his feet
(HE Lassie not SHE)
But I don't mind all she is blessed with the
Mane of a HORSE and wings of a BEE
(and carrying a cluster of bee eggies in the centre of she)Embed
