Bellyeye LyricsAll my mind's pissing out of me pouring brain
It's my slave
And I'm counting on the kitchen clean for the masses
I can save yeah I can save
I can save and I'm amazed that I can save and I'm amazed that I can save and I'm amazed
Pissy eyed gaggling's over tomorrow after eighty
After ay!
Time in now really
No! not entirely now, I lied
Now I delay
Need some funds money undone
Me on some for money undone
I know where I don't want to be
Out looking for people in trouble
Oh Hello shadow! You go away and you
Warm me up like only your fire can do
Warm me up like only your fire can do
More of the same
More of the same old highs
Kiddie voice piercing my nodder like a nail
And I can kill
Yeah I stabby all kill Acme Thunderer Blaster I can kill
Yeah I can kill
Storm of feeling good fun fuck my animal heart and ache
And heart and ache
Tiring now dishing out all my fancy almond ache
And arm and ache
Leaf all my money oh my!
Me need some funds money undone
Me on some for money undone
What's in my hand? It's your beady-eyed blade on the edge of my tongue
It's your belly-eyed bleeder
Only just begun to rebuild him
But will he turn out like you've done
Woah!
Tiring wait 'till these things can fly
Now that I sit inside her fire
My feet firm higher Me filled with gloom
Warm me up like only your fire can do
Big belly-eyed bleeder on the top of you
I know where I don't want to be
Out looking for people in trouble
Oh Hello shadow!
You go away and you warm meEmbed
