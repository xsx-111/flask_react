And together we'll blow him to the ends of the earth

He went off dead
He went off dead with his hand with his

Big gun fire hand IN HIS MOUTH IN HIS HAND
And puts a BIG GUN up inside of his mouth and he
FIRES TILL HE CRIES
A bullet his gullet and he fires till he cries
UP INSIDE TILL HE

"Hello sir I'm in a tango in a different timing I will never lose my anger, I haven't got a secret
Secrets are in my secret box down my avenue
Suck away my tiny dress
I'm cleaner than a FILTHY MESS!
Cleaner than a BIG MESS!"
