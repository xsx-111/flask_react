Odd Even LyricsDied in earth did brother by the side of sister
No moist just dry fire
Midas feet were ruined
Merry Jesus brew in sent her soul by wire
One hand in mouth she dug into the sandy soil
All gently down she goes
And you were all fine dry worlds
All the wells are useless
And the thirsty omens don't smile on your kind
Distress is a pest
Gratified with the smallest things it make and find
Cried with her apron all over her head
She gone all gently down as always
And we can't just drive away in a nice car
A nice car
Came here all thirsty and drank from my hands
All gone
Loudly and long
Drank loudly and long
Can't just drive away in a nice car
A nice carEmbed
