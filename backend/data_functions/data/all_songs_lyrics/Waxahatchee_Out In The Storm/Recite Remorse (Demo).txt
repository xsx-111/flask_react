Recite Remorse (Demo) LyricsI was shaking like a leaf
I was clenching my fists
I was losing my mind, yeah
I was dancing with death
When I stood in my front yard
Felt the sun on my face
It just felt like a rerun
Holding everything in place
For a moment I was not lost
I was waiting for permission to take off
When we were new to each other
In the city after dark
You were so condescending
You wrote me in, gave me a part
See, I always gravitate toward
Those who are unimpressed
I saw you as a big fish
I saw you as a conquest
And I know for you it's easy to walk away
You would never ask permission or rue the day
I was out of my body
Reciting lines of remorse
I was losing my mind, yeah
I was halfway out the doorEmbed
