Silver (Demo) LyricsI stare at myself
The whole world keeps turnin'
I went out in the storm
Thought I felt the house burnin'
The kiss on my lips
Starts to feel unfamiliar
A part of me rots
My skin all turns silver
You tell a classic story
Smothered underneath formality
I'll portray the old shag carpet
You can walk all over me
If I turn to stone
The whole world keeps turnin'
I went out in the storm
And I'm never returnin'Embed
