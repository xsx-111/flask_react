Hear You Lyrics
I don't want to dry your tears
You're in the shadows, you're always near
Oh, you're crystal clear
Oh

You give up half your life
Talking trash, up all night
Stake out the coolest girl
She smiles at you, weighs on the world
I could have lied to you
Spineless, shrinking, tried and true
You muffle a paradigm
Yeah you'll have your truth, I'll have mine

I don't want to hear you out
I lay on the floor, you stomp around
Oh, and you fall down
Oh

I stand up on that stage
You sink your teeth, build your own cage
Wait for the coolest girl
You break her down, make her hear you out
I could have fought with you
Forever and never break through
You play your hand cut and dry
Yeah you'll have your side, I'll have mineEmbed
