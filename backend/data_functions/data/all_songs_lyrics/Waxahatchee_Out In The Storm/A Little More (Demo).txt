A Little More (Demo) LyricsWe pretend to be kind
I hold everything back
You politely point out
All of the goodness this world lacks
You draw x's on our backs
And the feeling tapers off
My feeling tapers off
Reality is lost
Reality is lost
I move delicately
I slowly choose my words
And when my presence is felt
I'll fly away just like a bird
A jagged truth left unheard
And I live a little more
I live a little more
And I die a little more
I die a little moreEmbed
