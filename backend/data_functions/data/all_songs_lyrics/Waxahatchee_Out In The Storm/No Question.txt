No Question LyricsMy objective was blind
You were always looking for a fight
An invisible race
We'll be in it til one of us dies
You went back in time today
Expecting me to do the same
And I can't get away
I can't get away
I can't get away
When you viciously crave captivation
You set the tone
You will mimic a martyr
Quiet, and left alone
Behind sycophantic amends
You sleep around with most of my friends
And it never ends
It never ends
It never ends
When I'm seeing red I'm embarrassed
It's suffocating
I hoped howling out all this truth
Would be liberating
But all the pity spills from the seams
And everyone questions the unseen
And it sets you free
It sets you free
It sets you freeEmbed
