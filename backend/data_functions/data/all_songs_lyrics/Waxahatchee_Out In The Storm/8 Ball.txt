8 Ball LyricsHey
I'll go away
You let me take my own damn car
To Brooklyn, New York, USA
I'll dream
Embarrassing reverie
I'm all detached feeling like myself
I'll drink too much, I'll cause a big scene
And I'll breathe
I don't care who sees
I'll be nobody
I'll be the wind blowing through the leaves
When I fall
I will not be ashamed at all
You'll see a failure
You wanna brand my losing streak
You wanna be the 8 ball
Why
I curiously catch your eye
The blood that's keeping it alive
Is the illusion of the limelight
Manhood
The tragically misunderstood
And you will bury the bad blood
I am remiss
I am bodiless output
What you see
It could not possibly be me
I'm your diversion
I am the wind blowing down your tree
It's plain
I lit the groundwork up in flames
We watch the smoke rise
You wanna name my weakness
You wanna be the rainEmbed
