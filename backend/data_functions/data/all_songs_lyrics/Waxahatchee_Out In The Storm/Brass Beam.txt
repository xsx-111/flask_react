Brass Beam LyricsI took a pill, I went to sleep for the first time in weeks
You kept me up with all your manic energy
I had to go, I put it out just like a cigarette
I'd never be a girl you'd like or trust or you'd respect
When I think about it I wanna punch the wall
When I remember everything I wonder if I'll always feel small
You look for me in the broken glass and Styrofoam
Painting yourself as a sufferer, a stepping stone
You work real hard to herd your friends into a gallery
Narcissistic injury disguised as masterpiece
I just wanna run, yeah, I don't wanna fight
I just want to sing my songs and sleep through the night
I endured your criticism, self-loathing and all your doubt
I held you up above myself trying to ride it out
I got lost in your rendition of reality
All my offering rendered boring hyperbole
I couldn't see the sun from there, just a beam
I thought it would never come out, yeah
I couldn't see the sun from there, just a beam
I thought it would never come out, yeah, I had to leaveEmbed
