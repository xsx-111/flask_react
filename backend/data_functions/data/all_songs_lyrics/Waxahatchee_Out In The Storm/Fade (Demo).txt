Fade (Demo) LyricsYou wring me out, I tell the truth
I feel amazing today
You interrupt, you yell in my face
But you finally hear me say
That I'll walk, I'm walking away
I watched myself fade and fade
I laid down next to you
For three years shedding my skin
Dreaming about the potential
The person I could have been
I left home with nothing
I left home with nothing
I left home with nothing
First saw you through childish eyes
I was in love with a song
A fleeting glimpse, romanticized
And I hoped you let me hang on
I went, I went along
I lied to myself
I always knew it was wrong
I poured everything out
It never would be enough
I kissed you goodbye
And hid for the rest of your life
I stayed out of your way
I stayed out of your way
I stayed out of your way
I'm fading, fading away
I'm fading, fading away
I'm fading fading fading fading awayEmbed
