New Year Lyrics
She sets her alarm, five minutes to midnight
And wakes just in time to greet the new year
Remembers the kisses, remembers the laughter
And all that's gone away

She shuffles around, turning the lights on
Goes to the kitchen, gets the champagne
Opens the window and wrapped in a blanket
Begins to count and wait

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five
Four, three, two, one

Happy new year, happy new year

They say you can hear it over the island
Starting in Times Square and spreading throughout
A roar like the ocean, it comes from a distance
Grows louder then turns quiet

She sits in a dream or in a memory
While old conversations play in her ears
Sometimes the minutes feel longer than hours
Some days feel long as years
She's just glad she gets to be around
To see another spring come to this town

Happy new year, happy new year
To you

She sets her alarm five minutes to midnight
And wakes just in time to say her goodbyes
Thanking the old year for all it has brought her
No mention of the things it took away

She shuffles around, turning the lights out
Closes the window, checks on the locks
Folds up the blanket, empties the bottle
And leaves it in the hallway dark

She's just glad she gets to be around
To see another spring come to this town

Happy new year, happy new year
Happy new year, happy new year
Happy new year, happy new year
To you
Happy new year, happy new year
Happy new year, happy new year
Happy new year, happy new year
To youEmbed
