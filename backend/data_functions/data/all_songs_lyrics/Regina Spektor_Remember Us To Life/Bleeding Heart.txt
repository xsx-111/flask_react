Bleeding Heart Lyrics
What you got on tap?
I'll take two of that
I'm chasing a story I heard
When I was here last
At the back of the class
You pretended you never got lost
You're at the back of the class, in the back of the bus
Sitting out at the dance, always saying 'no thanks'
When they see you around
You look down at the ground
But when they walk away
You wish they'd stay

Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart

You can't help but stare
At everyone there
It's you versus everyone else
Your outfit's a crime
You feel their cold minds placing you under arrest
And you serve your time
Drinking all night long
Staring at the walls of your jail-like home
Listening to that song
'Cause it hurts just right
Till everything is gone tonight
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart

Someday you'll grow up and then you'll forget
All of the pain you endured
Until you walk by
A sad pair of eyes
And up will come back all the hurt
And you'll see their pain as they look away
And you want to help, but there's just no way
'Cause you won the war, so it's not your turn
But everything inside still burns

Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never never mind mind mind
Never mind your bleeding heart
Never never never mind mind mind
Never mind your bleeding heart
Never never never mind mind mind
Never mind your bleeding heart
Never never never mind mind mind

How long must I wait?
Till you learn that it's not too late
How long must I cry?
Till you know that you really tried
How long must I try?
Till you learn that dreaming's hard
How long must I dream?
Till you heal your bleeding heart
Never mind your bleeding heart6Embed
