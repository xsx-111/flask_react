End of Thought LyricsI thought about what you said
And it's the end of the thought that really got in my head
Be careful before you decide
Be careful before you decide
Risk only what you won't miss
And all the rest you can leave for all the others to take
You cannot make a mistake
The universe is too big
The universe is too big
I don't know why I let you stay
I don't know why I let you stay
I don't know why I let you stay around
In my mind
I thought about what you said
And it's the end of your thought that really made me upset
Be careful before you decide
The universe is too big
The universe is too big
You cannot make a mistake
You cannot make a mistake
I don't know why I let you stay
I don't know why I let you stay
I don't know why I let you stay around
In my mindEmbed
