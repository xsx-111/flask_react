The Light Lyrics
The light was shining in my eyes before I closed them
And all the dreams I had the night before came back
The faces that I'd seen looked so familiar
But they're just strangers - I haven't met them yet

I know the morning is wiser than the evening
I know that wrong and right can sometimes look the same
So many things I know, but they don't help me
Each day I open up my eyes and start again

The light comes shining in my eyes
The light comes shining in my eyes
The light comes shining in my eyes
The light comes shining in my eyes

So many stories, I want to tell you
I wish that I could show you the many things I've seen
You and your daddy, you both look like poets
Your eyes are open wide while you are in a dream

I know the morning is wiser than the night time
I know there's nothing wrong, I shouldn't feel so down
So many things I know, but they don't help me
Each day I open up my eyes to look around
The sun comes shining in my eyes
The sun comes shining in my eyes
The sun comes shining in my eyes
The sun comes shining in....

My eyes are closed now
Count the stars inside your mind
Count the breaths, count heartbeats
Count the sounds of life

The light was shining in my eyes before I closed them
And all the dreams I had the night before were gone
The faces that I'd seen looked so familiar
But I forgot them all when I saw the sun

I know the morning is wiser than the evening
I know that all of life just happens in between
So many things I know, but they don't help me
Each day I open up my eyes and it begins

The light comes shining in my eyes
The light comes shining in my eyes
The light comes shining in my eyes
The light comes shining in my eyes
The light, the light, the light, the light
The light, the light, the light...1Embed
