The One Who Stayed and the One Who Left Lyrics
He went to visit an old, old friend
And it was long, long overdue
And though they stayed up very late
They never talked out of turn or tune
And every time they'd say goodbye
Well he'd just stay another while
They started from a distant place
And were so happy face to face

The one who left wanted everything
The one who stayed never wanted more
It's not your choice, it's how you're built
It's in a blueprint of your soul
The one who left, he dropped his smile
And they sat quiet for a while
Then the one who stayed began to speak
And in his words, he answered why

I'm just another drop in the bucket
I'm just another song on a jukebox
I'm just another face in the crowd
Another fish in the sea
Something to being one of the many
Something to being one in the masses
Something to being surrounded by others
And not alone by yourself
I never wanted the bright lights in my eyes, I'm much too quiet
I never wanted them pointing their fingers at me
Oh no, but...

Something to being one of the many
Something to being one in the masses
Something to being surrounded by others
And not alone by yourself

The one who left he knew it then
And he would never doubt again
He loved this life, he loved his friend
But he'd keep running 'til the end
All words they said hovered above
All of the pain, all of the love
They hugged goodbye
And in his room, he sang real quiet to the moon

Something to being one of the many
Who get to sing the songs on the jukebox
Who get to stay awake all night
And dream half of the day
Something to waking up in a new town
Something to singing songs to a new crowd
Something to being surrounded by others
And not alone by yourself
I never wanted the bright lights in my eyes, I'm much too quiet
I never wanted them pointing their fingers at me
Oh no, but...

Something to being one of the many
Who get to sing the songs on the jukebox
Who get to stay awake all night
And dream half of the day
Then wake up in a new town
Just another face in the crowd1Embed
