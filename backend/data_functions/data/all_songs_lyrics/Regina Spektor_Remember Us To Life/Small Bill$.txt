Small Bill$ Lyrics
His destiny was just too big to spend
So he broke it into smaller bills and change
By the time he'd try to buy the things he needed
He had spent it all on loosies and weed and
He had spent it all on chips and Coca-Cola
He had spent it all on chocolate and vanilla
He had spent it all and didn't even feel it
He had spent it all and didn't even feel it

La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la...

All the poets in the alley coughing up blood
And their visions and their dreams are coming up red
They can either wake up or go deeper
But it's so dangerous to wake a deep sleeper
It's like awakening a bear in winter
To feel the reckoning of hunger splinter
He's gonna stretch his claws and feel his power
And you are gonna know your final hour
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
Dum-dum-dum, da-dum...

Better get a head start, start running
While you were skimming from the top was sunny
But all the weather 'bout to turn real crummy
'Cause everybody gonna want their money
Yeah, everybody gonna want their money
Better get a head start, start running
Better get a head start, start running
'Cause it's about to get so unfunny
All the poets in the alley coughing up blood
And their visions and their dreams are coming up red
They can either wake up or go deeper
But it's so dangerous to wake a deep sleeper

La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la...
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la...5Embed
