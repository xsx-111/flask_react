Tornadoland Lyrics
It’s so much easier than you think
You try so hard
And every time you get it wrong
You get it right, you get it wrong
But you get it right
You get it right

The mind runs faster
Thoughts are louder than your words
And every time you turn around
It starts to hurt, hurt

It starts to hurt
But you wanna be heard
Wanna be heard

Wanna be louder than the storms around
You hear them through the windows and the doors
Everybody’s time has come
It’s everybody’s moment, except yours

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Before the light goes out
Why don’t you close your eyes?
And all the monsters in your mind
Just wanna be nice
They wanna be kind
They wanna play nice

They wanna be softer than the storms around
You feel them through the windows and the doors
Everybody’s time has come
It’s everybody’s moment, except yours

Everybody moment, everybody moment
Everybody moment, except yours, 'cept yours
Everybody moment, everybody moment
Everybody moment, except yours, 'cept yours
Everybody moment, everybody moment
Everybody moment, except yours, 'cept yours
Everybody moment, everybody moment
Everybody moment, except yours, 'cept yoursEmbed
