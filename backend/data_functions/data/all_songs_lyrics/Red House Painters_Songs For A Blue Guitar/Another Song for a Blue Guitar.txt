Another Song for a Blue Guitar LyricsShe comes apart at the seams 'cause she never dreams
And she lays up awake cause her feelings ache
And the one thing she found as she gazed at the sea
Was that she lost her faith, her faith in me
In the early morning I can't make up a thing
And I can barely play, I don't like to sing
So I picked up my brush painted blue guitar
And I ripped off the chords from Bron-Yr-Aur
So I played her a song but the timing was wrong
Poor choices of chords and the words were forced
And the one thing that I found as I gazed at the sea
Was that she lost all hope, all hope in me
And the one thing that I found as I looked at the sea
Was that she lost all hope, all hope for me
And the one thing that she found as she gazed at the sea
Was that she lost her faith, her faith in meEmbed
