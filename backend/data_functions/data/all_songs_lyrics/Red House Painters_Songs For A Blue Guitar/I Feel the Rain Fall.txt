I Feel the Rain Fall LyricsI feel the rain fall down my back
I'm going back
To my place of work
To get things done, to get them right
But I'll mess them up
Like I always do
Buried in words about you
This year, oh what a year
I laid around just feeling down
And from our happy room
I watched the seasons as they flew
And when Christmas came
I laid my head to rest in shame
'cause with my finished work
I turned my head back
Still didn't work
So I put it to bed, you often swore
To find me dead
Too many times enough
To start again, to give it up
And then the morning came
To light the day, to light my way
'cause with my finished work
I turned my head back
Still didn't work
I feel the rain fall down my back
I'm going backEmbed
