Have You Forgotten LyricsI can't let you be
Cause your beauty won't allow me
Wrapped in white sheets
Like an angel from a bedtime story
Shut out what they say
Cause your friends are fucked up anyway
When they come around
Somehow they feel up and you feel down
When we were kids
We hated things our parents did
We listened low
To Casey Kasem's radio show
That's when friends were nice
To think of them just makes you feel nice
The smell of grass in spring
In October leaves covered everything
Have you forgotten how to love yourself
I can't believe
All the good things that you did for me
Sat back in a chair
Like a princess from a faraway place
Nobody's nice
When you're older your heart turns to ice
And shut out what they say
They're too dumb to mean it anyway
When we were kids
We hated things our sisters did
Backyard summer pools
And Christmas trees were beautiful
And the sentiment of color mirrored ornaments
And the open drapes
Look out on frozen farmhouse landscapes
Have you forgotten how to love yourself
Have you forgotten how to love yourselfEmbed
