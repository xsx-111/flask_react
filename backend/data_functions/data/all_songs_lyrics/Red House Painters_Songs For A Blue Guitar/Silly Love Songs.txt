Silly Love Songs LyricsYou'd think that people would have
Had enough of silly love songs
I look around and I see it isn't so
Some people wanna fill the world
With silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
How I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me
Now, can't you see?
She gave me more, she gave it all to me
What's wrong with that?
How I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?Embed
