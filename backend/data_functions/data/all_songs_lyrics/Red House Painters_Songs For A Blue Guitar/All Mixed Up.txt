All Mixed Up Lyrics
She shadows me in the mirror
She never leaves on the light
And some things that I say to her
They just don't seem to bite

It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up

She tricks me into thinkin'
I can't believe my eyes
I wait for her forever
But she never does arrive

It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up

She says leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything wil be alright
(Be alright)
She says leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be alright
(Be alright)
She's always out makin' pictures
She's always out makin' scenes
She's always out the window
When it comes to makin' dreams

It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up

She says leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be alright
(Be alright)
She says leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be alright
(Be alright)
She says leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be, be alright
(Be alright)
She says leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be, be alright
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up1Embed
