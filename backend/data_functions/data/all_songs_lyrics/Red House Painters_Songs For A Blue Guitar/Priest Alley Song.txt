Priest Alley Song LyricsGoing past Golden Gate Elementary everyday
Kids down colorful hill
Recess and fire drill
She likes the side without the heat
Where the sun don't beat
She likes the cooler side of Washington Street
Hummingbirds, pigeons and doves
Hover rooftops above
Lights shine down into the tides
Over hillsides
See where the bridge and mountain meet
At the mouth of the sea
And where the sailboats live at day
And turn away
With the purple evening
Losing our love and hope
In the sky's fluorescent glow
She takes her thoughts and cares
Into the moonlit alley stairs
Still in my hand I feel the sting
And the sounds of bells ring
And the memory of your face
Never washes away
With the current leavingEmbed
