My One and Only LyricsMy one and only
What am I gonna do if you turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you?
I'd be so lonely
Where am I gonna go if you turn me down?
Why blacken all my skies of blue?
I tell you, I'm not asking any miracle
It can be done, it can be done
I know a clergyman who will grow lyrical
And make us one, and make us one
So, my one and only
There isn't a reason why you should turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you
My one and only
What am I gonna do if you turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you?
I'd be so lonely
Where am I gonna go if you turn me down?
Why blacken all my skies of blue?
I tell you, I'm not asking any miracle
It can be done, it can be done
I know a clergyman who will grow lyrical
And make us one, and make us one
So, my one and only
There isn't a reason why you should turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you
It's time you woke up
It's time you spoke up
When I'm so crazy over you
My one and only
What am I gonna do?
My one and onlyEmbed
