But Not For Me LyricsThey're writing songs of love, but not for me
The lucky stars above, but not for me
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lackaday
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me
It all began so well, but what an end
This is the time a fellow needs a friend
When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot
When there's no knot, I guess he's not for me1Embed
