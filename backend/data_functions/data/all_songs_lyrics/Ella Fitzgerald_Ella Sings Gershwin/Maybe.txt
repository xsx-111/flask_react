Maybe LyricsSooner or later, maybe
If you wait, maybe
Some kind of fate, maybe
Will help you discover where to find your lover
You will hear yoo-hoo
He'll be near, yoo-hoo
Paradise will open its gate
Maybe soon, maybe late
Sooner or later, maybe
If you wait, maybe
Some kind of fate, maybe
Will help you discover where to find your lover
You will hear yoo-hoo
He'll be near, yoo-hoo
Paradise will open its gate
Maybe soon, maybe lateEmbed
