Send Her My Love Lyrics
It's been so long
Since I've seen her face
You say she's doing fine
I still recall
A sad cafe
How it hurt so bad to see her cry
I didn't want to say good-bye

Send her my love, memories remain
Send her my love, roses never fade
Send her my love

The same hotel, the same old room
I'm on the road again
She needed so much more
Than I could give
We knew our love could not pretend
Broken hearts can always mend

Send her my love, memories remain
Send her my love, roses never fade
Send her my love
Calling out her name I'm dreaming
Reflections of a face I'm seeing
It's her voice
That keeps on haunting me

Send her my love, memories remain
Send her my love, roses never fade
Send her my love

Send her, send her my love
Roses never fade
Memories remain
Send her, send her my love5Embed
