Liberty LyricsSee the mountains
With my lady
As the eagle
In the golden sky
Towers over purple majesty
In the mountains
Lives a freedom
There's a river
You can hear it say
"From the delta flows the Liberty"
As the twilight of evening is broken
Lacy, silvery, starlight unfoldin'
'Round and 'round in a wave of emotion
Words of love sometimes better unspoken
Nothing equals a sea of devotion
Oooo, desire sets the wheels into motion
We all agree
We live to be free
They can't tell us
They can't tell us, how to be
We, we all agree
You individually
We the people
Share the power
Hold the keyEmbed
