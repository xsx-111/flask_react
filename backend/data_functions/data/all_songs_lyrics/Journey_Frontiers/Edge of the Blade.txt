Edge of the Blade Lyrics
You've been trying, very hard
Now this time you've gone too far
You're performance perfect
In every way perfect!
I hear rumors all around
Contracts and lawyers
And champagne downtown
Tell me what you think
You want me to do
I've been always fair with you
Turning on me
After all we've been through
You want trouble then that's just
The way it will be

You're caught up in the power
A blue magical maze
Now the circle is broken
In a spellbinding rage
Better see if you're holding
The wrong edge of the blade
If it's sharp, if it cuts
Enjoy yourselfEmbed
