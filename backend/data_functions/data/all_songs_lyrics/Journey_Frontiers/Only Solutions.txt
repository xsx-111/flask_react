Only Solutions LyricsIn the jungle I run tonight
Find no peace to logical life
No confusion, just wrong or right, oh yeah
Faces, numbers I recognize
You don't fool me with cynical lies
No problems, no compromise, oh yeah
Only solutions
Don't pull me down, I just wanna hear
Only solutions
Oh, it won't be long, it won't take too long
Modern times drive me insane
Explanations I can't explain
Leaves me standing in the rain, oh yeah
Solving mysteries with nothing to lose
Magic leaves you without any clues
There's only so much one man can do, oh yeah
Only solutions
Don't pull me down, I just wanna hear
Only solutions
Oh it won't be long, it won't take too long
Only solutions
Don't pull me down, I just wanna hear
Now that the sun is shining
Clear vision, clear vision
In the jungle I run tonight
Find no peace to logical life
No confusion, just wrong or right, oh yeah
Faces, numbers I recognize
You don't fool me with cynical lies
No problems, no compromise, oh yeah
Only solutions
It's my point of view
Only solutions
Oh, clear vision
Only solutions
No second thoughts
Only solutions
No, no, no contradictions
People reason
People reason
No escapeEmbed
