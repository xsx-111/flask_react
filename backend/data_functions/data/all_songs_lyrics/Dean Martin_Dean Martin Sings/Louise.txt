Louise LyricsEvery little breeze seems to whisper Louise
Birds in the trees twitter Louise
Each little rose tells me it knows I love you
Love you
Every little beat that I feel in my heart
Seems to repeat what I felt at the start
Each little sign tells me that I adore you
Louise
Oh just to see and hear you
Brings joy I never knew
But to be so near you
Thrills me through and through
Well anyone can see why I wanted your kiss
It had to be but the wonder is this
Can it be true someone like you could love me
Oh Louise
Oh just to see and hear you
Brings joy I never knew
But to be so near you
Thrills me through and through
So anyone can see why I wanted your kiss
It had to be but the wonder is this
Can it be true someone like you could love me
Oh LouiseEmbed
