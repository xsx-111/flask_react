Rare Birds LyricsRare Birds, we are out in space
And at the moment we're weightless
This feeling will last as long as we like
Charming the views as we orbit the earth
And it is constantly changing
It's living with pain
It's telling us this
We will Take off
From the belts of Radiation
And at the moment of Impact
We feel a powerful
Shockwave from the sun
Colliding we see
Results of Beta Decay
Still the earth's not withstanding
Demand is growing
We're breaking her back
Falsetto Folkies with Pitchfork at yr side
Your tunes they will be forgotten
Way out in the Desert boy  there's nowhere to hide
From your face in the Sun's Daily Mirror
Black Pirate Paradox
Silver and Gold
Floating just over your head
Weeping , Once upon
An angel we cried
But the whole tone was changing
Our friends, they did not follow us here
Yeah We were Rare Birds
We made magic on some fallen star
And we were perfectly timeless, working
,loving and losing our fear
Well It's a Hand Me Down riddle
With God on it's side
His tone and his trumpet forgotten
Way out in the Desert boy
There's nowhere to hide
See your face in the suns daily mirror
Pelican cases on Jesusâ€™s flight
W no room in the Overheads
