49 Hairflips LyricsWe were burning we were looting
We were learning one or two things about life
We should fuck right in front of them
Just to show them our light
We’ll be fucking we’ll be sucking
While the rest of them were posting their lives
These kids will never rock again
Sign of the times
Yeah rimming and shooting
I'm so destitute without your love
YOU’RE MOTHER earth ecstasy
I call it divine
Spinning and hurting
Theres no resolution tonight
When will I breathe deep again again
Is there laughter in sight?
49 HAIRFLIPS 
49 HAIRFLIPS on DAYQUIL  …
I believe in you
Do you believe in me ?
No we don’t believe in anything
I’m not  leaving these  walls
Without  the  prettiest song I  can  find
I  miss  your  laugh most of  all
I  really  miss  it  tonightEmbed
