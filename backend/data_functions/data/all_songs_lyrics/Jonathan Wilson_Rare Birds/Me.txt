Me LyricsMe, let’s look at me
Did I pirouette again
Out of the dream?
Just me
And all that I could be
And have I sang of peace at least?
Have I helped my fellow man at all?
Just a song with me in  question \\
A cry for  deeper understanding
Botticelli angels flying
Don’t mind living don’t mind dying
Just a song with me in question
A cry for  deeper understanding
Botticelli angels flying
Will i live forever?
Playing cards with jesus
In some gold salvation army
Making plans for the future
Surrounded by celestial mothers
Where will we be when we are?
I think i need a cup of tea
I need everything
In the leaded mirror i was crying
I think I need a cup of tea
I need everything
Why would we be where we were?
Where will I be when I am?Embed
