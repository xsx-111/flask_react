Trafalgar Square Lyrics
I seen you walking through Trafalgar Square
Little Billy Shears was on piano
Well, I didn't think you noticed and I didn't think you cared but
Your flight was fluid, you're a sparrow
I seen you driving down the 405
Hey, were you listening to Zappa?
Well, in the filthy catacombs beneath Houdini's house
Rudy Valentino waits and he wonders

And he says
Isn't it a miracle we're still floating?
Isn't it a miracle we're not frozen?
Isn't it a miracle we're all chosen?

I heard you whistling through Trafalgar Square
You and Little Jimmy Dickens
Well, I didn't think the quartet of lions even cared
It was Nelson Rockefeller on percussion
Yes he was

And he said
Isn't it a miracle we're still floating?
Isn't it a miracle we're not frozen?
Isn't it a miracle we're all chosen?
To be moving, moving something
To be flying where angels fear to tread
To be wanting, wanting nothing
To be driving
To be soaring, always soaring
To be living

I seen you driving Benedict late at night
Little Stevie Jones was riding shotgun
No, I didn't think a Cadillac could float above the ground
With the wrath of God shining down
No, I didn't think a Cadillac could float above the ground
With the wrath of God shining down
No, I didn't think a Cadillac could float above the ground
With God's of love shining down
God, God, God, God
Wrath of God shining down
Wrath of God shining down
God, God, God, God
(Shining down)Embed
