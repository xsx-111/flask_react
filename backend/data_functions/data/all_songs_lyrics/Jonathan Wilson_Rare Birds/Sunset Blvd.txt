Sunset Blvd LyricsThere's a cherry on top tonight
For men who look like jesus tonight
If you play your cards right
You can be the the son of god tonight
You were thin you were undersized for the spring
You entered your name just as  “tight blue jeans”
In my phone I guess you do this kind of thing
Ahh yeah
Well we met on the floor
CCR was playing
“long as i can see the light”
They were singing
You gave me the look
That said “lets be animals tonight”
”right away we were synthesized"
So we took off
Down sunset boulevard
The back tires were spinning
The axles they were teething us into beyond
Way out on that boulevard
We can be weightless, timeless
Tonight  you are heavy on my mind
I watched you
Drift behind  my eyes
I try to roll with the punches I  flow with the tide
Guess i thought you’d be forever
You’re now with me never
Moments of heaven
Frozen in a van  with you girl
I miss the lightness of laughter with you
So I tear out to sunset blvd
Yeah my back tires
They are spinning
The axles they are teething me
Into beyond
Way out on that blvd
I can be weightless
I can be timeless…
So far down  sunset blvd
Yeah my back tires are spinning
My axles they are teething me
Into beyond
Way out on that blvd
Way out on that blvd
Way out on that precious blvd
We can be weightless
Timeless…1Embed
