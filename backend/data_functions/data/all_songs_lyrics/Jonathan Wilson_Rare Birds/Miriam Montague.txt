Miriam Montague LyricsMiriam Montague
He’s looking up at you
And you’re spinning all the boys into a dream
You woo them all into your eyes until they gleam
A commoners cosmonaut
The better half of the have me nots
You are the sun rays of your twickenham garden
Sweet beauty rough with animal abandon
Heartfelt hipster folkbots
Tripping on the latest  posh veranda
Squatting underneath Jamaican tower
Plugging into dirty mains power
Oh Miriam the wonders of your magnitude
Your smile exudes from
Light polluted hazes
In the dark
Satin flame rainy days
Rich men on holiday
They toast to wives and sweethearts while you’re dancing
May they never see your green card smile like I do
Pulsating vampire bats
At the Islington automat
The molly’s green
With Patrick’s day excitement
While your Netherlands
Are on the train to Brighton
Heartfelt hipster folkbots
Tripping on the latest  posh veranda
Squatting underneath Jamaican tower
Plugging into dirty mains power
Oh Miriam the wonders of your magnitude
Your smile exudes from
Light polluted hazes
In the dark
Sleep Theodossia
Moving deeper in the dream
Everything as it should be
Flash flood in your heated quantum  temple
Oxford circus angels are they really ?
Cuing up for petrol on the motorway?
Living hand to mouth you kiss them anyway
Oh Miriam the wonders of your magnitude
Your smile exudes from
Light polluted
Hazes in the  dark
Oh Miriam the wonders of your magnitude
Hazes in the  darkEmbed
