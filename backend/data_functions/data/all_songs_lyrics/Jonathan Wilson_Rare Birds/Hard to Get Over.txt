Hard to Get Over LyricsYou’re so hard to get over
It’s so hard to be done
Yeah you’re  so hard to get over
It’s so hard to be done
The way you make love
Makes me see my funeral
On my wedding day
The way you’re daddy’s girl
I’ve watched the reel
I still don’t believe it
The way that you turn on
Makes it feel like
Christmas on my birthday
The way you taste your own
Did I teach you that?
I really don’t remember
The way you’re so free…
The way your body speaks
Sweet caramel gloom descending
The way you fuck with abandon
In every lucid dream you’re the soul receiver
You’re so hard to get over
You’re the Only One
You’re the Only One
You’re the Only One
You’re the Only OneEmbed
