Hi Ho the Righteous LyricsHi Ho the Righteous
You Strike them where they lie
They’re free from guilt
They’re free from Moral sin
High and low there’s a reason why
I'm stuck here everyday…
It's my own reward
Hey ho the evil
We see you're rising still
Well you're fat you're dying
You’re robbing life's creation
We all know there's a savage beast
In the wonderful wizard of oz
You see the walls are green
But the city itself is not
Lord I thank you
For this Hollywood Playground
There's Royalty
In  Beachfront California
Tell me have you ever seen
The most Romantic Dream?
Where life goes sailing by
Before your eyes
Yeah! woo! uh huh!
Antidepressants and all that
Hi ho the Overtones
They are universal and real
They say the kid doesn't act he takes off into vapor
And there's a wasteland of herman miller’s chairs
Way up in Houndstooth Loft
If you listen closely
You can hear them all get off
Lord I thank you
For this Hollywood Playground
There's Royalty
In Beachfront California
Tell me have you ever seen
The most Romantic Dream?
Where life goes sailing by
Before your eyesEmbed
