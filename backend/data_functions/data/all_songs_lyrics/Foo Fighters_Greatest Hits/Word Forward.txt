Word Forward Lyrics
Goodbye Jimmy, farewell youth
I must be on my way, I've had enough of you
Was a young man, proud and true
Just a simple boy with nothing left to lose

Years that I've wasted
These I.O.U.'s

They're just fucking words
This is life or death
It's time to clear the air, you better save your breath
Say have you heard, say have you heard
The poison in my heart and voices in my head?

Years that I've wasted
These I.O.U.'s

I meant every word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
But it's only words
I meant every word
They're just fucking words

Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word (for word) for word (for word) for word (for word) forward
Word (for word) for word (for word) for word (for word) forward2Embed
