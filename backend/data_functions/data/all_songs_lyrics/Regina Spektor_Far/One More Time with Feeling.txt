One More Time with Feeling LyricsYour stitches are all out
But your scars are healing wrong
The helium balloon inside your room has come undone
And it's pushing up at the ceiling
And the flickering lights it cannot get beyond
Everyone takes turns
Now it's yours to play the part
And they're sitting all around you
Holding copies of your chart
And the misery inside their eyes is
Synchronized and reflecting it to yours
Hold on
One more time with feeling
Try it again, breathing's just a rhythm
Say it in your mind until you know that the words are right
This is why we fight
You thought by now you'd be
So much better than you are
You thought by now they'd see
That you had come so far
And the pride inside their eyes
Would synchronize into a love you've never known
So much more than you've been shown
Hold on
One more time with feeling
Try it again, breathing's just a rhythm
Say it in your mind, until you know that the
Words are right
This is why we fight
This is why we fight2Embed
