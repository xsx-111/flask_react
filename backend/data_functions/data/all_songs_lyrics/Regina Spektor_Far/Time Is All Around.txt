Time Is All Around Lyrics
You step on all my parts
And then you walk right out the door
And I know that your love ain't never
Coming back no more

Time is all around
Except inside my clock
Everybody's waiting for their lover to unlock

Leaves become most beautiful
When they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry, up
Time is all around
Time is all around

I hallucinate a cat between my feet
I'm stepping lightly so as not to hurt, it
Everybody wants to say that you have changed
Of course you've changed, you've changed
Your mind's been rearranged
 x2
Why am I supposed to love if I don't want to love?
Why am I supposed to?
I'm so tired
Why am I supposed to love if I don't want to?
I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want
I don't want
