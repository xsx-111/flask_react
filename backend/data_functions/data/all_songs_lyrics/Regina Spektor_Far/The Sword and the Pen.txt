The Sword and the Pen Lyrics
Don't let me out of this kiss
Don't let me say what I say
The things that scare us today
What if they happen someday?
Don't let me out of your arms for now
What if the sword kills the pen?
What if the god kills the man?
And if he does it with love
Well then it's death from above
And death from above is still a death

I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you

For those who still can recall
The desperate colors of fall
The sweet caresses of May
Only in poems remain
No one recites them these days
For the shame
So what if nothing is safe?
So what if no one is saved?
No matter how sweet
No matter how brave
What if each to his own lonely grave?

I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you

I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you2Embed
