Dance Anthem of the 80's Lyrics
Mmm-t-t
Mmm-t-t-ahh

You are so sweet
Dancing to the beat
There's a meat market down the street
The boys and the girls watch each other eat
You are so sweet, so sweet
Dancing and moving to that beat, that beat
There's a meat market down the street
The boys and girls watch each other eat
The boys and the girls watch each other eat
When they really just wanna watch each other

Sleep
They want to watch, to watch each other
Sleep, sleep sleep
Sleep
They want to watch, to watch each other
Sleep, sleep, sleep

You are so sweet (Once more)
You are so sweet (Solo)

I went walking through the city
Like a drunk, but not
With my slip showing a little
Like a drunk, but not
And I am one of your people
But the cars don't stop
And I am one of your people
But the cars don't stop
And it's been a long time since before I've been touched
Now I'm getting touched all the time
And it's only a matter of whom
And it's only a matter of when
An addiction to hands and feet
There's a meat market down the street
The boys and girls watch each other eat
When they really just wanna watch each other sleep
An addiction to hands and feet
There's a meat market down the street
The boys and girls watch each other eat
When they really just want to watch each other

Sleep
They want to watch, to watch each other
Sleep, sleep, sleep
Sleep
They want to watch, to watch each other
Sleep, sleep, sleep
They want to watch, to watch each other
Sleep, sleep, sleep
They want to watch, to watch each other
Sleep, sleep, sleep3Embed
