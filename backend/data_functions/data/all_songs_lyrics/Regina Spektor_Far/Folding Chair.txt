Folding Chair Lyrics
Come and open up your folding chair next to me
My feet are buried in the sand and there's a breeze
There's a shadow, you can't see my eyes
And the sea is just a wetter version of the skies
Let's get a silver bullet trailer and have a baby boy
I'll safety-pin his clothes all cool and you'll graffiti up his toys
I've got a perfect body, though sometimes I forget
I've got a perfect body cause my eyelashes catch my sweat
Yes, they do, they do

Oo-oo-ooh oo-oo-ooh oo-oo-ooh ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh oo-ooh
Oo-oo-ooh oo-oo-ooh oo-oo-ooh ooh
Oo-oo-ooh oo-oo-ooh

Now I've been sitting on this abandoned beach for years
Waiting for the salty water to cover up my ears
But every time the tide come in to take me home
I get scared, and I'm sitting here alone
Dreaming of the dolphin song

Oo-oo-ooh oo-oo-ooh oo-oo-ooh ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh oo-ooh
Oo-oo-ooh oo-oo-ooh oo-oo-ooh ooh
Oo-oo-ooh oo-oo-ooh
Maybe one day you will understand
I don't want nothing from you but to sweetly hold your hand
Till that day just please don't be so down
Don't make frowns, you silly clown
Just come and open up your folding chair next to me
My feet are buried in the sand and there's a breeze
There's a shadow, you can't see my eyes
And the sea is just a wetter version of the skies

There's a shadow, you can't see my eyes
There's a shadow, you can't see my eyes, eyes8Embed
