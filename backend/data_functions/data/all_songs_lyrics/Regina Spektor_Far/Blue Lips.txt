Blue Lips Lyrics
He stumbled into faith and thought
"God, this is all there is."
The pictures in his mind arose
And began to breathe
And all the gods in all the worlds
Began colliding on a backdrop of blue

Blue lips, blue veins

He took a step, but then felt tired
He said, "I'll rest a little while."
But when he tried to walk again
He wasn't a child
And all the people hurried past real fast
And no one ever smiled

Blue lips, blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away
Blue lips, blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away

He stumbled into faith and thought
"God, this is all there is."
The pictures in his mind arose
And began to breathe
And no one saw and no one heard
They just followed lead
The pictures in his mind awoke
And began to breed
They started off beneath the knowledge tree
Then they chopped it down to make white picket fences
And then marching along the railroad tracks
They smiled real wide for the camera lenses
They made it past the enemy lines
Just to become enslaved in the assembly lines

Blue lips, blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away
Blue lips, blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away
Blue, the most human color
Blue, the most human color
Blue, the most human color
Blue lips, blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away12Embed
