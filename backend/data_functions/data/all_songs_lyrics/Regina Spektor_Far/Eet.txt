Eet Lyrics
It's like forgetting
The words to your favorite song
You can't believe it
You were always singing along
It was so easy
And the words so sweet
You can't remember
You try to feel the beat

Eee-eee-eet, eet, eet
Eee-eee-eet, eet, eet

You spent half of your life
Trying to fall behind
You're using your headphones
To drown out your mind
It was so easy
And the words so sweet
You can't remember
You try to move your feet

Eee-eee-eet, eet, eet
Eee-eee-eet, eet, eet
Someone's deciding
Whether or not to steal
He opens the window
Just to feel the chill
He hears that outside
A small boy just started to cry
'Cause it's his turn
But his brother won't let him try


It's like forgetting
The words to your favorite song
You can't believe it
You were always singing along
It was so easy
And the words so sweet
You can't remember
You try to move your feet

It was so easy
And the words so sweet
You can't remember
You try to feel the beat6Embed
