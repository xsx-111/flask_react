Machine Lyrics
My eyes are bifocal
My hands are sept-jointed
I live in the future
In my prewar apartment
And I count all my blessings
I have friends in high places
And I'm upgraded daily
All my wires without traces

Hooked into machine
I'm hooked into hooked into
Hooked into machine
I'm hooked into
Hooked into machine

I collect my moments
Into a correspondence
With a mightier power
Who just lacks my perspective
And who lacks my organics
And who covets my defects
And I'm downloaded daily
I am part of a composite

Everything's provided
Consummate consumer
Part of worldly taking
Apart from worldly troubles
Living in your prewar apartment
Soon to be your postwar apartment
And you lived in the future
And the future
It's here
It's bright
It's now2Embed
