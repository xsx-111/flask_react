Human of the Year Lyrics
Hello? Hello?
Calling a Karl Projektorinski
To the front of the cathedral
You have won, dear sir
May I congratulate you first?
Oh, what an honor

Human, human of the year, and you won
Human, human of the year, and you won

Why are you so scared?
You stand there shaking in your pew
The icons are whispering to you
They're just old men
Like on the benches in the park
Except their balding spots
Are glistening with gold

Human, human of the year, and you won
Human, human of the year, and you won
Ah, ah, ah, won...
You have won
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Outside the cars are beeping out a song just in your honor
And though they do not know it all mankind are now your brothers
And thus the cathedral had spoken wishing well to all us sinners
And with a sigh grew silent 'till next year's big human winner
Outside the cars are beeping out a song just in your honor
And thought they do not know it all mankind are now your brothers
All mankind are now your brothers
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Hello? Hello?
Calling a Karl Projektorinski
To the front of the cathedral
You have won2Embed
