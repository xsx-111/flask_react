The Calculation Lyrics
You went into the kitchen cupboard
Got yourself another hour
And gave half of it to me
We sat there looking at the faces
Of the strangers in the pages
'Til we knew them mathematically

They were in our minds until forever
But we didn't mind, we didn't know better

So we made our own computer
Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking while we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called our calculation perfect love

Didn't even know that love was bigger
Didn't even know that love was so, so, hey hey hey

Hey, this fire
It's burning, burning us up
Hey, this fire
It's burning, burning us up
So we made the hard decision
And we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones
Saw our hearts were little stones
Pulled them out, they weren't beating
And we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on our granite counter top

We beat them up against each other
We beat them up against each other
We struck them hard against each other
We struck them so hard, so hard until they sparked

Hey, this fire
It's burning, burning us up
Hey, this fire
It's burning, burning us up
Hey, this fire
It's burning, burning us up
Oooh ohh oooh
Oooh ohh oooh
Oooh ohh oooh
Oooh ohh oooh4Embed
