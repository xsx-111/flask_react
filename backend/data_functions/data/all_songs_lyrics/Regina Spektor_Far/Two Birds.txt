Two Birds Lyrics
Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away
And the other watches him close from that wire
He says he wants to as well
But he is a liar

I'll believe it all
There's nothing I won't understand
I'll believe it all
I won't let go of your hand
Two birds on a wire
One says "C'mon" and the other says "I'm tired"
The sky is overcast and I'm sorry
One more or one less
Nobody's worried

I'll believe it all
There's nothing I won't understand
I'll believe it all
I won't let go of your hand
Two birds of a feather
Say that they're always gonna stay together
But one's never going to let go of that wire
He says that he will
But he's just a liar
Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away and the other
Watches him close from that wire
He says he wants to as well, but he is a liar

Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away and the other20Embed
