In Love Lyrics
I can't do a thing today
I can't see anyway
I haven't eaten all day

In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion

I can't listen to what you say
I can't understand you anyway
I haven't spoken all day

In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion

Felling good, felling bad
Felling happy, felling sad
I'm so happy, happy sad

In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion
I don't (?) your feelings
I do not need youEmbed
