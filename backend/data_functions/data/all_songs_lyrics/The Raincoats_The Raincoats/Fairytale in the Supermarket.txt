Fairytale in the Supermarket LyricsIt makes no difference
Night or day
No one teaches you how to live
Cups of tea are a clock
A clock, a clock, a clock
The times I forgot but never forgot
I don't know the books that you read
But you don't say that
Love never externalizes
You're rereading a book
To feel reassured
By the life of your favorite hero
But don't worry, honey don't worry
This is just a fairytale
Happening in the supermarket
The roots of your thoughts
They're essentially polaroidal
When you look at my picture
Don't say it's your mirror
Don't say we're both paranoid
Tear me - make me glad
Don't ask me anything
I'm no secret agent
Got no colours to give to you
But don't worry, honey don't worry
This is just a fairytale
Happening in the supermarketEmbed
