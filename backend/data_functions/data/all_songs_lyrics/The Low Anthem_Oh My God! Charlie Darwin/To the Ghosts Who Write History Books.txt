To the Ghosts Who Write History Books LyricsTo them ghosts that write history books
To them ghosts that write songs
Everyone asks would you write one about me
To them ghosts in the train yard
All them ghosts in my drink
Your money's no good here just write one about me
And when you go, where the winds are strong
When you go where flowers bend
Please take along all the best of my luck and come back unchanged
Your demons all tamed
Your flowers uncut
And when you go where the winds are strong
Where soldiers carve their stones
Please take along all the best of my luck and come back unchanged
Your demons all tamed
Your flowers uncut
To them ghosts that write history books
To them ghosts that write songs
Everyone asks would you write one about me
To them ghosts in the train yard
All them ghosts in my drink
Your money's no good here just write one about meEmbed
