OMGCD LyricsWhen I go, when I go
Sure don't know, where I'm going
I look up high, I look down low
Sure don't know where I'm going when I go
Do you job and I'll do mine
I'll do my best to hold the line
Do my best like Charlie said
You don't eat here, you're not to sleep, you hold the line
Oh my God, Oh my God, Charlie Darwin where are you now
I set these tiresome codes down where you lay
Oh my God, Oh my God, it ain't nothing but the cold hard ground
My better half will stay but I must goEmbed
