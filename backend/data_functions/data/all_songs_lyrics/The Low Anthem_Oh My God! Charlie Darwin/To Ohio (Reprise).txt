To Ohio (Reprise) LyricsI left Louisiana on the rail line, oo oo
I left Louisiana on the rail line, oo oo
I was trying to get to Ohio
Trying to get to Ohio
Lost my love before her time, oo oo
Lost my love before her time, oo oo
On the way to Ohio On the way to Ohio
Now every new love is just a shadow, oo oo
Every new love is just a shadow, oo oo
'Cause once you've known love you don't know how to find love, oo oo
Yeah once you've found love you don't know how to find new love
All the way to Ohio All the way to Ohio
Heard her voice come through the pines in Ohio
I heard her voice singing in the pines in Ohio
She sang bless your soul you crossed that line to Ohio
Bless your soul you crossed that line oo oo
All the way to Ohio
All the way to OhioEmbed
