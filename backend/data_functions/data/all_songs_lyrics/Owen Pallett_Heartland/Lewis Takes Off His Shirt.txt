Lewis Takes Off His Shirt LyricsAs soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math
Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath
The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take
I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head
I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you
I'm never gonna give it to you
I'm never gonna give it to you
Government rule established by a dazzling light show
A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo
I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides
I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way
Toward the range I'll ride, singing, I'm never gonna give it to you
I'm never gonna give it to you
I'm never gonna give it to you
"I am overrated" said the sculptress to the sea
"I've been praised for all the ways the marble leaves the man
And I was wrong to try and free him"
And as for me I am a vector I am muscle I am bone
The sun upon my shoulders and the horse between my legs
This is all I know
My senses are bedazzled by the parallax of the road
I concentrate to keep contained the overflow
My knuckles grip so tightly my fingers start to bleed
If what I have is what you need
I'm never gonna give it to you
I'm never gonna give it to you
I'm never gonna give it to youEmbed
