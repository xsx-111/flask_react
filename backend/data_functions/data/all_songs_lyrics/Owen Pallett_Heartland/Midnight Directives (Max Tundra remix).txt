Midnight Directives (Max Tundra remix) LyricsCross her off the shortlist
My blood is a red-winged bird
The way will be lit by the bridges we burn, oh
And come, tornado!
Carry me away from the croft
Ruffle my hair, bear my body aloft, oh
As the cutlass came down on a Saturday night
Left an un-planted field, left my daughter and wife
Called away into service, for a clerical life
Left an un-planted field, left my daughter and wife
Thought I was a sad-boy
Now I know, I know, I know I was wrong
Since you came along, I can see how content I had been
It'll drive a man crazy to age from the outside in
But I have a plan, it's a trick with a prick of a pin
And as the cutlass came down on a Saturday night
Left an un-planted field, left my daughter and wife
Called away into service, for a clerical life
Left an un-planted field, left my daughter and wife
For a man can be bought, and a man can be sold
And the price of a hundred thousand unwatered souls
Is a bit of meat and a bit of coal
It's a bit of meat and a bit of coal
It's a little bit of meat and coalEmbed
