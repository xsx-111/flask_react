Keep the Dog Quiet LyricsMy body is a cage
This union is cage about a cage about a cage
And this, and this town too
I'll see you once in a while but I can't be seen with you
This place is a narrative mess
The floor a tangle of bedsheets and battered sundress
The ink has dried in the well
The journey once was consequential
Now: sequential, sequential, sequential, sequential
When will you silence your hounds?
The eldest sons to the altar of the Eternal Sound
Their blood is spilled at the dawn
A nation bound to your will, still, the violin plays on
Plays its devotional song
Once it was, once it was so essential
Now: sequential, sequential, sequential, sequentialEmbed
