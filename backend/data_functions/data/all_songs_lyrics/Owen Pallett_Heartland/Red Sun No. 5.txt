Red Sun No. 5 LyricsI'd been living through days
Carrying no burden
But the shit of cattle
And my resignation
Until the sun rose crimson
Crept across my limbs and
I saw that they were earthen
That they decay and worsen
And from my ginger chest, there
Came the sound of thunder
I am not a father
I am not a farmer
I tremble to speak of it
Held her in my arms and
Pressed her to my heart and
Pressed my hand o'er her lips
I murmured words of his love
I will be his baron
With him I have an ending
With him I have completion
And the cover of nightEmbed
