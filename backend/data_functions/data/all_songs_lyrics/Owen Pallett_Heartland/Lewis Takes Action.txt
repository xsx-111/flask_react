Lewis Takes Action LyricsI got a message for the acolytes
I am your man in a bloody fight
I got a thirst for liquid gold
I'll bludgeon 'til the body's cold
The stony hiss of cockatrice has cast us into serfdom
I close my eyes, and spur Imelda down the mountainside
For a liberated Spectrum
I took No-Face by his beak and broke his jaw, he'll never speak again
I took No-Face by his beak and broke his jaw, he'll never speak again
My every move is guided by the bidding of the singer
The night is split by the whistle of my amber whip
And the fire from my fingersEmbed
