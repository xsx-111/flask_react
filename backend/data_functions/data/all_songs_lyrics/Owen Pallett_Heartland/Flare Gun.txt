Flare Gun LyricsThe wella woods of Belvedere
The peat and moss of Avenroe
St. Germain's canaries
The fortress of Alpentine
Oh my soul, my loyalty is to the East
And Spectral man, and bird, and beast
Red soil for the taking
Ruddy women for your brides
All good men of valourous heart
Consider a new start and sail today for the HeartlandEmbed
