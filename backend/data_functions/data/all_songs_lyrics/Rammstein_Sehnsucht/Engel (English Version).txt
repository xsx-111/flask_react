Engel (English Version) LyricsLive in virtue, no desire
In the grave an angel's choir
You look to heaven and wonder why
No one can see them in the sky
Just as the clouds have gone to sleep
Angels can be seen in heaven's keep
Alone in fear they question why
Goddamn not an angel when I die
Angels live, they never die
Apart from us, behind the sky
They're fading souls who've turned to ice
So ashen white in paradise
Just as the clouds have gone to sleep
Angels can be seen in heaven's keep
Alone in fear they question why
Goddamn not an angel when I die
Goddamn an angel when I die
Heaven must be hell in the sky1Embed
