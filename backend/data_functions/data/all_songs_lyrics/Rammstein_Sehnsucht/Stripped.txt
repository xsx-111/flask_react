Stripped Lyrics
Come with me into the trees
We'll lay on the grass and let hours pass
Take my hand, come back to the land
Let's get away just for one day

Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped

Metropolis has nothing on this
You're breathing in fumes, I taste when we kiss
Take my hand, come back to the land
Where everything's ours for a few hours

Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped

Let me hear you make decisions without your television
Let me hear you speaking just for me

Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped

Let me hear you make decisions without your television
Let me hear you speaking just for me

Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped2Embed
