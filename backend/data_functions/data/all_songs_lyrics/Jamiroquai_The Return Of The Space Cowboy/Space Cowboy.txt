Space Cowboy Lyrics
Everything is good and brown
I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends are close at hand
And all my inhibitions have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad, oh, that I found
Somebody who I can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy, interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high just to get by
You know I got that
I got that cheeba, cheeba kinda space cowboy vibe

Everything is good, oh, and green
Say, I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly, so high in sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad, oh, that he found
Somebody who he can rely on
This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I, hey
Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
He's got that, he's got that interplanetary, good
Good vibe zone

Oh, good times, hard times, good vibes, hey
Oh, I like what you're doing on that, yeah
This time

Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, interplanetary, good vibe zone
At the speed of cheeba, oh you and I
You and I go deeper, hey
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high this time
This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I, hey
We're going deeper, yeah
We're going deeper, yeah
We're going deeper, yeah
Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
Good times, hard times, good vibes, oh
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Yeah, I know from where it's comin' from
Now we've got people
At the speed of cheeba
You and I go deeper
I'll stay with you on this
On this interplanetary level
This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, hey, a good vibe zone
Speed, speed, at the speed of cheeba
Oh you and I, you and I, oh you and I go
Hey, hey, hey, you and I go deeper, deeper
I wanna go, I wanna go deeper with you
You know, you got that, you got the space cowboy vibe
Interplanetary, good vibes, good vibes, good times
At the speed of cheeba
Gotta go, gotta go, got to go4Embed
