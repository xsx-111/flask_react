Just Another Story Lyrics
Now, it occurred to me
As I awoke from deeper dreams
All this evolution
And still I don't know what it means
And it gets so hard for me to change
When there's an easy way to earn
Why should I work my fingers to the bone? (to the bone?!?)
Is this what I truly deserve?
This is not another trilogy
It's just another story
Just another story baby

Nobody make a move, this kid's got you covered
He was just seventeen, trying to get on like his dead brother
Mama couldn't do a thing about him
Though she hurt inside and daddy wants his son back
While him knows he's still alive
Stick up kid, thinking you're a glory boy
Oh, fronting that stupid toy
But you don't get that it's yourself you will destroy
Like a speed freak king of amphetamine
Still running those rocks on the front line
Get up tight when its your turn
A bullet in the head is the lesson learned
One of these days you're gonna say goodbye
Telling everyone you've never been so high
Born the same time that you die
You're pushing that draw like you're superfly
Heaven help all with no way out
That's what this is all about
This is not another trilogy
It's just another story, baby
Hit him with it now
Come on now hit him with it now
Stick up kid
Come on
Ahaha-ha-ha, I got you where I want ya!
Nobody make a fucking move!
All these gangster kids are getting uptight
All these gangster kids are getting uptight
I got ya! I got ya where I want ya now, nobody make a fucking move
Nobody make a move, oh, this kid's got you covered
He was just seventeen, trying to get on like his dead brother
Oh, mama couldn't do a thing about him, though she hurt inside
And Daddy wants his son back, while him knows he's still alive
Stick up kid, thinking you're a glory boy
Oh, fronting that stupid toy
But you don't get that it's yourself you will destroy
Still running those rocks on the front line
Like a speed freak king on amphetamine
Get up tight when its your turn
A bullet in the head is the lesson learned
One of these days you're gonna say goodbye
Telling everyone you've never been so high
Born the same time that you die
You're pushing that draw like you're superfly
This is just another story
All your broken glories
Say, oh, just another story, yeah
Somebody, somebody
Push it to the outer ridge
Everyday, everyday, happens everyday
This is not another trilogy
It's just another story
Come on now, push him, aw push him to that bridge now
Stick up kid
This is not another trilogy
It's just another storyEmbed
