Morning Glory LyricsOh, I'm gonna take my baby
Say I wanna go there
Won't you go to my morning glory?
All of my visions were untrue
Till I had a vision of you
And untimely end for all
But it was only then, only then that I saw
Saw the morning glory
Now, now, now I've seen that morning glory
Baby I've seen it, yeah
They want me, can't you take me there?
Away from soliloquies of sadness
And prophecies of pain and prophecies of pain
We're livin' for our own lives
For us all on this eve
I had a vision in my mind
I had a vision of peace
I had a vision of youEmbed
