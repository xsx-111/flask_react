Light Years LyricsLight years!
Light years away from the colour of our brotherhood!
Light years ahead would be a new solution! (Light years, light years)
Light years from our duty to assistance! (Light years, light years...)
Hey (can you dig it?)
So far, light years
Light years, light years
Light years, light years
Light years, light years
Light years, light years
Light years, light years
Light years, light years
And I'm not afraid to come in
You can be light years
Away from serious intention, yeah
See I thought I'd change it all
Some day
I'd get to turn mankind
This way, hey
If you don't know you can be light years
Away from your true destination
Hey
Until I get that good vibration
I'm never ever gonna get to use that
Earthly power
Hey
Say I'm gonna jump back
Stand back
And use that earthly power!
Oh, right on
All going up now
Now I've got that sunshine in my life
Ooh I got it, ooh I got it
Now I've got that sunshine in my life
Hey, now I got it, oh I got it
I g-g-g-g-g-g-got it
Now I've got that sunshine in my life
Oh! I was light years away
I was light years away
Now I've got that sunshine in my life
Hey, I was light years
Half a million miles from
What you want to be
Did you ever hear about the man
Who tried to be
Truly, truly free? Truly free?
You know what I mean
Oh, light years
Will stand between the laws of principle
Hey
And now we think we are invincible
But without true power
It's unthinkable man
But I'm gonna learn to use that
Jump back, stand back
And use that earthly power!
Hey, I was light years away
Oh, I was light years away
Light years away, light years away
Have you ever been light years away
From what you want to be
Who you want to be
What you want to be?
Ow!
Hey I'm going out now
Now I've got that sunshine in my life
Hey-yeah, light years away from
Where I wanted to be, but
Now I've got that sunshine in my life
Oh, I was light years, light years away
And I had to come back in
Now I've got that sunshine in my life
Oh, light years away, have you ever been
Light years away from where you want to be
From where you want to be, yeah?
Oh
Light years, light years
I was light years away
Now I've got that sunshine in my life
I was light years away
And I couldn't come back
Now I couldn't come back
Now I've got that sunshine in my life. (Some brothers ain't got a thing.)
Light years, light years
Light years, I g-g-g-g-g-g-got it
Now I've got that sunshine in my life
Ooh I was
Light years;
Light years away from the colour of our brotherhood!
Light years ahead would be a new solution!
Light years away from our duty to assistance!
Hey
Use it, you've got to use it
I want you to use that earthly power, yeah
We were all given
We were all given
Hey, earthly, earthly, earthly
Earthly power
And I'm gonna use my earthly power
See...
Oh, duty to assistance
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah
This song is all about it
All about our resistance
Hey, hey, hey!
Have you ever been light years away?
Have you ever been light years from who you want to be? (Do it again)
Do it again, do it again, do it again
I keep trying to come back in
But every time I do it again
I do it again, I do it again, I do it again
Oh, light years! Hey! Light years!
Light years away from the colour of our brotherhood! (Do it again, do it again...)
Y'all understand?
Light years away from who I am
Light years away from what you want to be...Embed
