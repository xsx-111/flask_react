Stillness In Time Lyrics
There’s a stillness in time
Which I cannot define
Does your heart bleed like mine
Oh, does your heart yearn
For a place we can go where the
Troubles of our time are far away
Hey, they are so far away
And I had all my life in front of me
Now my darkest days are trouble free
There are so many wondrous things for you to see

If you find that something’s going wrong
Look around at what you’re running from
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time

I found love in that way
And I’m never sad, and I’m always glad
Anything you give me today
I now will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
‘Cause they don’t know where they’re coming from
And there was nothing left to do but hang on
For that stillness in time
There’s a stillness in time
Search the spaces of my mind

If this world is turning too fast for your head
Just remember how bad times can roll instead
I guess I’ll have to search the spaces of my mind
For that stillness in time

I found love in that way
And I’m never sad, and I’m always glad
Anything you give me today
I now will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
‘Cause they don’t know where they’re coming from
And there was nothing left to do but hang on
For that stillness in time

Ooh
I know that this
Is the peripheral side of bliss
There is no name
For the love I have won’t stay the same
I have done wrong
If I don’t know where I’m coming from
If I don’t see, the things that are inside of me
A part of me, in front of me
Oh, say it’s all around me
Said I know
Said I want to find that
Stillness in time, stillness in time, hey!
La-la-la-la, la-la-lo-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-lo-la-la-la-la-lo, (repeat to end)Embed
