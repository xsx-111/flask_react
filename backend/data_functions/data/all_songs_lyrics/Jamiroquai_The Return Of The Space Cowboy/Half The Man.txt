Half The Man LyricsEvery bird will sing the melody of our love tune, oh
Yesterday I was half the man I'd used to be
Maybe that's because you're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom the summer of our love is soon
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Send down from above, unconditionally love
Likened to a flower, stronger love grows by the hour
Stormy weather days make us go our separate ways
Where our love was so at ease
Now you got me down on my knees, hey
Yesterday I was brighter than the mornin' sun
Now my love is lost and lonely days have just begun
A solitary chair for a silent love affair
A king has lost his throne, now he sits alone, hey hey
Oh, hey, every bird will sing, hey
Oh, now, every bird will sing
Every bird will sing the, sing the melody of the love tune
Oh, every bird, every bird
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune, hey
I wanna tell you, alright
Yesterday I was half the man I'd used to be
Oh, maybe that's because you're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom the summer of our love is soon, now
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Oh, yeah, ooh, every bird will sing the melody, the melody
Did I tell you? Darlin', yesterday I was half the man I'd used to be
Maybe that's because you're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom, the summer of our love is soon
Every bird will sing melody of our love tune
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Every bird, every bird
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tuneEmbed
