Halloween Lyrics
I hate living by the hospital
The sirens go all night
I used to joke that if they woke you up
Somebody better be dying
Sick of the questions I keep asking you
They make you live in the past
But I can count on you to tell me the truth
When you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask

Baby, it's Halloween
And we can be anything
Oh, come on, man
We can be anything

Always surprised by what I do for love
Some things I never expect
They killed a fan down by the stadium
Was only visiting, they beat him to death

Baby, it's Halloween
And we can be anything
Oh, come on, man
We can be anything
Baby, it's Halloween
There's a last time for everything
Oh, come on, man
We can be anything
Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
Whatever you want
Be whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
Whatever you want
Whatever you want10Embed
