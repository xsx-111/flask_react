Moon Song Lyrics
You asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
And now my feet can't touch the bottom of you

You couldn't have
You couldn't have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
So I will wait for the next time you want me
Like a dog with a bird at your door
Mmm

We hate Tears In Heaven
But it's sad that his baby died
And we fought about John Lennon
Until I cried
And then went to bed upset

But now I am dreaming
And you're singing at my birthday
And I've never seen you smiling so big
It's nautical themed
And there's something I'm supposed to say
But can't for the life of me
Remember what it is
And if I could give you the moon
I would give you the moon

You are sick and you're married
And you might be dying
But you're holding me like water in your hands
When you saw the dead little bird
You started crying
But you know the killer doesn't understand16Embed
