Cruel Lyrics
Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?

Forgive the kids
For they don't know how to live
Run the alleys, casually

Cruel, cruel

Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
If you could want that, too

They could take or leave you
So they took you and they left you
How could they be casually

Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh
Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh

Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
If you could want that, too
Then you'll be happy
You were the one waving flares in the air
So they could see you
And they were the zephyr blowing past you
Blowing fastly so they can't see you

Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh
Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh
Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh
Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh12Embed
