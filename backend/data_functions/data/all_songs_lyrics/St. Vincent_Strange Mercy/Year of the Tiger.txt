Year of the Tiger Lyrics
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

When I was young
Coach called me the tiger
(Oh, America, can I owe you one?)
I always had
A knack with the danger
(Oh, America, can I owe you one?)

Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger

Italian shoes
Like these rubes know the difference
Suitcase of cash
In the back of my stick shift
I had to be the best of the bourgeoisie
Now my kingdom for a cup of coffee

Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Oh, America, can I owe you one?
Oh, America, can I owe you one?
Oh, America, can I owe you one?
Oh, America, can I owe you one?

Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)3Embed
