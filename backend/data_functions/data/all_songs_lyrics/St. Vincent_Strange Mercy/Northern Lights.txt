Northern Lights Lyrics
If you say it is, then I guess it is
What you say it is, but I don't feel anything
'Cause your pendulum is in swing again
Yeah, your pendulum hasn't swung back in

It's a champagne year full of sober months
Through my maudlin days, through my dry moments

I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights

Gotta get young fast
Gotta get young quick
Gotta make this last
If it makes me sick

I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights2Embed
