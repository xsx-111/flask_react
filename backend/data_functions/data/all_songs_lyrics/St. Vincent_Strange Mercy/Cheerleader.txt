Cheerleader Lyrics
I've had good times with some bad guys
I've told whole lies with a half smile
Held your bare bones with my clothes on
I've thrown rocks, then hid both my arms

I don't know what good it serves
Pouring my purse in the dirt

But I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be your cheerleader no more
I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be your cheerleader no more

I've played dumb when I knew better
Tried too hard just to be clever
I know honest thieves I call family
I've seen America with no clothes on

But I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more

I don't know what I deserve
But, for you, I could work
'Cause I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a bird eater no more
I don't wanna be a dirt eater no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more8Embed
