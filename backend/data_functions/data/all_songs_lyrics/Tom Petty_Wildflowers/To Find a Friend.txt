To Find a Friend Lyrics
In the middle of his life
He left his wife
And ran off to be bad
Boy, it was sad

But he bought a new car
He found a new bar
And went under another name
Created a whole new game

And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend

Meanwhile then
His wife's boyfriend
Moved in and took over the house
Everybody was quiet as a mouse

And it changed their lives
Changed their plans
Slowly they grew apart
Boy, it woulda broke your heart
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend

And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend

And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friendEmbed
