Crawling Back to You Lyrics
Waiting by the side of the road
For day to break so we could go
Down into Los Angeles
With dirty hands and worn out knees

Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you

The ranger came with burning eyes
The chambermaid awoke surprised
Thought she'd seen the last of him
She shook her head, let him in

Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you

Hey baby, there's somethin' in your eyes
Tryin' to say to me
That I'm gonna be alright if I believe in you
It's all I want to do
It was me and my sidekick
He was drunk and I was sick
We were caught up in a barroom fight
'Til an Indian shot out the lights

I'm so tired of being tired
Sure as night will follow day
Most things I worry about
Never happen anyway

Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
I keep crawlin' back to youEmbed
