Hard on Me Lyrics
It's all I can do to keep that little girl smiling
And keep my faith alive
Takes all I got to hold on to tomorrow
And you want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me

Some other time, I'd be understanding
You were supposed to be
The friend that I needed when I was down
And now you want to make it hard
Yeah, you want to make it hard on me

Maybe if I tried, I could turn the other cheek
Maybe, but how big do I have to be?

You want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me

Maybe if I tried, I could turn the other cheek
Maybe, but how big do I have to be?
I need someone to put their arm around me
Shelter me from all harm
Just as I find something to believe in
You want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me

Yeah, you want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me2Embed
