She Lyrics
Nine in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you, like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to do

She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)

He takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away (Away, away)
And not telling his mates (Not telling his mates)
He wouldn't know what to say (Wouldn't know what to say, to say)

She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She)
She (She), she's the first one that I see (She)
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is (She, she)

Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head (Just in his head)
And she sleeps in his bed (His bed)
While he plays pretend (Pretend)
So pretend (Pretend)
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)
She (She), she's the first one that I see (She)
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is (She, she)
