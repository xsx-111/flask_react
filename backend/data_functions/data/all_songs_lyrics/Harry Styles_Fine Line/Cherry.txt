Cherry Lyrics
Coucou

Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

I, I confess I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that there's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment

Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?

Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
Don't you call him "baby" (Coucou)
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me (Coucou)

Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j'suis désolée...
Bah non... Nan, c'est pas important...
Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—
Parfait ! Allez !42Embed
