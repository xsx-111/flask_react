To Be So Lonely Lyrics
Don't blame me for falling
I was just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all

You can't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit, I was away
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry

Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

I just hope you see me in a little better light
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You’ll win, it's just a trick
And this is it, so I’m sorry

Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely

And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry

Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely42Embed
