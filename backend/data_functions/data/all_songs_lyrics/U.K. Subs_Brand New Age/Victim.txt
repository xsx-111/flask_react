Victim LyricsYou're a victim of day
Well I'm a victim of night
You're a victim of the accident
And I'm a victim of the fight
Well I don't mind being down on the ground
But it hurts to be pushed around
Like a victim
I'm the victim of hate
You're a victim of love
I'm a victim of jealousy
And it's burning me up
Well I don't mind you using me
But I never thought I'd be
Your victimEmbed
