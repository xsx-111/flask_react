Rat Race LyricsDo what you want and don't give a damn
There's a price to pay
And you keep on paying and paying and paying
And it never ends
You pay in the end, my friend
You drown yourself
In a barrel of beer
But when you pull out
The pressure pressure pressure
Yes it's dragging you down
And it just hangs around
It's a rat race baby
Faceless face
But if you're dying of hunger
You get in the race
It's a rat race baby
Faceless face
But if you're dying of hunger
You get in the race
Walk the streets
For some place you know
Knock on the door
But you already know the answer
Before they tell you no
It's a rat race baby
Faceless face
But if you're dying of hunger
You get in the race
It's a rat race baby
Faceless face
But if you're dying of hunger
You get in the race
Rat race baby
Faceless face..... Embed
