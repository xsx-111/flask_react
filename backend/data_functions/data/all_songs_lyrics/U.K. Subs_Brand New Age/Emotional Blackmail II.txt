Emotional Blackmail II LyricsNeedles, knives and bottles
Standing on the stair
I turn and walk the other way
There's nothing for me there
And now I can't go home
To razor cuts on bone
Rooms splashed with blood
Needles dipped in mud and
Emotional blackmail
Emotional blackmail
Emotional blackmail
Emotional blackmailEmbed
