New York State Police LyricsHeadlights flashing me
We’re the New York State Police
Slow down buddy, pull over there
We’re the New York State Police
Where you come from, are you putting me on
We’re the New York State Police
Okay boys, let's take him downtown
We’re the New York State Police
82nd precinct boys
82nd precinct boys
82nd precinct boys
We're the boys making all the noise
Get those boxes out of the truck
We're the New York State Police
If Morella's in it'll be our luck
We're the New York State Police
We ain't green we ain't boy scouts
We're the New York State Police
We know if you're holding out
We're the New York State Police
82nd precinct boys
82nd precinct boys
82nd precinct boys
We're the boys making all the noise
Got you on the TV screen
We're the New York State Police
OK boys now keep it clean
We're the New York State Police
Empty your pockets, take off your clothes
We're the New York State Police
Keep your mouth shut or we'll break your nose
We're the New York State Police
82nd precinct boys
82nd precinct boys
82nd precinct boys
We're the boys making all the noiseEmbed
