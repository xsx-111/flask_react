500 CC LyricsRiding on my Trident with my cycle slut
Going up to Scouse land but the town was shut
Gonna ride the ferry to the Isle of Man
Gonna ride the TT gonna to try my hand
Hold on here we go hear my motor cut
500 CC and a cycle slut
Now the sun is shining and we're on our way
My baby took some time off for a holiday
Saving all our pennies for some gasoline
People say we're dirty but I keep my motor clean
Hold on to me baby I'm going to open up
500 CC and a cycle slut
My baby sees this fella on a mean machine
It must be over thirteen hundred CC
She tells she can't read the name but see if you can
It was a Kawasaki and it's made in Japan
Hold on to me baby I'm going to open up
500 CC and a cycle slut
Now the sun is shining and we're on our way
My baby took some time off for a holiday
Saving all our pennies for some gasoline
People say we're dirty but I keep my engine cleanEmbed
