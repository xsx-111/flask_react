Teenage LyricsBaby won't you buy me a brand new suit
Like they wore in '62
I wanna be in the latest craze
I wanna be in the news
Wanna get my name on the front page
'Cos my suit was all the rage

Teenage
I wanna be teenage
I wanna be teenage
I wanna be
Baby won't you buy me a pair of wheels
Ten lights and shiny chrome steel
You can be my Lambretta lover
Put your fox furs on my grill
Get your face on the TV screen
You know you're my teenage dream

Baby won't you buy me a real flash car
Tail fins and wire mag wheels
We'll ride on down the freeway
With the police on our heels
Flashing on their speed trap screen
Fastest thing they've ever seen
