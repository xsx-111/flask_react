Left For Dead LyricsI'm hanging on a limbo tree
All the birds they shit on me
Somebody get a knife
Cut me down don't leave me here for dead
For dead
For dead
For dead
Pull me out and lock the door
Don't wanna go back any more
Wasn't anything you said
Don't care if you leave me here for dead
For dead
For dead
For dead
You never wanna take a chance
Nobody's gonna watch you dance
Imagine that they don't exist
You might as well give it up for dead
For dead
For dead
For deadEmbed
