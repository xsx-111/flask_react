Same Thing LyricsDo you wanna come around
Come and see what's going down
Don't you wanna get away from here
Disco beat is all we hear
Same thing every day
I got some money but I'm turned away
Same feeling's gotta change
Getting sick of feeling strange
Do you wanna
Will it be alright
Go to the city
We can stay all night
Oh
Same thing every day
I got some money but I'm turned away
Same feeling's gotta change
Getting sick of feeling strange
Do you ever get to feel
You're just a number and nothing's real
Do you wanna say it's OK
Tomorrow's just another day
Same thing every day
I got some money but I'm turned away
Same feeling's gotta change
Getting sick of feeling strangeEmbed
