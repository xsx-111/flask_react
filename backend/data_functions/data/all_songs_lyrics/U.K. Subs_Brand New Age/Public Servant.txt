Public Servant LyricsPublic servant
Number one
Sits in Whitehall
Is waited on
Do they know something
We don't know
Public servant
Number two
Sits in Whitehall
With nothing to do
Do they know something
We don't know
Chief of staff
In a big black car
Buying arms
For his jungle war
Does he know something
That we don't know
We don't know
Do they know something
We don't know
Take your money
Again and again
Are you working for you
Are we working for them
Do they know something
We don't know
We don't know
We don't know
We don't knowEmbed
