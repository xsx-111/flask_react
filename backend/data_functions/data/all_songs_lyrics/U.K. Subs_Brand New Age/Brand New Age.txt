Brand New Age LyricsGot a feeling someone's watching me
From the supermarket store playing hide and seek
Hanging on the ceiling and they never sleep
Everywhere I go I see this silver machine
1980's a brand new age
1980's a brand new age
Anonymous people going nowhere
Being recorded by machines in the air
Closed circuit TV
Closed circuit TV
Closed circuit TV
Closed circuit TV
Is the future going to be a nightmare?
Everywhere you go they're always there
Watching, listening to every word
The past was an omen now the future's a curse
1980's a brand new age
1980's a brand new age
There's no such thing as a private life
They watch you in the crib
Now they're going to watch you die
Closed circuit TV
Closed circuit TV
Closed circuit TV
Closed circuit TV
It's a brand new age
It's a brand new age
It's a brand new age
It's a brand new ageEmbed
