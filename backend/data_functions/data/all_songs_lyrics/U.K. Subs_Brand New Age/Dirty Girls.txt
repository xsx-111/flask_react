Dirty Girls LyricsAll the nice girls on my street
Never talk to me
I Ain't got a thing for nice girls
And they ain't got a thing for me
Night time comes I'm on my way
On the subway to the city
Those dirty girls never say no
Maybe that's why I love 'em so
They go yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Saturday night is party night
In a city that never sleeps
London is a rush
Like New York on speed
The girls inside the Marquee
All dressed up to go
Outside the Music Machine
They never tell you no
They go yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Night times here I'm on my way
On the subway to the city
Those dirty girls never say no
Maybe that's why I love 'em so
They go yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeahEmbed
