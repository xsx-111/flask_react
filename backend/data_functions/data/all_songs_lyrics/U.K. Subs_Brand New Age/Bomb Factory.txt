Bomb Factory LyricsThere's a bomb in London
There's a bomb in Belfast
There's a bomb in Berlin
There's a bomb in Paris
And it's burning down your world
There's a bomb in New York
There's a bomb in Hong Kong
There's a bomb in Russia
There's a bomb in Iraq
And it's burning down your world
And it's burning down your world
There's a timebomb and it's ticking away
There's a fuse and it's burning today
There's a factory
And they're working all night
On timers, fuses and gelignite
They're burning down your world
They're burning down your world
There's a bomb in Spain
A bomb in Israel
A bomd in Russia
And it's burning burning burning burning down your worldEmbed
