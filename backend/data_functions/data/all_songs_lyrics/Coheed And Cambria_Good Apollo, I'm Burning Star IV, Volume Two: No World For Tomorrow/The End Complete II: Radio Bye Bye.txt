The End Complete II: Radio Bye Bye Lyrics
We're throwing all caution to the wind
It's better to think about what's ahead, than behind them
Only I've got a better chance at failure
But my mind has a clever way
Of turning all the worst to right, I've found

Oh no, so tell them like you did it
No maybes

We'll leave it on the radio, we're calling all cowards
Now boy, that you made it, so
Why are you afraid of what you've done?
We'll leave it on the radio, we're calling all cowards
Now boy, that you made it, so
Why are you afraid of what you've done?
No, what you've done, no...

Return to the dirt with this cursed affair
A lever to pull upon and the buried, we'll leave there
Only how will they ever find their way
To the road, to a better place?
Where the memories, they don't live to fade away
Oh no, so tell them like you did it
Oh no, so tell them like you knew
Ditto, so tell them like you knew
No maybes

We'll leave it on the radio, we're calling all cowards
Now boy, that you made it, so
Why are you afraid of what you've done?
We'll leave it on the radio, we're calling all cowards
Now boy, that you made it, so
Why are you afraid of what you've done?


Like you, it's the curse of the radio bye-bye
Like you, it's the curse of the radio bye-bye
Like you, it's the curse of the radio bye-bye
Like you knew

Oh no, so tell them like you did it
Oh no, so tell them like you knew
Ditto, so tell them like you knew
No maybes
We'll leave it on the radio, we're calling all cowards
Now boy, that you made it, so
Why are you afraid of what you've done?
We'll leave it on the radio, we're calling all cowards
Now boy, that you made it, so
Why are you afraid of what you've done?
We'll leave it on the radio, we're calling all cowards
Now boy, that you made it, so
Why are you afraid of what you've done?
We'll leave it on the radio, we're calling all cowards
Now boy, that you made it, so
Why are you afraid of what you've done?Embed
