Justice in Murder Lyrics
Is this the way I want them seeing me?
Please, leave your memories at the door
Why has the world gone off and deserted me?
Why, there's just no room inside these walls

You want it all, but did you want it tonight?
Oh, you don't remember as you wait by the light
Oh, can you see what you've been asking of me?
With the turn of this knife, no, I will take your life
This ain't a crime, no, I'm calling for mercy
Now it's time, please pray for me...

There will be justice in murder
There will be justice in murder
Now, you've been for me what no other could be
Will I now grow old, to forget all those?
Blow off sorrow, goodbye tomorrow

There is no worse than this curse they've given me
This mule's seen its end in love and war
I'll wish you the best when I'm lost to eternity
Now do what you will, so it hurts no more
You want it all, but did you want it tonight?
Oh, you don't remember as you wait by the light
Oh, can you see what you've been asking of me?
With the turn of this knife, no, I will take your life
This ain't a crime, no, I'm calling for mercy
Now it's time, please pray for me...

There will be justice in murder
There will be justice in murder
Now, you've been for me what no other could be
Will I now grow old, to forget all those?
Blow off sorrow, goodbye tomorrow


There will be justice in murder
There will be justice in murder
Now, you've been for me what no other could be
Will I now grow old, to forget all those?
Blow off sorrow, goodbye tomorrow
