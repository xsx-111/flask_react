The Running Free Lyrics
All non-believers, stand aside in fear
A new day is marching through the door
How could you ever think you'd make it here?
Oh, did it bleed? Or was it sore?
Through the struggles you've endured?

You've come so far from innocence
Provided all the consequence
Only what does it matter now?

Cause you're going home, you're running free
As only you would be, if you never owed them anything
And now, you've found your way out
In the trust you've seen your path on home
(Oh, whoa)

(Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Spend your time well before you go
(Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Here in Hell

Your living ends before the engineer
What was your motive in this fight?
(Did they play you for the weaker of them?)
How could you ever think you'd make it here?
Was it greed that pushed your heart through the struggles you've endured?
You've come so far from innocence
Provided all the consequence
Only what does it matter now

Cause you're going home, you're running free
As only you would be, if you never owed them anything
And now, you've found your way out
In the trust you've seen your path on home
(Oh whoa)

(Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Spend your time well before you go
(Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Here in Hell

(There's a Hell in all of us)
Spend your time well before you go
(There's a Hell in all of us)
In a loss that's all your own
(There's a Hell in all of us)
There are no secrets you can hide
(There's a Hell in all...)
From yourself, in your mind, leave the worst of all behind
Cause you're going home
You're running free
As only you would be, if you never owed them anything
And now, you've found your way out
In the trust you've seen your path on home
Cause you're going home
You're running free
As only you would be, if you never owed them anything
And now, you've found your way out
In the trust you've seen your path on home
(Oh whoa)

(Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Spend your time well before you go
(Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Here in Hell1Embed
