Feathers Lyrics
History's made its mark in anger
As everybody knows, it's what we do
It's nothing new
The next chords struck are fault and failure
And we both know that finger points on cue
There's blame for two
Do you really want him calling, Newo?
Do you really think he's coming back to you?
Oh, once the world stops spinning
Read that writing on the wall
(Is there) Another, Newo?
Is there cushion just enough to break the fall?
Oh, don't you cry, just lie there baby, in the past
'Cause if you want it all...

Right now, hide your feathers on the back porch, baby
He's coming home, for you've been such a liar
Hide your feathers, little back porch lady
You’re too old enough to cry your sorry eyes out
(Over the world)
Hear me scream, outside your window
I’m only here to make my peace with you
There’s something new
It was our time, that day in our lives
If I could do things different, what would I choose?
Oh, don't you cry, mama, please don't cry, mama
Oh, don't you cry, no, no

Right now, hide your feathers on the back porch, baby
He's coming home, for you've been such a liar
Hide your feathers, little back porch lady
You're too old enough to cry your sorry eyes out

No other could wait for a lover to embrace, boy
When there's no more room for love
You'll sell her off to the sharks
No other could wait for a lover to embrace, boy
When there's no more room for love
You'll sell her off to the sharks

Right now, hide your feathers on the back porch, baby
He's coming home, for you've been such a liar
Hide your feathers, little back porch lady
You're too old enough to cry your sorry eyes out
Wait a minute, little back porch lady
Wait a minute, little back porch lady, I'm in love
Wait a minute, little back porch lady (Such a liar)
Oh, don't you cry, mama, oh, don't you cry, no no
Wait a minute, little back porch lady
Wait a minute, little back porch lady, I'm in love
Wait a minute, little back porch lady (Such a liar)
Oh, don't you cry, mama, oh, don't you cry, no no1Embed
