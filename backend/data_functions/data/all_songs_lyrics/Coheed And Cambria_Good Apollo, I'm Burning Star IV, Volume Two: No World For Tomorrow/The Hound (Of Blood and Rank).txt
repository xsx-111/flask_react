The Hound (Of Blood and Rank) Lyrics
Was it in the cold of that knife you screwed
In the heart of the enduring?
â€˜Cause when you opened that door, you knew
Well now, there'd be no returning
Or room to mourn what we have lost
To wait while the willing
As you're the hound of blood and rank
And boy, you've got another thing coming

Come on, come on, come on
You've got to give it to me
As though you want it to
Come on and set me free

I'll dig it 'til we've made your grave
Oh, you've been a bad, bad boy
I'll cut it 'til I carve it out
And stick it in a sad, sad song
Why the bother? You're no brother
You're the wrong I need
Boy, we all found an audience, while
You found the worst of me, you got another thing
Put 'em up against the wall, now they're of no use to you
God, it's time for the curing
Only you're in for that big refuse
Surprise, boy! This tide's come a-turning
No room to mourn what you have lost
Oh, no waiting while the willing
Poor little hound of blood and rank
Who deserves every ounce of what's coming

Come on, come on, come on
You've got to give it to me
As though you want it to
Come on and set me free

I'll dig it 'til we've made your grave
Oh, you've been a bad, bad boy
I'll cut it 'til I carve it out
And stick it in a sad, sad song
Why the bother? You're no brother
You're the wrong I need
Boy, we all found an audience, while
You found the worst of me, you got another thing

Come on, come on, come on
You've got to give it to me
As though you want it to
Come on and set me free

I'll dig it 'til we've made your grave
Oh, you've been a bad, bad boy
I'll cut it 'til I carve it out
And stick it in a sad, sad song
Why the bother? You're no brother
You're the wrong I need
Boy, we all found an audience, while
You found the worst of me, you got another thing

We caught you on the wrong side of lying
Within the dust, we left you dying
If only words can keep you hiding
Well, go on, cowards, we've offed you
Cowards, we've offed you
(I hope your life's a living hell) It's all on you, boy
(I hope your life's a living hell) It's all on you, boy
(I hope your life's a living hell) It's all on you, boy
(I hope your life's a living hell) It's all on you, boy
(I hope your life's a living hell) It's all on you, boy
(I hope your life's a living hell) It's all on you, boy
(I hope your life's a living hell) It's all on you, boyEmbed
