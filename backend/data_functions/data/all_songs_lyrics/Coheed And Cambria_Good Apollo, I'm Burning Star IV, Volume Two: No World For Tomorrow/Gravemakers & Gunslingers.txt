Gravemakers & Gunslingers Lyrics
So draw, little piggy, better watch out for number one
(I fear there's a bad wind blowing through there)
You better put up the shutters, 'cause Lord knows
Now, I ain't stopping 'til the worst gets alive
Little strutter, don't you creep out that fucking rut
(It's best that you don't go walking, through there)
Now please a don't bother knocking
'Cause God knows I ain't now stopping 'til you breathe none

(Hey!) What I miss?
We're one and the same
Just give it the push while I kick-start
(There's just no time for this)

Come on! It's just the hurt I'm looking for
I don't wanna live, no more
You've got the gun, I've got the bullets
Don't wanna live, no more
Oh baby, be my lover
Go on and pull that trigger!
You're the sin of this city, now repent for the wrong you've done
(I'm not sorry for this, not sorry at all)
You're a snake under cover
No room for another, just these bad motherfuckers
Leave a long trail of nothing, little bad boy with gun in hand
(It's best that you don't go walking, through there)
Now, please a-come boy, a-popping
'Cause God knows I ain't now stopping 'til you breathe none

(Hey!) What I miss?
We're one and the same
Just give it the push while I kick-start
(There's just no time for this)

Come on! It's just the hurt I'm looking for
I don't wanna live, no more
You've got the gun, I've got the bullets
Don't wanna live, no more
Oh baby, be my lover
Go on and pull that trigger!
Let's flood out the weasel's hole
(Oh, Christ will you bury my body?)
To choke out all the lies it's told
(Oh, Christ will you bury my body?)
With time, hope the hurt gets old
(Oh, Christ will you bury my body?)
Let's fuck out the weasel's hole
(Oh, Christ will you bury my body?)

We'll keep marching to the top of this tower
As God isn't at home, no
There's nothing in the way that could stop us
It's your time to go

(Hey!) What I miss?
We're one and the same
Just give it the push while I kick-start
(There's just no time for this)

Come on! It's just the hurt I'm looking for
I don't wanna live, no more
You've got the gun, I've got the bullets
Don't wanna live, no more
Oh baby, be my lover
Go on and pull that trigger!
I don't wanna live, no more
Go on and pull that trigger!
Don't wanna live, no more
Be my lover go on and pull that trigger!Embed
