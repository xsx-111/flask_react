The End Complete V: On the Brink LyricsThe worlds have now learned of the worst yet to come
On the brink of an end, a boy learns to run
How you love, or could you, "Mr. Man of the Year"?
Walking tall, with nothing to fear
Don't pass up this chance, oh, go tear down the walls
No Gods will be watching, no one cares enough, at all
These words need now an ending, as they did at the start
But I'll keep on pretending I won't go
Don't cry no more, boy
You've got the other side of your life, so enjoy
I'll move out the front door and take out your trash
But I'll no longer be haunting here, I'm not coming back
The world must know my story
So long, Amory
Please drive me home, one last time
