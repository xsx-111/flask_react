The End Complete III: The End Complete Lyrics
These are the days, the end complete
A world still turning to the sound of the suffering
You are the jury, we are the saints
Our minds divide, the past repeats
A war still brewing in the hearts of those we once bled
I am the knowing, the living dead

Dig deeper, remember
All you've been and all you've left behind
Wave goodbye, my dear
Dig deeper, remember
All you've been and all you've left behind
Welcome home, my dear

No words to say, the worst displayed
What once was courage is now cursed in the hurt we've made
We are the sinners, before our graves
Now leave in peace, the dead unsaved
A world still turning down the path, towards the end complete
Now spite me, jury, we've come for change
Dig deeper, remember
All you've been and all you've left behind
Wave goodbye, my dear
Dig deeper, remember
All you've been and all you've left behind
Welcome home, my dear

Momma
I'm living proof that never is just around the corner
A ghost to walk the end, designed for you and I
No one will ever know

We are the fate of killers, the call of justice!
We are now waiting, while you wish us away with your plans
In hope deliverance won't save your soul from Satan
GOD! He will not save you
IS NOT! He will not save you
HERE! He will not save you from this
GOD! He will not save you
IS NOT! He will not save you
HERE! He will not save you from this
You've been stealing my lines
Now, go on living your lies
For on your knees, you will find
You'll face a jury in hell
We are the fate of killers, the call of justice!
We are now waiting, while you wish us away with your plans
In hope deliverance won't save your soul from Satan
GOD! He will not save you
IS NOT! He will not save you
HERE! He will not save you from this
GOD! He will not save you
IS NOT! He will not save you
HERE! He will not save you from this
You've been stealing my lines
Now, go on living your lies
For on your knees, you will find
You'll face a jury in hell

Those were the days, the end complete
The world is burning to the sound of the suffering
You are the jury, we are the saints
Dig deeper, remember
All you've been and all you've left behind
Wave goodbye, my dear
Dig deeper, remember
All you've been and all you've left behind
Welcome home, my dear

You were the magic that turned a curse in time
You were the beauty that we had to leave behind
Oh no, bye bye

We're going to get you, my love
We're going to get you, my love
Oh no, let your rabbit go run
Oh no, let your rabbit go run
We're going to get you, my love
We're going to get you, my love
Oh no, let your rabbit go run
Oh no, let your rabbit go run
We're going to get you, my loveEmbed
