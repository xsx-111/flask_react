Mother Superior Lyrics
Here, sleep at the bottom of Hell
Your time has come to pick the road
You'll walk in this tale
Turned and as a coward, you've learned
Through sickness and health, there's only one
Now go and bite your tongue

You'll just say the worst of me, with a hope they'll understand
No, they know you're just a boy, so grow up and be a man
Little baby, kicking, you scream and whine
Victims pay the price, eventually - the cost? Let's see... your life
You've got nothing to prove
Stay afraid, young brother
You've got nothing to prove

Your answer is in there, just stare down the barrel
Your sincerest apologies won't write you out of this one
Tonight, you'll find the right
In the pull of the trigger, now bite
Young fools, don't cry anymore
A fear sleeps inside your stomach, it swells
A torn boy alone, in need of fix
And the pinch that cures the itch
For too long, this little baby has cried on
For tomorrow, we'll sing the words and song
Of a time we're glad's long gone

You'll just say the worst of me, with a hope they'll understand
No, they know you're just a boy, so grow up and be that man
Little baby, kicking, you scream and whine
Victims pay the price, eventually - the cost? Let's see... your life
You've got nothing to prove
Stay afraid, young brother
You've got nothing to prove

Your answer is in there, just stare down the barrel
Your sincerest apologies won't write you out of this one
Tonight, you'll find the right
In the pull of the trigger, now bite
Young fools, don't cry
Mother Superior, come catch the rabbit, he runs
My, how've you been?
You're frightened of leaving this truly gone-fishing amalgam
Go fetch your gun

Your answer is in there, just stare down the barrel
Your sincerest apologies won't write you out of this one
Tonight, you'll find the right
In the pull of the trigger, now bite
Young fools, don't cry

Not anymore, don't cry, boy
Not anymore, don't cry, boy
Not anymore, don't cry, boy
When you're sick to the stomach
Just pull out the knife, oh no
Don't cry, boy
Not anymore, don't cry, boy
Not anymore, don't cry, boy
When you're sick to the stomach
Just pull out the knife, oh noEmbed
