The End Complete IV: The Road and the Damned Lyrics
I believed, in the world right in front of me
But now, along these empty streets
Where this curse haunts these memories
Of a man and all he's lost

No time to think about it
No room to breathe

If I had a way back, I'd ride through the dark and the dawn
(But please don't wait for me)
Because the man you love don't live, anymore
I can't go home, again

Tonight, you'll sleep
No fear of what might become of me, my dear
Within these end of days
Where this longing turns this man to prey
On a love that yearns to die

No time to live and doubt it
Girl, I'm worth the second chance
(What have I done?)
No time to think about it
No room to breathe

If I had a way back, I'd ride through the dark and the dawn
(But please don't wait for me)
Because the man you love don't live, anymore
I can't go home, again

I believed in the world once in front of me
But now, that's gone

If I had a way back, I'd ride through the dark and the dawn
(But please don't wait for me)
Because the man you love don't live, anymore
(I can't go home, again)
If I had a way back, I'd ride through the dark and the dawn
(But please don't wait for me)
Because the man you love don't live, anymore
I can't go home, again

Bye, goodbye
Bye, goodbye
Bye, goodbye
Goodbye
Bye, goodbye
Bye, goodbye
Bye, my dearEmbed
