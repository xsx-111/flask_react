(Manifest) LyricsI want to call requests through heating vents
And hear them answered with a whisper, ”No”
To crack the code of muscles, slacken, tense
Let every second step in boots on snow
Complete your name with accents I can’t place
That stumble where the syllables combine
Take depositions from a stranger’s face
Paint every insignificance a sign
So tell me nothing matters, less or more
Say ”Whatever we think actions are
We'll never know what anything was for
If near is just as far away as far”
And I’m permitted one act I can save
I choose to sit here next to you and waveEmbed
