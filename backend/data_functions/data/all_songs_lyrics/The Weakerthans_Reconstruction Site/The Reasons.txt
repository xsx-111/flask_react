The Reasons LyricsHow I don't know how to sing
I can barely play this thing
But you never seem to mind
And you tell me to fuck off
When I need somebody to
How you make me laugh so hard
How whole years refuse to stay
Where we told them to, bad dog
Locked up whining in a word
Or a misplaced souvenier
How the past chews on your shoes
And these memories lick my ear

I know
You might roll your eyes at this
But I'm so
Glad that you exist
How we waste our precious time
Marching in the picket lines
That surround those striking hearts
How the time is never now
And we know who we should love
But we're never certain how
I know
You might roll your eyes at this
But I'm so
Glad that you exist

I know
You might roll your eyes at this
But I'm so
Glad that you exist

I know
You might roll your eyes at this
But I'm so
Glad that you existEmbed
