Uncorrected Proofs LyricsThe mirrors and the unacknowledged nods
Dial tones and license plates
The words you didn't choose
Everything the day's too small to hold
Spills on to the dusk
And shorts the evening's fuse
So you fumble for a voice
And sing happy birthday
Read it to yourself again
The stories always end the same
He can't stay and she won't run
And fear is where they're calling from
Staunch the blood from countless tiny cuts
We're all out of bandages
The heaters' rattle, taunt
Sifting through translucent shards of glass
Looking for a filament
That lit the life you want
So you stumble for the phone
Grasp the cord and pull
Will your readership complain the stories always end the same?
She can't stay and he won't run, and fear is where they're calling from
Afraid is where where they're calling from
Afraid is where we live for far too long (Afraid is where we live for far too long)Embed
