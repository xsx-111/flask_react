A New Name for Everything LyricsWhen the bus shelter windows and napkin dispensers surprise
With distorted reflections, it's never the someone you're hoping to recognize
And the rent is too high living here between reasons to live
Where you can't sleep alone and your memories groan and the borders of night start to give
When you can't save
Cash or conviction, you're broke and you're breaking
A tired shoelace or a wave
So long past past-due, a new name for everything
When the one-ways collude with the map that you folded wrong
And the route you abandoned is always the path that you probably should be upon
When the bottle cap ashtrays and intimates' ears are all full
With results of your breath, and the threads of your fear are unfurled with the tiniest pull
One more time, try
Stand with your hands in your pockets and stare
At the smudge on a newspaper sky
And ask it to rain a new name for everything
Fire every phrase
They don't want to work for us anymore
Dot and dash our days
Make your face the flag of a semaphore
All you won't show
The boxes you brought here and never unpacked are still patiently waiting to go
So put on those clothes you never grew into, and smile like you mean it for once
If you come back, bring a new name for everything
A new name for everything
A new name for everythingEmbed
