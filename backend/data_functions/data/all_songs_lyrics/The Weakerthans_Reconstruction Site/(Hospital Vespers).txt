(Hospital Vespers) LyricsDoctors played your dosage like a card trick
Scrabbled down the hallways yelling ”Yahtzee!”
I brought books on Hopper, and the Arctic
Something called "The Politics of Lonely"
A toothbrush and a Quick Pick with the plus
You tried not to roll your sunken eyes
And said ”Hey can you help me? I can't reach it”
Pointed at the camera in the ceiling
I climbed up, blocked it so they couldn't see
Turned to find you out of bed, and kneeling
Before the nurses came, took you away
I stood there on a chair and watched you prayEmbed
