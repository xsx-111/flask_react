Our Retired Explorer (Dines with Michel Foucault in Paris, 1961) LyricsJust one more drink and then I should be on my way home
I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about
I've had a really nice time, but my dogs need to be fed
I must say that in the right light, you look like Shackleton
Comment allez-vous ce soir?
Je suis comme ci comme Ã§a
Yes, a penguin taught me French
Back in Antarctica
I could show you the way shadows colonize snow
Ice breaking up on the bay off the Lassiter coast
Light failing over the pole as every longitude leads
Up to your frostbitten feet, oh, you're very sweet
Thank you for the flowers
And the book by Derrida
But I must be getting back
To dear Antarctica
Say, do you have a ship and a dozen able men
That maybe you could lend me?
Oh, Antarctica
Oh, Antarctica
Oh, Antarctica
Oh, AntarcticaEmbed
