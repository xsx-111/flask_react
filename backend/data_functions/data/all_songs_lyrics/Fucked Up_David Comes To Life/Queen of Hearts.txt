Queen of Hearts Lyrics
Sun rises above the factory
But the rays don't make it to the street
Through the gates come the employees
Beat down and draggin' their feet
Lefties handin' pamphlets, workers comin' in
Two people on the pavement never be the same again

She placed it in his hand
Well they must have seen the sparks
Neither understands
What just happened to their hearts

Another mornin' of this place has ripped me out of my dreams
Realizin' life's a waste as the whistle blows off steam
One thing I'm betting on, nothin's ever gonna change
Itâ€™s like our progress has just stalled and everyday's the same

She placed it in my hand
Co-workers seen the sparks
I couldn't understand
What just happened to my heart
Hello, my name is David, your name is Veronica
Let's be together, let's fall in love
Hello, my name is David, your name is Veronica
Let's be together, 'til the stars go out

Well all we need is for somethin' to give
The dam bursts open, we suddenly live
The boot off my throat, life is returning
The boot off my throat, let's all emote

Dawn breaks across this town and a new dawn breaks for me
Take the pains of the underclass
Tryin' to smile through gritted teeth
We must now all join up and throw off the shackles of shame
United we can't be defeated
They shall hear us proclaim

I placed it in his hand
Comrades seen the sparks
Couldn't understand what happened to my heart

Hello, your name is David, I am Veronica
Let's be together, until the water swallows us
Hello, you must be David, I am Veronica
Let's be together, until we're all finally crushed
Well all we need is for somethin' to give
The dam bursts open, we suddenly live
The boot off my throat, life is returning
The boot off my throat, let's emote
Well all we need is for somethin' to give
The dam bursts open, we suddenly live
The boot off my throat, life is returning
The boot off my throat, let's emoteEmbed
