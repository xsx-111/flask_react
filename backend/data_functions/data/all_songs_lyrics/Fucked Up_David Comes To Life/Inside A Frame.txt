Inside A Frame LyricsA vengeful angel flies around the sun
Drippin' his wax down on those that watch
Feathers falling next, they're dancing around
Such a graceful decent, so unlike his own
Crashing down to earth
Destruction in his wake he caused
There I go again, trying to narrate
So I could hide my role
Have to own up, have to concede
They used me like you
We all have our jobs, markers of our fate
That dictate our place
But now I know it's not his fault
How could I (?) responsible?
So wrought by what I've done
Wouldn't wish it on anyone
What of the man with the wooden god?
Never did him good
But never steered him wrong
Can't claim the same
The blood on my hands
Marks my guilt, exposes my crimes
I've played with lives
Like the Gods of old
But I'm no God
I'm just a fool
Leader of the mob
King of the swayed, culpable
The moms and dads who turned to me
Now hold their torches at my door
Try to alleviate the burden of my guilt
Never really had agency
I'm just a false prophet, just a heretic
Powerless without your belief
(Chorus)
A young couple meets and falls in love
And live so happily, it's a platitude
But it's a lie, affections unrequited
Presence someone else will complicate
The best laid plans of invertebrates made evil by love
(Chorus)
Trapped inside a frame not of my design
Simple follow (?) remember the lines
I had no choice, this is how it was cast
This is how it was cast, I had no choice
Trapped inside a frame, not of my design
Follow what is destined and tow the line
There is no escape, that's why they call it fate
There is no escape, that's why they call it fate
There is no escape, that's why they call it fate
There is no escape, that's why they call it fate
There is no escapeEmbed
