The Recursive Girl LyricsTo love and to lose has been my refrain
Just when I found hope I lose it again
Friends become lovers, then become friends
Players pass but the feelings stay the same
Hold the bitter taste in my mouth
Don't want forget, don't want to spit it out
The pain can only last for so long
Sweetness lingers after it's gone
Take it all on board as I go through life
Those loves are all that I know
Sum of everyone, I hold on
To the memories after the people are gone
(Chorus)
The start of somethin' new in the end
Get to try this love again
Like characters who switch their place
I'll wipe the tears my face
Your heart is made from the places you've been
Been through a lot and the state that I'm in
Endured loss and I've been fine
Hope that tomorrow the sun will still shine
(Chorus)
Watchin' the waves of life wash to shore
The pattern they take can't fool me no more
I want to feel it all because (?) change
I want to get wet before I come in from the rain
(Chorus)
Change of perspective not for one place
The memories mean too much to erase
The seasons turn to come back again
I still love him but I want it that way
Start of something new in the end
Get to try this love again
Like the characters switched their place
I'll wipe the tears my face
Remember our love like yesterday
Score my heart like the charts from a play
Don't let go, don't move away
As I grow and I know that it's okay
It's okayEmbed
