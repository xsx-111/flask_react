I Was There LyricsSalt for a stone, skin from the bone
A fission, division from merged to alone
Composure to dust turns sterling to rust
The marriage of fire and frozen combusts
I was there when a bomb went off in his heart
That sudden release that ripped him apart
It scarred and imploded the space in his soul
His dreams are craters, his life the (?)
Mortals are mortar and life is the fuse
Burnt memories and shrapnel diffuse
Melting to blood, the blue flames above
Paint sulphurous shadow elegies to love
Copper from gold, the banding unfolds
The halo of hope goes from tender to cold
(?) explodes, the pressure grows
When passion explodes we burn in the glow
Same scars when part of me died
But I lived and came out the other side
The sorrow is worth the redemption you'll feel
Life spins like a wheel when you start to heal
I saw the mind of my first love destroyed
The detonation pulled him into the void
I watched from the side as the madness evolved
Like you I'm a witness but can't get involved
Tattooed to my mind, frozen in time
A bomb in his hand, glass turning to sand
One union dissolves, another is made
Powder to spark to brilliance to dark
The paper corrupts the pavement erupts
Screams from the streets shatter the peace
Silence from sound, then confusion to calm
A fire dawned and then she was gone
Remember the girl
