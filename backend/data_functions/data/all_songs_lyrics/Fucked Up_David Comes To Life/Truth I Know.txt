Truth I Know LyricsI won't say I'm guilty
But the truth has changed
But trust me my friend
It'll end better this way
I couldn't watch quietly
And I won't pretend
To understand
I don't feign piety
But why would a God ever want to be
I could feign stories
Of regret and woe
But morals implore me
To share the truth that I know
(Chorus)
Stressful days
Yeah, restless nights
But I know I'm just
I bear the burden of right
And it's worse for the liar
Than the one deceived
Don't offer me solace
'Cause I don't believe
(Chorus)
The dimmest bulb in that factory
Tore her away
And our hearts still bleed
(Chorus)
And what of the fate of Veronica dear
He manipulates ya' with crocodile tears
And I can't pretend that it's alright
That the human darkness snuffed out her light
So fathers, don't cast your blame
In my place you'd do the same
And mother, do what thou wilt
It erodes us like the silt
Their sons destroy our world
By stealin' your little girls
The daughter you loved from birth
Slumbers beneath the earth
So ask yourself, what is one life worth
When measured against the children's birth?
Yet he's free to live and carry on
And she had to die and it's all so wrong
I will have order in this court room
I will have order in this court
I will have
I will have
Order
Order
Order
Order
The ones who make history
And the ones who repeat
All wind up the same yet under our feet
But what remains is what's passed down
My legacy and I am proudEmbed
