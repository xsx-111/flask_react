One More Night LyricsI've spent too much of my life defending my past
Can't find power in truth when it never lasts
Never said I was a hero, just I been miscast
Throughout all of the stress of being accused
My defenses replaced the love that we knew
I never got the chance just to miss you
I'd go through it again, I would embrace the pain
If it gave me the chance for just one glance
Of you in my arms to hold in my dreams
It's too hard to ever let you go
I may be alone now but I'll always know
You'll never be gone just as long as I keep
What memories we made when we were in love
I'd give into the lie to keep your memory alive
I know tryin' to forget you's my only crime
I never want to be right I just want to say goodbye
So take my sight, the wind in my hair
Take my touch, I know she's still there
In songs of birds just as long as they're words
I remember her taste, the sun on my face
So strip me away, I don't want to be real
I want to float through this peace that I feel
The memories stay like a seed in the rain
I'll nurture our love and live through it again
She's alive in my head so I'll live there instead
And remember our love
(Do all words can do, David I still love you
I want you to grow but never let me go
I'll be a seed in your heart
I'll be with you when you start
To turn and hum again
I'll be a part of your love
Your life will sprout like a tree
And all the leaves will be me
And all the fruit will glow just to let you know
That I loved you the best, now I can rest)
I felt your hair on my chest as your heart came to rest
It's tempo tied to the spin of the world I lived in
Maybe I won't say goodbye, pretend you never died
But I couldn't live in a world I didn't forgive
You know if I could, I'd carve myself out of wood
Paint over my scars and wish upon a star
I watched that sun as it drowned and rise again from the ground
In its perennial grace I see your shining face
Now that you've gone away, I can finally say
That if you were here today I'd love you the same way
It all happened before and it'll happen again
When you realize the end is the same place you began
I rest my case on my heart, I'm sick of playing the part
I don't want to be right, just one more night
I don't want to be right, just one more night
I don't want to be right, just one more night
I don't want to be right, just one more night
I don't want to be right, just one more night
I don't want to be right, just one more nightEmbed
