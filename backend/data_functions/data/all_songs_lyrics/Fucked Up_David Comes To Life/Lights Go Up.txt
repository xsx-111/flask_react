Lights Go Up LyricsI am old but I want to do it again
But like the end of a book when there's no pages left
You can only look back at the time that you spent
Not the life that you wanted but the life that you led
I've seen it all but I don't know what's next
Ours wasn't a love for an audience
The pictures we take don't resolve, they only reflect
Feelin' like I've been here before
Stood on this stage, walked through the door
There are still so many things that I'll never know
After the lights go up and the curtains close
I've seen it all but I don't know what's next
Ours wasn't a love for an audience
The pictures we take don't resolve, they only reflect
I'm still in love with you, after all this time
The best days of my life were when you were mine
Let them be the branches that I used to climb through my life
Sometimes life is so empty, sometimes life is so cold
I wanted to grow with you but I put it on hold
But I'll see you again when the story gets retold
And I've been here before, I've been here before
And I've been here before, I've been here before
Cast a seed to the sky as my valediction
That you could be the vine to grow the truth from the fiction
Empty the theater, rush the door
Start livin' the life you never could before
It's morning again at the factory
Someone will meet me there, rip me out of my dream
Warm my blood before I say goodbye
A new sun in the sky and love will never dieEmbed
