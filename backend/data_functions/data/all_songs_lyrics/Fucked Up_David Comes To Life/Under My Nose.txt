Under My Nose LyricsA wind has changed and now it's wrought
All the sweetest smells he had forgot
Not the faintest stench of the old days
It's all just gonna drift away
Damn those skeptics, harbingers of doom
Negative epidemic, followers of Hume
He understands all her needs
And for that she loves eternally
(?) so natural
We're experiencing something actual
My sun is shinin', how about yours?
It's kind of blindin', burn my eyes pure
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
Now he looks forward to wakin' up
She's unstuck him from his rut
Couldn't wait to go to sleep
And let all problems make their retreat
Used to wake up screamin', stolen from our dreams
Now I wake up beamin', the world it just gleams
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
With a sense of impending doom
That it's all gonna end too soon
I'm too good to be true
Where the fuck is the other shoe?
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it
It's all been worth it1Embed
