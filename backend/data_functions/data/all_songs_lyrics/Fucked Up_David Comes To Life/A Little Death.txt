A Little Death LyricsLike the leaves that fall off a tree
I know that love has left me
And I can give in to being estranged
As the branches wilt and the colors change
And the fish that wash up on shore
Who won't be swim in the sea anymore
Are like those thousands of wasted days
Upon the million grains of sand
And like the leaves that pile to decay
These little deaths happen every day
Maybe our love was just a clich√©
And not unique because it happened to me
Let my life blow away in the wind
Carry my old dreams far from me
I'll just sit alone and pass the time
I'm better off, it was too much
A little death from every touch
I had to run, I had to leave
I'm dead inside but I can breathe
I see now that it was me
I've lost my love and my family
But let the trees and the sea feel contrite
Convince myself that I'm alright
Better to smile and take the blame
Than to hold on to the truth and pain
I don't want love if it will hurt me again
(Chorus x2)
I'm better off, it was too much
A little death from every touch
I had to run, I had to leave
I'm dead inside but I can breathe
(x3)
Leaves they fall then come back
Their colors fade, turn to black
(?) just to love
Just give up and let the memory fadeEmbed
