Running On Nothing Lyrics
How could we be so blind to the effects each time?
Why keep watching when you know the end?
Why make this journey again and again?
We know it's just pain and lies
Let's watch, feign surprise
Afraid to admit that it's all a facade
You wind up alone in spite of what they laud

Well I been marchin', so long
I towed that line, so strong
I kept holdin' until it tore me apart
Until I (?) in my chest and ripped out my heart
So mother, may I please submit
The notion I no longer believe in this shit?
Lay me on the consummation bed
A fatal blow driven to the maidenhead

We're runnin on nothin'
But the fumes of our dreams
At another point in my life
That was good enough for me

Short plume, fades fast
The petals fall and crash
Well, I believe one could put it best
We spend most of life dealin' with the mess
The saddest joy is (?) I concede
But the bitter resolution is why I secede
Sick of fallin' from the lowest low
The higher the height, the further you go
Pull myself back to bended knee
Just an emotion, it hurts physically
Swans mate for life or so I've heard
Which is fitting, because that shit's for the birds

We're runnin on nothin'
But the fumes of our dreams
At another point in my life
That was good enough for me

They leave, it hurts
See it comin', it's worse
Stiff upper lip try to carry on
Let's pretend this shit is makin' us strong
And we only can take so much
Before all our sense of decency is finally crushed
And all that's left is a dried out husk
With the belief that love isn't gonna save us

We're runnin on nothin'
But the fumes of our dreams
At another point in my life
That was good enough for me
Those better days ain't gonna come
Those better days have passed us by
Those better days have all run out
'Cause those better days were a lie
Fall
Fall
Fall
FallEmbed
