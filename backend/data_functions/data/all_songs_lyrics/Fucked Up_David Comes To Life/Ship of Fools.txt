Ship of Fools LyricsIn the guts of a ship in the middle of the sea
Stands a ring for the rivals for everyone to see
They spar around the center of their own duality
The audience is full and pressed against the ropes
Chanting for blood of the loser of the bout
The fighters and their fears it symbolizes hope
They want to escape but there is no way out
Speaker and the spoke, the axle and the wheel
The teller and the tale, the flower and the bee
The sword and the steel, the beast and the yoke
The fish and the sea, the prisoner and the jail
Like God asking Abraham to kill his only son
He cries out for help, he stares at the sun
He never gets an answer when the day finally comes
When David fought Goliath he wasn't bound to lines
Now he'll never hit his mark, his opponent makes the rules
He's a servant of the story and the gallery confines
Driftin' on a sea of words, trapped on a ship of fools
Speaker and the spoke, the axle and the wheel
The teller and the tale, the flower and the bee
The sword and the steel, the beast and the yoke
The fish and the sea, the prisoner and the jail
Sinkin' on the ship of fools
Sinkin' on the ship of fools
Sinkin' on the ship of fools
Sinkin' on the ship of fools
You clamor for an outcome, a candid d√©nouement
The hunger for a resolution manifests the end
Concludes with ovation of the blood of your hands
He knows he couldn't help her when she needed him the most
What he gave her won't undo the one thing that he took
Like a vine around a flower, love in a fatal dose
His story won't endure, losers never write the books
The speaker and the spoke, the axle and the wheel
The teller and the tale, the flower and the bee
The sword and the steel, the beast and the yoke
The fish and the sea, the prisoner and the jail
The fire and the smoke, the starved and the meal
The head and the tail, the nut from the tree
The wax and the seal, the dagger and the cloak
The loss and the grief, the hammer and the nailEmbed
