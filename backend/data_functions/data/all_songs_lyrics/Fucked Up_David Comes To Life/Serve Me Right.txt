Serve Me Right LyricsI knew it wouldn't last
It all happened so fast
One minute they were so in love
The next one she had passed
I always had my doubts
I figured it all out
I knew something was curious
When he would talk about
How love wasn't a race
The guilt writ on his face
Right there in black and white
I think it serves him right
I told you it was him
I tell it like it is
The story served it's purpose
Now look what he did
I just read the lines
The acts were his designs
I don't tell him what to do
I just tell it back to you
And I'll tell you this
He killed her with his kiss
I think it serves him right
I think it serves him right
Maybe it was my fault
And I deserve to be upset
Maybe the price of being wrong
Is a lifetime of regret
So please tear up my memories
Into a thousand little parts
Give them to somebody else
Who won't tear up my heart
(x2)
The words are adding up
The overflowing cup
The leads and the details
Are enough to tip the scale
Take his life for a refrain
Make the verses his domain
Put inside of a frame
Have him tell the tale again
Paper he will serve
The correction he deserves
A lifetime to recite
I think it serves him right
Everyone's agreed
That David did mislead
As he concealed from everyone
His crimes and misdeeds
More power in the sentence
Than power of the word
His time into the tenses
His actions into verbs
It serves him right
(Repeat 3rd verse x2)
Box up the hopes I had to change
I don't want them around
Strike a nail into the coffin
Put it in the ground
If a confession's what you want
Then, I'm happy to oblige
Sing it from the mountaintops
I know truth's a lie
Throw me to the lions
Give 'em a bitter meal
An eternity of hurt
Couldn't compare to how I feel
Or lock me up forever
I won't put up a fight
I tried to steal a little love from life
And I know it serves me rightEmbed
