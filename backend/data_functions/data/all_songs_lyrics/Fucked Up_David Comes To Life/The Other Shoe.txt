The Other Shoe Lyrics
We're dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside

Right on time here's the other shoe
Clouds overhead start to loom
Some born to win others fate to lose
From the options we must choose
My friend dread is right on time
Can't start to think that it is fine
Watch the tower as it starts to teeter
New lyrics follow the same old meter

It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to fall

We're dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside

Butterflies, my stomach starts to heave
What joyous blunder waits for me
Finished first but I missed the start
Hitched the mule behind the cart
Take the rose by the thorns
Hope for sun, but here's the storm
So head outside and wait for rain
Watch it all go down the drain
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to fall

We're dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside

We settle in but it's time to go
Taken to sea by the undertow
Love the smell but I hate the taste
Feeling good is such a waste
Loved the book but I hate the end
Gained a lover but I lost a friend
Straight to worst, from the best
Nothin' fills that hole in my chest

It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to fall

To make things worse, it all goes so fast
And we try to hold on as they go past
We need a Peter, we get a Paul
At least Judas had the balls
To make a move on these building doubts
About how this messiah would shake out
I feel the nail against my skin
Wait for the hammer to drive it in
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to fall

We're dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside

It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to...
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to...
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to fall
Sh'mon

We're dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside

It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to...
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to fall

Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the inside
Dyin' on the insideEmbed
