Remember My Name LyricsNo truer plea has ever been
Than what, through David, we've seen
His turn from a life of frustration
To embrace love's condemnation
Better to let love lie
Than have to see it die
It's better to be alone
Than feel your heart turn to stone
The flower grows just for the seed
The (?) bloom the honey bee
Shouldn't a free man's soul rise
Above these ravenous designs of love?
Better to be born blind
Than to see and then lose sight
Better a desolate peace
Than to fight with your memories
So take my heart to your grave
It just pumps cold blood through my veins
I lost it all in fate's game
Only the devil remembers my name
Only a foolish heart concedes to fate
And the trials and turns that it dictates
The only love that will never die
Is the love you always deny
Like a barb it clings
Loss forever stings
The pain will never leave
Love is a cruel disease
Like a wick that holds to the flame
The path to her started the blaze
The match you made is to blame
The steps to love and death were the same
Now that you've loved and lost
Would you repay the cost? A price so severe
If you'd never loved her she'd be here
So take my heart to your grave
It just pumps cold blood through my veins
I lost it all in fate's game
Only the devil remembers my name
