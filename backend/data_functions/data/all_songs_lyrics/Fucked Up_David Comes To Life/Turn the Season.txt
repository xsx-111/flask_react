Turn the Season Lyrics
Things go up and then they go down
Chase a smile with a frown
He knows that his joy will stop
Waiting for the other shoe to drop
He's a ship on the sea
Setting sail to perfidy
He is cold, he is warm
He's the peace inside the storm

Feel the swelling of a wave
Hear the ringin' of a bell
He's been weak and he's been brave
He's been to heaven and he's been to hell

See the old in the new
See the life stretched before you
See a mother in the child
There was youth behind grey eyes
I don't know him anymore
He isn't like he was before
The stone is taken by the tide
Another season on the other side
Like the spinning of a wheel
He'll be hurt but he will heal
There's a flower in the weeds
There's a life inside the seed

And he said
"Never been as happy as I am today"
But then the seasons turned and the darkness came
So when it all falls apart
I'll have a piece of my heart
Try to think of the healing that comes out of pain
Try to redeem myself for mistakes in advance
The sun will shine after the rain
Well, I will all fall down
I'll get another chance
Just wipe away the tears and try again

We couldn't see without dark
Thing's wouldn't end without a spark
There is no truth without lies
And no future without memories
He's in the middle of the road
From where he's been and where he'll go
He's the forest kissed by flames
The trees die so they can grow again
He knows that death is part of life
He would've made that girl his wife
Now there's only darkness
There is no dawn, now that she's gone

And he said
"Never been as happy as I am today"
But then the seasons turned and the darkness came
So when it all falls apart
I'll have a piece of my heart
Try to think of the healing that comes out of pain
Try to redeem myself for mistakes in advance
The sun will shine after the rain
Well, I will all fall down
I'll get another chance
Just wipe away the tears and try againEmbed
