All Cats Are Grey Lyrics
I never thought that I would find myself
In bed amongst the stones
The columns are all men begging to crush me
No shapes sail on the dark deep lakes
And no flags wave me home

In the caves, all cats are grey
In the caves, the texture coats my skin
In the death cell, a single note rings on and on and on2Embed
