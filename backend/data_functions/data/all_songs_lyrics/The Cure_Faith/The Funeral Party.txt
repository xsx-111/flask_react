The Funeral Party Lyrics
Two pale figures ache in silence
Timeless in the quiet ground
Side by side in age and sadness

I watched and acted wordlessly
As piece by piece, you performed your story
Moving through an unknown past
Dancing at the funeral party

Memories of children's dreams
Lie lifeless, fading lifeless
Hand in hand with fear and shadows
Crying at the funeral party

I heard a song and turned away
As piece by piece, you performed your story
Noiselessly across the floor
Dancing at the funeral party4Embed
