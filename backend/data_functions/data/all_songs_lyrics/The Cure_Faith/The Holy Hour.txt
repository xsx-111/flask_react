The Holy Hour Lyrics
I kneel and wait in silence
As one by one the people slip away into the night
The quiet and empty bodies kiss the ground before they pray
Kiss the ground and slip away

I sit and listen dreamlessly
A promise of salvation makes me stay then look at your face
And feel my heart pushed in as all around the children play
The games they tired of yesterday
They play, they play

I stand and hear my voice cry out
A wordless scream at ancient power
It breaks against stone
I softly leave you crying
I cannot hold what you devour
The sacrifice of penance in the holy hour4Embed
