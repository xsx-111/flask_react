Primary Lyrics
The innocence of sleeping children
Dressed in white and slowly dreaming
Stops all time
I slow my steps and start to blur
So many years have filled my heart
I never thought I'd say those words

The further we go and older we grow
The more we know the less we show
The further we go and older we grow
The more we know the less we show

The very first time I saw your face
I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune
The very first time I touched your skin
I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon

Oh, remember
Oh, please don't change

So the fall came, thirteen years
A shiny ring and how I could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat
Another perfect lie is choked
But it always feels the same
So they close together
Dressed in red and yellow
Innocent forever
Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms still dream

The further we go and older we grow
The more we know the less we show
The further we go and older we grow
The more we know the less we show5Embed
