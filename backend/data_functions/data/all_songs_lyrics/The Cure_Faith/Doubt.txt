Doubt Lyrics
Stop my flight to fight and die
And take a stand to change my life
So savage with red desperation
I clench my hands, you draw your claws
A hidden rage consumes my heart
Fueled by years of wasted time
I close my eyes and tense myself
And screaming throw myself in fury
Over the edge and into your blood

Tear at flesh and rip at skin
And smash at doubt, I have to break you
Fury drives my vicious blows
I see you fall but still I strike you

Again and again, your body falls
The movement is sharp and clear and pure and gone
I stop and kneel beside you
Drained of everything but pain

Screaming throw myself in fury
Over the edge and into your blood
Into your blood
Kiss you once and see you writhe
Hold you close and hear you cry
Kiss your eyes and finish your life
Kiss your eyes
Finish your life

Again and again, your body falls
The movement is sharp and clear and pure and gone
I stop and kneel beside you
Knowing I'll murder you again tonight

(Sharp and clear and pure)
(Sharp and clear and pure)
Knowing I'll murder you again
Knowing I'll murder you again
Knowing I'll murder you again
Knowing I'll murder you again tonight1Embed
