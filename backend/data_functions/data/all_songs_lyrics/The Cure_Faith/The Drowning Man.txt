The Drowning Man Lyrics
She stands twelve feet above the flood
She stares, alone across the water
The loneliness grows and slowly
Fills her frozen body, sliding downwards
One by one her senses die
The memories fade and leave her eyes
Still seeing worlds that never were
And one by one, the bright birds leave her

Starting at the violent sound
She tries to turn, but final, noiseless
Slips and strikes her soft dark head
The water bows, receives her
And drowns her at its ease
And drowns her at its ease

I would have left the world all bleeding
Could I only help you love?
The fleeting shapes, so many years ago
So young and beautiful and brave
Everything was true
It couldn't be a story
I wish it was all true
I wish it couldn't be a story
The words all left me lifeless
Hoping, breathing like the drowning man
Oh, Fuchsia
You leave me breathing like the drowning man
Dreaming like the drowning man
Breathing like the drowning man
(Breathing like the drowning man)
(Dreaming like the drowning man)4Embed
