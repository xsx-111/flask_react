Faith Lyrics

Catch me if I fall, I'm losing hold
I can't just carry on this way
And every time I turn away
I lose another blind game
The idea of perfection holds me
Suddenly, I see you change
Everything at once the same
But the mountain never moves
Rape me like a child, christened in blood
Painted like an unknown saint
There's nothing left but hope
Your voice is dead and old and oh, always empty
Trust in me through closing years
Perfect moments wait
If only we could stay
Please say the right words
We cry like the stone white clown
And stand, lost forever in a happy crowd

No one lifts their hands
No one lifts their eyes
Justified with empty words
The party just gets better and better
I went away alone
With nothing left but faith
I went away alone
With nothing left but faith

With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith, with nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith, with nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith7Embed
