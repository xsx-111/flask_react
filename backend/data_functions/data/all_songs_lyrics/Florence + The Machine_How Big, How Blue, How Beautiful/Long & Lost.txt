Long & Lost Lyrics
Lost in the fog, these hollow hills
Blood running hot, night chills
Without your love, I'll be
So long and lost, are you missing me?

Is it too late to come on home?
Are all those bridges now old stone?
Is it too late to come on home?
Can the city forgive? I hear its sad song

I need the clouds to cover me
Pulling them down, surround me
Without your love I'll be
So long and lost, are you missing me?

Is it too late to come on home?
Are all those bridges now old stone?
Is it too late to come on home?
Can the city forgive? I hear its sad song

It's been so long between the words we spoke
Will you be there up on the shore, I hope
You wonder why it is that I came home
I figured out where I belong
But it's too late to come on home
Are all those bridges now old stone?
But it's too late to come on home
Can the city forgive? I hear its sad song18Embed
