How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful Lyrics
Between a crucifix and the Hollywood sign, we decided to get hurt
Now thereâ€™s a few things we have to burn
Set our hearts ablaze, and every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And I was making you a wish
In every skyline

How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful

And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And every day I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
A satellite beside me
And meanwhile a man was falling from space
As he hit the earth I left this place
Let the atmosphere surround me
A satellite beside me

What are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now it's all coming through
Tell me you see it too
We've opened our eyes and it's changing the view
Oh, what are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now it's all coming through
How big, how blue, how (beautiful)
How big, how blue, how (beautiful)

And every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And I was making you a wish
In every skyline
And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And every day I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
I'm happy you're beside me

What are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now it's all coming through
Tell me you see it too
We've opened our eyes and it's changing the view
Oh, what are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now it's all coming through

How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how...
So much time on the other side
Waiting for you to wake up
So much time on the other side
Waiting for you to wake up
Maybe I'll see you in another life
If this one wasn't enough
So much time on the other side

How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how...51Embed
