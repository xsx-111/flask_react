Ship to Wreck Lyrics
Don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head
Dredging up great white sharks, swimming in the bed
Here comes a killer whale, to sing me to sleep
Thrashing the covers off, has me by its teeth

And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

What's with the long face? Do you want more?
Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door
And don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before
The chair is an island, darling, you can't touch the floor

And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

And good God
Under starless skies we are lost
And into the breach we got tossed
And the water's coming in fast

And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?40Embed
