What Kind of Man Lyrics
I was on a heavy tip
Trying to cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side, like always
Wondering what to do with life

I'd already had a sip
So I reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side, like always
You could never make your mind

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh, my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
You're a holy fool, all coloured blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage?
To have me crawling back for more

And with one kiss
(And with one kiss)
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
(For twenty years)
What kind of man loves like this?

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

But I can't beat ya, 'cause I'm still with ya
"Oh mercy", I implore
"Oh mercy", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
(Back, back, back against the wall)
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
(Back, back, back against the wall)

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
