Third Eye Lyrics
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline

Hey, look up
Don't make a shadow of yourself
Always shutting out the light
Caught in your own creation
Look up, look up
It tore you open
And oh, how much?

'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why

That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline

Hey, look up
You don't have to be a ghost
Here amongst the living
You are flesh and blood
And you deserve to be loved
And you deserve what you are given
And oh, how much?
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why

That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline
Original lifeline

'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why

That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline
That original lifeline

'Cause your pain is a tribute
The only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle
Always there to remind you
But your pain is a tribute
The only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle
Always there to remind you
I'm the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change

'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why

I'm the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
Original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
Original lifeline
I'm the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
Original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline26Embed
