The Night Before Lyrics
We said our goodbyes (Ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)
Now, today, I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Were you telling lies? (Ah, the night before?)
Was I so unwise? (Ah, the night before?)
When I held you near, you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did, it makes me wanna cry

We said our goodbye (Ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)
Now, today, I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
(Yes)


When I held you near, you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did, it makes me wanna cry

Were you telling lies? (Ah, the night before)
Was I so unwise? (Ah, the night before)
When I held you near, you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before6Embed
