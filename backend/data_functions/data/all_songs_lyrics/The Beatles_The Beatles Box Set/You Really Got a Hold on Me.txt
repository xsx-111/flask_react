You Really Got a Hold on Me Lyrics
I don't like you, but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly, I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me), baby!

I don't want you, but I need you
Don't want to kiss you, but I need to
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now, my love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me), baby!

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me...
Tighter!
Tighter!

I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh, oh, oh
I want to split now, I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me), baby! (baby!)
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me (Please), hold me (Squeeze), hold me, hold me...

You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me)Embed
