Revolution 1 Lyrics
Take two
Okay

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out, in

Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right7Embed
