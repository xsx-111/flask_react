Hands of Love Lyrics
On a crowded street, or from a passing car
I can see the world from where I am
People stand in line so they can buy their things
They buy a vegetable or a can

I taste the water and the water tastes hot
I taste the water and the water tastes hot

Hands of love, they keep on slipping
Hands of love, they keep on gripping

My home, it might as well just be a cave
And the ones next door don't talk to me
And when I'm lyin' in bed at night, I hear the sounds
Of the sirens, and the dogs, and the people screaming

I taste the water and the water tastes hot
I taste the water and the water tastes hot

Hands of love, they keep on slipping
Hands of love, they keep on gripping
Hands of love, they keep on slipping
I taste the water and the water tastes hot
I taste the water and the water tastes hot

Whistle down the... whistle down the road
(Hands of love, they keep on slipping)
Whistle down the... whistle down the road
(Hands of love, they keep on gripping)
Whistle down the... whistle down the road
(Hands of love, they keep on slipping)
Hands of love, hands of love
Hands of love, hands of love
Hands of love, hands of love
Hands of love, hands of love
Hands of love, hands of loveEmbed
