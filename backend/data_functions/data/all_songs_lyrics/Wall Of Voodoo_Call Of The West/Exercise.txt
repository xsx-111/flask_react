Exercise Lyrics
Check, check
Okay

I exercise in a most unusual way
I watch some TV almost every day
Out of my bed and onto the floor
I watch it some and then I watch it some more

I exercise in a most unusual way
I exercise in a most unusual way

Reading books and sometimes modeling clay
Hop in my car and head outta town
I'm driving straight but I'm just driving around
I exercise in a most unusual way

I exercise in a most unusual way
I read my calender and you can hear me say
My memory's keen, it's all in my head
Should write things down but I forget them instead
I exercise in a most unusual way
I exercise in a most unusual way
I exercise in a most unusual wayEmbed
