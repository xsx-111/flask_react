Look at Their Way Lyrics
Look at the way they're walking
All these people around are givin' me looks
Keep a big secret on the quiet side
Where's the nearest place to hide?
Look at their way

Been around long enough now
And they'll be around after everyone's gone
A mother makes love to her only son
Turn on the lights and watch them run

Look at their way
Look at their way
Look at their way on the floor today

All together now they'll rub their long legs
And play a sad melody, the only one they know
To air and earth and the quiet side
And the mind built a million years ago

Look at their way
Look at their way
Look at their way on the calendar
Look at their way
Look at their way
Look at their way on the floor todayEmbed
