Spy World Lyrics
Hello, hello, this is Monkeywrench, come in
Calling Money Hutch headquarters
Tell Smoky Grayhead the bus stopper is a guy
Tell Mister Negative to check on the 
And I thought this was a glamorous job

Well, there's that man who's got everything that he needs
And when the world is falling in he'll never bleed
He goes by Jones in Istanbul and Smith in Peru
His job's never through

It's time to start this little game of cat and mouse
And try to keep one step ahead there's strangers in the house
His watch is really a radio, his gun a pen
He knows that it's all gone, no mom, nobody wins

Spy world, spy world
Spy world, spy world
Spy world, spy world
Spy world, spy world
Spy world, spy world
Spy world, spy word
Spy world, spy world
Spy world, spy world
Shaken, not stirred, okay?
I'm really tired of wearing these sunglassesEmbed
