In a Lonely Place LyricsCaressing the marble and stone
Love that was special for one
Waste in the fever and heat
How I wish you were here with me now
Body that curls in and hides
Hardships that often belie
Warm like a dog round your feet
How I wish you were here with me now
Hangman looks round as he waits
Cord stretches tight then it breaks
Someday we will die in your dreams
How I wish you were here with you now1Embed
