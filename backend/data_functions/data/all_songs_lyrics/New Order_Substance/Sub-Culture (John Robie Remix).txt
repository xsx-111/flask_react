Sub-Culture (John Robie Remix) Lyrics
(One of these days)
(One of these days)

I like walking in the park
When it gets late at night
I move round in the dark (the dark)
And leave when it gets light
I sit around by day
Tied up in chains so tight (tight!)
These crazy words of mine
So wrong they could be

What do I get out of this?
(One of these days!)
I always try, I always miss
(Woah!)
One of these days you'll go back to your home
(One of these days!)
You won't even notice that you are alone
One of thesе days when you sit by yourself
(One of thеse days!)
You'll realise you can't shaft without someone else
In the end you will submit
(One of these days!)
It's got to hurt a little bit
I like talking in my sleep
When people work so hard
They need what they can't keep
A choice that leaves them scarred
A room without a view (tight!)
Unveils the truth so soon (tight!)
And when the sun goes down (One of these days!)
You've lost what you have found

What do I get out of this?
(One of these days!)
I always try, I always miss
(Woah!)
One of these days you'll go back to your home
(One of these days!)
You won't even notice that you are alone
One of these days when you sit by yourself
(One of these days!)
You'll realise you can't shaft without someone else
In the end you will submit
(One of these days!)
It's got to hurt a little bit

(One of these days!)
(One of these days!)
(One of these days!)
(Days! Days!)
(One of these days!)
(--this? I always try--)
(One of these days you'll go back to your home)
(One of these days!)
(You won't even notice that you are alone)
One of these days when you sit by yourself
(One of these days!)
You'll realise you can't shaft without someone else
In the end you will
In the end you will
In the end you will submit
(One of these days!)
It's got to hurt a
It's got to hurt a
It's got to hurt a little bit
--bit
--bit
(One of these days!)
(--this? I always try--)
(One of these days you'll go back to your home)
(One of these days!)
(You won't even notice that you are alone)
(One of these days when you sit by yourself)
(One of these days!)
(--shaft without someone else)
In the end you will submit
(One of these days!)
It's got to hurt a little bitEmbed
