Mesh LyricsHope and desire
The antique sea
Hopes and fears are
All we ever see
We made a contract
In a field of snow
A single release now
And he's saying
Out of the woods and trees
Across the rain
From out of the nighttime
Somebody screams
He's on his way somewhere
All like he's been nowhere
I don't know
Nobody knows
Small girl is lost here
On a frozen floor
What do they want with me?
What do they want with me?
I don't know
Nobody knows
Nobody even tries
To find out what they want to knowEmbed
