Kiss of Death Lyrics"Let's go out and have some fun"
I know, you know, you believe in a land of love
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love
Tonight...
...pleasure zone
...tend...
"...have some fun"
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love
I know, you know, we believe in a land of loveEmbed
