True Dub LyricsI feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun
Morn-morn-morn-morn-morn-morning sun
Morn-morn-morn-morn-morn-morning sun
Morn-morn-morn-morn-morn-morning sun
Morn-morn-morn-morn-morning sun
Morn-morn-morn-morn-morn-morn-morning sun
Morn-morn-morn-morn-morn-morning sun
Morn-morn-morn-morn-morning sun
Morning-morning-morning-morning
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morn-morn-morn-morn-mo-morn-morning sun
Morning sun
Morn-morn-morning sunEmbed
