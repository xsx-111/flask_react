With No Shoes LyricsStone me
And may you always have no shoes
And I would rather just for you
Be the devil make you mine
And she
I know you say you hardly sleep
I make you cold I make you weak
I'll be the son of everything you hate
And come the day I'll be the king
The king of all and everything
Your saint is coming thru'
You know he's going to lead on you
I've been walkin' with no shoes
Keep your mountain picnic blues
Today I'm baptising you
Stone me
And may you always have no shoes
And I would rather just for you
Be in a taxi driving miles from here
I've been walking with no shoes
Fill my kidneys up with booze
Today I'm killing you
Killing you
The stars who play with laughing say goodnight
I know God is on your side
I'll be the devil, make you, make you mine
And I could always wait to shoot you down
I keep you underneath my crown
A side of beef will see you off to sleep
I've been walking with no shoes
Keep your mountain picnic blues
Today I'm baptising you
Baptising youEmbed
