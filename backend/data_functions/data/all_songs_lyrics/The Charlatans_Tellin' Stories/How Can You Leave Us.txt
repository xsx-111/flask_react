How Can You Leave Us LyricsDarlin' don't you cry
Whatever is yours is mine
All the pictures on your wall
I know you look up to them all
Usually love comes first
I watch as you twist and turn
I could give you mouth to mouth
And only the truth would come out
Here I come how can you follow
It's only a gut feelin'
I don't want to believe it
How can you leave us
How can you bleed on us
Darlin' you live to learn
Hanging on all our words
Promise me you'll be home soon
I could rush through the city to you
Won't find you in this world
Catchin' dinosaurs
No saint will save you this time round
I only wish you were here with us now
Here I come how can you follow
It's only a gut feelin'
I don't want to believe it
How can you leave us
How can you bleed on usEmbed
