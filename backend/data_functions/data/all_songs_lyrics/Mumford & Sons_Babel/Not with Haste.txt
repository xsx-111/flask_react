Not with Haste Lyrics
Your eyes they tie
Me down so hard
I'll never learn to put up a guard
So keep my love
My candle bright
Learn me hard, oh learn me right
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
Though I may speak
Some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength
From which to speak
When you sit me down, and see I'm weak

We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

So as we walked
Through fields of green
Was the fairest sun I'd ever seen
And I was broke
I was on my knees
But you said yes as I said please
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
I leave no ties
For a cynics mind
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste
As it keeps my heart and soul in it's place
And I will love with urgency but not with haste5Embed
