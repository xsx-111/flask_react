Shake Rattle and Roll Lyrics
Get out of that bed
Wash your face and hands
Get out of that bed
And wash your face and hands
Get into that kitchen
Make some noise with the pots and pans
And ah, you're wearing them dresses
The sun come shining through, yeah
Ah, you're wearing them dresses
The sun come shining through
I can't believe my eyes
All of that belongs to you
Now, I believe to my soul
You're the devil in nylon hose
Listen, I believe to my soul
You're the devil in nylon hose
Ah, you won't do right to save your natural soul

And all you wanna do is
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Every morning
(Shake, rattle and roll)
With the feeling
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Sing the line, kids
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Every morning
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Ah, you're doing it
(Shake, rattle and roll)
I'm like a one-eyed cat
Peeping in a seafood store â€” you don't hear me
I'm like a one-eyed cat
Peeping in a seafood store
I can look at you and tell you ain't no time no more

Everybody sing it
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Let me hear you
(Shake, rattle and roll)
A little louder
(Shake, rattle and roll)
With the feeling
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Got the feeling
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Good to me
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Everybody sing it
(Shake, rattle and roll)
A little louder
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Make me feel it
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Love to sing it
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Everybody
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Sing the song now
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Oh, one more time now
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Let me hear you do it
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Sing out your song now
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Oh, I like to do it
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Everybody sing it
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Everybody dancing
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Oh, oh yeah
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Don't you love it
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Make you feel good
(Shake, rattle and roll)
With the feeling
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Everybody singing
(Shake, rattle and roll)
Oh yeah
(Shake, rattle and roll)
One more time
(Shake, rattle and roll)
(Shake, rattle and roll)Embed
