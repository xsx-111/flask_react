I Lost Everything Lyrics
I lost everything
When I lost you
Now my heart is breaking in two
I found memories
What am I to do?
Those memories keep on making me blue

The moon and the stars
They don't seem the same
Love has lost its glory
To me it's just a game

No, I lost everything
My dreams are all through
My life is only make-believe without you, hmm

And oh, my, my, my, my life is only make-believe without youEmbed
