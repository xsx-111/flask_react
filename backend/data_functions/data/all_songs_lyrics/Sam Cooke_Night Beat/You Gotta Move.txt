You Gotta Move Lyrics
You gotta move, you gotta move
Oh, you gotta move; baby, you gotta move
If you keep on mistreating me, baby
You gotta move
I said you gotta move, you gotta move
Move on, oh, you gotta move
If you keep on dogging me, baby
You gotta move

My mother told me long time ago
Watch out for women, oh, they can hurt you so
And if you keep on hurting me like you're doing
You gotta move

I said you gotta move
You gotta move
Move on, oh, you gotta move
Now if you keep on dogging me around
You gotta move

Let me tell you
I love you, baby, to my heart
You keep on mistreating me, oh, we've got to part
I hate to let you go, baby
But oh, you gotta move
Let me tell you one more time
You gotta move, gotta move
Get away from me, baby, oh, you gotta move
Now if you keep on hurting my heart, girl
You gotta move
One more time, move on
You gotta move from me, baby
Oh, you gotta move
I hate to let you go, baby
But oh, you gotta moveEmbed
