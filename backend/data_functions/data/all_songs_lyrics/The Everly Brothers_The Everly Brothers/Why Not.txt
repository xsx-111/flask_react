Why Not LyricsWhy not?
Why not?
Why not let me love you darling?
Why not let me love you dear?
I come to you with open arms dear
But you won't let my arms near you
You put me down and how you shun me
Why do you do this to me honey?
Why not?
Why not?
Why not let me love you darling?
Why not let me love you dear?
One thing for certain ain't no maybe
This stalling bit is hurtin' baby
Have you changed so that you now hate me
Is that the reason you wonâ€™t date me?
Why not?
Why not?
Why not let me love you darling?
Why not let me love you dear
Have I done something to offend you?
Have I done somethingEmbed
