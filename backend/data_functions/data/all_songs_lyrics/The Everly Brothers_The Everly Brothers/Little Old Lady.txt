Little Old Lady LyricsLittle old lady passing by
Catching everyone's eye
You have such a charming manner
Sweet and shy
Little old bonnet set in place
And a Smile on your face
You're a perfect picture in your
Lavender and lace
Little bit of business here
Little bit of business there
Bet that you've been window shopping
All around the square
Little old lady, time for tea
Here's a kiss, two or three
You're just like that little old lady
I hold dear to me
Little bit of business here
Little bit of business there
Bet that you've been window shopping
All around the square
Little old lady, time for tea
Here's a kiss, two or three
You're just like that little old lady
I hold dear to meEmbed
