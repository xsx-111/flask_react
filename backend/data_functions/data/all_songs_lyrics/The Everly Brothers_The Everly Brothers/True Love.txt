True Love LyricsI give to you
And you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on
It will always be
True love, true love
For you and I
Have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give to you
And to give to me love forever true
For you and I
Have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give to you
And to give to me love forever trueEmbed
