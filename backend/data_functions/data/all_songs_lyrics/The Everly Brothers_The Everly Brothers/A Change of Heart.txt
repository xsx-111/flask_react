A Change of Heart LyricsWell I guess you must have had a change of heart
You don’t treat me like you used to at the start
Your campaign of love was quite a work of art
But I guess you must have had a change of heart
Guess I took too much for granted anyway
But it's just cause I'd believe the things you’d say
Not so long ago you'd swore we’d never part
But I guess you must have had a change of heart
Well good-bye to all those castles in the air
And good-bye to all the dreams we used to share
They were fragments of a dream that fell apart
Now they’re gone because you've had a change of heartEmbed
