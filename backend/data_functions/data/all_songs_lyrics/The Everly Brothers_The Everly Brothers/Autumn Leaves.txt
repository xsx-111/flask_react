Autumn Leaves Lyrics
The falling leaves drift by my window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips the summer kisses
The sunburned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter songs
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter songs
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall
When autumn leaves start to fallEmbed
