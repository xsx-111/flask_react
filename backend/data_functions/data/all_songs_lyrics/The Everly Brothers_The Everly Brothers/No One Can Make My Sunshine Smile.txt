No One Can Make My Sunshine Smile LyricsShe goes out seven nights a week
But she's unhappy all the while
Each night a different guy
Does his very best to try
But
No one can make my sunshine smile
My sunshine used to smile for me
But then she traded me for style
Now she's got Romeos
Who buy her fancy clothes
But
No one can make my sunshine smile
Once her smile could light up a room
And make the sun look dim
Her laugh in her eyes had a way
Of making my day begin
But since she said goodbye to me
She hasn't smiled for quite a while
I was just her little clown
But since I'm not around, well
No one can make my sunshine smile
No one can make my sunshine smile
No one can make my sunshine smileEmbed
