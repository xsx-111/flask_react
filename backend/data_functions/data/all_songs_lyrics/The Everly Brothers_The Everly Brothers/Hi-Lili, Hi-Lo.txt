Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo LyricsA song of love is a sad song
Hi-lili, hi-lili, hi-lo
A song of love is a song of woe
Don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song
For I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain
Hi-lili, hi-lili, hi-lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again
Hi-lili, hi-lili, hi-loEmbed
