When I Grow Too Old to Dream LyricsAfter you've gone
Life will go on
Life has been beautiful
We have been young
After you've gone
Life will go on
Like an old song we have sung
When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So kiss me my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heartEmbed
