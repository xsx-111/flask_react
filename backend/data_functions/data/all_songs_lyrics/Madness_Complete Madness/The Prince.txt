The Prince LyricsBuster, he sold the heat
With a rock-steady beat
An earthquake is erupting
But not in Orange street
A ghost-dance is preparing
You got to help us with your feet
If you're not in the mood to dance
Step back, grab yourself a seat
This may not be uptown Jamaica
But we promise you a treat
Buster bowl me over with your bogus dance
Shuffle me off my feet
Even if I kept on runnin'
I'd never get to Orange street
So I set it up myself to say
For the man who set the beat
So I'll leave it up to you out there
To get him back on his feet
Buster bowl me over with your bogus dance
Shuffle me off my feet
Even if I kept on runnin'
I'll never get to Orange street
Bring back the
Who is the
We want the
Bring back the Prince...2Embed
