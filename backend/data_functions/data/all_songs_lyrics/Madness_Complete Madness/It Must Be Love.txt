It Must Be Love Lyrics
I never thought I'd miss you
Half as much as I do
And I never thought I'd feel this way
The way I feel about you

As soon as I wake up every night every day
I know that it's you I need
To take the blues away

It must be love, love, love
It must be love, love, love
Nothing more, nothing less
Love is the best

How can it be that we can
Say so much without words
Bless you and bless me
Bless the bees and the birds

I've got to be near you every night, every day
I couldn't be happy any other way
It must be love, love, love
It must be love, love, love
Nothing more, nothing less
Love is the best

As soon as I wake up every night every day
I know that it's you I need
To take the blues away

It must be love, love, love
It must be love, love, love
It must be love, love, love
It must be love, love, love
It must be love, love, love
It must be love...2Embed
