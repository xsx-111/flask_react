Grey Day LyricsWhen I get home it's late at night
I'm black and bloody from my life
I haven't time to clean my hands
Cuts will only sting me through my dreams
It's well past midnight as I lie
In a semi-conscious state
I dream of people fighting me
Without any reason I can see
In the morning I awake
My arms my legs my body aches
The sky outside is wet and grey
So begins another weary day
So begins another weary day
After eating I go out
People passing by me shout
I can't stand this agony
Why don't they talk to me?
In the park I have to rest
I lie down and I do my best
The rain is falling on my face
I wish I could sink without a trace
In the morning I awake
My arms my legs my body aches
The sky outside is wet and grey
So begins another weary day
So begins another weary day
In the park I have to rest
I lie down and I do my best
The rain is falling on my face
I wish I could sink without a trace
In the morning I awake
My arms my legs my body aches
The sky outside is wet and grey
So begins another weary day
So begins another weary dayEmbed
