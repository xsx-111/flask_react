Night Boat to Cairo Lyrics
(Night boat to Cairo)

It's just gone noon, half past monsoon
On the banks of the river Nile
Here comes the boat, only half-afloat
Oarsman grins a toothless smile
Only just one more to this desolate shore
Last boat along the river Nile
Doesn't seem to care, no more wind in his hair
As he reaches his last half mile
The oar snaps in his hand before he reaches dry land
But the sound doesn't deafen his smile
Just pokes at wet sand with an oar in his hand

Floats off down the river Nile
Floats off down the river Nile

All aboard
Night boat to Cairo
Night boat to Cairo
