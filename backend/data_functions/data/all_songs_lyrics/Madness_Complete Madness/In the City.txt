In the City Lyrics(City, city!)
(City!)
He is just a boy in the city
Dressed the same he's uniformly pretty
He knows it's the time
He can read the signs
He can really change in the city
The best dressed boy in town he thinks it's funny
Half a dozen jobs makes his money
He's just a boy in the city
Friday night propels Walter Mitty
It's about time
He can read the signs
A night on the town, in the city
Monday is a work day
Tuesday's much the same
Wednesday comes and goes away
Thursday's back again
Friday night to Sunday in the morning
Monday brings the weekend's final yawning
Now it's about time
He has crossed the line
He is miles away in the city
(City!)
(City!)
(City!)
(City!)
Now it's about time
He can read the signs
He can really change
It is on his mind
He has crossed the line
He has gone once more from the cityEmbed
