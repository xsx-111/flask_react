Cardiac Arrest LyricsPapers in the morning, bowler hat on head
Walking to the bus stop, he's longing for his bed
Waiting with his neighbours in the rush-hour queue
Got to get the first bus, so much for him to do
He's got to hurry got to get his seat
Can't miss his place, got to rest his feet
Ten more minutes till he gets there, the crossword's nearly done
It's getting so hard these days, not nearly so much fun
His mind wanders to the office, his telephone, desk and chair
He's been happy with the company, they've treated him real fair
Think of seven letters begin and end in 'C'
Like a big American car but misspelt with a 'D'
I wish this bus'd get a move on, driver's taking his time
I just don't know I'll be late, oh dear, what will the boss say?
Pull yourself together now
Don't get in a state
Don't you worry
There's no hurry
It's a lovely day
Could all be going your way
Take the doc's advice
Let up, enjoy your life
Listen to what they say
It's not a game they play
Never get there at this rate, he's caught up in a jam
There's a meeting this morning, it's just his luck, oh damn
His hand dives in his pocket for his handkerchief
Pearls of sweat on his bowler, his pulse-beat seems so brief
Eyes fall on his wrist-watch, the seconds pass real slow
Gasping for the hot air but the chest pain it won't go
Tried to ask for help but can't seem to speak a word
Words are whispered frantically but don't seem to be heard
What about the wife and kids?
They all depend on me
We're so sorry
We told you not to hurry
Now it's just too late
You've got a certain date
We thought we made it clear
We all voiced our inner fears
We left it up to you
There's nothing we can do
Don't you worry
There's no hurry
It's a lovely day
Could all be going your way
Take the doc's advice
Let up, enjoy your life
Listen to what they say
It's not a game they playEmbed
