Remember Me (When the Candlelights Are Gleaming) Lyrics
You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours 'til the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now and I will never
Be the same, except in memory

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
And it would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me

A brighter face may take my place when we're apart dear
Another love with a heart more bold and free
But in the end fair-weather friends may break your heart, dear
And if they do, sweetheart, remember me

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me
Just to know you still remember meEmbed
