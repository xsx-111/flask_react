Subterranean Homesick Blues Lyrics
Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off

God knows when but you're doing' it again!
You better duck down the alleyway looking for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten

Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's something' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep it all hid

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talking at the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early may
Orders from the D.A., the double D.A

Walk on your tip toes, don't try "no doz"
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, it's something' that you did
Look out, kid, cause they keep all hid, look out

Looks to me like you did
A little to much hitting' kid
You should've took it to the bridge
Before you started to skid

Look out, kid
The good god willing, we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chilling em, thrilling em, and red hot killing em
Killing em
Said killing em
Kill em

Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well
Ring a bell, hard to tell if anything is going to sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail
But users, cheaters, six time losers
Hand around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters

Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's something' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Look out, kid, because it's something' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hidEmbed
