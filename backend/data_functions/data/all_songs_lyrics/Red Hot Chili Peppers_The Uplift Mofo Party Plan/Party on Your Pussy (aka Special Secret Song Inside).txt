Party on Your Pussy (aka Special Secret Song Inside) Lyrics
Well, my landlady, she lives
Three houses away
And she claims that she can hear my baby screaming to me
"Fuck me Anthony, Anthony"

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah

Struck by lust in a telephone booth
Busted by a cop; he said "That's uncouth"
He said that she can hear my baby screaming to me
"Fuck me Anthony, Anthony"

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me shine your diamond
The girl got a scratch
Slap that cat
Have mercy

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
