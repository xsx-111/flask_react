Funky Crime Lyrics
Do it
Yeah, sing it!
Why do you do what you do?
I do what I want to do
Who said you could do what you do?
I told you who told me to
I do what I want to do
I do what I want to do

A funky crime, funky crime
A-don't you know funk's colorblind?
Well, I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind

Hey you, Mister Interview
I don't have to answer you
This is what I grew into
Don't judge me and my soul stew
Funk is my attitude
Funk is my attitude

Funky crime, funky crime
A-don't you know funk's colorblind?
Well, I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind
Barriers of race
In the media take place
Tellin' you there is no room
For what you do, a-don't budge
There's no groove to your cold gloom
And who made you the judge?
Always room for funky tunes
And yes I funk it up
I funk it up, a-ha!

Funky boy
Meets a funky girl
Make it funky, baby
'Cause the funk is crazy
Why do you do what you do?
I do what I want to do
Who said you could do what you do?
I told you who told me to
I do what I want to do
I do what I want to do

Funky crime, funky crime
A-don't you know funk's colorblind?
Well, I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind
Funky crime
Funky crime
Funky, funky crime
The crime is funkyEmbed
