Love Trilogy Lyrics
My love comes, and when it does
It's a crazy kind of
Selective affection
My love flows like a wise guy's tie
In the zaniest of directions
My love protection, my love erection
You better get some of my infection
My love can be a-bigger than
The Hoover Dam
My love can hide behind
A grain of sand
My love for life is fuelled by
The love for my band
I love his mother and
The silly mixed-up man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh
And ask my dad
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues

My love is the Zulu groove
My love is coop-a-loop move
My love is lightning's blues
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is gettin' skin on my flute
My love, my love
My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby suckin' on his thumb
My love for the best set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
My love for a bunch of knuckleheads
My love for the sweet smell of bread
My love for the legs that I spread
My love for the fat natty dread
My love, my love
My love is my toes in the sand
My love is my dick in my hand
My love is my dope in the van
My love is my dick in your pantsEmbed
