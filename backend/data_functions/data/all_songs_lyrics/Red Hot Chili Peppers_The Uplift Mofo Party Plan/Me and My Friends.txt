Me and My Friends Lyrics
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

Like two sweet peas in an even sweeter pod
Well, that’s my friend and my friend’s name is Bob
Like the devil knows Hell, I know Bobby well
Well enough to tell you ‘bout his sixty-seven smells
Well enough to tell you he’s a hella swell-a fellow
Well enough to tell you that we know each other better
Than we know ourselves
Like freaks of a feather, we rock together
I know Bobby well, but I think he knows me better

Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

He’s as close to me as a friend can be
Well, I’ll be standin’ by my buddy, he’ll be standin’ by me
Just another half of the two-headed freak
But I need him like my heart needs to beat
At this point in this friendly verse
I’ve gotta sing a little something that I haven’t rehearsed
It’s about my man and his name is Hillel
For whom my love is soul-brother sacred
Take it Huckleberry, Slim Boy, take it
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

Jacky’s eyes are closed but he’s right on course
Because he’s guided by the invisible force
He drives a kooky green Chrysler bad as anybody’s Porsche
He’s a working class drummer, he’s as strong as a horse

Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friendsEmbed
