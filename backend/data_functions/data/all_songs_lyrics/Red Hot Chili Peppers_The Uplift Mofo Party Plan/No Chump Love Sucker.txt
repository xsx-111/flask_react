No Chump Love Sucker Lyrics
She's a witch, a brat, a bonafide bore
What's more - she snores, and that is a fact
Cow eyes lie, yes it's time to resist
How did I ever get into this?
How could I ever have kissed that bitch?
So what if she has got big tits

She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit

She came like a cat like a cat to catnip
She came in my lap with her womanly hips
When I first met her I came unglued
When I played the part of a blue-blooded fool
I'm through with your sewage, I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd get the last laugh

She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit
Like two trains on one track are bound for a crash
Two red white and blues we were destined to clash
I can't fix the future, I can't change the past
Like fly by night news we were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish, I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by you and your wack attack
Jump back for chump love
You won't be back for cover
But no no no no
I'm no chump love sucker

No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker

I thought that your love was a matter of fact
But I lost my pride when I realized that
The smack in my bag and my baseball bat
Was all you were after you dirty rat
She's a bitch and a brat and a living disaster
She thought she was fast, boys, but I was faster
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love suckerEmbed
