Backwoods Lyrics
Someone spilled blood many years ago
Someone spilled blood but do you know
That from the backwoods where the Chuck Berrys grow
Come your long tall daddies of rock and roll

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now

Spinning down from the clouds like a tornado
Spinnin’ out of control like a psychedelic soul
With a rhythm hitting harder than Larry Holmes
Come your long tall daddies of rock and roll, oh no

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Yeah

Mr. Uplift Mofo, my man Bo Diddley
Hit sipping a bottle of nickel ripple
Play the lickity split finger lickin’ licks
For all you wicked city slick chicks
And all you nitty gritty hicks
We’ll make your nipples ripple
Make you wanna dip your dipple
Make you wanna soak your hickory stick
That’s right
Because my man has a grip on it
And I do mean on it
Which brings to mind
A very sinister minister kind of guy
A man named Little Richard
Who was born to make them bitches stir
That’s right he’ll make the sweet substance drip
From the middle of your hillbilly lips
And like the farmer milks his cow
The Howling Wolf will howl
And since times does allow
You all can take me to your backwoods now
Yo, Slim
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now, wow
Take me to your backwoodsEmbed
