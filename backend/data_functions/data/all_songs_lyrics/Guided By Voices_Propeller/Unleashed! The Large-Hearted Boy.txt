Unleashed! The Large-Hearted Boy Lyrics
In a world you think you understand
Stay put and tune to another planet
It's up to you to stay put
The shoe is on the other foot

Driven to the fields, whipped like a slave
Ready for the out
Ready for the beast, unleashed!
The large-hearted boy

In a world you think you understand
Stay put and tune to another planet
It's up to you to stay put
The shoe is on the other foot

Driven to the fields, whipped like a slave
Ready for the out
Ready for the beast, unleashed!
The large-hearted boyEmbed
