Metal Mothers Lyrics
Tune in rock star, there's no dark spot running around your face
You find time to get laid, you find ways to get paid
You don't see no busted rain clouds watering up your days
And so set in your ways and so fixed in your gaze

They're calling out for more, you're breaking out in time
It sounds just like a war and everybody's blind
You're digging out some more and now it's time to fly
To sleep sound in the ghost town away

If you could just stay
A terrible way
Hanging out there, areas of gray
Got most of it motioned away
Got a life to lead oceans away

Tune in rock star, there's no dark spot running around your face
You find time to get laid, you find ways to get paid
You don't see no busted rain clouds watering up your days
And so set in your ways and so fixed in your gaze
