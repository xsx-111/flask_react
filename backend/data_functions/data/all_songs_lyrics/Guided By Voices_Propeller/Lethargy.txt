Lethargy Lyrics
Are you happy, happy today?
Is your face, face mask on?
For the air is thick and the clouds are moving so slowly

There's a book of instructions to the rusty time machine
That goes to there, but really nowhere
I wish I could give a shit, just a little bit
What's the difference?

Hey, lethargy
Lethargy
Lethargy
Lethargy
Lethargy
Lethargy
Lethargy
