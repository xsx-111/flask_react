Weedking Lyrics
Long live Rockathon
Offspring and tag-alongs were finding
The history book has lost its binding
Pages everywhere
To the titans without care we'll read them
We conjure ghosts and then we feed them
And if it all goes well we'll laugh a lot
And then take photographs

Of what we made, lemonade
Freedom cake, quick to bake
Trim the tree collectively
Breath the air from the fair
And watch colored lights shine down
Dancing 'round the lady's face
As we learned the sound
We can't keep this violent pace
Though we know that haste makes waste
And I'm giving you a ring

For the dreams of the weed king, we all sing
For the dreams of the weed king, we all sing
For the dreams of the weed king, we all sing
For the dreams of the weed king, we all sing
For the dreams of the weed king, we all sing
For the dreams of the weed king, we all sing (drink on)
For the dreams of the weed king, we all sing (yeah)
For the dreams of the weed king
Stop!Embed
