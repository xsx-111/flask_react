On the Tundra Lyrics
On the tundra
We went under
We're going under now
On the tundra
We went to vicious places
Of dark and punished faces
Couldn't shake it
Or outgrow it
Swung hell’s gate open now
Don't we know it

‘Cause with my second guessing
The subjects for the testing
Look over our blunders
Our two-fisted wonders

The foxy wildest monster's dial is
More peaceful than a human hammer
The great pretend transmissionaries
Evolving without you, dissolving without you
As you know, it's just too slow on the tundra

And then one day
Maybe today
We'll justify the joke
Make it our day
And blow the total savings
To satisfy our cravings
Look over our blunders
Our two-fisted wonders

The foxy wildest monster's dial is
More peaceful than a human hammer
The great pretend transmissionaries
Evolving without you, dissolving without you
As you know, it's just too slow
Evolving without you, dissolving without you
As you know, it's just too slow
Evolving without you, dissolving without you
As you know, it's just too slow
Evolving without you, dissolving without you
As you know, it's just too slow
Evolving without you, dissolving without you
As you know, it's just too slowEmbed
