14 Cheerleader Coldfront Lyrics
Fourteen cheerleader coldfront, point your nose beyond
Creeping boys in alleys find them when you're gone

Stick close to locker rooms and waving clothes to wear
You will hold them dear to something queer and stare

Sixteen used companions have nowhere to stay
Give them access to parking spaces, no coin meters there

Stick close to locker rooms and waving clothes to wear
You will hold them dear to something queer and stare
You will hold them dear to something queer and stareEmbed
