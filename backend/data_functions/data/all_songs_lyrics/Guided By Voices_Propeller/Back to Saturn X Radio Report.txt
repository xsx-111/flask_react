Back to Saturn X Radio Report LyricsThe lifeblood, the lighthouse flashing
Sixteen chicks remain on watch
Sopor Joe, you oughta know
How to move fast and how to move slow
Here come the fantasy creeps
They're all around you
They're here to give you the creeps
They've come to hound you
Back to Saturn X
We are having the time of our lives
We are having the time of your lives
All the way (ooh la, la la la)
To the walls (oh)
Anything for free
Anything for free
Off and onward
In the chance I took, I'm a broken horse
I'm the one who's no good in your eyes
Anything for free
Anything for freeEmbed
