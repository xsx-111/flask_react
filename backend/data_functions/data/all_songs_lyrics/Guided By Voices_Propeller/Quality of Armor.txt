Quality of Armor Lyrics
Oh, yeah, I'm going to drive my car
Oh, yeah, I'm going to go real far

As we were sitting there in the final stages
Staring at the screen as the battle rages
You were finding God in the dictionary
Taking photographs in the cemetery

Oh, yeah, I'm going to drive my car
Oh, yeah, I'm going to go real far
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout

The worst offense is intelligence
Your best defense is belligerence
How we stalemate our predicament
Governed by tissue and filament

Oh, yeah, I'm going to drive my car
Oh, yeah, I'm going to go real far
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma halls
(Oh, yeah, I'm going to drive my car)
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
(Oh, yeah, I'm going to go real far)
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma halls
(Oh, yeah, I'm going to drive my car)
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
(Oh, yeah, I'm going to go real far)
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma halls
(Oh, yeah, I'm going to drive my car)
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
(Oh, yeah, I'm going to go real far)
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma hallsEmbed
