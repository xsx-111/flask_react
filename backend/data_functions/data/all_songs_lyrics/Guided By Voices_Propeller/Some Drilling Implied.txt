Some Drilling Implied LyricsI dare not say
The way I feel
About your inability to
Suck it up and win the game
Chew me up and spit me out
It's been a long ugly winter
I need a sunbath, a winning horse
Of course, I'm not complaining
I'm simply dying
Yes, I'm waiting
Got a good love left
Good Lord willing
Got a tractor to tow
The house on fantasy farm
For the new corn belt
To the new Bible belt
Take me to the pilot light
And sing me to sleep
You fantasy creepEmbed
