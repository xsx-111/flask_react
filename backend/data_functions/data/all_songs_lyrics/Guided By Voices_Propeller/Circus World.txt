Circus World Lyrics
They just don't understand me
And they never will
This, all we do, we do for you
Shit gets old and demanding
It never fails to amaze me
When I see it all before me

A power freak who self-destructs
The rightful boys in monster trucks
The painted sluts training monkey men
I'll call to the door but they won't let me in
And the human fly gets smashed again
He mixes his blood with tonic and gin
And I choke on the sheep stuck in the company of wolves
As you raise up on your hind hooves

Daylight breaks
I see a face that used to cry
Where were you then?
Somewhere off to yourself

Too many people involved in the gameEmbed
