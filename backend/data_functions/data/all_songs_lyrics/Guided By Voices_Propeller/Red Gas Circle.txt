Red Gas Circle Lyrics
We went ahead, we went ahead
And set it up and knocked it down
You see it falling and now it's crumbling
To the cold, unforgivable ground

You did it, you had a hand in it
And now it's circling around
Oh, yeah, it's circling around
I'm coming back to this world to get things straight

Hey, are you coming?
Please don't be late
Hey, are you coming?
Please don't be late
Hey, are you coming?
Please don't be late
I just can't waitEmbed
