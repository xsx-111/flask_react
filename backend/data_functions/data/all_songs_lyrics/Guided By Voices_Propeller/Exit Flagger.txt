Exit Flagger Lyrics
I don't know where I've come from
And I don't know where I'm off to
And I need to find a way out
And he's here to help me find it

Exit flagger, exit flagger
Exit flagger, exit flagger
I'm not going to race you today

I need a life as same as
And I don't believe in anything
I promise to leave you one of these days
I promise it'll be real soon

Exit flagger, exit flagger
Exit flagger, exit flagger
I'm not going to race you today

I promise to leave you
I promise to leave you
I promise to leave you
I promise to leave youEmbed
