Ergo Space Pig Lyrics
Motion bingo, Ergo's the cap, he is the man
And why do you watch him, over and over?
Speed up, slow down

Ergo space pig
Ergo space pig

Come in, come in
The devil's star pupil, he is a buzz
And how do you get there?
Radio wave wipe-out
Ships have been launched

Ergo space pig
Ergo space pig
Ergo space pig
