Brother My Cup Is Empty Lyrics
Brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home
Oh brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home

I am the captain of my pain
Tis the bit, the bridle
The thrashing cane
The stirrup, the harness
And he whipping mane
The pickled eye
And the shrinking brain
Brother, buy me one more drink
Explain the nature of my pity
Let me tell you once again
I am the captain of my pain

Brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home
I cannot blame it all on her
To blame her all would be a lie
For many a night I lay awake
And wished that I could watch her die
See her accusing finger spurt
See flies swarm her hateful eye
To watch her groaning in the dirt
See her clicking tongue crack dry
Brother, buy me one more drink
One more drink and then goodbye
And do not mock me when I say
Let's drink one more before I die

Brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home

I've been sliding down on rainbows
I've been swinging from the stars
This wretch in beggars clothing
Bangs his cup across the bars
Look, this cup of mine is empty!
Seems I've misplaced my desires
Seems I'm sweeping up the ashes
Of all my former fires
So brother, be a brother
And fill this tiny cup of mine
And please, sir, make it whiskey
I have no head for wine
Brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home
Oh brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home

I counted up my blessings
And counted only one
One tiny little blessing
And now that blessing's gone
So buy me one more drink, my brother
Then I'm taking to the road
Yes, I'm taking to the rain
And I'm taking to the snow
Oh my friend, my only brother
Do not let the party grieve
Throw a dollar on' the bar
Now kiss my ass and leave

Brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home
Brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go homeEmbed
