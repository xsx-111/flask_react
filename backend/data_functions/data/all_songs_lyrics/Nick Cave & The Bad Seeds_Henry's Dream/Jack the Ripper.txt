Jack the Ripper Lyrics
I got a woman
She rules my house with an iron fist  (Yeah-eah-ah, yeah-eah-ah)
I got a woman
She rules my house with an iron fist (Yeah-eah-ah, yeah-eah-ah)
She screams out Jack the Ripper
Every time I try to give that girl a kiss (Yeah-eah-ah, yeah-eah-ah)

Well I got a woman
She strikes me down with a fist of lead (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)
Well I got a woman
She strikes me down with a hand of lead (Yeah-eah-ah, yeah-eah-ah)
We bed in a bucket of butcher's knives
I awake with a hatchet hanging over my head (Yeah-eah-ah, yeah-eah-ah)

Well you know the story of the viper
It's long and lean with a poison tooth (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)
You know the story of the viper
It's long, it's lean, it's got a poison tooth (Yeah-eah-ah, yeah-eah-ah)
Well they're hissing under the floorboards
Hanging down in bunches from my roof (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)
Well I got a woman
She just hollers what she wants from where she's at (Yeah-eah-ah, yeah-eah-ah)
Well I got a woman
She just hollers what she wants from where she is (Yeah-eah-ah, yeah-eah-ah)
She screams out Jack the Ripper
Every time I try to give that girl a kiss (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)
Oh yeah (Yeah-eah-ah)Embed
