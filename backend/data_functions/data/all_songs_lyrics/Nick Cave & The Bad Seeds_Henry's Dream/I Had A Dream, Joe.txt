I Had A Dream, Joe Lyrics
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream, Joe

I had a dream, Joe
You were standing in the middle of an open road
I had a dream, Joe
Your hands were raised up to the sky
And your mouth was covered in foam
I had a dream, Joe
A shadowy Jesus, he flitted from tree to tree
I had a dream, Joe
The society of whores stuck needles in an image of me
I had a dream, Joe
It was Autumn time and thickly fell the leaves
And in that dream, Joe
A pimp in seersucker suit sucked a toothpick
And pointed his finger at me

I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream, Joe
I opened my eyes, Joe
The night had been a giant, dribbling and pacing the boards
I opened my eyes, Joe
All your letters and cards stacked up against the door
I opened my eyes, Joe
The morning light came slowly tumbling through the crack
In the window, Joe
And I thought of you, man, and I felt like I was lugging
A body on my back

I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream, Joe

Where did you go, Joe?
On that endless, on that senseless, on that demented drift
Where did you go, Joe?
It was into the woods, it was into the trees, where you move and shift
Where did you go, Joe?
All dressed up in your ridiculous seersucker suit
Where did you go, Joe?
With that strew of wreckage
Forever at the heel of your boot
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream, Joe
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream, Joe

I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream, JoeEmbed
