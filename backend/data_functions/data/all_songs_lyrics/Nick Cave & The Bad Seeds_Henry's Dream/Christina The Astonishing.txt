Christina The Astonishing Lyrics
Christina the Astonishing lived a long, long time ago
She was stricken with a seizure
At the age of twenty-two
They took her body in a coffin
To a tiny church in Liege
Where she sprang up from the coffin
Just after the Agnus Dei
She soared up to the rafters
Perched on a beam up there
Cried "The stink of human sin, the stink of human sin, the stink is more than I can bear"

And I said oh

Christina the Astonishing
Was the most astonishing of all
She prayed balanced on a hurdle
Or curled up into a ball
She fled to remote places
Climbed towers and trees and walls
To escape the stench of corruption
The stench of human corruption
Into an oven she did crawl
And I said oh

Christina the Astonishing
Behaved in a terrifying way
She would run wildly through the streets
Jump in the Meuse and swim away
Christina the Astonishing
Behaved in terrifying manner
Died at the age of seventy-four, died at the age of seventy-four
In The Convent of St Anna

And I said ohEmbed
