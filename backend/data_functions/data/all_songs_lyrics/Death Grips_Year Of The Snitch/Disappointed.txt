Disappointed Lyrics
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed

Called shots, cheap shots, slack jaws, low blows
Weak chins, chin checked, chin up like cholos
No life signs left, ah, yes, try mine
This thresh hold thresh, hold stretch, life times
Machine, human, malformed machine
Uninformed unit, forlorn regime
Metamorph me into done for at last
At least until my present shore has passed

Why me? Why me?
Why me? Why me?
Why me?!

Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed
Nut job, no job, fuck jobs, not hired
Low lands, road rash, war path, crossfire
Nonthreats, hot mess, known threats, stalk less
Talk less, show less, snatch yours trap doors
Ripper, ripper, skin tight, too tight
Too tight, holding solid, moonlight, moonlight
Moonlight, kevlar coated slit moon, lunar gush
Lunar gush, carry on carrion never been far enough
Hocus breaking in and centering
Broke in and gave up on everything, everything

Why me?!
Why me? Why me?
Why me? Why me?

Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed

Rot clot, corpse clutch, corpse clot, your husk
Scorned husk, born shook, torn trick, core breached
Shook, fuck, shit head, bitch, too short street
Shut, fuck up or fed, both, you're-
