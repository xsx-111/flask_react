Dilemma Lyrics
February 20th, Los Angeles, California
I’m in the studio with Death Grips
They’re working on their new album at Sunset Sound Studios
6650 Sunset Boulevard
They have a dilemma, but they’ll win their dilemma

Dilemma

Butterfly ballistic, seax survival
Butcher kukri to trench homicidal
Can’t say I buy them, just show up lately
Lately seem to stalk me like I’m yeti
Like scream of a haunted jetty
Let me be a haunted jetty
Cross I cry banshee like manic falcon
Shrill like losing time on Shasta Mountain

Thingany thingany, so jinx now
She’s wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wild
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style
Shine like sad hung from starry eyed gallows
Like day old glow of carbon eye shadow
Trembling young wounded mammal
Double edge gut judge choke on his gavel (Choke)
Jack slide leave atlantic puddles
Spade slip lives into stranded shuttles
I taxiderm shams with morbid shinto
This three quarter shank, one quarter disco (Choke)
Low res mega evil patina
Pattern maker of myth and trip weaver
Infamous nature in rags like reaper
Like midnight mounted by wayside seekers

Lovely, lovely, they’re so blonde
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
Dusty, dusty, so far gone
I’m fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fucking wrong

It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
These knives bleed knives
They cut me, I’ll cut you
Below is above you
Above is below me
I’m dying to try on these knives
You don’t know me
Dilemma
Dilemma

Thingany thingany, so jinx now
She’s wahwah wah-wah-wah-wild
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style13Embed
