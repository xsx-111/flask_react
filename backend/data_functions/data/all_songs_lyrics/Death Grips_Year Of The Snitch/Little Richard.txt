Little Richard Lyrics
Little Richard took a picture
He got triggered by the click'a
He got beat up, he got bigger

Little Richard, Little Richard

Little Richard, he's in the dorms
He's gonna bomb and look good when he bombs, in the dorms
Maria Sharapova, yes, as good as anyone's guess

Little Richard, Little Richard

He just needs to A, B, C, and D
He just needs the world to be what he has seen

In the horn section, they hide weapons
Bottom of a white bic, chewed up like a pig's dick

Little Richard, Little Richard4Embed
