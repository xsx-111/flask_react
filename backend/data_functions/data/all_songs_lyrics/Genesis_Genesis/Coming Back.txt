Coming Back Lyrics
I'm comin' back
Hey, yeah, I'm comin'
I'm comin' back
Hey, yeah, I'm comin'

It's a cold world, baby, but I'm a cold nigga
Frostbite tryna take a chew of how I slither
My presence give 'em chills, like an Antarctican winter
And I'm bangin' Inglewood 'til I'm gettin' caught with a splinter
I'm havin' artists for dinner
So many fall apart when I spark, it's hard to remember
It's always hard rememberin' pain is part of the riddle
Somewhere between my art and the dark, I'm parked in the middle
I knew my part since was little
I knew my heart was official
I knew that in my heart that that boy was part of a bigger plan
I know my momma not comin' up short of rent again
'Cause I put this rap shit down and go and sin again
Fuck all the daps and pounds, I'm on my shit again
All that bad mouthin' just runnin' up my adrenaline
And yeah, it's safe to say we made a way
From gettin' slouched on
And Doms'll be that nigga from now on, you dig me?
Nothin' to do 'cept smoke and drive (Smoke and drive)
Twenty in your pocket, million on your mind (On your mind)
And someone had the drink, someone had the drugs
Someone had bitches on the line, that's just what it was (What it was)
And I don't regret a single night I came home fucked up
Ain't sorry for a single time I made hoes cry
Money was a thing I didn't make too much of
Tell me "Hurry up," I'ma take my time (My time)

I feel like I'm designed for this
I don't know how on my timin' is
But I know I won't have time again
To give this all I got, ayy

All my clouds got silver linings
Amazin' how I keep my peace alive through all this violence
It's a war outside my window, it's like all I hear is sirens
But it's somethin' 'bout the melody, I'm driftin' into science
I was born hateful, lookin' at this world ugly
Way at the bottom, got me questionin' if God love me
You know my steez dog, real niggas ride gully
Lost a couple soldiers, got me smokin' with my eyes runny
My heart cold like I said in the first verse
And I'm tryna eat, you niggas eyein' dessert first
And somewhere between the hoes and money, I got hurt the worst
I swear to God this life a gift and a curse
My path was chosen way before I existed, the misfit
The voices in my head never tell me wrong, so I listen
Either make a way or collision
I ain't here to play, nigga, I'm on a mission
Nothin' to do 'cept smoke and drive (I hear that) (Smoke and drive)
Twenty in your pocket, million on your mind (On your mind)
And someone had the drink, someone had the drugs
Someone had bitches on the line, that's just what it was (What it was)
And I don't regret a single night I came home fucked up
Ain't sorry for a single time I made hoes cry
Money was a thing I didn't make too much of
Tell me "Hurry up," I'ma take my time (My time)
