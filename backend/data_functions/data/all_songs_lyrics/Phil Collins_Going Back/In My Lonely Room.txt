In My Lonely Room Lyrics
Every single time
You take me out with you
You always flirt around
With someone new
But I never criticize
The tearful things you do
Cause I'm so afraid
Of losing you

But in my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
Cause I just lock my door
And let myself go and
Lay right down and cry

Every place we go
People are whispering
About your flirting ways
And it hurts me so to hear
Oh but in the public's eye
I just push behind
All my hurt inside
And pretend I don't mind
But in my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
In my lonely room (Your my lonely room)
Tears I don't have to hide (Tears I don't have to hide)
In my lonely room (Your my lo... In my lonely room)
Tears I don't have to hide (I don't have to hide...)Embed
