Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue) Lyrics
I love you, girl, with all my heart and soul
I can't understand why you treat me cold
Your every wish, girl, is my command
And that's why I can't seem to understand why

Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
I'm asking you girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue?

One day you say you love me too
The next day you tell me that we are through
My love for you is just a game
But each time we play, girl, my heart feels the pain

Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
I'm asking you girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue?
So blue...

Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl, tell me why can't you be true?
The way you treat me, it just isn't fair
You make it so plain you just don't care
You have a ball around my time
Of sleepless nights I'm getting tired
Girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue?
I'm asking you girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue, Come on tell me
Girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue?
Oh oh girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue?
Come on tell me
Girl, girl,girl why you want to make me blue?Embed
