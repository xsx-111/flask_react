Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While) Lyrics
I know you're leaving me behind
I'm seeing you, darling, for the very last time
Show a little tenderness before you go
Please let me feel your embrace once more

Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, rock me, rock me a little while
We all must feel heartache sometime
Right now, right now, now, I'm feeling mine

I tried my best to be strong, but I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child wrapped in a cradle
Let me know joy before I grieve
Just once more, darling, before you leave

Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, rock me, rock me a little while
I'm losing you and my happiness
My life is over, I must confess

I'll never, never see your smiling face no more
I'll never, never hear your knock on my door
Before you leave me, leave me behind
Please let me feel happy just one more time
Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, and rock me, rock me a little while

I said I never wouldn't beg, I said I wouldn't plead
Here I am, baby, begging you please
Baby, baby, please, baby, baby, please

Baby, take me in your arms
Come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darlingEmbed
