Papa Was a Rolling Stone Lyrics
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
Cause that was the day, that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothing but bad things about him
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma hung her head and said

Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone

Hey Momma!
Is it true what they say that Papa never worked a day, in his life?
And Momma, there some bad talk going round town that Papa had three outside children
And another wife
Heard them talk about Papa doing some store front preaching
Talked about saving souls and all the time leaching
Dealing in debt, stealing in the name of the law
Momma hung her head and said
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Son, Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Oh yeah

Come on, tell me, hey Momma
I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me is that what sent Papa to an early grave
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills

Folks say Papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth

Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
You know. Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stoneEmbed
