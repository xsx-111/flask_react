You Really Got a Hold on Me Lyrics
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinkin' of you
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly
But I love you madly

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

I don't want you
But I need you
I don't wanna kiss you
But I need to
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Baby
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Tighter
Tighter

I wanna leave you
Don't wanna stay here
Don't wanna spend another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna split now
I just can't quit now

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Yeah, you really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Yeah, you really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)Embed
