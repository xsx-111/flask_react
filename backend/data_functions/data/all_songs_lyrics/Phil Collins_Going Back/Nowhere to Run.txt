Nowhere to Run LyricsNowhere to run to, baby
Got nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run to, baby
Got nowhere to hide
It's not love
I'm running from
It's the heartbreak
I know will come
'Cause I know
You're no good for me
But you've become
A part of me
Everywhere I go
Your face I see
Every step I take
You take with me, yeah
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run to, baby
Got nowhere to hide
I know you're
No good for me
But free of you
I'll never be, no
Each night as I sleep
Into my heart you creep
I wake up feeling sorry I met you
Hoping soon that I'll forget you
When I look in the mirror
To comb my hair
I see your face
Just a-smiling there
Got nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Got nowhere to hide
I know you're
No good for me
But you've become
A part of me
How can I fight a lover
That shouldn't leave
When it's so deep, so deep
Deep inside of me
When my love is so high
I can't get over it
It's so wide
That I can't get around it, no
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
From you, baby
Just can't get away from you baby
No matter how I try
Well I know you're no good for me
But free of you I'll never be
Got nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run, baby
Got nowhere to hide
Got nowhere ro run, nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to hideEmbed
