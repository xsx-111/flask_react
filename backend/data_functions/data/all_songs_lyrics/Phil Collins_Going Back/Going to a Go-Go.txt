Going to a Go-Go Lyrics
Going to a go go
Going to a go go
Na na na na, yeah

Well, there's a brand new place I've found
Where people go from miles around
They come from everywhere
And if you drop in there
You might see anyone in town

Going to a go go, everybody's
Going to a go go, well, come on now
Don't you want to go, yeah

One more time, yeah I'm
Going to a go go, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Going to a go go, baby come on now

It doesn't matter where you are
A go go can be far
You'll see the people from your block
And don't be shocked
If you see your favorite star

Na na na na yeah, ooh tell me
Don't you want to go, yeah
Now it's alright, I-yi
Going to a go go, yes I am now
Going to a go go, oh come on now

It doesn't matter if you don't stagger
It doesn't matter if you don't drag
You should have some fun
I'm telling everyone
Most every taxi that you flag is

Going to a go go, oh come on baby
Going to a go go, baby come on now
Don't you want to go, yeah
One more time, yeah

I'm going to a go go
Going to a go go, baby come on now
Going to a go go, oh come on baby
Going to a go go, oh come on now
Going to a go goEmbed
