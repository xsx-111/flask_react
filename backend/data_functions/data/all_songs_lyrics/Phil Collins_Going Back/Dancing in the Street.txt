Dancing in the Street LyricsCallin' out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancin' in the streets
They're dancin' down in Chicago
(Dancing in the street)
Down in New Orleans
(Dancing in the street)
Up in New York City
(Dancing in the street)
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swingin', swayin' and records playin'
And dancing in the street
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
There'll be dancing
(Dancing in the street)
They're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
This is an invitation
Across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughin' and singin' and music swingin'
And dancing in the streets
Philadelphia, P.A. (Dancing in the street)
Baltimore and DC now (Dancing in the street)
Can't forget the Motor City (Dancing in the street)
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swingin', swayin' and records playin'
And dancing in the street, yeah
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
There'll be dancing dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
Way down in LA, everyday
They're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
Across the ocean to you, me and you
They're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
Everyone you meet, oh, they're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)Embed
