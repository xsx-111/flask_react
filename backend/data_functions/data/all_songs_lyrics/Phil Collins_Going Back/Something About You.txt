Something About You Lyrics
Darling, darling
If I could have you to call my very own
I work my fingers through the bone, I am alone
To you I'd always come home

Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
There's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more

Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Sweet sweet thing, you set my soul on fire
I need you, yeah, badly
No matter what price I have to pay
Because without you, darling, I'd worry hard
I love you anyway


Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Sweet sweet thing, you're my only desire
I'm just your puppet on a string
And tears sometimes it brings
But do me any way you wanna when you wanna
I'll keep you just the same


You're a real heart breaker
You will never let me sit down
There's something about you, baby
That shakes me all up inside
You're a real heart breaker
And I need you just the sameEmbed
