What Child Is This Anyway? LyricsWhat child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
"Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary!"
Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails, spears shall pierce Him through
The cross He bore for me, for you
Hail, hail the Word made flesh
The Babe, the Son of Mary
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Raise, raise the song on high
The Virgin sings her lullaby
"Joy, joy, for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary!"Embed
