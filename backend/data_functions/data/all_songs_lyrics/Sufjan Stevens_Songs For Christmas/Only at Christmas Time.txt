Only at Christmas Time LyricsOnly to bring you peace
Only at Christmas time
Only the King of Kings
Only what once was mine
It takes the end of time
It takes a long, long time
Only one thought of mine
Only at Christmas time
He brings us peace
He brings us joy
He brings all thoughts to destroy
(Only at Christmas time)
To bring us peace
To bring us joy
To bring all thoughts to destroy
(Only at Christmas time)
Only at Christmas time
Only a tree to climb
Only at Christmas time
If you can read the sign
Only at Christmas time
Everything lost will find
Only at Christmas time
Only at Christmas timeEmbed
