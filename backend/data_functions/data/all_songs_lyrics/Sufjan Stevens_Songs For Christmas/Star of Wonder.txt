Star of Wonder Lyrics
I call you from the comet's cradle
I found you trembling by yourself
When the night falls
Lightly on your right-winged shoulder
Wonderful know-it-all
Slightly where the night gets colder

Oh, conscience, where will you carry me?
I found you, star of terrifying effigies
When the night falls, I carry myself to the fortress
Of your glorious cost
Oh, how I may seek your fortress
When the night falls
We see the star of wonder
Wonderful night falls
We see you
We see you there

I see the stars coming down there
Coming down there to the yard
I see the stars coming down there
Coming down there to my heart
(These days, days, days run away like horses over the hills...)2Embed
