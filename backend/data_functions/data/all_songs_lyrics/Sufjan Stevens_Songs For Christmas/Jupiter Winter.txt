Jupiter Winter LyricsOh, Father Christmas
Come to us, come to us
Perfect and with us
Come to us, come to us
Oh, Mother Mary
Celebrate, celebrate
Brave sanctuary
Come to us, come to us
Explorations end in crimes
Decorations left behind
Where will you call, where will you call, where will you call?
Troubled heart, troubled heart here withal
Oh, Christian Winter
Call to us, call to us
Jupiter Winter, Regulus, Regulus
Oh, Star of Wisdom
Light of light, light of light
Casperus Prism
Bride of life, bride of life
Disappointment to the end
Hold your temper, too, my friend
Where will you call, where will you call, where will you call?
Troubled heart, troubled heart here withalEmbed
