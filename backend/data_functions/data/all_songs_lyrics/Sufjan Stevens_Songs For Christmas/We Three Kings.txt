We Three Kings Lyrics
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traveled so far
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star

O, star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Glorious now behold Him arise
King and God and sacrifice
"Hallelujah! Halleljujah!"
Earth to heaven replies

O, star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to Thy perfect lightEmbed
