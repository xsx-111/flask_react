Did I Make You Cry on Christmas Day? (Well, You Deserved It!) LyricsThis time of year, you always disappear
You tell me not to call
You tell me not to call
And when the door is closed, you're wearing different clothes
Or hiding in the paper, pretending not to hear
Inexpensive wine
I buy it all the time
You tell me take it back
You say you'll take a nap
But I can see it now
You always tell me how
I could do so much better
You said it in your letter
Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I let you down
Like every other day?
Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I let you down
On Christmas day?
The bed that isn't made
The broken window shade
The radiator song, I loved you all along
But I can see it now
You always tell me how
I could do so much better
You said it in your letter
I stay awake at night
After we have a fight
I'm writing poems about you
And they're not very nice
I didn't mean to yell
I said I couldn't tell
I only grabbed your wrist
Or would you rather we kissed?
Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I make you cry
Like every other day?
Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I make you cry?4Embed
