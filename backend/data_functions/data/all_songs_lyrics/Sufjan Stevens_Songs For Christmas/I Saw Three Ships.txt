I Saw Three Ships Lyrics
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day in the morning
And what was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?
And what was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning?

Mary mild and Christ were there
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Mary mild and Christ were there
On Christmas Day in the morning
And all the bells on earth did ring
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And all the bells on earth did ring
On Christmas Day in the morning

And all the angels in heaven did sing
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And all the angels in heaven did sing
On Christmas Day in the morning
Then let us all rejoice again
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Then let us all rejoice again
On Christmas Day in the morning!
Well I played terrible
Did you?Embed
