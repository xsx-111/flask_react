Bring a Torch, Jeanette, Isabella Lyrics
Bring the torch, Jeanette, Isabella
Bring the torch, come swiftly and run
Christ is born, tell the folk of the village
Jesus is sleeping in His cradle
Ah, ah, beautiful is the mother
Ah, ah beautiful is her Son

Hasten now, good folk of the village
Hasten now, the Christ Child to see
You will find him asleep in the manger
Quietly come and whisper softly
Hush, hush, peacefully now he slumbers
Hush, hush, peacefully now he sleepsEmbed
