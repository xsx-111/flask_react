Get Behind Me, Santa! Lyrics
I know what you're doing to me, boy
You move so fast like a psychopathic color TV
With your Christmas bag and your jolly face
And the reindeer stomping all over the place

Take it easy, what you got to be so absurd?
You make it sound like Christmas is a four-letter word
It's a fact of life whether you like it or not
So put your hands together and give it a shot

I hope that you take it to heart, boy
'Cause Christmas time ain't no clowning around
And if you think you got something to prove, boy
Santa Claus is coming to town

I don't care about family and shopping malls
Candy canes or the carolers decking the halls
I don't care about what you say, Santa Claus
You're a bad brother breaking into peoples' garages!
You got it wrong 'cause I'm just another regular guy
With superpowers and a penchant for the Yuletide
Is it a crime to give a little once in a while?
I travel 'round the world trying to make people smile
I know that you take it to heart, boy
'Cause Christmas time ain't no clowning around
And if you think you got something to prove, boy
Santa Claus is coming to town

C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S! C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!
C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S! C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!
C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S! C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!
C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S! C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!

Christmas time! Christmas time! Christmas time!
We're having a good time!
Christmas time! Christmas time! Christmas time!
We're having... a good time!Embed
