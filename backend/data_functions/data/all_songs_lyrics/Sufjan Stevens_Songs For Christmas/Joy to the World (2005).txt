Joy to the World (2005) LyricsJoy to the world! The Lord has come
Let earth receive her King!
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
Joy to the earth! The Saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
No more let sins and sorrows grow
Nor thorns infest the ground
He comes to make his blessings flow
Far as the curse is found
He rules the earth with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness
And wonders of his loveEmbed
