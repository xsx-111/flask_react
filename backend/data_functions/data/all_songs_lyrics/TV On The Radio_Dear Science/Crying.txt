Crying Lyrics
Laugh in the face of death under masthead
Hold your breath through late breaking disasters
Next to news of the trite
And the codes and the feelings
That meant to be noble
Like coke in the nose of the nobles
Keeps it alight
And the wrath and the riots
And the races on fire
And the music for tanks with no red lights in sight

Got you crying
Crying
Oh why-ing
Oh my, my, my

Gold is another word for culture
Leads to fattening of the vultures
'Til this bird can barely fly
And Mary and David smoke dung in the trenches
While Zion's behavior never gets mentioned
The writings, on your wall
And the blood on the cradle
And the ashes you wade through
Got you calling God's name in vain
Leaved the damned to damn it all

Broken rose-colored glasses
Can't see for the thorns
And you just can't stand no more
What a clumsy kind of low
Time to take the wheel and the road from the masters
Take this car, drive it straight into the wall
Build it back up from the floor

And stop our crying
Crying
Oh why-ing
Oh my, my, my

Our crying
Still you try, try, tryEmbed
