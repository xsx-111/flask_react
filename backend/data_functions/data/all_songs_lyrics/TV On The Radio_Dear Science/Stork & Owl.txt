Stork & Owl Lyrics
Faceless fall from this life and ah
If you can't see the stars, you've probably gone too far
Like the voice that cried on the lonesome tide
Like the wave was the only love it ever saw
"What's this dying for?" asks the Stork that soars
With the Owl high above canyons' mighty walls
Owl said, "Death's a door that love walks through
In and out, in and out, back and forth, back and forth"

Turn from the fear of the storms that might be
Oh, let it free, that caged on fire thing
Oh, hold its hands, it'll feel like lightning
Oh, in your arms, safe from the storms

Sky bends, the moon's dress's slung low, slung low
Dog star taught a dance
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Arms out, knees bend, the motion flows
Like the soft open petals of a Jessica Rose
So Sirius, and so it falls apart
It just reveals the perfect nothing
Of everything you are, of everything we are
Candle of life lights the blights and bruises
Oh, lay it down in the night, let it soothe this
Oh, hold its hands and we'll know what truth is
Oh, in its arms, safe from the stormsEmbed
