Family Tree Lyrics
Under my love
Wake up to your window
The day calls in billows
It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart
In cozy red rainbow
It's shaking off halos
And the memory of our sacred so and so
Oh, take my hand sweet
Complete your release, unbury your feet
And married we'll be
Alone in receiving ours is a feeling not that they would see
They don't know that we could be
Down where your cradle escaped the sea
And your raven haired mama caught told you so's

We're hanging in the shadow of your family tree
Your haunted heart and me
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts or three
Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep it young

Ah me all mine
Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently
Call me on time
And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully
All into line
There's a garden grave and a place there saved for me
I fall by your side
Though your silver haired mama throws told you so's
We're hanging in the shadow of your family tree
Your haunted heart and me
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts or three
Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep it young

And now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree
In halted harmony
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts or three
Pumping blood to the roots of Eden to keep us youngEmbed
