Halfway Home LyricsThe lazy way they turned your head
Into a rest stop for the dead
And did it all in gold and blue and gray
The efforts to allay your dread
In spite of all you knew and said
Were hard to see and harder still to say
A comfort plush all laced in lead
Was sent to quell your sentiment
And keep your trembling sentinel hand at bay
And when a sudden silhouette
Escaped the top side of your bed
I knew you'd never ever be the same
Ah, is it not me
Am I not folded by your touch
The words you spoke, I know too much
It's over now and not enough
Ah, is it not me
The damage you hold inside your blush
The load you towed, you showed it up
It's over now and I'm insane
Wild spirit winds from out your chest
Collides with world and wilderness
It needs a gentle hand to call it home
Now surfs the sun and scales the moon
And winds the waistband of her womb
All eyes ablaze the day you break your mold
Ah, is it not me
Am I not culled into your clutch
The words you spoke, I know too much
We're closer now and said enough
Ah, is it not me
Am I not rolled into your crush
The road you chose unloads control
See it take me so
Go on throw this stone
Into this halfway home3Embed
