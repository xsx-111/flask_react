I Dreamed I Dream Lyrics
Look before you leap, okay?
Do you read me?
May all your dreams come true
He's standing by the door
He's got something in his hands
All the money's gone
All the money's gone
The days we spend, go on and on
Do you  with each step
Did I drift?
Do I re-dream?
Do you read me?
I'm not speaking with you
Do you read me?
I dreamed
Shift
Fucking youth
Working youth
I dream
May all your dreams come true
Sounds today, I hear the sound today, I hear the sound of todayA lot of people
Suffer from impotenceSounds today, I hear the sound today, I hear the sound of todayAll the money's goneToday (You sing it on that one automatically)The days we spent go on and onThe dream
Fucking youth
Working youth
Fucking youth
Working youth
Fucking youth
Working youth
You know who would teach us that one?
Days we spent go on and on
I dream
Do you read me?2Embed
