Long Gone Day Lyrics
So much blood I'm starting to drown
Runs from cold to colder
Time to time the sky's comin' down
To help me lose my way
Tears and lies for answers
You and open veins, God knows I'm gone
Girl I just want you to come on down
Lord it's a storm in my head and I fall
These sins are mine and I've done wrong, oh babe
Come on down
Come on down my babe, wrong time I know

Long gone day (Woah, woah-oh yeah)
Who ever said we'd wash away with the rain?

See you all from time to time
Isn't it so strange how far away we all are now?
Am I the only one who remembers that summer?
Oh-woah, I remember
Everyday each time the place was saved
The music that we made
The wind has carried all of that away
Long gone day
Who ever said we'd wash away with the rain?


So many tears I'm starting to drown
The rain in heaven's all come down
Silver spoons affix the crown
The luckless ones are broken
Fears and lies for answers
You and open flames
God knows I'm gone
And I just want you to
Come on down
Lord it's a storm in my head and I fall
These sins are mine and I've done wrong
I want you to, oh, I just want you to
Come on down


I fear again, like then, I've lost my way
And shout to God to bring my sunny day8Embed
