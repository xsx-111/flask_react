Artificial Red Lyrics
Artificial red
Smoke, poison consumed
In the house of ill repute
Is this the way I spend my days
In recovery of a fatal disease?

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

On a cloud of pink has turned to gray
And I'm alone again, yeah
Someone to hold against my own
Alone, untouched is what I crave

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Artificial red
Smoke, poison consumed
In the house of ill repute
Is this the place I search for love
When my need is within me, a gift from above?
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh2Embed
