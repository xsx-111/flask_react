Mona LyricsHey, Mona, hey hey hey hey, Mona
I'm gonna build my house next door to you
I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
Maybe we could do a little kissing and tellin' lies
When I come out on the front, girl
You'll listen to my heart goin' bumpity bump
I need you baby and it ain't no lie
Without your lovin' I'll surely die
Hey, Mona, hey hey hey hey, Mona
Hey Mona
I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
Build my house next door to you
Can I make love to you once in a while?
Maybe we could do a little kissing and tellin' lies
When I come out on the front, girl
You'll listen to my heart goin' bumpity bump
I need you baby and it ain't no lie
Without you lovin' I'll surely die
Hey, Mona, hey hey hey hey, Mona
Hey MonaEmbed
