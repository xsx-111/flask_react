This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You) Lyrics
Ooh, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going

But I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes, I do (Yes, I do)

These old arms of mine miss having you around
Makes these tears inside start pouring down

Always with half a kiss, you remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start grinnin'
'Cause my head starts spinnin'
'Cause I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do

Ooh, I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day, gone for the week now

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
Tell the world about it

'Cause I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you (Darling, I'm)
I love you (Weak for you)
This old heart (Darling, I'm), darling, is weak for you (Mad about you)
(Darling, I'm) I love you (Weak for you)
Yes, I do (Darling, I'm), yes, I do (Mad about you)
(Darling, I'm) I love you (Weak for you)
Yes, I do (Darling, I'm), darling (Mad about you)1Embed
