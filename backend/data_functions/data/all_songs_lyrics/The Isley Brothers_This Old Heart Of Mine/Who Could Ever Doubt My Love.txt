Who Could Ever Doubt My Love LyricsWho could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?
Ooh, I've been falsely accused
Of being untrue to him
And it's not so
But it's the way she misjudged me
That really hurts, hurts me so
When I've been nothing but good to you
Forsaking all others
Giving my love to you
Who could ever doubt my love?
A victim of circumstance I have been
But what really hurts is
Instead of believing me
She believed her friends
When I've been nothing but good to you
Rearrange my life to please only you
Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?
Ooh, I've been cast aside
Because she believed someone elses lies
After I've done the best I could
Still I've been so misunderstood
After I've been good to you
So good, so good to you
Who could ever doubt my love?
Tell me
Who could ever doubt my love?
I wanna know
Who could ever doubt my love?
Please tell me
