Nowhere to Run LyricsNowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
It's not love, I'm running from
It's the heartaches, I know will come
'Cause I know, you're no good for me
But you've become a part of me
Everywhere I go, your face I see
Every step I take, you take with me, yeah
Nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
I know you're no good for me, now
But free of you I'll never be, no
Each night as I sleep into my heart you creep
I wake up feeling sorry I met you, hoping soon that I'll forget you
When I look in the mirror and comb my hair
I see your face just a-smiling there
Nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
I know you're no good for me
But free of you, I'll never be
How can I fight a lover that's sugar sweet
When it's so deep, so deep, deep inside of me
My love reaches so high, you can't get over it
So wide, you can't get around, no
Nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
I know you're no good for me
But free of you I'll never be
Nowhere to run to, baby nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby nowhere to hide
Nowhere to runEmbed
