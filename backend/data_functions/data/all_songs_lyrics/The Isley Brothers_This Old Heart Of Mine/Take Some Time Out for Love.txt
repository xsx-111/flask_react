Take Some Time Out for Love Lyrics
If your baby lives away across town
(Away across town)
And the hustle and bustle of life
Keeps getting you down
(Keeps getting you down)

Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Ahhh take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Yeah no matter what you're doing, yeah yeah
Take some time out for love
Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!

If your hands are tied
And you just can't get them free (get them free)
'Cause your old folks boss
Won't show you no sympathy (show you no sympathy)

Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Ahhh take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Yeah no matter what you're doing, yeah yeah
Take some time out for love
Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!
Baby I want you
(Take some time out)
Baby I want you
Baby I need you
Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!

Now you know your baby loves you
You don't have to worry
(You don't have to worry)
Just dial the telephone
And baby come running in a hurry
(Come running in a hurry)

Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Ahhh take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Yeah no matter what you're doing, yeah yeah
Take some time out for love
Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!
Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Ahhh take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Yeah no matter what you're doing, yeah yeah
Take some time out for love
Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!
Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)Embed
