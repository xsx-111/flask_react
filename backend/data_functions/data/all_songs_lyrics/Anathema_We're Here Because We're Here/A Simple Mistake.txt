A Simple Mistake Lyrics
Think for yourself, you know what you need in this life
See for yourself and feel your soul come alive tonight
Here in moments we share, trembling between the worlds we stare
Out at starlight enshrined, veiled like diamonds in

Time could be the answer, take a chance or lose it all
It's a simple mistake to make, to create love and to fall
So rise and be your master, 'cause you don't need to be a slave
Of memory ensnared in a web, in a cage

I've found my way to fly, free from constraints of time
I have soared through the sky, seen life far below in mind
Breathed in truth, love, serene, sailed on oceans of belief
Searched and found life inside, we're not just a moment in

Time could be the answer
(Feel renewed inside, feel the truth in life )
Take a chance or lose it all
(See beyond the sky, beyond our waking eyes )
It's a simple mistake to make
(And when the night is long, feel I don't belong)
To creatve love and to fall
(And when the sky is grey, you turn to me and say)
So rise and be your master
("Love is all we are, together or apart")
'Cause you don't need to be a slave
(And then the light of day calls you on your way)
Of memory, ensnared
(Feel renewed inside, feel the truth in life)
In a web, in a cage
(See beyond, see beyond)
In a web, in a cage
(See beyond, see beyond)
In a web, in a cage
(See beyond, see beyond)
In a web, in a cage
(See beyond, see beyond)


It's never too late, it's never too late!
It's never too late, It's never too late!
It's never too late, It's never too late!
It's never too late, It's never too late

Itâ€™s starting to rain2Embed
