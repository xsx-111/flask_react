Everything (demo mix) LyricsNeeded time to clear my mind
Breathe the free air find some peace there
I used to keep my heart in jail
But the choice was love or fear of pain and
And I chose love
Because everything is energy and energy is you and me
Everything is energy in you and me
Light shines in through an open window
Shines inside your heart and soul
And light will guide your way through time
And love will help you heal your mind
And life will be
Because everything is energy and energy is you and me
Everything is energy in you and me
Everything is energy in you and me
Everything is energyEmbed
