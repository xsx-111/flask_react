A Simple Mistake (demo mix) LyricsThink for yourself you know what you need in this life
See for yourself and feel your soul come alive tonight
Here in moments we share
Trembling between the worlds we stare
Out at starlight enshrined
Veiled like diamonds in time...
...could be the answer
Take a chance or lose it all
It's a simple mistake to make
To create love and to fall
So rise and be your master
Cause you don't need to be a slave
Of memory ensnared in a web, in a cage
I've found my way to fly
Free from the constraints of time
I have soared through the sky
Seen life far below in mind
Breathed in truth, love, serene
Sailed on oceans of belief
Searched and found life inside
We're not just a moment in time...
(Feel renewed inside)
...could be the answer
(Feel the truth in life)
Take a chance
(See beyond the sky)
Or lose it all
(Beyond our waking eyes)
It's a simple
(And when the night is long)
Mistake to make
(Feel I don't belong)
To create love
(And when the sky is grey)
And to fall
(You turn to me and say)
So rise
("Love is all we are")
And be your master
("Together or apart")
Cause you don't need
(And then the light of day)
To be a slave
(Calls you on your way)
Of memory
(Feel renewed inside)
Ensnared
(Feel the truth in life)
In a web
(See beyond)
In a cage
(See beyond)
In a web
(See beyond)
In a cage
(See beyond)
In a web
(See beyond)
In a cage
(See beyond)
In a web
(See beyond)
In a cage
(See beyond)
...It's never too late!Embed
