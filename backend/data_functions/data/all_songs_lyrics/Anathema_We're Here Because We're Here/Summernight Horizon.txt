Summernight Horizon LyricsIn the moonlight, in the moonlight's pale embrace
To know the space between us, the space between us
Dreamlight, dreamlight comes in waves
Starlight, starlight silent brace
To know the space within us, the space within us
In blood red skies, mind takes flight
Oceans rise, worlds collide
To know the space between us, the space between us

Fly in a dream so high
Feel so alive
The world is like a jewel in your eyes
One life, feel it


Fly in a dream so high
Feel so alive
The world is like a jewel in your eyes
One life, feel it
In the moonlight, the moonlight's pale embrace
There is no space between us, no space between us
In blood red skies tears run dry
There is no space between usEmbed
