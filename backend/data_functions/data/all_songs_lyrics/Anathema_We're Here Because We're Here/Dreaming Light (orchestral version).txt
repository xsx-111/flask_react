Dreaming Light (orchestral version) LyricsSuddenly
Life has new meaning
Suddenly
Feeling is being
And you shine inside
And love stills my mind
Like the sunrise
Dreaming light of the sunrise
And suddenly
I don't have to be afraid
Suddenly
It all falls into place
And you shine inside
And love stills my mind
Like the sunrise
Dreaming light of the sunrise
Dreaming light and you...shine inside
And love stills my mind
Like the sunrise
Dreaming light of the sunrise
I feel you but I don't really know you
I dreamed of you from the moment I saw you
And I've seen the sunrise in your eyes
The sky, the sea, the light
So live your dream beneath the northern horizon
Be at peace set your heart in flight again
For the light is truth
The light is youEmbed
