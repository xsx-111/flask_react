Hindsight LyricsIntangible. Eternal. Without beginning nor end. The nameless
Formless energy that permeates all living things. That sweeps
Through nature like a ripple in an ocean, sending cascades of
Timeless wonder through the air, on the song of a bird, the
Freshness of the morning air. A clear calling for our inner
Nature to awaken beyond our every day lives, and fears. Love
Is timeless, love is purity. It is the lightless light, the
Rays of the sunrise dancing on the surface of the sea. Love is
You, and love is me. It is the deepest knowing, the serenity of
Being, the laughter of the earth, the limitless breath of the
Wind, the wonder of potential, the power of thought, the gift
Of life, the highest vibration, the most profound awareness...
The knower. Life. Love. Infinite. within you. Now. Always
For it is in love's gentle embrace that we come to know the
Space between us. A feeling deep within that not all is what it
Seems. that we bear witness to a magic as deep our own, to a
Summernight horizon that whispers "welcome" to your soul. And
In those fleeting, trembling moments that we share between the
Worlds, it is enough for us to know that in each other we must
Care, for alive and not alone are we the children of the world
Here to witness time and the unfolding miracle of the soul
There is no difficulty that enough love will not conquer. There is
No disease that enough love cannot heal, No door that enough love
Will not open, No gulf that enough love will not bridge, and no
War that enough love will not throw down. It makes no difference
How deeply seated may be the trouble, how hopeless the outcome, how
Muddled the tangle, how great the mistake. A sufficient realization
Of love will dissolve it all. And if you could love enough, you
Would be the happiest and most powerful person in the worldEmbed
