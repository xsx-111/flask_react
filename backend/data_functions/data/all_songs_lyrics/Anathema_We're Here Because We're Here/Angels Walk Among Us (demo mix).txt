Angels Walk Among Us (demo mix) LyricsOnly you can heal your life
Only you can heal inside
But it must have been an angel
Who counted out the time
Yes it must have been an angel
Who raised a knowing smile
And I just couldn't reach you
No matter how I tried
I just couldn't reach you
So instead I ran to hide
Only you can heal your life
Only you can heal inside
Mother can you hear me?
Can you tell me, are you there?
Father can you help me?
Because I know that you care
And I don't have to fight it anymore
From all those years we were dreaming
And I don't have to worry anymore
Cause I found my belief in
Mother can you hear me?
Can you tell me are you there?
Father can you help me?
Cause I know that you care
Only you can heal your life
Only you can heal insideEmbed
