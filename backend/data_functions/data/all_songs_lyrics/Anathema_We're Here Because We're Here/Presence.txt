"One has to come to terms with one's own mortality
You know, you can't really help people who are having problems with mortality if you've got problems of your own
So you have to begin to sort things out
And I thought I had sorted things out until I saw this little excerpt from this book which said, as far as I can remember:
'Life is not the opposite of death
Death is the opposite of birth, life is eternal.'
And I thought that it's the most profound words I'd ever heard about that issue and it really put me in peace
I felt this wonderful stillness... and I thought 'That's it!' what else is there to say?
Life is eternal, so the opposite of life is not death, but life is eternal, it has no opposite
So, what happens there is...
I suppose one just remains in a state of pure consciousness
Stillness, silence, you know, what we're looking for now, we're searching for it, or we have been searching for it, and now we have come closer to it
And it's knowing that it's already there, there's nothing to look for, nothing to seek, it's there
And it's going to be there all the time, forevermore."

Only you can heal your life
Only you can heal inside
