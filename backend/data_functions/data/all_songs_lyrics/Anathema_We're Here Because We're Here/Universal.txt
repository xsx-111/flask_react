Universal LyricsAbove the clouds, we flew to heaven
Through the eye of the storm into, to the light
I see you
You're everywhere I go, it's in everything I do
I dreamed a thousand years
Just to be here, where everything is right
Scrape those screaming skies
Defy the limits and fly high
I see you
You're everywhere I go, it's in everything I do
I see you
You're everywhere I go, it's in everything I doEmbed
