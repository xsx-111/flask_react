Above the clouds
We flew to heaven
Through the eye of the storm
Into the light
And I see you
You're everywhere I go
And it's in everything I do
I dreamed a thousand years
Just to be here
Where everything is right
Scrape those screaming skies
Defy the limits and fly high
And I see you
You're everywhere I go
And it's in everything I do
And I see you
You're everywhere I go
And it's in everything I doEmbed
