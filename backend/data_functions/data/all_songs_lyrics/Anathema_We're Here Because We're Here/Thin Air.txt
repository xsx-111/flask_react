Thin Air LyricsLove is free
In time, in peace
And now is here
This life, this dream
You know how it feels but is it all in your mind?
When you know how it feels to be pushed and pulled through your life
And sometimes it seems like there is life in your eyes
And all that I know is I love you, yes, I love you
And it feels like we're already flying
But the air is too thin and we're dying
The clouds all around take us higher
The world far below is on fire
I hold out my hand just to touch you
And all that I know is I love you
A vision a promise of heaven
A reason for being forever
You're just a whisper away
We've come too far to turn back
This is where we stand and face it
This is who we are, one step closer
Into thin air we will go there
We've come too far to turn back
This is where we stand and face it
I feel you breathe
You're just a whisper away
We've come too far to turn back
This is where we stand and face it
This is who we are, one step closer
Into thin air we will go there
We've come too far to turn back
This is where we standEmbed
