Get Off Get Out LyricsGet off, get out, get off, get out
Get off, get out, get off, get out
Get off, get out, get off, get out
Get off, get out, get off, get out
Get off, get out, get off, get out
Get off, get out, get off, get out
Get off, get out, get off, get out
Get off, get out, get off, get out
I know I feel it flow
I see it grow, I see you low
Hello, too low, hello, too low
Hello, too low, hello, how low
I know to feel it more, to feel it more, feel it more
Than more, than more
I feel it more to feel it more
It ain't about yourself get out of yourself
Push it on out of yourself right out of sight
You got a big surprise coming your way
Push it on all out, move it, push it, push it, push it, push it
It ain't about yourself get out of yourself
Go check it out, it's coming, coming, coming, coming, coming
It ain't about yourself get out of yourself
Push it on out of yourself right out of sight
You got a big surprise coming your way
Push it on all out, move it, push it, push it, push it, push it
It ain't about yourself get out of yourself
Go check it out, it's coming, coming, coming, coming, coming
It ain't about yourself get out of yourself
Go check it out, it's coming, coming, coming, coming, coming
It ain't about yourself get out of yourself
Push it on out of yourself right out of sight
You got a big surprise coming your way
Go check it out, it's coming, coming, coming, coming, comingEmbed
