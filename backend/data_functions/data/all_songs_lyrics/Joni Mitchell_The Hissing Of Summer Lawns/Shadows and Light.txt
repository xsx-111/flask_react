Shadows and Light Lyrics
Every picture has its shadows and it has some source of light
Blindness, blindness and sight
The perils of benefactors, the blessings of parasites
Blindness, blindness and sight

Threatened by all things, devil of cruelty
Drawn to all things, devil of delight
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws
Governing blindness, blindness and sight

Suntans in reservation dining rooms, pale miners in their lantern rays
Night, night and day
Hostage smiles on presidents, freedom scribbled in the subway
It's like night, night and day

Threatened by all things, god of cruelty
Drawn to all things, god of delight
Mythical god of the everlasting laws
Governing day, day and night

Critics of all expression, judges in black and white
Saying it's wrong, saying it's right
Compelled by prescribed standards or some ideals we fight
For wrong, wrong and right
Threatened by all things, man of cruelty, mark of Cain
Drawn to all things, man of delight born again, born again
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Wrong and rightEmbed
