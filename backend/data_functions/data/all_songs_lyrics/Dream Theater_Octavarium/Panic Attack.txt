Panic Attack Lyrics
All wound up, on the edge, terrified
Sleep disturbed, restless mind, petrified
Bouts of fear permeate all I see
Heightening nervousness threatens me

I am paralyzed
So afraid to die

Caught off guard, warning signs never show
Tension strikes, choking me, worries grow

Why do I feel so numb?
Is it something to do with where I come from?
Should this be fight or flight?
I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight

Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest
Agitated body in distress
I feel like I'm in danger
Daily life is strangled by my stress
A stifling surge shooting through all my veins
Extreme apprehension, suddenly I'm insane
Lost all hope for redemption
A grave situation desperate at best
Why do I feel so numb?
Is it something to do with where I come from?
Should this be fight or flight?
I don't know why I'm constantly reeling

Helpless hysteria
A false sense of urgency
Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety
Run, try to hide
Overwhelmed by this complex delirium

Helpless hysteria
A false sense of urgency
Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety
Run, try to hide
Overwhelmed by this complex delirium6Embed
