Octavarium Lyrics

I never wanted to become someone like him, so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that this was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd never be someone like him!
So many years have passed since I proclaimed
My independence, my mission
My aim and my vision, so secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know that I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm missing out this time
As far as I could tell, there's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself, could this be everything?
Then all I swore, that I would never be was now
So suddenly, the only thing, I wanted to become
To be someone just like him

A doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep
For 30 years, where have I been?
Eyes open, but not getting through to me
Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear as my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast, can't you stop what's happening?
A higher dosage he prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot, a brief awakening
I feel the relapse, can't break free
Eyes open, but not getting through to me
Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear, as my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast, can't you stop what's happening?


Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem's ready
Jack the ripper Owens Wilson Phillips and my supper's ready
Lucy in the sky with diamond Dave's not here I come to save the
Day for nightmare cinema show me the way to get back home again
(Running forward, falling back) Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in) Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up) Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to) Find I've come full circle
Flying off the handle be careful with
That axe Eugene gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey my my generation's home again
(Running forward, falling back) Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in) Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up) Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to) Find I've come full circle


Root, our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path
Second, asking questions, search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you
Third, try to break through, long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath
Fourth, loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire
Fifth, tortured Insanity, a smothering hell
Try to escape but no avail
Sixth, the calls of admirers who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more
Seventh, innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs
Octave, step after step, we try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge
A perfect sphere colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began!
