Never Enough Lyrics
Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away?
Would you appreciate?
But then it'd be too late!
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

Sacrifice my life
Neglect my kids and wife
All for you to be happy!
All those sleepless nights
And countless fights to give you more
And then you say how dare that
I didn't write you back
I must be too good for you
I only care about myself
What would you say
If I walked away?
Would you appreciate?
But then it'd be too late!
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough


What would you say
If I walked away?
Would you appreciate?
But then it'd be too late!
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough!3Embed
