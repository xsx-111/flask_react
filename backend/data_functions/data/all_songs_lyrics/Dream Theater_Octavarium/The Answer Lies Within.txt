The Answer Lies Within Lyrics
Look around
Where do you belong?
Don't be afraid
You are not the only one

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by in doubt
The answer lies within

Life is short, so learn from your mistakes
And stand behind the choices that you made
Face each day with both eyes open wide
And try to give, don't keep it all inside

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by, in doubt
The answer lies within

You've got the future on your side
You're gonna be fine now
I know whatever you decide
You're gonna shine!
Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by, in doubt
You're ready to begin

Don't let a day go by in doubt
The answer lies withinEmbed
