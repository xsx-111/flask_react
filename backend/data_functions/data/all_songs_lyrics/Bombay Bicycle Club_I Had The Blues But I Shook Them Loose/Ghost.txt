Ghost Lyrics
Chasing the dream, no I never pick up the pen
Always assured but I like it when we pretend
You should be around, they should just say when
You should make time; you should make time for them

My ever-changing ghost
I think he loves them the most
He always shows you where and how and when you went wrong

Always planned but never get things done
I walk in the room and see you waltzing around
The love that you give is such a familiar sound
You just fly straight up and calm the fuck down
You see a house fall because you built it on the wrong ground

My ever-changing ghost
I think he loves them the most
The most
He always shows youEmbed
