Always Like This Lyrics
Oh, she can wait
For what I can give
She knows what I am but
She won’t believe me
Is it all okay?
Will I come off the lightest?
I can’t believe it
It’s always like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this)
Kept it at bay
Yes, you kept your words
There on your mouth
But it’s not what I heard
If I follow the light
That I deem the brightest
I won’t believe that
It’s always like this

(No, no, no...)
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I'm not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
But I'm not gone
Oh, you can wait
For what I can give
You know what I am
So you know how I live
Try to look proud
But you’re not in the slightest
It's happening now
And it’s always been like this
(Like this, like this, like this...)

I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
But I'm not gone14Embed
