Cancel On Me Lyrics
Cancel on me again
Oh, cancel on me again
And it's not your fault and again
No it's not your fault you said
Oh

All the world has come to see the end
And you will never see this place again
And all the world has come to see the end
And you will never see my face again

No it's not your fault and again
No it's not your fault you said
So cancel on me again
Oh, cancel on me again
Oh

All the world has come to see the end
And you will never see this place again
And all the world has come to see the end
And you will never see my face again
All the world has come to see the end
And you will never see this place again
And all the world has come to see the end
And you will never see my face again

I'm dreaming of you pushing up to me
And I know where it's going to lead
Dreaming of you rushing up to me
And you know where it's where you want to be
Dreaming of you pushing up to me
And I know where it's going to lead
Dreaming of you rushing up to me
That was the boy I used to be

Yeah, I'm dreaming of you rushing
I'm dreaming of you rushing
I'm dreaming of you rushing up to me1Embed
