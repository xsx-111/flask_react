Evening / Morning Lyrics
Always adrift--there are trips to make
The night won't break, if the day won't break
When I was out, did you get in?
Did you draw the right stuff on your skin?
Say:

I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything
(x2)
Oh, we can, we can, we can (Oo-oo-oo-oo)
Oh, we can, we can, we can (Oo-oo-oo-oo)
(we can) Oh, we can, we can, we can (Oo-oo-oo-oo)
(we can) Oh, we can, we can, we can (Oo-oo-oo-oo)

Keep with me, I hope you'll see that
We can speak at slower speeds
When I wake up it will always be that
When I wake up it will always be that
I am ready to
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything

And that's the way to work it out
And that's the way to work it out
And that's the way to work it out
And that's the way to work it out7Embed
