Autumn Lyrics
And every time I walk away from you
There's never time
To say what I really had in mind

And people try, they never know what's right
It's all the same
A different life behind every face
But I can't change
I've seen a different page
It's in my head
And I can't turn my back

And every word I try to say to you
I never say at the right time
In the right way
And every feeling waiting to escape
And suffocate
Every night and every day

People try, they never know what's right
It's all the same
A different life behind every face
Well I can't change
I've seen a different pain
It's in my head
And I won't turn my backEmbed
