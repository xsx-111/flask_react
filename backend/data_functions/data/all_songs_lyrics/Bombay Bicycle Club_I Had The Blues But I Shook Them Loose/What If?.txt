What If? Lyrics
I could go and ask her first
You could try but it won't work
I don't want my cover blown
I should do this on my own

The night has gone
And I'm walking home
But I still don't
I still don't know

If only
One of us
Had the guts tonight

It's so hard to find the silent type
Someone shy who won't spread the hype
You're so cold and you're in this crowd
I am on my way now
