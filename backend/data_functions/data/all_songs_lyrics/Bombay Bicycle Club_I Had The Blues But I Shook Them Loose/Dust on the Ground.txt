Dust on the Ground LyricsIt's that ancient love
That you won't outgrow
It's the fee you pay
It's the debt you owe
It's that subtle way
That you throw me down
And I'm inches above
The dust on the ground
And I await your call
I await your crown
So let's change our roads
And twist the mould around
It's that subtle way
You throw me down
And I'm inches above
The dust on the ground
And always quiet
Always quiet now
And always silent
Always silent now
No I don't hide it
I don't hide it now
It's that ancient love
That just moves along
And there's an itch so slight
Even when you're gone
Well I met you right
But I kept you wrong
And I must wait until I've found the ground that you are walking on
And always quiet
Always quiet now
And always silent
Always silent now
No I don't hide it
I don't hide it now
No I don't hide it
I don't hide it now2Embed
