Magnet Lyrics
Now it's decision time
Which one will stay which one will say goodbye
And just my luck to find
Someone that makes me want to leave her behind

We took the backseat, everyone was happy
We took the back where everybody left
We took the backseat, everyone was happy

Now it's decision time
Which one will stay which one will say goodbye
And I've woken up in so many rooms
I'm sorry that I left so soon, I
Didn't want to break anybody's mood
'Cause last night you woke me up
We almost fell in love
But then you said
It is time for bed, uh-oh

We took the backseat, everyone was happy
We took the back where everybody left
We took the backseat, everyone was happyEmbed
