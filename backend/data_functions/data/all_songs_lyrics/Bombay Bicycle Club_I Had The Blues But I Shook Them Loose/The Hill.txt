The Hill Lyrics
When we look at the Summer Sun, yellow and round
So we go out to the hill and we lie down
All but one sits in the corner
Trying to find a way

And alright let's go outside
And rise, rise, rise to the meaning of life
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times

And looking back, looking out at different things
We flew too high; let the Sun burn our wings
We never thought it would be us
Let it all come fast, turn to dust

And alright let's go outside
And rise, rise, rise to the meaning of life
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times
And alright let's go outside
And rise, rise, rise to the meaning of life
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times
And alright let's go outside
And rise, rise, rise to the meaning of life
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times
And alright let's go outside
Rise, rise, rise to the meaning of life
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old timesEmbed
