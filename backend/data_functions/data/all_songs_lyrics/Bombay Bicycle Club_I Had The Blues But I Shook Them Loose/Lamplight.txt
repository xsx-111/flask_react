Lamplight Lyrics
You mirror gaze while I decide
The moment you were deified
You turn as if your mind replies
If your devout is insurmountable

These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind

Never really put me right
The words we said by dim lamplight
Bodies cold and intertwined
I feel the spirit, I feel the

These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind
These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind

These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind2Embed
