The Giantess Lyrics
Once is better than a lifetime
Once is better than a whole long side
When you catch in the humble life
He can get it in the after
He can hold it in the molar while
When the back of her gets so damn worked over

Where's the lightning? Where's the lightning?
Where's the lightning now?
Wear your fingers, wear your fingers
Wear your fingers now
He can taste it, he can taste it
He can taste it now
Come and get it, come and get it
Come and get it now

Once is better than a lifetime
Once is better than a whole long side
When you catch it in the humble life
He can get it in the after
He can hold it in the molar while
When the back of her gets so damn worked over
Thinking what he'll ask her then
Oh this misery come when
Sitting on a silver throne
Waiting up but you're not home

Where's the lightning? Where's the lightning?
Where's the lightning now?
Wear your fingers, wear your fingers
Wear your fingers now
He can taste it, he can taste it
He can taste it now
Come and get it, come and get it
Come and get it nowEmbed
