Cloak a Dagger (Version 3) Lyrics
Now, idrens and daughters
I now present to you episode three of "Cloak an' Dagger"
Music to make you stagger
So, don't be like John Dollar who sold the dollar (Right on!)

Good gosh!
Spread out and scatter
Music gettin' hotter
Skank on wall
For, King Tubby's at the control
Dub it, rub it (Right on!)
Scrub it like you  rub it
And you can also dub it like you love it

King Tubby's are no missah
Tubby's are di dub organiser
King Tubby's make you wiser
Tubby's are di dub compromiser

Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
I-ya, I-ya, I-ya, I-ya, I-ya
I-ya, I-ya
I-ya, I-ya, I-ya, I-ya, I-ya
Do it to me!
Skank it!
Goodness gracious, I tell you

So, mister Tubby make you rub it
Cah, mister Tubby make you dub it

Do it, screw it! (Good gosh!)
Right on!
Spread out and scatter
Music gettin' hotter
Rock an' roll, like you never do before
For, King Tubby's at the control (Good gosh!)
I'm the upsetter, but not the distresser, you know (Right on!)

I-ya, I-ya, I-ya, I-ya, I-ya
I-ya, I-ya
I-ya, I-ya, I-ya, I-ya, I-yaEmbed
