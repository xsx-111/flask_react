I Want to Be on T.V. Lyrics
Wanna be a pretty boy
Wanna go on Solid Gold
Wanna date a millionaire
Wanna make people stare

I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TV

Studio 54
Gonna be out on the floor
Wanna make people dance
Gonna take off my pants

I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TV

Gonna wanna make a scene
Gonna get some free cocaine
Wanna wear my Calvin Klein's
Emmy Award will be all mine
I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TV2Embed
