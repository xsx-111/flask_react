Armatage Shanks Lyrics
Fffff...

Stranded, lost inside myself
My own worst friend and my own closest enemy
I'm branded, maladjusted
Never trusted anyone, let alone myself

I must insist on being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Elected, the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot
No meaning and no healing
Self-loathing freak, an introverted deviant

I must insist on being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Say whatever, oh-oh, woah-oh
Say whatever, oh-oh, woah-oh
Shoot!
Stranded, lost inside myself
My own worst friend and my own closest enemy
Elected, the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot

I must insist on being the pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind
I'm gettin' pissed, I'm a worthless pessimist
I'm a loner in a claustrophobic mind2Embed
