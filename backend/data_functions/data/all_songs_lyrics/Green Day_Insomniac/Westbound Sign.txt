Westbound Sign Lyrics
Boxed up all of her favorite things
Sold the rest at a rainy yard sale
Big plans and leaving friends and a westbound sign
Weighed out her choices on a scale
Prevailing nothing made sense
Just transportation and a blank decision

She's taking off
Taking off
Taking off
Taking off

No time and no copping out
She's burning daylight and petrol
Blacked out the rearview mirror heading westward on
Strung out on a confusion road
And ten-minute nervous breakdowns
Xanax, a beer for thought, and she's determined

She's taking off
Taking off
Taking off
Taking off
Oh, is this salvation?
Or an escape from discontent?
Will she find her name
In the California cement?
Punched out of the grind
That punched her one too many times
Is tragedy 2000 miles away?
She's taking off...

Alright!1Embed
