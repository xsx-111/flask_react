Stuck with Me Lyrics
I'm not part of your elite, I'm just alright
Class structures waving, colors bleeding from my throat
Not subservient to you, I'm just alright
Down-classed by the powers that be, give me loss of hope

Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well, I know I'm not alright

What's my price, and will you pay it if it's alright?
Take it from my dignity and waste it 'til it's dead
Throw me back into the gutter 'cause it's alright
Find another pleasure-fucker, drag them down to hell

Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well, I know I'm not alright

One, two, three, four!
Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well, I know I'm not alright4Embed
