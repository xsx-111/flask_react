No Pride Lyrics
Well I am just a mutt, and nowhere is my home
Where dignity's a land mine in the school of lost hope
I've panhandled for life 'cause I'm not afraid to beg
Hand me down your lost and founds of second hand regret

You better swallow your pride, or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values, 'cause they turn to shit

Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
Well, I know I'm not the one, I got no pride

Well, sects of disconnection and traditions of lost faith
No culture's worth a stream of piss or a bullet in my face
To hell with unity, separation'll kill us all
Torn to shreds and disjointed before the final fall

You better swallow your pride, or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values, 'cause they turn to shit

Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
Well, I know I'm not the one, I got no pride
Shuh!
You better swallow your pride, or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values, 'cause they turn to shit

Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
Well, I know I'm not the one, I got no pride

I got no pride
Close your eyes and die
I got no pride3Embed
