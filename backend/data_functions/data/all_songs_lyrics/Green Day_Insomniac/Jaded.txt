Jaded Lyrics
Somebody keep my balance, I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression
The expiration date rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank

Always move forward
Going straight won't get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways, leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium
Count down from 9 to 5, hooray, we're gonna die
Blessed into our distinction

Always move forward
Going straight won't get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

Always move forward
Going straight won't get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
In nowhere, in nowhere9Embed
