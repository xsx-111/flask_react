Arrival in Nara Lyrics

As she submarines, the rope loops 'round her feeble feet
Before the dawn breaks on her sorry grasp
In a blink and in one motion
Rope constricts, rips her towards the ocean
She never finds her bearings
Sucking splash into her lungs

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Though I cannot see, I can hear
Her smile as she sings
And though I cannot see, I can hear
Her smile as she sings
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh27Embed
