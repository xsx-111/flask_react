Left Hand Free Lyrics
Ain't shady, baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal: eeny, meeny, miny, moe
And flower, you're the chosen one

Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no

I tackle, we tussle
And oh my days, we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his
Colt single-action army
Oh, no

Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz, girl, you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
Oh my days, he disagrees
Oh, no
(Speak easy)

Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Oh, no

Hey shady, baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal: eeny, meeny, miny, moe
And flower, you're the chosen one

Well, your left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Oh, no88Embed
