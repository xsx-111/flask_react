Lovely Day Lyrics
On the night line
(On the night line)

When I wake up in the morning light
Sunlight hurts my eyes
Something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind
Then I look at you
Then I look at you
Then I look at you
Then I look at you

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Oh, just one look at you
Just one look at you
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be a lovely day
For the night line
For the night line

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Oh, just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be a lovely day
On the night line
For the night line

On the night line
On the night line
On the night line9Embed
