Hobo Chang Ba Lyrics
Straw wood claw rattlin' my jaw
I can't call it usin'
It's just somethin' soothin'
Feather times, a feather
Mornin' time to thaw

Hobo Chang Ba
Hobo Chang Ba

Standin' still is losin'
Feather times a feather
Mornin' time to thaw
Straw wood claw rattlin' my jaw

Hobo Chang Ba
Hobo Chang Ba
Hobo Chang Ba, oh
Hobo Chang Ba, oh

Stand to gain my ground
Lay to rest the law
The ocean is my mother
The freight train is my paw
Hobo Chang Ba
Hobo Chang Ba, oh
Hobo Chang Ba

The rails I ride are rustin'
The new sunrise I'm trustin'
The rails I ride are rustin'
The new sunrise I'm trustin'
Straw wood claw rattlin' my jaw

Hobo Chang Ba, ooh
Hobo Chang Ba
