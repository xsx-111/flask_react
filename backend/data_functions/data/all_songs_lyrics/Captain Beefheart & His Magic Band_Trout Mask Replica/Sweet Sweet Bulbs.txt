Sweet Sweet Bulbs Lyrics
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, bulbs grow
In my ladies' garden
Warm, warm, warm, warm, warm sun-fingers wave
In my ladies' garden
Flowers dance, their faces brave
Come talk freely in the garden of my lady
Her hominy smile, her hominy snatch
Only a crow would peck and a chicken would scratch

Her lips turned up to kiss
I see ya, Phoebe, baby, in your bonnet
With the sunset written on it
In the shadow of a tree curled around her knee in color
And just behind ya was the sea of negativity
Tinklin' like mercury in the wind
Her feet kept by the ground, her toes bare brown
Her carriage, she'd abandoned like a hand-me-down
She walked back into nature, a queen uncrowned
She had just recognized herself to be an heir to the throne

Her garden gate swings lightly without weight
Open to most anyone that needs a little freedom
For God's sake, oh, come as many as you can
In dark or light you're free to grow as flowers
Share her throne and use her toothbrush
And spend some interesting hoursEmbed
