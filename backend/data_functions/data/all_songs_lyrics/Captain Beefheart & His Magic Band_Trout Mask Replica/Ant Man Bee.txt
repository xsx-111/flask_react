Ant Man Bee Lyrics
White ants runnin'
Black ants crawlin'
Yella ants dreamin'
Brown ants longin'
All those people longin' to be free

Uhuru, ant man bee
Uhuru, ant man bee

All the ants in God's garden
They can't get along
War still runnin' on
It's that one lump sugar
That they won't leave each other 'lone

Why do you have to do this?
You've got to let us free
Why do you have to do this?
You've got to set us free
Why do you have to do this?
You've got to set us free
Why do you have to do this?
You've got to set us free
Uhuru, ant man bee
Uhuru, ant man bee

Now the bee takes his honey
Then he sets the flower free
But in God's garden only
Man and the ants
They won't set each other be
