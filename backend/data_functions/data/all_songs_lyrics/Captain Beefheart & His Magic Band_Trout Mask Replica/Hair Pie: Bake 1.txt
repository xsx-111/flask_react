Hair Pie: Bake 1 Lyrics

We just moved in around here. We heard you play, so we decided we'd come up and find out who it was
Ahaha, Oh, ho, yes
Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band
Really?
Yeah
Where did you move here from?
Oh, just from-
-Reseda
Yeah
Reseda?
Yeah
She's nice
What do you think?
Sounds good
It's a bush recording
We're out recording the bush
Name of the composition is
"Me -, Neon Meate Dream of a Octafish"
Hum
Um
No, it's 'Hair Pie'
Looks you don't find the drummer now
HuhEmbed
