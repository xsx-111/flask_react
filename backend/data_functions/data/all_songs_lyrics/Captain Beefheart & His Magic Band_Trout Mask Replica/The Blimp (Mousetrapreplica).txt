The Blimp (Mousetrapreplica) Lyrics
You ready?
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Ok, go

Master, master
This is recorded through a fly's ear
And you have to have a fly's eye to see it
It's the thing that's gonna make Captain Beefheart
And His Magic Band fat
Frank, it's the big hit
It's the blimp, It's the blimp, Frank!
It's the blimp!
When I see you floatin' down the gutter
I'll give you a bottle of wine
Put me on the white hook
Back in the fat rack, Shadrach e-shack
The sumptin' hoop, the sumptin' hoop
The blimp, the blimp!
The drazy hoops, the drazy hoops!
They're camp, they're camp
Tits, tits, the blimp, the blimp
The mothership, the mothership
The brothers hid under the hood
From the blimp, the blimp
Children, stop your nursing unless you're rendering fun
The mothership, the mothership
The mothership's the one
The blimp, the blimp
The tape's a trip, it's a trailin' tail
It's traipse'n along behind
The blimp, the blimp
The nose has a crimp
The nose is the blimp, the blimp
It blows the air, the snoot isn't fair
Look up in the sky -- there's a dirigible there
The drazy hoops whir
You can see them just as they were
All the people stare
And the girls' knees tremble
And run and wave their hands
And run their hands over
The blimp, the blimp
"Daughter, don't you dare!"
"Oh momma, who cares?
It's the blimp, it's the blimp!"
(Hello)
Hello
(Did you get it?)
Sure did
It's beautiful
I think that we have enough on the tape to uh
Just use that as is for the album
Ok, I'm gonna listen to it back now I gotta go back to workEmbed
