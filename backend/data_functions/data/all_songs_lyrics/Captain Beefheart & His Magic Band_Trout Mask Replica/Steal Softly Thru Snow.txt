Steal Softly Thru Snow Lyrics
The black paper between a mirror breaks my heart
The moon frayed through dark velvet lightly apart

Steal softly through sunshine
Steal softly through snow

The wild goose flies from winter
Breaks my heart that I can't go
Energy flies through a field
And the sun softly melts a nothing wheel

Steal softly through sunshine
Steal softly through snow

The black paper between a mirror
Breaks my heart that I can't go
The swan their feathers don't grow, they're spun
They live two hundred years of love, they're one
Breaks my heart to see them cross the sun

Grain grows rainbows up straw hill
Breaks my heart to see the highway cross the hills
Man lived a million years and still he kills
The black paper between a mirror
Breaks my heart that I can't go
Steal softly through sunshine
Steal softly through snowEmbed
