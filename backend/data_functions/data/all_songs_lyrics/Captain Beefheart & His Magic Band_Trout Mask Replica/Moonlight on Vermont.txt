Moonlight on Vermont Lyrics
Moonlight on Vermont affected everybody
Even Mrs. Wooten well as Little Nitty
Even lifebuoy floating
With his lil' pistol showing
And his lil' pistol toting

Well that goes to show you what a moon can do

No more bridge from Tuesday to Friday
Everybody's gone, high society
Hope lost his head and got off on alligators
Somebodies leaving peanuts on the curbins
For a white elephant escaped from the zoo with love

Goes to show you what a moon can do
Moonlight on Vermont

Well it did it for Lifebuoy
And it did it to you
And it did it to zoo
And it can do it for me
And it can do it for you
Moonlight on Vermont

Give me that old time religion, give me that old time religion
Don't gimme no affliction, that old time religion
It's good enough for me
Ah, it's good enough for you
Well, come out to show them
Come out to show them, come out to show them
Come out to show them, come out to show them
Come out to show them, come out to show them
Give me that old time religion, give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion, it's good enough for me
Without your new affliction, don't need your new restrictions
Gimme that old time religion, it's good enough for me
