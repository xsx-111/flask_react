When Big Joan Sets Up Lyrics
Hoy, hoy!

When Big Joan comes out
Her arms are too small
Her head's like a ball
She's tied off her horse
And galloped off into the moonbeams
She pulled up her blouse
And compared her navel to the moon
I dig my life for a while


When Big Joan sets up
Her hands are too small
She's too fat to go out in the daylight
So she rolls around all night
I just saw the thread with a drooped body

I'll set up with ya, Big Joan
I'm too fat to go out in the daylight
I'll stay up all night
I won't droop if you won't talk
About your hands being too small
You know something's happening
Or you wouldn't of come out like you did
She ain't built for going naked
So she can't wear any new clothes
Or go to the beach
They laugh at her body
Cause her hands are too small

When big Joan sits up
Her hands are too small
She's outta reach
A turquoise scarf and silver
Rolled up over a Merc Montclair

I'll sit up with ya, Big Joan
I'm too fat to go out in the daytime
I'll stay up all night
If you promise not to talk
About your hands being too small

Hoy, hoy, is she a boy?
