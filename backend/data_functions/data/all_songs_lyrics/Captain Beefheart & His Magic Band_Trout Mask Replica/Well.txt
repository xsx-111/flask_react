Well Lyrics
Light floats down day river
On a red raft of blood
Night blocks out the heaven
Like a big, black, shiny bug
Its hard soft shell shining
White, in one spot, well
It's hard place, that I'm living but I'm doin' well, well

The white ice horse melted
Like a spot of silver, well
Its mane went last
Then disappeared the tail
My life ran through my veins
Whistlin' hollow, well
I froze in solid motion, well, well
I heard the ocean swarmin' body, well, well

I heard the beetle clickin', well
I sensed the thickest silence scream
Then I begin to dream
My mind cracked like custard
Ran red until it sealed
Turn to wooden and rolled like a wheel, well, well
Thick, black felt birds, are flying
With capes of solid chrome
With feathers of solid chrome
And beaks of solid bone
And bleached the air around them
White and cold well, well

Till it showed in pain
The hollow cane clicked
Like ever after
Its shadow vanished shinin' silence, well, wellEmbed
