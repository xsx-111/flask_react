Ella Guru Lyrics
Now, here she comes, walkin', lookin' like a zoo
(Hello, moon, hello, moon)
Hi, Ella, high Ella Guru
She knows all the colors that nature do
High Ella, high Ella Guru
High yella, high red, high blue, she blew
High Ella, high Ella Guru
She do what she mean and she do what she do
Got sumptin' fo' me, sumptin' for you
She sho' sumptin', she's young too

Ella Guru, Ella Guru
Ella Guru, Ella Guru

Ha, ha, right, right, just dig it
That's right, The Mascara Snake
Fast and bulbous, tight also

Ella Guru, Ella Guru
Ella Guru, Ella Guru
