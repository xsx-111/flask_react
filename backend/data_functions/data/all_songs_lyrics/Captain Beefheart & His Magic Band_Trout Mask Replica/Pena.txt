Pena Lyrics
Ahaha...
(Fast and bulbous!) Fast and bulbous!
That's... ahaha (Hey do it again, whenever you want)
I love that, I love those words
Fast and bulbous!
That's right, The Mascara Snake, fast and bulbous!
Bulbous also tapered?
Yeah but you've gotta wait until I say
"Also, a tin teardrop"
Oh... Christ, ahaha
(Again, beginning)
Fast and bulbous!
That's right, The Mascara Snake, fast and bulbous!
Also, a tin teardrop!
Bulbous also tapered?
That's right


Pena, her little head clinking
Like a barrel of red velvet balls full past noise
Treats filled her eyes
Turning them yellow like enamel-coated tacks
Soft like butter, hard not to pour
Out enjoying the sun
While sitting on a turned-on waffle iron
Smoke billowing up from between her legs
Made me vomit beautifully
And crush a chandelier
Fall on my stomach
And view her from a thousand happened faucets
Liquid red salt ran over crystals
I later band-aided the area
Sighed, oh well, it was worth it
Pena pleased, but sore
From sitting chose to stub her toe
And view the white pulps
Horribly large in their red pockets
"I'm tired of playing baby," she exclaimed
And out of a blue felt box
Let escape one yellow butterfly the same size
Its droppings were tiny green phosphorous worms
That moved in tuck and rolls
That clacked and whispered in their confinement
Three little burnt scotch taped windows several yards away
Mouths open to tongues that vibrated and lost saliva
Pena exclaimed, "That's the raspberries"
