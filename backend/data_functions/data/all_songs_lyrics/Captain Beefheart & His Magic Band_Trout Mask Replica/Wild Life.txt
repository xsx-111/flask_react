Wild Life Lyrics
Wild life along with my wife
I'm goin' up on the mountain
For the rest of my life
'Fore they take my life
'Fore they take my wild life
'Fore they take my wife

They got my mother's father
And run down all my kin
Folks I know I'm next

Wild life along with my wife
I'm goin' up on the mountain
For the rest of my life
'Fore they take my wild life
'Fore they take my wife, wife
'Fore they take my wife
Wild life, wild life, wild life
Wild life, wild life, wild life

I'm goin' up on the mountain along with my wife
Find me a cave and talk them bears, in takin' me in
Wild life along with m' wife, wild life
It's a man's best friend
Wild life along with my wife
I'm goin' up on the mountain
For the rest of my life
'Fore they take my life
'Fore they take my wild life
'Fore they take my wife
'Fore they take my wife
Wild life, wild life
Wild life, wild life

I'm goin' up on a mountain
Find me a cave and talk the bears, in takin' me in
Wild life is a man's best friend
Wild life, wild lifeEmbed
