Neon Meate Dream of a Octafish Lyrics
Lucid tentacles test and sleeved and joined
And jointed, jade pointed diamond back patterns
Neon meate dream of a octafish
Artifact on rose petals
And flesh petals in pots
Fact and feast, in tubes, tubs, bulbs
In jest, incest, in jest, in just, in feast, incest
And specks, and spreckled, spreckled
Speck-led speculation
Fedlocks waddlin' feast
Archaic faces frenzy
Ceramic fists, artificial deceased
In cysts, rancid buds burst
Dank drum and dung dust
Meate rose and hairs
Meaty meate rose and hairs
Meaty dream wet meat
Limp damp rows
Peeled and felt fields and belts
Impaled on in daemon
Mucus mules
Twat trot
Tra-la tra-la, tra-la tra-la tra-la
Whale bone fields 'n' belts
Whale bone farmhouse
Cavorts girdled in letters alight
Cavorts girdled in letters alight
A dipped amidst
Squirmin' serum in semen
In syrup in semen, in serum
Stirrupped in syrup
Neon meate dream of a octafish
