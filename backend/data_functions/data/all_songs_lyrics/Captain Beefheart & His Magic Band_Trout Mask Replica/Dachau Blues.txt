Dachau Blues Lyrics
Dachau blues, those poor Jews
Dachau blues, those poor Jews
Dachau blues, Dachau blues, those poor Jews
Still crying 'bout the burning back in World War Two's
One mad man, six million lose
Down in Dachau blues, down in Dachau blues

The world can't forget that misery
And the young ones now beggin' the old ones please
To stop bein' madmen
'Fore they have to tell their children
'Bout the burnings back in World War Three's

War One was balls an' powder an' blood an' snow
War Two rained death an' showers an' skeletons
Danced an' screaming an dying in the ovens
Cough an' smoke an' dying by the dozens

Down in Dachau blues
Down in Dachau blues

Three little children with doves on their shoulders
Their eyes rolled back in ecstasy
Crying, "Please, old man
Stop this misery"
They're countin' out the devil
With two fingers on their hands
Begging the Lord don't let the third one land
On World War Three, on World War Three
And it attracted a lot of rats, and er
They closed the doors, and er
They all got shotguns and shot in the grass
And nothing happened
They couldn't get the rats to move, see
So they got one fellow down there, and he said um
He-e-e-e- s-stammered at you;
When he got excited he couldn't talk at all, see
They got him down there and uh
Walt said, "I'll get them out of there"
And he took a stick and, beatin' them
Tryin to- tryin to get 'em out of there
Then they started to shoot in wild rushes
And old Walt thought he was gonna get killed2Embed
