My Human Gets Me Blues Lyrics
I saw you baby dancin' in your x-ray gingham dress
I knew you were under duress
I knew you were under your dress
Just keep comin', Jesus, you're the best dressed
You look dandy in the sky but you don't scare me
'Cause I got you here in my eye

In this lifetime
You got my human gets me blues

With your jaw hangin' slack and your
Hair's curlin'
Like an ole navy fork stickin' in the sunset
The way you were dancin' I knew you'd never come back
You were strainin' to keep your
Old black cracked patent shoes

In this lifetime
You got my human gets me blues

Well, the way you been, old lady I could see the
Fear in your windows
Under your furry crawlin' brow
A silver bow
Rings up in inches
You were afraid you'd be the devil's red wife
But it's all right, God dug your dance
And would have you young and in his harem
Dress you the way he wants cause he never had a doll
'Cause everybody made him a boy
And God didn't think to ask his preference
You can bring your dress and your favorite dog
And your husband's cane, and your old spotted hog
'Cause in this lifetime
You've got my human gets me blues3Embed
