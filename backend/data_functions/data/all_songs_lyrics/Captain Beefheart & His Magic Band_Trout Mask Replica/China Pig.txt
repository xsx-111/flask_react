China Pig Lyrics
I don't want to kill my China pig, no I don't

A man's gotta live
A man's gotta eat
A man's gotta have shoes
To walk out on the street

I don't want to kill my China pig
Ah, he was a baby, I want you to see
I don't want to kill my China pig

Well I used to go to school
With a little red box
And I used to have my pig go with me
We walked for blocks

I don't want to kill my China pig

His tail curls five times
In a circle 'round, ha
It's glazed
He's got a slot in his back
Flowers grow
My China pig be a
Quite a show
I don't wanna kill my China pig, oh no, ah

My China pig

I got him by the snout
And I takes him by the cuff
And I whipped out my fork
And I poked at him
Three hairs laid
Out on my floor
I remember my China pig

I fed the neighborhood
We lived in a big neighborhood
A lot of people liked my pig...
One little girl used to put her fingers in his snout
I put a fork in his back!

I didn't want to kill my China pigEmbed
