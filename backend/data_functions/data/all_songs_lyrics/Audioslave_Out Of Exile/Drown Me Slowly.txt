Drown Me Slowly Lyrics
I've got a will this time, I don't care what you say
I've got a feeling this will all go away
It's in the wind this time, it's in the southern sky
I can't walk on water yet won't even try

Drown me slowly, enclose me
Drown me slowly alright
Drown me slowly, enfold me
Drown me slowly

All that I took with me was a bad taste in my mouth
Went all around the world just couldn't spit it out
Just like ground zero was the surface of the sun
That's a sickness, I can't fix it, not all at once

Drown me slowly, enclose me
Drown me slowly alright
Drown me slowly, enfold me
Drown me slowly

Don't let them take you down
You'll leave a better world than you found
Don't let them take you down
You'll leave a better world than you found
Don't let them take you down
Don't let them take you down
Don't let them take you down
Don't let them take you down

Drown me slowly, enclose me
Drown me slowly alright
Drown me slowly, enfold me
Drown me slowly

Drown me slowlyEmbed
