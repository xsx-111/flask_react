The Worm Lyrics
Was a time early in life
When I hated everything
Born too young, top of my lungs
Sitting on the bottom rung
Took advice from the wrong shoulder
Took a lot of everything
But I've decided
To make it alright with my

Halo, I'm complete
Halo with me underneath
Halo, I'm reborn
I can do no wrong

Black and blue, suffering fools
By the age of seventeen
Low and high, just one more time
Felt like an eternity
Right or wrong, never too strong
Friends became my enemies
God forsaken
But never too late with my
Halo, I'm complete
Halo with me underneath
Halo, I'm reborn
I can do no wrong

You'll never change
You'll never change

Halo, I'm complete
Halo with me underneath
Halo, I'm reborn
I can do no wrong1Embed
