Man or Animal Lyrics
You give me a heart attack
You look like the summertime
You call me an artifact
But I'll save that for another time
I could be rich or poor
I don't need anymore
Keep your love inside the kitchen
You can feed me anything
Leave the feathers on the chicken
Peel the leather from your skin

I could be young or old
Sweet or sad, hot or cold

Man or animal, I don't care at all
Find the antidote underneath the dose
Man or animal, obedient, out of control

I will love you more than money
I will breathe you in the smoke
I will drink you in my honey
Sweet and golden down my throat
When you're right, when you're wrong
Head is near, eyes are gone
You can drown my appetite
I will sip your tears at night
You can tie me to a chair
Skin and bones, I don't care
I could be rich or poor
I don't need anymore

Man or animal, I don't care at all
Find the antidote underneath the dose
Man or animal, obedient, out of control
Hey!


Man or animal, I don't care at all
Find the antidote underneath the dose
Man or animal, obedient, out of control
Out of control!

You give me a heart attack
(You give me a heart attack)
I will give you more than that
(I will give you more than that)
You give me a heart attack
(You give me a heart attack)
I will give you more than that
(I will give you more than that)4Embed
