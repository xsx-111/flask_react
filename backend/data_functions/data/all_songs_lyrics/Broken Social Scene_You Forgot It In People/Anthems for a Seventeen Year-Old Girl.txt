Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl Lyrics
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Now you're all gone, got your makeup on and you're not coming back
Can't you come back?
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Now you're all gone, got your makeup on and you're not coming back

Bleaching your teeth, smiling flash, talking trash under your breath
Bleaching your teeth, smiling flash, talking trash under your breath
Bleaching your teeth, smiling flash, talking trash under your breath
Bleaching your teeth, smiling flash, talking trash under my window

Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone
Park that car, drop that phone
Park that car, drop that phone
Park that car, drop that phone
Park that car, drop that phone
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Now you're all gone, got your makeup on and you're not coming back13Embed
