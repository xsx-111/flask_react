Almost Crimes LyricsYou're like a messiah kid
Little kingdoms in your chest
I told you we'd make it, on for another
I told you we'd make it, on for all night (Put on all our best)
This is how they will live on
We'd looked better if we win
I told you we'd make it on for another (Oh I've been getting calls now out here)
I told you we'd make it on for more now (On their mouths and chest)
Help this love before you leave
Demonstrations lack caress
I want you to take you, call on for life (Thank you for creating souls...)
The longer we make this, got no way there (Children sleep with dicks)
The Yukon keeps me up all night
Complication sees your best
Told you, I want it here longer for you (I've been getting calls now out here)
I waited, I waited, it's late night, she's waiting at home (On their mouths and chest)
We've got love and hate it's the only way
We've got love and hate it's the only way
I think it's almost crime
I think it's almost crime
I think it's almost crime
I think it's almost timeEmbed
