Looks Just Like the Sun Lyrics
Looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
But it looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
But I'm breathing, thinking one

Heart is pounding in his chest
Reaches suddenly for his gun
Should be sailing in the West
Flower that could be his fun
(Keep going)
Tree of families on his head
Weary red, split open eyes
I'm on the corner, thinking about my bed
Isn't just in store and signifies
(One, two, three)

Looks just like
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
And it looks just like it
But it looks just like the sun
And it looks just like it
But I'm breathing, thinking one
(Here we go)
Gold and red, the colours change as you can't forget
Turning back, you know I thought I knew, thought I knew someone
You better check your watch
I think it's time you left
To he, and darkness, still it's obvious to everyone
Darkness, still, it's obvious to everyone
Still it's obvious to every

Well, it looks just like sun
Looks just like it (Looks just like it)
Looks just like the sun (Looks just like it)
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun (Looks just like it)
(Kevin, after this)
Looks just like it
(Here we go, Kev)
(Looks just like the sun) Looks just like the sun
