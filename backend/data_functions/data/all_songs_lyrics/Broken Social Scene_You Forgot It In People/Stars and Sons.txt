Stars and Sons Lyrics
Then when you let it
You asked for nothing
Why don't you share it?
All of the time you live
There's something out there
This one will know how far to live on
This one will ever know in this town
And in the red room at a distance
How would you know it?
You're the same when you're living
I don't know it, it won't be this

This one will know how far to live on
This one will know how far to live on

All of the time you wait, there's someone out there
And no one can find all the red
How would you show it?
You can see through the red
I don't know it, it won't be this time

This one will know how far to live on
This one will know how far to live onEmbed
