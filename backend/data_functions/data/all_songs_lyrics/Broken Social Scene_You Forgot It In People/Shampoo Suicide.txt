Shampoo Suicide Lyrics
All the lights we were
All the lights we were
All the lights we were
Do you remember

How they need something that's so hard
To come a time, some time we spent
(I cried for we when all was to come free
At the broken heart in the room)
Split your tongue down the semi kind
And show us lovers that don't love to live
Lick the kill that never knew
Eat the trees and then get off on time
Get us something with the finger kids
(I want it)
Put your teeth where you love to love
Drink some spit just to save your life
Bury parents in a moments time
Hate it all and you still use shampoo
You hate it all and you still use shampoo
Find some bullets in a backyard
Shoot them up with your favorite kid
Free them up like its another knife
Save them for when you thought you did
Seen the tricks all use shampoo
You hate it all
My daddy told me to get a life
Like the something of simple time
It tastes so good
I've seen your dreams and I wish you would
I've seen your choice and it don't taste so good
Sucks the jaws and they won't taste so good
I've seen your drugs and the don't look so good
Suck the jaws like I wish you would2Embed
