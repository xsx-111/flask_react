Cause = Time Lyrics
You come in, check my time
You've got fornication crimes
I've seen your hope on television
Where you've been, you were not were
They've got tricycles in skirts
This is a mouth that needs religion

And they all want to love the cause
Because they all need to be the cause
They all want to fuck the cause

So take me down, down through this
Kill the common law that missed
This is the blood I love to share
Little pistols and companion halls
Desperation tentacles
I've been alone since '89
We've got a menstruating disguise
They know the three completes the five
This is a church that should believe

And they all want to free the cause
Because they all need to dream a cause
They all need to be a cause
You've got all and it's
Pretty good, but I
Seem to be in disbelief
You come in, check my time
You've got fornication crimes
I've seen your death on television
Cue immortal childlike times
Separation is divine
Here is a strike beneath your knees

And they all want to love the cause
Because they all need to be the cause
They all want to fuck the cause

Take me down, down through this
Kill the white within the bliss
Here is a waiting room that wants to save your life

And they all want to love the cause
They all need to be the cause
They all want to dream a cause
They all need to fuck the cause2Embed
