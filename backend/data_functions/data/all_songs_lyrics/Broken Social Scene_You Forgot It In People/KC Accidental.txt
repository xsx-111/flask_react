KC Accidental Lyrics
All your kind, they're coming clean
They shut their eyes, they miss their scenes
All your kind, they spool and lance
They crash their kiss, they harmonize
All your kind, they're all your kind, they're
All your kind, they're coming clean
They sleep through keys, they kill their needs
It's goodEmbed
