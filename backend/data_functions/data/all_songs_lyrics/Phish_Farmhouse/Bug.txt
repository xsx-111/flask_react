Bug Lyrics
There’ve been times when i wonder
And times when i don’t
Concepts i’ll ponder
And concepts i won’t ever see
God isn’t one of these
Former or latter

Which did you think i meant?
It doesn’t matter to me
Bug — don’t need it
My thoughts faded
It doesn’t matter/overrated

Cold in my hand
In a country pool
Standing and waving
The rain, wind on the runway
Spending or saving
Credit or debt

Which did you think i meant?
Nothing i see can be taken from me
Bug — don’t need it
My thoughts faded
It doesn’t matter/overrated1Embed
