Heavy Things Lyrics
Things are falling down on me
Heavy things I could not see
When I finally came around
Something small would pin me down
When I tried
To step aside
I moved to where they’d hoped I’d be

Vanessa calls me on the phone
Reminding me I’m not alone
I fuss and quake and cavitate
I try to speak and turn to stone
Tilly reaches through my vest
To do the thing that she does best
She probes and tears my ventricles
And steals my one remaining breath

Things are falling down on me
Heavy things I could not see
When I finally came around
Something small would pin me down
When I tried
To step aside
I moved to where they’d hoped I’d be
Stumbling as I fall from grace
She needs my vision to replace
Her ailing sight throughout the night
Leaving two holes in my face
Mary was a friend I’d say
'Till one summer day
She borrowed everything I own
And then simply ran away

Things are falling down on me
Heavy things I could not see
When I finally came around
Something small would pin me down
When I tried
To step aside
I moved to where they’d hoped I’d be
Who-oh
Who-oh
Who-oh, who-oh
Things are falling down on me (who-oh)
Things are falling down on me (who-oh)
Things are falling down on me (who-oh, who-oh)
Things are falling down on me (who-oh)
Things are falling down on me (who-oh)
Things are falling down on me (who-oh, who-oh)Embed
