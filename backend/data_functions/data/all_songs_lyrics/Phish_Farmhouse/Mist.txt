Mist LyricsSeveral times unconsciously I've stumbled on the path
And seen a mountain in the mist
Rain falls on my shoulders, sun rises in the east
I'm worn and bruised but I am here at least
I guess I'm just an obstacle a thing to overcome
If I can sneak around myself again I'll know I've won
The moment seems to hand and float before me with no end
'til I'm released awaken beasts I'm on the road again
And now I'm soaring far too high
A fleck of dust up in the sky
Where tiny clouds go sailing by
Pull me down todayEmbed
