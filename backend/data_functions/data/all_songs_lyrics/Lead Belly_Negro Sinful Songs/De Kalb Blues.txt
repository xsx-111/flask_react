De Kalb Blues LyricsDe Kalb blues, Lord, make me feel so bad
De Kalb blues, Lord, make me feel so bad
Get to thinkin' bout the time which I've had
Women want the powder and the string and comb
Women want the powder and the string and comb
Honey, these De Kalb women would not have a home
When I was with ya, it was a golden time
When I was with ya, it was a golden time
Now the day's long, babe, and you weigh on my mind
De Kalb blues, Lord, make me feel so bad
De Kalb blues, babe, make me feel so bad
Makes me think about the time which I've had
You like walkin', you like stoppin', yeah
You like walkin', you like stoppin', yeah
Have to find some woman, babe, that'll be my cure
See, my baby, see what you've done done
See, my woman, she what you've done done
You made me love you and now you're dead and goneEmbed
