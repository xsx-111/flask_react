The Boll Weevil (1939) Lyrics
You can talk about the latest
The latest of your home
These boll weevils, they will rob you of a home
They're lookin' for a home
They're lookin' for a home

The first time I seen the boll weevil
He was sittin' on a square
Next time I seen the boll weevil
He had his whole family there
He's-a lookin' for a home
He's-a lookin' for a home

The farmer take the boll weevil
Put him in the sand
The boll weevil says to the farmer, "You are treating me just like a man
I'll have a home, I'll-a have a home
And I'll have a home, and I'll have a home
And I'll have a home, and I'll have a home"

Now the farmer, he says to the merchant
"I never made but one bale
Before I'll let you have that last one, I'll suffer and die in jail
And I'll have a home, and I'll have a home"
And the old lady says to her old man
"I been trying my level best
To keep these boll weevils out of my brand new cotton dress
It's full of holes, and it's full of holes
Yes it's full of holes, yes it's full of holes
Yes it's full of holes, yes it's full of holes"

The farmer take the boll weevil
Put him in the ice
The boll weevil said to the farmer, "You treatin' me mighty nice
And I'll have a home, and I'll have a home"

Now if anybody should come along and ask you people who composed this song
Tell 'em its Huddie Ledbetter, he's done been here and gone
He's lookin' for a home, he's lookin' for a home
He's a-lookin' for a home, he's a-lookin' for a home
He's a-lookin' for a home, he's a-lookin' for a homeEmbed
