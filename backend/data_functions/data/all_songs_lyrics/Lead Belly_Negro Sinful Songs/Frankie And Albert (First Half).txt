Frankie And Albert (First Half) Lyrics
Frankie was a woman, everybody knows
Made one hundred dollars, buy her man a suit of clothes
Was her man, but he done her wrong
He was her man, but he done her wrong

Albert had been out all night long
Come in just before day
Frank was cookin' in the white-folk's kitchen
She had to go to work that morning
She told Albert, said "now, baby, you go on and take your rest but I'll be back after a while"
Frankie goes out the door, Albert almost got out of bed before Frankie left 
But he's watchin' Frank
When Frankie walks away, he gets up and leaves and goes out to 
When Frankie come back and found him gone, 
Went and got that smokin' 41
Frankie went a-walkin' with blood in her eyes
She just figured where he was

Frankie went a-walkin', did not go for fun
She had under her apron, Albert's 41
"Kill my man 'cause he done me wrong
Gonna kill my man 'cause he done me wrong"
Frankie went down to Hughes' saloon 
Albert had gone up with his girlfriend known as Alice Fry
Albert told the bartender, "Now don't tell Frankie where I am if she comes here"
Bartender didn't tell him nothin' but he listened
Frankie walked down to the bartender and here's what she said

Frankie went down to the Huddie saloon
Called for a bottle of beer
Asked the loving bartender, "Has my loving man been here?
He's my man and he done me wrong"

I'll tell you 'bout the white man
The white man liked you and liked your wife, too
Don't tell him nothing
If you don't want him tellin', don't tell him, 'cause if you tell him he's sure gon' tell the truth
When Frankie talked to him like that, he run his hands through the front of his hair and he come out and here's what he said

I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie
Albert left here an hour ago with a woman named Alice Fry
He's your man, lawd he done you wrong
He's your man, lawd he done you wrong
Frankie went-a walkin' inEmbed
