Poor Howard / Green Corn Lyrics
Ol' Howard, po' boy
Ol' Howard is dead an' gone
Left me here to sing this song
Left me here to sob and moan
Pretty little gal with a red dress on
Pretty little gal with a red dress on
Pretty little gal with a red dress on
Pretty little gal with a red dress on
God knows, pretty little girl with a red dress on
Ol' Howard is a po' white, he goes all around over the plantations
Plays for the sukey jumps, he is the first man to start the sukey jump playin' in the world
And he would go all around the time and while po' Howard is dead and gone, everybody sings this song about him
Ol' Howard is dead an' gone
Left me here to sing and moan
Ol' Howard po' boy
Ol' Howard, he was a po' boy
Ol' Howard, he was a po' boy
Ol' Howard, he was a po' boy
God knows, left me here to sukey jump

Green corn, green corn
Green corn, come along Charlie
Green corn, go and tell Polly
Green corn, green corn
All I want in this creation
Is little-bitty-wife and big foundation
Two little boys call me papa
One named Thomas and one named David

Green corn, green corn
Green corn, come along Charlie
Green corn, go and tell Polly
Green corn, come along Charlie
Green corn

Boys call me papa
One named Thomas and one named David
One named Thomas and one named David
One's gonna put up, other's gonna save me

Green corn, green corn
Green corn, come along Charlie
Green corn, go and tell Polly
Green corn

Stand around, stand around the demijohn
Stand around, stand around the demijohn
Stand around, stand around the demijohn
Stand around, stand around the demijohn
Green corn, come along Charlie
Green corn, go and tell Polly
Green corn, green corn
Green corn, green corn
Green corn, green corn


Green corn, come along Charlie
Green corn, come along Charlie
Green corn, come along Charlie
Green corn, run and tell Polly
Stand around, stand around
Stand around, stand around
Stand around, stand around the demijohn
Stand around, stand around the demijohnEmbed
