The Bourgeois Blues (1939) Lyrics
Me and my wife went all over town
Everywhere we go, the people would turn us down
Lord, in the bourgeois town
Yee it's a bourgeois town
I got the bourgeois blues
Gonna spread the news all around

Me and Martha, we were standing upstairs
I heard a white man sayin' "I don't want no niggers up there"
Lord, he's a bourgeois man
Yee, it's a bourgeois town
I got the bourgeois blues
Gonna spread the news all around

Home of the brave, land of the free
I don't wanna be mistreated by no bourgeoisie
Lord, in a bourgeois town
Yee, the bourgeois town
I got the bourgeois blues
I'm gonna spread the news all around

Me and my wife we went all over town
Everywhere we go, the colored people would turn us down
Lord, in a bourgeois town
Yee it's a bourgeois town
I got the bourgeois blues
I'm gonna spread the news all around

Them white folks in Washington they know how
To call a colored man a nigga just to see him bow
Lord, it's a bourgeois town
Ooh, the bourgeois town
I got the bourgeois blues
I'm gonna spread the news all around

Tell all the colored folks to listen to me
Don't try to find no home in Washington DC
'Cause it's a bourgeois town
Yee, it's a bourgeois town
I got the bourgeois blues and I'm still gonna spread the news1Embed
