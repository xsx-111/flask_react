Hologram LyricsOh this familiar feeling
Familiar feeling in this place so new
And now I know what's coming
I know what's coming, the faces are turning blue
Kneel by the bed you made
Time ends as you slip away
Feel just this again
One hologram ends, another begins
One hologram ends, another begins
Everything, all at once now
Just as always and always will be
Let it come
As black ash and dust fill the air and lungs
Into the garden I'll find my center
I found peace in dreaming of you and all the things we'll never do
Into the garden I'll meet the maker
And all that I'll never know, this is forever dear
Into the garden I'll find my center
I found peace in dreaming of you and all the things we'll never do
Into the garden
Into the garden
Into the garden
(This is forever dear)
Kneel by the bed you made
Time ends as you slip away
Feel just this again
One hologram ends, another begins
One hologram ends, another beginsEmbed
