Take Your Face Off Lyrics
Take your face off
Put your head back
You're the last to speak
When you're left to

When you're last to

Lawful up on a mantle
Devil with wings
Faster than may be
Faster, prove it, see

When we rise upon the earth
We will lay unbroken
You have always followed me
Since time first began

My mask is blackness
My mother is creation
Except of all default reign
Of the Malachi nation
Do not seem to understand me
I'm your deepest desire
I'm your deepest fear
I am, use me wisely

When you're last toEmbed
