White Shadows LyricsMove apart (backwards)
The spark (backwards)
Emotion and response (backwards)
White shadows glisten in the dark (backwards)
Calling me in this fate
Between the unknown and the nay
Light shadows dancing through my veins
When all is gone and stays the same
Move apart (backwards)
The spark (backwards)
Emotion and response (backwards)
White shadows glisten in the dark (backwards)
White shadows glisten in the dark
Between emotion and response
Between the uncharged and the spark
And in the arms that move apart
Move apart (backwards)
The spark (backwards)
Emotion and response (backwards)
White shadows glisten in the dark (backwards)1Embed
