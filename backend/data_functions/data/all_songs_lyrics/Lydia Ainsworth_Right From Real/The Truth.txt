The Truth LyricsThe cold that knows no bounds
The truth that hears no sounds
A steam that rises off the snow
When nothing else surrounds
How tall is the tallest tree?
How loud is the loudest sound?
In a place where all is seen and heard
The truth is underground
Snowy owls take the breeze
A shake that rattles timber trees
Star shades fade and dim and glow
A truth is hidden far below
I want to feel a truth, more real than real it seems
I want to see a ghost, too clear to see its seams
I want to hear a sound, so true and clear and soft and loud
How tall is the tallest tree?
How loud is the loudest sound?
In a place where all is seen and heard
The truth is underground
How tall is the tallest tree?
How loud is the loudest sound?
In a place where all is seen and heard
The truth is undergroundEmbed
