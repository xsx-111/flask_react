Moonstone LyricsLet's walk the purple mile to the city of Jade
I'll hold your hand in mine but face away
Inactive senses scattered far and wide
Nourish your spirit and receive the light
Moonstone, Opal, Pearl, Quartz
Ruby, Unakite, Pyrite, Selenite
Tigers Eye, Serpentine, Topaz
Tourmaline, Saphire, Appetite
Angelite, Fulgurite, Jade
Jasper, Celestite, Amber
Copper, Emerald, Fire Agate
Onyx, Chiastolite, Tektite, Angelite
Meteorite, Garnet, Citrine, Calcite
Feel the vibrations from the earth it's core
Time stands still as it builds this is the roar
You've always known The Hum and what's in store
Eye's wide up towards the light, move through the door
Moonstone, Opal, Pearl, Quartz
Ruby, Unakite, Pyrite, Selenite
Tigers Eye, Serpentine, Topaz
Tourmaline, Saphire, Appetite
Angelite, Fulgurite, Jade
Jasper, Celestite, Amber
Copper, Emerald, Fire Agate
Onyx, Chiastolite, Tektite, Angelite
Meteorite, Garnet, Citrine, CalciteEmbed
