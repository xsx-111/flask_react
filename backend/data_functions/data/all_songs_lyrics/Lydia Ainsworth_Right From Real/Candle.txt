Candle LyricsSit by the winding road
Breathe in the air of solid gold
Blow out the candle flame
Blow out the change that goes your way
Stand tall, don't delay
One by one by one by one by
Sit by the winding road
Breathe in the air of solid gold
Dream of the perfect life
Dream of the sand, the sea, the sight
One by one by one by one by
Blow out
Blow out
Stand tall
One by one by one by one by
Blow out
Blow out
Stand tall
One by one by one by one by
One by one by one by one byEmbed
