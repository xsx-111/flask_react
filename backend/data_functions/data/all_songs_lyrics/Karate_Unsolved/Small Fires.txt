Small Fires Lyrics
Within the influence of innocence
You were dressed to kill
Pulling styles from the atmosphere
You could have dressed us all
As we surrendered to the worn jets
"Impossible to crash, impossible to fail"
Like the dim lights on the dash
As we were pulling out of anywhere on any other road
Now I can tell by the way the rain hits the glass
That it wants to be cold, it wants to be snow
Is it falling there
Obscuring small fires
That deign another shining front-page spread
Where old worn men conspire?

So much for Saturdays
And other days when lives are at stake
God forgive us for the hatred
For the risks that we take
Boys forget promises from both coasts
Well, what would it take to get out now?

Is this what they call the end?
Are we sleeping on a dark star?
Is this some saint we all forgot?
Is she burning in a parked car?
Because violence is so, so slow
And the patience will do us in
So mothers stop looking for your sons in the woods
Because you will find them on CNN
That's when you will try, try
But you can't evict the sun
It lights up one hour every morning every day
When you know you are the one
So much for Saturdays
And other days when lives are at stake
God forgive us for the hatred
For the risks that we take
Boys forget promises from both coasts
What would it take?
Forget promises from both coasts
What would it take?Embed
