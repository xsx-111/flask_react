Number Six LyricsIf we are Nature's detour
To get to five great names
You are number six
Just neglected by these days
With all the confusion around
Hate, schedules, and possibilities
Under solar-system simulations
Your hesitations elegy
These are the last days
We will spend in this room
Another temporary shell
To help me protect you
On any ordinary night
A sip would last a song
But tonight you're up, on your way out the door
In half as longEmbed
