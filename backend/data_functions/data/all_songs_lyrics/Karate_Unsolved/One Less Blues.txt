One Less Blues LyricsConfidence, it drops like filth in bathroom stalls
Privacy, it leaks through un-completed walls
Forced by public failures, now you must recall
You have to recall
The times when we became hemmed in by leaden skies
The times when all the back rent closed our zealous eyes
Maybe this is how all young ideas die
But they didn't have to die
Evidence yields this case a wash
Just give me something that I can touch
Sulphur, Kool-Aid, Minnesota, freezer burns
Blessed dial lovers' friends at every turn
Needing need, not what you need, can't unlearn
Just try to unlearn
Evidence yields this case a wash
Just give me something that I can touchEmbed
