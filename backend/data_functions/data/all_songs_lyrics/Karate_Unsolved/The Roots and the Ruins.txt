The Roots and the Ruins LyricsThey estimate
The failing sun
And the Orphists' plight
Stimulated no one
So call me
On no sleep
With just a little something
To remind us what to do
If you run, run like hell
And remember there's history
And if they don't believe you
Just send them back to me
Because they can't deny
They just have to see
That the roots and the ruins are the same thing
They are the same thing
I often hear
The new poetry
From your scratchy throat
A quarter-after-three
That's when I know I owe this to you
As autumn owes the trees
With their roots still strong
From the ruins of the same seed
Look out for guns
Look out for girls
And other stories that could tear apart our world
And no matter what
No matter what you do
I will look out for you
Look out for guns
Look out for girls
And other stories that could tear apart our world
And no matter what
No matter what you do
I will look out for youEmbed
