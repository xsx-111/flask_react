Sever Lyrics
Your eyes, they made lies true
Say anything and I would believe you
But there were demons, maybe more than a few
So what could we do?
Because in my life there was only asbestos
And Raymond Williams, you always took the best ones
Now, like failed pedestrian dreams
That's how it seems to me

Once again, back out on the highway
Watch the traffic-you know it's a Friday
And all the seats-belts in all the vans
Won't change your plans
You can get by on a few sins
And you can try to make a horse win once
Cut you can't put back together what you sever

The rain comes down and turns your shine back to rust, yeah
Does that mean that you have to sever us?
Someday some shit will come around and reverse the earth, turn your flesh back to dust
Unless you hold on to something forever

The rain comes down and turns your shine back to rust, yeah
Does that mean that you have to sever us?
Someday some shit will come around and reverse the earth, turn your flesh back to dust
Unless you hold on to something forever
Hold on to something forever
Hold on to something forever
ForeverEmbed
