The Halo of the Strange LyricsSo much simple summer strives to convince us of its pride
To unite all the locals and the details of a ride
Through a pastiche of painless principles and repeated distant-heart designs
Your resilience is your special way to share with me your time
The spareness of monotony and ease will over time
Give us a new energy like Miles, but satisfied
So lose that heady pandering to the over-educated sublime
Because your patience is a simple way to share with me your time
Part of this familiar is the halo of the strange
Part of all the fuck-ups is the will to make a change
Part of this whole routine is your shoulders gentle play
That coaxes this old body into the current of every day
It's me again, talking about some other kind of love
It's me again, reaching down to touch you from above
Won't you just tell me when I can take my place back in your mind
Your patience is a simple way to share with me your time
It's me again, talking about some other kind of love
It's me again, reaching down to touch you from above
Won't you just tell me when I can take my place back in your mind
Your patience is a simple wayEmbed
