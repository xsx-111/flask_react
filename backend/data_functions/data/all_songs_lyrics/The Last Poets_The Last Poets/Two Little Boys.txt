Two Little Boys LyricsHave you seen the skinny little boy
That chases the white ghost at night?
Face puffed up
Tracks in his arm and his mind blown
His momma somewhere drinking
And talking about survival
Pop's in jail or downtown in the Y
The little boy chases the white ghost with his friend
And they get high
And they get high
Like cloud nine
Where everything is fine and
(No responsibility)
Have you seen the two little boys running past you
With a lady's purse?
They stole a black woman's purse
The other day
Yesterday, today, tomorrow
Face puffed up
Tracks in their arms
Eyes popping out of their skulls
And their minds blown
And they get high
And they get high
Talking about tripping, talking bout flying
Talking bout getting high (getting high)
Have you seen two little boys sitting in Sylvia's
Stuffing chicken and cornbread down their tasteless mouths?
Trying to revive a dying heart
Shrinking lungs and wasted minds
Have you seen the sickness of our people?
And all the while we parade around
In robes of our ancestors
And wisdoms of the universe
And all the while there are children dying
Chasing the white ghost
Whitey is dying and his fucking ghost is killing us
Oh beautiful black hands
Reach out and snatch the
Death out of the youth of our nation
Oh beautiful black minds
Create, create the world for children to play with life
And not with death
Oh beautiful black brothers and sisters
Come together and create life
Come together and create love
Come together and create, create
Come together and create, createEmbed
