Black Wish LyricsBlack day is coming
Black day is here
I am a black wish
I am the thought of all things
Thinking or wishing for something to come true
I am the wish in the wishbone
That white people break for good luck
And the next day one of them falls and breaks their neck
I am the wish that makes Walt Disney
Wish upon a star
A star shining like the light of truth
In the darkest night
Wish upon my star, Walt Disney
For I am truth
I am the wish
That makes the white faggot wish
That the  he's eating for lunch will follow him home for dinner
I am the wish
That makes the  old lady wish
She had the body of Cleopatra
The voice of Billie Holiday
The sexiness of Eartha Kitt
And the  of Abbey Lincoln
For then she would be truly beautiful
And her hairdresser would have to wish if she knew for sure
I am the wish that makes George Wallace wish
He can make love to Lola Falana
I am the wish that makes all niggers and negroes
Wish for alligator shoes, white thighs, El Dorados
And wish that they didn't run out of wishes
I am the wish that makes Nina Simone
Wish she knew how it felt to be free
I am the wish all black people are wishing for
I am the wish of freedom
Yes, I am the wish of black freedom
And I wish, and I wish, and I wish
And I wish I know, and I know I wish
And I wish I know, and I know I wish
And I wish and I know and I know and I know
That that wish will come trueEmbed
