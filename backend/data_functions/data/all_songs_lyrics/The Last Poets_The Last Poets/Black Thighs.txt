Black Thighs Lyrics
Black thighs
Black thighs bumping, grinding
Black thighs
Black thighs making me forget all pain
Age gently
Shooting my love, forsaking bodies
Black thighs
Black thighs digging nails into me
Making love out of my song
Black muscles making me forget all about white thighs, white love
Lovely black thighs
Black thighs, lovely black thighs
Black thighs making me moan, scream, cry
Beg, grab, hold, fight for every inch of love
Down and up, up and down, round and round
Over here, over there
Fighting for love everywhere
Black thighs, loving me
Ooh, do it, ooh, do it
Black thighs holding me
Black thighs doing a job to me
Fighting, fighting, thinking, holding, praying
Sighing, stabbing, jabbing, loving, black thighs
Trembling, shaking, pulsating
Vibrating, climax in the sky
Ooooh
Black thighs, I love youEmbed
