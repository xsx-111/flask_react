Run, Nigger Lyrics
I understand that time is running out
I understand that time, is running out
I understand that time is running out
I understand that time is running out
Running out as hastily as niggers run from the Man
Time is running out, on our natural habits
Time is running out, on lifeless serpents reigning over a living kingdom
Time is running out of talks, marches, tunes, chants, and all kinds of prayers
Time, is running out of time
Heard someone say, "Things were changing" (Changing - things are changing!)
Change, chan-chan-chan-changing
From brown to black
Time is running out on bullshit changes
Running out like a bushfire in a dry forest
Like a murder from the scene of a crime
Like a little roach from DDT
Running out like big niggers, running a football field - run nigga!!
Screwing your woman (run niggers!)
Whooping your ass (run niggers!)
Stealing your culture (run niggers!)
Taking your life (run niggers!)
Killing your children (run niggers!)
Run nigga!
Run like you run, when the liquor store's closing and it's Saturday night
Run nigga, 'cause time is running
Run like time, never yielding or forgiving
Moving forward, in a direct pattern of aggressive movement
Never warning or relinquishing
Time, is running, running, running, running, running, running, running
Time's done run out!1Embed
