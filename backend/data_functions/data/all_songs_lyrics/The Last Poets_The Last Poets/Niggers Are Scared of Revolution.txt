Niggers Are Scared of Revolution Lyrics
Niggers are scared of revolution
But niggers shouldn't be scared of revolution
Because revolution is nothing but change
And all niggers do is change

Niggers come in from work and change into pimping clothes
And hit the streets to make some quick change
Niggers change their hair from black to red to blond
And hope like hell their looks will change
Nigga kill other niggers just because one didn't receive the correct change
Niggers change from men to women, from women to men
Niggers change, change, change
You hear niggers say, "Things are changing? Things are changing?"
Yeah, things are changing
Niggers change into "Black" nigga things
"Black" nigga things that go through all kinds of changes
The change in the day that makes them rant and rave "Black Power, Black Power!"
And the change that comes over them at night
As they sigh and moan, "White thighs, ooh, white thighs"
Niggers always goin' through bullshit change
But when it comes for real change

Niggers are scared of revolution
Niggers are actors, niggers are actors
Niggers act like they are in a hurry
To catch the first act of the "Great White Hope"
Niggers try to act like Malcolm
And when the white man doesn't react toward them like he did Malcolm
Niggers want to act violently
Niggers act so cool and slick, causing white people to say
"What makes you niggers act like that?"
Niggers act like you ain't never seen nobody act before
But when it comes to acting out revolution
Niggers say, "I can't dig them actions!"

Niggers are scared of revolution

Niggers are very untogether people
Niggers talk about getting high and riding around in L's
Niggers should get high and ride to hell
Niggers talk about pimping
Pimping that, pimping what? Pimping yours, pimping mine
Just to be pimping is a helluva line
Niggers are very untogether people
Niggers talk about the mind, talk about
"My mind is stronger than yours," "I got that bitch's mind uptight!"
Niggers don't know a damn thing about the mind, or they'd be right
Niggers are scared of revolution

Niggers fuck, niggers fuck, fuck, fuck
Niggers love the word fuck
They think it's so fuckin' cute, they fuck you around
The first thing they say when they're mad is, "Fuck it!"
You play a little too much with them, they say "Fuck you"
When it's time to TCB
Niggers are somewhere fucking
Try to be nice to them, they fuck over you
Niggers don't realize while they doin' all this fucking
They're getting fucked around
And when they do realize it's too late
So niggers just get fucked up
Niggers talk about fucking
Fuckin' that, fuckin' this, fuckin' yours, fuckin' my sis
Not knowing what they're fucking for
They ain't fucking for love and appreciation
Just fucking to be fucking
Niggers fuck White thighs, Black thighs
Yellow thighs, Brown thighs
Niggers fuck ankles when they run out of thighs
Niggers fuck Sally, Linda, and Sue
And if you don't watch out, niggers will fuck you!
Niggers would fuck "Fuck" if it could be fucked
But when it comes to fucking for revolutionary causes
Niggers say, "Fuck revolution!"
Niggers are scared of revolution

Niggers are players, niggers are players, are players
Niggers play football, baseball and basketball
While the white man is cuttin' off their balls
When the nigga's play ain't tight enough
To play with some black thighs
Niggers play with white thighs
To see if they still have some play left
And when there ain't no white thighs to play with
Niggers play with themselves
Niggers tell you they're ready to be liberated
But when you say "Let's go take our liberation"
Niggers reply, "I was just playin'!"
Niggers are playing with revolution and losing

Niggers are scared of revolution

Niggers do a lot of shootin', niggers do a lot of shootin'
Niggers shoot off at the mouth
Niggers shoot pool, niggers shoot craps
Niggers cut around the corners and shoot down the street
Niggers shoot sharp glances at White women
Niggers shoot dope into their arm
Niggers shoot guns and rifles on New Year's Eve
A new year that is coming in
The white police will do more shooting at them
Where are niggers when the revolution needs some shots?
Yeah, you know, niggers are somewhere shootin' the shit

Niggers are scared of revolution

Niggers are lovers, niggers are lovers are lovers
Niggers love to see Clark Gable make love to Marilyn Monroe
Niggers love to see Tarzan fuck all the natives
Niggers love to hear the Lone Ranger yell, "High ho, Silver!"
Niggers love commercials, niggers love commercials
Oh how niggers love commercials
"You can take niggers out of the country, but
You can't take the country out of niggers"
Niggers are lovers, are lovers, are lovers
Niggers loved to hear Malcolm rap, but they didn't love Malcolm
Niggers love everything but themselves
But I'm a lover too, yes I'm a lover too
I love niggers, I love niggers, I love niggers
Because niggers are me, and I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggers go through changes, love to see niggers act
Love to see niggers make them plays and shoot the shit
But there is one thing about niggers I do not love
Niggers are scared of revolution4Embed
