Just Because LyricsJust because you're black
Just because you're black
You say you don't want to die because
(Justice)
I don't want to die because
(Justice)
You say you don't want to die
Because there's no cause to die for
Now what would cause you to say that?
Is it because you have a good job
And a home in the suburbs?
Or is it because you wear pink and yellows
Causing all the women
To scream from a cause unknown?
Just because you're seemingly satisfied
That's no cause
To forget who is the cause
Of black people being exploited and depressed
There have been many causes men have chosen to die for
But many black men are dying for a cause
And because you think there's no cause to die for
Malcolm, Denmark, Martin, all died because they knew
What was the cause
Causing all of us to be exploited and depressed
I hope you get a cause to die for soon
Because you're going to die anyway
Just because you're black
Yes, I hope you get right soon
So there won't be anything causing me to die
Because you didn't believe in our cause
Niggers and negroes, listen to this
It's glorious to die for a cause
But not becauseEmbed
