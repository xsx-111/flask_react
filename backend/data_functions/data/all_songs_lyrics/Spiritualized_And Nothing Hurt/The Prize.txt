The Prize Lyrics
Time
Lends you her shotgun for a while
Gonna be shooting like a star across the sky
Gonna burn brightly for a while
Then youâ€™re gone
And maybe
It's not too late to change your mind
But I don't know, dear
If love will live or if it'll die
And I don't know if love's alive

And time
We've got a life and life's a prize
But I don't know, dear
If love, dear, will fall or if it'll rise
And I don't know if love's the prize

And maybe
It's not too late to say good bye
But I don't know, dear
If love, dear, will care or if it don't mind
And I don't know if love's the prize
And I don't know if love's the prize
And I don't know if love's the prize

And maybe
It's just impossible to know
If I should stay here with you, dear
Stay here or if I should go
And I don't know if love, don't know
And maybe
I should get down on my knees and say
But I don't owe anything or anymore to anyone else today
And I don't know if love's the way

And maybe
You've got no dreams but rest assured
There's a whole lifetime ahead of you
To dance along the shore
And I don't know if love's the cure
And I don't know if love's so pure
And I don't know if love's the prizeEmbed
