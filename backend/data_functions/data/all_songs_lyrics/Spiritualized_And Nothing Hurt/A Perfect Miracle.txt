A Perfect Miracle Lyrics
I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
I'd part the clouds and have the sun proudly shining on you
I'd take the stars as well and line them up to spell "Darling, I love you"
And little by little watch it all come true
I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
I'd catch the wind and have it blow all my kisses to you
I'll take the birds and teach them all the words of every love song I know
And I'd have them fly around and sing them all to you

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see you today
My mind is a mess and I'm needing you less
Give me a call in a little while

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
'Cause every time I close my eyes, I'm just dreaming of you
There ain't a man around could knock me off my cloud 'cause "Darling, I love you"
And little by little watch it all come true

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see you this week
Lately I've found I don't need you around
I don't think it's working out anyway
Anyway, and...
I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
'Cause you're the only girl I ever met who's honest and true
I'd like to settle down with you and mess around a house on the hill
And I'm sitting here hoping it'll all come true
(Sitting here hoping it'll all come true)

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
(I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle)
I won't get to see you this spring
(I'd part the clouds and have the sun proudly shining on you)
My phone has been broke and I thought that we spoke
(I'd take the stars as well and line them up to spell "Darling, I love you")
Don't think it's working out anyway
(And little by little watch it all come true)
Anyway, and...
Darling, you know, I'm sorry
(I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle)
I won't get to see you this year
(I'd catch the wind and have it blow all my kisses to you)
I hate to confess but I've changed my address
(I'll take the birds and teach them all the words of every love song I know)
I haven't been home in a little while
(And I'd have them fly around and sing them all to you)
A little while, and...
Darling, you know, I'm sorry
(I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle)
I won't get to see you again
(I'd like to tell the whole world I'm crazy 'bout you)
I met someone else, you should do it yourself
(I like you every second, every minute, every hour of the day)
So darling, please don't call
(But now I'm sitting here going "When you gonna come home?")
Please don't call3Embed
