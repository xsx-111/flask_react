Sail on Through Lyrics
I'll hold on tight, I'll hold on true
Was the best thing I could do for you
And when we have some kind of love
Was like the song sent down from way above
I tell no lie, I tell the truth
Y'know I just don't need to be with you

If I could hold it down
I would sail on through for you
If I weren't loaded down
I would sail on through for you

I'll say no more, I'll say no less
You know you took it all but you wanted less
I came on down, I gave it all
You know best love lies before the fall

If I could hold it down
I would sail on through for you
If I weren't loaded down
I would sail on through for you
If I could hold it down
I would sail on through for you
If I weren't loaded down
I would sail on through for you
If I could hold it down
I would sail on through for you
If I weren't loaded down
I would sail on through for you
If I could hold it down
I would sail on through for youEmbed
