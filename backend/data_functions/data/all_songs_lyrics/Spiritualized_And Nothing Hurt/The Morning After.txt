The Morning After Lyrics
Janey said she had a problem with the modern world
All the boys she ever loved are with another girl
And her father always wanna bring her way down low and
All the doctors that she met have got a way to go

Janey said she had a problem with her mother's wealth
Said she ought to cut and run and grow up by herself
So, she wrote a letter to them on the way to school
The way to school now
Said she cannot live her life under her father's rule

Don't call the morning after
Won't stop the pain and laughter
Won't fix the failing plan
You gotta pay the man
You gotta give it all away
And you have gotta go

Janey said she had a problem with her failing health
Said she's gonna fix it all up on the National Health
She only got a couple of worries gotten out of hand and
When she tells her doctors that they never understand
Don't call the morning after
Won't stop the pain and laughter
Won't help to pass the blame
You gotta take the pain
You gotta give it all away
And you have gotta go

Janey had a revelation on the way to school
Said she's gonna hang herself up by the bathing pool
She's really gonna lay it on them 'cause she always knew that
Every mother wants to die before her children do

Don't call the morning after
Won't stop the big disaster
Don't miss the main event
You gotta pay the rent
You gotta give it all away
And you have gotta go

Come on, come on, come on, come on
We're living in the modern world
Come on, come on, come on, come on
We're living in the modern world
Come on, come on, come on, come on
We're living in the modern world
Come on, come on, come on, come on
We're living in the modern worldEmbed
