On the Sunshine LyricsOn the sunshine
In the morning
It's the dawning baby
Of a brand new precious day
And in the evening
Take it easy
You can always do tomorrow
What you cannot do today
In the morning light
Don't it feel alright
You can always shoot the messenger
The moment they arrive
And in the evening rain
Comin' round again
You can always count your blessings babe
Before the foul has laid
And though it's hard to see
Like the leaves from the trees
You can shake the monkey from your back
The circus never leaves
And in the morning light
All that wasted time
'Cause it's only in the darkness
That the stars begin to shine
And in the faded light
All the angels sing
When you reach the ends of all your lines
Then tie a knot and swing
And save your bleedin' soul
Save your bleedin' soul
If youth is wasted on the young
Then wisdom on the old
And let it go
C'mon let it roll
State of mind
State of mind
State of mind
On the sunshine
In the morning light
You can feel the dawning baby
Of a brand new precious day
And in the evening
Take it easy
You can always fix tomorrow
What you can't pull off today
And take it easy
All these wasted years
Celebrate your finest
And the music of the spheres
And take it easy
Take it easy
Take the monkey from your back
The circus never leaves
And let it go
Let it go
If youth is wasted on the young
Then wisdom on the old
And take it easy
Take it easy
Open up that golden gate
And let it all arrive
Let it roll
Easy
State of mind
State of mind
State of mind
Let it roll
Let it roll
Let it roll
Let it rollEmbed
