Damaged Lyrics
And I wanna just close my eyes
Feel like I'm living, feel like I'm alive
Wrapped up in clover, and I'm safe from the tide
Feel like I'm floating, and I'm laid out in time

Darlin' I'm lost
And I'm damaged over you

And I wanna just close my mind
Feel like I'm floating on ship out of time
Wrapped up and golden
'Cause I made up my mind

Darlin' I'm lost
And I'm broken over you


And I wanna just take my time
Feel like I'm broken, and I'm laid out and dying
Wasted and stolen
Quell the cavalier child
Darlin' I'm lost
And I'm damaged over youEmbed
