My Stress Lyrics
Yeah

(Oh) Some days, I just wanna leave the negativity in my head
I just want relief from my stress
I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
Some days, I don't wanna see or
Have a bunch of people to impress
I just want relief from my stress
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress (Oh)

Late nights (Late nights), starin' out the window doin' 85
Got my state of mind
Yeah, walkin' on that gray line
Hopin' that my stress dies
It's like I hate it but I love it at the same time (Oh) (Same time)
Pressure pushin' me from all sides
Insecurities of all kinds (All kinds)
Yeah, I'm a hostage to my own pride
Most important things in life to me are things I know I can't buy (Oh)
Ayy, yeah, it's me in phases
I'm not in the mood, yeah, to meet another stranger
I'm not in the mood, yeah, to have a conversation
And talk about a bunch of things that I don't feel amazed with
Gettin' too close to me (Oh), woo, could be dangerous
I don't like the energy, I leave the situation
All this negativity that I can't get away from
All this negativity, I think I need a break from
I'm thankful, butâ€¦ (Oh)
Some days, I just wanna leave the negativity in my head
I just want relief from my stress
I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
Some days, I don't wanna see or
Have a bunch of people to impress
I just want relief from my stress
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress (Oh)

Yo, this life got my head spinnin'
Wonder what I'd do if I knew these were my last minutes
Wonder if I had a week to live, would I stay trippin'?
Wastin' every day that I had left tryna sell tickets
Or maybe call my dad (Oh), say I love him and laugh with him
Take a couple days and get away from this fast livin'
I don't love my work the way I did
Man, this whole business has got me feelin' jaded
Friends I had, now they act different, it's all switchin', whoa (Ayy) (Oh)
Yeah, it's pretty hard to watch
Those things you used to love turn to things that you wish you forgot
Real moments that make you question the things that you want's
Got me growin' mentally, but stressin' me out 'til I drop
Over the top (Oh), that's where I live on a daily basis
I always find a way to find the bad in good situations
It's sad, huh?
Yeah, I live my life on the edge, don't want the meds
I'm just tryna get relief from my stress, you know? (Oh)
Some days, I just wanna leave the negativity in my head
I just want relief from my stress
I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
Some days, I don't wanna see or
Have a bunch of people to impress
I just want relief from my stress
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress (Oh)

These stress levels are not healthy
I'm waitin' for that call sayin' records are not selling
I wonder when this all disappears and they forget me
Will I feel like I found who I was or be more empty?
I wonder was I wrong thinkin' this is where God led me
Or did I get involved with somethin' that was too heavy?
I drive until I'm lost and just sit in my car yelling
My inner critic talks, I'm just hopin' that God helps me to stop stressin'
Yeah

(Oh) Some days (Some days)
I just wanna leave the negativity in my head (I just wanna leave it)
I just want relief from my stress (Yeah, I just wanna leave it)
I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
Some days (Some days), I don't wanna see or
Have a bunch of people to impress (Yeah)
I just want relief from my stress
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
Yeah
Yeah, some days
Yeah, some days
I just wanna leave, yeah
I just wanna leave, yeah41Embed
