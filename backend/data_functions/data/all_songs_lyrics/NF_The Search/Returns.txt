Returns Lyrics
What is perfect? Not me
I've been overworkin' for weeks
I go home then purchase some things
That I know will not fill my needs
Have a dose of what I've achieved
Then get lonesome and I critique
Who I am and what I believe
Make up standards too high to reach
Untrained animal off the leash
I'm in panic, but yet relieved
Brought your hammock to hang with me?
Grab a hatchet, cut down your tree
Like a mannequin that can speak
What I have in store is unique
I just mop the floors with MCs
I can't stop until things are clean
I'm an amateur's what you think
So you stand there in disbelief
'Til I dislocate both your feet
That's what happens, you step to me
Not too graphic, but not PG
Lots of action in every scene
I'm kidnapping all of your dreams
Hold 'em hostage and watch 'em scream (Ahh!)
Rap aside, I am what I advertise
Don't matter how you put it, we live, then we have to die
You might hate it, but you can't deny
See, everything that I've been doing got me lookin' like a mastermind
It's so vain, but I vandalize that I do what you fantasizin'
Took a vision of my dreams
And then found a better way that I can make it
I've been looking, think I'm really 'bout to maximize it (Agh!)
These bullets form in my mind and come out my mouth and (Pow, pow, pow)
For anyone out there doubting or acting mouthy (Watch, watch, watch)
Forget what you heard about me, I've been astounding (Got, got, got)
Something for you thinking you might run circles 'round me
Yeah, ain't this all I ever wanted?
That's a fact, no, that's a lie, no
I'm confused, yeah, I got problems
What's the use? Yeah, let's be honest
Screws are loose, I need 'em tightened
Not amused, yeah, look what I did
Brought you something, hope you like it
So precise, the flow the nicest
So productive, stop your whining
Back in style like I was vinyl
I make songs and they go viral
Something's off if I go idle
"Been so long," yeah, okay, I know
Take your shoes off, you're in my home
You got fans, but not like I do, yeah (I do, I do)
Thankful, I try to be, can't contain what's inside of me
They don't like this side of me 'cause I lack in compliancy
I question what I can see if you're not playing my CD
No expiring, I'll decide when I think it's my time to leave (Woo)
Yeah, 'cause they won't retire me, it inspires me to be inspiring
When I'm low I feel like I'm spiraling
Pushin' forward, look, I can't ignore it
There ain't no I in team, but drop the T and A
Sometimes, if I'm bein' honest, feels like it's only me
No defeat, notably, better have it right if you're quoting me
Write my name on your hit list, it might be the last time you wrote something
Rip that cocky smile right off your face for thinking you're close to me
Grab a can of gasoline, light it all over your self-esteem
Selfishly watching y'all helplessly pretend you're on my planet
Shoot you out of the sky like you're punchlines, you are not landin'
Gun jammin', reach in your mouth and rip out your tongue after tongue
Lashings, I hand 'em out like pamphlets in church, Pastor
Show up to my funeral wearin' all black, and what's happenin'?
I look around and wonder, "Where my fans at?"
Oh Lord, they know me so well, they know I'm not in that casket
Trash bag is prolly buried somewhere full of my ashes
My music's superb, playin' with words, play with my nerves
They gon' have a list of issues long as my shirts
Very absurd, very disturbed
Stare at the Earth like, "This is not the place I was birthed"
I'm generic, you sure?
Oh, they think I'm very reserved
'Til I open up on the beat like on my Therapy work
I don't care what you heard, real scary, carry the verse
While I'm wearin' my merch, stompin' on your arrogant turf
Sit back and observe, nah, I like to actually work
This life's so unpredictable, it just keeps pitching me curves
I take a swing, I hate the things that make me feel like I'm dirt
I've patiently been waitin', please, I think it's time for my turn
My expertise are melodies, they talk to me when I'm hurt
Just let me be, eventually someday they'll see what I'm worth
I cross my I's and dot my T's, it makes no sense, but I've learned
Normal to you is not to me, the outcast finally returns (Returns, returns)72Embed
