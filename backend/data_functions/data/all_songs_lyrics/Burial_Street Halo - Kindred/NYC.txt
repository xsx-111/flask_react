This is love
And I see
Me and you know
This is love
When I'm around you
When I'm around
Ooh

Nobody loves me
No, no
No

Nobody loves me
NYC
Nobody loves me
No
Me and you know
This is love
Me and you know
This is love
When I'm around you
When I'm around
Ooh
Nobody loves me
No, no
NYC
Nobody loves me1Embed
