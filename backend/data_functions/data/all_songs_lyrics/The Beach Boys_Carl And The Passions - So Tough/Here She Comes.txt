Here She Comes Lyrics
Here she comes
Breathing life in to my thoughts
There she goes
Leaves a portrait in my soul
Rolling in madness
She does everything to me
Wherever she goes you know the devil dances
And the gods lay down in defeat

Am I living
Crazy woman can't you see
That I'm giving
Giving to you can you dig
Me

I want to live
To learn the truth before my door
Don't you know
I'm a simple man for all I know
This might be the hard way
But it's easier for me
To take all the changes that are always amazing
But to never let them fence me in

Me I'm only searching for the things I really need
I can't rely on anyone to sow and grow my seeds
I started out on empty promise I was living on my dreams
I was a runaway son and now I'm up out of the water
And I can barely barely breathe

Rolling down the road
Listen listen
Hear the music play
Listen listen
Hear the music play yeah
Listen listen
Hear the music play
Listen listen
Hear the music play
