All This Is That Lyrics
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
This is that
Oooo

Daybreak and I take a glide
Into the pool of peace inside
(Two ways travel by)
Two ways and I both travel by
(And that makes all the difference to me)
Life supporting waves of bliss
Mother Divine's precious kiss
Brings with love the light of wisdom
And the gift of eternal freedom
Two ways and I both travel by
(... and the nature of man...)
And that makes all the difference to me
(Krishna...)


Dusk time the shadows fall
Into the timeless time of all
Two ways and I both travel by
Golden auras glow around you
Omnipresent love surrounds you
Wisdom warming as the sun
You and I are truly one
Two ways and I both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me
