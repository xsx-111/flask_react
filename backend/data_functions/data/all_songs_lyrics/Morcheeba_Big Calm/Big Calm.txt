Big Calm LyricsTrapped in the skies what am I to do?
Brothers from another planet. Ya know the truth
Papa was a Rolling Stone
Nigga Never brouh

You fell with watching
Makes these pigs think my styles be drones, hah!
Fuck that bullshit
Rather walk alone
Nigga standing on the verge of, you know the song
Super rocking, Nosaj the Great
And morcheeba, how much more can you take?
It's a
Te-te-te-te-terrible
Te-te-te-te-terrible
It's morcheeba
Super rocking, brothers from another planet
Ya know the truth
It's morcheeba
Super rocking brother's from another planet
Ya know the truth
Super rocking, Nosaj the Great
And morcheeba, how much more can you take?
It's a
Te-te-te-te-terrible
Te-te-te-te-terrible
On our way to the moon
Te-te-te-te-terrible
Te-te-te-te-terrible
On our way to the moon
Te-te-te-te-terrible
Te-te-te-te-terrible
(Do you believe? Do you really believe?)
Te-te-te-te-terrible
Te-te-te-te-terrible
(Do you believe? Do you really believe?)
It's morcheeba and a spaceship sighted
(Do you believe? Do you really believe?)
It's morcheeba and a spaceship sighted
(Do you believe? Do you really believe?)
It's morcheeba and a spaceship sighted
(Do you believe? Do you really believe?)Embed
