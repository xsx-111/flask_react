Shoulder Holster Lyrics(Alright!)
I am the new—
For reasons I can never explain
I speak the truth—
I put an end to all your pain
I want guilt—
I want to drag you right through your past
I'm on a roll—
And I'm moving way too fast
(Alright!)
Aren't we
Always looking over our shoulders?
Aren't we
Always drawing guns from our holsters?
(Shoot you!)
I'm at the start—
To check every hour of the day
I stand well above—
And mold you with my clay
Out of the depth—
Every soul can pay a fee
Those who are kept—
I'm going to set you free!
(Alright!)
Aren't we
Always looking over our shoulders?
Aren't we
Always drawing guns from our holsters?
(Shoot you!)
I'll shed light—
Tear apart all you believe
One of us—
Grateful for all you receive
Make it up—
Do you find it hard to contain?
Pray in God—
Can you hold it all inside your brain?
(Alright!)
Aren't you
Always getting scared of the future?
Aren't you
Always thinking someone will shoot you?
(Shoot you!)
Aren't we
Always looking over our shoulders?
(Shoot you!)
Aren't we
Always drawing guns from our holsters?
(Shoot you!)
(Shoot you!)
(Alright!)Embed
