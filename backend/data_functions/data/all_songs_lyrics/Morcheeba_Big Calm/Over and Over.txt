Over and Over LyricsWaking to these sounds again
I wonder how I'll sleep
Passing out is taking off into the stubborn deep
I'd like to meet a human who makes it all seem clear
To work out all these cycles and why I'm standing here
I'm falling
Over and over and over and over again now
Calling over and over and over and over again now
Running through my life right now
I don't regret a thing
The things I do just make me laugh and make me wanna drink
I'd like to meet a mad man who makes it all seem sane
To work out all these troubles and what there is to gain
I'm falling
Over and over and over and over again now
Calling over and over and over and over again now
Projecting what I want is always hard to know
But when it comes between my sights I'll let the damage show
I'd like to meet a space man, who's got it going on
Sailing through the stars at night 'til our world is gone
I'm falling
Over and over and over and over again now
Calling over and over and over and over again now
Over and over and over and over again now
Calling over and over and over and over again nowEmbed
