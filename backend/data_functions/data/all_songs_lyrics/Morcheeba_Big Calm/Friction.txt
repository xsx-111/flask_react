Friction LyricsLocked in a cell for your very last breath
How can it be that
That this is your death
Something is stirring, way underneath
As people ignite the last burning wreath
Friction is turning to fire
Friction is burning much higher
Men in high places
Can't understand
How to end trouble in this broken land
They have no idea and no feelings for love
Just send in the dogs and they stand well above
Friction is turning to fire
Friction is burning much higher
Them say me bringing the naughty dread
So now I fight for me life
Can't feel me you
Now can't feel me wife
Me a feature until you leave unpleased because
Try my call me and beg me 

Don't return to send the light out there
That's why the friction can't seize, yeah
Red is the vision
Flames light the street
Danger in droves as we feel the heat
All coming together, the time is now ripe
Think for yourself and forget all the hype !
Friction is turning to fire
Friction is burning much higher
Friction is turning to fire
Friction is burning much higher
Fire brought to my babylon
Turning to fire
Fire burning near my babylon, know how
Burning much higher
I'll tell you fire burning the babylon
Turning to fire
Fire burning down the babylon, know how
Burning much higherEmbed
