CLOUDS Lyrics
You should never underestimate the power of a kiss on the neck, When she doesn't expect
A kiss on the neck, when she doesn't expect, a kiss on the neck
And every time you catch her singin' in the shower
You should go and get her a flower
Don't matter what they what the hour
Just rub it on her back, rub it on her back, rub it on her back

In this brand new age
We do everything quick, fast in a hurry
All of our lives a stage
Everybody stars, reality's so blury
If you screamed out loud (loud)
Top of your voice wouldn't be high-er up than the crowd, no
Tattoo-less and proud, yeah
We're getting high on something, that doesn't require clouds, no
We don't need no clouds, no

You should never underestimate the power of a kiss on the neck, When she doesn't expect
A kiss on the neck, when she doesn't expect, a kiss on the neck
And every time you catch her singin' in the shower
You should go and get her a flower
Don't matter what they what the hour
Just rub it on her back, rub it on her back, rub it on her back
I wanna  gonna give you something baby
But I wonder does it really even matter if it ain't on the stage
If it ain't on a stage, I don't really think it matters in this brand new age

When life's a stage, in this brand new age
How do we engage?
Bullying just for fun
No wonder there's so many guns
Maybe we're better off in space

Mr Nelson, Mr Nelson, can you hear my voice?
Sir, we know you're a little bit groggy
And you're probably going to find it hard to speak
But don't try to talk or process too much now
We just want to let you know that the medication you were given
Has put you in a suspended animation for quite some time
In fact 45 years
But where you are now, is in a place that does not require time
That being said, you are completely safe
And we are here to help you"

You should never underestimate the power of a kiss on the neck, which she doesn't expect
A kiss on the neck, which she doesn't expect, a kiss on the neck
It's in my power to love you
It's in my power to love you up
It's in my power to love you
It's in my power to love you up
