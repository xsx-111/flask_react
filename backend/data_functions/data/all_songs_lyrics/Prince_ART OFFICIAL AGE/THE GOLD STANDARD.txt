THE GOLD STANDARD Lyrics
They shut your party down, make you walk around
Let me feel all you bobbin' and you troubles gets...
(Go, go, go, go)
They shut your party down, make you walk around
Let me feel all you bobbin' and you troubles gets...
(Go, go, go, go)
They shut your party down, make you walk around
Let me feel all you bobbin' and you troubles gets...
Move
Everybody get ready to move
(Go, go, go, go)
Oh yeah
Everybody, everybody
Come on
Listen

We know what y'all be thinkin', nude is the brand new yawn
Everybody's just drinkin', inhibitions just gone

You don't need to be rude, you don't need to be wild
Whatever you do, no compromise and done with style

The gold standard, crazy amazing, upper echelon groove
The gold standard, crazy amazing, turn it up, let your body move
You
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' to you
Got to, got to let your body move

We know what y'all be feelin', there use to be a time
(Be a time)
Music was like a spiritual healing, the body, the soul, and mind
(Some medicine)

You don't need to be rude, you don't need to be wild
If what you play take your troubles away and make somebody smile

The gold standard, crazy amazing, upper echelon groove
The gold standard, crazy amazing, turn it up,  let your body move

You
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' to you
Oh yeah

They shut your party down
Make you walk around
Let me see you all bobbin' and your troubles get sold
Twenty-four carrot hashtag, put your phone in your bag
Ain't nobody got to tell you put your hands in the air, say "Ow!"
When the beat's too much, you need to drop that cup
One left and right hands up, everybody just...
Everybody just...
Swing your hip to the left and right
If you know about the "Bus Stop," there's a tight hook
Now everybody just shake
Shake
New power slide
New power slide
Ha, ha, ha
Here come the chorus y'all
The gold standard, crazy amazing, upper echelon groove
The gold standard, crazy amazing, turn it up, let your body move

Turn it up, let me see that body move
Let me see your body move
Turn it up, let me see that body move
Let me see your body move
Turn it up, let me see that body move
Body, body move
Turn it up, let me see that body move
Turn it up, let me see that body move
Turn it up, let me see that body move
(Let me)
Turn it up, let me see that body move
(Let me see yor body, babe)
Turn it up, let me see that body move
That body move
(So amazing)
Gon' see that, that body move
(Baby, you're amazing)
That body move
(The gold standard)
Gon' see that, that body move
(Oh baby)
Hey baby
Oh yeah? Really?
No, that's cool
Bring it here
All the way here, come on
Let me get in there
Good God, mmm
Keep it there
This is exciting, it's different1Embed
