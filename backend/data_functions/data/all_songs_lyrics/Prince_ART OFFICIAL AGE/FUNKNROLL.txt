FUNKNROLL Lyrics
U-uh
Wooo!
Let's
Funk
Roll
Funk
Let's
Get it turnt up, get it
Get it turnt up, get it
Unh
Let's funk

So finally beloved we meet at last
Middle of the here, never mind the past
Only way to get to where you never been
Is party like you ain't gonna party again

Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Getting to the rhythm is good for the soul
Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funknroll
Whether you're coming by bus or a train
Shade throwers hating cause they're going insane
I'm talkin' bout the million dollar party to the nickel and dime
Another mother further you're committing a crime

Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Getting to the rhythm is good for the soul
Let's funk, yes sir, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funknroll

The only way to last 'til the break of dawn
Is put your phone down get your party on
Who you gonna call when it's obvious dear?
Everyone you know is rockin' in here, so let's funk
Roll
Unh

Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Getting to the rhythm is good for the soul
Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funknroll
I don't really care what y'all be doin'
(I don't really care what y'all be doin')
(I don't really care, I don't really care)
(I don't really care what y'all be doin')
(I don't really care what y'all be doin')
(I don't really care what y'all be doin')
(I don't really care, I don't really care)
(I don't really care what y'all be doin')
Ouch!

Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Getting to the rhythm is good for the soul
Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funknrollEmbed
