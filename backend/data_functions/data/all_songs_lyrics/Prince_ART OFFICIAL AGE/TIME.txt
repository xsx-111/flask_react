TIME Lyrics
This song's about time
I said it's about time
About time with you
Alright
I think it's bout time
That I got time
Alone with you
Alone with you

I think I'm running out of patience
I think I'm running out of lies
I think its bout time I tell the truth
Instead of these alibis

Well, I think its bout time
That I got time
Alone with you
'Cause you're so fine
When I get mine
Baby you can too

No more peace and quiet
I wonder why
A party full of drunken fools
I bet the sound will be the rushing tide
Splashin' all over you
I don't wanna work another day baby
(No no stay with me)
I wish u could stay with me
(Stay with me)
I don't think it matters anyway
(It don't matter girl)
For you I'm as rich as I could be
Baby baby
Oh, I think its bout time
That I got time
Alone with you
I know, I know
'Cause you're so fine
When I get mine
Baby you can too
Sho nuff

Sugar, well I'm thinking
That you really need to be my pet
Oh really?
And let me put you in my little cage, c'mon
I'm sick and tired of playing hard to get
With an animal that's half my age
Sugar, well well
My head's a little dizzy
My head's spinning around and around
Another dirty hotel room
Another lonely town
I need some time to rest
I need some time with you
This is what it feels like
I know what I wanna do
This is what it feels like
Gonna lemme tell you one time
Well, I think its bout time
That I got time
Alone with you
Baby, baby
'Cause you're so fine
When I get mine
Baby you can too
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh oh, I think I need you to be my girl
Travel with me around the world
Baby baby
So's on paper this works out fine
So fine, so fine
But not half as fine
As when I get time
With you

Well, I think its bout time
That I got time
Alone with you
'Cause you're so fine
When I get mine
Baby you can too
Keep breakin' you down
Down down down
So fine
Get mine
Baby you can too
You, you, you, you
Baby, baby you can too
So fine
Get mine
So fine
Get mine
Baby, baby you can tooEmbed
