THIS COULD BE US Lyrics
You ready?
Nah, you ain't ready
I mean ready for us
You know you want me like a new pair of shoes

This could be us
But you be playin'
This could be us
But you keep on foolin' around
You're the cage to my dove
I'm just saying
Forever and ever in love
Oh baby yeah, this could be us
You know you want me like a new pair of shoes

This could be us
This could be us

You, you say you ain't ready
Ready to go steady
Ain't ready for 'us' (no)
'Cause what I got make you weak in in the knees
Take your energy
Make you sleep for a week
Sex with me ain't enough
That's why we gotta do it metaphysically
This could be us
This could be us
This could be us
This could be us

I, I know you're loving your freedom
'Cause yo freedom (freedom) is payin' yo bills
Yes it is
Boyfriends, you think you don't need 'em
But in the middle of the cold, cold night
I think you will
Sho' you right

This could be us (yes!)
But u b playin' (oh yeah)
This could be us (you sho' nuff could be)
But you keep on foolin' around

We, we come up on a crossroad
And we got to decide (decide)
Which way to turn
Which way to turn
Are we gonna go (Are we gonna go)
Go (Are we gonna)
Over the bridge, over the bridge (over the bridge)
Before, before it burns
Don't you let it burn, let it burn, baby
This could be us
This could be us
Oh yeah
This could be us
Oh you gotta stop playing, baby

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That a woman needs L-O-V-E love
Like a river flow, like a river flow (inside)
If its good that's all she thinking of
(Metaphysical cookie licking cream)
Sleep alone if you wanna
(nothing mystical, let me lick the kitty clean)
But like a new pair of shoes
(after that) You gonna wanna show me off to your friends
(You can put me on my back)
(Look for candy in my purple psychedelic pimp sack)
When I-- ooooohhh
This right here, this could be us

This could be us
This could be us
Oh yeah
This could be us
Oh you gotta stop playing' baby
This right here, this could be us
This could be
This could be us (oh yeah)
But you be playing (yes you do now)
This could be us (honey,honey, honey)
But you keep on foolin' around
See that you're the cage to me dove
I'm just saying (I'm just saying)
Forever and ever in love
Ooh baby yeah, this could be us

This could be us
This could be us
This could be
This could be us, us
This could be us
This could be us

Can't you see it baby
You're the cage to my dove
Only one I been dreaming of
Forever and ever in love
Ohh baby yeah
This could, this could be, this could be us
But you don't
Have
Time
For
Me
No
