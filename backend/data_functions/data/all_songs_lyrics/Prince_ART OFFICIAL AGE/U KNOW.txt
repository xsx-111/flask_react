U KNOW Lyrics
Put your hands together
No, like this
Surprise, surprise
Another treat, another trick
This is sweet, which one's which?

For the record let me state that I never had a reason to break contractual endeavour or sever a relationship with anyone I
Pleasure, pleasure
For the playa let me stop and say-ah that I only payed attention when I heard you mention that he tried to take your
Treasure, treasure
(Ohh no he didn't!)
(What then?)
And as a matter of fact I would have gave you back but then he had a heart attack when you made impact and said his shack without you would be
Better, better
(See what I really mean, uhh, uhh)
But see what I really mean is that our future queen should never be in frustration with this rock and roll machine no, no, not
Ever, ever
(Yeah, huh, you know)
(What?)

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know
You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know
If you really wanna find the answer to this cancer
Then we must rewind
Then never mind the first opinion
(You better ask somebody else)
To run this game requires fame
Your soul and name and nothing gained
Unless it's sacrificed my dear it's only plain for His dominion
And any question of the deal is met with another demand to kneel and reprimand concealed allegations of your
Sinning, sinning
(Uhh, what's that all about?)
That's why I'm, I'm
Feminine rising, not surprising recognizing that the power of the breasts is just a test that you'll be
Winning, winning
(You got this, baby)

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know
You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know
There it is
Put your head down
Just, just know thyself, know thyself
Talk to him
Right

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know2Embed
