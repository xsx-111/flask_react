ART OFFICIAL CAGE Lyrics
Welcome home, Class
You've come a long way
(You've come a long way)
(You've come a long way)
Mine damer og herrer
Konger og dronninger og alt det midt imellem
Velkommen til timen
I skal til at gøre noget der vil forandre jeres liv for evigt
(Cage)
(Cage)
Åben det her bur
(Come on let's go)
(Free people, come on let's go)
(Free the people, free the people)

I woke up in the city in a bit of a rage
Determined to free my mind from this art official cage
Taught by taught by teachers taught from an early age
A place in heaven far off in the future

(Come on let's go)
(Free the people, come on let's go)

Ghettos to the left of me, Mars to the right
Why's my kingdom come only in prayers at night
What should I expect if I'm not willing to fight
A place in heaven somewhere in the future

Louder than a bomb since the day of my birth
Got me second class when I got here first
Lovely score but how am I supposed to know what it's worth
Art official age in the future
Free the people, come on let's go
Starting from the top getting higher so
Never going back underwater, no
Brand new boogie without the hero
Sure Minneapolis get this, no
I'm going up Lady Liberty's dress and blow, blow, blow
