WAY BACK HOME Lyrics
... any person or object, what so ever that requires your attention, is something that has veered from its path and preordained destiny of total enlightenment

Never wanted
A typical life
Scripted role
Huh, trophy wife
All I ever wanted, to be left alone
See my beds made up at night 'cause in my dreams I roam
Just trying to find
Trying to find

My way back
Back home

So many reasons why
(There's so many reasons why)
I don't belong here
But now that I am I
(Without fear I am)
Gonna conquer with no fear

Until I
(Until I)
Find
(I find my)
My
(My way back)
Way back home
Until I
(Until I)
Find
(I find my)
My
(My way back)
Way back home
(Find my way back home)

Most people in this world
(Most of the people in this world)
Are born dead
But I was born alive
(I was born with this dream)
Dream outside my head (outside my head)

That I
(Until I)
Could find my
(I find my)
My
(My way back)
Way back home
My
(Until I)
My
(I find my)
Way
(My way back)
Way back home
Is this the way?
Power to the ones:
Power to the ones who can raise a child like me
The path is set, but if you look the truth will set us free
I've heard about those happy endings, but it's still a mystery
Let me tell you about me
I'm happiest

When I can see
(Until I)
(I find my)
(My way back)
My way back home
Can you see
(Until I)
(I find my)
(My way back)
My way back, my way back, homeEmbed
