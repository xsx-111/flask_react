WHAT IT FEELS LIKE Lyrics
Been a couple hundred hours since he got your call
You used to treat me like David, but now I feel like Saul
Been making it rain all around the world
What difference does it make when the boy ain't got his girl?

This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe

Your name's not David and it sure ain't Saul
Maybe you have no business writing on my wall
Springtime on the Philistines before the middle of the fall
(Middle of the fall)
Silly rabbit needs to stop doin' tricks if you wanna get my call
(If you wanna get my call)

This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
Everybody goes up and down in a lifetime love affair
Makin' up, just to break it up
And pullin' each other's hair
What I wouldn't give to have you right here next to me
Show you what I really feel about you
We'll kiss and you will see

This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe

The art of seduction
You and me is the right equation
And all you need to reach my lovin'
Is "Pi R Squared" and a muffin
I can't wait to be your baby
Baby, here I am
Just take me
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babeEmbed
