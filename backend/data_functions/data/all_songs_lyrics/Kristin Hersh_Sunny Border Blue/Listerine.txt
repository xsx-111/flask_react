Listerine LyricsListerine covers your tracks
Doesn't do shit for the facts
I'm lying on the couch
Scary memories fill my mouth
How did I love a breaking thing?
How did I sleep through a kidnapping?
How'd I trust a band who'd leave me one by one?
I only wanted the spark
I only wanted your hearts
It's hard
It's hard and stupid
I'm the one who let you do it
I only wanted the high
Wasn't much more to my life
I couldn't wait to come down
There's nothing here but the groundEmbed
