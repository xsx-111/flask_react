Silica LyricsLet the ache out
Spread it around
You want to fly him in
You want him
Play a grownup
'Til you grow up
If you could you would
I swallowed some bad voodoo
Caught it in the gut
Wish you were here
Wish I was not
You hear someone wanting you
How can I fume
Then be bursting with kindness?
A gracious cocoon in the shadows
We're in good company
Us lefty Lucy's
Play a grownup
'Til you grow up
If you could you would
This is a touch prayer
Praying for you
Wish you were here
Wish I was too
Come see how okay we are
Come see how okay we can be
Picture her Silica
Lifting her shirt to the sun
Cherry neck sea
Easy nowEmbed
