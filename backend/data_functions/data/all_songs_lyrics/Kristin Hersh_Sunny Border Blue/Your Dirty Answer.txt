Your Dirty Answer LyricsYou know how it feels when the real world encroaches
Rubbing elbows with the unemployed and you
You're so beautiful
You're so rude
Peeling mangos on a fold out couch
I'm scooped out
You're inscrutable
You're all mine
Swimming is a 'lude
Wine opens your mind
Your guitar's a race car
Sex is your best friend
What's your dirty answer?
My fantasies are unlived histories
You know what it's like when mistakes go unmade
It was beautiful
It was you
I'm giving up the ugly
I thought you'd make pretty
I'll be goddamned
This is beautiful
Hold my hand
Swimming is a 'lude
Wine opens your mind
Your guitar's a race car
Sex is your best friend
What's your dirty answer ?
I don't judge people
I just watch them 'til it's time to look away
I want to look away now
Somebody's coming
I don't want to live backwards
I don't want to even look backwards
It's not my fault
It's not my fault you don't love me
It's not my fault you don't love me
When I'm drunk
I'm wiped
I'm so tired
Carry me for a little whileEmbed
