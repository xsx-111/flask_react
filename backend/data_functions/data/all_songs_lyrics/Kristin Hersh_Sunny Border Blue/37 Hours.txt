37 Hours LyricsBy now, I should know where you're going
By now I should but I don't
You're better off wherever you are off to
Agile or stoned
By now, I should wake you when I'm hungry
Right now I should but I'm not
We could be a silkworm tightrope
We could but we're not
I don't want this to be over
You're what I do
Every day the only thing
That makes any sense
Your liver twisting logic's
Far and away the smartest thing
I don't know where I am
Plus I don't know when I am
'cause you insist on using fucked up military time
'cause you are better off alone
I've been right here for 37 hours
I dropped a cigarette in my shoe
And dove in the water
Then I swam until my hair dreaded
Like flying on fire
That day I quit smoking and swimming
I heard some advice from above
Ducking under cramming it in
Isn't falling in love
I don't want this to be over
You're what I do
Everyday the only thing
That makes any sense
Your liver twisting logic
Far and away the smartest thing
I don't know where I am
Plus I don't know when I am
'cause you insist on using f**ked up military time
'cause you are better off alone
I've been right here for 37 hoursEmbed
