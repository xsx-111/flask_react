Ruby LyricsEverybody was so pretty there
And up and jumping around
And easy it's easy to sleep
With idiots and prophets
Leaves me wondering
Ruby or iridescent cough drop?
This baby's like a winter bird, raunchy and sweet
With snowflakes melting in his hair
The boys are supermen
Wondering
Ruby or iridescent cough drop?
You're the great convincer, should I do this, am I good?
You can smell a fever, shold I do this, am I good?
Let's dive
All the way down
The two of us are old paint
My grandmother's horse
Still alive, still kicking, not allowed to work
'Til we become beauty
A fluid mediumEmbed
