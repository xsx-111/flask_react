Flipside LyricsThere's always drooling zombies
Or at least one dick
I'm having trouble focusing
Cause all I see in front of me is
You when we're finally alone
He was the bone king
Dead to all the world
Maybe dead's like being
Really high without the low
But I enjoy the hangovers here
I could see them on the flip-side of a molecule
But I have all the energy I can take for now
Holy floating
We're holy floating
Holy floating
Holy shit, I think I'd rather be on the ground than flying
We're still fucking up in a healthy way for now
How dare you save my life
Then try to break my heart
You make alone so goddamn lonely
Makes me want to fall in love with
Everything and float above the ground
These days I do the same thing
Commit the same damn crime
If I'm not feeling out the flipside
Maybe I'm supposed to be here
Maybe you're supposed to be here too
I could see them on the flip-side of a molecule
But I have all the energy I can take for now
Holy floating
We're holy floating
Holy floating
Holy shit, I think I'd rather be on the ground than flying
We're still fucking up in a healthy way for now
And my feet don't touch the groundEmbed
