Spain LyricsFour days in Spain
Smoky Spain
And I take off again
Then I take off again, smiling back
The engine is idling
And the car seems to be expanding
Weird
Blindfolded kissing
Looking for the truth in your tiny moves
I hate to lose
Four days in Spain
Spooky Spain
And you're my missing thing:
Too sweet and pointless
Complete and somewhere else
I was sick of being asked
I didn't want to to anyways
Sucking down mother's milk
Singing my throat away
It's not an awful secret, you know
It's just a secret
Spitting out your blue gum
Kissing your breath away
I wanted you to sleep with her and
Hate yourself instead of me
I wanted you untrue
Hating yourself like me
After all, what am I missing
I haven't missed before
Sucking down the precious lies
I should have swallowed way before?Embed
