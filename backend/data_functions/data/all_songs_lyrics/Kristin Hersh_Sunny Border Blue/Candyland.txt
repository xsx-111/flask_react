Candyland LyricsI lost a boy
And now I look for him
Through every window
And behind every door
My son went down
This isn't trauma
It's not even drama anymore
I was born
With a sad song in my mouth
He gave me a reason to sing it
It's like this boy
Took all my clear cold nights
Left me hot and dry
And when he falls
I can't hear it
This isnt vodka
It's not even chocolate
I don't know how long I can stay straight
And still see straight
He gave me a reason to say it
Don't wait for pain
To find out you exist
Don't look for shame
You're better off without it
Life is unkind
This isn't candyland
I know you don't understand
So nice not to be ashamed
So nice not to be creeped out
Ice is unkind
'Till it freezes your enemies
Life is unkind
'Till it burns up your memories
Life is unkind
He gave me a reason
To live itEmbed
