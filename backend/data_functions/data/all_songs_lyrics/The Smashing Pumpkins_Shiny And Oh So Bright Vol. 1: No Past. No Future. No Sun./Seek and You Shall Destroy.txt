Seek and You Shall Destroy Lyrics
If gods are strong
And cities fraught
Then how am I still here?
In fits and starts
Speak underground
Let's kid with hidden mirrors

Yes, I'm strange
Now I'm breaking off for other worlds
So it's an evening's drill
Disabused by her
And magazine

Seek and you shall destroy me
Seek and you shall destroy me
To faces form, a victor's sonnet
To faces, our night comes
To an early close, in miniature of stark
And sweet repose

Sling and arrow's kite, a priestly psyche
Yet here lies Calvary
By telescopic art, and mason's mark
In aperture, drums asleep
To those undaunted, those unwanted
Lost as well as wrought
You're in a tranquil spot
Turning, turning to nowhere

Seek and you shall destroy me
Seek and you shall destroy me
So libertine climb, and brigantine sign
The Elohim for peace
Seek and you shall destroy, you shall destroy me
Seek and you shall destroy, you shall destroy me
Oh, mystic blackguards, go with glass hearts
And brace with better shieldEmbed
