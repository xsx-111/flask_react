Knights of Malta LyricsWoah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna make this happen
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
I'm gonna fly forever
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna ride that rainbow
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
Find that open road
Catch that blazing star
And climb out of that hole
To wonder where we are
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna make this happen
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
I'm gonna fly forever
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna ride that rainbow
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
Where omens scar your door
Like a harvest
We're bound and set for war
But no soldier comes
A serpent for your fist
And a scarab for your mouth
The symptoms say persist
So resist
But a cure is not in doubt
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna make this happen
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
I'm gonna fly forever
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna ride that rainbow
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
You'll just rise on forever
As my halo shines in you
When doldrums age in platinum
I've a starship you can use
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna make this happen
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
I'm gonna fly forever
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna ride that rainbow
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
I'm gonna fly forever
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna make this happen
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
I'm gonna fly forever
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna ride that rainbow
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, woah
We're gonna make this happen
I'm gonna fly forever
We're gonna ride that rainbow1Embed
