Solara LyricsBurn down the sun
I’m not everyone
High and dry
Nothing but a body in my mind
I’m here to stay
They're here today
High and dry
Nothing but a body in my mind
I’m nothing but a body in my mind
I feel that something ain’t right
No fear but reasons that I can’t cite
Tear down the sun
Bring down the sun
I’m not everyone
I’m not everyone
I’m not everyone
Unholy sin
Unholy fate
High and dry
Nothing but a body in my mind
I’m left to ash
Not here but past
High and dry
Nothing but a body in my mind
I am nothing but a body in my mind
I feel that something ain’t right
No fear but reasons that I can’t cite
Tear down the sun
Bring down the sun
I'm not everyone
I'm not everyone
I'm not everyone
Burn down the sun
Speculation
Come on, get yourself together
Speculation
Become the owl at midnight
Situation
I am the seer, I am the seeker
Situation
Become the one that fights you
Become the one that fights you
Become the owl at midnight
Become the owl at midnight
High and dry
I'm ash made time
With sun, too bright
I am nothing but a body in my mind
I am nothing but a body in my mind
Tear down the sun
Bring down the sun
I’m not everyone
I’m not everyone
Burn down the sun2Embed
