Travels Lyrics
See love, see time
See death, see life
See tears, see bright
See day from night
See pulse, see tomb
See breath, see moon
See sun, see stars
See God, see ours

It's where I belong
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
But it's far from here, or else I'm gone
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
But it's far from here, or else I'm gone

See eyes, see shine
See seas, see mine
See shadows wind
See ripple, see blind
See you, see me
See destiny
See knots untied
See knots that bind
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
But it's far from here, or else I'm gone
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
But it's far from here, or else I'm gone

So run out where the thunder stuck
And star house-sized takes you up
And whirlpool light swirls you underneath
Rhapsodies sell a riptide fight
And panoramas of the sunset light
Yet Heaven's faithful servant's still your dream

See love, see time
See death, see life
See tears, see bright
See day from night

It's where I belong
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
But it's far from here, or else I'm gone
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
But it's far from here, or else I'm gone
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
But it's far from here, or else I'm gone
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
It's where I belong
But it's far from here, or else I'm goneEmbed
