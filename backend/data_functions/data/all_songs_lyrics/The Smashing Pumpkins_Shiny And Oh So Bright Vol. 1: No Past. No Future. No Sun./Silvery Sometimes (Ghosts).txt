Silvery Sometimes (Ghosts) Lyrics
Blur like a rocket
Torch like a dying sun
Snap like a dragon
Dive like a pelican
Kingdoms of my kingdom come
Skip like a prophet
Spit like a poet’s gun
But say how long can this go on?

Stumbling before you speak
Stunning and stunning and stunning the black
You turn turncoat
Inward to seek out all your hopes
It's your signals
That hurts me most

We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
Rule like a tyrant
Make like a valentine
Tear like a siren
Sulk like a sunken mine
Kingdoms of my kingdom come
It’s all but one, so
Row like a felon
Drown like a captain's son
But say how long can this go on?

We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts

Stumbling before you speak
Stunning and stunning with cannons to lead
And tigers tight
You scan the fields, someone dies tonight
It’s tragic, but at least it’s not you
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
