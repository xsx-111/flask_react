Alienation Lyrics
To say there goes my wishing tree
I then chose this outer space
And the idyllic swing on which I’d swung from
Exchanged for apparent disgrace
All hail, there’s no spinning back
From an orbit laid in vain
From this empire man cannot name

Alienation, alienation
Free the morning, free revelation
Alienation
Oh, of thee I sing

For every one of you
There dwells a trillion stars
As with any true regret
Truth gets dumped by charge
Which deigns how I’ve arrived
Via an old, archaic slingshot

Alienation, alienation
Free the morning, free revelation
Alienation, alienation
Mourn the movement, fear penetration
Alienation
Oh, of thee I sing
Yet I sing, how does a wishing tree run dry
Cherished in remembrance in my mind
The embrace of those who loved you cannot die
Safe beyond the regents and their hives
Safe from clench of jackals and plus nine cries
Never yielding

For every one of you
There dwells a trillion stars
Lighting way from truth to absolute
Truth gets dumped by charge
Which deigns how I’ve arrived
As one atom
Which is but a grain of sand
And those loves are never forgotten
In merry time
Home is where you start
And end your days
Alienation

Alienation, alienation
Free the morning, free revelation
Alienation, alienation
Mourn the movement, fear penetration
Alienation
Oh, of thee I sing
Of thee I sing
Of thee I sing
Of thee I sing
Of thee I sing
Of thee I sing
Of thee I singEmbed
