With Sympathy Lyrics
I've seen enough, it's all undone
'Tis the secret of the Irishman
Weak makes strong
And strong makes weak
Oh, seraphim, do come

For the love of irony
Let's love, oh let's love
For the love of irony
She's laughing on, she's laughing on
To stay confused
Disunion has its breaks
Its ordinary aches and pains, I'll take

It's with sympathy
That I gift you to me

Please, stay confused
Disunion has its use
Its sadness, dead goons, and pageants of harm
For the love of irony
Let's love, oh let's love
It's with sympathy
That I gift you to me
It's with sympathy
That I gift you to meEmbed
