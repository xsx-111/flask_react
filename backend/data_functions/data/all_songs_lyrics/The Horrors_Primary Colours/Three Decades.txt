Three Decades Lyrics
Three decades in canada and now you plan
To leave your home and lead a life more valiant
Feather white, she occupies the virgin berth
Climb to her as if there were no barriers

Don't give up, stand tall, this is your hour
Full of joy, the boy within must try

Forget your regrets
Cavernous imagery grips your mind
Don't let your fear dictate your life
Forget your regrets
Don't lose your purpose, this is your hour
Feather white, before your hand she lies
