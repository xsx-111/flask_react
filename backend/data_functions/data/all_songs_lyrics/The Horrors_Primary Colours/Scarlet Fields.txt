Scarlet Fields Lyrics
As the summer fades away
You'll lead me to the garden
Passing the lovers
Swooning in the autumn

See yourself
Your image in the eyes of someone else
See yourself
Your fears as they appear to someone else

When the sun sets
On dark silhouettes
Collapse into dream
Collapse into dream
Collapse into dream

As summer fades away
Laugh at my reflection
Passed to a lover
Seeking your affection


Though i know
You won't be here for long
Though i know
You won't be here for long 
Though i know
You won't be here for long1Embed
