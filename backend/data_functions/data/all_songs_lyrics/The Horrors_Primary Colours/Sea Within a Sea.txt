Sea Within a Sea LyricsSome say we walk alone
Barefoot on wicked stone no light
And sanctuary found
Never waits around awhile
Marching to the sea
Their dreams stay in the shadows
Their dreams stay firmly rooted in the shallows
See the scraping sky
See my destination
See my destination there tonight
So say I walk alone
Barefoot on wicked stone tonight
Will you leap to follow
Will you turn and go
Will your dreams stay rooted in the shallows
See the scraping sky
Far beyond the shallows
Far beyond the reaches of the shadows
(Joshua Hayward's Guitar Solo)
(Begin Synthesizer Cascades)
Though youth may fade with boyhood's cares
New fear will catch us unawares
I know it will, I know it will
I know it will, I know it will
So you might say the path we share
Is one of danger and of fear
Until the end, until the end
Until the end, until the end
(Synthesizer intensifies, cymbals crash, Faris wails)6Embed
