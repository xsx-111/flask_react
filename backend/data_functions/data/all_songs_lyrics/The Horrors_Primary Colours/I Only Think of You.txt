I Only Think of You Lyrics
It's so lonely coming down
It's a long, long wait around
It's a hollow, hollow day
It's a long, long, long, long way, way down
Fair and feather white
Lying in false paradise
I found you on your side
Weighed down
Don't go
Cause you know I will follow
You know
If I lose you I'll go mad

It's so lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lonely coming down
It's so lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lonely coming down

As the flames wash around me
I only think of you
I only want to save you
But I've done all I can do
To the end I would defend you
In heaven I'd suspend you
I only want to save you
I only want the truth

Don't ask
Cause you knew this could never last
You were always going too fast
You were always going too fast

To the death I would defend you
With my life I will protect you
I know I'm gonna save you
I'll do all I can do
Alone I'll beat the flames down
I will defend your name
I'll descend through the fire
I will carry you home

I will carry you home 1Embed
