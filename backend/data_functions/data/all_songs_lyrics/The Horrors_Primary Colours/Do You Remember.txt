Do You Remember Lyrics
Say to her, say to her
Can you remember the first time we met?
Don't you remember the first caress?
Waiting there, waiting there
Standing alone on the corner in the night
Can you remember the first time?

But if you wait
But if you wait
I will open to you
I will be with you
And if you wait
And if you wait
I will cross the ocean
I will be with you soon

Say to her, say to her
Can you remember the night that you left?
Scanning the crowd out in the square

But if you wait
But if you wait
I will take your hand
And you'll understand
And if you wait
And if you wait
I will be with you soon
I'll cross the ocean blue
Do you remember?

And if you wait
And if you wait
I will come by night
And i'll be by your side
And if you wait
And if you wait
If you don't remember
You will remember soonEmbed
