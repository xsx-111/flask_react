New Ice Age Lyrics
The agony and the harm is critical
Through a frosted stopwatch
Time is ticking
Tick tick tick tick dead
A new ice age
Closer day by day
Will freeze
When ice wings are swooping down

There'll never be a new ice age like this one
How we need it now
Ice will make a thousand sculptures
And ice will spit them out

Ice hits the medicine counter
Ice knock the sniper down
Ice spoils the cocoa powder
Ascends to the frozen crown
C-c-c
The saturation
The agony

Ice-spit-out
Ice-spit-out
Ice shocks a sleeping system
Ice hits the dead-beat bar
Ice hits the faceless enemies
Ice strikes the cowering clowns
C-c-c-c
A new ice age
The coldest days
Will come
Welcome to the ice age
