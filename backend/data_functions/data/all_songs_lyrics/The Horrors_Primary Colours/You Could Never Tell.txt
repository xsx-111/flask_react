You Could Never Tell LyricsWe sat in the Half-Light
I didn't know what to say
Oh you could never tell
Why I do these things
Why did I do these things
I knew I wouldn't want to know
I have betrayed myself
For something poor and shallow
She was talking about
Something she heard
She was talking about
Something she heard
She was talking about
Something she heard
She was talking about
Something she heard
Finally I'm closing in
On what I have been chasing
But as the moment comes
It's just by expectation
Ice wings of paradise
The sky will try to follow
That first kiss you had
Will curse all your tomorrows
She was talking about
Something she heard
She was talking about
Something she heard
She was talking about
Something she heard
She was talking about
Something she heard
Is it any wonder
I easily find her
I stand by the fountain
When I call she answers
Though I say
No I don't know
You're right
She was talking about
Something she heard
She was talking about
Something she heard
She was talking about
Something she heard
She was talking about
Something she heard
Something she heard
Something she heard
Something she heard
Something she heard
Something she heardEmbed
