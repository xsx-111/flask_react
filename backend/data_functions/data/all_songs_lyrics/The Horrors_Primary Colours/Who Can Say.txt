Who Can Say Lyrics
I never meant for you to get hurt
And how I try, oh how i try
I could never give you just what you deserve
Another man would surely learn
I know these words may only serve to twist the knife
But I'll strive to make them heard
Maybe it's better now I've gone away
Maybe it's not, oh who can say

And though it's hard for me to say
I know you're better off this way

And when I told her i didn't love her anymore
She cried
And when i told her her kisses were not like before
She cried (She cried)
And when i told her another girl had caught my eye
She cried
And then i kissed her with a kiss
That could only mean goodbye

And though it's hard for me to say
Maybe you're better off this way
And though it's hard for me to say
I know you're better off this way
Get away!
Get away!
Get away!
Get away!
Get away!
Get away!Embed
