Family Tree LyricsI tell you now that I don't understand
Why everybody gives a big hi-damn
Oh where I'm going to
Don't mean a thing to you
I see you sitting in your masquerade
I'd love to pour you some of my lemonade
And get it off alright
We're caught in an early night
I know you hate me so, but I ain't gonna go
I'm staying here all right
I am your family tree
I know your A-Z
This is a secret proposition lay your hands on me
Nothing to talk about, darlin', it's all make believe
I see your hands are shaking but my heart is breaking me down
Its a pretty day and I'm gonna get alright
I lost my head and you ain't nowhere in sight
I see you got it all wrong
I got no calls on my phone
I just keep holding out, until I find a doubt
That you ain't coming home
I am your family tree
I know your A-Z
This is a secret proposition lay your hands on me
Not gonna talk about darlin', its so neighbourly
I see your hands are shaking but my heart is breaking me down
I am your family tree
I know your A-Z
This is a secret proposition lay your hands on me
Not gonna talk about darlin', its so neighbourly5Embed
