Supersoaker Lyrics
My motivation has gone too soon
Good vibrations all over you
Act like you mean it, you mean it
You've got a story you never tell
Down in the delta I'm ringing bells
I've never seen it, seen it
Back of my mind I'm on my way
I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it, believe it

'Cause I'm a supersoaker red, white
And blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

The flags are flying across the plains
I've got a secret picking at my brain
I wanna see you, see you
The exit sign is on my face
Don't know my home, I don't know my place
I just wanna be there, be there
'Cause I'm a supersoaker red, white
And blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
I just lay it on the line, on the line

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, ooh19Embed
