Beautiful War Lyrics
Bite your tongue
Don't make a scene, dear
Everybody's been here least once before
We've been here more
Your heart breaks
Rolls down the window
I've seen it all go, come back around
And I've heard the sound

The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs is doing my head in
I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."
It's a beautiful war

When I hold
The warmth of your body
There is nobody that I'd rather hold
Shattered and cold

The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs is making me crazy
I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."
It's a beautiful war
I say, "Love, love â€“ it don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
I say, "Love, love..."
I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."
I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."

It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war13Embed
