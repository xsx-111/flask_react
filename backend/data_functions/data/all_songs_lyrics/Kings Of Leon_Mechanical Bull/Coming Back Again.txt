Coming Back Again Lyrics
Ros√© wine and a skinny cigarette
Locks fall down your neck
I saw you right before your eyes caught mine
Better than the rest

I can feel it coming back again
I got a feeling coming back again
And you got me on the ropes
Yeah, you got me on the ropes again
And I can feel it coming back again
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh

Careless hands and grimace hides a smile
Face of closing time
I'm not much for talking
Until I'm pushed aside
Then I speak just fine

And I can feel it coming back again
I got a feeling coming back again
And now you got me on the ropes
Yeah, you got me on the ropes again
And I can feel it coming back again
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh
I can feel it coming back again, oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back, oh
And I can feel it coming back again, oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh
I can feel it coming back, oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh1Embed
