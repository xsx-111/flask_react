Work on Me Lyrics
Rise and shine
Get on your way
By the look in your eyes there's nothing to say
I got it all
In my hands
And I know that you know just where I stand
Where I stand

One more thing
Before you go
Pick it up and then I'll hit it on down the road
I got no time
For playing games
I'm in and I'm out and it's always the same
It's always the same

Ooh, I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
It's all coming back to me
Oh, what a shame
If it's all the same
I'll get my coat and leave
No way you're going to work
No way you're going to work
No way you're going to work on me
I said it before
I'll open the door
Why is that so hard to believe?
Pick that guitar
Up in the air
Cut loose and then let down that hair
I know that you were born to shine
You gotta shine before you blow 'em away
You blow 'em away

Ooh, I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
It's all coming back to me
Oh, what a shame
If it's all the same
I'll get my coat and leave
No way you're going to work
No way you're going to work
No way you're going to work on me
I said it before
I'll open the door
Why is that so hard to believe?

Get on your way
Get on your way
Get on your way
Get on your way
I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
Get on your way
Oh, what a shame
If this is all the same
Get on your way
No way you're going to work
No way you're going to work
Get on your way
I told you before
I open the door
Get on your way
Get on your way3Embed
