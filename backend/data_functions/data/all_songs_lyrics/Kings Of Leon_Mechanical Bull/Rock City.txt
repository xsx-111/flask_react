Rock City Lyrics
I was running through the desert
I was looking for drugs
And I was searching for a woman
Who was willing to love
So I could take her like a woman
Yeah take her like a woman
I was looking for a bad girl
Looking for a bad boy
Someone who could take all the night away
Oh baby I could shake it like a woman
Yeah shake it like a woman
I got the eyes on me of a jealous man
And if you're looking to run
Well then you've already ran
I break down like a woman
I break down like a woman

I go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her
Everyone believes me

I've been several miles and plenty more
And I found myself face-first on the floor
Searching for something
But never finding something
And I don't know where I belong
I'm just trying to get myself back home
And get a little work
Yeah find my little woman
And I go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her
Everyone believes me

Oh my my, oh my my, oh my my
I need to find something
I'm searching for something

I go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her
Everyone believes me
I go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her
Everyone believes me
