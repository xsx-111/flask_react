Last Mile Home LyricsTake it back I never meant it
Never thought that it would come to pass
Baby know it's not forgotten
Baby know that this is gonna last
By large I had it coming
I recall the tremble in your eye
I just want to make it better
I just want to make it right
Tripping on the last mile home
Tripping on the last mile home
People are always better
When we're all together
I'm tripping on the last mile home
Tell me that the bar is drinking
And the lies are swinging in the smoke
I'm a fool for conversation
And I've got nowhere to go
Tripping on the last mile home
I'm tripping on the last mile home
Things are always better
When we're all together
I'm tripping on the last mile home
Tripping on the last mile home
Tripping on the last mile home
Things are always better
When we're all together
I'm tripping on the last mile home
Tripping on the last mile home
Tripping on the last mile home
Things are always better
When we're all together
I'm tripping on the last mile home
I'm tripping on the last mile home
Tripping on the last mile home
Things are always better
When we're all together
I'm tripping on the last mile home
Maybe I'm the one who's broken
Maybe I'm the breaker of the heart
Been so low since we've spoken
It's been lonely, baby it's been hard2Embed
