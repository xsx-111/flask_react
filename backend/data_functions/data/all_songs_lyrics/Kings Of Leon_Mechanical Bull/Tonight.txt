Tonight LyricsTonight, somebodies lover
Is gonna pay for a sin
It's coming out, it's coming out
I don't know, just what is leading me
Or if time is on my side
It's coming out, it's coming out
I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange and
It's something along the way
It's something along the way
When I see, lights on Broadway
I know it's gonna be a long night
It's coming out, It's coming out
I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange and
It's something along the way
It's something along the way
A war in my head, I can feel it all
The neon lights my way
There's something along the way
There's something along the way
Tonight, I'm gonna leave my body
Tonight, I'm gonna leave my body
Tonight, somebody's lover is gonna pay for his sin
It's coming out, It's coming out
I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange
And it's something along the way
Something along the way
A war in my head, I can feel it all
The neon lights my way
There's something along the way
There's something along the way
Tonight, I'm gonna leave my body
Tonight, I'm gonna leave my body5Embed
