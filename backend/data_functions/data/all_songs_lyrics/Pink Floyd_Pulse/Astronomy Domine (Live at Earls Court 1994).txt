Astronomy Domine (Live at Earls Court 1994) Lyrics

Lime and limpid green
A second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan
Stars can frighten


Lime and limpid green, the sounds surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds surrounds
The icy waters undergroundEmbed
