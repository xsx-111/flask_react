Biological Lyrics
Thousands of hairs, two eyes only, it's you
Some skin, billions of genes, again it's you
XX XY, that's why it's you and me
Your blood is red, it's beautiful genetic love

Biological, I don't know why I feel that way with you
Biological, I need your DNA
Biological, I don't know why I feel that way with you
Biological, I need your DNA

Your fingerprints, the flesh around your bones
I'd like to know why all these things move me
Let's use ourselves to be as one tonight
A part of me would like to travel in your veins

Biological, I don't know why I feel that way with you
Biological, I need your DNA
Biological, I don't know why I feel that way with you
Biological, I need your DNAEmbed
