Venus Lyrics
You could be from Venus
I could be from Mars
We would be together
Lovers forever
Care for each other

You could live in the sea
And I could be a bird
We would be together
Lovers forever
Care for each other

If you were an illusion
I would make it real
We would be together
Lovers forever
Care for each other

If you walk in the sun
I will be your shadow
We would be together
Lovers forever
Care for each otherEmbed
