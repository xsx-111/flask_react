Run Lyrics
Holy girl, don't get up for running
Stay with me, I feel sad
When you run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run...

Sands of time are lying on my chest
Stay in bed, I feel sad
When you run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run...

Stay like this, on the hills of my chest
Don't wake up, I feel strange
When you go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go...

Stop the night, hold me tight, holy girl
Don't stand up, I feel strange
When you go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go....Embed
