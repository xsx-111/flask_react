Surfing on a Rocket Lyrics
Time for flying rockets
For silver jets
For surfing bombs

Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket

Don't, don't pray to go
Please take my hand
Don't get me down

Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
I'll be back one day
Just pray for me
I'm on my way

Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket
Surfing on a rocket

Five four three two one zero
No one can stop me to go
You'll never see me again
Five four three two one zero
No one can stop me to go
You'll never see me again2Embed
