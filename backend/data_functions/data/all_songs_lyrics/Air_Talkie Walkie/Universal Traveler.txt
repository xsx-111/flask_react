Universal Traveler Lyrics
I know so many
Places in the world
I follow the sun
In my silver plane

Universal traveler, universal traveler
Universal traveler, universal traveler

If you have a look
Outside on the sea
Everything is white
It's so wonderful

Universal traveler, universal traveler
Universal traveler, universal traveler

So far, so far
So far away

I met so many
People in my life
I've got many friends
Who can care for me
Universal traveler, universal traveler
Universal traveler, universal traveler

Just feel everywhere
At home, tomorrow
Is a brand new day
Let's go somewhere else

Universal traveler, universal traveler
Universal traveler, universal traveler

So far, so far
So far away2Embed
