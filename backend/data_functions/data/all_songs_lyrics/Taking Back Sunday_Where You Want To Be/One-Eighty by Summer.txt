One-Eighty by Summer Lyrics
Go on, just say it
You need me like a bad habit
One that leaves you defenseless, dependent, and alone
Are you afraid to say what you want to, tell me you want to?
Go on, just say it
You need me like a bad habit
One that leaves you defenseless, dependent, and alone
Are you afraid to say what you want to, tell me you want to?

Well, I hold my tongue, use it to assess
The damage from way back when it mattered
But nothing seems important anymore
We’re just protecting ourselves from our self
And I don’t think I’ll ever come back down
I don’t think I’ll ever come back down
I don’t think I’ll ever come back down
I don’t think I’ll ever come back down
I don’t think I’ll ever come back down
I don’t think I’ll ever come back
I don’t think I’ll ever come back

Are you ashamed to say what you want to, tell me you want to?
Are you ashamed to say what you want to, tell me you want to?
Go on, just say it
Are you ashamed to say what you want to, tell me you want to?
(Go on, just say it)
(Go on, just say it)
Are you ashamed to say what you want to, tell me you want to?
(Go on, just say it)
(Go on, just say it)
I’m making the difference
It just seems pointless
With all the obvious lines got out of focus
Why can’t you just be happy?
Why can’t you just be happy?
And I don’t think I’ll ever come back down
I don’t think I’ll ever come back down
I don’t think I’ll ever come back down
I don’t think I’ll ever come back down
I don’t think I’ll ever come back down
I don’t think I’ll ever come back
I don’t think I’ll ever come back

(Just come back)
Go on, just say it
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
Go on, just say it
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
Well, I’ll just say it
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
I’ll just say it
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
I need you defenseless, dependent, and alone
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
She says "Live up to your first impression"
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
Well, my best side was your worst invention
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
Why can't you live without the attention?
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
Why can't you live without the attention?
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
She says "Live up to your first impression"
(Just come back)
Well, my best side was your worst invention
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
Can't you live without the attention?
(Just come back)
(Just come back)
Why can't you live without the attention?
(Just come back)
She says "Live up to your first impression"
(I'll just say it)
Well, my best side was your worst invention
(I'll just say it)
Why can't you live without the attention?
(I need you defenseless, dependent, and alone)
Why can't you live without the attention?
She says "Live up to your first impression"
(I'll just say it)
Well, my best side was your worst invention
(I'll just say it)
Why can't you live without the attention?
(I need you defenseless, dependent, and alone)
Why can't you live without the attention?
Why can’t you live?
(Defenseless, dependent)
Why can't you live?
(Defenseless, dependent)
Why can’t you live without, live without?
(Defenseless, dependent)
(Defenseless, dependent)
Why can’t you live?
(Defenseless, dependent)
Why can’t you live?
(Defenseless, dependent)
Why can’t you live without, live without?
(Defenseless, dependent)
(Defenseless, dependent)5Embed
