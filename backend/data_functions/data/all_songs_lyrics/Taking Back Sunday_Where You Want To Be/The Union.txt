The Union Lyrics
I wait around for that "still small center"
From saint to sinner
Well, which one is it?
Just who do you think you are?
Just who do you think you are?
Well, who did you call to get this?
Well, is it who I think it is?
I swear to god I'm gonna kill him
Well, is it who I think it is?
You always knew it was on purpose
Yeah, "what's the point if it don't serve its purpose?"
"Splintered but focused", you're as good as gold
You're built from distraction, so brilliantly dull
I had a better friend in my worst of plans
I had a better friend
Than I ever had in either one of you

Well, I never made a scene
Well, they came to me
I never made a scene
I didn't have to
Well, they came to me
I didn't have to, I didn't have to
Well, I never made a scene
I didn't have to, I didn't have to
Well, I never made a scene
Ohhhh!
I always hoped to avoid the issues
(All the time)
Got me alone so I couldn't address you
(It will still speak for it itself)
Home is where you make it, love, don't get yourself confused
Besides what's it to you?
I traded in my conscience for your
For your confidence
(Conscience for your confidence)
Attacked my lungs with lies to pass the time
(Lungs with lies)
I made states move like regular days
(States move more like days)

I didn't have to, I didn't have to
Well, I never made a scene
I didn't have to, I didn't have to
Well, I never made a scene
I didn't have to, I didn't have to
Well, I never made a scene
I didn't have to, I didn't have to
Well, I never made a scene

I never made a scene
Well, they came to me
I never made a scene
Well, they came to me
I didn't have to, I didn't have to
Well, I never made a scene
I didn't have to, I didn't have to
Well, I never made a scene
I didn't have to, I didn't have to
Well, I never made a scene
I didn't have to, I didn't have to
Well, I never made a sceneEmbed
