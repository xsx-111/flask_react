Your Own Disaster Lyrics
Just think of this and me
As just a few of the many things
To lie around to clutter up your shelves
And I wish you weren't worth the wait
Because there's some thing's
I'd like to say to you

And I don't think that you know what you've been missing
Cause I don't think that you know what you've been missing

And I dare you to forget the marks you left
Across my neck from those nights
When we were both found at our best
Now I could make this obvious
And you, you could deny me all in one breath
You could shrug me off
Your shoulders

And I don't think that you know
I said I don't think you know
I said I don't think you know what your missing
Hey, lush, have fun
It's the weekend
Hey, lush, have fun
I don't think that
You know what
You've been missing
I don't think that
You know what
You've been missing

Just forget me
It's that simple
Just forget me
It's that simpleEmbed
