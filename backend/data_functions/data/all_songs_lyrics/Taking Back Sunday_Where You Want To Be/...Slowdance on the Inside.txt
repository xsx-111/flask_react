...Slowdance on the Inside Lyrics
Passed out in our school clothes
So we'd wake up in our Sunday's best
I never asked for your opinion, I just got it and I get it
You move slow like daytime drama
And I'm boring like his songs
So while I'm taking you for granted
We'll be humming along

Well cross my heart and hope to
I'm lying just to keep you here
So reckless (so reckless), so
So thoughtless (so thoughtless)
So careless, I could care less
Cross my heart and hope to
I'm lying just to keep you here
(So reckless)
Well she's so heartless
And I could care less

So paint your face up something elegant
And this town maybe a darker shade of red
Cause a long night means a fist fight
Against your pillow and my pearly whites
I want to hear you scream you like me better on my knees
So let us pray
(We don't believe in second chances)
So let us pray
Don't you ask me
Don't you move (anywhere)

Cross my heart and hope to
I'm lying just to keep you here
So reckless (so reckless), so
So thoughtless (so thoughtless)
So careless, I could care less
Cross my heart and hope to
I'm lying just to keep you here
(So reckless)
Well she's so heartless
And I could care less
Well cross my heart and hope to
I'm lying just to keep you here
(I'll keep you here, I'll keep you here)

One of us never did it but we're taking it all
And tell me why you never promised that you wanted it all
And her eyes never batted when she said it
It's a long night, open, know it
This glass house is burning down (open all night, know it)
You light the match, I'll stick around (open all night, know it)
I'll give you everything you want (open all night, know it)
And wish the worst of what I was (open all night, know it)
This glass house is burning down (open all night, know it)
You light the match, I'll stick around (open all night, know it)
I'll give you everything you want (open all night, know it)
And wish the worst of what I was (open all night, know it)
Tonight won't make a difference
Tonight won't make a difference
Tonight won't make a difference
Well tonight won't make a difference
Well tonight won't make a difference
Tonight won't make a difference
Tonight won't make a difference
Well tonight won't make a differenceEmbed
