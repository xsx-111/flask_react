Number Five with a Bullet Lyrics
We're gonna die like this, you know, miserable and old
Really gotta hand it to you, really gotta hand it to you
Are you positive? Absolutely sure?
Well, just get dressed, don't do this

Spent the night lit listening to Miles Davis
Said it makes you want to fall in love
Or be smart enough to keep your distance
You can't decide, you can't decide

We're gonna die like this, you know, miserable and old
Really gotta hand it to you, really gotta hand it to you
(And just so you know)
Are you positive?
(When we get home)
Absolutely sure?
(We're through)
Well, just get dressed, don't do this
(We're through)
Well just get dressed don't do this

It's a long way back South and to where I belong
Well, yeah, you've been there once or twice
And you still don't like it
I say you just never gave it a chance
(Well, give me a chance, give me a chance)
Besides, did you ever stop to think
That we can keep this up living like thieves?
But you can't decide, you can't decide
No, you can't decide, well, you can't decide
We're gonna die like this, you know, miserable and old
Really gotta hand it to you, really gotta hand it to you
(And just so you know)
Are you positive?
(When we get home)
Absolutely sure?
(We're through)
Well, just get dressed, don't do this
(We're through)
Well just get dressed don't do this

Are you positive? Absolutely sure? Are you positive?

We're gonna die like this, you know, miserable and old
Really gotta hand it to you, really gotta hand it to you
(And just so you know)
Are you positive?
(When we get home)
Absolutely sure?
(We're through)
Well, just get dressed, don't do this
(We're through)
Well just get dressed don't do this
We're gonna die like this, you know, miserable and old
Really gotta hand it to you, really gotta hand it to you
(And just so you know)
Are you positive?
(When we get home)
Absolutely sure?
(We're through)
Well, just get dressed, don't do this
(We're through)
Well just get dressed don't do this
We're gonna die like this
We're all hit or miss
And just in spite of it
We're gonna die like this
Miserable and old, and old2Embed
