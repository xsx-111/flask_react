Little Devotional Lyrics
Well I'm blowing smoke out of your window
And you're slippin' back into your dress
You know, you were always such a lady
I've always been impressed
But gentlemen, they don't ask questions
(We could laugh about it)
Just keep quiet, pay attention
(And you will show her, for)
Gentlemen, they don't ask questions
(We could laugh about it)
We could pay attention

I said, "I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers"
Said, "I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers"

Well, I pictured you in blue
But I have to say, I'm more partial to the red
Deep, dark, and devastating
Leaving no question as to where you've been
I calmed the crowd, by keeping quiet
Moved like a shadow, up to your mattress
Gentlemen don't ask questions
We could pay attention
Do you think he’d be better
'Cause we’re down for competition
At doing what I do best?
Do you think he’d be better
This could all be on purpose
At doing what I do best?

I said, "I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers"
Said, "I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers"

Do you think he'd be better
At doing what I do best?
Do you think he'd be better
At doing what I do best?
Do you think he’d be better
'Cause we’re down for competition
At doing what I do best?
Do you think he’d be better
This could all be on purpose
At doing what I do best?
I said, "I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers"
Said, "I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers"
I said, "I'm gonna have myself in shambles"
(Regardless)
"Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers"
Said, "I'm gonna have myself in shambles"
(If we knew)
"Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers"1Embed
