This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know) Lyrics
Well, I'll wait till you listen
I won't say a word
To 'follow your instincts'
Will just never work for me
Oh, silent but strong (yeah, I'm playing that card)
And you're noticing nothing again

Now I'm lying on the table
With everything you said
Keeping in mind the way that it felt
When the most I could do was to just blame myself
(yeah, I'm playing that card)
When the most I could do was to just blame myself

Well, I know you know everything
I know you didn't mean it
I know you didn't mean it
I know you know everything (drop everything)
I know you didn't mean it (start it all over)
I know you didn't mean it (remember more than you'd like to forget)

So we're talking forever
And you almost feel better
But better's no excuse for tonight
You see, itâ€™s never bad enough
To just leave or give up
But it's never good enough to feel right
Now I'm lying on the table
With everything you said
"It will all catch up eventually"
Well, it caught up and honestly
The weight of my decisions
Were impossible to hold
But they were never yours
They were never yours

Well, I know you know everything
I know you didn't mean it
I know you didn't mean it
I know you know everything (drop everything)
I know you didn't mean it (start it all over)
I know you didn't meant it (remember more then you'd like to forget)

Stop everything, start it all over
Remember more than you'd like to forget
Drop everything, start it all over
Remember more than you'd like to forget
Would you like to forget
Would you like to forget
Drop everything, start it all over
Well, drop everything start it all over (would you like to forget)
Drop everything start it all over
Start it all
Well I, know you know, everything
I know you didn't mean it
I know you didn't mean it
I know you know, everything (drop everything)
I know you didn't mean it (start it all over)
I know you didn't meant it (remember more then you'd like to forget)
I know you know
I know you know
I know you know
I know you know, you know, you know, you knowEmbed
