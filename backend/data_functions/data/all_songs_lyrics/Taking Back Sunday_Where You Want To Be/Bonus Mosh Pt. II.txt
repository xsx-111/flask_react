Bonus Mosh Pt. II Lyrics
So scream, I heard about your message
And how it reeked of your indifference
It bleeds horizontal straight from your wrists
(So scream louder now)
I'm bound to come around about
(Bound to come around)
But can’t you, can’t you feel it rolling off your lips
Tensing up your shoulders, c’mon, say it is

Well, it's love, make it hurt, I deserve it
Well, it's love, make it hurt, I deserve it
Well, it's love, it's love, it's love, make it hurt

I said I used the inconsistencies that undress the machine
You're the poster boy, their selling point
The focus for their new campaign
"Something has to be done"
I'm bound to come around about
Can’t you, can’t you feel it rolling off your lips
Tensing up your shoulders, c’mon

Well, it's love, make it hurt, I deserve it
Well, it's love, make it hurt, I deserve it
Well, it's love, it's love, it's love, make it hurt
The keys to the castle are right where I left them
The princess walked in just to take more attention
Cause after all, well, isn't that all that I've been after?
And after all, well, isn't that all that I'm after?
You're so

No way out, I'll give up in you, well, I'll give up in you
No way out, I'll give up in you
No way out, well, I'll give up in you, I'll give up in you
No way out, well, I'll give up in you

I wanted you for nothing more
Than hating you for what you were
If that's what you wanted to hear
If that's what you wanted to hear
I wanted you for nothing more
Than hating you for what you were
If that's what you wanted to hear
Don't leave me if that's what you wanted to hear
I wanted you for nothing more
Than hating you for what you were
If that's what you wanted to hear
Don't leave me if that's what you wanted to hear
I wanted you for nothing more
Than hating you for what you were
If that's what you wanted to hear
If that's what you wanted to hearEmbed
