A Decade Under the Influence Lyrics
Well, sad, small, sweet, so delicate
It used to be this dying breed
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this
I've got a bad feeling about this
You kept still until the long drive home
And slept safe and close to the window
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this
I've got a bad feeling about

Who's to say you'll have to go? (I could go all night)
Well, say you'll have to go (I could go all)
To hell with you and all your friends
To hell with you and all your friends, it's on

Well, sad, small, sure and porcelain
You're skin and bones, I'm a nervous wreck
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this (When it come to this)
I've got a bad feeling about this
You kept still until the long drive home
You slept safe and close to the window
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this
I've got a bad feeling about
Who's to say you'll have to go? (I could go all night)
Well, say you'll have to go (I could go all)
To hell with you and all your friends
To hell with you and all your friends, it's on
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this (What is this for?)
I've got a bad feeling about

Anyone will do tonight
Well, anyone will do tonight
Close your eyes, just settle, settle
Close your eyes, just settle, settle
Anyone will do tonight
Well, anyone will do tonight
Close your eyes, just settle, settle
Close your eyes, just settle, settle
Anyone (Anyone) will do tonight
Anyone (Anyone) will do tonight
Close your eyes, just settle, settle
Close your eyes, just settle, settle
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this
(To hell with you and all your friends)
I've got a bad feeling about this
I'm coming over but it never was enough
I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you
And I've got a bad feeling about this
(To hell with you and all your friends)
I've got a bad feeling about this
Coming over but it never was enough
I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you
I've got a bad feeling about this
(To hell with you and all your friends)
I've got a bad feeling about this
Coming over but it never was enough
I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this
(To hell with you and all your friends)
I've got a bad feeling about this
I'm coming over but it never was enough
I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this
I've got a bad feeling about this
I'm coming over but it never was enough
I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you
I've got a bad feeling about this
I've got a bad feeling about this
(I am you)
I've got a bad feeling about this
(I am you)
I've got a bad feeling about this
(I am you)
I've got a bad feeling about this
(I am you)
I've got a bad feeling about this
(I am)
I got it bad
I got it bad
I got it bad
I got it bad
I got it bad
I got it bad8Embed
