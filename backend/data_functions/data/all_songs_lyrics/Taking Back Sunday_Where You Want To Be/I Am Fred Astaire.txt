I Am Fred Astaire Lyrics
I'm under the assumption that
I'm gonna be the one that's leaving you
Tonight
Oh, tonight
Well, I flipped every switch
That I could find on my way out
Just to upset you more (just to keep you busy)
Just to make you angry (just because you were right)
Just because you were

All tired
Scream, safe haven
Let's get this out and on the table

Fast forward to, say, four o' clock
I'm keeping time
I'm holdin'
We're always holdin' (always holdin)
We're always holdin, holding out
And that's what got us here in the first place
You should have never come here alone
(You should have never bothered at all), bothered at all
Scream older and wiser
Still filled with resentment
We get it, we get it
(I haven't been happier since)
Older and wiser
Still filled with resentment
We get it, we get it
(I haven't been happier, no, I haven't been happy, no, not since)

Five o' clock the floor caught fire with footsteps (my footsteps)
And spread like a disease to the door
I'm stuttering through it but I hear it
Well, I-I I hear it's good t-t-to stick to what you know
And you know the whole lot of this
It all could have been avoided
When you were court side for this nightmare
Well since then I got myself
Come and listen

Older and wiser
Still filled with resentment
We get it, we get it
(I haven't been happier since)
Older and wiser
Still filled with resentment
We get it, we get it
(I haven't been happier, no, I haven't been happier, not since)
Well, we used to get so much more
(I used to, I used to too)
It used to take so much more
(I used to, I used to, I used to too)Embed
