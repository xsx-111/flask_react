Set Phasers to Stun Lyrics
Say yes, say yes, say yes, say yes
Say yes, say yes, say yes, say

I'm sorry it took me so long
I'm sorry it took me so long
To come around
I'm sorry it took me so long
To come around

Your famous last words started once your fingers hit the snooze
"Just nine more minutes please (And they)
They all know where to find me"
Every word that I said, what a big mistake
And the ones you left out are keeping me awake
Well, I will never make another promise without you
I won't ever make another promise with you in mind

So pace the stairs to your apartment
Like that’s where you wanna be (Where you wanna be)
That’s where you wanna be (Where you wanna be)

I'm sorry it took me so long
I'm sorry it took me so long
(To come around)
I'm sorry it took me so long
(To come around)
Well there's a secret I've been perfecting
I swore I wouldn't but you let me
I'm comfortably confused (And you)
You've gotten so removed
You know I, I could take the place of those pills
Ocean blue, paint it white
Now who you gonna call tonight?
Well, I will never make another promise (Without you)
I will never make another promise (With you in mind)

So pace the stairs to your apartment
Like that’s where you wanna be (Where you wanna be)
That’s where you wanna be (Where you wanna be)
So pace the stairs to your apartment
Like that’s where you wanna be (Where you wanna be)
That’s where you wanna be (Where you wanna be)
That's where you wanna be

Oh, we paint our sins on the ceiling
I keep them glued to my chest
It keeps me close like a promise kept
(Say yes, say yes, say yes, say yes)
If I talk in my sleep, will you just keep trying?
(We paint our sins on the ceiling)
I might give it up if you just keep trying
(Well I keep them glued to my chest)
If I talk in my sleep, if I talk in my sleep, it’s gone
(It keeps me close like a promise kept)
Say yes, say yes, say yes, say yes
I’m sorry it took me so long
Say yes, say yes, say yes, say yes
I’m sorry it took me so long
So pace the
(I don’t want to stop, I just want to know)
Stairs to your apartment
(I’m sorry it took me so long)
That’s where you want to be
(I don’t want to stop, I just want to know)
Where you wanna be
Where you wanna be
(Where you wanna be at)
(Where you wanna be at)
(Where you want to)Embed
