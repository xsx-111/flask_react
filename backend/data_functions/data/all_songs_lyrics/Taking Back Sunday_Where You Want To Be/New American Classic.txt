New American Classic Lyrics
"You've got to get better"
I said, "it's all in your head"
We could live through these letters
Or forget it all together
See, the months, they don't matter
It's the days I can't take
When the hours move to minutes
And I'm seconds away

Just ask the question, come untie the knot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
Retrace the steps, as if we forgot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
You try to avoid it, but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing I can do nothing about

Well, all that we need is just a reaction
It's too much to ask for when there's no attraction anymore
If chasing our dreams is just a distraction
I want to remember when I know that I can't go back
Just ask the question, come untie the knot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
Retrace the steps, as if we forgot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
You try to avoid it, but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing I can do nothing
There's one thing I can do nothing
There's one thing I can do nothing about

Just ask the question, come untie the knot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
Retrace the steps, as if we forgot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
You try to avoid it, but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing I can do nothing
There's one thing I can do nothing
There's one thing I can do nothing aboutEmbed
