Take Your Fingers from My Hair Lyrics
Take your fingers from my hair
They have gotten us nowhere
We can't last another second
For we are two, too lost for open doors
Take your memories and your ways
Let me see a brighter day
Greener fields aren't hard to hope for
It's just hard to go on living here without you

Somewhere I have dreamed
That you haven't got the time to be with me
Somewhere though it seems
That you have been making love without me

Starshine, moonshine
You're the light that shines upon me, baby
I know you'll go
Find yourself another lover, lady

Let me tell you how I feel
Loving others isn't real
You are blind, too blind to notice
That their love is not the love we share together


Starshine, moonshine
You're the light that shines upon me, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I know you'll go
Find yourself another lover, ladyEmbed
