Tenement Funster / Flick of the Wrist / Lily of the Valley Lyrics
My new purple shoes
Been amazing the people next door
And my rock-n-roll forty fives
Been enraging the folks on the lower floor
I got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best to be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokey's and rock
They line up like it's some kind of ritual
Oh, gimme a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light out of this place
I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
It's the same situation, just cuts like a knife
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy
(Young and you're crazy)
Ooh, gimme a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light out of this place

Dislocate your spine if you don't sign
He says I'll have you seeing double
Mesmerize you when he's tongue tied
Simply with those eyes, ooh
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise
(Don't look back, don't look back)
It's a rip off
(Flick of the wrist) and you're dead baby
(Blow him a kiss) and you're mad, ooh
(Flick of the wrist) he'll eat your heart out
(A dig in the ribs) and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
(All this time honey) Baby you've been had
Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not, you'll lie knee deep in trouble
Prostitute yourself, he says
Castrate your human pride ooh
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried
(Don't look back, don't look back)
It's a rip off
(Ahh)
(Ahh)
(Ahh)
Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross collateralize big time money money
Reduce you to a muzak fake machine
Then the last goodbye
(Flick of the wrist) and you're dead baby
(Blow him a kiss) and you're mad
(Flick of the wrist) he'll eat your heart out
(A dig in the ribs) and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm, taken a leg
(All this time honey) Baby, you've been had

I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no
Neptune of the seas, an answer for me please
This lily of the valley doesn't know
I lie and wait with open eyes
I carry on through stormy skies
I follow every course
My kingdom for a horse
But each time I grow old
Serpent of the Nile
Relieve me for a while
And cast me from your spell, let me go
Messenger from seven seas has flown
To tell the king of Rhye he's lost his throne
Wars will never cease
Is there time enough for peace?
This lily of the valley doesn't know2Embed
