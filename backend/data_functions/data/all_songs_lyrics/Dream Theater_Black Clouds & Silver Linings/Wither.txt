Wither Lyrics
Let it out, let it out
Feel the empty space
So insecure
Find the words and let it out

Staring down, staring down
Nothing comes to mind
Find the place
Turn the water into wine

But I feel I'm getting nowhere
And I'll never see the end

So I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I breakdown
And let the story guide me

Turn it on, turn it on
Let the feelings flow
Close your eyes
See the ones you used to know
Open up, open up
Don't struggle to relate
Lure it out
Help the memory escape

Still this barrenness consumes me
And I feel like giving up

So I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I breakdown
And let the story guide me
I wither
And give myself away

Like reflections on the page
The world's what you create

I drown in hesitation
My words come crashing down
And all my best creations
Burning to the ground
The thought of starting over
Leaves me paralyzed
Tear it out again
Another one that got away

I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear


I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I breakdown
And let the story guide me
I wither
And give myself away

Like reflections on the page
The world's what you create
The world's what you create
Let it out, let it out2Embed
