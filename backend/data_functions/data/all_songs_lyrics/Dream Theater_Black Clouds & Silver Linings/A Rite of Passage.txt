A Rite of Passage Lyrics
Since the new world order
Played upon our fears
Spreading accusations
Of radical ideas
The brotherhood of wisdom
Strength and dignity
Its rituals and secrets
Remain a mystery

Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The final stage, a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone
A rite of passage

Men of wealth and power
Influence and faith
Philosophers and leaders
Are members of the trade
Bound by open honor
Like the rose and cross
An enigmatic union
Of esoteric thought
Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The final stage, a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone
A rite of passage


Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The seven stars, the rising sun
A perfect world, a new life has begun
A rite of passage3Embed
