Stargazer LyricsHigh noon
Oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
Theres no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides
Why he's lighter than air
Oh, I see his face
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
So many die
We built a tower of stone
With flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
Don't know why
Now where do we go?
Hot wind moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins while we put his wing together
A tower of stone to take him straight through the sky
Oh, I see his face
Where is your star?
It is far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave, hey
I believe, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
Too many die
We built a tower of stone
With flesh and bone
To see him fly
But we don't know why
Oh, now where do we go?
All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still
Then there's blood on the sand
Oh, I see his face
Where was your star?
Was it far, was it far?
When did we leave?
We believe, we believe, we believe
In the heat and rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We built a tower of stone
Without flesh and bone
To see him fly
But why
In all the rain
With all our chains
Did so many die
Just to see him fly
Look at my flesh and bone
Now look, look, look, look
Look at this tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising
Look there on the horizon
And I'm coming home
Coming home, coming home
Time is standing still
He gave me back my will
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is weeping
But there's still hope, there's still hope
Oh, take me back
He gave me back my will
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Going home
I'm going homeEmbed
