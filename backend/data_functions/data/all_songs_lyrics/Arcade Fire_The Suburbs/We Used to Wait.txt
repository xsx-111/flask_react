We Used to Wait Lyrics
I used to write
I used to write letters, I used to sign my name
I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing lights settled deep in my brain
But by the time we met
By the time we met, the times had already changed
So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart, I never wrote it down
So when the lights cut out
I was lost, standing in the wilderness downtown

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

And it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive
We used to wait
We used to waste hours just walking around
We used to wait
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown
Ooh, we used to wait
Ooh, we used to wait
Ooh, we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooh, we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooh, we used to wait
Still moving through the pain

I'm gonna write
A letter to my true love, I'm gonna sign my name
Like a patient on a table
I wanna walk again, gonna move through the pain

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

Ooh, we used to wait
Ooh, we used to wait
Ooh, we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooh, we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooh, we used to wait
Still moving through the pain
We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now we're screaming
Sing the chorus again
We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now we're screaming
Sing the chorus again
I used to wait for it
I used to wait for it
Hear my voice screaming
Sing the chorus again
Wait for it!
Wait for it!!
Wait for it!!!11Embed
