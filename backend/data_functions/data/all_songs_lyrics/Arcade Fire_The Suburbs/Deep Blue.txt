Deep Blue Lyrics
Here
In my place and time
And here in my own skin
I can finally begin
Let the century pass me by
Standing under a night sky
Tomorrow means nothing

I was only a child then
Feeling barely alive when
I heard the song from the speaker of a passing car
Been praying to a dying star
The memory's fading
I can almost remember singing la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

We watched the end of the century
Compressed on a tiny screen
A dead star collapsing and we could see
Something was ending
Are you through pretending
We saw the signs in the suburbs?
You could never predict it
That it could see through you
Kasparov, Deep Blue, 1996
Your mind's playing tricks now
Show is over so take a bow
We're living in the shadows of the la la la la la la la
Oh, la la la la la la la

Hey
Put the cellphone down for a while
In the night there is something wild
Can you hear it breathing?
Hey
Put the laptop down for a while
In the night there is something wild
I feel it, it's leaving me

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la7Embed
