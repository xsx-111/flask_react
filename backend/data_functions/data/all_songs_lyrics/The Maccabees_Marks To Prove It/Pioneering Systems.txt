Pioneering Systems LyricsWhat would we have done
If you’d never come back?
The world, what was it coming to
The world, what was it coming to
What more could we have done
It carried on so long
The world, what was it coming to
The world, what was it coming to
When we dreamed in low resistance
Of pioneering systems
And listened to the words “we want to
Hear”
You had a vision
You were cutting your son’s hair
What a revelation
You never saw yourself there
What a revelationEmbed
