Slow Sun LyricsIt's Ok
Red Letter, Go-Getter
The Red Won't Come Off You
Faux Leather, Trendsetter
New Lace In An Old Shoe
Old Enough, Enough To Know Better
To Dress For The Weather
It's All You've Got
Waiting Up For You
Cup Of Tea For You
There On The Sofa
That's Real Love
Lone Figure, Sole Singer
The Floor Fills Around You
Breadwinner, Bone Digger
A Faith In The "All New"
Old Enough, Enough To Know Better
To Dress For The Weather
And It's All You've Got
She's Waiting Up For You
A Cup Of Tea For You
There On The Sofa
That's Real Love
And That's Real Enough
Holding Out For You
While The Company Owns You
You Know She Adores You
And That's Real Enough
No One Else Knows The Lenght
That She Goes to
To Keep It Together
And That's Real Enough
Now More Than Ever
Romance In Shit Weather
The Ordinary Glory Of A Real LoveEmbed
