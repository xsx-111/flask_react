Spit It Out LyricsSeen it spinning round
Out of all control
Twinkle, drink'll star
Spinning out, spinning out
There's one to wash it down
One to wash it out
One for the Postman’s Park
Spit him out, spit him out...

And he gets to the English coast
To the place he loved the most
Where the spinnakers on boats
Are filling out, filling out, out, out...
Filling out....  filling out.. filling out
And we get to guessing games
Where no one knows their names
Guess no one’s going home (hooome)
Staying out, out out..., staying out...
Staying out, staying out
What are we doing now, what are we doing now?
What are we doing now, what are we doing now?
What are we doing now, what are we doing now?
What are we doing now, what are we doing now?
What are we doing now, what are we doing now?
What are we doing now, what are we doing now?
What are we doing now?
Come on, come oooon it’s going to get easier from now
Oohh come on, come ooon it’s going to get easier somehow
Oh, What are we doing now, what are we doing now?
Oh what are we doing now, what are we doing now?
The storm came and tore limbs from the trees
Like a drowning whale
And the thought of it brought us all down to
Our knees...
Oh, what are we doing now, what are we doing now?
Oh what are we doing now, what are we doing now?
Spit it out... Spit it out...
Spit it out... Spit it out...
Spit it out...out out...Embed
