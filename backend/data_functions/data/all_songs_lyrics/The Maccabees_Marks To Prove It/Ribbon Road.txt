Ribbon Road LyricsOh fallen low
Endless round, endless roll
Endlessly signalling so
And it’s been real gold
Onward, headlong, night bus stoned
Oh tell us how telephone
Swollen thumb written on
Window of iron lung
In a hot wet glow
Onward, headlong, night bus stoned
Black curls, pale skin, paler in black
Underwear
Later on, later on, later on we won’t care
Onward, headlong, night bus stonedEmbed
