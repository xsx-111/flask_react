Marks to Prove It Lyrics
No one was crying
They simply got a little something in their eye
No one was lonely
They just could not get hold of anybody
Over the summer, life changed
And they all changed to keep up with it
Too complicated
Too complex to talk to anybody

Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Rolling shadows)
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Fallen arrows)

All this is sky-like
Forget that it’s there but it’s there, no doubt about it
Take a photo of it
Come back years on and wonder why you took it
Thousands of people
Tan lines and hopes the weather stays the weekend
Clouds and rain
And no one cares ‘til you’ve got the marks to prove it

Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Rolling shadows)
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Fallen arrows)
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Rolling shadows)
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Fallen arrows)
(Rolling shadows, fallen arrows)

Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Rolling shadows)
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Fallen arrows)
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Rolling shadows)
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Fallen arrows)2Embed
