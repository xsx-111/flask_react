River Song LyricsBack to the water
The Capital’s river
Hoping on hope that he’d see you again
Place he first met you
The twist of your figure
The turn of your head just the same
Nothing’s forgotten
It’s cold for the autumn
Decided to hide from the rain
You say you won’t forgive him
You throw your drink at him
But go back to his just the same
Your friends have all warned you
He’s no good for you
The truth is we’ve all done the same
You’re not getting any younger
Soldier on for another year
Tell yourself you’re getting wiser
The truth is we’ve all done the sameEmbed
