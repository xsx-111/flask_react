Dawn Chorus LyricsYou run rings around
You make perfect days
Swing a bottle and send him on his way
He still thinks about
How his ship has sailed
Swigs a bottle to send him on his way down
Break it up to make it better
Now the boat has flown
He still thinks about
How his ship has sailed
Swigs a bottle to send him on his way
And break it up to make it better
It’s not for us to say
It’s not for us to sayEmbed
