Silence LyricsThought I'd find it easier
Under lock, chain and key
Thought I'd find it easier
To just keep you to me
When the wisdom and the patience
Of the world's wasted on me
That's when I shut down my relationships
Watch them floating out to sea
I understand that it never ends
She's waiting 'round every corner, 'round every bend
And it hurts to know that I won't know if you knew how
The summer went
I understand silence
I understand that it never ends
She's waiting 'round every corner, 'round every bend
When you're scared and lost, don't let it all build up
Break the silence
Someone to call a best friend
Someone to be here when it ends
When you're scared and lost, don't let it all build up
Break the silence3Embed
