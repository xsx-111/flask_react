Guys Eyes Lyrics
I really want to do just what my body wants to
I really want to do just what my body needs to
If I could just hold all the thoughts in my head and just keep them for you
I really want to show to my girl that I want her
If I could just purge all the urges that I have and keep them for you
I really want to show to my girl that I need her
I keep it locked right now

Need her

I wanna do just what my body needs to
I wanna do just what my body needs to
I wanna show to my girl that I need her
I wanna show to my girl that I need her
So I used my mind
And I used my hand
It was what I want to do
I really don't know what to do if my body should want to
What I want4Embed
