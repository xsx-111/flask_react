Also Frightened Lyrics
Venture my way into the dark where we can sweat
One takes one by the hand
Let them crawl into the logs that dam
Brown jeans, the hue of their path
Excited and screamin' their voices grow wild
And rise with the birds mating up in the pines
Down to puddles that breathe, covered by leaves
With mud they'll make prints on their backs

Will it be just like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?
Will it be just like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?

If they're awake 'til the dawn
Well, we won't fret that they don't have our eye
The ghosts came crowding around
And then I woke, you slept there on your side
From our window, two lanterns draw signs on the night
And light our two shadows, I watch with delight
Will I want them to be who they will be
Or to be more like their dad?
Will it be just like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?
Will it be just like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?

When influence is threatened
Maybe I should let them
Maybe we should let them
And I have a question
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?

No one should call you a dreamer
No one should call you a dreamer
No one should call you a dreamer
No one should call you a dreamer8Embed
