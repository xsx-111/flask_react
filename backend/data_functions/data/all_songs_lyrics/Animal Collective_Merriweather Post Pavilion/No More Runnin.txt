No More Runnin Lyrics
No more runnin says my mind
All this movement has just
Proved your kisses are too fine
Hold the harmony
That I see
Friends I once had
Turn their thoughts away from me
No more runnin
I've got to breathe
On back porches
With the torch of a firefly-lit tree

It's what I hoped for
It's what I hoped for
No more runnin
No more runnin

I lock my bones and
Trip my feet
I told them
I'll find a place to be
Stick like candy
In your teeth
Will you lose your faith in me?
No more runnin
Says my mind
All this movement has just
Proved your kisses are too fine
