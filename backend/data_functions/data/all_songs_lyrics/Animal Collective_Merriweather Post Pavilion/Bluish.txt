Bluish Lyrics
I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm drawing pictures on your skin
So soft it twirls
I like your looks when you get mean
I know I shouldn't say so but when you claw me like a cat
I'm beaming
I like the way you squeeze my hand
Pulling me into another dream
A lucid dream
I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm getting crushed out on the things that only I should see

And not for boys, they're just for me
Hurry to talk from far away
I can see you, you curl your fists and you pull your hair
When we're alone I wanna say
Let's just stay in
No one's here in our apartment, babe

Put on the dress that I like
It makes me so crazy though I can't say why
Keep on your stockings for a while
Some kind of magic in the way you're lying there
I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm getting rushed back on a whim
Our breaths get wind
Back to the time when we were green
I know we have changed but I still grin
Cause I can't wait to see you
Back to the time I touched your hair
When I was so scared to look that mean, I think it's weird
I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm getting crushed out on the things that only I should see

They're not for boys, they're just for me
Girl, we could talk far away
It's so hard for me only to get the urge to kiss you there
When we're alone I wanna say
Let's just stay in
No one's here in our apartment, babe

Put on the dress that I like
It makes me so crazy though I can't say why
Keep on your stockings for a while
Some kind of magic in the way you're lying there
Put on the dress that I like
It makes me so crazy though I can't say why
Keep on your stockings for a while
Some kind of magic in the way you talk about your
Blue eyeshadow, it's not exactly blue, no
But you refuse to call it anything but your blue12Embed
