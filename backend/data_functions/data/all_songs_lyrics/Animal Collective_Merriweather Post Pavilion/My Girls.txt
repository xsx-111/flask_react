My Girls Lyrics
Isn't much that I feel I need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
But with a little girl, and by my spouse
I only want a proper house
There isn't much (Isn't much) that I feel I need (That I feel I need)
A solid soul (A solid soul) and the blood I bleed (and the blood I bleed)
But with a little girl (But with a little girl), and by my spouse (And by my spouse)
I only want (I only want) a proper house (A proper house)

There isn't much (There isn't much) that I feel I need (That I feel I need)
A solid soul (A solid soul) and the blood I bleed (and the blood I bleed)
But with a little girl (But with a little girl), and by my spouse (And by my spouse)
I only want (I only want) a proper house (A proper house)

There isn't much (There isn't much) that I feel I need (That I feel I need)
A solid soul (A solid soul) and the blood I bleed (and the blood I bleed)
But with a little girl (But with a little girl), and by my spouse (And by my spouse)
I only want (I only want) a proper house (A proper house)

I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the freshest wave
But to provide for mine who ask
I will, with heart, on my father's grave
I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the freshest wave
But to provide for mine who ask
I will, with heart, on my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats
For my girls
I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats
For my girls

There isn't much (There isn't much) that I feel I need (That I feel I need)
A solid soul (A solid soul) and the blood I bleed (and the blood I bleed)
But with a little girl (But with a little girl), and by my spouse (And by my spouse)
I only want (I only want) a proper house (A proper house)

I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the freshest wave
But to provide for mine who ask
I will, with heart, on my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
On my father's grave
I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats
For my girls
I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats
For my girls

I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats
For my girls
I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats
For my girls31Embed
