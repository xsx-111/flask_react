Chainsaw LyricsForlorn lists in true contempt
To destruct and dripping red
Is it time to come clean
Wash away everything
Hold the frame, still life focus
One's intent to not be noticed
Lost in lies, graceful charms
Losing touch with everyone
Management, terms and conditions
Waiting for own in addiction
A contract is raised
(The world's greatest mortuary)
Self destructive mechanism
Introvert overturn, assassination
Make from steel the ugly weapon
Killer's instinct from man to trigger
He carves with knife initials
Feel the pain of all initials
At one point decayed from suicide
Your night is my illusion
Peaceful time, direct potential
Living through one's own dementia
Come on, hold arms, dissect division
Caress duress, invite delusion
Back moving through the keyhole
Trust in keeping a value judgment
Overthrown like a somnambulist
Twisting and churning in retrospect
Management inedible
Benign applicants crime
Self destruct mechanism
Introvert overturn, assassination
Make from steel the ugly weapon
Killer's instinct from man to trigger
Destructive mechanism
Assassination
(To everlasting eternal peace)
Secure notes, management
Terms, conditions of such a phase
Undone, I can't see
Alive, alike
Want outEmbed
