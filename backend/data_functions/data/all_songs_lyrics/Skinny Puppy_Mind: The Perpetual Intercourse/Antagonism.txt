Antagonism LyricsWretched creatures stretch
Through the hoop again
No fault
Nothing ever gained
Leave it here how time does cover up
What was believed now turned inside out
Grasping hand through frantic air
Clawing upward inching near
A reason
Enough
To throw it back down in its place
Crying inward open space
A chasm that feeds itself
Rotting food left on the shelf
Alive yet unaware asking do you really care
Malefic regard with care
Witness hides and lies within
Melting features catch
Through the light remains
The doubt
Comes rushing back again
Pull the plug
Sank lifeless
Agitate
Power unleashed
Frequent fainting fits
Clasping a dark embrace
Let us not lose our place
Remember
Gazing crystal set
Through it be known
The truth
Burning bright insane
As a lamp grows cold
A fixture on the wall
Once regarded
Now bitter rotten flame
Decrepant quarrel
Old grey film
Covers eyelids reaching in
Enough
Fleeting image cracks
Moving past the brain
Relapse
Never to remain
Throw back in the face
Dripping plague
Hypocrisy
Raging to fuel itself
The parasite one calls itself
Listen as the hours pass
Burn the bridge again
Rebuild nothings quite the same
Split process
Clear cut
A single blade
Retracing the steps so easily mislaid
Knife in my hand
To stab at you and make demands
Discourse at times loses touch within my mind
Answer hides and lies withinEmbed
