Stairs and Flowers Lyrics...side of the house, touching each other. Those apple trees are really sickly, look, the fruit's all deformed. Even the flowers are ugly, and look at the foundation, it's enormous! It's too big for this house, like, some other kind of building stood here originally. That's strange, isn't it? Hmmm... It could support a castle
Seem solid
Floor could be rotted up there
Carol!
Colin...
Don't do that damn you!
I'm alright. What happened?
What do you mean what happened? I just slipped down these damn stairs!
Ow! (Breathing)Embed
