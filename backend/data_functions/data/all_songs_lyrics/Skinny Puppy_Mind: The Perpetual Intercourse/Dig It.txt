Dig It Lyrics(Dig it, dig it)
Love cannot attach itself to binding ugliness
Rise inside best to advise life the point at hand
Indifference as a race are we of each other's needs
Dress it up with false kindness
Create empathy
Hungry lie beside name your game
Feelings
Feeling sorry that I ever came
Sugar and water
Dissolve to taste
Sweet nothing
Illogical of own accord by choice of politics
Harmonize to verify the life experience
Practitioner of medicine
Prolong until the end
Bringing hope
Discuss the point
Extend eternity
(Dig it, dig it)
Execute economic slave
(Dig it, dig it)
Feel it
Unearthly remains
(Dig it, dig it)
Freedom as an offering
(Dig it, dig it)
Ask again
Flesh and bone attach itself to ancient monuments
Unsurpassed except for rust
Unheard violence
Departure from the fragrant ledge
A fall
Madness grin
Rip it up proclaims the right
Value ecstasy
Hungry lie beside name your game
Feelings
Feeling sorry that I ever came
Sugar and water
Dissolve to taste
Sweet nothing
(Dig it, dig it)
Execute economic slave
(Dig it, dig it)
Feel it
Unearthly remains
(Dig it, dig it)
Freedom as an offering
(Dig it, dig it)
Ask again
Do you hear that? The music! A band! Do you hear it? There's somebody here!
Boils bitten
Haggard pick
Vomit kicking out
Razor slide
Black eyed shroud
Brain-bespattered jaw
Retaliate so grudgingly
Precise as what it seems
Futile claim
Hypothesis
Enter carnal grin
Lie beside name your game
Feelings
Feeling sorry that I ever came

(Dig it, dig it)
Execute economic slave
(Dig it, dig it)
Feel it
Unearthly remains
(Dig it, dig it)
Freedom as an offering
(Dig it, dig it)
Ask again
(Dig it, dig it)
Ask again
(Dig it, dig it)
Ask againEmbed
