Deep Down Trauma Hounds (Remix) LyricsInjured plea crushed destiny
Deep down trauma hounds run to corrode integrity
Whatever matters and it would they fail to see
They make believe reality
Helpless deaths ignored to be judged as juvenile
Head caves in growing pains no time remains for fantasy
Tyranny exists we shrink beneath the ingrown thorns
Forced to accept pledge allegiance to a flag
Tested to forget you must resist they want you dead
What's the point of giving up leaving won't change anything
Political resentment
To push away all growth within
Puzzles me
Offers soul to nothing
The message screams its purity
That those with no rights display the right to have no life
To have respect they must accept a world committing suicide
Do you respect the world
Committing suicide?
Alright
Take your objects and lessen our
My lesson
Feels emptiness eternity keeps swallowing
Digested benefactors whose silence deafens anything
All of whom decease and miss to pierce a point
Take this hate of your life shame shame
Shame on me
Forget it
Forget
