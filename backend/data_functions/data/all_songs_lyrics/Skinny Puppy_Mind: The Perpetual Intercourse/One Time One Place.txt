One Time One Place LyricsMetal rain collapse
Crawls out
Which way the will go
Harness to ever last
Wallow in the past
A truth
At times so shallow
Develop an attitude
More time
Decay
Lapse in
Fortify thyself
Cut off
In bred and forever more
What a way to end the game
Failing
Bleeding eyes
Caricature of pain
Distant
So distant
Melting in the rain
Cold war
Flies forth on wings of self destruction
An orgy of missile tests
A mortifying flash
Huddled
Round the radio-active
Console to control
The lives of the young
Levels of toxic waste
Disgrace
Yet tolerant
Of all that's been done
Built up for a future race
A race that's never won
Falling from on high
Meet the makers face
Distort forget time
Forever leave this place
An atom fuse
Shortens with man's progression
Decipher what's relative
A legal bureaucrat
Motions with a tender finger
Who's poverty
And who will be next
A man in a cave
Further action left at that
Two gaping holes
A dripping carnivore
Nature's regret
The law of things so brutalized
An enemy that need not
Third world
Make peace
Visionary
Repress the weak
That's all there is
A hint of gleam
A halo of old jaded weakness
Corruption runs harmonious
Taken by extremes
Doorway
Extinction pleases
Repression is based on law
For a length of time
Full of elemental powers
In bred and not brilliant
No fortune could buy thisEmbed
