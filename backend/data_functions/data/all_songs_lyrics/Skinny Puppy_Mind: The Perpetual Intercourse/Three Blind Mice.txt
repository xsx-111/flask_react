Three Blind Mice LyricsVoices
Can you hear
It has begun
My double
The ugly
Symptom
Under the skin
Intent within
The shadow waves adieu
Joins the requiem
Spiteful
In character
No respect
The pupils dilate
Taking it all in
Diminutive
The right to live
No hope of anything
Obscene is so obscure
Do it again
Stoic
Ethics
All the same
Do it again
Mosaic paints of pretty days
Do it again
Do it again
Posture
Crumbling
It has begun
An empire
Lifetime
Decayed from within
Leaving is deadening
Ones own belief in
Ownership and credit of
Stipulate the whim
Visible
All can see
A constant pain
Reaping the harvest
Eating the grain
So sure and insecure of everything
Nervous tremour
I slip away
Bromide
Pocket vial
It has been done
My double
Now one
Forever gone
Answer within
A black ribbonEmbed
