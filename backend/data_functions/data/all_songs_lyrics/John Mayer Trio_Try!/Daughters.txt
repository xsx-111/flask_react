Daughters LyricsI know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
She's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me, yeah
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do, yeah
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Oh, no no no no, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now I'm left cleaning up the mess he made
I don't think so
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do, yeah
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You've found out how much they can take
As boys will be strong and boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without the warmth
From a woman's, from a woman's good, good
Good, good, good, good heart, good good heart
On behalf of every man
Who's looking out for every girl
You are the god, god and the weight
The weight of her world
On behalf of every man
Who's looking out for every girl
You are the god, you are the god
And the weight of her world
So fathers, be good to your daughters
And daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Hey, mothers be good to your, break it down
Hey, mothers be good to your
One more time around, oh
So mothers, be good to your daughters tooEmbed
