Try Lyrics
Takes four days to get to like me
But two to want to leave
But the part that really gets me
Are all the moments in between
Now, I lie to get a little
And laugh at every little thing
She's high on information
But, now, I'm low on self-esteem

So, I'm going to try (try)
I'm going to try (try)
Gonna try to be myself, although myself will wonder why
I'm going to try (try)
I'm going to try (try)
Gonna try to be myself, this time

I'm a hundred kinds of crazy
But I only want to find
One sweet little angel who's going to let me speak my mind
Now, all I ever do, these days, is dumb my process down
She's making her decision
But, now, I'm losing all my ground

Easy does it now, just keep your damn mouth shut
She thinks you're hot already, don't go and press your luck
No news is good news coming
You've got to wait to find
Don't go and blow it, you do every single time



Good night, everybody
Good night, everybody, gonna see you down the line
Good night, everybody
Good night, everybody
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try
Oh, you make me wanna try
Oh, you make me wanna try
Oh, you make me wanna, wanna try, try, tryEmbed
