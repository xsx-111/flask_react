Another Kind of Green Lyrics
Sarah's friend, she lost her mind
She left him and made it look sexy, now
I fear you won't be far behind
Thinking I'll be the next to leave, but

I know I might be anxious
But I'm still not crazy

And I don't need another kind of green to know
I'm on the right side, with you

I used to be the one you saw
When crying along to sad songs
But then we go and we hit the wall
When nothing has changed, and nothing's wrong

You're not the perfect hand
But I don't hit on nineteen

[And I don't need another kind of green to know
I'm on the right side
I'm on the right side, with you
With you]
So, go and drift away from me
Adopt some new philosophy
That doesn't hold the two of us in mind
Move into someone else's place
Stare into some other's eyes
But, slowly, only come to realize

[That you didn't need another kind of green to know
I'm on the right side
Sure I'm on the right side]
I'm on the right side, with you
Always on the right side
You don't need to lose, to know that you had it good
You don't need to lose it, to know that you had it good
No, no
You don't need to lose it, to know that you had it
Know that you had it, know that you had it
Don't need to lose it, to know that you had it good3Embed
