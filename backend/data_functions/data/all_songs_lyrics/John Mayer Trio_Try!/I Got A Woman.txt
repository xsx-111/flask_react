I Got A Woman Lyrics
She gives me money when I'm in need
Yeah she's a kind of friend indeed
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
Oh yeah
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
Oh yeah
She give me money when I'm in need
Yeah she's a kind of friend indeed
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
Oh yeah

She saves her loving early in the morning just for me
Oh yeah
She saves her loving early in the morning just for me
Oh yeah
She saves her loving just for me oh she loves me, loves me, loves me so tenderly
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
She's there to love me both day and night
Never grumbles or fusses always treats me right
Never running in the streets and leaving me all alone
Because a woman, she knows her place is right there now in her home
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
Oh yeah
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
Oh yeah
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
Oh yeah
She gives me money when I'm in need
Yeah she's a kind of friend indeed
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
Oh yeah
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
Oh yeah
She give me money when I'm in need
Yeah she's a kind of friend indeed
I got a woman way over town, she's good to me
Oh yeah
