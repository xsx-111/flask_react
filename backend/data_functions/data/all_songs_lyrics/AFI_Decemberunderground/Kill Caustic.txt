Kill Caustic Lyrics
So, I'm feeling much worse now
You're better, you're better
Your designer drug
Won't work, won't work for me
Connect to a three volt
I hope your battery dies
How could you run
On such, on such voltage?

All the same, I remain
The one to blame
And I'm demonized, purified
Justified, as you let yourself show

So now, you'll love these screams, what's left of me
(Don't speak)
Love these screams, like I do
(My name)

As the infinite stops cold
Just nine and the six are gone
Guess I was the one to
Ride that, ride that dirty ride
That is turning too fast now
I c-c-cannot, cannot hold on
But at this pace
Who would, who would want to?
All the same, I remain
The one to blame
And I'm demonized, purified
Justified, as you let yourself show

So now, you'll love these screams, what's left of me
(Don't speak)
Love these screams, like I do
(My name)
Don't ever speak my name

Don't ever speak my name again, don't ever speak it
Don't ever speak my name again, don't speak, don't speak
Don't speak my...
Don't speak my name

So now, you'll love these screams, what's left of me
(Don't speak)
Love these screams, like I do
(My name)1Embed
