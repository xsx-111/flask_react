The Interview Lyrics
Forever waiting for disaster
What David calls servant and master
Will you play it too?
As this displacement begs for water
Swimming, bathing
Drowning in sorrow
Scream with me

I crawl across this cracked expansion
I'll be buried soon
Beneath the sand with pure intentions
Wanting something, someone to follow

For a change, I'll refrain
From hiding all of me from you
(Here's my lullaby)
Pray for rain, lose your name
And watch all your dreams fall through
(Hush now, don't you cry)

I swoon upon my knees come crashing
Will you bury me?
Today, this small favor I'm asking
Hold me, you may drop me tomorrow
For a change, I'll refrain
From hiding all of me from you
(Here's my lullaby)
Pray for rain, lose your name
And watch all your dreams fall through
For a change, I'll refrain
From hiding all of me from you
Pray for rain, lose your name
And watch all your dreams fall through
(Here's my) lullaby
(Hush now), don't you cry

Calm down, come down
Cold resides with me
I'll flee to (I'll flee to) Decemberunderground
As you exhale, I breathe in (and sink into)
The water, underground
And I'll grow pale without youEmbed
