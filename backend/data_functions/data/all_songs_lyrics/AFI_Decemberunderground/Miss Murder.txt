Miss Murder Lyrics
Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

With just a look, they shook, and heavens bowed before him
Simply a look can break your heart
The stars that pierce the sky, he left them all behind
We’re left to wonder why he left us all behind

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

Dreams of his crash won’t pass, oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiraled down
The stars that mystify, he left them all behind
And how his children cried, "He left us all behind!"

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh...

What's the hook, the twist within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out
Without hope
We're the empty set just floating through empty skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?
Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh
Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Oh-oh!25Embed
