Endlessly, She Said Lyrics
Walked into our world and made
Horrible sounds
I can still hear them today
(Strangely, they seem)
Beautiful now
Though, they outlast my love

Still, each time, I always meant
Every word, every one
Though, in time, they finally bent
Every word, every one, every word

"I will wait for you," she said
Endlessly
"I will wait for you," so spoke
Misery

I returned to you but found
My empty home
The radio told me to stay
(As it burned down)
I sang alone
You will outlast my love
Still, each time, I always meant
Every word, every one
Though, in time, they finally bent
Every word, every one, every word

"I will wait for you," she said
Endlessly
"I will wait for you," so spoke
Misery

I have been waiting for you
Biding as you taught me to
I have come to relieve you
Of life and love

I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait
I will wait

"I will wait for you," she said
(I will wait)
Endlessly
"I will wait for you," so spoke
(I will wait)
Misery
I will wait for you
Wait for you
Endlessly
"I will wait for you," so spoke
So spoke
Misery
I will bite straight through
As I wait for you
Dear
EndlesslyEmbed
