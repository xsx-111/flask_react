Affliction Lyrics
Every night, devise new heights in genocide
Lover, I am loveless
All my friends and I toast health and suicide
Lover, I am lonely
Come on!

Were you holding hands when
My palms bled?

Oh, I will be all right, just use me
Just use me
The future's bright without me
Spend some time walking the line

World is unified, ennui, and I divide
Lover, I am loveless
Red days and burning might bleed 'til, 'til the faceless die
Lover, I am lonely

Were you holding hands when
My wrists bled?
Oh, I will be all right, just use me
Just use me
The future's bright without me
Spend some time walking the line
Spend some time walking the line

So stay sweetly numb
Remain lifeless, love
Stay sweetly numb
Maintain lifeless love
Stay sweetly numb
Remain lifeless, love

Oh, I will be all right, just use me
Just use me
The future's bright without me
Spend some time walking the line
Spend some time walking the line1Embed
