Summer Shudder Lyrics
Listen when I say
When I say it's real
Real life goes undefined
Why must you be so miserable?
Everything you take
Makes me more unreal
Real lines are undefined
How can this be so miserable?

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain
(Burn)
You turned away
(Under the summer rain)

Listen, I can't make
Make a sound, or feel
Feel fine, I kissed the lies
Why must they be so kissable?
Listen as I break
Break the four wall seal
Gorgeous eyes shine suicide
When will we be invisible?
Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain
(Burn)
We burned away
Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain
(Burn)
You turned away

This is the fall
This is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now
And our lives look so small
(Will they hear you crying)
This is the fall
This is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now
And our lives look so small

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain
(Burn)
We burned away
Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain
(Burn)
We burned away
Under the summer rain
(Burn)
I burned away
Under the summer rain
(Burn)
You turned awayEmbed
