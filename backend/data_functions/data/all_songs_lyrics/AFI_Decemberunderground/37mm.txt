37mm Lyrics
Bring your secrets to me
Just give me your hands and I'll let you feel the wounds
They put in me
If you believe in me, how can I be dissolving?
If you'd believe me, I'd tell you everything

Do you fall too? (every time that I)
Yes, I fall (every time that I)
Do you want to (try to pacify)
Fall into me? (fall into me, fall into me)
Into me

Silence, can you hear me?
Press me to your lips and I'll suck the poison out
Who will heal me, me?
If you keep killing me, how can I keep absolving?
Your sins into me, begin the poisoning

Do you fall too? (every time that I)
Yes, I fall (every time that I)
Do you want to (try to pacify)
Fall into me? (fall into me, fall into me)
Into me
Time, time, time
We're not waiting
Time, time, time
We're no one
I fall
I fall

Do you fall too? (every time that I)
Yes, I fall (every time that I)
Do you want to (try to pacify)
Fall into me? (fall into me, fall into me)
Do you fall too? (every time that I)
Yes, I fall (every time that I)
Do you want to (try to pacify)
Fall into me? (fall into me, fall into me)
Into me

We are no one
We are one
We are no oneEmbed
