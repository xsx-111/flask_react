Arise Dear Brother Lyrics
One, Two

We shall get together when the day is done
Rise to the moon, and set with the sun
You don't have to rush my pace, I always come
I think you're the one
But wait, there's some trouble with my mother
You know, I would rather be with you, lover
But sometimes she goes wrong
She needs a helping hand to stay strong
Even though you fucked him, I don't really give a shit
Maybe cause of my absence, you say it gives you the slip
To slip, you slipped and slide
Let this guy inside what I thought was mine
That night she lied, girl it reminds me of why
She's not my kind
Damn that slippery slime
Came back to hold me sometime
Another week I feel weak
Pretty sure I'm dying, as I speak
No prophets I seek
I told her all of this and she didn't feel sorry for me
When we meet, am I me
A blue moon midnight treat
And in the aftermath I can't sleep
You could complain, but I like to keep discrete
You could complain, but I like to keep discrete
(It was all stuck together)
You could complain, but I like to keep discrete
(It was all stuck together)
You could complain, but I like to keep discrete
(It was all stuck together)2Embed
