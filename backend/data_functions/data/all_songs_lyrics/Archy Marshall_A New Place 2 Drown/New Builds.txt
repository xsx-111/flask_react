New Builds Lyrics
The long courier makes haste to end
To give us night
He was concerned with the buildings
He was concerned with the gardens
Dealings of all of this, of all of this
I guess you did it to me, I guess you did it to me
You got me down
Whatever you do to me
What did you do to me
You got me down
What you do to me
I guess they did to me
You got me down 
You got me down (you got me down)
If you did to me, I guess they did to me
You got me down
I guess you did to me
Whatever you do to me
I guess they did to me
I guess you do to me
You got me downEmbed
