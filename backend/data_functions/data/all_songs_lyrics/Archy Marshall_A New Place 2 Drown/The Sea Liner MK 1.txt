The Sea Liner MK 1 LyricsFuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck up the church
Fuck up the church
Fuck up the church
Fuck up the church
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over (Fuck up the church)
Fuck yourself over (Fuck up the church)
Fuck up the church
Fuck up the church
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Yo I‘d be glad to drift some more
But I‘ve a plan to hit the shore
These distant lands they need a hand to be explored
She writes to me but does not come abroad
That‘s why I guess she can‘t be my broad
I love her so but she‘ll get bored
Across this planet I'll explore
She said my Spanish was so poor
I only know a few words I need to learn some more
A Peace signs plan to close the doors
Way up high the night ascends to dawn
Alone without a thought
Caught in this acidic downpour
It's about border combat it's a different type of war
They raise the bar to exasperate the poor
They raise the bar and close the doors
I must be ignored
I must be. Bah!
Fucks you round, beat up and drowns you like
 might fuck you round, beat up and drowns you like
MK1
Across this planet I'll explore
They raise the bar to exasperate the poor
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over
Fuck yourself over1Embed
