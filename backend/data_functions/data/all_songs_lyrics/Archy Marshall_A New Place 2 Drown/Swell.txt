Swell Lyrics
A new place to drown
(New place to drown)
A new place to drown

Well, I might have found
A new place to drown my sorrows and everything else
Well, fuck my mental health
It went down the drain as well
To be burnin' in hell, but you can't tell
You just swell, you just swell, you just swell

I start to lose control
Argh shit, now what have I done
I may have fucked away the only true one
The true girl under the sun
Piercing in and out of life
Oh how you live it free
This tiny eye, it cannot see things
Simple, lies and deceit
Yeah, they still live with me
Girl you budge for this simple enemy
Why'd you budge for this simple enemy , girl
A new place to drown
(New place to drown)
A new place to drown

See well, I might have found
A new place to drown my sorrows and everything else
Well, fuck my mental health
Went down the drain as well
To be burnin' in hell, but you can't tell, girl
You just swell2Embed
