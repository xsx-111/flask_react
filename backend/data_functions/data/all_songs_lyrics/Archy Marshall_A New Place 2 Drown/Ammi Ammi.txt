Ammi Ammi Lyrics
I'm fine
That's blood upon my lips I close my eyes
And I see you smile upon the...
"Boys and girls, the Lord is the one who gives us new life and He's doing that"

Lonely, I slowly slip into a pool of gold
She takes my hand and doesn't let it go
I feel it deep within my soul
Her whisper resonates my bones
I'm slowly hit and I slowly drift away
This liquid silk consumes me
Well she's the type I carry by my side
Keeps me balanced, keeps her talons in my thigh
Reminds me of the damage of how I live my life
Keeps my salary damaged, hanging from the line
Her love's unlimited, she lays there playing Barry White
Girl, she plays me Barry White
All night as we drift into the light

We just smoke and let days roll by (just roll by)
We don't care whether day or all night (all night)
We just smoke and let things roll by (just roll by)
We don't care whether day or all night (the days roll by)
We just smoke and let days roll by (days roll by)
We don't care whether day or all night
We just smoke and let days roll by (days roll by, days roll by)
We don't care at all, girl
Hey
We just smoke and let things roll by
We don't care where whether day or all night
We just smoke and let things roll by
We don't care4Embed
