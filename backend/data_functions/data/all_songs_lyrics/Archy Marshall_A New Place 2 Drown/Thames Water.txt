Thames Water LyricsI don't make money off it anymore
He said, reaching for the pile of scores
I offer no remorse
Man sat at the bar waging his wars
Onto the cats enjoying their main course
And I guess these speakers help ignore
Bartender knows all my floors
She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows
My blood is good
She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows
When it rains it fucking pours
Sky opens its mouth and spits to the floor
Soakin' all of us scum to the core
She spent every day escaping thought
Cubicle girl scrambles on all fours
She lost her powers in the powder she adored
Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit
Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like
Girl, this place is evil
Its lost its love with its people
Its got me losin' touch
Girl, this place is evil
Its lost its love with its people
Its got me losin' touch
When I found you things was right
These cunts will say anything just to get you with 'em
Who I am to mistakes that you can take to
Take your time to be playing the fool
But I'm not really with you
Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit
Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit
Girl this place is evil
Its lost its love with its people
Girl, its got me losin' touch
I think I'm losin' touch
I think I'm losin' her
There's something in the water contorted her mind
Distorted in the border with war in her eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit, girl
Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted in the water with war in her (his) eyes
This inner city life treats me so shit
(Man, this is intimate for you to do on this journey)
Through this goddamn wind
She had everything
I've been top of the globe
Blowing green round rings
We're watching pirate video
The sun fucks the screen
Take me over down the loco
Sipping crisps in the light with a zippo
And ooh is that the gold loco
Call my boy up just for a chill
He says he's no show
I guess it's just me and you
I guess I see my only note
I used to be rainy days
Look outside the window
I might see yellow skies
And I see papa in the close
I didn't even know where I was
Didn't even know what to do
Fruit Loops goddamn winds
At the top of the glow
I'm blowing green round rings
We're watching pirate video
The sun fucks the screen
Take me over to the loco
Said we could use a light we'll find something
Green eyes, icicles
I'm craving just one blem
And only have enough for one smoke
Getting tired of so much shit
I guess no one really knows
Cause I'm about the reefer
And the 
She looks so fine
She blows my mind I feel so high
I let her know
She just so fine
She blows my mind3Embed
