Dull Boys Lyrics
She don't see me
She don't see me
She doesn't see me
She don't see me for what I am

I've lost all my dignity
She don't even mean that much to me
I don’t even know 'bout this
Family tree we’ve been spreading
Across the south east, girl I-
Her heart doesn’t owe anything to your dignity
Please

We must've lost that moment when we felt connected
She reaches for the phone
Well now she planned her exit
See, somewhere along the line
She must've felt disconnected
Seeing those shallow eyes of mine
Might've been too well expected
What can you expect kid?
But her (my) body I don't know
I haven't felt much in a long time
I just might as well see how it goes
Spent a while I've been on my own, girl (girl)
I've lost all my dignity
She don't even mean that much to me
I don’t even know 'bout this
Family tree we’ve been spreading
Across the south east, girl I-
Her heart doesn’t owe anything to your dignity
Please

She won't forget me ever
She won't forget me ever
She won't forget me ever
She won't forget me foreverEmbed
