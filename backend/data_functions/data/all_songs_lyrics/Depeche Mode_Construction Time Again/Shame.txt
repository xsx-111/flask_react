Shame Lyrics
Do you ever get that feeling when the guilt begins to hurt?
Seeing all the children wallowing in dirt
Crying out with hunger, crying out in pain
At least the dirt will wash off when it starts to rain

Soap won't wash away your shame

Do you ever get the feeling that something isn't right?
Seeing your brother's fists clenched ready for the fight
Soon the fighting turns to weapons and the weapons turn to wounds
So the doctors stitch and stitch and stitch and stitch and stitch and stitch and stitch

Surgery won't improve your pain

It all seems so stupid
It makes me want to give up
But why should I give up
When it all seems so stupid?

Do you ever get the feeling that something can be done
To eradicate these problems and make the people one?
Do you ever get that feeling, something like a nagging itch?
And all the while the doctors stitch and stitch and stitch and stitch and stitch
Hope alone won't remove the stains (Shame)

It all seems so stupid
It makes me want to give up
But why should I give up
When it all seems so stupid?1Embed
