And Then... Lyrics
Let's take a map of the world
Tear it into pieces
All of the boys and the girls
Will see how easy it is

To pull it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith or, I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse

All that we need at the start's
Universal Revolution (That's all)
And if we trust in our hearts
We'll find the solutions

To pull it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith or, I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse

Took a plane across the world
Got in a car
When I reached my destination
I hadn't gone far
Let's take the whole of the world
The mountains and the sand
Let all the boys and the girls
Shape it in their hands

To pull it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith or, I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse
Put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then (That's all)
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse
Put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse (That's all)
Put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then (That's all)
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse (That's all)
Put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then (That's all)
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn...1Embed
