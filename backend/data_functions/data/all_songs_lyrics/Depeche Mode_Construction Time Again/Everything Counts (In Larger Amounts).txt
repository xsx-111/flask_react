Everything Counts (In Larger Amounts) Lyrics
Grab all they can
After all
Grab all they can
After all

The handshake seals the contract
(The handshake, the handshake)
From the contract, there's no turning back
(The handshake, the handshake)
The turning point of a career
(The handshake, the handshake)
In Korea being insincere
(The handshake, the handshake seals the contract)
The holiday was fun-packed
(The handshake, the handshake)
The contract still intact
(The handshake, the handshake)

The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves, after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves, after all
It's a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts

The graph on the wall
(The graph, the graph)
Tells the story of it all
(The graph, the graph)
Picture it now, see just how
(The graph, the graph)
The lies and deceit gained a little more power
(The graph, the graph on the wall)
Confidence taken in
(The graph, the graph)
By a suntan and a grin
(The graph, the graph)


The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves, after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves, after all
It's a competitive world
(Everything, everything, everything, everything)
(Everything, everything, everything, everything)
Everything counts in large amounts
Everything counts in large amounts

The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts

(Everything, everything)
(Everything, everything)

The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts

Everything counts in large amounts

The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
Everything counts in large amounts

The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amountsEmbed
