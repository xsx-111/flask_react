More Than a Party Lyrics
Lots of surprises in store
This isn't a party, it's a whole lot more

We've had enough of this blind man's buff
You've kept us in the dark for long enough

This is more than a party
More than a party
More than a party

Keep telling us we're to have fun
Then take all the ice cream so we've got none

This is more than a party
More than a party
More than a party


The failed magician waves his wand
And in an instant, the laughter's gone
This is more than a party
More than a party
More than a party


Lots of surprises in store
This isn't a party, it's a whole lot more
More than a party
(More, more, more)
More than a party
(More, more, more)
(More, more, more)
(More, more, more)
More than a party
(More, more, more)
(More, more, more)
(More, more, more)
(More, more, more)Embed
