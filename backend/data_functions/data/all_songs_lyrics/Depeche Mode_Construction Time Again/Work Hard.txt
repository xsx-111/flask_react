Work Hard Lyrics
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
If you want anything at all
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
If you want anything at all

Nothing comes easy
But that's a fact
Nothing comes easy
But a broken back


You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
(You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard)
(If you want anything at all)
(You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard)
(If you want anything at all)

Nothing comes easy
It never will
Nothing comes easy
But a broken will

You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
(You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard)
(If you want anything at all)
(You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard)
(If you want anything at all)

(You've got to work hard)
(You've got to work hard)
(You've got to work hard)
So work hard!
(You've got to work hard)
(You've got to work hard)
(You've got to work hard)
So work hard!
(You've got to work hard)
(You've got to work hard)
(You've got to work hard)
So work hard!4Embed
