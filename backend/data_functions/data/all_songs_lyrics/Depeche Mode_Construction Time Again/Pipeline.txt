Pipeline Lyrics
Get out the crane, construction time again
What is it this time?
We're laying a pipeline
Let the beads of sweat flow till the ends have met though
Could take a long time
Working on the pipeline

Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy


On this golden day, work's been sent our way
That could last a lifetime
Working on the pipeline
From the heart of our land to the mouth of the man
Must reach him sometime
We're laying a pipeline

Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy

Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy
Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy
Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy
Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy
Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy3Embed
