Get the Balance Right! Lyrics
There's more besides joyrides
The little house in the countryside
Understand, learn to demand
Compromise, and sometimes lie

Get the balance right
Get the balance right

Be responsible, respectable
Stable but gullible
Concerned and caring, help the helpless
But always remain ultimately selfish

Get the balance right
Get the balance right

When you think you've got a hold of it all
You haven't got a hold at all
When you reach the top, get ready to drop
Prepare yourself for the fall
You're gonna fall
It's almost predictable (Almost)
Don't turn this way, don't turn that way
Straight down the middle until next Thursday
First to the left, then back to the right
Twist and turn 'til you've got it right

Get the balance right
Get the balance right
Get the balance right
Get the balance right
(Almost)
Get the balance right
Get the balance right
(Almost)
Get the balance right
Get the balance...1Embed
