Jesus On The Mainline Lyrics
I know Jesus is on that mainline
Tell Him what you want
Jesus is on that mainline
Tell Him what you want
Jesus is on that mainline
Tell Him what you want
Call Him up and tell Him what you want

Well, the line ain't never busy
Tell Him what you want
Whoa, that line ain't never busy
Tell Him what you want
Well, the line ain't never busy
Tell Him what you want
You can call Him up
And tell Him what you want

Well, if you want in His kingdom
Tell Him what you want
If you want in His kingdom
Tell Him what you want
If want in His kingdom
Tell Him what you want
Call Him up, call Him up, call Him up, call Him up
You can call Him up and tell Him what you want
Well, if you're sick and want to get well
Tell Him what you want
Well, if you're sick and you want to get well
Tell Him what you want
If you're sick and you want to get well
Tell Him what you want
Call Him up and tell Him what you want

And if you're feeling down and out
Tell Him what you want
If you're feeling down and out
Tell Him what you want
If you're feeling down and out
Tell Him what you want
Call Him up and tell Him what you want

I know Jesus is on that mainline
Tell Him what you want
Jesus is on that mainline
Tell Him what you want
Jesus is on that mainline
Tell Him what you want
Call Him up, call Him up, call Him up
Call Him up, call Him up, call Him up
You can call Him up and tell Him what you wantEmbed
