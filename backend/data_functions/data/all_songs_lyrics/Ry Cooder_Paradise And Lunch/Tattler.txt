Tattler Lyrics
Whenever you find a man
That loves every woman he sees
There's always some kind of woman
That's a-puttin' him up a tree
Now that kind of man
He ain't got as much sense as a mule
You know, everyone don't love you
They're just a-playin' you for a fool

Mmmm, oh, no
It's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can

If you marry the wrong kind of woman
And you get where you can't agree
Well, you just as well could get your hat
And let that woman be
But a man oughta make a good husband
And quit tryin' to lead a fast life
Goin' about dressin' up other women
Won't put clothes on his own wife
Mmmm, oh, no
It's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can

Well, there's lots of good women who wants to marry
And they wants to live well at home
But they're 'fraid they'll might get hold of a rowdy man
That can't let other women alone
And there's lots of good men now wants to marry
And they wants to live well at home
But every time they turn their back
There's a man there askin', "Darlin', is he gone?"

Mmmm, oh, no
It's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you canEmbed
