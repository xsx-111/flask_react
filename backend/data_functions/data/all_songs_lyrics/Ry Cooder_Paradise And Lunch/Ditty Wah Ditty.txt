Ditty Wah Ditty Lyrics
There's a great big mystery
And it sure is worrying me
It's ditty wah ditty, Mister Ditty Wah Ditty
I wish somebody would tell me what ditty wah ditty means

I went out and walked around
Somebody yelled, "Now who's in town?"
Mister Ditty Wah Ditty, Mister Ditty Wah Ditty
I wish somebody would tell me what ditty wah ditty means


Some little girl 'bout four-feet-four
Said, "Come on, papa, and gimme some mo'"
Your ditty wah ditty, your ditty wah ditty
I wished somebody would tell me what ditty wah ditty means

Now I went to church, put my hat on the seat
A lady sat on it and said, "Now Daddy you sho' is sweet"
Mister Ditty Wah Ditty, Mister Ditty Wah Ditty
I wish somebody would tell me what ditty wah ditty means

I said, "Sister, I'll soon be gone
Just give me that thing that you're sitting on"
My ditty wah ditty, Mister Ditty Wah Ditty
I wish somebody would tell me what ditty wah ditty means

Then I got put outta church
'Cause I talk about ditty wah ditty too much
Mister Ditty Wah Ditty, Mister Ditty Wah Ditty
I wish somebody would tell me what ditty wah ditty means
