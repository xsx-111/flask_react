Mexican Divorce Lyrics
It's a sin for you to get a Mexican divorce

Down below El Paso lies Juarez
Mexico is different, like the travel folder says
Cross the Rio Grande and you will find
An old adobe house
Where you leave your past behind

One day married, next day free
Broken hearts for you and me
It takes no time, for you to get
A Mexican divorce

I came into this lonely house last night
I looked at all the windows but I couldn't find one light
I found you on that road to Mexico
And now, my love, I beg
Please, oh, please, don't go

One day married, next day free
Broken hearts for you and me
It's a sin for you to get a Mexican divorce

Finding love takes so long
Walking out, well must be wrong
It's a sin for us to get a Mexican divorce
One day married, the next day free
Broken hearts for you and me
It's a sin for you to get a Mexican divorceEmbed
