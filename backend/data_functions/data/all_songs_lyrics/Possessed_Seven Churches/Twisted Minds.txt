Twisted Minds Lyrics
Twisting my mind
Insane ripping out your brain
You're slain
Grieving the sunset
Terror and your last breath is nearer
Revenge!

Draining your soul out
Bloodies awaiting the final sentence
Grasping your last piece
Of mind slip into madness
Our kind
Revenge!

Life is strange
It's one big name
Live or dead
Is all the same
Hidden secrets inside my head
Decaying bodies my blade is red
Rotting world so full of clones
Sickening feeling inside my bones
Madness creeps up from behind
Sanity is drained my state of mind
Mentally insane
Maladjusted minds
Lunacy within
Evil twisted minds

Cast my wishes from the grave
Below the earth my body enslaved
Cults of people down in hell
Skulls are splitting from their spell
Forgotten souls arise at night
Rule the world with unchallenged might
The sun sets into the sea of blood
Chanting Satan as they drone
Mentally insane
Maladjusted minds
Lunacy within
Evil twisted minds

Twisting my mind
Insane ripping out your brain
You're slain
Grieving the sunset
Terror and your last breath is nearer
Revenge!
Draining your soul out
Bloodies awaiting the final sentence
Grasping your last piece
Of mind slip into madness
Our kind
Revenge!Embed
