Holy Hell Lyrics
Holy hell
Death to us
Satan fell
Unholy lust
Devil's water
Starts to flood
God is slaughtered
Drink his blood
Our bonding
Trust is at hand
Go we must
To Satan's land
Pray for death
And cry for life
Reaper's breath
Will breathe new life

Satan's child
He is born
And to death
He is sworn
Days of hate
And days of pain
Endless term
Of Satan's reign
Endless dreams
In the night
Eternal sleep
Eternal fright
Defiled crosses
Oh black mass
Satan's reigns
Me at last

All of heaven
All of earth
You'll meet your god
Chained to torment
Chained to pain like a dog
Evil days
And evil nights are black as death
Hearts of sinners
Hearts of stone reaper's breath
There was blood
And there was pain ecstasy
Rage of magic
Rage of witches sorcery
Feel the power
Feel the heat down below
Kill the people
Kill the dead, take their soul
Blackened masses
Blackened crosses ritual
Cut the heads
Cut the throats take the fallEmbed
