The Exorcist Lyrics
Possessed by evil force Satan's wrath will kill
He will take your soul cast you to hell
Demons dog domain keeping me insane
Evil curse my soul burning away

Satan's hell will burn terrored cries are heard
Ever lasting eternity warriors of hell
Unleashed men of sin hatred hell within
Sinners hate will die the exorcist

I can see the light I don't want to burn
Help me save my soul let me live
Your curse is not my fear demons within me hear
I will escape your wrath 666
This is not my way doom, sorrow for eternity
Lights shine below in hell forever burning
Words of insanity scream out the final plea
Evil voices scream out help me

Demons in my body gone sicken thoughts left beyond
Haunted by evil memories nightmares and sin
My mind is burnt and black shadowed no way back
Fear of living in hell axed my mind
Memories held within Satan's gone in sin
Grasping to relieve the pain scared for life
Exorcism takes control beneath my body help my soul
Save my soul from evil hell your spell is lostEmbed
