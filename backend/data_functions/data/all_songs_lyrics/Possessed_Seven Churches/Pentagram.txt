Pentagram Lyrics
There's a sacred city not far from here
Where the earth is bare and the sky is black
Tormented souls are stricken with fear
And the sinners all know that there's no way back

Flying to the pentagram
There's a lot you'll want to see
Sacrifice the crying Ram
And drink the blood with me

Giant kingdom down below
Where the lord of darkness sits and waits
For a poor lost mortal to come in
When he lowers down his gates

Prison of death where time stands still
Forever life of pain
Walking dead assault and kill
The people would be slain

There's a sacred city not far from here
Where the earth is bare and the sky is black
Tormented souls are stricken with fear
And the sinners all know that there's no way back
Giant kingdom down below
Where the lord of darkness sits and waits
For a poor lost mortal to come in
When he lowers down his gates

You can't escape your destiny
So take my hand and fly
To an evil land of fantasy
Inside of Satan's eyeEmbed
