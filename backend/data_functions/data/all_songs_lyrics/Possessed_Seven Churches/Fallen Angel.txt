Fallen Angel Lyrics
Deceiving angel full of hate
Outcasts will rebel
Below the crust, the dark kingdom
Also known as Hell
Fallen angel distrusts god
Exiled down below
His burning lust to power all
Starts his own domain

Poisoned minds, evil plague
Wicked shrines, where you beg
Merciless angel fell
Soul won't rest, into hell

Flames of fury burning hot
Glowing in his eyes
Down below forever rot
Until his soul can rise
Hell-sent souls become his slaves
Working against all
Bringing pain the masters raves
Lucifer they call
Poisoned minds, evil plague
Wicked shrines, where you beg
Merciless angel fell
Soul won't rest, into hellEmbed
