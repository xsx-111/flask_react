Seven Churches Lyrics
Seven churches down in Hell
In the land where Satan fell
Vows of Satan's sacred scripts
Bring out the evil from its crypts
Seven churches, seven priests
Seven hearts on which they feast

Watch the gods take revenge
Rot in hell for your sins
Sacrifice, to the sky
Terror strikes, you will die

Taste the blood of the dead
As the sky turns to red
Rot in heaven, rot in hell
Reach for the land from which he fell
Seven bibles, seven crosses
Seven saints mourn for their losses

Watch the gods take revenge
Rot in hell for your sins
Sacrifice, to the sky
Terror strikes, you will die
Holy water turned to blood
Destroy the earth, devils flood
Pounding death from my hands
Spreading Satan through the lands
Seven prayers, seven bells
Seven churches rise from Hell

Watch the gods take revenge
Rot in hell for your sins
Sacrifice, to the sky
Terror strikes, you will dieEmbed
