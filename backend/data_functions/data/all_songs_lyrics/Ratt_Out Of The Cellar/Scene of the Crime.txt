Scene of the Crime LyricsI wanna rock, but you, you dared to roll
I came by your house, but you, you weren't at home
Well, I knock on your door, I hear you beg for more
You broke the law you see, and that's a felony
(Chorus)
I think you've been caught (You have been caught)
At the scene of the crime (You have been caught)
At the scene of the...
Now I know what you've done to me
At the scene of the crime
Cold blooded bitch goin' out on me
I've got me a weapon, got me a loaded gun
You know I'll track you down
And you'll be on the run, no fun
(Chorus)
You broke the law in the first degree
Cold blooded bitch goin' out on me
(Chorus)
Now I know what you thought of me
Cold blooded bitch goin' out on me
Well, I know, well, you know, well, I know
Well, I know, well, your games
And I don't wanna play
Solo
(Chorus)
You broke the law in the first degree
Cold blooded bitch goin' out on me
(Chorus)
Well, now I know what you thought of me
Cold blooded bitch goin' out on me
Solo
You've been out, and I've been cheated
Well, I've been lied to, again and again, again and again
(Chorus)
Now I know what you've done to me
At the scene of the crime
Cold blooded bitch goin' out on me
At the scene of the...
(You have been caught) At the scene of the crime, yeah
(You have been caught) At the scene of the...
You broke the law in the first degree
At the scene of the crime
Cold blooded bitch goin' out on me
At the scene of the crimeEmbed
