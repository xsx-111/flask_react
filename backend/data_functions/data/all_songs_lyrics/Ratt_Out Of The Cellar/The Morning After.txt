The Morning After LyricsYou think unkindly
Simple not sane
Know what I mean
Say I'm deliberately sent here to please
It's what you need
So I'm here tonight
You won't confuse me with somebody else
Look in your mirror
You're too good for yourself
It's all in your books
Your magazines
Can't you see?
I'll be heading out in time
If it's wrong or right
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
Say I'm inviting to somebody else
Know what I mean
I know you'll always think one of my kind
You're on my mind, baby
All the time
Lift your skirt, lady
High in the night
I'm just what you need
Won't you give it a try?
Don't put up a fight
It's gonna be alright
Can't you see?
I'll be heading out in time
If it's wrong or right
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
Say bye-bye
It's gonna be right
Right out of the night
When out of the night
Now it's gonna be right
It's gonna be right
Right out of the night
When out of the night
Can't you see?
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning, morning, morning
Morning, morning
On and on
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning afterEmbed
