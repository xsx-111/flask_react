Lack of Communication LyricsToo many problems
The world can't solve
Too many people
No one wants to be involved
(Lack of communication, back off)
Keep rearranging
It's all the same
Always saying someone else is to blame
(Lack of communication, back off)
Look all around me
Who's standing tall
Hold tight
No one's gonna answer your call
(Lack of communication, back off)
Put up our boundaries
We build our walls
It's all right
No one's gonna change us at all
(Lack of communication, back off)
Time's passing us by
We have our reason
No one wants to try
We have our reason
Questions asking why
We have our reason
Problems still arise
We have our reason for
Back off
You're so together
You fall apart
You never miss
When you're shooting straight for the heart
(Lack of communication, back off)
You see it your way
I'll see it mine
Well, conversation is a useless change of line
(Lack of communication, back off)
Time's passing us by
We have our reason
No one wants to try
We have our reason
Questions asking why
We have our reason
Problems still arise
We have our reason for
(Lack of communication, back off)
Lack of communication
(Lack of communication, back off)
Well, back off
Well, back off
(Lack of communication, back off)
In the age of the modern man
(Lack of communication, back off)
We see the problems
But we don't really understand
(Lack of communication, back off)
Well, lack of communication
(Lack of communication, back off)
Well, lack of communication
(Lack of communication, back off)
Well, lack of communication
(Lack of communication, back off)
Lack of communication
(Lack of communication, back off)
Back off, well, back off
(Lack of communication, back off)
Back off
Back off
(Lack of communication, back off)Embed
