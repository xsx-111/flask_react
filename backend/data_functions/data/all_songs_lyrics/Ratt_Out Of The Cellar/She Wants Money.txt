She Wants Money LyricsI take her home
It's late at night
She's looking good
Hot tonight
And I wanna know how far she goes
She gives the clue
I make my move
I got the rhythm in the groove
Slow at times
Right tonight
(She wants money)
She
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
She's so ready
Doesn't even care
She's like a razor cutting through the air
She's calling me
I'm so at ease
I understand what she's tellin' me
It's so clear that even I can see
You wanna play
You've gotta pay
(She wants money)
She
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
I try to tell her I don't have no cash
She looks at me and starts to laugh
I don't wanna know
You've gotta go
I see her walkin' on down the street
She sees another
And she acts so sweet
You wanna try your luck tonight
(She wants money)
She
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
She wants money
Yeah
(Just money)
She walks the streets all night alone
She acts so sweet
She makes it known
She wants money
(She wants money)
She
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
Quick change
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
Oh, she
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
She wants money
(She wants money)
She makes me feel so goodEmbed
