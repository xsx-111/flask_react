In Your Direction LyricsWell, I saw the time closin' in, you said you're leavin' me
I'm cursed with your heart's perfection
Well, said it's right to believe
Well, months and days, they slowly pass
I'm not waitin' for you
You turned me 'round in your direction
I'm lookin' for you, yeah

You spin me your way, in your direction
You pull me your way, in your direction
Well, city lights are shinin' on me
Well, said it's time to go
Abusin' you all across the country
Said I feel hot coals, yeah

Solo
