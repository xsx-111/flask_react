Love Like This (Acoustic) LyricsRunning through the heat heart beat
You shine like silver in the sunlight
You light up my cold heart
It feels right, in the sun
We're running round like love is what we found
Like nothing else could matter in our life
But wait, but wait, but wait
The sun will stop shining soon
And you'll be dark from my life
It's as simple as a change of heart
A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I, I don't mind, I don't mind at all
Slipping into the night love
It grows dark but you don't mind
Hiding in the back streets, yeah, you'll never notice me
All that I was thinking is cleaning up my conscience
I got lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?
Or maybe it was just as simple as a change in your heart
Just as simple as a change of a heart
A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
A love like this
A love like this
A love like this
A love like this
A love like this won't last forever1Embed
