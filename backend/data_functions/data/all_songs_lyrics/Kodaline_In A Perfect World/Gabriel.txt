Gabriel LyricsHe was an archangel of love
He had good news
For those dedicating their lives
To the spirit
One love was the focus of
The true message
Everybody felt the tension
Time was fading
Gabriel playin', Gabriel 
Gabriel
Dancin soon became the way
To, to communicate
Those who stood aside and watched
Gabriel playin'
Gabriel playin', Gabriel 
Gabriel 
Gabriel playin'
Gabriel
Gabriel playin'
Archangel of love
The message
Gabriel
He had good news
Gabriel
Gabriel playin', Gabriel Embed
