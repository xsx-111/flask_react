Lose Your Mind Lyrics
Loosen up and lose your mind
You never know what you could find on the other side
A hundred thousand butterflies
Floating in the orange skies above my head
I wander lonely as a cloud
Floating high above the ground with aeroplanes
I hear the sound of hummingbirds
The sweetest sound I've ever heard, I can't describe

Oh oh, I'm dreaming up a world with you
Oh oh, and all the things that we could do

Feeling like a plastic bag
Spinning 'round but slowly going nowhere fast
Waterfalls inside my eyes
Am I on the other side, am I dreaming?
Holding on to a dolphin's fin
He helps me swim where I can't swim, he's friendly
Loosen up and lose your mind
You never know what you could find on the other side

Oh oh, I'm dreaming up a world with you
Oh oh, and all the things that we could do

Walking on a tightrope wire
Dropping poison, pills of fireâ€¦ hynoptised
Euphoria will be here soon
Turn the lights down, let the answers fill the room

Oh oh, I'm dreaming up a world with you
Oh oh, and all the things that we could do
A hundred thousand butterflies
Floating in the orange skies above my head
Loosen up and lose your mind
You never know what you could find on the other side
And all the things that we could do

All of the things that made you feel better
You should take it all, write it all down and make you feel better
All of the things that made you feel better
You should write it all down and put it in a letter3Embed
