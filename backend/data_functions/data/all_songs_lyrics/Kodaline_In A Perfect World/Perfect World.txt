Perfect World LyricsTouch gloves, yeah, it'll be alright
I always knew you had a heavy heart
Brother, brother
You're taking me back to the start
I saw your face in a photograph
Painting a picture of a better time
Brother, brother
You'll always be on my mind
Yeah

In a perfect world
In a perfect world
In a perfect, a perfect world
Touchdown to reality
It's not exactly what you had in mind, oh
Brother, brother
Was it only a matter of time
Yeah, oh
Maybe you've gotta let it be
Maybe time will tell, maybe you will see, oh
Brother, brother
You really shouldn't take it too hard
Oh


Ooooooooh
In a perfect world
In a perfect world
In a perfect, a perfect world
Ooooooooooooh
In a perfect world
In a perfect world
In a perfect world, singing
Ooooooooh
It'll be okay (In a perfect world)
It wouldn't have to be this way (In a perfect world)
In a perfect, a perfect worldEmbed
