One Day LyricsOne day it's here and then it's gone
How are you still holdin' on
How are you still holdin' on
You felt this way for far too long
Waitin' for a change to come
You know you're not the only one
And life
Passes you by
Don't be wastin' your time
On your own
You're always tryin' to see yourself
Through the eyes of someone else
Through the eyes of someone else
Too shy to say that you need help
You and everybody else
You and everybody else
Oh, life
Passes you by
Don't waste your time
On your own
Yeah, life
Passes you by
Don't be wasting your time
On your own
As your heart gets bigger
And you try to figure out
What's it all about
When your skin gets thicker
As you try to figure out
What's it all about
Yeah life
Passes you by
Don't waste your time
On your own
One day it's here and then it's gone
How are you still holdin' on
How are you still holdin' on12Embed
