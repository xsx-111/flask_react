Talk Lyrics
I can remember the good old days
Where you and me we used to hide away
Where the stars were shining or the sun was blinding our eyes
Yeah you filled up my glass
With promises that could never last
But I still find pieces of you in the back of my mind
And all of the things that we once said
They're not in my heart they're in my head
That was the time to say goodbye
Let's put it to rest, yeah, let it dieâ€¦

'Cuz we don't, we don't need to talk about this now
Yeah we've been down that road before
That was then and this is now
The crowds in my heart they've been calling out your name
Now it just don't feel the same
Guess it's over, yeah, we're done

I heard you made your way downtown
To the place I'd been hanging around
I was looking for your face in the crowd but trying to keep my head down
Over time our wires crossed
When you changed and the truth got lost
All the things I would change if we could only rewind
You were a moment in life that comes and goes
A riddle, a rhyme that no one knows
A change of the heart, a twist of faith
Couldn't fix it, it's too late


Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhh x6
We don't we don't need to talk about this now x414Embed
