High Hopes Lyrics
Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feelin' it again
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
But it's not that easy

I remember it now, it takes me back to when it all first started
But I only got myself to blame for it and I accept it now
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
But It's not that easy

But I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes
When you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes
When it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around

And in my dreams I meet the ghosts of all the people who've come and gone
Memories, they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon
Naive, I was just staring at the barrel of a gun
I do believe it
Yeah, but I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes
When you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes
Oh, when it all comes to an end
The world keeps spinning
Yeah, the world keeps spinning
Around


Ohh, high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes
When you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes
Ohhh-ohhh
Yeah, but the world keeps spinning, uhh
Yeah, this world keeps spinning

How this world keeps spinning around?53Embed
