Latch (Live) Lyrics
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there, there are boundaries
I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on babe
Now I know what I have found

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love, your love

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
You got me shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

I feel so encaptured
Got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored
Hold me tight within your clutch
How did you do it?
You got me losing all my breath
How did you give me
To have my heartbeat out my chest?
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
You got me shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
You got me shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

Whoa...

I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
You got me shackled in my embrace
I'm latching onto you3Embed
