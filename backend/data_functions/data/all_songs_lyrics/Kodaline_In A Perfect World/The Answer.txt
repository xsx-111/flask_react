The Answer LyricsWatch your step or you might fall
You act like you're a know-it-all
Yeah I used to do that, I used to be like that
I'm still a bit like that
You might think you found the one
Until your heart gets ripped and torn
Yeah I used to feel bad, I used to feel like that
I still feel a bit like that

But I'm not searching for the answer
I'm not looking for the truth
I'm just talking through a speaker
Because that's all that I have ever learned to do
Use your mind and make it talk
Cause in this world it's all you've got
We all fall down from the highest clouds to the lowest ground
The loneliness is worst of all
When you've got no one else to call
Feeling kind of sad when the times are bad, the times are getting bad
But I'm not searching for the answer
No, I'm not looking for the truth
I'm just talking through a speaker
Because that's all that I could ever learn to do
Because that's all that I have ever learned to do
What about you?...
So watch your step or you might fall
You act like you're a know-it-all
Yeah I used to do that, I used to be like that
I'm still a bit like thatEmbed
