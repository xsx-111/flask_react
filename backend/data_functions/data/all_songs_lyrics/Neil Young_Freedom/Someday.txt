Someday LyricsRommel wore a ring on his finger
He only took it off
When he flew his plane
Once he told me why
He said we all have to fly
Someday
We all have to fly
Someday
The T.V. preacher can't be bothered
("Praise The Lord! Praise and Pay!")
With those petty things
("Praise The Lord! Praise and Pay!")
He stays a step removed so they say
("Praise The Lord! Praise and Pay!")
("Praise The Lord! Praise and Pay!")
He's piping music in
We all have to sin
Someday
We all have to sin
Someday
Working on that great Alaska pipeline
Many men were lost in the pipe
They went to fueling cars
Now smog might turn to stars
Someday
Smog might turn to stars
Someday
Hold me baby, put your arms around me
Give me all the love you have to give
Tomorrow won't be late
We won't have to wait
Someday
We won't have to wait
