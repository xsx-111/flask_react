No More Lyrics
Living on the edge of night
You know the sun won't go down slow
You don't know which drug is right
Can't decide which way you want to go
I feel the way you feel
Because not so long ago
It had a hold on me
I couldn't let it go
It wouldn't set me free
It wouldn't set me free
No more, no more, no more

Seemed like the easy thing
To let it go for one more day
Like singing the same old song
And twisting the words
In a different way
Where did the magic go
I searched high and low
I can't find it no more
I can't get it back
I can't find it no more
I can't find it no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Searching for quality
Having to have the very best
Now scrounging for quantity
Never having time
To do the test
That's how the story goes
Can't put it down
Till the last page
I can't put it down
I can't put it down
I can't put it down
