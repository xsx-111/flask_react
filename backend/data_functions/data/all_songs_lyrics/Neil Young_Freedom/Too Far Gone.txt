Too Far Gone Lyrics
When I woke up you were gone
And the sun was on the lawn
Empty pillow with perfume on
I smelled it
Well we met in my favorite bar
Took a ride in my old car
But I still don't know how
We made it home

Was I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you

We had drugs and we had booze
But we still had somethin' to lose
And by dawn I wanted to marry you
With our attitudes by day
And our secret dreams by night
Can we really live our lives that way?

Am I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you
Was I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for youEmbed
