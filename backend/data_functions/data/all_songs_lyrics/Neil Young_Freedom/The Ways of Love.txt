The Ways of Love Lyrics
You are my special one
Made my heart come all undone
We've been having too much fun
Now someone else
Will sleep with tears
When he hears
What we've done

Oh, the ways of love
Oh, the ways of love

Hear my song
And hear my heart
We'll be gone
When the music starts
Then we'll never be apart
Just you and I
Go flying by
No one to cry
That we're gone
