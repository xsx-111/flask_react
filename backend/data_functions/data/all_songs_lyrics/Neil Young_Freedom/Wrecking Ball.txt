Wrecking Ball Lyrics
My life's an open book
You read it on the radio
We got nowhere to hide
We got nowhere to go
But if you still decide
That you want to take a ride
 
Meet me at the wrecking ball
Wrecking ball
Wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight

I see your smoky eyes
Right across the bar
I've seen that look before
Shining from star to star
Though I can't take that chance
If you got time for one dance
 

The restless line of cars
Goes stretching down the road
But I won't telephone
Because you might say hello
What is it makes me feel this way?
What is it makes me want to say
