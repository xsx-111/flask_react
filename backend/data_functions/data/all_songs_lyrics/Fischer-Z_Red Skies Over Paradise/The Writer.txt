The Writer LyricsThe other side of the room an empty bottle lies broken
Purple faces are sure, of snow white sheets to soak in
His clothes are spread around, they smell of perspiration
A half eaten meal attracts the flies attention
Do I Do I Do I Do I Hear the man's cries
Do I Do I Do I Do I See in his eyes
Do I Do I Do I Do I Care if he dies
Do I Do I Do I Do Do I
Take a paper towel and place it over his head
Phone up reception and report him as dead
Open up the window and expose him to light
Push it all away from me...
No that can't be right
Ri High hight
Ri High hight
Ri High hight
A continental breeze has set the blinds in motion
Brings just a hint of change from the Atlantic Ocean
The ancient church bell rings. Defies the march of progress
The senoritas said you were too young to notice
Do I Do I Do I Do I Hear the man's cries
Do I Do I Do I Do I See in his eyes
Do I Do I Do I Do I Care if he dies
Do I Do I Do I Do Do I
Take a paper towel and place it over his head
Phone up reception and report him as dead
Open up the window and expose him to light
Push it all away from me...
No that can't be right
Ri High hight
Ri High hight
Ri High hight...Embed
