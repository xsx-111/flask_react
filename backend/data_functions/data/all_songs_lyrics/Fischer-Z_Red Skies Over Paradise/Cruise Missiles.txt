Cruise Missiles LyricsWe share a common destination
Each person has their time to die
But men are speeding up their journey
By seeing what they can destroy with their
Cruise missiles - We're living near those
Cruise missiles - We're looking for those
Cruise missiles - They're not five years away
They're building shelters for the privileged
There won't be room for you and me
So read your pamphlets of precautions
They'll make you laugh until you see that those
Cruise missiles - We're living near those
Cruise missiles - We're sitting on these
Cruise missiles - They're not five years away
Cruise missiles - I'm living near those
Cruise missiles - I'm sitting on these
Cruise missiles - They're not five years away
They claim the ultimate solution
To all the problems that we face
It's pointing rockets at the Russians
And hope they don't end up in Greece
All those
Cruise missiles - We're looking for those
Cruise missiles - We're standing near those
Cruise missiles - They're not 5 miles away
They're not 5 years away
They're not 5 miles away
They're not 5 miles awayEmbed
