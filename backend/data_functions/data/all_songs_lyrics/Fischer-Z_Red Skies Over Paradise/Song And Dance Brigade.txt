Song And Dance Brigade LyricsRub your eyes and look again
Facial features show the strain
But don't back-a-don't back away
Idle hours lose their charm
But they won't do you any harm
If you don't back-a-don't back away
They won't appreciate your long experience
Working dance halls on your own
They can't mechanize the song and dance brigade
They'll only notice when we've gone
It's over today - don't back away
It's over today - don't back away
It's over today - don't back away
It's over today - don't back away
But don't back-a- don't back-a- don't back-a- don't back away
See that twinkle in your eye
Precious moments never die
So don't back-a-don't back away
In the time that you've been on
A generation's come and gone
But don't back-a-don't back away
They won't appreciate your long experience
Working dance halls on your own
They can't mechanize the song and dance brigade
They'll only notice when we've gone
It's over today - don't back away
It's over today - don't back away
It's over today - don't back away
It's over today - don't back away
But don't back-a- don't back-a- don't back-a- don't back awayEmbed
