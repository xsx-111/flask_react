Battalions Of Strangers LyricsThe map has gone
It's burning in the afternoon
The smell's so strong
No chance to waft away
Gold medallions for the proud men in kahki
Those Battalions of strangers
Those Battalions of strangers
No one wants to lead the way
Be the first death of the day
Leave this family behind
It must all be in the minds of
Battalions of strangers
Of Battalions of strangers...
Of Battalions of strangers
Battalions of strangers...
The sound of guns
Has given way to children's cries
The war has come home
The black smoke and the hordes of flies
Gold medallions for the citizens who stand and wait
Those Battalions of strangers
Those Battalions of strangers...
No one wants to lead the way
Be the first death of the day
Leave this family behind
It must all be in the minds of
Battalions of strangers
Of Battalions of strangers
Of Battalions of strangers
Of Battalions of strangers
The voice of calm
From Moscow to the Pentagon
Sound the alarm
And try to back the better one
Gold medallions for men who must negotiate
For those battalions of strangers
For those battalions of strangers ...Embed
