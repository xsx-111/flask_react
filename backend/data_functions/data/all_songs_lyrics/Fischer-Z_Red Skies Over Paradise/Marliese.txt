Marliese LyricsI told them I take photos for this magazine
They let me in to see you comb your hair
I watched for signs as I came through that door
The anxious eyes that I've been waiting for
It's no use hoping I'm a dream
Oh Marliese
The waiting almost brought me to my knees
Oh Marliese
You didn't really think I'd leave you in peace
It's no use crying out 'cos they can't help you now
You're forced to hear the words I have to say
I saw your face when I was taken down
You seemed so pleased, you're not so happy now
It's your turn to be afraid
Oh Marliese
The waiting almost brought me to my knees
Oh Marliese
You didn't really think that I'd leave you in peace
Oh Marliese
The waiting almost dragged me to my knees
So where's the smooth composure of the movie star
You must have played this many times before
Do I see tears? Well surely that's not true
Don't kid yourself, it's not worth hurting you
But remember when you try to sleep
Oh Marliese
The waiting nearly brought me to my knees
Oh Marliese
You didn't really thought that I'd leave you in peace
Oh Marliese
The waiting almost brought me to my knees
Oh Marliese
You never really thought that I would leave you in peaceEmbed
