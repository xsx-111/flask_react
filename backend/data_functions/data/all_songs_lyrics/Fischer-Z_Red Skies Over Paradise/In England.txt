In England LyricsColourful compartments
Desert island views
Elusive in England
Forget the fabrications
Give us all a clue
Have faith in horizon
Intercity interlude
Jack and Jill rub thighs and think it's rude
Keeping close along the line
Lovers losing sense of time
In England...(In England...)
In England...(In England...)
In England...(In England...)
In England...(In England...)
In England...(In England...)
In England...(In England...)
Ooooooo that's nice
Ooooooo paradise
Many manifestos
Nailed up on the wall
Out of the blue...
Only for you
Printed regulations
Quick to disapprove
Restrictions restrictions
Skin and bones can't find a way
To keep the British blues at bay
Underneath the surface laughter
Voices quiver in the dark
In England...(In England...)
In England...(In England...)
In England...(In England...)
In England...(In England...)
In England...(In England...)
In England...(In England...)
Ooooooo that's nice
Ooooooo Paradise
Ooooooo that's nice
Ooooooo Paradise
(In England...In England...In England...In England...)Embed
