Red Skies Over Paradise LyricsMy hand reached down for the radio
I held it up to my ear
The beads of sweat gathered on my head and trickeld down
Out in the park children were playing
Though it was dark... the sky glowed red
People were stunned, everyone waiting
Nobody knew why...
But they know it all now
The newsman said most of London's gone
We saw the cloud rise from here
An ice cream van with it's music on goes round and round
Out in the park children were playing
Though it was dark the sky glowed red
People were stunned, everyone waiting
Nobody knew why...
But they know it all now
Down in their bunkers under the sea
Men pressing buttons don't care about me
Down in their bunkers under the sea
Men pressing buttons don't care about me
There's lots of sand on the cellar floor
We went down there for the night
The barricades that my brother made keeps out the light
Out in the park... children were playing
Though it was dark the sky glowed red
People were stunned, everyone waiting
Nobody knew why...
But they know it all now
Down in their bunkers under the sea
Men pressing buttons don't care about me
Down in their bunkers under the sea
Men pressing buttons don't care about me
Down in their bunkers under the sea
Men pressing buttons don't care about me
Down in their bunkers under the sea
Men pressing buttons don't care about meEmbed
