Multinationals Bite LyricsYou're no anarchist
You're not extreme
But you threaten them
With your dream
So be careful
Multinationals bite bite bite
They'll destroy you
Overnight
I hear wardrums (Picking up pieces of blood for you, now)
I hear wardrums (Picking up pieces of blood for you, now)
I hear wardrums (Picking up pieces of blood for you, now)
I hear wardrums (Picking up pieces of blood for you, now)
You don't realise
The extent of their power
I can't help you
Anymore
And you'll find out
Multinationals bite bite bite
They'll destroy you
Overnight
I hear wardrums (Picking up pieces of blood for you, now)
I hear wardrums (Picking up pieces of blood for you, now)
I hear wardrums (Picking up pieces of blood for you, now)
I hear wardrums (Picking up pieces of blood for you, now)
There's no justice
Outside the law
They have governments
Under control...Embed
