Bathroom Scenario LyricsEverywhere I go
I find birthpills in the bathroom
Part of the scenery
Have you had one today?
No longer shocking
The inside of handbags
Used to be hidden
Now out on display
Professional women
Who work for a living
Run through their washing
When they come home at night
Jars of cosmetics
Open and oozing
Petroleum jelly
Like turkish delight
Modern World how I hate it
Modern World you can take it
Modern World your magic's gone for me
Where's the mystery that there used to be
No more escaping
You're caught in the crossfire
See yourself naked
As you stand on the scales
No more illusions
Under strip lighting
So heartless and truthful
It tells you no lies
Modern World...you can take it
Modern World...how I hate it
Modern World...your magic's gone for me
Where's the mystery that there used to beEmbed
