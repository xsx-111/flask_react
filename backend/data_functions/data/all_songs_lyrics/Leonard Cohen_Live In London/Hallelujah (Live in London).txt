Hallelujah (Live in London) Lyrics
I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Now, maybe there's a God above
As for me, all I ever heard from love
Is how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
But it's not a crime that you hear tonight
It's not some pilgrim who claims to have seen the light, no
It's a cold, and it's a very broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Oh people, I have been here before
I know this room, and I've walked this floor
You see, I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But this isn't love, love is not some kind of victory march, no
It's a cold, and it's a very lonely Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now, now you never even show it to me, do you?
I remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove, she was movin' too
And every single breath we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I've done my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I learned to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come here to London just to fool you
And even though hurt, it all went wrong
I'll stand right here, before the Lord of Song
With nothin', nothin' on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, HallelujahEmbed
