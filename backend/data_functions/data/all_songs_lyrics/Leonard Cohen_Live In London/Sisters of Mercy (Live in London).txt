Sisters of Mercy (Live in London) LyricsOh the sisters of mercy
They are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me
When I thought that I just can't go on
And they brought me their comfort
And later they brought me this song
Oh I hope you run into them
You who've been traveling so long
Yes you who must leave everything
That you cannot control
It begins with your family
But soon it comes round to your soul
Well, I've been where you're hanging
I think I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy
Your loneliness says that you've sinned
They lay down beside me
I made my confession to them
They touched both my eyes
And I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf
That the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love
That is graceful and green as a stem
When I left they were sleeping
I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights
You can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous
If I hear that they sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that
And besides it would still be all right
We weren't lovers like that
And besides it would still be all rightEmbed
