Closing Time (Live in London) LyricsSo we're drinking and we're dancing
And the band is really happening
And the Johnny Walker wisdom running high
And my very sweet companion
She's the Angel of Compassion
And she's rubbing half the world against her thigh
Every drinker every dancer
Lifts a happy face to thank her
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime
All the women tear their blouses off
The men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found and partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:
It's CLOSING TIME
Yeah the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:
It's CLOSING TIME
We're lonely, we're romantic
And the cider's laced with acid
And the Holy Spirit's crying, "Where's the beef?"
And the moon is swimming naked
And the summer night is fragrant
With a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder
To the tower where the blessed hours chime
And I swear it happened just like this:
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The Gates of Love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But CLOSING TIME
I loved you for your beauty
But that doesn't make a fool of me:
You were in it for your beauty too
I loved you for your body
There's a voice that sounds like God to me
Declaring that your body's really you
I loved you when our love was blessed
And I love you now there's nothing left
But sorrow and a sense of overtime
And I missed you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's CLOSING TIME
We're drinking and we're dancing
But there's nothing really happening
The place is dead as Heaven on a Saturday night
And my very close companion
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing
She's a hundred but she's wearing
Something tight
I lift my glass to the Awful Truth
Which you can't reveal to the Ears of Youth
Except to say it isn't worth a dime
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the Devil and it's once for Christ
But the Boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights
Of CLOSING TIMEEmbed
