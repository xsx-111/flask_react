Introduction (Live in London) LyricsThank you so much friends
I was, I was having a drink with my old teacher
He is 102 now
And this was, he was just, about 97 at the time
And I poured him a drink and
He clicked my glass and said:
"Excuse me for not dying"
I kinda feel the same way
I want to thank you not just for this evening
But for the many years that you've tkept my songs alive
I appreciate it
I don't want anyone to get alarmed
I know that you probably never seen
One of these before, but it goes by itselfEmbed
