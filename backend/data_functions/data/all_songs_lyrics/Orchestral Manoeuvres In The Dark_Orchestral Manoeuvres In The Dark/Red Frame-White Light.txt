Red Frame/White Light LyricsRed frame white light
Telephone box
Red on grey
Six three two three double 'O' three
Red frame white light
You have a gray book
On a metal shelf
Red frame white light
Numbered calls
Selected places
Red frame white light
Telephone calls
Black and white
Red frame white light
You have a yellow book
With adverts
Red frame white light
There is a black lead to a dial and phone
Red frame white light
Six three two three double 'O' threeEmbed
