Everything You Say Will Destroy You LyricsWell they sent back all the bodies
Who were looking really hopeless
Well it didn't seem that callous
Till they stopped you in your flow
She's surrounded by her wardens
And they're looking really nervous
All about the man from reuters
Here to nullify your glow
Everything
You say
Will destroy you
Anyway
Everything you say
Will come haunt you
Round each corner
Everything you say will destroy you
Well you may think that you're Buddha
Lying on a mound of ashes
You were mentioned in the postscript
Of dispatches anyway
And the major's really nervous
When he's walking round the airport
You know your master's card is marked
Your upstart charge is cool and smart
Everything
You say
Will destroy you
Anyway
Everything you say
Will come haunt you
Round each corner
Everything you say will destroy you
Well your unwanted suitor
Leaves his things around your home
He's marking out his territory
He's pissing on your answerphone
Well you may think that you're Buddha
Lying on a mound of ashes
You were mentioned in the postscript
Of dispatches anyway
Everything
You say
Will destroy you
Anyway
Everything you say
Will come haunt you
Round each corner
Everything you say will destroy youEmbed
