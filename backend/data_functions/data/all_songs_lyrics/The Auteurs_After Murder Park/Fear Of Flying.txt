Fear Of Flying LyricsWe must be wary of fallen stars
They're always poking around in the dark
The aerial view of a dying man
Slowly become an invisible man
You may be wary of ghosts of your dark
They know all your history, they know all your past
All of the angels are doing their bit
Clearing the house of your animal shit
Fear of flying
Is eating you whole
I have no fear of dying at all
And it's absurd
A silver bird
Could have a fear of flying at all
You must be wary of who you short-change
Keeping the short-con well within range
The aerial view of an idiot bird
Screaming out "Could you help me?", but nobody heard
Fear of flying
Is eating you whole
I have no fear of dying at all
So it's absurd
Silver bird
Could have a fear of dying at all
You may be wary of ghosts of your past
Sexless and incorrigible in the dark
Making an aerial map of abuse
All of the A-roads are leading to home
Fear of flying
Is eating you whole
I have no fear of dying at all
And it's absurd
A silver bird
Could have a fear of flying at all
Have a fear of flying at all
Could have a fear of flying at allEmbed
