Buddha LyricsHappy birthday Buddha
Happy hunting, happy hiding
Happy New Year
I hope you get yourself together
I hope your absence is made clear
Happy birthday Buddha
I first learned
There was a value
In a little subterfuge
From some old
Peeping tom or another
Woman's refuge
Came in contact with a Svengali
He was housebound and unwell
Choked on a whale bone in a Cantonese restaurant
His nervous system
Had broken down
Buddha Buddha Buddha hoo
Buddha Buddha Buddha hoo
Buddha Buddha Buddha hoo
Happy birthday Buddha
Happy birthday Buddha
Happy hunting, happy hiding
Happy New Year
I hope you get yourself together
I hope your absence is made clear
Happy birthday Buddha
Happy birthdayEmbed
