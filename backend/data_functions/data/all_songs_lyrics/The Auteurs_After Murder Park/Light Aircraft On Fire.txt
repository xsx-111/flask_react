Light Aircraft On Fire LyricsWhen you cut your lover's slack
You'll get a monster back
Formations indiscreet
It's just an acrobatic feat
Dissipates into mercury
Disintegrates at 2000 feet
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on
Tombstone Victoria
Was an ex wing-walker
Everybody ignored her
Everybody implored her to
Vanish in to the radio
Disappear in the waveband slow
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on fire
Disintegrate at 2000 feet
Disappear into mercury
There's a dark premonition an accident will happen
There's a pre-science preacher in the cabin
Everybody eat your dust
Everybody love your dust
Oh
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft on
Light aircraft on fire
Light aircraft onEmbed
