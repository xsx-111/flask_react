Married To A Lazy Lover LyricsSack the maid
Put her in chains
Until she says that it's painless
And I couldn't care less
Twenty years
Married to a lazy lover
Twenty years
Mixing alcohol and downers
Sack the maid
For dealing in state propaganda
Sack the state
Marry-yeah
What would your common lover do
Beat the daylights out of you?
It's a national threat
Married to a lazy lover
Against the west
Married to a lazy lover
Sack the maid
For dealing with state propaganda
Sack the state
Marry-yeah
I could teach him how to drink
But he just threw up in the sink
The man from the ministry
Said right away
That your lover's on the shelf
Would he bite the bit
Or split my lip?
Anyway this marriage is annulled
Window shopping for the kill
A Jewish princess on a hill
Twenty years
Married to a lazy lover
Twenty years
Married to a lazy lover
Sack the maid
Sack the maid
Sack the maidEmbed
