Unsolved Child Murder LyricsPeople 'round here
Don't like to talk about it
Presumed dead
Unsolved child murder
Since they dragged the lake
You know they sealed all fate
Cordoned off some woodland
Gave a photo to a psychic
Presumed dead
Unsolved child murder
If I die before my parents die
If I die before my parents die
More hate mail through the door
Didn't know that sundays
Could be useful after all
People can be cruel and spineless
Hung around your house
Waiting for your mother
Rachel says she's married to a doctor
Presumed dead
Unsolved child murder
If I die before my parents die
If I die before my parents die
Better move on with the good stuff
Better move on right away
Sod this town and people's pity
Let's get on with the nitty gritty
Presumed dead
Unsolved child murder
I believe in E.S.P
When you're dealing with a master thief
Headlines scream
He's been missing two weeks
Rachel said
When we find him
We can cure him
We can make him better
Raise him from the dead
Unsolved child murder
Raise him from the dead
Unsolved child murder
Raise him from the deadEmbed
