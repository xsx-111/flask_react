The Child Brides LyricsWhen I first saw the child brides
Two bridegroom boys at their side
Genevieve in union with holy communion
Marianne the younger wife
And the child brides
Went down to the water
Neptune calls out to his daughters
Throw yourself at the tide
I'll see you on the other side
In a loveless marriage - when I was fourteen
All braised knees and black eyes
Then you come round here
With your fancy talk and your big ideas
What have you done with our wives
And the child brides
Went down to the water
Neptune calls out to his daughters
Throw yourself at the tide
I'll see you on the other side
My beautiful child brides
Bride of Christ, bride of Jesus
Bride of the fish when you're fathoms down
And the uncles and the brother
With their Sunday suits on
Search the villages and towns
But the child brides
Went down to the water
Neptune calls out to his daughters
Throw yourself at the tide
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other sideEmbed
