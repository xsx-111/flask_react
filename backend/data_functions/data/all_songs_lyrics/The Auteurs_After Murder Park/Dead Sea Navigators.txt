Dead Sea Navigators LyricsTheir legend lay in tatters
From Perth to John O'Groats
The dead sea navigators
Should've been separated at birth
And of course i love them dearly
And I'll miss them now they're gone
Dead sea navigators
Wished they'd had a son
Even in their heyday
No-one liked them
Anyway
Committed boozers, 4 a.m. shivers
This one goes out to those not with us
John the barman and mickey green
This one goes out to all the drinkers at the
Red lion
And our friends, though they are few
Angel, Johnny, Pain, Keith, Charity
This one's for you
And what's left of your nerve will get you through
From Brighton down to Eastbourne
Seasick sailors getting tough
Dead sea navigators
Were made of stouter stuff
Golden years
Golden years
No-one liked them
'Cept for us
Season's ending
All night porters
Thy honour defending with
Last orders
All the sunbathers
Staring at the sun
This one goes out
To the invisible children
As yet unborn
And our friends
Though they are few
Overcoat boys with more brains than brawn
This one's for you
And all that sail in the
Dead sea navigators
This one's for you
And all that sail in the
Dead sea navigators
This one's for you
And all that sail in the
Dead sea navigators
This one's for youEmbed
