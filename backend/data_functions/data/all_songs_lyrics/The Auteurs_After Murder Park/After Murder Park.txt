After Murder Park LyricsEsme would you shut the door
And put the oil lamp on the floor
I feel it coming on again
Just like it did on Saturday
Voices after murder park
In the damp in the dark
Maybe we should call the law
And maybe we should call the child's parents
Ooh
Ooh
I'll love you until the end
Hi, hello, what have you been?
God, it's good to hear your voice again
Did you miss your brother
Darling, I will always love you
Lying in a shallow grave
There's a church nearby and a railway
On a bed of mud and wire
Esme find out where the child is buried
(marry the first born, bury the stillborn)
I love you and I always will
We are lying here waiting to be buried
We are lying here and you're losing contact
With the dead
Please don't ask about the future
I am not a fortune teller
I know you're just being civil
But don't get trivial
Uncles I have never seen
Only in my own dead dream
On a bed of mud and wire
Esme find out where the child is buried
Ooh
Ooh
I'll love you until the endEmbed
