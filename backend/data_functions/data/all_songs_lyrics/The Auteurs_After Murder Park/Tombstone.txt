Tombstone LyricsTaking out the garbage
At the Columbia hotel
Nobody got a ticket
Out of cripple town
Better call suspension
Bakelite and dial
We'll take the fucking building out
Baader Meinhof style
Every day, every hour, every moment
Every dawn to sundown
Everybody's gonna get it, yeah
In tombstone
Every day, every hour, every moment
For the rest of the year
Everybody's gonna get it, yeah
Tombstone is here
Like to thank my mother
For inventing rock and roll
I'd be lost without it
I would not be whole
Honeymoon is over
Waiting for the cops
Sitting shitfaced in Dan's car
Thinking 'bout who we're not
Every day, every hour, every moment
Every dawn to sundown
Everybody's gonna get it, yeah
In tombstone
Every day, every hour, every moment
For the rest of the year
Everybody's gonna get it, yeah
Tombstone is here
Tombstone
Tombstone have a gun
Everybody's got women and children
All tied up for fun
Got to see a doctor
I wanna turn my bones to milk
Nobody ever found
The gold upon the hill
And I wanted glamour
Not tragic rock 'n roll
And I want a lover
Who'll nail me to the wall
Every day, every second, every hour
Every dawn to sundown
Everybody's gonna get it, yeah
In tombstone
Every day, every second, we're related
For the rest of the year
Everybody's gonna get it, yeah
Tombstone is hereEmbed
