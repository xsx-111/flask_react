Stolen Moments LyricsI used to drink a lot in those days, you see
Yeah that's the way the wind blows
These days the only bar I ever see
It's got lettuce and tomatoes
I get pumped up in the back of my mind
Start thinking those days were the best of times
But I never look forward to looking back
I can see a little daylight coming through the crack
So don't you know we're living in stolen moments
Steal enough, it feels like we're stopping time
These days are gold
We're living in stolen moments
Just grab ahold
These days are yours and mine
Well some guy told that, you couldn't dance
And you been carrying that forever
I'm the kinda fella needs a- a second chance
C'mon baby, let's bugaloo together
I see you over there
Just clinging to the wall
Cause they told you you're like ivy
You were bound to crawl
But your kept looking up and baby I know why
Cause you knew someday you gunna touch the sky
So don't you know we're living in stolen moments
Steal enough, it feels like we're stopping time
These days are gold
We're living in stolen moments
Just grab ahold
These days are yours and mine
I couldn't dream this life I'm living
Somehow we just survive and every waste of time forgiven
Now I'm out in the backyard
Leaning on a tree
I have no way of knowing
Can't lead too hard
That's my philosophy
But man that tree is growing!
Maybe I'll never grow up to be straight and tall
But you can lean on me
Baby I won't fall
Maybe in the deal I could learn to bend
Listen like that tree
Baby like a good friend
So don't you know we're living in stolen moments
Steal enough, it feels like we're stopping time
These days are gold
We're living in stolen moments
Just grab ahold
These days are yours and mine
So don't you know we're living in stolen moments
Steal enough, it feels like we're stopping time
These days are gold
We're living in stolen moments
Just grab ahold
These days are yours and mineEmbed
