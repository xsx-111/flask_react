Through Your Hands LyricsYou were dreaming on a park bench
'Bout a broad highway somewhere
When the music from the carillon
Seemed to hurl your heart out there
Past the scientific darkness
Past the fireflies that float
To an angel bending down
To wrap you in her warmest coat
And you ask, "What am I not doing?"
She says "Your voice cannot command
In time, you will move mountains
And it will come through your hands."
Still you argue for an option
Still you angle for your case
Like you wouldn't know a burning bush
If it blew up in your face
Yeah, we scheme about the future
And we dream about the past
When just a simple reaching out
Might build a bridge that lasts
And you ask, "What am I not doing?"
She says "Your voice cannot command
In time, you will move mountains
And it will come through your hands."
So whatever your hands find to do
You must do with all your heart
There are thoughts enough
To blow men's minds and tear great worlds apart
There's a healing touch to find you
On that broad highway somewhere
To lift you high
As music flying
Through the angel's hair
Don't ask what you are not doing
Because your voice cannot command
In time we will move mountains
And it will come through your handsEmbed
