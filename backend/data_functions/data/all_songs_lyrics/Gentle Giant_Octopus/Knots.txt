Knots LyricsAll in all each man in all men and
All men in each man
He can see she can't, she can see she can
See whatever, whatever
You may know what I don't know
But not that I don't know it
And I can't tell you so you will
To tell me all man in all men
All men in each man
He can see she can't, she can see she can
See whatever, whatever
You may know what I don't know
But not that I don't know it
And I can't tell you so you will have to tell me all
It hurts him to think that she is
Hurting her by him being hurt to think
That she thinks he is hurt by making her
Feel guilty at hurting him by her thinking
She wants him to want her, he wants her to
Want him to get him to want him to get
Him to want her she pretends
He tries to make her afraid by not being afraid
He tries to make her afraid by not being afraid
He tries to make her afraid by not being afraid
You may know what I don't know
But not that I don't know it
And I can't tell you so you will
You may know what I don't know
But not that I don't know it
And I can't tell you so you will have to tell me all
I get what I deserve
I deserve what I get
I have it so I deserve it
I deserve it for I have it
I get what I deserve
What I deserve, what I deserve what I get
I have it so I deserve
He tries to make her afraid by not being afraid
He tries to make her afraid by not being afraid
He tries to make her afraid by not being afraid
He tries to make her afraid by not being afraid1Embed
