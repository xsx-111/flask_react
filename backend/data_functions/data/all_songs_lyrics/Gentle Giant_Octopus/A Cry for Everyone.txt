A Cry for Everyone LyricsRun, why should I run away?
When at the end the only truth certain one day
Everyone dies, if only to justify life
Life, I've lived a thousand lives
And anyone is the right, is the just life
If I could cry, I'd cry for everyone
Doubt, no doubt is all I know
There is no fate, there's no luck, what does that show?
Showing is proof, but proving is nothing but fear
If I could cry, I'd cry then for everyone
Shame, I've hoped two thousand years
But no one knows, so I've cried, crying vain tears
Always too late, too late to cry, cry for everyone1Embed
