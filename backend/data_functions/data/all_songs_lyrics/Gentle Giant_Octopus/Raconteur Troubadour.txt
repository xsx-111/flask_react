Raconteur Troubadour LyricsGather round the village square
Come good people both wretched and fair
See the troubadour play on the drum
Hear my songs on the lute that I strum
I will make you laugh
Revel, Merry-dance
Throw your pennies, then you'll hear
More of
The story-telling half
There's no other chance
Always move on
Raconteur, troubadour
Take the face that you see for the man
Clown and minstrel, I am what I am
All my family, not of my kin
Home, wherever, the place that I'm in
Humors give me wage
Favors for my art
Rising, falling
Everyone struggle on
All the world's a stage
All can play their part
I have chosen
Raconteur, troubadour
Dusk is drawing my story is spun
Dawn is falling my day's work is done
Morning, rested I set on my way
Find new faces to offer my play
I will make you laugh
Revel, Merry-dance
Throw your pennies, then you'll hear
More of
The story-telling half
There's no other chance
Always move on
Raconteur-TroubadourEmbed
