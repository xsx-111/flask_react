Fear and Loathing in Mahwah, NJ Lyrics
Why do you do the things you've done
And how dumb would you have to be
To do them again like I know you're going to
If you're the poet you say you are and beauty's in everything you see
Then how can love exist in a world run by people like you
Because when there's suffering, you're there
From southern trees, you hang them in the air
The world screams out in agony and you don't care
But should the shit hit the fan
I just pray you will not be spared
Fuck you

You took a heart with so much room for love
And filled it with hatred and rage
Until there was nothing left but for it to shrivel up and die
People will tell you that if you don't love your neighbor then you don't love God
But no god of mine would put light in such unrighteous eyes
Now the way we hold each other so tight
Would look more like a noose if held up to the light
Because we betray each other in dreams every night
Now let's never speak of it again, all right

Even now I curse the day, and yet, I think
Few come within the compass of my curse
Wherein I did not some notorious ill
As kill a man, or else devise his death
Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it
Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself
Set deadly enmity between two friends
Make poor men’s cattle break their necks
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night
And bid the owners quench them with their tears
Oft have I digg’d up dead men from their graves
And set them upright at their dear friends’ doors
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters
‘Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead
Tut! I have done a thousand dreadful things
As willingly as one would kill a fly
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
But that I cannot do ten thousand moreEmbed
