My Time Outside the Womb LyricsThe first thing you see is the light
Then you focus on a man in a mask with a knife
As he cuts you away from everything you thought you knew about life
Now you're in your mother's arms, wrinkled and wet
You'll spend the rest of your life trying to hard to forget
That you met the world naked and screaming
And that's how you'll leave it
In Riverside Hospital, on a July morning
With a push and a pull, this is how I found out
I wasn't quite so invulnerable
It put the fear of God in me when I heard my daddy say
"one mistake is all that it takes."
I ended up at Central School, 1993
And met a certain kid named Sarim at the library
He said, "they're ain't nothing about this place that's elementary."
I learned to play the guitar in the seventh grade
In order to convince everyone I was a renegade
That's when I learned, in Glen Rock
Everybody calls a spade a spade
I couldn't fool anyone
I couldn't even fool myself
I was just another book on the shelf, nothing else1Embed
