Arms Against Atrophy LyricsA band trip dance - what could be the harm
But a six week vacation from the use of my right arm
It was just the two hits I remember nothing more
Only Alex hitting the switch and me hitting the floor
We're taking this lying down
The one thing I can stand up for is resting supine on the ground
Mr. McDermott, won't you help me to my feet
Because the drumline's going wild in the San Francisco streets
The long walk home, is an hour and a half
But it quickly turns to three or four with stops at every underpass
But by June 22nd, I have done the math
That's a hundred and five liters I'll consume of Dr. Path
Some girls will tell their secrets to anyone
The word "love" gets thrown around a lot near graduation
So please don't whisper sweet nothings in my ear
When the sound of shredding vocal chords is what I want to hear
Because we're going to San Francisco and I forget to wear some flowers in my hair
She's got a secret surname that nobody knows with the most gorgeous hyphen
You wouldn't believe the way it glows
And I'm the only one who gets to see it way up close
So the rest of you can stick it up your nose
Last night, I had the strangest dream that I have ever known
My mother, in a fit of rage, chases me from our home
My mother, the murderer holds me down in the road
She's got the nail clippers at my throat
Even though things lately may have been real horror-show
I'm wishing I was back in-utero
I'd like to go back to the way that things were before, but apparently
I'm looking at physical therapy
It won't be exactly how it used to be
It ain't hard to see that it's not that way
Not that way anymore
Jesus Christ is suffering upon his cross tonight
I just sit outside waiting for frost to bite
"It's always this way," she says on her way out the door
Wait and see
The rest is yet to reveal itself to meEmbed
