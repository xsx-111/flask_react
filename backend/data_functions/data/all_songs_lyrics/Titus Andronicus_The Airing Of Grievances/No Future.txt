No Future Lyrics
Just give me a suitcase and I’ll promise to not look back
Just point me, point me towards the railroad track
I’ve been staring at the gates, but I’ve never found a crack
So I’m just looking up, saying, “Deliver me a heart attack.”
If you’re weary, I don’t mind sharing the load
Just keep me some company on the road
All I’ve got is a bottle that I ought to leave alone
But it’s the only thing that I can call my own
So I’m saying goodbye, and no, I won’t forget to write
It’s just been too long racing towards a yellow light
And I know that I say this every night
But I don’t think I’ve ever been so tired of life
And if things should not get better, will you wait for me to change
Or will I see you waving goodbye from the window of an aeroplane?
If I told you it was hopeless, would you try to understand
Or will you leave me for a palm tree and its shadows on the sand?
Because I’ve been waiting all year for the temperature to drop
But now I’ve got a fever and I don’t know how to make it stop
There’s still one shoe that hasn’t dropped yet
It’s hanging on by an aglet
This world seems like a nice place to visit
But I don’t want to live in it
There is not a doctor that can diagnose me
I am dying slowly from Patrick Stickles Disease
There is not a medication that can cure what’s ailing me
The only treatment they offer is to hang me from a tree
Life’s been a long, sick game of “Would You Rather”
So now I’m going to medical school – as a cadaver
Now if I could say only one thing with the whole world listening, it would be
“Leave me the fuck alone
Or welcome to the Terrordome.”

Good-times
Good-times are here again

God sent me a vision of the future1Embed
