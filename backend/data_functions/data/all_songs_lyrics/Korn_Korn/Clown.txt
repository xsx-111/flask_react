Clown Lyrics
Life is within my body, alright go
Four I just said (Four) you faggot piece of shit on the ground
Four? Four?
Oh
Hey what are you talking about, Ross?
Hey, the song starts like (guitar and vocalization)
Hey, are you saying so there's no clicks?
Hey, we are recording, now start!
Just fucking do it, dammit!
I get "Twist," I wish we could put "Twist" on the fucking tape
Wanna hear it?
Stupid
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Go!
Okay, you piece of shit

Anger inside builds within my body
Why'd you hit me?
What have I done?
You tried to hit me!

Swing at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy, and you're harder than me
What's with you boy, think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared, to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man!
I don't run around
Trying to be what's not within me
Look into my eyes, I am free
You're just a wannabe!

Swing at me again, if you like
Throw your hate at me, with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy, and you're harder than me
What's with you boy, think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared, to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man!

To come out...
Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown
Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown
Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown
Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown
Clown you ain't shit! Turn around!
And get your face split!
Clown you ain't shit! Turn around!
And get your face split!
Clown you ain't shit! Turn around!
And get your face split!
Clown you ain't shit! Turn around!
And get your face split!
Swing if you like
Throw your hate at me, with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy, and you're harder than me
What's with you boy, think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared, to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man!

I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little7Embed
