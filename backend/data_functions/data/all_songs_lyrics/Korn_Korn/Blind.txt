Blind Lyrics
Are you ready?

This place inside my mind
A place I like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind
Another place I find
To escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind
Deeper, and deeper, and deeper
As I journey to live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner...
Self-esteem is low
How deep can I go
In the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind (I can see I'm going)
I can see, I can see I'm going blind (going blind)
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind!
I'm blind!
I'm blind!
I'm blind!
I'm blind!14Embed
