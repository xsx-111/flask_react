A.D.I.D.A.S. Lyrics
Boning, I see, somehow it always seems
That I'm dreamin' of somethin' I can never be
It doesn't matter to me
'Cause I will always be that pimp that I see in all of my fantasies
I don't know your fuckin' name
So what? Let's...
Screwing might be the only way
That I can truly be free from my fucked up reality
So I dream and stroke it harder
'Cause it's so fun to see my face starin' back at me
I don't know your fuckin' name
So what? Let's fuck!

All day, I dream about sex
All day, I dream about fuckin'

All day, I dream about fuckin'
All day, I dream about sex
Yes, all day, I dream about sex
And all day, I dream about sex
Yes, all day, I dream about sex
And all day, I dream about sex
Yes, all day, I dream about sex
And all day, I dream about sex
Yes, all day, I dream about sex
All day, I dream about sex
All day, I dream about fuckin'
All day, I dream about sex
All day, I dream about fuckin'2Embed
