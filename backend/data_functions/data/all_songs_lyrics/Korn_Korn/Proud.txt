Proud Lyrics
Must you keep looking at me
Before you looked the other way
Must you keep glaring at me
I know you look inside and see what you've made

You took no pride in me
But now I'm your everything
It's finding out you own me
Not all of your gloating

Must you keep looking at me
Now you see what I am
Trust, I knew what it was
I don't forget things, thinking I'm nothing

You took no pride in me
But now I'm your everything
It's finding out you own me
Not all of your gloating

Pride of me, no pride, why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Must you keep looking at me
Before you looked the other way
Trust, I knew what it was
I don't forget things, look what you've made

You took no pride in me
But now I'm your everything
It's finding out you owe me
Not all of your gloating
You took no pride in me
But now I'm your everything
It's finding out you owe me
Not all of these feels1Embed
