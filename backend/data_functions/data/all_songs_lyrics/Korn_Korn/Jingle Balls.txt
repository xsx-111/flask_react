Jingle Balls Lyrics
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh
Over the hills we go
Laughing all the way
Something hit my mind
Something gave me pain
Jingle bells, jingle bells!
Jingle all the way!
Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh
Over the hills we go
Laughing all the way, hahaha
Something hit my mind
Something gave me pain
Jingle bells, jingle bells!
Jingle all the way!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Oh-oh-ohEmbed
