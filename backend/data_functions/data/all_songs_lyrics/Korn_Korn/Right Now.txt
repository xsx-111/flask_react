Right Now Lyrics
I'm feeling mean today
Not lost, not blown away
Just irritated and quite hated
Self-control breaks down
Why's everything so tame?
I like my life insane
I'm fabricating and debating
Who I'm gonna kick around

Right now! (Can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you)
Right now! (I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash you and beat you)
Right now! (I rip apart the things inside that excite you)
Right now! (I can't control myself, I fucking hate you)

I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt, just fucked away
I'm devastated and frustrated
God, I feel so bound
So why do I feel the need?
I think it's time to bleed
I'm gonna cut myself
And watch the blood hit the ground
Right now! (Can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you)
Right now! (I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash you and beat you)
Right now! (I rip apart the things inside that excite you)
Right now! (I can't control myself, I fucking hate you)

You open your mouth again
I swear I'm gonna break it
You open your mouth again
My God, I cannot take it
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up!

Right now! (Can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you)
Right now! (I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash you and beat you)
Right now! (I rip apart the things inside that excite you)
Right now! (I can't control myself, I fucking hate you)

I fucking hate you!
I fucking hate you!
I fucking hate you!
I fucking hate you!
(SHUT!) I fucking hate you! (UP!)
(SHUT!) I fucking hate you! (UP!)
(SHUT!) I fucking hate you! (UP!)
(SHUT UP!)8Embed
