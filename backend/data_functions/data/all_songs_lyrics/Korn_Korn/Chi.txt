Pain!

Buried so far away
Into my life of nothing

Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!

I am so high always
Burying my life so slowly

Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
It opens my mind to feelings
Can't face boredom without something

Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!

Re-entering my head
Feeling like I'm God
With the world around me
Can't you feel this pain?
Reaming through my heart!
Screaming through my voice!
Nothing I can kill!
Screaming a lie I am!
Can't you tear my eyes out?
Can't you take my heart away to heart?
Goodbye
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!

Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
