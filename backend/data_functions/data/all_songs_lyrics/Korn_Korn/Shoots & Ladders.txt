Shoots & Ladders Lyrics
Ring around the Rosies
Pocket full of posies
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down
Ring around the Rosies
Pocket full of posies
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

Nursery rhymes are said
Verses in my head
Into my childhood, they're spoon-fed
Hidden violence revealed
Darkness that seems real
Look at the pages that cause all this evil

One, two, buckle my shoe
Three, four, shut the door
Five, six, pick up sticks
Seven, eight, lay them straight
London Bridge's falling down
Falling down
Falling down
London Bridge is falling down my fair lady
Nursery rhymes are said
Verses in my head
Into my childhood, they're spoon-fed
Hidden violence revealed
Darkness that seems real
Look at the pages that cause all this evil
