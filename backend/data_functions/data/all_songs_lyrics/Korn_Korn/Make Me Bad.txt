Make Me Bad Lyrics
I am watching the rise and fall of my salvation
There's so much shit around me, such a lack of compassion
I thought it would be fun and games, instead it's all the same
I want something to do, need to feel the sickness in you

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad

All I do is look for you, another fix, you need it too
Just to get some sort of attention, attention
What does it mean to you? For me, it's something I just do
I want something, I need to feel the sickness in you

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad
I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad
(Does it make me bad?)
I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again
(Does it make me bad?)
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad
(Does it make me bad?)
(Does it make me bad?)
(Does it make me bad?)
(Does it make me bad?)6Embed
