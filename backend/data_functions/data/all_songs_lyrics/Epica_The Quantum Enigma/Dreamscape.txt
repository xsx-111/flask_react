Dreamscape LyricsTry and define eternity
No beginning and no end
A world upside down
Countless clouds on the ground
I'm a figment of my imagination
Hunt for tricks of light
Thoughts painting colorful dimensions
If we could roam through fantasies
No more dusk and no more dawn
Every little grain of sand
Shapes the endless land
Mirrors showing limitless reflections
Hunt for tricks of light
Thoughts painting new dimensions
You can make our time stand still
Come and breathe the sky
Fly with the wings of true emotion
And this time again
It won't be the same
Silent symphonies
Playing eternally
Every step I take
Every bone I break
Every memory
Shatters sympathy
Hunt for tricks of light
Thoughts painting new dimensions
You can make our time stand still
Come and breathe the sky
Fly with the wings of true emotionsEmbed
