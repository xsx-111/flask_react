The Second Stone LyricsO, ne moriar bis
Oro supplex

Sometimes I feel like my reason is weakening
My inner clock's forcing time to stand still
I'm breaching borders between life and sanity
That's when it all starts to shatter in front of me

(Why don't you)
Liberate me
(Liberate me?)

Sometimes I feel I'm betraying my memory
This time it seems that I'm losing the fight
Finding it hard to be consciously part of life
That's when awareness and dreams start to separate

(It's time to)
Reunite me
(Reunite me)

As time goes by I hide the truth
Cannot stand myself with a broken shell
As time goes by I try to choose
Don't know where to roam in this private hell
Give me relief
Let me believe between sweet fiction and reality
My train of thoughts got lost somewhere along the way
I'm chasing shadows that cross on my path
Repeating visions that dance faster than my mind
Can't stop the rain casting shadows on my parade

(I will not)
Can't defeat me
(Bow to defeat)

As time goes by I hide the truth
Cannot stand myself with a broken shell
As time goes by I try to choose
Don't know where to roam in this private hell
Give me relief
Let me believe between sweet fiction and reality
Ne moriar bis

Another life, another mind close to insanity
Another road, a cryptic code the second stone
All that is left is a cross that's mine to bear
A curse with no ending drenched in anxiety
O, ne discedam bis
Oro supplex

As time goes by I hide the truth
Cannot stand myself with a broken shell
Give me relief
Let me believe between sweet fiction and reality
As time goes by I try to choose
Don't know where to roam in this private hell
Give me relief
Let me believe between sweet fiction and reality
