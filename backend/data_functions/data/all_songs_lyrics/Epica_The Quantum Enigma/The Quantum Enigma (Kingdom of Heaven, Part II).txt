The Quantum Enigma (Kingdom of Heaven, Part II) Lyrics
Visum commutamus
Nihil certum
Qui observat, visi
Pars est
The quantum enigma

All your laws and the assumptions
Leave them all behind
There's no grounds for them right here where time can't go
If we can't move on and keep all leaning on the past
We will regret
We can't get what we wish for
New perspective keep us inspired
The quantum enigma
All the shadows and illusions
We tend to believe
Are creations of our own deceiving mind
If we can't let go and keep chasing satisfying needs
We will not get
How to forget our sapience
New perceptions keep us inspired
Ingenuity is required
When we will look around and see
We will affect the energy
When we observe by any means
We will create reality
We will not find if we don't seek
We will not know if we don't peek
We cannot do if we don't be
Facing our deadlock now
This is our quantum enigma
We'll ignite the fire
That burns under the rain
All that we desire
Is to find our source again
The meaning of life
All dreamscapes and inventions
We tend to believe
Are creations of our own deceiving mind
If we can't let go and keep chasing satisfying needs
We will forget
How to retrieve true wisdom
New perceptions keep us inspired
Ingenuity is required
The quantum enigma
When will look around and see
We will affect the energy
When we observe by any means
We will create reality
We will not find if we don't seek
We will not know if we don't peek
We cannot do if we don't be
Facing our deadlock now
This is our quantum enigma

"Without a voice, the soul is invisible in time and space."
Omne est vigor
Sentimus eum
Sicit concretum
Vigor concrescit
Observatione
Vita est mare
Infinitarum facultatum
Si quae emergant opperiens
Quod inspicimus
Adipiscemur
Each new discovery
That we acclaim
Brings us much closer
To reach our aim
So we will finally see
All of the universe
Exists by being observed
Expanding every day
As we reach further

Let's take this chance to carry on
(We will unravel mysteries)
And take the challenge as it comes
(We will exceed our boundaries)
Let's use this chance to end this strife
(Obliterate anomalies)
Reveal the myths surrounding life
(We will decipher secrecies)

New perceptions keep us inspired
Ingenuity is required
The quantum enigma
When we will look around and see
We will affect the energy
When we observe by any means
We will create reality
We will not find (we will not find)
If we don't seek (if we don't seek)
We will not know (We will not know)
If we don't peek (if we don't peek)
We cannot do (We cannot do)
If we don't be (if we don't be)
Facing our deadlock now
This is our quantum enigma

We cannot find if we do not seek
With our confined capacity
Reveal all mysteries
