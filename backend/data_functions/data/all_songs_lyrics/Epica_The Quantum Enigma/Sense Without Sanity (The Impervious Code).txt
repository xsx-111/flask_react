Sense Without Sanity (The Impervious Code) LyricsSee through the veil

Our perspective on life
Defines everything we reach
Most of us will aim for
All the certainties
Beyond the veil
Our perspective on death
Can manifest in many ways
Some of us stay fearful
Til the end of days
As we believe in what we see
We all assume that this is real

Our experience will just hamper us
(Sense without your sanity)
We've tried to define and intertwine circles
(Circles of your life)
Our knowledge will only hinder us
(Sense without your sanity)
We've tried to conceive and interweave the cycles of life
(Cycles of your life)
Death will ease us
See through the veil

Our perspective on birth
Defines how we honor life
An aesthetic wonder
Blessed with splendid eyes
As we believe in what we see
We all assume that this is real

Sense without your sanity
Perceive a new reality
Your heart is guiding you into
Blessedness, we will pull through
"The longer you wait for the future, the shorter it will be."

We're searching for the origin
Dig deeper, where we've never been
Carry the light, we should cherish the night
The questions that we cannot solve
We don't know how we should evolve
Carry the light, we should cherish the night
Bring us all to new heights
Our feelings are ready to warm us, to finally heat us up
Our mind will betray us and leave us in coldness, undefined
Our vision of life says what we will experience
Our vision of death defines what we will see
Beyond the veil
Our perspective on life
Defines everything we see
As we all could aim for
A sense of unity
See through the veil

Our perspective on death
Defines how we spend our days
Everyone interprets
Things in different ways
As we believe in what we see
We all assume that this is real

Sense without your sanity
Perceive a new reality
Your heart is guiding you into
Blessedness, we will pull through
(Sense without your sanity)
A changed mentality
(Perceive a new reality)
Do not suppress
(Your heart is guiding you into)
Moments of pure blessednessEmbed
