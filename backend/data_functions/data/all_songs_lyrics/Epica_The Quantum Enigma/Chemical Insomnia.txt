Chemical Insomnia LyricsEverlasting nights leave all views behind
Limits will become less clear and
A misty memory played out in a dream
This endeavor is causing fear
That's why I can't explain
This is stabbing pain
Come undone in nightly rhyming
It's time for me to roll the dice
Absent sanctity is shifting gravity
Addiction's growing faster, making you go insane
Ivory fangs are smiling, you'll have to break the habit
Imprisonment's approaching, catching the savages
The mirror's magic showing chemical insomnia
Don't give in to all of this
Dive into ecstatic bliss
Tame the lion that's hiding the need to be free
Waking sunset finds, making restless minds
Wistful moments need enclosure
A new hysteria is fading gravity
Which is slowly taking over
That's why I can't unwind
All thoughts aligned
Floating on rivers that are drying
I fear the beast is rising high
Your intuition's fading, a thumping sound impedes
The daybreak is awaking chemical insomnia
Don't give in to all of this
Dive into ecstatic bliss
Don't you believe what the sands of time see
Tame the lion that's hiding the need to be free
And the monsters that consume your energy
Your barbaric puppets live between the cracks of lies from hate revived
Silver secrets shining through the night
An enslaved fool in search of burning light from medicine contrived
Golden treasures turning off the lights
Forbidden fruit tastes better when it can numb the brain
The outcome of the future is looking quite insane
White bricks and darkened stones are building the fundament
The silence's calling out for chemical insomnia
Don't give in to all of this
Dive into ecstatic bliss
Tame the lion that's hiding the need to be free
And you should not believe what the sands of time see
Free the lion that's hiding your identity
Fight the monsters that consume your entityEmbed
