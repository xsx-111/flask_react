Reverence (Living In The Heart) LyricsAn overactive mind where a thousand thoughts come floating by
Will not be able to slow down at time
Don't be afraid, live in the now, enjoy simplicity
Avoid incentives that will make you blind
Don't let it burn you down
Live in the heart
Experience the now
To really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
Life is always challenging
To really find yourself, you can't be blind to signals you obtain and gain
Thoughts are slowly changing here
Here in the now if you identify with your own heart
Will change your views and make you feel at home
You're not your thoughts, observe how the can be duplicity
Don't follow those that make you drift away
Don't let them pull you down
Live in the heart
Experience the now
To really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
Life is always challenging
To really find yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
Life is always challenging
To really find yourself, you can't be blind to signals you obtain and gain
Thoughts are slowly changing
Reward yourself
To really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
Life is always challenging
To really find yourself, you can't be blind to signals you obtain and gain
Thoughts are slowly changing
To really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself
Life is always challenging
To really know yourself, you can't be blind to signs you gain
Thoughts are always ranging nowEmbed
