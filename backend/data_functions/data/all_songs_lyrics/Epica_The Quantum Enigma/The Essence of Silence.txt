The Essence of Silence LyricsSomething is wrong
My strength has gone
Thoughts are corrupting my mind
I can see I perceive this ain’t me
Something so strong
My mood has swung
I can’t get it out of my head
I believe that my mind misleads me
(We confuse)
Is it a doubt you try to hide?
(Tangle and abuse)
Just have an open look inside
(We appear)
It’s just a dreary memory stuck in your mind
(Memory stuck in your mind)
Retrieve your balance
Use your senses to observe
(The essence of silence)
Search for essence
Find the silence within you
(The essence is…)
You’re searching and bursting
There seems to be no cure
When tension endures
Delusions corrupting my mind
I can see I perceive this ain’t me
There seems to be no way
When light fades to grey
To get them all out my head
I believe that my mind misleads me
(We confuse)
Is it a doubt you try to hide?
(Tangle and abuse)
Just have an open look inside
(We appear)
It’s just a dreary memory stuck in your mind
(Memory stuck in your mind)
Retrieve your balance
Use your senses to observe
(The essence of silence)
Search for your essence
Find the silence within you
(The essence is…)
Make a start
Explore your heart
When a persistent memory
Penetrates deep in your mind
Allow the silence to destroy
Your thoughts in every kind
(We confuse)
Is it a doubt you try to hide?
(Tangle and abuse)
Just have an open look inside
(We appear)
It’s just a dreary memory stuck in your mind
(Memory stuck in your mind)
Retrieve your balance
Use your senses to observe
(The essence of silence)
Allow the silence
To wipe your thoughts away
Retrieve your balance
Use your senses to observe
(The essence of silence)
Search for essence
Find the silence within you
(The essence lies IN SILENCE)Embed
