Natural Corruption LyricsNatural corruption
Another day passed by in ruined paradise
Another night will pass until we're sheltered
We're aiming for a life that won't be compromised
And when we say goodbye it's devastating
Now that we have finally realized
Realized, petrified
That profit's made from innocent demise
Profit's made from tragic demise
Another day goes by where money won't suffice
A massive gift was meant as contribution
Our conscience comes to aid that ends up in wrong hands
And once the truth's revealed, intent is fading
Now that we have come to realize
Realized, sanctified
Our hearts subdued by all those thousand cries
Hearts subdued by all those fierce cries
In moments of deadly gloom
Young lives ended way too soon
The facts that are all untrue
Spread lies that wew not thought through
Fight off the catastrophes
Find true inned sanctity
In modern society
Welfare is stained, time to come clean again
Feast on sheer agone
Lean on generosity
Pay in full, it all will vanish without care
Grant us higher proceeds
We'll ease your mind, guaranteed
We should all be reaching out to the despaired
Natural corruption
Charity
Can you believe it
How nature's left its trace
Could we foresee it
What skies erased
We all are trying
We all are dying in nature's arms...
In moment of deadly gloom
Youg lives ended way too soon
The facts that are all untrue
Spread lies that were not thought through
Fight off the catastrophes
Find true inner sanctity
In modern society
Nothing to hide, lives to obtain
Welfare is stained, time to come clean againEmbed
