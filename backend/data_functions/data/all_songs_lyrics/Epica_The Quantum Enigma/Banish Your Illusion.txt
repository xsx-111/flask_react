Banish Your Illusion LyricsWhen all hope is gone
Our world will fall to pieces
Visions are defeated and beaten
All our dreams will come to an end
Cannot pretend
Another chance for this dominion
A rose reborn through new opinions
Show progress with firm deeds
Fulfill our wishes and needs
A sovereign came forth from ashes
A savior who would lead the masses
Entrance us with wise words
And shine your light upon us
Show progress with firm deeds
Grant us our wishes
Can you save us now our world will end
Crave us now 'cause no one's daring
Liberate the promised land
The tables will be turning
The time has come to free ourselves
Can't you banish your illusion now?
Another chance, a prophecy told
A bliss arose, the sound of new hope
Entrance us with wise words
And shine your light upon us
Show progress with firm deeds
Grant us our wishes
Can you save us now our world will end
Crave us now 'cause no one's daring
Liberate the promised land
The tables will be turning
The time has come to free ourselves
Won't you banish your illusion now?
When all hope is gone
Our world will fall to pieces
Visions are defeated and beaten
All our dreams will come to an end
Cannoy pretend
Dropped in a field of enemies
Fear won't get another chance
Can you sense how provoked sly snake conspire?
Beware of the stab
Your back will be the target
This fierce retribution won't expire
Be prepared!
Can you save us now our world will end
Crave us now 'cause no one's daring
Liberate our promised land
The tables will be turning
Save us now there won't be peace
Waive your hope 'cause no one's caring
Sail away across the seas
The promise will be bruning
The time has come to face the facts
We're on the edge of a relapse
Will you banish your illusion now?
When all hope is gone
Our world will fall to pieces
Visions are defeated and beaten
All our dreams will come to an end
Emancipate all of this reprobate landEmbed
