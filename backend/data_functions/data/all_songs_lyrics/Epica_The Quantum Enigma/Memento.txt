Memento LyricsA soul in flames inventing crime
A soul at pace against new times
Her face in red out rules the law
The eyes got caught in devil's claws
Entice me
Beguile me
Lost track of my own sanity
Behind me a souvenir
My conscience will show no remorse
Keep on losing intrinsic battles
You'll be suffering
Your atonement will keep you captive
I will feed the beast
Losing battles
Poisoned apples
Did you find what you're looking for?
In secret silence
Practiced violence
Name the damned
Gravitating around the fire that burns the sand
A soul in flames invents the hunt
Ignite me
What's left of me
I relish your sweet innocence
Their graces enlighten me
Detaining the sins of our past
Keep on losing intrinsic battles
I'll come back for more
Did you find what you're aiming for?
In secret silence
Practiced violence
Name the damned
Gravitating around the fire that burns the sand
The secret shining keeps on turning
Imprisons me
A soul in flames inventing crime
A soul at pace against new times
See
Horrid nights
Turn down their lights
Sacrificed
Losing battles
Poisoned apples
Did you find what you're asking for?
In secret silence
Practiced violence
Name the damned
Gravitating around the fire that burns the sand
The secret shining keeps on turning
Imprisons me
Chasing hunger, a demon's thunder
Is wounding lambsEmbed
