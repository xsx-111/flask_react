Canvas of Life LyricsA thousand signs declined
That traveled through light
Translate this mystery
That covered my eyes
Accept approaching fear
And courage appears
Death is a certainty
It's growing near
Letting go is fateful
Uniting broken rhymes
That visions divide
Painting my memories
That colored my life
Somewhere safe and sheltered
Saved forever
Stuck in the light of day
Waiting for answers
A seed that grew into branches
Another page has turned, ended a letter
Come on home and return to the canvas of life
Shapes and boundaries
Will not disappear
Detangle the misery
And enter new spheres
Facing right and wrong
While waiting for life
Can't change this destiny
The curtain's close by
While your leaves descended
Earth starts to unfold
Stuck in the light of day
Waiting for answers
A seed that grew into branches
Another page has turned, ended a letter
Come on home and return to the canvas of life
You're falling down
While my fortune's alive
We're safe and sound on the ground
Time to found new memories
The stains come alive where the paint has gone dry
You float above looking down reaching out to me
Depicting a beautiful scene that shapes divinity
Stuck in the light of day
Waiting for answers
A seed that grew into branches
Another page has turned, ended a letter
I'll come on home
I'm in the light of day
Questions were answered
A new life's arms are extending
The final page has turned, sending the letter
Come on home
And I'll sing you the song that has painted your canvas of lifeEmbed
