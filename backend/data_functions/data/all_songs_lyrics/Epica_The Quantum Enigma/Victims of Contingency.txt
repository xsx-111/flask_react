Victims of Contingency Lyrics
Your words are meaningless, as pain fills the void
(Hollow words won't hurt no longer)
You will regret every life you've destroyed
(Blaming the whole world will never make you stronger)
Be prepared for the righteous self!

If you blame all your failures on someone else
Without any remorse
(Without your remorse)
If you don't face the weakness of your own self
You will take the same course
(You'll take the same course)

Your deeds are reasonless, you adore yourself
(Empty deeds impress no longer)
You will regret everyone you've envied
(Blaming it on life will never make you stronger)
Be prepared for the confrontation!

If you blame all your failures on someone else
Without any remorse
(Without your remorse)
If you don't face the weakness of your own self
You will take the same course
(You'll take the same course)

If you blame all your failures on someone else
You avoid every chance
(You've lost your last chance)
To learn from yourself

If you blame all your failures on someone else
Without any remorse
(Without your remorse)
If you don't face the weakness of your own self
You will take the same course
(You'll take the same course)

We can't blame all our failures on someone else
For our own protection
(So much to protect)
We can't learn from decisions in our own lives
Without self-reflection
(We will never flee from contingency)
We will never flee from contingency!Embed
