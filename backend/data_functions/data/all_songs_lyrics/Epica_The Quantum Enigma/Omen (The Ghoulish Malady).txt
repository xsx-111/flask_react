Omen (The Ghoulish Malady) Lyrics
This omen
Deceive us
Misfortune unites us all
When it seems like the world is shattering
Remember that you set your course
When it feels like no one is answering
Revert to your deep inner force
As the bell begins to chime
Together we'll be strong
To defy all that can't bring us down
United standing strong
You will not fight alone
This omen
Deceive us
Misfortune unites us all
When it seems like you're always giving in
Make sure that you take back control
When you can't stand the world we're living in
Remember that you're not alone
As your words are carved in stone
Together we'll be strong
To defy all that can't bring us down
United standing strong
You will not fight alone
Don't drown in a sea full of sorrow and pain
United standing strong, here is where you belong

Your angels will whisper
Nothing is what it seems to be
Search with your heart and you'll find the key
You'll see

Together we'll be strong
To defy all that can't bring us down
United standing strong
You will not fight alone
Don't drown in a sea full of sorrow and pain
United stanting strong, here is where you belong
This omen
Deceive us
Misfortune unites us all
Disaster
Nothing can bring us down
Can't beat us
Together we stand strong
Misfortune
You will not fight alone
Can't bring us down
As one we'll overcome
It unites us all in life
All misery we face in lifeEmbed
