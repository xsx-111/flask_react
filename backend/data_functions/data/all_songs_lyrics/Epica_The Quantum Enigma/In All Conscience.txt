In All Conscience Lyrics
Allow me to write my final words
I can't stand this anymore
Hold me when the time has come
Cause I don't want to be alone

In my heart you're still here, it's the bond that we share
I can feel you're around everywhere
Even though you are gone, our spirit is strong
We're honoring all the work that you've done

When there's no chance for our defense
I'll have to bend and give it all
(Each angle will give a new view)
All that I've been standing for
Was an illusion after all
(As both sides should always be heard)

In my heart you're still here, it's the bond that we share
I can feel you're around everywhere
Even though you are gone, our spirit is strong
We're honoring all the work that you've done
I'll see you somewhere again
Away from all the insanity
We can't beat injustice now and for all
I'll see you somewhere again
Away from humanity
We can't beat unfairness now all alone

Even though you are gone, our spirit is strong
I felt you all around alone

In my heart you're still here, it's the wound that we share
I can feel you're around everywhere
Even though you are gone, our spirit is strong
We're honoring all the work that you've done

I'll see you somewhere again
Away from all the insanity
We can't beat injustice now and for all
I'll see you somewhere again
Away from humanity
We can't beat unfairness now all aloneEmbed
