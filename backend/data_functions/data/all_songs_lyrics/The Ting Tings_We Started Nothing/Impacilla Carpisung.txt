Impacilla Carpisung LyricsImpacilla Carpisung
We on me for when it's on
People are there waiting to
Even if you're on it
We aren't everything you do
Now up and I'll be on
And I'll be to into your arms
Until move on and I'll be punk
Holla point until you turn onto your top
On a top
I can see if on a weekend that you're on
I can only find a weekend that ain't to tough
Impacta
When I'm on it
Going all my heart
I am doing
By and tee
When's your on and
By your arm and tee
And see it up and I'll be up
And I'll be something an some(thing)
An to on and to your arm
And I'll be punk
Holla to an everything
That I'm about
Holla to
I can see if on a weekend that you're on
I can only find a weekend that we can see ain't to tough
Oh...oh oh...
Woo..woo woo...
I am doing
By and tee
When's your on and
By your arm and tee
And see it up and I'll be up
And I'll be something an some-(thing)
-an to on and to your arm
And I'll be punk
Holla to an everything
That I'm about
Holla to I can see
If every weekend that you're on
I can only find a weekend that we can see ain't to tough
(repeat these four lines four times total)
Can you hear it?
It's all around
Say can you hear it?
It's all around
Go
Oh... oh oh...
Woo... woo woo...
