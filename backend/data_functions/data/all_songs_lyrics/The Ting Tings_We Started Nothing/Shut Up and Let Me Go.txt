Shut Up and Let Me Go Lyrics
Hey!

Shut up and let me go
This hurts, I tell you so
For the last time you will kiss my lips
Now shut up and let me go
Your jeans were once so clean
I bet you've changed your wardrobe since we met

Now, oh, so easily you're over me
Gone is love
It's you that ought to be holding me
I'm not containable
This time love is not sustainable

I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
Shut up and let me go
Hey!

Shut up and let me go
This hurts, what I can't show
For the last time you have me in bits
Now shut up and let me go
For fear of living in regret
I've changed since from when we first met
Now, oh, so easily you're over me
Gone is love
It's me that ought to be moving on
You're not adorable
I want something un-ignorable

I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
Shut up and let me go
Hey!

Oh, love
Hold this
Hey!
Hey!

Shut up and let me go
This hurts, I told you so
For the last time you will kiss my lips
Now shut up and let me go
Hey!1Embed
