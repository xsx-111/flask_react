Traffic Light Lyrics
Don't you be a traffic light
Don't you be a traffic light
With all things said
You turn to red
Don't you be a traffic light

And don't you be a roundabout
No, not another roundabout
We've come so far
Yet back to the start
Don't you be a roundabout

Oh now baby
Don't misread the signs
If you just turn the key
Then things will turn out fine

Let's not have a breakdown
No, not another breakdown
You're on your own
A long way from home
Let's not have a breakdown
Don't misread the signs
If you just turn the key
Then things will turn out fine

You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
First placing me
Not chasing me
Back home
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
First placing me
Not chasing me
Back home
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
First placing me
Not chasing me
Back home
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
First placing me
Not chasing me
Back home
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
First placing me
Not chasing me
Back home 
 
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
First placing me
Not chasing me
Back home
 
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
First placing me
Not chasing me
 
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
First placing me
Not chasing me
 
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
First placing me
Not chasing me
 
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
First placing me
Not chasing me 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
 
 
 
 
 
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
 
 
 
 
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You're pushing me
You're breaking
Overtaking me
You're racing 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We've come so far
Yet back to the start
 
Don't you be a traffic light
 
 
 
 
 
With all things said
You turn to red
 
Don't you be a traffic light
Have a nice day now
Don't let me downEmbed
