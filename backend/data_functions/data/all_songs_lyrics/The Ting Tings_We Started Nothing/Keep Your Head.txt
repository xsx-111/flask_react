Keep Your Head Lyrics
The room's green
It's got writing on the wall
It's got one chair, it's kinda small
Dirty shoes
Running past the door
And then you go 'round, beat yourself up

Ten minutes to go
And I wanna go home
Ten minutes to go
Yeah, I got to go home
Ten minutes to go
And the air, it don't feel clear
Everybody disappear
You're in it on your own

Fourteen
Intimidated, and she's just fourteen
She's getting pulled from the opposite side
Until it breaks down
Blame it on the wrong crowd
Statement make-up, hair dye
Ten minutes to go
You know she should have gone home
Ten minutes to go
Yeah you should have gone home
Ten minutes to go
And the air, it don't feel clear
Everybody disappear
You're in it on your own

You can't sleep
You know it's over but you just can't sleep
You've gotta face it, gotta go outside
And do the day walk
Living with the lights off
Ain't nobody home

Ten minutes to go
You know you wanna stay home
Ten minutes to go
Yeah you wanna stay home
Ten minutes to go
And the air, it don't feel clear
Everybody disappear
You're in it on your own
Keep your head
Keep your head
Just keep your head
Keep your... headKeep your head
 
 
Keep your head
 
Keep your head
 
Keep your...
 
HeadYou wanna keep-ah
Keep it on the right side
If you know you're gonna be
Coming off it's gonna make you
Open your eyes
I said now, open your eyes
You know it
You wanna keep-ah
Keep it on the low side
This you gonna see ten minutes to go
And your keeping it heads up
Keep it low, be right
Push it kinda low
So, open your eyesEmbed
