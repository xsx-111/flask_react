Be the One Lyrics
You say it's not what you do
It's what you're thinkin' of
Well, I think it's just an excuse
It's what you put across

'Cause I don't wanna be the one
Only overjoyed
Yeah I don't wanna be the one
Makin' all the noise
Yeah I don't wanna be the one

So make sure you're thinkin' it through
You've let me down again
Offer me somethin'
I know you really meant

'Cause I don't wanna be the one
Only overjoyed
Yeah I don't wanna be the one
Makin' all the noise
Yeah I don't wanna be the one
Hey
What you gonna offer now?

'Cause I don't wanna be the one
Only overjoyed
Yeah I don't wanna be the one
Makin' all the noise
Yeah I don't wanna be the one
Hey

What you gonna offer now?
What you gonna offer now? 
What you gonna offer now?
 
 
 
 
What you gonna offer now?This was not my idea
Don't you keep me waitin'
This was not my idea
Don't you keep me waitin'
This was not my idea
Don't you keep–Embed
