Fruit Machine Lyrics
You keep playing me like a fruit machine
Puttin' in change systematically
Winning streak that you had over me
Has turned into your broken tragedy
Turn your pockets out onto the street
Now you see you've spent it all on me
You see my true colours out of synch
Now you're skint, here's a pair of sympathies

You've hit the button one hundred times before
Now feel the fever as I leave you wanting more
You thought you could turn and walk away
Taking chances that weren't yours to take
Win, I don't think so my foolish boy
Watch the next one taking all the joy
Hold me, nudge me, spinning me around
Where's the money? Can't hear that clinking sound

Ka-ching, ka-ching, boy
Ka-ching, ka-ching, boy
Ka-ching, ka-ching, boy
Ka-ching, ka-ching, boy
You keep playing me like a fruit machine
Overstretch your generosity
Thought of bandits leading you astray
The little we had, you've thrown it all away
Go! Go! Go!
Yeah, you're on a roll
Go! Go! Go!
Yeah, you're on a low
Go! Go! Go! 
Ka-ching, ka-ching, boy
 
Ka-ching, ka-ching, boy
 
Ka-ching, ka-ching, boyYou find it hard to stop it
Yeah you're running like a steam train
(I like the way you do that)
Where's the money? Can't hear that clinking sound
Ka-ching, ka-ching!
 
Ka-ching, ka-ching!  
Ka-ching, ka-ching, boy
 
Ka-ching, ka-ching, boyGo!

Ka-ching, ka-ching, boy
Ka-ching, ka-ching, boy

You keep playing me like a fruit machine
You keep playing me like a fruit machine
You keep playing me like a fruit machine
You keep playing me like a fruit machine

Ka-ching, ka-ching!
Oh ka-ching, ka-ching!
Ka-ching, ka-ching!
You find it hard to stop it
Yeah you're running like a steam train
Ka-ching, ka-ching!
Ka-ching, ka-ching!
You keep playing me like a fruit machineEmbed
