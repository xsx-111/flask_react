Great DJ Lyrics
Fed up with your indigestion
Swallow worries one by one
Folks got high at a quarter to five
Don't you feel your growing up undone?
Nothing but the local DJ
He said he had some songs to play
What went down from this fooling around
Gave hope and a brand new day

Imagine all the girls
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
And the boys
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
And the strings
Ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee
And the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums
The drums, the drums, the drums, the drums
The drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, oh!

Nothing was the same again
All about where and when
Blowing our minds in a life unkind
You gotta love the BPM
When his work was all but done
Remembering how this begun
We wore his love like a hand in a glove
This preacher plays it all night long
Nothing but the girls
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
And the boys
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
And the strings
Ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee
And the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums
The drums, the drums, the drums, the drums
The drums, the drums, the drums, the drums
The drums, the drums, the drums, the drums
The drums, the drums, the drums, the drums

Imagine all the girls
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
And the boys
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
And the strings
Ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee
And the drums
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-oh
All the girls
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
And the boys
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
And the strings
Ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee
And the drums, the drums, the drums, the drumsEmbed
