We Started Nothing LyricsNo one dropped off waiting in despair
Every time I go there's no one there
So tell me where's the soul, oh, where's the soul
Submit it's all locked up, so hard to loose control
I started nothing, I wish I didn't
I started nothing, I wish I didn't
I started nothing, I wish I didn't
I started nothing, I wish I didn't
Wait on a new gonna bet on one today
How it's only all of us, ifs and buts falling dead
Tell me where's the soul, oh, where's the soul
If it's been a whole day it's time to let it go
I started nothing, I wish I didn't
I started nothing, I wish I didn't
I started nothing, I wish I didn't
I started nothing, I wish I didn't
Now, often we keep givin' in with what they say
We're too open when we're only showed one way
And with the offer open opportunity to do
To make a mighty step, no insoles in my shoes
I started nothing I wish I didn't
I started nothing I wish I didn't
I started nothing I wish I didn't
I started nothing I wish I didn't, hey
Water's cold, the ice is just a face skin deep
For all you know, the ice is just a face skin deep
Water's cold, the ice is just a face skin deep
For all you know, the ice is just a face skin deep
Water's cold, the ice is just a face skin deep
For all you know, the ice is just a face skin deepEmbed
