Lick and a Promise Lyrics
Johnny come lately on a Saturday night
Singing how to go
Backstreet boogie in the house of delight
Where they steal the show
The money come sour but the ladies are sweet
It's a love affair
Whole place rocking, people stomping their feet
A when the gang's all there

He gets his woman every night for free
He's out there rocking like you wouldn't believe
I sing na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

Johnny like to gamble with his lady Louise
She was a blackjack deuces are wild
He got to thinking 'bout his nose in the breeze
Put it there, Johnny looked and he smiled
He started thinking about the fortune and fame
With the young girls down at his knees
He dug the money but forgot all the names
So he knew just how to appease
Lick and a promise
Lick and a promise
Lick and a promise
He gave the ladies a
Lick and a promise
Lick and a promise
He gave the ladies a
Lick and a promise
Lick and a promise
He gave the ladies a
Lick and a promise

Loose change grubber in his early, early years
Had his poor mama pacing the floors
He grabbed a guitar and a couple of beers
Now the crowd keeps screaming for more

He gets his woman every night for free
He's out there rocking like you wouldn't believe
I sing na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, naEmbed
