Home Tonight Lyrics
Now it's time
To say goodnight to you
Now it's time
To bid you sweet adieu

And maybe, drink a cheers to yesterday
And maybe, you'll drink those tears away

So baby, don't let go
Hold on real tight
'Cause I'll be home tonight
Tonight


So baby, don't let go
Hold on real tight
'Cause I'll be home tonight
Tonight
