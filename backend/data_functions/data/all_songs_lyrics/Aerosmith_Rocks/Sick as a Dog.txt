Sick as a Dog Lyrics
Please, I just got to talk to you
Please, a get you your head out of the loo
Please, we're a long, long way from home
Please, you'd turn a young man's face to stone

Sick as a dog, what's your story
Sick as a dog, a cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog, you really ain't that young

Please, you were much to my surprise
Please, you're the lady in disguise
Please, you're the only a friend I got
Please, you'll be the last to see me rot

Sick as a dog, what's your story
Sick as a dog, cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog, because you really ain't that young

Please, it's a shame you're so refined
Please, you was the last thing on my mind
Please, don't be late to take it light
Please, you're gonna fade into the night
Sick as a dog, what's your story
Sick as a dog, cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog, cause you really ain't so young

Take it light
Take it light
Take it light
Say goodnight
Take it lightEmbed
