Get the Lead Out Lyrics
Do you like good boogie?
Like a real boogie woogie
Hear the juke box singing
A-get the dance hall swinging
A-won't you grab my shaker
I got to meet your maker
Oh, get out the lead, get out of bed, get the lead out

(Get ready), I'll show you my fist
(Get ready), take hold of my wrist
(Get ready), we really can't miss
(Get ready)

Um, hey good looking
A-what you got there cooking?
You a young spring chicken
A-make your feet start kicking

No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
(Get ready), I'll show you my fist
(Get ready), take hold of my wrist
(Get ready), we really can't miss
(Get ready)

Um, hey good looking
A-what you got there cooking?

Hey good looking
A-what you got there cooking
You a young spring chicken
A-make your feet start kicking
Boot it out, dance without me

No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
No-no, no-noEmbed
