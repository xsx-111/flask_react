Revenge of the Iceman Lyrics
Asshole, asshole
A soldier I will be
To piss, to piss
Two pistols on my knee
Fuck you, fuck you
For curiosity

What is it to be nothing
And dead before you're born
I want to be a scholar
A mercenary totem
Push down on your head
And blow me bloaty hoe
I came here to be born
I came here not to know

Gang bang! Gang bang!
Bang that bloaty hoe 'cause I'm the Iceman
Gang bang! Gang bang!
Bang that bloaty hoe 'cause I'm the Iceman
The Iceman

What is it to be loved
I want to be a daughter
Itâ€™s better to be God
Than to love you like a brother
There's couples waging war
What is to be for
I want it to become
I want it to be done
Gang bang! Gang bang!
Bang that bloaty hoe 'cause I'm the Iceman
The Iceman
Gang bang! Gang bang!
Bang that bloaty hoe 'cause I'm the Iceman
The Iceman
Gang bang! Gang bang!
Bang that bloaty hoe
Gang bang! Gang bang!
Bang that bloaty hoe 'cause I'm the Iceman
The Iceman

What is it to be man
I think before I bang
She smelled of piss and mice
I came inside her thrice
What is it to be conquered
I put you on the floor
This squat is now your head
Open the fucking door

Open the fucking door
Open the fucking door
Open the fucking door
Open the fucking door
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Gang bang! Gang bang!
Bang that bloaty hoe 'cause I'm the Iceman
The Iceman
Gang bang! Gang bang!
Bang that bloaty hoe 'cause I'm the Iceman
The Iceman
Gang bang! Gang bang!
Bang that bloaty hoe
Gang bang! Gang bang!
Bang that bloaty hoeEmbed
