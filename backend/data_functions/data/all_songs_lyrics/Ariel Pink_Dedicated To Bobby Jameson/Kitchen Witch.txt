Kitchen Witch Lyrics
Make me a man
Make me a man
Make me a man
Make me a man
Make me a man
Make me a man
Make me a man

Oh, do you just want to stay right here?
Oh, do you just want to lay right here, with me?
We could have the time of your life
Cell phones get some reception, oh
Always comes with some celebration, oh
Holding close together in eternity

Oh, she's the ghost in my mind
A ghostly enterprise
Most of any time at all
But she knows she's my one and only imaginary ghost
Oh, she don't know
She don't care, won't go anywhere
She floats above the stairs below
But she knows not to be scared
Of a ghost who isn't there at all
Lazy, lazy boy
Lay down here with me you'll see
Just recline and
Lazy, lazy boy
Spend a lazy day with me

Oh, she don't know
She don't care, won't go anywhere
She floats above the stairs below
But she knows not to be scared
Of a ghost who isn't there at all
Make me a man
Make me a man
Make me a man
Make me a man
Make me a man
Make me a man
Make me a man

Hush now, don't cry
Softly to me, don't cry
Oh, do you just want to stay right here?
Oh, do you just want to lay right here with me?
We could have the time of your life
Our life, our life, our life, our life, our life, our life
Oh, she's the ghost in my mind
A ghostly enterprise
Most of any time at all
But she knows she's my one and only imaginary ghost
Oh, she don't know
She don't care, she won't go anywhere
She floats above the stairs below
But she won't go anywhere
The secret isn't there at all2Embed
