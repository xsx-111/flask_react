Bubblegum Dreams LyricsSkip, Jump, Stop and Run
Skip, Jump, Stop and Run
Bubblegum Dreams
Skip, Jump, Stop and Run
Skip, Jump, Stop and Run
Bubblegum Dreams
Bubblegum Dream, Bubblegum Dreams
Blue as Icee
Bubblegum Neon, Bubblegum Neon
Yellow and Green
No one knows what dreams may come
To get some satisfaction
Tailor suited to your tongue
The cotton candy action
Bubbles drift into your heart
And fill with dreams and dreams and dreams
Bubblegum Bubblegum Bubblegum Bubblegum Bubblegum Bubblegum
Walk, run, turn around, run around, stop and shout
Bubblegum dreams
Bubblegum neon, Bubblegum neon
Yellow and Green
Bubbles filled with dreams of lust
We float away on clouds of love
Over hills and seas and Sun
You know it's bubblegum!
Bubbles filled with passion
In dreams we dream, in dreams we dream
Memories still fill your cup
Of tea and bubblegum dreams
Bubblegum dreams, Bubblegum dreams
Blue as Icee
Sunshine wrapped in rainbows
Passionate scenes abound
Drifting on an island
Bubblegum forms a sound
Hold it in your hand
Pop it in your mouth
On a merry-go-round of make believe
You can go there with me now
Bubblegum dreams, Bubblegum dreams
Blue as Icee
Bubblegum dreams, Bubblegum dreams
Blue as Icee
Bubblegum Neon, Bubblegum Neon
Yellow and Green
Skip, Jump, Stop and Run
Skip, Jump, Stop and Run
Bubblegum Dreams
Bubbles filled with dreams of lust
We float away on clouds of love
Over hills and seas and Sun
You know it's bubblegum!
You know it's bubblegum!
You know it's bubblegum!Embed
