Death Patrol LyricsCome on the streets the death patrol
Taking directives, death patrol
I know a captor when told takes hold
I told our agent "What do you know?"
Patrol! He's our man
He's our man, he's our man
Do-la-di-do, daddy
Do-la-di-do, daddy
He's our man
He's our man, he's our man
They give directives
And we get captured
Do-la-di-do, daddy
Do-la-di-do, daddy
They're on the streets, they're on patrol
Taking directives day by day
I know a captor when told takes hold
I told our agent "What do you know?"
What do you know?Embed
