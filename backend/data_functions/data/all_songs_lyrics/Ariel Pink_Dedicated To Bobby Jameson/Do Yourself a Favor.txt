Do Yourself a Favor Lyrics
Got your favorite cassette in my pocket
It's blank IOU
So do yourself a favor and taste a new flavor
It smells like sage and thyme
So do yourself a favor and have a toast on mine
I can roast you any time

But pop goes the weasel
Bobby's my best friend and I'm the best dressed
And I'm not that sorry 'cause I never came out

Let's keep what happened between us
And you know that I love you
So do us both a favor and delete this conversation
It's not flattering or kind
So do yourself a favor and seek and you shall find
They'll chase you everytime

But pop goes the weasel
Bobby's my best friend and I'm the best dressed
And I'm not that sorry 'cause I never came out
But pop goes the weasel
Bobby's my best friend and I'm the best dressed
And I'm not that sorry 'cause I never came outEmbed
