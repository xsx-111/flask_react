Dedicated to Bobby Jameson Lyrics
My oh mine
Me myself and I
Try not to die
Be kind when you find
Sunshine

High above the crystal rings
Angels of Sunset Boulevard

He was a Tinseltown Tranny
And the mayor of the Sunset Strip
A Tinseltown Tranny
And the mayor of the Hollywood Hills
A Tinseltown Tranny

Safe and sound
What's become of Jameson?
Staring at dawn
Take heed from the sun
Seventy-one

Soar above the black air of signs
And bid goodnight to all the world
He was a Tinseltown Tranny
And the mayor of the Sunset Strip
A Tinseltown Tranny
And the mayor of the Hollywood Hills
A Tinseltown Tranny

So he left town
A dejected bum
An alien
Bobby fell down
A start to make another break
Crazy


My oh mine
Me myself and I
Try not to die
Be kind when you find
Sunshine

High above the crystal rings
Angels of Sunset Boulevard
He was a Tinseltown Tranny
And the mayor of the Sunset Strip
A Tinseltown Tranny
And the mayor of the Hollywood Hills
A Tinseltown Tranny
A mayor of the Sunset Strip
Hey
A mayor of the Hollywood Hills
A Tinseltown Tranny
And a mayor of the Sunset Strip
A Tinseltown Tranny
And a mayor of the Hollywood HillsEmbed
