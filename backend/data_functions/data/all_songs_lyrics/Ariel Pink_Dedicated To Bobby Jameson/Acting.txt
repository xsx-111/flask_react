Acting Lyrics
Yeah
See you tonight
Have fun at Wi Spa
Okay, man
Acting like James Dean
Acting out off-screen
Acting comes naturally, I'm acting out on fantasies, I'm
I'm acting… I'm acting… I'm acting I'm acting
Act exactly as you are
Act just like a movie star
Act just like a part of me
I'm acting out, why can't you see?
We're gonna party to the break of dawn
We're gonna party to the break of dawn
We're gonna party to the break of dawn
We're gonna party to the break of dawn
Acting out, acting out
Acting like James Dean
Acting out off-screen
Acting comes naturally, I'm acting out fantasies, I'm
I'm acting… I'm acting… I'm acting I'm acting
Act exact exactly as you are
Act just like a movie star
Act just like a part of me
I'm acting out, why can't you see?
We're gonna party to the break of dawn (we can do it all night long)
We're gonna party to the break of dawn (we can do it all night long)
We're gonna party to the break of dawn (we can do it all night long)
We're gonna party to the break of dawn (we can do it all night long)

Happy endingEmbed
