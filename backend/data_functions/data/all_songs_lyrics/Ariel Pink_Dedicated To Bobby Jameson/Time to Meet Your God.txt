Time to Meet Your God LyricsTime to meet your God
Time to meet the Lord, thy God
Time to get with God
Time to face the grace of God
Allahu akbar!
Time to meet your God
Time to meet the Lord, thy God
Time to face the grace of God
Time to get with God
Time to face the firing squad
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
God is watching you
At night, tonight, alright, alright
And it's true because
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
He's out there somewhere
And you're face to face to face to face with God
Time to meet your God
Time to meet the Lord, thy God
Time to kill your God
Time to face the firing squad
For you, for you, for you, for you
And you know it cause it's true it's true it's true for you
And behold the human zoo
He's out there somewhere
And you're face to face with God
(Right now...)
Allahu akbar!
Time to meet your God
Time to meet the Lord, thy God
Time to kill your God
Time to face the wrath of God
For you, for you, for you, for you
And you know it cause it's true it's true it's true for you
And behold the human zoo
He's out there somewhere
And you're face to face with GodEmbed
