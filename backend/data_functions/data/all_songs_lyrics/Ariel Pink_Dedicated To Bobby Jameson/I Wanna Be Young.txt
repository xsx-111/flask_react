I Wanna Be Young LyricsI know that it's not okay
That I should be so blind
I know what I want
And I wanna be young
So young, so young
Reenact all our dates
So I can be young while I wait
Don't make me wait, doo doo
It's simple alright
I just need a future
That's blossoming right
I don't have fun
I wanna be young
You're gonna cry when you hit my age
You're gonna cry when you hit my
My baby please... young
So young, so young
Make me play the game
So I can be young while I wait
Don't make me wait, doo doo
I'll stay home tonight
Just need a young cunt
That's possibly tight
I know it's dumb, but
I wanna be young
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ohh
It's been a long time since
Since I've been on this ride
And it all that/my fun - Ooh
I wanna be young
So young, so young
Reenact all our dates
So I can be young while I wait
Don't make wait, doo doo
It's simple alright
I just need a future
That's blossoming right
I don't have fun
I wanna be young1Embed
