Deer Lyrics
Half a year and here you are again
I'd go out in public if nobody ever asked
I sit home and drink alone and hope that bottle speaks
Like you, like us, like me

Half a year again, now it's a whole
February stationery from you on the wall
I sit home and plead the throne to speak, to speak to me
To me, to me, hasn't said a single thing

You're probably too busy with your work
Or am I just excusing you for leaving me alone?
There's nothing in these wooden drawers
To bring you back, to keep me bored
I don't know what to do with me no more

Dear Everyone I Ever Really Knew
I acted like an asshole so I could keep my edge on you
Ended up abusing even those I thought immune
I killed the kingdom with one move and now it's time to move

Dear Everybody That Has Paid to See My Band
It's still confusing, we'll never understand
I acted like an asshole so my albums would never burn
But I'm hungry now, and the scraps are dirty dirt
I'm hungry now, in the scraps of dirty dirt3Embed
