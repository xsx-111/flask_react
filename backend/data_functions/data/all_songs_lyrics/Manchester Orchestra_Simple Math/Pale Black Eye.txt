Pale Black Eye Lyrics
Father, I plead in waves so I don't need you like I used to
Fear and nostalgia say I don't have it anymore

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Bleed from me
Right from me
Bleed from me

I don't have yours or mine
I don't hurt you like I used to
Amy, you must be tired cause when you sleep, you sleep alone
And understand the throne
Cause if he didn't pay what he had paid I'd undeniably become erased

So whatever you want
Take whatever you need
And bite your veins
Bleed your pain
Into me

Goddamn I'm tired of lying
I wish I loved you like I used to
So hold on, you pale black eye
Cause when I sleep, I sleep alone
So whatever you want
No, whatever you need
Take from me
Right from me
From me1Embed
