Virgin Lyrics
Don't move unless you know someone you can move
And I bruise just like anyone would bruise
And I know we've got a long way to go
I know I've got so far

We built this house with our hands, and our time, and our blood
You build this up in one day to fall downward and rust
You built this house with your hands, and your time, and your blood
We built this up in one day to fall downward and rust

And I'm gone
You tried to emphasize and side with both your ghosts
In time I swore I'd take the straight and narrow path but still alone
I hold his ear I'm only trying to do my job tonight
Kiss him on top his lips and crucify the fire

We built this house with our hands, and our time, and our blood
You built this up in one day to fall downward and rust
You built this house with your hands, and your time, and your blood
We built this up in one day to fall downward and...

Never really feel the same
Never gonna be the same
No it's never gonna be the same
It's never gonna be the same
We built this house with our hands, and our time, and our blood
We built this up in one day to fall downward and rust
We built this house with our hands, and our time, and our blood
You built this up in one day to fall downward and rust

Trust in me the same way (with your time, your blood)
Holy or inane (to fall downward and)
Never really feel the same
No, it's never gonna be the same
No, it's never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same7Embed
