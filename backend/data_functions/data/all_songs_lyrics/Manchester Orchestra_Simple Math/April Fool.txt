April Fool Lyrics
I was born an April fool
Full of gold to a brothel
It saved all my sins
I don't care if you and I
Are naked, bare and wrapped up in the sun
All I need is one, one, one...

I don't know where I've been, what I've done
I am the once, now irreplaceable son
I'm the Antichrist in your bones
I've come around this time to let you suck from my soul
And let me go

And by that time, those blinking lights
Controlled my sight and blinded me in spite
And I waited here for you
I don't care to salvage prayer
But a dent so big comes once a few years
And again I'm left to wait for you

And I don't know where I was going
I tried again to break you down for everyone's knowing
Crying, let me go back to my failures
And come around this time to stop and finally let go
Let me go
The leaves are dead, but I am here
And waiting on another good year
I hope we don't lose it all here
I tried once, I tried twice and I'm done
I am the once, and irreplaceable son
I've got that rock, and that roll
I've come around this time to set fire to your bones

I tried once, I tried twice, I'm done
I am the once and finally replaceable son
I've got that rock, and that roll
I've come around this time to set fire to your homes
And let you go

I don't care, so gouge my eyes
I'll spend the rest of my entire life blind
A consequence to you
And I don't care if you and I
Will take the rest of our entire lives
I'm patient here for you5Embed
