Apprehension LyricsFinding out that you had lost the little one inside you
Not a sound, but chalk that you had dropped on the floor
And I could tell that when you fell the future never planned on getting easier
God has never been afraid to fill our cups with more than they could hold
Til they all overflow and we drown once and for all
How could I misconceive I was owed something radically radiant
The doctor came through and asked if you'd like to give it name
How can you misconceive our ideals and growing our futures
Some impressive prize I find for placing all the blame
My apprehension got the best of me
Better now than when I found I used to have the gift of amusement
It's funny how without a doubt the family's far more calmer than me
And I will cause a lovers' court
And you, you don't, you keep on tapping
Sour-mouth, a coward clout, the dormant gospels nativity
My apprehension got the best of me
Walking dead my heart was moldering
Yeah it got the best of me
The best of me
Pushing it out I heard the healthiest move is to abandon all of my blemish
That's what the hospital staff and the pair of our parents will say
Here I am again directly back to the place where Adam ruined family
Running in a marathon of mental til God shows up again
My apprehension got me nowhere
Swimming in my own filth
Yeah got me nowhere
NowhereEmbed
