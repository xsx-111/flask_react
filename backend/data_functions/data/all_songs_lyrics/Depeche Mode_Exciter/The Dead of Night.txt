The Dead of Night Lyrics
We're the horniest boys with the corniest ploys
Who take the easiest girls to our sleaziest worlds
With our lecherous plans in our treacherous hands
You'd be wasting your time saying, "No, it's a crime"

All that we live for, you'll regret
All you remember, we'll forget

We are the dead of night
We're in the zombie room
We're twilight's parasites
With self-inflicted wounds
We are the dead of night
We're in the zombie room
Heavenly oversights
Eating from silver spoons

With our decadent minds and our innocent lines
You'll be playing our games with your bodies in flames
When delirious fun has seriously begun
You'll be down on your knees, you'll be begging us, "Please"
All we're demanding, you'll supply
All we're accused of, we'll deny

We are the dead of night
We're in the zombie room
We're twilight's parasites
With self-inflicted wounds
We are the dead of night
We're in the zombie room
Heavenly oversights
Eating from silver spoons
We are the dead of night
We're in the zombie room
We're twilight's parasites
With self-inflicted wounds
We are the dead of night
We're in the zombie room
Heavenly oversights
Eating from silver spoons

We are the dead of night4Embed
