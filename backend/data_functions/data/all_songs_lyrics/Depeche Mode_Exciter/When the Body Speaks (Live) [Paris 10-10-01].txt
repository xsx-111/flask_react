When the Body Speaks (Live)  Lyrics
"Come a little closer, Martin. Can't feel you back there. Need you closer. Alright."

To the soul's desires, the body listens
What the flesh requires, keeps the heart imprisoned
What the spirit seeks the mind will follow
When the body speaks, all else is hollow

I'm just an angel
Driving blindly through this world
I'm just a slave here
At the mercy of a girl

Oh, I need your tenderness
Oh, I need your touch ("Come on!")
I dream of one caress
Oh, I pray too much ("Alright.")

To the soul's desires, the body listens
What the flesh requires, keeps the heart imprisoned
What the spirit seeks the mind will follow
When the body speaks, all else is hollow
You keep me waiting
For the promise that is mine
Please stop debating
Please stop wasting your time

("Come on, then.") I need your tenderness
I need your touch
I dream of one caress
Oh, I pray too much

"Come on, Martin. Check out the moves. Hey. There he goes. You've still got the moves, Martin. He's trying to move you. It's working for me. Come on. Ssh!"
"Thank you very much."Embed
