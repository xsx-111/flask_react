Comatose Lyrics
Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in and sliding out
Of conscious feeling

Take a light, start the flame
Play the game, woah
I am lost in your eyes
Hypnotised

Here I believe
Dreams never deceive

Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in and sliding out
Life has no meaning

Bodies move, colours change
Girl, you're strange, woah
Here inside, I'm at home
I'm alive
Don't be afraid
I'm floating away

Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in and sliding out
Of conscious feeling

Comatose, almost
Comatose, almost
Comatose
Comatose, almost
Comatose, almost
ComatoseEmbed
