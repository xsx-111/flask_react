Breathe (Live)  Lyrics
I heard a rumour, they travel far
You know what it's like, the way people are
They talk and they talk, though they don't understand
They'll whisper and whisper and lie on demand

Please tell me now, I want to know
I have to hear it from your lips
Say it's not so

I heard it on Monday and I laughed a while
I heard it on Tuesday, I managed to smile
I heard it on Wednesday, my patience was tried
I heard it on Thursday and I hurt inside

Well I want to know the depths of your mind
Tell me this whole thing is madness
And we're doing fine

Put your little hand in mine
And believe in love
Put your head on my chest
And breathe love, breathe love
Breathe love, breathe love
And I heard it from Peter who heard it from Paul
Who heard it from someone I don't know at all
And I heard it from Mary who heard it from Ruth
Who swore on the Bible she's telling the truth
And I heard it from Simon who heard it from James
Confirming with Sarah that I was to blame
And I heard it from Joseph who heard it from John
Who said with conviction that all hope was gone

So I need to know your alibis
I need to hear that you love me
Before you say goodbye
Before you say goodbye
Before you say goodbye
Before you say goodbye

"Thank you."Embed
