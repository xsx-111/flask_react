When the Body Speaks Lyrics
To the soul's desires, the body listens
What the flesh requires, keeps the heart imprisoned
What the spirit seeks the mind will follow
When the body speaks, all else is hollow

I'm just an angel
Driving blindly through this world
I'm just a slave here
At the mercy of a girl

Oh, I need your tenderness
Oh, I need your touch
Oh, I dream of one caress
Oh, I pray too much

To the soul's desires, the body listens
What the flesh requires, keeps the heart imprisoned
What the spirit seeks the mind will follow
When the body speaks, all else is hollow

You keep me waiting
For the promise that is mine
Please stop debating
Please stop wasting your time
Oh, I need your tenderness
Oh, I need your touch
Oh, I dream of one caress
Oh, I pray too much1Embed
