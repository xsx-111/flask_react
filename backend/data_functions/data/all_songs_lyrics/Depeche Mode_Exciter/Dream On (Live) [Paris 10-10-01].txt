Dream On (Live)  Lyrics
As your boney fingers close around me
Long and spindly, death becomes me
Heaven, can you see what I see?
Hey, you pale and sickly child
You're death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile

Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're given, mmh

There's no time for hesitating
Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating
Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without, it lives within you

Feel the fever coming
You're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching, no!
Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?
Dream on, dream on

"Woo! Feel it... Baby! Yeah! Come on!"
"Baby! Oh!"
Mmh, mmh, mmh, mmh

Blame it on your karmic curse
Or shame upon the universe
It knows its lines, it's well-rehearsed
It sucked you in, it dragged you down
To where there is no hallowed ground
Where holiness is never found ("Oh!")

Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're given

"Come on, let's hear you, Paris!"
(Can you feel a little love?)
(Can you feel a little love?)
Dream on, dream on
"Everybody sing it!"
(Can you feel a little love?)
(Can you feel a little love?)
Dream on, dream on
"Oh yeah. That's right. You're feeling the love. I said are you feeling the love?! Woo! Thank you!"Embed
