Dear Darling LyricsWhy would you run ?
I beg stars above
A thing of such beauty
Must be called love
Why would you go
And give me to cry?
A thing of such beauty
Might never die
You bust loose from heaven
And now your life starts
So soon you will see
You've broken two hearts
And when you discover
The love I still know
You'll worry dear darling
Why you had to go
Why would you run?
I beg stars above
A thing of such beauty
Must be called loveEmbed
