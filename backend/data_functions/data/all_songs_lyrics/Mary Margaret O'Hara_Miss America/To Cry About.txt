To Cry About LyricsYou take a walk
I'm by your side
Take my life, I'll give you mine
You, you give me something
To cry about
You're in my heart
I'm in your hand
You drop me off
I miss you and you
You give me something to cry about
Oh, in a pinch you listen to me
You are any scene wants to see
To see
There will be a timed disaster
There's no you in my hereafter
I still feel for you after you go
You, you know better than to cry
Cry about
You're in my heart
I'm in your hand
You drop me off
I miss you and, oh you
You give me something
Oh, this is your art
This is you and
You pick up your cross
Strike up the band
I still fall for you after you go
And you, you know better than to cry
Cry about
Cry about
Cry aboutEmbed
