Help Me Lift You Up LyricsI don't have to tell you that you're all alone
Hear what we will, not go home
You'll have to be with your own kind
I'll have to stay with my own kind
Help me lift you up
So sorry if I can't stop pretending
So sorry if I don't let you go
Like this, but not like this is ending
I think you know
I think you know
Help me lift you up
Help me lift you up
Oh, I have a dream
It's very clear
You're all around
But never near
I have a dream
It's very clear
You're all around
But never near
Oh, help me lift you upEmbed
