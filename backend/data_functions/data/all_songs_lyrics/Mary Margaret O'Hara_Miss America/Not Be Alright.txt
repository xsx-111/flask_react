Not Be Alright LyricsOh, hear a meter in her slow dance
Her clothes still swaying in time with the weather
The tale is tall
Innocent
It won't be alright
Just will not be alright
Just will not be alright
I’m where it is
Or is
Or a day
And it won't come back
It won't
Stay away
And my tale is tall
Innocent to a fault
Will not be alright
Just will not be alright
Just will not
Just will not be alright
You can’t just be
You can't just be
Will not
Just will not be
Alright
Alright
Alright
No curtains on the windows
No covers on the beds
She lays them out on the floor
And she rips them up to shreds
Will not
And you wanna run it
Then you wanna run
Then you wanna run it
As you know never
You know
You know it never will
Ever will it not
Will it not be al-
Will it not be alright
Be alright
Be alright
Be alright
Be al-
Just will not just be
Just will not just be
Just will not just be
Just will not just be
Alright
Then you can't just be al-
Right then can't just be al-
And you can't just be alright
Somewhere her say sorry
Somewhere say sorry, sorry
And it won't
It won't come back
It won't
It won’t stay
Stay away
This tale
The tale is tall
This tale
This tale is tall
Innocent to a fault
Innocent
Innocent to a fault
Innocent
Innocent to a fault
Not be alright
Just will not
It just will no just be
Alright
You can’t just be
Alright
You can't just be
Alright
Be alright
Be alright
Be alright
Be alright
Be alright
The rush is
The rush is
Meter in her dance
Her clothes is still swaying in time with the weather
The rush is
And a meter in her dance
And her clothes
Still swaying in time with the weather
And the weather
And the weather
Just will not just be alright
Just will not just be alright
Oh, the promise to mo-
Promise to move it in
To just move to it
To lead away from
The fall back on it
To pro-
In with the development of the types
And make sure to everyone
It follows
And it won’t
It won't be alright
Just will not be alright
Just will not be alright
It just will not just be
Just will not just
Be alright
Be alright
To laugh
Have fun
To laugh
They have known the falls
Those were above just rolling
And they know
They know it never will it happen
Be alright
Just will not
Be alright
Will not just be alright
You can't just be
You can't just be
Somewhere
Somewhere say sorry
And it won’t come back
It won't st-
Any way
It won't come back
It don't stay away
It won't come back
It don't stay away
It won't come back
It don't stay awayEmbed
