You Will Be Loved Again LyricsHow could he
Take you in his arms and
Help you free
Then leave you forgotten?
And is it enough to cry
When you're so broken?
Her cold eyes
Tell you you're not welcome
She keeps lies
But you'll take her back again
And is it enough to die
When you're so taken?
You will be loved again
You will be loved again
But will sing
And will dance
And will forever
Sometime you will
Feel love so deep
And you'll find someone
Not lost in sleep
You will be loved again
You will be loved againEmbed
