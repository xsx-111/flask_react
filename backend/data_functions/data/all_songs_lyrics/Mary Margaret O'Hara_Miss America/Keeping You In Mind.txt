Keeping You In Mind LyricsNot thinking you
Just having you
But keeping you in mind
And wondering, too
What next you'll do
When you come back next time
You run away
When things go good
I think you won't
Then i knew you would
Are you afraid
Of how we might do?
Don't you think
That i'm worried too?
But if our love is all for naught
I'm still happy with what i've got
Not having you
But keeping you in mind
Just thinking you
Just wanting to
And knowing you'll be here
Whenever you
Forget you know
That i hold you so dear
Don't run away
When things go right
Why won't you stay
And put up a fight?
Or i'll run away
And you'll be true blue
And you'll see what life
Is like without you
And when a memory's all i've got
I'll remember i've got a lot
Not having you
But keeping you in mind
Not having you
But keeping you in mindEmbed
