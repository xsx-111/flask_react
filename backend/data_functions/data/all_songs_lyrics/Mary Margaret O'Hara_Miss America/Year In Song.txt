Year In Song LyricsThe year in song
The year in music
A week in song
A day in song
Joy is the aim
Joy is the aim
Joy is the aim
Now hit those gleaming faces hard
Though they’ll try to miss it
You would do the same for others
Look now it's re-
It’s ready, is it?
Ready to put you under like sedation
The year in song
The year in music
A week in song
A day in song
Joy is the aim
Joy is the aim
Joy is the aim
Sitting on beats all wind-up toys
Sitting on beats all wind-up noise
I'm damn noise and I'm sitting on it
I’m damn noise and I’m sitting on it
I’m sitting on it
Pretty soon too much
Pretty soon too much
Pretty soon too much
Too soon, too much
Too soon, too much
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
The year in song
The year in music
A week in song
A day in song
Joy is the aim
Joy is the aim
Joy is the aim
Joy is the aim
Joy
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Double or nothing
It is all for one and something’s
Ready to blow you up, then I blow it
Treat me I’m getting low
High up where floaters go
Ready to put you under my light sedation
I’m ready to throw you under like sedation
I’m not ready to go under
I’m not ready to go under
Eh pretty
Ape pretty
Ah, that’s too much
Ah I love that
Oh that ta-ta music
Ah, what ta-ta music?
Oh that ta-ta music
What?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?
Is the aim, eh joy?Embed
