Anew Day LyricsThough there are tears round your heart
And your eyes are of stone
Every bright star
Will fade when you come home
Though the ground is wet with sorrow
It will always look that way
Everyone walk in brightness
Cause it's a new day
A new day, a new day
A new day
Spring and the rose again
Will see the living end
When your heart is sick with wonder
At the long and lonely way
Everyone walk in brightness
Cause it's a new day
A new day, a new day
A new day
A new day
Oh dream of mine
Not lost in sleep
I'll call you down
With the love you don't give words to
With the love you give away
Everybody walk in brightness
Cause it's a new day
A new day
A new day
A new day
Ah, Is it better to
Is it better to disappear
Than just to
Than just to stand so near a hole?
When your own hand won't recognize your face
Makes you maybe go someplace
With the tears round your heart
And the stone in your eyes
Look out your change of heart
And look at the same skies
Over ground wet with sorrow
That will always look that way
Everyone walk in brightness
It's a new day
A new day, a new day
A new day
You and the rose again
Will be the living end
When your heart is sick with wonder
At the long and lonely way
Walk in brightness
Cause it's a new day
A new day
A new day
A new day
A new dayEmbed
