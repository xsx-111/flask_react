My Friends Have LyricsI want to get what my friends got
Just physical and some small talk
What's in a name?
No shame for shame
Leave little blame if they then walk
I want to stand where my friends dance
On higher ground, i've a good chance
I'm pretty fool, am loaded dice
Eat it for once, for my friends...twice
And when i am go to sleep
And when i am go to fall
And when i am go to waste
And when i am and that's all
They'll roll i by on a good day
They'll wave their arms and they'll say
Hey! --- you in the lurch...
Watch that...your purse?
You fix your eyes but they won't stay
I want to stay where my friends go
I've got some friends
But they don't know
Oh
When i go to sleep
Then when i go to fall
Then when i go to waste
Then when i am and that's all
I'm going to get what my friends got
I'll give little up
And i'll get a whole plot
What's in a name?
There's no blame...no blame
I'm going to hang where my friends dance
On higher ground we've a good chance
Pretty fool...loaded dice
Once in our life we will think twice
Yah---oh yah
Oh yah?
When we go to sleep
We go to fall
Then when we go to waste
Then when we are and that's all
They'll roll i by
They'll roll i by
Let's roll i by
Let's roll "i" by...why?
Why go to waste...
Why go to waste...
Why go to waste?Embed
