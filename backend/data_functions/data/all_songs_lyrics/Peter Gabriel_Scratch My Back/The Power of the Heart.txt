The Power of the Heart LyricsYou and me, we always sweat and strain
You look for sun, I look for rain
We're different people, we're not the same
The power of the sun
I look at treetops, you look for caps
Above the water, where the waves snap back
I flew around the world to bring you back
It was the power of your heart
The power of your heart
Oh, the power of your heart
All around the world to bring you back
It was the power of your heart
Of your heart
You looked at me, I looked at you
Your sleeping heart was shining through
Wispy cobwebs that we're breathing through
The power of the heart
I looked at you, you looked at me
I thought of past, you thought of what could be
I asked you once again to marry me
The power of the heart
The power of the heart
The power of the heart
All around the world just to bring you home
That's the power of your heart
Of your heart
Everybody says love makes the world go around
I hear a bubble, I hear a sound
Of my heart beating and I turn around
And find you standing at the door
You know me, I like to dream a lot
Of this and that and what is not
And finally I figured out what was what
It was the power of your heart
The power of your heart
The power of your heart
All around the world just to bring you back
It was the power of your heart
Of your heart
You and me, we sweat and strain
But the result, it's always the same
I think somehow we're in again
The power of the heart
I think I'm dumb and I know you're smart
The beating of a purebred heart
I say this to you and it's no lark
Marry me today
You know me, I like to dream a lot
Of what there is and what there's not
But mainly I dream of you a lot
The power of your heart
The power of your heart
The power of your heart
All around the world to bring you back
It's the power of your heart
The power of your heart
The power of your heart
All around the world to bring you back
It's the power of your heart
Finally I figured out what was what
It was the power of your heart
Of your heart
Of your heartEmbed
