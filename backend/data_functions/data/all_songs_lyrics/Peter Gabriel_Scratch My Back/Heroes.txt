Heroes Lyrics
I, I wish I could swim
Like dolphins, like dolphins could swim
Though nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever

Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day
Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive us away

Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day
Oh, we can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember
Standing, standing by the wall
And the guns, shot above our heads
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall
And the shame, the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
And we could be Heroes, just for one day2Embed
