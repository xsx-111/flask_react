Mirrorball LyricsI plant the kind of kiss that wouldn't wake a baby
On the self-same face that wouldn't let me sleep
And the street is singing with my feet
And dawn gives me a shadow I know to be taller
All down to you, dear
Everything has changed
My sorry name has made it to graffiti
I was looking for someone to complete me
Not anymore, dear
Everything has changed
And we made the moon our mirrorball
The streets, an empty stage
The city sirens violins
Everything has changed
So lift off love
Lift off love
We took the town to town last night
We kissed like we invented it
And now I know what every step is for
To lead me to your door
Know that while you sleep
Everything has changed
We made the moon our mirrorball
The streets, an empty stage
The city sirens violins
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
So lift off love
Lift off love (down to you, dear)
Lift off love (down to you, dear)
Lift off love (down to you, dear)
Lift off love (down to you, dear)
Lift off love (down to you, dear)1Embed
