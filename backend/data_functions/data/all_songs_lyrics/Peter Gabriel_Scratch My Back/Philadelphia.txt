Philadelphia LyricsSometimes I think that I know what love's all about
And when I see the light, I know I'll be all right
I've got my friends in the world, I had my friends
When we were boys and girls and the secrets came unfurled
City of brotherly love, place I call home
Don't turn your back on me, I don't want to be alone
Love lasts forever
Someone is talking to me, calling my name
Tell me I'm not to blame, I won't be ashamed of love
Philadelphia
City of brotherly love, brotherly love
Sometimes I think that I know what love's all about
And when I see the light, I know I'll be all right
