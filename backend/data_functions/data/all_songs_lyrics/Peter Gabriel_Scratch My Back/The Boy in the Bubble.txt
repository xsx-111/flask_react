The Boy in the Bubble Lyrics
It was a slow day
And the sun was beating
On the soldiers by the side of the road
There was a bright light
A shattering of shop windows
The bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long-distance call
The way the camera follows us in slow-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
Don't cry, baby, don't cry, don't cry

It was a dry wind
And it swept across the desert
And it curled into the circle of birth
And the dead sand
Falling on the children
The mothers and the fathers
And the automatic earth
These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long-distance call
The way the camera follows us in slow-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
Don't cry, baby, don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

Well, it's a turn-around jump shot
It's everybody jump start
Every generation throws a hero up the pop charts
Medicine is magical and magical is art
Think of the boy in the bubble
And the baby with the baboon heart
These are days of lasers in the jungle
Lasers in the jungle somewhere
Staccato signals of constant information
A loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires, and, baby

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long-distance call
The way the camera follows us in slow-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
Don't cry, baby, don't cry, don't cryEmbed
