Backslide LyricsLos Angeles take your dreams away
Put you on the ground
At the end of the day it's your life, your loss
If you can't turn the clock around
I said, oh, my God, you can have her for that one
So you better not miss a shot
You're letting yourself get into all kinds of danger
Soon enough, you're gonna get caught
They had a feeling
It was like you had to prove you're one in a million
And on top of that junkies are dealing
This time the drugs are you and they'll come through
It ain't gonna stop 'til they get what they want
And I said nobody knows me, I'm all alone
I, I, I, I, I, I, I gotta go
It's a Hollywood bus stop and the party's over
I, I, I, I, I, I, I gotta go
John was havin' his homeboy down, so he waited for a ride
Then waited to confide in Hollywood's constant backslide
With affordable lives and a sunroof, nestled among the filth
Frequencies and bad intentions, gotta take it for what it's worth, but I say
They had a feeling
It was like you had to prove you're one in a million
And on top of that junkies still dealing
This time the drugs are you and they'll come through
It ain't gonna stop 'til they get what they want
And I said nobody knows me, I'm all alone
I, I, I, I, I, I, I gotta go
It's a Hollywood bus stop and the party's over
I, I, I, I, I, I, I gotta go
Have you ever been haunted by your past?
And it will never let you go
Will never ever, ever let you go
No, I said, they'll never ever, ever let you go
Nobody knows me, I'm all alone
I, I, I, I, I, I, I gotta go
It's a Hollywood bus stop and the party's over
I, I, I, I, I, I, I gotta goEmbed
