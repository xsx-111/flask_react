New Dress LyricsWith a gleaming success with the different tribes
Religious indifference mixed with feudal lines
Territorial company, they legitimize
Persecution to form enterprise
Now the UN is called to buffer it all
The problem is spreading international
Like Ireland's Belfast, it's coming to be
A brand new key
Working class girl puts her money to the test
She's got a new dress, she's gonna look her best
Yugoslavia's been blown to bits, yeah
She's got a new dress, she's lookin' to the west
Well  a peaceful end
Til tanks roll down to the old south end
Of a world which is seen the citizens die
While the innocent children play near fire now
When , evidence
Another , permanence
The time for civil war is soon to relive
The chivalrous ones are never represented
Working class girl puts her money to the test, yeah
She's got a new dress, she's gonna look her best
Yugoslavia's been blown to bits, yeah
She's got a new dress, she's lookin' to the west
Allocating people for 
The methods of the summons are dastardly
Try to cleanse the hands of the murdering
But the appendage of guilt is lingering
Shadows of soldiers lay nearby
The dead ones finally reach a compromise
Destruction of war lies in Bosnia
The destruction of war lies in BosniaEmbed
