Hooligans Lyrics
Yeah!
Here's the new face of rock-n'-roll
It's all fighting toe to toe
Hard times come, yeah the hard times go
When I say, come on, come on

All the hooligans and rude boys know one thing for sure
Scars been stricken on their face
All the hooligans and rude boys know one thing for sure
Scars been stricken on their face

One man's decision brings another's opposition completely unbound
Down on the flats where the seaside meets my lonely old town
Well all the rudies and skins well they're out on the streets making their way on the rift
Between the bottles and sex they smash and they wreck for something to live

All the hooligans and rude boys know one thing for sure
Scars been stricken on their face
All the hooligans and rude boys know one thing for sure
Scars been stricken on their face

Sometimes you know there's no place to go but to a long life of crime
Yeah but its so wrong to steal someone's very last meal to profit up a dime
Your poe poes and greys well they end up in jail, gold slingin' cowboys
Well you took a bite outta the apple of decision that got ya there boy
All the hooligans and rude boys know one thing for sure
Scars been stricken on their face
All the hooligans and rude boys know one thing for sure
Scars been stricken on their face

Hooligans and rude boys, I don't want no racial hatred
"Black and white, who are portrayed without bias
These are the people whose voice I want to be..."
I said the hooligans!
Rancid
Rude boys!
Rancid
Hooligans!
Rancid
Rude boys!
Rancid

All the hooligans and rude boys know one thing for sure
Scars been stricken on their face
All the hooligans and rude boys know one thing for sure
Scars been stricken on their faceEmbed
