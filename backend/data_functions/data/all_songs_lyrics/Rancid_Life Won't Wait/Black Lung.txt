Black Lung LyricsSigned arbitration under working condition
Union is in bed with the coal operators
Carry our freedom, lookin' for something
To give your family a better life for every single day
Somethings keep me goin'
Well, I got no one to blame
Five o'clock is comin', do you feel the same?
When the lonely whistle calls out your name
All the men look the same
When they come out the mine
No prejudice for the mighty black lung
Rank and file workers, rank and file minds
So take off the gloves and sock it to 'em
Somethings keep me goin'
Well, I've got no one to blame
Five o'clock is comin,' do you feel the same?
When the lonely whistle calls out your name
Hey unbeliever, black lung fever
Transmit receiver, stand up deceiver
I don't like you either
You're all prejudiced for the black lung fever
Somethings keep me goin'
Well, I've got no one to blame
Five o'clock is comin', do you feel the same?
When the lonely whistle calls out your nameEmbed
