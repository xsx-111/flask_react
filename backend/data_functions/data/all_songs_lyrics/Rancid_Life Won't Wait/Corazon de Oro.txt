Corazon de Oro LyricsIt's over before it starts, oh don't you know
So on your marks, stand by; Ready, go
From London to New York, Montreal to Tokyo
I see visions of her everywhere I go
What have I become?
Now that I'm all alone

I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and
I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and
Is anybody out there got a soul?
Cause I'm just looking for a girl, the girl with a heart of gold
She overturns once again with her, oh with her champagne taste she goes
Straight down the rat hole with her total recklessness
Tomorrow will come on through, and I got nothing but a bad intention
Nothing but a silhouette girl - Met her in darkness
I say.. What have I become?
Now that I'm all alone

I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and
I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and
Is anybody out there got a soul?
Cause I'm just looking for a girl, the girl with a heart of gold
Yeah I'm in the corner I start over - I start the whole thing clean, yeah
All the pain and heartache in all my years, I was always to blame
And I dream of this girl - yeah an angelical ghost
I met dancing through my neighborhood
I'm a downtown member in a front line - Don't let me be misunderstood
Oh, I'm a downtown member in a front line - Don't let me be misunderstood
(Heart of gold!)

I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and
I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and
Is anybody out there got a soul?
Cause I'm just looking for a girl, the girl with a heart of goldEmbed
