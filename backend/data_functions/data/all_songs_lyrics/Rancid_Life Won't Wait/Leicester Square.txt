Leicester Square LyricsI got some hard times, two punks upon the subway
It's a long way to go to get to Leicester Square
A hard line, it's the one you gotta cross
The one you gotta cross to get you anywhere
Michael's on his way to payback syndication
Of fisticuffs retired and his backstreet education
The 8-ball stops him low
Then the enemy's faces show
It's crystal clear, it ain't so clear
For folks who become broken here
I got none
I got no mind for nothing
I got no insight, I got no feelings
I got nothing that you want, so stay away from here
The cocaine's out, then his world goes down, the prime objective fear
To rival forces from different times and places nowhere near
The tension begins to grow
His instincts tell him so
He jumps I jump I watch a punk and its another slaughter oh yeah
I got none
I got no mind for nothing
I got no insight, I got no feelings
I got nothing that you want, so stay away from here
I got some hard times, two punks upon the subway
It's a long way to go to get to Leicester Square
A hard line, it's the one you gotta cross
The one you gotta cross to get you anywhere
Mike gets whipped, his bull-face slapped around a cheap cigar
His gang comes in cause they're always seeing the trouble from afar
He acts so apropos
Illusions at his door
He makes his point then jumps the joint
To the backseat with that mulatto girl yeah
I got none
I got no mind for nothing
I got no insight, I got no feelings
I got nothing that you want, so stay away from here
I got some hard times, two punks upon the subway
It's a long way to go to get to Leicester Square
A hard line, it's the one you gotta cross
The one you gotta cross to get you anywhere
I got none
I got no mind for nothing
I got no insight, I got no feelings
I got nothing that you want, so stay away from here1Embed
