Lady Liberty LyricsLady Liberty, come down and bleed for me
I want nothing to do with your crazy world
Broken promises, so full of nonsense
Are blanketed by the time all abandoned and alone
From the conscious to the outside to shout it, Sandanista
Lady Liberty, come down and bleed on me
You want me to believe that the streets are paved in gold
Some tenderness, then the cold hits
And then I come to find that the streets aren't paved at all
From the conscious to the outside to shout it, Sandanista
From the conscious to the outside to shout it, Sandanista
From the Kremlin to Afghanistan to our forgotten homes
The orphans in confusion to discharged refugees
In the fields of poison ivy through the famine and disease
You bled my loyalty
Lady Liberty, come down and bleed for me
You want me to believe that the streets are paved in gold
Some tenderness, then the cold hits
And then I come to find that the streets aren't paved at all
From the conscious to the outside to shout it, Sandanista
From the conscious to the outside to shout it, Sandanista
Oh, shout it, SandanistaEmbed
