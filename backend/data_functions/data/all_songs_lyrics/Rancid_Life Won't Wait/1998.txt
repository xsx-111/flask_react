1998 LyricsWhitestone, Queens 1974
Father's talking shit, motherfucker slammed the door
Hit the streets runnin' cannot take it any more?
In the reins of the trains I cuddle on the floor
On a park bench cold, sleeping here for free
Little kids sitting in the shooting gallery
Set yourself up from innocence to misery
Oh if this is what you want
Not the way of what they fucking say
Hangin out with Sid yet again in the USA
Sidney Sidney in the USA
Lower east side 1976
Who's got the dope and who's turning tricks?
Should I call a user all for a fix?
Rippin' off some lady just to avoid from gettin' sick
But your life moves slow and you got no where to go
What the fuck happens to your soul when your low
Is he comin' over? is he comin' home?
Your mama's disappointed waiting by the phone
Yeah!!!
Hangin out with Sid yet again in the USA
Sidney Sidney in the USA
Same fuckin' shit 1998
Lifting bait, and motherfuckers that he hates
Hit some fucking people by the Kennedy strait
Who's got the bag gonna seal his fate?
On a park bench cold, sleeping here for free
Little kids sitting in the shooting gallery
Set yourself up from innocence to misery
Well this is what you want?
Not the way they fucking say
Hangin out with Sid yet again in the USA
Sidney Sidney in the USAEmbed
