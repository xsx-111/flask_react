Something in the World Today LyricsThere's something in the street tonight
Don't know what it is but it won't keep quiet
Breaking through your masses on your radio broadcaster
There's something in the air tonight
And it's turning in to a full-fledged riot
, last dance, someone tried to buy him the truth
All, all, all, all, all, nine lives
All gonna come right back for you
All, all, all, all, all, nine lives
All gonna come right back for you
There's something in the world today
I don't know what it is but it sure smells rotten
Babylon's burning and the fire seems waterproof
There's someone in your home tonight
You think you know who they are but something just ain't so right
I look at them a way but they don't feel the same about me
All, all, all, all, all, nine lives
All gonna come right back for you
All, all, all, all, all, nine lives
All gonna come right back for you
And I run and I run and I ride and I ride
And I live and I live and I die and I die
And I know it was all for you and me
And I run and I run and I ride and I ride
And I live and I live and I die and I die
And I know it was all for you and me
And I run and I run and I ride and I ride
And I live and I live and I die and I die
And I know it was all for you and me
And I run and I run and I ride and I ride
And I live and I live and I die and I die
And I know it was all for you and meEmbed
