Cocktails LyricsBroke, dough, dope, the line is choked
Smoked the last dollar to her name
Are you buying, are you selling, girl?
Talking square, never change
And if I really wanna know
What it means for her to be free
She's mixing cocktails
In a squat down Avenue C
The parasitic cling on the most  things
Don't give her a fight
Ditches come in shadows so I know
There won't be no fucking rainbow in sight
And they deny allegations so strenuously
Man, don't get outta control
She was left wrestling in her silent anger
So hell, I can't be there for her
I ain't looking for answers
I don't want nothing for free
And I sure don't want your respect
I just wanna know who's talking to me
I just wanna know who's talking to me
I know she's jacking, homegirl's macking
Trepidation, am I in love?
So she fixes them, to confuse them
That I know that 

It's unstoppable for you and me
She won't relinquish herself to you
And I sense an emergency
She can cry, she can hide in the lower east side
There's a road in the fast lane cursed
Above all the infamous
Wicked circus of the fools
And if I really wanna know
How the pernicious stay on top
They don't break, no, they don't fake
They need no wake, they don't stop
And I ain't looking for answers
I don't want nothing for free
And I sure don't want your respect
I just wanna know who's talking to me
I just wanna know who's talking to me
I just wanna know who's talking to me
I just wanna know who's talking to meEmbed
