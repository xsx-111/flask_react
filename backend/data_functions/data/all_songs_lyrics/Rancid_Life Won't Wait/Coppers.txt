Coppers LyricsLondon you gonna find them
New york, LA back to Kingston
All i see is you fightin
All i see is you fightin
Well, it's empathy the song
Integrity a callin
Humility you come to find a whole lot more
I'm not one to judge, or carry a grudge
But i refuse to budge my determinating vow
London you gonna find them
New york, LA back to Kingston
All i see is you fightin
All i see is you fightin
Easy, you know it ain't easy
Got to make a decision
Got to learn to say no, no, no
I've heard from inside of the walls
A deadman can't hear all the calls
Who lives like a sheep in the city concrete
Never runs deep and dies from the heat
Coppers and hoods
Deadman stood
It ain't no good when you're misunderstood
When you rot in a jail
Wishin you would be out on the street like robinhood
All those who fall those who try
Let them go home victimized
You ain't gonna see a power demise
Not on your life time see it hypnotized
London you gonna find them
New york, LA back to Kingston
All i see is you fightin
All i see is you fightinEmbed
