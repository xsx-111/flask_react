Warsaw Lyrics"That is the vision of the anarchist
It is also a boy's dream"
True to Warsaw politics
Beaten down with a baseball bat
Police retreated with riot shields
In fear of a baseball bat
Working class intellectuals
Disillusioned youth for sure
Broken dreams in Warsaw
With a baseball bat
American baseball bat
Demolish the discotheque
And how many blows to his forearm and neck
'Til he lay in the schoolyard, bludgeoned to death
December 13, 1981, who remembers a loaded gun?
Who remembers the first morning of martial law?
Hey, you should bring that Louisville
In the middle of nowhere
In the middle of economic hardships in Warsaw
American baseball bat
Demolish the discotheque
And how many blows to his forearm and neck
'Til he lay in the schoolyard, bludgeoned to death
Hey, all alone, bludgeoned to deathEmbed
