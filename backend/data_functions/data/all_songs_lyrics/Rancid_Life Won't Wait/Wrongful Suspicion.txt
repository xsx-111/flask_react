Wrongful Suspicion LyricsAll right, this one goes out
To all our friends in New York
H2O, The Slackers, Stubborn All-Stars
Most respect, hey Tim, take it away my man
Well, I heard they fly a confederate flag
Down at the state house
Got a gun to my head from the hand of a man
Down at the state house
Well, I'm reaching for a dollar in the hole in my pocket
Down at the state house
They said I got some rights and I really shouldn't knock it
Down at the state house
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
Broken bones, broken roles
They can all be fixed
So let them who battle with the pen
And the others with the fist
The strong ones will be defiant
With words that can't convince
You can take this as roles
But I'll take it as a diss
Well, they wanna hold me with wrongful suspicion
Down at the state house
And I'm all bundled up in an awkward position
Down at the state house
And they say it's all part of a hundred year tradition
Down at the state house
And I do feel they got a mental condition
Down at the state house
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
Hey, gettin' crazy watch me
Was it you all along working for the CIA?
Iran-Contra, Panama, American casket parlay
Visions of light, yes, visions of death, no, visions gone astray
Oh, you jump on that DC10 my man, and you fly away
Ignore the weak, ignore the poor
Down at the state house
They got a position for me on the floor, hell no
Down at the state house
They said you're gonna make a real, real nice one
Down at the state house
But they do not know the law no, not at all
Down at the state house
Was asking, what can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?
All right this one goes out
To Sick Of It All, Agnostic Front
Crown of Thornz, Dgeneration
DJ Ansen, Dave Hillyard and the Rocksteady 7
Simon and the Bar Sinisters, Nine Lives
And his new band Under The Gun, Madball
Marky Ramone and The Intruders
Hey Marky, go get your fuckin' shine box
What can we do?
What can we do?
What can we do?Embed
