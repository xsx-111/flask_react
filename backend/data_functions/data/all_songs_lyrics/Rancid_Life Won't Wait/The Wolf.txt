The Wolf LyricsI didn't trust him, 'cause he smiled at me first
Just like the wolf before he bites me
And I didn't go there I swear that it was cursed
Just as if it was to despite me
I saw some better days, from Beijing to Hunter Place
A portrait of the sum of the last couple years
See I lost an image, an image of chaos
All I've ever known is isolation and pain?
I'm on the verge of losing everything, every single day
In all this deadly drama you know I see myself fall
I've been confusing, a lost canyon, consuming it all
And I didn't trust him, 'cause he smiled at me at first
Just like the wolf before he bites me
And I didn't go there, I swear that it was cursed
Just as if it was to despite me
So I may be antisocial and shy, and yo, I found myself a job
But I journey and complain, through incredible odds
Is this simple things I guess, a delicate balance
I never really thought I could make it all happen
Now the anarchist kid gives a fuck about you
I stood up every single time that I fell
It's just you, it's just you consuming it all
And I didn't trust him, 'cause he smiled at me first
Just like the wolf before he bites me
And I didn't go there, I swear that it was cursed
Just as if it was to despite them
And I didn't trust him, 'cause he smiled at me first
Just like the wolf before he bites me
And I didn't go there, I swear that it was cursed
Just as if it was to despite me
