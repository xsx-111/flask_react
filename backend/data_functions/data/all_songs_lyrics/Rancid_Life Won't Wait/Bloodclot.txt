Bloodclot LyricsHey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!

Well I'm a crazy upsetter
(Driving me insane)
Yeah, I'm a streetwise professor
(Who am I to blame?)
Now, if you'd listen to the record
(Do you feel the same?)
Hell, it don't get any better
(Going backwards again)
Swing your fists, whack, stitches in the face
Fuck ups like me are just sorry that we're crazed
Never been like them within society
God protects me, feeling the banality

Now my guns are blazin'
Bloodclot, I can see 360
And now my guns are blazin'
Picking back up and starting all over again
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!

Well, I'm a bad motherfucker
(Driving me insane)
So don't you even bother
(Who am I to blame?)
'Cause when I listen to the record
(Do you feel the same?)
Hell, it don't get any better
(Going backwards again)
Read your words, I read your banner of hope
Well, I kick my way in, it seems to piss you all off
Well, I try to shut the gates, the walls are fading
I climb from the depths of hell unscathed

Now my guns are blazin'
Bloodclot, I can see 360
Now my guns are blazin'
Picking back up and starting all over again
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!
Hey! Go!

Now my guns are blazin'
Bloodclot, I can see 360
Now my guns are blazin'
Picking back up and starting all over again

Bloodclot
Oh, yeah
Well, I could see 360
I could see all around me
Ah, yeah
Na na na (Hey)

Na na na na (Hey)
