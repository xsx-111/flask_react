Cash, Culture and Violence LyricsYeah!
She says his power is what's happening
Well I'll be sure to be respecting nothing's stopping him
And to move up for him about crushing them
And I'll kick you plain and simple it's a sin man
Leave it to the coroner to detect this
And I'm sure the USA to wreck this
He drives a tricked out tricked out tricked out Lexus
And he looks at the city says I can take this
It's high into a corner where the one leads
Well it's so fucking high that your nose bleeds
They watch you break the nose out of respect
You broke the nose that is correct
The gates of hell are they closing in
The victim's family going condemn him
He said, "Ah don't trust them"
Yeah he'll show them
The sword, the jewel, imagination
Cash, culture and violence
Violence, wealth and knowledge
Cash, culture and violence
Oh you're riding and you're riding on the wings of destruction
Cash, culture and violence
It's the sword, the jewel, imagination
Cash, culture and violence
Poisoned like a rat who drank some strychnine gin
How many men can say they been allow this to happen
Bureaucratic military federation
Living dead only to rise again
The delicate skipped it heard the rumble
And the legions that are timid lord they crumble
And consequently nothing but a concrete jungle
And lord I wonder
The sword, the jewel, imagination
Cash, culture and violence
Violence, wealth and knowledge
Cash, culture and violence
Oh you're ridng and you're riding on the wings of destruction
Cash, culture and violence
It's the sword, the jewel, imagination
Cash, culture and violence
Nickels, diamonds, can't be found
There's no one, nothing, come straight down
Psychosomatic, come straight down
You stopped cold from your nervous breakdown
Yeah!!!
The sword, the jewel, imagination
Cash, culture and violence
Violence, wealth and knowledge
Cash, culture and violence
Oh you're ridng and you're riding on the wings of destruction
Cash, culture and violence
It's the sword, the jewel, imagination
Cash, culture and violence
(Cash!!!... Culture!!! Violence!!!)Embed
