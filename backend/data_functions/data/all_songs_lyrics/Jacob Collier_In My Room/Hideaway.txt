Hideaway Lyrics
Take me anywhere you wanna go
You know that my love is strong in my hideaway
Softly, like the calm that follows storm
Find what I've been searching for, all along in my hideaway
Even when I close my eyes
Darling, I will always stay
Wide awake in my hideaway

Touch me like I've never loved before
In a place that I adore in my hideaway
I know whichever way the wind may blow
There will be a place for me to go in my hideaway
Whether you be lost or found
Darling, if you've gone astray
I'm on my way to my hideaway

My hideaway
Down going down
Down follow down
Down going down
Down follow down
Down going down
Down follow down
Down going down
Down follow down
When the rain falls
Falling down to the sea
Flow that river
To the depth of me
When the rain falls
Falling down to the sea
Flow that river
To the depth of me
When the rain falls
Falling down to the sea
Flow that river
To the depth of me
(When the rain falls)
(When the rain falls)
(When the rain falls)
Let me feel the sky and feel the moon
Let me sing an honest tune to my hideaway
Trusting wherever I go wandering
Iâ€™ll find a home in everything in my hideaway
Maybe you can come to stay
And I will meet you here someday
Far away in my hideaway4Embed
