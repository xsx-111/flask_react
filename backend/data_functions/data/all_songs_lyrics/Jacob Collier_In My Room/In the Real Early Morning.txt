In the Real Early Morning LyricsIn the real early morning
With the sun slowly rising
I was walking out slowly
Wandering free
When out in the distance
Over the valley
I saw an old friend
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
She was a young girl
She was an old soul
As fair as the ocean
Timeless and free
She was my mother
She was my daughter
She was my lover
She was everything
An old friend could be
I said, "It's been such a long time
Since we have spoken
There's so much to say to you
I want you to know
I wish you could tell me
All that you've seen here
But we haven't got long now
For soon, you'll be fading
And soon, I must go"
I know the way home
She said "You are a soldier
You are a father
You are a wise man
You are a friend
You were my first love
I won't forget you
I'm walking beside you
I was here when you started
I'll be here till the end"
And now it's the evening
There's a moon slowly rising (ooh, ooh)
There isn't much more that
I wanted to know, wanted to know
And I am alone now
She isn't beside me no more
But I feel no sorrow
I'd come tomorrow
I'll be on my way home
I'll be on my way home3Embed
