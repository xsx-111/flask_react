In My Room Lyrics
There's a world where I can go to tell my secrets to
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room

In this world I lock out all my worries and my fears
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room

Do my dreaming and my scheming, lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing, laugh at yesterday

Now it's dark and I'm alone but I won't be afraid
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room


Do my dreaming and my scheming, lie awake and pray
I do my crying and I do my sighing, laugh at yesterday

Now it's dark and I'm alone but I won't be afraid
In my room, in my room (yeah)
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my roomEmbed
