Down The Line Lyrics
I was walking down the line
Trying to find some peace of mind
Then I saw you
You were takin' it slow, and walkin' it one step at a time

You said, "Listen, stranger
I'm feeling low now
I don't know which way to go"
I said, "If you're lost now
Maybe I could help you along and sing you a song
And move you on"

Singing down the line
Where shall we go?
Where shall we go?
Down the line
Where shall we go?

She said
"I'm looking for a kind of shelter
No place for me to call my own
I've been walking all night long, but
I don't know where to call my home"
"The only way to find that place is
Close to where my heart is
I know I'm gonna get there
But I've got to keep on walking down the line"
Down the line, yeah, say


Oh
Where shall we go?
Where shall we go?
Where shall we go?

She said
"Estoy buscando un lugar tranquilo
Un lugar que sea mío
Lo he estado buscado toda la noche
Pero no sé dónde se encuentra"
"The only way to find that place is
Close to where my heart is
Maybe I'm never gonna get there
But I've got to keep on walking down the line"
Got to keep on walking down the line
Got to keep on walking down the line

I said "You go on walking
Down the line
Wasting all your
Precious time
But you're never gonna find it
Because there is no end to the line
There's no destination for to find"
(There's no destination, baby)

"But if you get there
Don't forget me
Cause I'm the one who
Set you free
But don't come calling
'Cause I won't wanna call you a friend
So, this is end of you and me
Say, I won't wanna call you a friend
So, this is end of you and me
No, I won't wanna call you a friend
So, this is end of you and me"Embed
