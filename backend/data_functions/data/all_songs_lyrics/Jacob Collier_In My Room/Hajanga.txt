Hajanga Lyrics
Everybody, near and far
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Come together as you are
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
To the ocean, to the sky
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Sing that cosmic lullaby
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
Sing the hajanga

Sing your pleasure, sing your pain
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Like you’ll never sing again
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
Let it echo, loud and clear
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Across the ancient stratosphere
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)

Even when the sun refuse to shine
There’s a song of love that never dies
Even when the good days pass you by
Lift your voices to the sky, singin'
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
As the words go round and round
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Let the tears roll down and down
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
Sing the way you wish to be
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
And let that singing set you free
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)

Even when those dark clouds bring you down
There’s a spark of joy that can be found
Even when things break and fall apart
Lift your hands up from your heart, singin'
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Said, every morning and every night
Through the darkness to the light
Like a beacon shining bright
Sing the hajanga, you’ll be alright
From the winter comes the spring
It don’t matter what life will bring
Said, you can do most anything
So give your hajanga a song to sing
Tell your mama, tell your pa
Sing it near and sing it far
Be exactly the way you are
See the hajanga, it’s your guiding star
Every woman to every man
In every nation, every land
I said, please you’ve gotta understand
Sing the hajanga and take my hand, sing it!
Then one day your life is through
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Nothing more that you can do
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
So give away the things you know
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
And tell your friends you love them so
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
Tell 'em hajanga1Embed
