Woke Up Today Lyrics
Woke up today my mind awhirl
From head to toe with endless feeling
Tried to explain just what I see
You say to me I must be dreaming
You called my name the way
I wished you would in my imagination
Now every single thing around me
Filling me with this sensation
In my searching around
I've seen so many faces
Now I've found the one I needed
And the sun is rising

I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
Found my strength to feel it
I woke up today
Heaven knows it
Found a girl who makes me see
Ahhh
Spoke up today about the things in my life
I didn't think I needed
They flew outside my window pane now
Pain is not to be kept a secret
These walls are built for no resemblance
To the things I treasured dearly
And now the thoughts just clear the way
Oh baby I see you don't need me
In this crazy old world
I've been so many places
Seen how we're all gonna need some shelter
When the sun is sinking

I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
Found my strength to feel it
I woke up today
Heaven knows it
Found a girl who makes me see

I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
Found my, found my strength to feel it
I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
Found my, found my strength to feel it
I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
Found my, found my strength to feel it
I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
(Just like I wanted to)
Found my strength to feel it2Embed
