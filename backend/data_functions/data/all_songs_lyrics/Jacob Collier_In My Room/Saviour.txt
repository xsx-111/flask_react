Saviour Lyrics
Saviour
Hah hah ah yeah
Saviour

You say that I'm lost and you can help me find
But I don't want to be a saviour, no
I wish that you could tell me something to change my mind
But you don't want to be my saviour (no)

She wants to feel me (feel me)
She wants to find a way to heal me (heal me)
But I bet she'll never find the real me, hah hah oh yeah
She said she really wants to get to know me (know me)
And that she thinks that I can make her feel less lonely (lonely)
She said she's got so much to show me, hah hah oh yeah yeah

I've been up and I've been down
Watching life go 'round and 'round
(But I know) No matter what you try to do
(I know) I'll never be the one for you
(I know) It doesn't matter what you're going through
I'm gonna keep on singing
You say that I'm lost and you can help me find
But I don't want to be a saviour, no
I wish that you could tell me something to change my mind
But you don't want to be my saviour (no)

I don't need you saving me
I don't need you saving me

She wants to touch me (touch me)
Deep down below and up above me (above me)
Yeah, I know, but she's never gonna love me, hah hah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
I know she's always gonna try and please me (please me)
That she could never find the strength to leave me (leave me)
You'll never be the one to free me, hah hah oh yeah yeah

I've been up and I've been down
Watching life go 'round and 'round
(But I know) I'm not the person you've been searching for
(I know) So go and knock on someone else's door
(I know) 'Cause I don't want to listen anymore
I'm gonna keep on singing
You say that I'm lost and you can help me find
But I don't want to be a saviour, no
I wish that you could tell me something to change my mind
But you don't want to be my saviour (no)

I don't need you saving me
I don't need you saving me

I don't wanna be a leader, I just wanna be a friend
If I let your mind create me, ha! the work will never end
I don't wanna be a preacher, I just wanna be a man
I won't let you exaltate me, just keep me as I am

You don't wanna be my saviour, you don't wanna close that door
I don't wanna hear your reasons, would you tell me what we're searching for?
You don't wanna be my saviour, you don't wanna close that door
I don't wanna hear your reasons, just tell me what we're searching for

Searching for the road to make our dreams come true
Searching for the prayer that she will love me true1Embed
