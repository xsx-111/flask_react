Flintstones Lyrics
Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
They're a modern stone age family
(Stone age family)
From the town of Bedrock
They're a page right out of history
Let's ride with the family down the street
Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet
When you're with the Flintstones
Have a yabba dabba doo old time
Flintstones. Meet the Flintstones
They're a modern stone age family
From the town of Bedrock
They're a page right out of history
Let's ride with the family down the street
Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet
When you're with the Flintstones
Have a yabba yabba doo time
Have a yabba doo time
We're gonna have a gay old time
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah...

Now it's time to meet the Flinstones

Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
They're a modern stone age family
From the town of Bedrock
They're a page right out of history
Someday, maybe Fred will win the fight
And that cat will stay out for the night
When you're with the Flintstones
Have a yabba yabba doo time
We'll have a gay old timeEmbed
