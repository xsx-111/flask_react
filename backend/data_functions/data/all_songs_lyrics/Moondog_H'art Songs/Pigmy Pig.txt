All you Herbivorians, reapers to adore
If the only food were meat, you would eat no more
All you Carnivorians, butchers to adore
If the only food were plant, you would eat no more
All you Omnivorians, waging total war
If the only food were none, you would eat no more
All the Pigmy Edibles wish you Pigmies well:
"Eat your way to Heaven, or eat your way to Hell!"1Embed
