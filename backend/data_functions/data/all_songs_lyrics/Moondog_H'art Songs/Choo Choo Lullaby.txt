Choo Choo Lullaby LyricsChoo-Choo Lullaby, sing oh me oh my;
Rock a baby by, Choo-Choo
Rock a baby low, rock a baby slow
To Promontory Point we go!
Choo-Choo have you heard? Mind you, not a word
Their´s to be a back-tracking
Back to coal and steam! Isn´t that a scream?
I heard it from a miner bird
Carter wants her back, back to Hackensack
Carter, out in Wyoming
Carter wants her back, back to blow her stack
So Choo-Choo, see what you can do
Give her back her track, give her back her stack
Taller than a tale, Choo-Choo
Give her back her crew, give her back her due
Along the California trail!
Give a boot a sail; give a kite a tail;
Give drought a rain, Choo-Choo
Give your dear Ol´Dad what he never had
An Honest Engine Choo-Choo Train
What a "Union Day" is the Tenth of may
Just for you and me, Choo-Choo
Past and present meet, underneath our feet
A promontory point of view!
Union... Union...
Union Pacific...Embed
