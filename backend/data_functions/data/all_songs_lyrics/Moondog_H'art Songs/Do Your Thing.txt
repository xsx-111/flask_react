Do Your Thing LyricsDo your thing!
Be fancy-free to call the tune you sing
Don't give up!
That's not the way to win a loving-cup
Do your best
And Opportunity will do the rest
Don't give in!
Capitulation is the greatest sin
Do what's right
What's right for you, to do with all your might
Don't regret!
What might have been, you might as well forget
Stand your ground
And while you're standing there, be duty-bound
Learn to wait
And while you're waiting, learn to concentrate
Make amends!
All enemies I call potential friends
Calm your fears
And hope to cope at least a hundred years
Make your mark!
If need be, even make it in the dark
Mum's the word!
My sage advice, pretend you haven't heard2Embed
