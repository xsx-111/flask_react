The Butterfly Collector Lyrics
So you finally got what you wanted
You've achieved your aim
By making the walking lame
And when you just can't get any higher
You use your senses
To suss out this week's climber
And the small fame that you've acquired
Has brought you into cult status
But to me you're still a collector

There's tarts and whores
But you're much more
You're a different kind
Cause you want their minds
And you just don't care
Cause you've got no pride
It's just a face on your pillowcase
That thrills you

And you started looking much older
And your fashion sense
Is second-rate like your perfume
But to you in your little dream world
You're still the queen
Of the butterfly collectors
As you carry on
Cause it's all you know
You can't light a fire
You can't cook or sew
You get from day to day
By filling your head
But surely you must know
The appeal between your legs
Has worn off

And I don't care about morals
Cause the world's insane
And we're all to blame anyway
And I don't feel any sorrow
Towards the kings and queens
Of the butterfly collectors

There's tarts and whores
But you're much more
You're a different kind
Cause you want their minds
And you just don't care
Cause you've got no pride
It's just a face on your pillowcase
That thrills you
As you carry on
Cause it's all you know
You can't light a fire
You can't cook or sew
You get from day to day
By filling your head
But surely you must know
The appeal between your legs
Has worn off

And I don't feel any sorrow
Towards the kings and queens
Of the butterfly collectorsEmbed
