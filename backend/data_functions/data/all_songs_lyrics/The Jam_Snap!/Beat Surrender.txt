Beat Surrender LyricsBeat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
All the things that I care about
(Are packed into one punch)
All the things that I'm not sure about
(Are sorted out at once)
And as it was in the beginning
So shall it be in the end
That bullshit is bullshit
It just goes by different names
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
All the things that I shout about
(But never act upon)
All the courage and the dreams I have
(But seem to wait so long)
My doubt is cast aside
Watch phonies run to hide
The dignified don't even enter in the game
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
And if you feel there's no passion
No quality sensation
Seize the young determination
Show the fakers you ain't foolin'
You'll see me come runnin'
To the sound of your strummin'
Fill my heart with joy and gladness
I've lived too long in the shadows of sadness
My doubt is cast aside
Watch phonies run to hide
The dignified don't even enter in the game
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Wake me up with your amphetamine blast
Take me by the collar, throw me out into the world
Rock me gently and send me dreaming of something tender
I was brought here to pay homage
