Mr. Clean LyricsDaylight dawns, you wake up and yawn, Mr. Clean
A piece of toast from the one you love most, and you leave
You catch your bus in the 8 o'clock rush
And catch your train in the morning rain
Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean
If you see me in the street, look away
'Cause I don't ever want to catch you looking at me, Mr. Clean
'Cause I hate you and your wife
And if I get the chance I'll fuck up your life
Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean
Is that seen?
Surround yourself with dreams
Of pretty young girls, and anyone you want, but
Please don't forget me or any of my kind
'Cause I'll make you think again
When I stick your face in the grind
Getting pissed at the annual office do
Smart blue suit and you went to Cambridge too
You miss page 3, but The Times is right for you
And mum and dad are very proud of you
Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean
Mr. Clean, Mr. CleanEmbed
