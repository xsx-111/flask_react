The Modern World Lyrics
This is a modern world
This is the modern world

What kind of fool do you think I am?
You think I know nothing of the modern world
All my life has been the same
I've learned to live by hate and pain
It's my inspiration drive

I've learned more than you'll ever know
Even at school I felt quite sure
That one day I would be on top
And I'd look down upon the map
The teachers who said I'd be nothing
Hey!

This is the modern world that I've learned about
This is the modern world
We don't need no one to tell us what's right or wrong
This is the modern world!

Say what you like 'cause I don't care
I know where I am and going to
It's somewhere I won't preview
Don't have to explain myself to you
I don't give two fucks about your review
This is the modern world that I've learned about
This is the modern world
We don't need no one to tell us what's right or wrong
Modern world, this is, this is, this is, this is
This is, this is, this is
Hey, we don't need no one to tell us what's right or wrong

Ah...
This is a modern world
This is the modern worldEmbed
