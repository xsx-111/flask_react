Thick as Thieves LyricsTimes were so tough, but not as tough as they are now
We were so close and nothing came between us and the world
No personal situations
Thick as thieves us, we'd stick together for all time
And we meant it but it turns out just for a while
We stole the friendship that bound us together
We stole from the schools and their libraries
We stole from the drugs that sent us to sleep
We stole from the drink that made us sick
We stole anything that we couldn't keep
And it was enough, we didn't have to spoil anything
And always be as thick as thieves
Like a perfect stranger, you came into my life
Then like the perfect lone ranger
You rode away, rode away, rode away, rode away
We stole the love from young girls in ivory towers
We stole autumn leaves and summer showers
We stole the silent wind that says you are free
We stole everything that we could see
But it wasn't enough - and now we've gone and spoiled everything
Now we're no longer as thick as thieves
You came into my life
Then like a perfect stranger
You walked away, walked away, walked away, walked away
Thick as thieves us, we'd stick together for all time
And we meant it but it turns out just for a while
We stole the friendship that bound us together
We stole the burning sun in the open sky
We stole the twinkling stars in the black night
We stole the green belt fields that made us believe
We stole everything that we could see
But something came along that changed our minds
I don't know what and I don't know why
But we seemed to grow up in a flash of time
While we watched our ideals helplessly unwind
No, we're no longer as thick as thieves - no
We're not as thick as we used to be, no
We're no longer as thick as thieves, no
We're not as thick as we used to be
No it wasn't enough
And we've gone and spoiled everything
Now we're no longer as thick as thievesEmbed
