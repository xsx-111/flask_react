David Watts Lyrics
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
I am a dull and simple lad
Cannot tell water from champagne
And I have never met the Queen
And I wish I could have all he has got, oy

Wish I could be like David Watts
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And when I lie on my pillow at night
I dream I could fight like David Watts
And lead the school team to victory
Take my exams, and pass the lot
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be)  like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
He is the head boy at the school
He is the captain of the team
He is so gay and fancy free
And I wish I could have all he has got, oy

Wish I could be like David Watts
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And all the girls in the neighborhood
Try to go out with David Watts
They try their best, but can't succeed
For he is of pure and noble breed
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts

Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa (David Watts)
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa (David Watts)
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa (David Watts)
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa (David Watts)
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa (David Watts)
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa (David Watts)
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa (David Watts)
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa (David Watts)1Embed
