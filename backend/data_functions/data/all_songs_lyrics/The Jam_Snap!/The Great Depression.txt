The Great Depression LyricsI think we must have all gone mad
We're being right turned over
They promised us the Earth
Instead we've got the great depression
Now you're free and easy with the fates
You blame your brothers and sisters
I'm alright Jack so sod the rest
Is the new dissension

Into the abyss
Backwards and forwards
It's always down
It's a desperate war
You're trying to pry yourself up
You don't care who you stab
Or stoop to help them out
Hey hey hey
Well that's not the way
Hey hey hey
Well that's not the way
Hey hey hey hey
No sense or reason in your fussing and fighting
And your violent obsession
Who's ever really left feeling fine
After the great depression?
No sense of purpose in the competition
Keeping up with the Jones's
You buy a house, you buy a car
You buy a marriage and a bed of roses

No sense or reason in your fussing and fighting
And your violent obsession
Who's ever really left feeling fine
After the great depression?
Hey hey hey
Well that's not that wayEmbed
