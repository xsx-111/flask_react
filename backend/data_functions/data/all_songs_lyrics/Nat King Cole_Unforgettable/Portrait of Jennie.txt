Portrait of Jennie Lyrics
A portrait of Jennie, more precious to me
Than a masterpiece however famous it be
The portrait of Jennie is etched on my heart
Where her features have been sketched from the start

Ah, the color and beauty of life
And the glow of her spirit divine
All cast in heaven's own design

With a portrait of Jennie, I never will part
For there isn't any portrait of Jennie
Except in my heart


For there isn't any portrait of Jennie
Except in my heartEmbed
