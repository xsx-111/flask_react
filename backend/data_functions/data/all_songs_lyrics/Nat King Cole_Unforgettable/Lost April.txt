Lost April Lyrics
Lost April
Where did you go?
Like winter's snow
I saw you vanish
Lost April
So soft and warm
A memory
Not even time can banish
Lost April
That taught me this
A single kiss
Could lead to heaven
But April had numbered days
So when they passed
Love couldn't last
I lost love and you
And April, too


So when they passed
Love couldn't last
I lost love and you
And April, tooEmbed
