Make Her Mine Lyrics
Make the river deep, the mountain high
The cornflower blue as the summer sky
And heaven above me, tell her to love me
Make her mine
Make the valley green, the pine tree tall
The warmth of the sun after raindrops fall
And heaven above me, tell her to love me
Make her mine

Is it so wrong to long for
Someone who's so supreme?
I'm not the one she's strong for
But is a sin if I dream?

I sigh for her and her caress
Am I but a voice in the wilderness?
Oh, heaven above me, tell her to love me
Make her mine

Is it so wrong to long for
Someone who's so supreme?
I'm not the one she's strong for
But is a sin if I dream?
I sigh for her and her caress
Am I but a voice in the wilderness?
Oh, heaven above me, tell her to love me
Make her mineEmbed
