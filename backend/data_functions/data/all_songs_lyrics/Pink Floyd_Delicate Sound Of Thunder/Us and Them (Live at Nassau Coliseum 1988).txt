Us and Them (Live at Nassau Coliseum 1988) Lyrics
Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
"Forward" he cried from the rear and the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round
"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried
"Listen son", said the man with the gun
"There's room for you inside"

I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock, they won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he get off lightly
Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?
Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man diedEmbed
