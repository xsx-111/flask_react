Too Many Happy Faces LyricsToo many happy faces, I wonder what that means
Are you personally offended by an iron on your jeans
Too many happy faces, is that more than you can bear
Or is it part of what you should be, lack of hygiene in your hair
Oohooh, oohooh
Oohooh, ooh
If I thought you were clever, I'd be even more upset
And if you knew what you were saying, I might even have respect
As a Christian I should love you
But I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
See your know-it-all face on TV
And I couldn't care less about what you want to say
And I wish that it wasn't just me
Oh I don't think I'm better or kinder of heart, I'm as guilty as I can be
But every chance I get to put a smile on someone's face I will take it
Believe me
But I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
See your know-it-all face on TV
And I couldn't care less about what you want to say
And I wish that it wasn't just me
No I wish that it wasn't just me
Too many happy faces
How eloquent you are
You know someday I think you'll
Become a big, big superstar
But I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
See your know-it-all face on TV
And I couldn't care less about what you want to say
And I wish that it wasn't just me
No, I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
See your know-it-all face on TV
And I couldn't care less about what you want to say
And I wish that it wasn't just me
No, I wish that it wasn't just me
No, I wish that it wasn't just meEmbed
