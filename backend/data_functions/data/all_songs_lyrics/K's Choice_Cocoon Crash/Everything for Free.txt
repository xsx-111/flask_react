Everything for Free LyricsI don't know who you are
But you seem very nice
So will you talk to me
Shall I tell you a story
Shall I tell you a dream
They think I'm crazy
But they don't know that I like it here
It's nice in here, I get everything for free
Have you been here before
Shall I show you around
It's very pretty
Have you come here to stay
Well, you sure picked a day
My name is Billy
It's my birthday, you're invited to my party down the hall
Where I go, what I'll become or who I am or what I'll be
I'll never know, but I am sure that I'll get everything for free
I'm not troubled or sad
I'm just ready for bed
It's been a long day
Before they switch off the lights
It truly was a delight
They think I'm crazy
But they don't know that I like it here
It's nice in here
Where I go, what I'll become or who I am or what I'll be
I'll never know, but I am sure that I'll get everything for free
Where I go, what I'll become or who I am or what I'll be
I'll never know, but I am sure that I'll get everything for free
Everything for free
I don't know who you are
But you seem very nice
So will you talk to me
Have you been here before
Well, you sure picked a day
They think I'm crazy...Embed
