Cocoon Crash LyricsEvery single night in bed a black cross says
"Perhaps you're getting better"
I'd like to thank you for your efforts to promote what really matters
Whenever you're about to fall, remember this, it's not a news flash
Don't pretend to know it all, but go ahead, call it a cocoon crash
What I really see in you, is nothing like the things you do
As you are doing them right now
What you would really love to win
To become the air as well as trash
Is to get rid of all your skin
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash
Call it what you will, call it what you will
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash
Suddenly the ego that I used to have is no bigger than an eyelash
Clearly I remember someone told me "Hold on tight, here's your cocoon crash"
What I really see in you, is nothing like the things you do
As you are doing them right now
What you would really love to win
To become the air as well as trash
Is to get rid of all your skin
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash
Call it what you will, call it what you will
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash
Call it what you will, call it what you will, yeah you will
Call it what you will, yeah you willEmbed
