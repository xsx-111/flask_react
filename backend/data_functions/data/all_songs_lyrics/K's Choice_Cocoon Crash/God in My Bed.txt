God in My Bed LyricsBefore last night my heart was grey
Like my country is today
Big kaleidoscope I see
A thousand people gaze at me
To break the ice I start to sing
About a cell called everything
A cell so big a word like small
Is suitable to say it all
Is the fighting over, I lost track
Like a wave it all comes back
Same kaleidoscope I see
Someone standing next to me
It's hard to do, it's hard to try
Hard to stop wondering why
Do I keep filing every case
When the answer's on your face
You can't see her but you do
Music is transparent too
So join me, sing with all your might
Hallelujah, praise tonight
Far away and long ago
Wintertime meant feeling low
Now every single star looks bright
God was in my bed last nightEmbed
