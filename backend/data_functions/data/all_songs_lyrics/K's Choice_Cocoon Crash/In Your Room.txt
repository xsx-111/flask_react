In Your Room LyricsAs she falls down and hurts her head
She's lying still but she's not dead
Awakens slowly, sees a picture of herself
On the wall as she gets up
Straightens her dress and calls me up
She says: 'I know now, I am whole now. Can you come?'
In your room where both of you are talking
Your good side and your bad
Discussing who has better hair
In your space, I hear four feet walking
And there are two more knocking
In case you're wondering
I'm still on your side
As she embraces all of me
I want her only to need me
It doesn't matter what I tell her because she changes
Her mind before she speaks
And tends to talk before she thinks
But how I love her
I know there's truth for you somewhere
If I were wise I'd take you there
But I'm not, at least not yet
So I'll be watching you instead
In your room, in your room
In your room, I can wander around forever
And I recognize the color of the walls that we painted
In your chair that I broke because I was careless
I can sit and watch you dance around
My words are spoken, I am on your side
My words are spoken, I am on your side
In your room, in your roomEmbed
