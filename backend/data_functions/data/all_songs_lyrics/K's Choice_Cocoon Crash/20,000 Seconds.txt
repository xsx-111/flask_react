20,000 Seconds Lyrics20,000 seconds since you've left and I'm still counting
And 20,000 reasons to get up
Get something done, but I'm still waiting
Is someone kind enough to pick me up and give me food
Assure me that the world is good
But you should be here, you should be here
How colors can change and even the texture of the rain
And what's that ugly little stain on the bathroom floor
I'd rather not deal with that right now
I'd rather be floating in space somewhere or
Worry about the ozone layer
And it's almost like a corny movie scene
But I'm out of frame and the lighting's bad
And the music has no theme
And we're all so strong when nothing's wrong
And the world is at our feet
But how small we are when our love is far away
And all you need is youEmbed
