Believe LyricsBravely I look further than I see
Knowing things I know I cannot be, not now
I'm so aware of where I am, but I don't know where that is
And there's something right in front of me and I...
Touch the fingers of my hand
And I wonder if it's me
Holding on and on to Theories of prosperity
Someone who can promise me
I believe in me
Tomorrow I was nothing, yesterday I'll be
Time has fooled me into thinking it's a part of me
Nothing in this room but empty space
No me, no world, no mind, no face
Touch the fingers of my hand and tell me if it's me
Holding on and on to Love, what else is real
A religion that appeals to me, oh
I believe in me
Can you turn me off for just a second, please
Turn me into something faceless
Weightless, mindless, homeless Vacuum state of peace
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
I believe in me
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
I believe in me
Wait for me I'm nothing on my own
I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now
I'm so aware of everything, but nothing seems for real
As long as you're in front of me then I'll
Watch the fingers of my hands
And I'm grateful that it's me
Holding On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
I believe in me
I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now
I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now (I believe in me)
I'm so aware of everything, I'm still aware of where I am...Embed
