On the Beach LyricsThe Autumn leaves were falling
Hearing nature talking
I thought I heard her calling
Hush now, don't you cry
A figure in the sky
Can't stop myself from shaking
My mind at last is waking
Eight minds embracing
A figure in the sky
A figure in the sky
A figure in the sky
A figure in the sky
Hadn't time to analyse
What I saw before my eyes
But nothing would surprise me
Here on our beach
Far away from you all
Far away from you all
I thought I heard her calling
Thought I heard her calling
Unsure of what we're facing
The precious time we're wasting
I'll always be embracing
Figures in the sky
A figure in the sky, no
A figure in the sky
A figure in the sky
A figure in the sky
A figure in the sky
A figure in the skyEmbed
