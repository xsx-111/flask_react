Looking Inwardly LyricsI delve into myself
Ceaselessly
Oh, but I rarely see
What I want to see
Embracing the future
Forgetting the past
Loves, loss and misfortune
The chaos and the crass
Crass
I'm wary of you
Oh, but you're oblivious to me
I'm chained to your ego
Oh, but there isn't a key
I play with emotions
Oh, but never my own
Don't you recognise me?
Try looking inwardly
Ah, but you won't see me
Such a strange fascination
As I wallow in waste
That such a trivial victory
Can put a smile on your face
Using me as the scapegoat
For what you want to believe
So I'll just bow out politely
And tip my cap as I leave
Ah, comme ci, comme ca, comme ci
My eyes are wide open, yours are closed
It's time you realised I'm a part of you
Look inwardly
Don't bleed for me
Look inwardly
Don't bleed for me
Look to yourself
Look inwardly
Look to yourself
Look inwardly
Don't bleed for me
Look to yourself
Look inwardly
Don't bleed for me
Look to yourself
Look inwardly
Don't bleed for me
Look to yourself
Look to yourselfEmbed
