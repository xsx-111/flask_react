Intrigue in Tangiers LyricsWhen it's summer and the skies are glass
When it's summer and the skies are glass
I just have to make the evenings last
They're always flying past
Oh, when it's raining and the skies are black
When it's raining and the skies are black
I just have to hear the thunder roll
And see the lightning crack
With fading powers we sit for hours
By a television screen
With forty cigarettes and talk for hours
Of the places that we've seen
Oh, brother, can you hear my voice?
Brother, can you hear my voice?
Every second that you cling to life
You have to feel alive
Well, it's an easy thing to sell your skin
It's an easy thing to sell your skin
With the devil banging on the door
You always let him in
With fading powers we dream of hours
That will never come again
Old defenders are themselves defenseless
When the mad attack the sane
What can you do when you see no future
In front of you?
Food for the few, so many it seems
Stand in front of you
I see my face reflected there
In the sweating brow
You hate what you see, what can be done
When there's no way out?
No way out, no
Brother, can you hear my voice?
Brother, can you hear my voice?
Every second that you cling to life
You have to feel alive
And now it's summer and the skies are glass
When it's summer and the skies are glass
I just have to make the evenings last
They're always flashing past
So, there we cower, we sit for hours
By a television screen
With forty cigarettes and talk for hours
Of the places that we've seen
But when you sleep, but when you sleep
Where do you go? Where do you go?
But when you sleep, but when you sleep
Where do you go? Where do you go?
But when you sleep, but when you sleep
Where do you go? Where do you go?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know2Embed
