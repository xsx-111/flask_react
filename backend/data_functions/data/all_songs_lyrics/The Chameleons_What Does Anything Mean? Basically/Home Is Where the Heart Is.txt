Home Is Where the Heart Is LyricsSo here we are waking
Savages shaking
The road that we're taking
We walked before
And if these times
Should seal our fate
You won't see me
At Heavens gate
Danger is lurking
Evil is working
Yet here we are hiding
Behind our doors
Come out, come out
It's time to grow
Enjoy the ride
One more time before you go
According to Hoyle, all cards on the table
What else can you do when life is unstable?
The night's growing colder
The enemy bolder
But as you grow older
No, you cease to care
But if we run
Or try to hide
And turn our face
We'll have no hopes to keep alive
According to Hoyle, all cards on the table
Reactions cool, the world unstable
According to Hoyle, all cards on the table
What can you do when life is unstable?
So here we are waking
Savages shaking
Yet here we are hiding
Danger is lurkingEmbed
