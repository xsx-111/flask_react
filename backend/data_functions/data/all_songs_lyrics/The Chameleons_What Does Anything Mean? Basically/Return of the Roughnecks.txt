Return of the Roughnecks LyricsUp and down, these days are up and down
They call it elevated living
A faster future for a faster breed
Unforgiving, unfulfilling
The spirit's willing but the mind is weak
I had an empty education
I want to speak but when I try to speak
It doesn't help the situation
And some, they fly while others fall
And some, they walk while others crawl
It stops them feeling small, that's all
Shake your hand, they'll always shake your hand
Without a moment's hesitation
Burning bridges and the snapping strands
That support a generation
You want to climb but when you try to climb
You see the ladder getting shorter
You want to drink but when you try to drink
There's someone pissing in the water
The soul is something they can buy
"So softly, softly step inside"
Says the spider to the fly, nice try
And every day you're crucified
If you can't look them in the eye
Smile and wave goodbye, nice try
Nice try
Vices embraced in times of crisis
Sweet vices embraced in times of crises
That's all
That's all
That's allEmbed
