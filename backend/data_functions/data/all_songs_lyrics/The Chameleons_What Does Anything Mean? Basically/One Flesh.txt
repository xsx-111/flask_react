One Flesh LyricsWith the sun in your eyes it's easy mistaking
The truth from the lies in the love that you're making
Don't pretend it isn't so
With the sun in your eyes it always reveals
A voluntary bondage that always appeals
It's how you make the garden grow
But why this weakness? No one knows
Our conscience cries his sorrow while we sleep
But once the morning's dawned
Out the back door silently he creeps
Oh, with the sun in your eyes, always reminding
A sense of excitement you've no hope of finding
With the chains that bind your feet
Belonging or longing, for a few empty hours
In a stranger's bed to chase away
A fear that's in your head
But why this weakness? No one knows
The vacant, faceless voices on the phone
Bring words that offer no
Consolation when you're all alone
With the sun in your eyes
The sun in your eyes
So cover your ears and shade your eyes
Thoughts conceived between the thighs
Beaten on the brow of history
A union forged in slavery
In all that's hope and decency
Hope for you and hope for me
For every woman, child or man
Those who'll chain you if they can
The babe you're bouncing on your knee
Needs your help now, can't you see?
The babe you're bouncing on your knee
Needs your help now, can't you see?1Embed
