View from a Hill Lyrics
Feel myself falling to the ground
Solitary silence, there's no sound
Open my eyes and look around
Colours and concepts that confound
All around

You wait till your time comes round again

Pick myself up and take the air
The fragrance of children everywhere
Slowly absorbed into my square
Debating what is and isn't there
Who cares

Just wait until your turn comes round
Again
