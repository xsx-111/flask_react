Pleasure and Pain Lyrics
White as a cotton cloud
Silence, sea and sky
Innocent as the child
Always asking why

I can take you there, I can show you
I can take you there, I'll be there
Oh, gently catching you as you fall
Hearing you when you call
Smiling as we climb
Oh, smiling crocodilic

Certainly as the sun
Bakes a Sahara day
Ancient as the hills
Crumbling into clay

I can take you there, I can show you
I can take you there, I'll be there
Oh, gently catching you as you fall
Hearing you when you call
Smiling as we climb
Smiling as we climb
There's pleasure and pain
No loss, no gain
Pleasure and pain
Again and again
Pleasure and pain

I can take you there, I can show you
I can take you there, I'll be there...
As you fall

This madness, this laughter
Outward feelings I can't control
This madness, this laughter
Outward feelings I can't control
Those coloured lights are leading me
Is it you, is it me?
Oh, is it you, is it me?Embed
