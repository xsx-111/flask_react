Second Skin Lyrics
One cold damp evening
The world stood still
I watched as I held my breath
A silhouette I thought I knew
Came through, someone spoke to me
Whispered in my ear
This fantasy's for you
Fantasies are in this year

My whole life flashed, before my eyes
I thought, what they say is true
I've shed my skin
And my disguise
And cold and naked I
Emerged from my cocoon
And a half-remembered tune
Played softly in my head, he said

He turns smiling
And he said:

I realise a miracle is due
I dedicate this melody to you
I realise a miracle is due
I dedicate this melody to you
But is this the stuff dreams are made of?
If this is the stuff dreams are made of
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
I realise a miracle is due
I dedicate this melody to you
But is this the stuff dreams are made of?
If this is the stuff dreams are made of
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on...
Air
Everywhere
Oh, it feels like I'm everywhere

Like when you fail to make the connection
You know how vital it is
Oh, when something slips through your fingers
You know how precious it is
Oh, when you reach the point when you know
It's only your second skin
It's only your second skin
(Something's banging on my door)
Like when you fail to make the connection
You know how vital it is (Someone's banging on my door)
Oh, when something slips through your fingers
You know how precious it is (Something's banging on my door)
Oh, when you reach the point when you know
It's only your second skin (Someone's banging on my door)
(Something's banging on my door)
(Someone's banging on my door)3Embed
