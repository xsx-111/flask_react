Here Today LyricsDon't know what happened but somebody lost their mind tonight
Not sure what happened but I don't think I got home tonight
There's blood on my shirt
A clap of thunder and I see my life go flashing by
The smell of sulfur and I weep as I embrace the sky
And somebody screamed
My chest is burning, I think someone set my soul alight
Don't know what happened but I don't think I got home tonight
I wonder why
I wonder why
Ah, there's madness here today
Ah, I think I'll go away
Where is my wife?
Where is my wife?
I'm draining away
I'm draining away
(Draining away)
