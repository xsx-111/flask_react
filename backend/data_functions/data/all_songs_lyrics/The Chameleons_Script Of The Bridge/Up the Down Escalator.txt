Up the Down Escalator Lyrics
I'm gazing at faces staring blankly at me
Oh, I suppose it's just a sign of the times
They tell me tomorrow will never arrive
But I've seen it end a million times
I lost my direction while dodging the flack
Oh, give me a hint or something
If I could freeze time at the flick of the switch
I wouldn't hesitate, no

There must be something wrong, boys
Yeah, there must be something wrong, boys

Obnoxious actions, obnoxious results
Yes, teachers who refuse to be taught
Distorted pictures and dizzy, dizzy people
Rush by me at the speed of thought
They sit at the tables and throw us the scraps
For Christ's sake leave me something
Now they can erase you at the flick of a switch
Oh, there must be a way

Oh, there must be something wrong, boys
Yeah, there must be something wrong, boys
There must be something wrong, boys
They're dragging me down
Eden, there's no Eden
Anyway

They sit at the tables and throw us the scraps
For Christ's sake, leave us something
Now they can erase you at the flick of a switch
How long will it take

Oh, there must be something wrong, boys
Yeah, there must be something wrong, boys
There must be something wrong, boys
And they're dragging me down

...and they're dragging me down
And they're dragging me down
You either swim or you drown1Embed
