Monkeyland Lyrics
I shake my head and shiver
They smile and they stab my back as they shake my hand
Send out an SOS plea
Come quickly, I'm marooned in Monkeyland

Is there anyone there
Who understands me?
Anyone at all?

I'm idly staring at the sky
Did anybody hear me sigh?
A million stars are a moving sight
To all you out there hearing me tonight

It's just a trick of the light
Yeah, it's just a trick of the light
I have to know what is real
And what is illusion
Oh, how does it feel
Beyond this confusion?

Is there anyone there?
Do I dismiss this with a sigh?
Oh yes, you must from time to time
And let the answers pass me by
More questions set to bend the mind
Is my creator a God or a man?
Yes, yours too
Does someone somewhere care and
Understand?

It's just a trick of the light
Yeah, it's just a trick of the light
I have to know what is real
And what is illusion
Tell me how does it feel
Beyond this confusion?
For all the tricks of the light
Yeah, for all the tricks of the light out there tonight, tonight
I have to know what is real
And what is illusion
Oh, how does it feel
Beyond this confusion?

Is there anyone there?
Oh, is there anyone there?
Life's an optical illusion
Like other optical illusions
Oh, beware
Oh, beware
There it goes again1Embed
