As High As You Can Go Lyrics
Out of tune boys, out of tune boys
Signposts to the sun
Single file boys, single file boys
Signposts to the sun
High as you can go, Lennon to Monroe
Clawed their way to the stars
High as you can go, Lennon to Monroe
Clawed their way to the stars
I think they knew

And I don't care who you are
Oh, sign the line and away you fly

Unexpectedly rejected
Safety for the few
Same excuses resurrected
None of them are true
High as you can go, Grace Kelly to Garbo
Clawed their way to the stars
High as you can go, Grace Kelly to Garbo
Clawed their way to the stars
I think they knew
No, I don't care who you are
Just sign the line and away you fly

Take a chance and join the dance
And you can make the sound
Take a chance and join the dance
And you can go to ground
Take a chance and join the dance
And you can make the sound
Take a chance and join the dance
And you can go to ground
Oh, go to ground

And I don't care who you are
Oh, turn around and away you fly
And away you fly
And I don't care who you are
No, I don't care who you areEmbed
