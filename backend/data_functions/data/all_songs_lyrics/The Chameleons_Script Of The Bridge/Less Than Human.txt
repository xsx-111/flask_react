Less Than Human Lyrics
Must have died a thousand times
I must have died a thousand times
I must have died a thousand times
Feeling less than human, I surmise
That I'm less than human in God's eyes

Time, he's on my side, she said
Time, he's on my side, she said
He may be on your side, I said
But it makes no difference in the end
He's coming after you, my friend

I must have cried a thousand times
Must have cried a thousand times
I must have cried a thousand times
Feeling less than human, I surmise
I'm less than human in God's eyes

I must have died a thousand times
I must have died a thousand times
And I must have cried a thousand times
I must have cried a thousand times
