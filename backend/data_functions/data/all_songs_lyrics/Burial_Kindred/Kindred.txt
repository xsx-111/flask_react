Kindred LyricsI can't save you
I feel alive
With you
Oh, and maybe you feel it too
I find the light
With you
Oh, and maybe you find it too
And I feel
Maybe you can find the light
Maybe you can find the light
And I feel
Maybe you feel
Maybe you feel it too
Maybe you can find the light
Maybe you can find the light
Maybe you can find the light
With you
Oh, and maybe you feel it too
I find the light with you
Oh, and maybe you find it too
And I feel
Maybe you can find the light
Maybe you can find the light
Maybe you can find the light
Maybe you can find the light
Maybe you feel
And I feel
Maybe you can find the light
(oh and maybe you feel it too)
Maybe you can find the light
With you
I find the light
And I feel it
Maybe you can find the light
Maybe you can find the light
Maybe you can find the light
Maybe you can find the light
I can't save you
I can't save you
You can't find it here
You can't find it hereEmbed
