Sandy LyricsTime after time, girl
Like Daedalus' child
You wasted your mind, girl
You had to be wild
Now I see that you're lost
I gotta pain for you
Don't think 'bout what you've done
But what you can do
Time flies when you're having fun
But where does it go?
You flew too close to the sun
Now you just don't know
I can't believe the things you say
You couldn't mean them anyway
You tried to give me a run-around
But I ain't gonna let you run my town, no
I can't believe the things you say
Time after time, girl
Like Daedalus' child
You wasted your mind, girl
You had to be wild
Now I see that you're lost
What's you gotta do?
Those t's you left uncrossed
Are coming back to you
Time flies when you're having fun
But where does it go?
You flew too close to the sun
Now you just don't knowEmbed
