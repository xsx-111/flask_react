Seven Point Five LyricsTook the beat of your heart
Wore it around my neck
Take it where I go
So I don't forget
All the things you swore were your's alone
Found out I can't get them on my own
I'm gonna find her
Anywhere I can
Gonna get back
To her or go insane
I would love to have you by my side
But I ain't gonna wait for the morning tide
Rode up on a hill
With a girl I know
Said now "Listen babe
Something you should know
I ain't quite the guy you thought I was"
Said "That's quite alright, love you just because."
You're gonna find her
Anywhere you can
Gonna take me
Where I never been
I will love to stay on this ride
'Cause you ain't gonna change with the morning tideEmbed
