Catamaran LyricsOut on the water where you're gonna find me
All alone with my mind headed for a bounty
I've been living so long all by myself
I can't think of living with anybody else
I'm an oyster's pearl locked up in it's a shell
You better bring that diving bell
But I want you near
I want to whisper to your ear
I want to hold your hand
I want to be your man
Out on the river where you're gonna find me
All alone with my thoughts headed for a bounty
I've been living so long in a habitat
Where the land's mighty rocky but the river stays flat
Can you show me something, we can part with that
But I want you near
I want to whisper to your ear
I want to hold your hand
I want to be your man
I'm gonna get you girl
Like I got you
Wrap you up in paper, bite you
You're the pretty little thing that I gotta have
Cause I want itEmbed
