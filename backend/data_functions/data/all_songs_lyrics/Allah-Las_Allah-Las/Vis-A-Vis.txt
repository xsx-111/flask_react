Vis-A-Vis LyricsRemember when we were the best of friends
And you thought that we'd always be together
But things have changed
And some things can't be undone
But that doesn't mean it was all just a waste of time
And I'm not saying that things could've worked out fine
It's just what could've been keeps coming into mind
And now that what we had is gone I just want it back
When I see that photograph
Your hand in mine
In that sweet summer sunshine
And your smile seemed like it could last forever
But things have changed and I don't know what to do
So I sit at home and I stare at my telephone
And I'm not saying that things could've worked out fine
It's just what could've been keeps coming into mind
And now that what we had is gone
I just want it back
When I see that photographEmbed
