No Voodoo Lyrics
Look through you
'Cause I could get there
Look to you
'Cause I thought we went there

But I'm not like the kind that you had before
Not gonna run to that open door
Not gonna try to get what I wasn't givin'

But I can see that you long for yourself
I can tell
That you need to belong on a shelf
Time goes by
As you sit here and waste in your room
I can feel
That you need someone close real soon

Done a lot for you
Like the time before
When I came right through
Picked you off the floor
Spent a lot of time
Just to get your name
You were a friend of mine
Thought you felt the same
But I can see that you long for yourself
I can tell
That you need to belong on a shelf
Time goes by
As you sit here and waste in your room
I can feel
That you need someone's touch so soon
Done a lot for youEmbed
