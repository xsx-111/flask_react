Shark Lyrics
Head is pounding in a daze
Bruised wrists and your body aches
If you be mine, I'll be your mirror
Glide inside, I'll pull your trigger

Violent mind, violent mind, violent mind
Violent mind, violent mind, violent mind

I know what you wanna do
We're on the line
I know what you wanna do
You got a violent mind
I know what you wanna do
Eyes black and wide
I know where you're going to
Got a violent mind

Hedonistic, narcissistic
Erotic, nihilistic
Pupils wide, gonna slide inside
Gonna blow your mind
Violent mind, violent mind, violent mind
Violent mind, violent mind, violent mind

I know what you wanna do
We're on the line
I know what you wanna do
Got a violent mind
I know where you're going to
Eyes black and wide
I know what you wanna do
Got a violent mind

Violent mind, violent mind, violent mind
Violent mind, violent mind, violent mind

I know what you wanna do
We're on the line
I know what you wanna do
Got a violent mind
I know where you're going to
Eyes black and wide
I know what you wanna do
Got a violent mind
I know where you're going to
Eyes black and wide
I know what you wanna do
Got a violent mindEmbed
