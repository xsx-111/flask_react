World Domination Lyrics
One two three four
Woo!

Gimme, gimme world domination
We are the new sensation
Calling to the whole population
So spread the word across the nation
Gonna bring you heart palpitations
Gonna give you excitations
I am a godlike constellation
Gimme, gimme world domination

We're here to speak our mind
We won't take up much of your time
We want it and we want it now

Gimme, gimme world domination
Gonna feel our sonic vibrations
Our universal mind liberation
Is calling out to your situation
There will be no discrimination
We're gonna warp your imagination
'Cause you've been under sedation
Gimme, gimme world domination
We're here to speak our mind
We won't take up much of your time
We want it and we want it
We want it and we want it now
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Uh huh
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Woo

We're here to speak our mind
We won't take up much of your time
We want it and we want it now

Sorry to rain on your parade but we're here to stay
Gonna take out anybody that gets in our way
You know we don't give a fuck how we're meant to be
So gimme, gimme, gimme what belongs to me

Gimme, gimme world domination
We are the new sensation
Gonna blaze to our annihilation
Interplanetary destination
So gimme, gimme world domination
And spread the word across the nation
I am a godlike constellation
Gimme, gimme world dominationEmbed
