Nicole Lyrics
Guilt and pain
Haunting me everyday
Crushing me and I can't get away
Killing my heart and soul
Oh my Nicole
Still I don't know what to say
I'm tortured every night and day
It isn't in my control

I said no
I killed my baby but I loved her
I said no, no, no
I killed my baby but I loved her
(Oh my Nicole) I said no
(Oh my Nicole, oh my Nicole) I killed my baby but I loved her
(Oh my Nicole) I said no, no, no
(Oh my Nicole, oh my Nicole) I killed my baby but I loved her
I killed my baby but I

Snowy skies, far away still alive
Scars are healing in your mind
In your heart and soul
Oh my Nicole
I'm starting to realise
The fatal secret of my life
Isn't in my control
I said no
I killed my baby but I loved her
I said no, no, no
I killed my baby but I loved her
(Oh my Nicole) I said no
(Oh my Nicole, oh my Nicole) I killed my baby but I loved her
(Oh my Nicole) I said no, no, no
(Oh my Nicole, oh my Nicole) I killed my baby but I loved her

I killed my baby but I loved her
Still haunt me night and day
Oh my Nicole
Took a part of my life away
Oh my Nicole
I relive it every day
Oh my Nicole
Oh my Nicole

No
(Oh my Nicole, oh my Nicole) I killed my baby but I loved her
(Oh my Nicole) I said no, no, no
(Oh my Nicole, oh my Nicole) I killed my baby but I loved her
I killed my baby but I loved her
I killed my baby but IEmbed
