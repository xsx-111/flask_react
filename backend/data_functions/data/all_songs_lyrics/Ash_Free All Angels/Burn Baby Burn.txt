Burn Baby Burn Lyrics
You're all I have in this teenage twilight
Your golden hair and pale blue eyes
But through all the days and the sleepless nights
We have never been satisfied
Tumbling like the leaves
Yeah, we are spiraling on the breeze
Almost to the point of no return
Everything will burn baby burn

Look into my tired eyes
See someone you don't recognise
Binds that can't be untied
Oh, this is slow suicide
Feelings that I can't disguise
And never will be reconciled
Oh, something inside has died

You walk like you're in a daze
Unresponsive eyes in a distant gaze
Like all the good times have flown away
And the memory leaves a bitter taste
Tumbling like the leaves
Yeah, we are spiralling on the breeze
Destructive love is all we have
Destructive love is all I am
Look into my tired eyes
See someone you don't recognise
Binds that can't be untied
Oh, this is slow suicide
Feelings that I can't disguise
And never will be reconciled
Oh, something inside has died


Vicious, bitter words
Becoming more and more cruel
But you always take me back
And let me lick your wounds

Tumbling like the leaves
Yeah, we are spiraling on the breeze
Almost to the point of no return
Everything will burn baby burn

Look into my tired eyes
See someone you don't recognise
Binds that can't be untied
Oh, this is slow suicide
Feelings that I can't disguise
We're living in a compromise
Oh, something inside has diedEmbed
