Sometimes Lyrics
Can't sleep in the city
You're far away
Cigarettes keep you skinny
And your mind off the rain
Oh sometimes, sometimes
Oh sometimes, sometimes

Feelings are distant
And I know guilt by name
It was the hardest thing
Watching you slip away
Oh sometimes, sometimes
Oh sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes it happens, feelings die
Whole years are lost in the blink of an eye
We once had it all but events conspired
Oh, sometimes

Good morning, sweet thing
You're safe in my hands
I am no saint
But I understand
Oh sometimes, sometimes
Oh sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes it happens feelings die
Whole years are lost in the blink of an eye
We once had it all but events conspired
Oh, sometimes
Now that it is over, it is through
It gets me every time I think of you
Sometimes it happens, feelings die
Oh, sometimes

I miss your warm skin
Beside me at night
And I miss your flesh
In the dawn light
Oh sometimes, sometimes
Oh sometimes, sometimes


Sometimes, it happens feelings die
Whole years are lost in the blink of an eye
We once had it all but events conspired
Oh, sometimes
Saturn's decline in my star sign
Seasonal adjustments, stars realign
Sometimes it happens, feelings die
Oh, sometimes
SometimesEmbed
