Cherry Bomb Lyrics
Teenage queen, a sweet gamine
Immortal youth, a libertine
Is she real or just a dream?
My heart beats fast like Benzedrine

Every time that she walks by
Sends shivers down my spine
Makes me wanna die

She is out there on her own
Perfection in her chromosomes
She walks by, I need to know
Her blood red lips as soft as snow

Every time that she walks by
Sends shivers down my spine
Makes me wanna die
Oh yeah

She's a cherry bomb
She's a bullet in my head
Pull the trigger and I'm dead
Whoa oh oh, oh yeah
When she walks across the floor
Electric shock and my heart is raw
Is she real or just a dream?
My heart beats fast like Benzedrine

Every time that she walks by
Sends shivers down my spine
Makes me wanna die
Oh yeah

She's a cherry bomb
She's a bullet in my head
Pull the trigger and I'm dead
Whoa oh oh, oh yeah


She's a cherry bomb
She's a bullet in my head
Pull the trigger and I'm
She's a cherry bomb
Dream about her in my bed
Pull the trigger and I'm dead
Whoa oh oh, oh yeah
Whoa oh oh, oh yeah
Whoa oh oh, oh yeahEmbed
