Walking Barefoot Lyrics
Your beauty took my breath away
In awe all day
Your company was so relaxing
Easy going ways
We saw the first signs of summer and springtime change
Walking barefoot along the sand
I hadn't planned to stay

Yeah we've been walking barefoot
All summer
It'll be sad, my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit?

You are broke all summer
But you still sing
Don't need money when it's sunny
Don't need anything
Just need music and sun and laughter and no currency
The sun on your bare shoulders
It comes for free

Yeah, we've been walking barefoot
All summer
It'll be sad, my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit?
Yeah, we've been walking barefoot
All summer
Why can't we just design
To live like this all the time?
Why can't we just quit?
Sand ran through my fingers
And the land was hot
Anointed by Apollo
And his chariot
Disarmed by your charm that night, I felt it again
Addictive and consuming
Love's sweet pain

Yeah we've been walking barefoot
All summer
It'll be sad my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit

Our days are as the wind blows us
We are free
You've a quiet life out of town
Of coastal ease
And the wind, it has no pattern
We take life slow
And when the night has fallen
Our cup overflows
When the summer's gone
And the room is cold
When you're looking at the rain
And it just won't go
Remember when the sun was hot
And high up above
Remember when the days were long
And we were in love

Yeah we've been walking barefoot
All summer
It'll be sad, my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit?
Yeah we've been walking barefoot
All summer
Why can't we just design
To live like this all the time?
Why can't we just quit?Embed
