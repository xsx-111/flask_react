Candy Lyrics
Candy, such a joy to me
Inner city nights, I cannot sleep
Oh Candy, sweetest remedy
Only you can ease my troubled dreams
Angel, all people are the same
Caught up in bitterness and blame
Oh Candy, on dark and lonely days
I hear your voice whispering my name

Don't you know it's alright to be alone?
You can make it on your own, yeah
Don't you know it's alright to be alone?
You can make it on your own

Angel of the summer stars
I will always see you safe from harm
Oh Candy, we'll never be apart
Night and day, you're constant in my heart

Don't you know it's alright to be alone?
You can make it on your own, yeah
Don't you know it's alright to be alone?
You can make it on your own
Oh Candy, my dreams
Oh Candy, my dreams
Oh Candy, my dreams
Oh Candy

Candy, pure as driven snow
Come to me, you are not alone
Oh Candy, you're everything to me
You and I will always be free

Don't you know it's alright to be alone?
You can make it on your own, yeah
Don't you know it's alright to be alone?
You can make it on your own
It's alright to be alone
Don't you know it's alright to be alone?
You can make it on your own, yeah
Don't you know it's alright to be alone?
You can make it on your own, yeah
Don't you know it's alright to be alone?
You can make it on your own, yeah

It's alright to be alone
You can make it on your own, yeah
It's alright to be alone
You can make it on your own, yeah
It's alright to be alone
You can make it on your own, yeahEmbed
