Submission Lyrics
You turn me on, you turn me on
You turn me on, you turn me on
You turn me on, you turn me on
You turn me on, you turn me on
You turn me on, you turn me on
You turn me on, you turn me on
You turn me on, you turn me on
You turn me on, you turn me on
You turn me on, you turn me on
You turn me on

Sink into warm flesh
I wanna taste your skin
Wanna see you undressed
And see you shake your thing
You're bound and helpless
And burning from within
There for the taking
I wanna hear you sing

You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on
Submission
You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on
Submission
There's nothing I won't do
Even if it's wrong
To please you
That's where I'm coming from
You warp my senses
You're coming on so strong
I gotta go down
I gotta get it on

You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on
Submission
You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on
Submission

Submission
Submission

Sink into warm flesh
You got me in a daze
You give me fever
You hold me in your sway
You're my addiction
For you I'd take the pain
Yeah feel the friction
And take it all the way
You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on
Submission
You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on
Submission
You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on
Submission
You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on
Submission

Turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on
You turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me onEmbed
