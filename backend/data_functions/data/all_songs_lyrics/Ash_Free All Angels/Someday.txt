Someday Lyrics
Someday
We'll leave this town
It wears us down
We'll leave somehow
All its harm
And all its charms
Oh, someday

Someday
We'll leave behind
All this time
That has turned sour
Far behind
And out of mind
Oh, someday

Someday
We'll leave this life
Far behind
And fade in time
We'll look down
On this sad town
Oh, someday
Safe from harm
Was it a dream I had?
Was it a dream I had?
When did it turn bad?
Oh, safe from harm
Was it a dream?


Safe from harm
Was it a dream I had?
Was it a dream I had?
When did it turn bad?
Oh, safe from harm
Was it a dream I had?
Was it a dream I had?
When did it turn bad?
Oh, safe from harm
Was it a dream?

Someday
We'll leave behind
This sad life
And all its lies
All its harm
And all its charms
Oh, someday
We shall see
With clarity
And we won't look backEmbed
