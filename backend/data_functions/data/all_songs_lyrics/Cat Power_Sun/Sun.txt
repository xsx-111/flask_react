Sun LyricsHere comes, here comes, here comes the Sun
It’s hot, it’s hot, and close to us
Can guess, yes it is, here’s the day
We’re free, with me, we can finally run
If you catch a swing we can save the Sun
You come too close, and all is burning
Here it comes, here it comes, it’s still warm
Here it comes, here it comes, we’re all so tired of waiting
You said, you said who you are (You said, you said)
I wanna hear the answer to every question
It’s not that I never wanted, I just never knew
If you can, if you could lend you hand
This is the day people like we’ve been waiting for (O-oh-oh)
Waiting for (O-oh-oh)
Waiting for (O-oh-oh)
So tired of waiting
So tired of waiting
O-oh-ohEmbed
