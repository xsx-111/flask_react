Ruin LyricsI’ve seen gypsies who made it all the way
And kept going, kept rolling with nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

As far as I’ve seen from the bush
And the wilderness, to every known city
I’ve been to Saudi Arabia, Dhaka, Calcutta
Soweto, Mozambique, Istanbul, Rio, Rome
Argentina, Chile, Mejico, Taiwan, Great Britain
Belfast, to the desert, Spain
Some little bitty island in the middle of the Pacific
All the way back home, to my town
To my town
Bitching, complaining from some people who ain’t got shit to eat
Bitching, moaning, so many people you know they got
What are we doing?
We’re sitting on a ruin
What are we doing?
We’re sitting on a ruin

As far as I’ve seen from the bush
And the wilderness, to every known city
I’ve been to Saudi Arabia, Dhaka, Calcutta
Soweto, Mozambique, Istanbul, Rio, Rome
Argentina, Chile, Mejico, Taiwan, Great Britain
Belfast, to the desert, Spain, Tokyo
Some little bitty island in the middle of the Pacific
All the way back home, to my town
To my town
Bitching, complaining that some people ain’t got shit to eat
Bitching, moaning, so many people you know that they got
What are we doing?
We’re sitting on a ruin
What are we doing?
We’re sitting on a ruinEmbed
