Human Being LyricsYou've got a right
You've got a right
You've got a right, you're a human being
You're a human being
You're a human being
You're a human being
You've got a right to scream
When the dark one's here to stay
You've got a right to be
What you want and where you wanna be
You've got a right to breathe
To breathe
You've got a right
You're a human being
You've got your own voice so sing
You've got two hands, let's go and make anything
We all got rules we all have to break
We all have to make those mistakes
When I say, I know the way, I'm only trying
No don't nobody know where the road to life is really lying
See the people on TV get shot in their very own street
People just like you, people just like me
Can't you see you cut your hand on the advantages
You could stand to manage your damages
You, my dear, are a force to feed, not to fear
You've got a right to anywhere, anything
You've got a right, you've got a right
You're a human being
You've got a right to anywhere, anything
You've got a right, you've got a right
You're a human being
You're a human being
You're a human being
You're a human being
(x2)
Got a right, got a right, got a right, got a right
Got a right, got a right, got a right
Got a right, got a right, got a right, got a right
Got a right, you're a human beingEmbed
