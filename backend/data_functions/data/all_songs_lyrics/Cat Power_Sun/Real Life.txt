Real Life LyricsI met a doctor, he want to be a dancer
I met a mother, she want to be alone
I met a preacher, he want to be sinister
I met a kid, he want to be unknown
Nothing's wrong with helping the strong
Nothing's wrong with helping the strong
Nothing's wrong with helping the strong
Nothing's wrong to live your day long
Nothing's wrong to live your day long
Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong

Real life is ordinary
Sometimes you don't want to live (Want to live)
Sometimes you gotta do what you don't want to do
To get away with an unordinary life
I met a teacher, he want to be a dreamer
I met a sister, she want to meet her maker
I met a poet, he want to be a joke
I met a dog, he just want a bone
