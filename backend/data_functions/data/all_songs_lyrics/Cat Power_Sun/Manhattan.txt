Manhattan LyricsThe hotel above and the street below
People come and people go
All the friends that we used to know
Ain't coming back
Ain't coming back
Ain't coming back
You say your heart has a rhythm
Well see you got your secret on
You say hey and nothing to hide
You and your secret life
Don't look at the moon tonight
You'll never be never be never be Manhattan
Don't look at the moon tonight
You can never be never be never be never be Manhattan
Your badge and your suitcase on
Your suit and your hair's not right
Cause nobody knows this woman by your side
It's not who you know, it's the useful woman by your side
It's not who you know, it's a useful woman by your side
Manhattan
See your heart has a rhythm
Well see you got your secret on
She say hey and nothing to hide
You and your secret life
Don't look at the moon tonight
You'll never be never be never be Manhattan
Don't look at the moon tonight
You can never be never be never be never be Manhattan
See your heart has a rhythm
You got your secret on
And you say you got nothing to hide
You, you, you and your secret life
You'll never be never be never be Manhattan
Hollerin' at me hollerin' at you
Hollerin' at me hollerin' at you
Liberty in the basement light
Free speech, lipstick and the moonlight
Howling to get me, howlinâ€™ to get you
In Harlem, in a dark back room
Dancing to a different tune
Howling at me, howling at you3Embed
