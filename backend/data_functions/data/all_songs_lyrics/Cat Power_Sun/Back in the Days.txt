Back in the Days LyricsRemember back in the days
I used to abstain
Jump across before daybreak
Back to '92 again
Drinking brew again
Never going back to school again
I used to abstain, abstain, abstain
Dressed in white
Running in the rain
And I never complained
Now I'm in all black
'Cause I'm stacked
With mad guilt on my back
I've given my name
I've given my name
I've given my name
I've given my name
Beat down like a freak down town
When nobody came on the bad days
How much medicine you wanna do you in
Pharmaceuticals
Coochie coochie
Always thought I'd be dead in a grave
It's a good day when you know you got cloud on a cloudy day
It's a good day when you know you got cloud on a cloudy day
I've given my name
I've given my name
I've given my name
I've given my name
Oh Mrs., let us discuss a suitor
Get up, shut up and get out the frame
With the win-win even with material bends
Let
Call me
Confident through the whole damn game
Always thought I'd be dead in a grave
I used to abstain, abstain, abstain
Always thought I'd be dead in a grave
I've given my name
I used to abstain, abstain, abstain
Always thought I'd be dead in a grave
I've given my name
I used to abstain, abstain, abstainEmbed
