Always on My Own LyricsI was always on my own
Look in my eyes and see the one
Funny nonsense, on and on
Tell me no lie, under your love
Back to back, tick tock, has begun
Look in my eyes and see the one
Funny nonsense, on and on
Tell me no lie, under your love
Back to back, tick tock, has begun
I am what you want
I am what you're not
I am what you want
I am what you're not
I want to live my way of living
I want to live my way of living
I want to live my way of livingEmbed
