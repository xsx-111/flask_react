Silent Machine LyricsI walk on to the woods and the streets every night
Walk through people who walk too close
Into each other they're hanging
I am told there's a mother you may remember
In the name of the father but never the ghost
Me I use the money for those just as hard
Who hung his head for the ladies all pretended he dead
He dead! She dead!
He dead! We dead!
She loves she loves she loves you so hard
The one person to have, you cannot
The child he is a sinner, tell me teacher
To put on your light and then turn around
Silent machine is here to meet ya
Put on your lightnin, turn around
You lie, you lie, you lie, you lie, you lie
(Turn around, turn around, turn around, you turn around)
Silent machine is here to meet ya (meet ya)
Silent machine is here to meet ya (meet ya)
Silent machine is here to meet ya (meet ya)
Silent machine is here
If there ever was a religious figure
In my age, it don't count to have buttercup eyes
But you know some of us we see more than other eyes
She loves you, she loves you, she loves you so hard
The one person to have you can not
The child is a sinner, tell me teacher
You put on your light and then turn around
Silent machine is eating me child
You put on your light and then turn around
You lie, you lie, you lie, you lie, you lie
Silent machine is here to meet ya
Silent machine is here to meet ya
Silent machine is here to meet ya
Silent machine is hereEmbed
