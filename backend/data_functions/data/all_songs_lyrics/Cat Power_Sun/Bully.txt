Bully LyricsBoy, you were a bully
Through the grass and the river you chase
You were cruel, you were so mean
Laughing right in my face
All the while you had my back, my best friend
I can still feel that smile on my face
2007 was a good year, the best
The back of the bar watching me dance in a dress
Remember that night in Paris, all those candles you lit
I could never forget
You and all the alcohol
Sleeping on the street, sleeping on a train
Looking like a crook with a can to come back home
With a twist of your tongue and a devilish smile on your face
When you got sick
You were through with fun and games
Now that the times have all changed
I can’t find you
I can’t put you back into place
Nothing could be done
For this young, wild son
Standing on the street in a hospital sheet
On the run from the police
That dumb girl on your arm
And that look on your face
And all those crazy things you said to me
I can never forget
Everything you have to go through
With a smile on your face
Everything we now know, with a smile on our face
I, I can never forgetEmbed
