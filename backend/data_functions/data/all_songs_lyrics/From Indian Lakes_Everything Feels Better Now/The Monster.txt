The Monster Lyrics
I hate to say it, but it never felt quite right
I'm pointing fingers and I'm holding the knife
You want to stand around and stare at the night
We're only happy when we turn out the lights
I never told you it was going to be this way
I only said enough to get you to stay

But I don't want to live like that
Can I get back?
Can I get back?

I'm beginning to wake myself up
I've been dreaming of monsters in love
Now I can't get out the taste of blood
I'm beginning to wake myself up

I was a normal kid, no one could see
I had a monster growing in me
I always kept it down, I was always good enough
I was a body pretending to love

But I don't want to live like that
Can I get back?
Can I get back?
I'm beginning to wake myself up
I've been dreaming of monsters in love
Now I can't get out the taste of blood
I'm beginning to wake myself up

You're calling me out
You tell me not to sell myself so short
It's weighing me down
You don't want me to go on like this anymore

But I don't want to live like that
Can I get back?
Can I get back?Embed
