Feel Love Lyrics
When you laugh
You bring the whole house down to its knees
I'm alive
But only if you see me in front of you

You have yourself another drink
Then you go to bed
I haven't said another word
But I'm thinking it

And when you want to feel love
I can show you it
I can come around
And when you need to feel someone lying next to you
I can be the one

(I was warm)
And I was stuck inside where the people are
You were there, but something didn't feel right
You're a skeleton
I'm awake, and I can see everything from our bedroom
Are you there?
The ghost in my past life at the window
You have yourself another drink
Then you go to bed
I haven't said another word
But I'm thinking it

And when you want to feel love
I can show you it
I can come around
And when you need to feel someone lying next to you
I can be the one

All this time we've lost now
We can get it back
All this time we've lost now
We can get it back

And when you want to feel love
I can show you it
I can come around
And when you need to feel someone lying next to you
I can be the oneEmbed
