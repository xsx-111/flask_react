Nome Lyrics
Waking up
I was numb
The prediction I made was true
Lying fun
I could touch
With communication I am blue

All that's left is just hanging there for us too
Pull us out with the lower hanging fruit

(No we're easier)
Understand
Hold their hand
Slipping through to the floor
(You're going to get it bad
You don't know what's out there
You're the closest thing I've had
You don't know what's out there)

All that's left is just hanging there for us too
Pull us out with the lower hanging fruit
All that's left is just hanging there for us too
Pull us out with the lower hanging fruit
And it's pushing us out as it fills up the room
And it's pushing us out as it fills up the room
And it's pushing us out as it fills up the room
And it's pushing us out as it fills up the room
And it's pushing us out as it fills up the room
And it's pushing us out as it fills up the room
(All that's left is just hanging there for us too)
And it's pushing us out as it fills up the room
(Pull us out with the lower hanging fruit)Embed
