Blank Tapes Lyrics
You used to come alive
In the darkness, you held a light
In the basement, you held them tight
You would watch them night after night
You take them out and you dust them off
Are you the star? Are you meant to watch?
Are they the faces you used to know?
Are we okay? Are you all alone?
(Are you okay?)
They used to hold you up
Float over everyone
You had a warm bed you never saw
Are we okay? Will you sleep it off?
(Are you okay?)

And now we're wandering in blank space
But we can't shake ourselves awake
(And now it feels okay)
We try to fill our heads with blank tapes
And we tape over everything
(And now it feels okay)
Take back your bitter words
You're a ghost now, you never learn
Are you the hands of a ticking clock?
Are we okay when the ticking stops?
(Are you okay?)

And now we're wandering in blank space
But we can't shake ourselves awake
(And now it feels okay)
We try to fill our heads with blank tapes
And we tape over everything
(And now it feels okay)

And now it feels okay
And now it feels okay
And now it feels okay
And now it feels okayEmbed
