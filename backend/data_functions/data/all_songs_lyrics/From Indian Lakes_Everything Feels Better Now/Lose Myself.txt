Lose Myself Lyrics
I'm waking up in a cold sweat
Thought I saw you in the undertow
And now you're pulling me in again
I try to hide but I'm much too slow
It's something I've never felt before
A drug that never completely leaves
A silhouette in an open door
I try to hide but it's beckoning

I think I'm starting to lose myself in your love
I think I'm starting to lose myself in your love

I feel the walls getting closer now
Paintings of you everywhere I look
My feet are stuck to the concrete
Am I the worm on a lover's hook
And now I'm right where I'm supposed to be
But something still feels wrong with me

I'm think I'm ready to lose myself in your love
I'm think I'm ready to lose myself in your love
I'm think I'm ready to lose myself in your love
I'm think I'm ready to lose myself in your love
I'm think I'm ready to lose myself in your love
I'm think I'm ready to lose myself in your love
I'm think I'm ready to lose myself in your love
I'm think I'm ready to lose myself in your loveEmbed
