Happy Machines Lyrics
I wasn't making sense
You were lying there
Just waiting for me to speak
You want to be my friend
You were hoping I could change
But I stay the same
And everything feels better now
They told me to say
Now everything coming from your mouth
Will keep you safe

(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)

The color left your eyes
They were pulling you away
In a moment you're gone
We make another friend
We go on with it
And everyone moves on
Will anything come back again?
I can't find the words
Do I hear the sound of another's voice?
We can make this work
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better now
Everything feels better now
Everything feels better now
(But you know)
Everything feels better nowEmbed
