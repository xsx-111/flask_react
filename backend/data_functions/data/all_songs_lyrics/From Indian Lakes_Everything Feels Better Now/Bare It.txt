Bare It Lyrics
I was on the table
Cut open for you all to see
In a deep sleep
I can't feel a thing
Pay for more incisions
But you demanded it for free
It's my soul you want and a cage for me
I was only wasting time
Just holding on to sanity
It's a bitter taste, these melodies

You say you want to feel that love
I chased it down and boxed it up
They're throwing flowers at me
They're on the ground collecting dust

I was spinning fables
While you were picking at my seams
It's a lonely stage, full of apathy
No one tells you where to hide
But everyone knows everything
It's a pointless game
It's all make-believe
You say you want to see my blood
You push me down, is that enough?
They're throwing dollars at me
I'm on the ground, I can't get up
Is that enough?Embed
