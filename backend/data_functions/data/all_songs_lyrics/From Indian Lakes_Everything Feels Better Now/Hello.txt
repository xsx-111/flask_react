Hello Lyrics
Go on
Go on this way
Get out
Get out, be new
Head up
Head up, move on
No doubt
No doubt, she's gone

No more time and I'm evicted
Nothing comes to mind to get you back
And it comes around again
And it comes around to say hello
You were mine and I'm addicted
Too much comes to mind and eyes roll back
And it comes around again
And it comes around to say hello

Washed up
Washed up to shore
Drink up
Drink up, she's pure
Hold out
Hold out the earth
One shout
One shout unheard
No more time and I'm evicted
Nothing comes to mind to get you back
And it comes around again
And it comes around to say hello
You were mine and I'm addicted
Too much comes to mind and eyes roll back
And it comes around again
And it comes around to say helloEmbed
