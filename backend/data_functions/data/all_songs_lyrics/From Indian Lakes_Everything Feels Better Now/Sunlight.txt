Sunlight Lyrics
You climb back out of your hole
We wait around until the scenery takes us
It's taking over your soul
You're on the ground
And then you burst
And you're weightless
I want to be with you there
I can't keep up with it
The world overtakes us

You're standing in the sunlight
I want to be the dream that you see at night
You're looking for the other side
I want to be the one who could save your life

Are we apart of the earth
You're like a dream I never thought to wake up from
Another fall in the dirt
You're like a prison I could never get out of

I want to follow you down
I think we're loosing you now
You're gone
You're standing in the sunlight
I want to be the dream that you see at night
You're looking for the other side
I want to be the one who could save your life
You're standing in the sunlight
I want to be the dream that you see at night
You're looking for the other side
I want to be the one who could save your lifeEmbed
