Rid of It Lyrics
Everyone is leaving
Are you not the same
I can hear the weeping
But you're far away
When I was a child in the hospital
You were sitting in the pews
With your head hung low

How can I remember it
I can never rid of it
How can I remember it
I can never rid of this
How can I remember it
I can never rid of it now

Everyone is bleeding
Are you not the same
Falling into pieces
Are you not to blame
I was waiting in the car
But you never came out
I think I took it too far
Will I come back down
How can I remember it
I can never rid of it
How can I remember it
I can never rid of this
How can I remember it
I can never rid of it nowEmbed
