Come Back Lyrics
You were breaking up in the room next door to mine
I'm not asleep yet
I could hear the screaming
But you told us you were just fine
And go back to bed
It's coming up slowly now
And I can't hold it in
They're trying to hold me down
I'm choking on the medicine

Now you're telling me not to cry
I don't want to hear
I don't want to hear that
Are you telling me you're surprised
You don't want to feel
You don't want to feel bad
So you don't

Was I never afraid you were never ever coming back
Was it always this way
You were never ever coming back

I was breaking bottles
You were there but you didn't speak
I said I was sorry
But you wouldn't take my calls for weeks
I'm loosing you slowly now
My fingers they start to slip
They're telling me to quiet down
You're telling me you're over it
Now you're telling me not to cry
I don't want to hear
I don't want to hear that
Are you telling me you're surprised
You don't want to feel
You don't want to feel bad
So you don't

Was I never afraid you were never ever coming back
Was it always this way
You were never ever coming back
Was I never afraid you were never ever coming back
Was it always this way
You were never ever coming back
Was I never afraid you were never ever coming back
Was it always this way
You were never ever coming back
Was I never afraid you were never ever coming back
Was it always this way
You were never ever coming backEmbed
