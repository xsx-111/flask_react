Sedated Lyrics
Just a little rush, babe, to feel dizzy
To derail the mind of me
Just a little hush, babe; my veins are busy
But my heart's in atrophy

Any way
To distract and sedate
Adding shadows
To the walls of the cave

You and I, nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it

Something isn't right, babe; I keep catching
Little words, but the meaning's thin
I'm somewhere outside my life, babe; I keep scratching
But somehow I can't get in
So we're slaves
To any semblance of touch
Lord, we should quit
But we love it too much

Sedated, we're nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it

Darlin', don't you
Stand there watching, won't you
Come and save me from it?
Darlin', don't you
Join in, you're supposed to
Drag me away from it...
Any way
To distract and sedate
Adding shadows
To the walls of the cave

You and I, nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it

Sedated, we're nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it37Embed
