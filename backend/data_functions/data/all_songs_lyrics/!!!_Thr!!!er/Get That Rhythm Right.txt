Get That Rhythm Right LyricsThere are those who wear regrets
Like some kind of badge
So proud of what we all have
But I don't cry about the could'ves
Worry bout the would'ves
And I sure don't give a shit about the should'ves
So you think you've had it tough
Had it tougher than the rest of us
You just couldn't take it when it got too much
Should've known then you would end up
Just like every other coulda been a contender
Telling boring stories how you'd rather remember
Once you get that rhythm right
Baby, it's hard to say good night
Once you get that rhythm right
Who's asking?
I suppose it's never enough
You get what you want, then you want what was
But I'd rather worry about my existential crisis
Laying on a beach where the sun sets the nicest
Once you get that rhythm right
Baby, it's hard to say good night
Once you get that rhythm right
It's hard to live another life
Who's asking?
Pushed aside, but he didn't fight back
It's your life, shouldn't treat it like thatEmbed
