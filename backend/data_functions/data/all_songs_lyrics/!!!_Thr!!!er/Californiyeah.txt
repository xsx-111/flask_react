Californiyeah LyricsIt's been awhile since you've seen that sunshine
She asked me why and I said trouble on my mind
That ain't right, that ain't right
She said there's trouble everywhere
There's trouble all the time
You're always looking for something you'll never find
That ain't right, that ain't right
But I been up and down the 101, the 5, the 99
At least I know that it ain't there
And that's why I left it behind
That ain't right, that ain't right
California's in my heart
Though currently it's torn apart
But I'll make it back there someday
If I have my way
She said how could you leave that pacific ocean true?
Ain't no one over there who knows you like I do
That ain't right, that ain't right
But that's just it, we know it too well
You don't see the view
When you know it too well
Sometimes you forget it's blue
That ain't right, that ain't right
Now I miss California almost as much as I miss you
But why would I live somewhere
Where the bars close at two?
That ain't right, that ain't right
California's in my heart
Though currently it's torn apart
And if you've ever seen it
Then you know what I mean
California's in my mind
Not just now, but all the time
But I'll make it back there someday
If I have my way
I miss Sac and I miss the bay (ain't that right?)
I miss Fresno, and I miss LA (ain't that right?)
And I miss the Yuba river in the summertime
(Ain't that right?)
And you know I miss those girls so fine
(Ain't that right?)
But I hope to make it back someday (ain't that right?)
If I have my way (ain't that?)
And if you've ever seen itEmbed
