Slyd LyricsNo, that's weird
Slyd, slyd, slyd, you like the inside
Slyd, slyd, slyd, you like the inside
Slyd, slyd, slyd, you like the inside
I don't really like you but I like you on the inside
Ain't it funny
Ain't it funny
Ain't it funny
Ain't it funny
Ain't it funny
(Yeah, that's good)
Ain't it funny
Let's go somewhere we can be alone
Let's go somewhere and be alone
Let's go somewhere we can be alone
Let's go somewhere and be alone
Let's go somewhere we can be alone
Let's go somewhere and be alone
Let's go somewhere we can- Yeah, that's good
And it's a natural fact
And it's a natural fact
And it's a natural
And it's a natural
And it's a natural fact
My, my mind is on the inside
My, my mind is on the inside
My, my mind is on the inside
I don't really like you but I like you on the inside
Won't you get down, won't you get down
Won't you get down, down on the ground
Won't you get down, won't you get down
Won't you get down, down on the ground
Ain't it funny
Ain't it funny
Ain't it funny
Ain't it funny
Ain't it
Get off of yourself and uhm
You go get in love this time
You go get in love this time
At the REC-Enter
You go get around
You go around this time
At the REC-Enter
You go get around
You go around this time
You go get around
You go get around
You go get around thisEmbed
