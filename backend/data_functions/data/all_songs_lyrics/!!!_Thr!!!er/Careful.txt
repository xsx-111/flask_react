Careful LyricsIn the white, in the white, in the wite
White lie
Always closer, over the shoulder
In the white
White lie
Careful now, you can't expect
To get more than the typical regrets
Probably isn't cause to worry
It's just that the lines gets so blurry
Be careful to your promises
In the blank, in the blank, in the blank
Blank stare
Ain't no answer, any closer
In the blank
Blank stare
Certain things you have to tell
Certain things, it's just as well
Careful now, you can't expect
To get more than the typical regrets
Probably isn't cause to worry
It's just that the lines gets so blurry
Be careful to your promises
Careful nowEmbed
