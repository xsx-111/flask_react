One Girl / One Boy LyricsWell I heard it, playing soft
From a drunken bar's jukebox
And for a moment I was lost
In remembering, what I never forgot
And I never felt guilt about
The trouble that we got into
I just couldn't let that honey hide inside of you
And just because now it's different
Doesn't change what it meant
And when I hear that song
You know I'm only gonna
Think about one girl
I think about you
When I sing this song
You know I'm only gonna
Sing it for one girl
Ooh ooh ooh
Well I heard it, playing loud
I never knew what it was about
Till I fell silent in a crowd
I just turned around and walked straight out
'Cause I guess I felt guilty
About the trouble that I caused you
Putting myself first, just like I always do
But that doesn't change how I feel
'Cause when I hear it, it feels real
And when I hear that song
You know I'm only gonna
Think about one boy
I think about you
And when I sing this song
You know I'm only gonna
Sing it for one boy
Ooh ooh ooh
Well, I can't forget
Things you said or your kisses
And I keep your secrets
Where I keep your promises
But you need my confessions
About as much as you need my lies
And I guess it took that song to make me realize
