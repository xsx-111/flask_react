Station (Meet Me at The) LyricsThey say you can't always get what you want
And they try to say you get what you need
Well, that sounds nice to me
But it ain't nothing but a dice roll
I say you get what you get
It don't matter where your sympathies lie
If you ain't got a glimmer in your eye
You might end up knighted minister of cool
Might end up floating dead in a pool
Meet me at the station
Meet me 'bout half past nine
As per our conversation
We'll be closer to fine
If we hedge our bets
Hold tight, let's get what we want now, baby
Well, it's a long walk to freedom
And then a long way home
There ain't no one you can call up, crying on the phone
There ain't no broken heart like your own
Well, I say, forget him, forget her
There ain't nothing lasts forever
Don't marry anyone that don't like The Beatles
Don't marry anyone, it'll work out even betterEmbed
