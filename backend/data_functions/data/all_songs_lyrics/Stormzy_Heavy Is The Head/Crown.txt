Crown Lyrics
Searchin' every corner of my mind
Lookin' for the answers I can't find
I have my reasons and life has its lessons
I try to be grateful and count all my blessings
But heavy is the head that wears the crown

Amen, in Jesus' name, yes, I declare it
Any little seed I receive, I have to share it
Bruddas wanna break me down, I can't bear it
But heavy is the head with the crown, I still wear it
You can't hold me down, I still cope
Rain falling down at the BRITs, I'm still soaked
Try to put a hole in our ship, we'll build boats
Two birds with one stone, I'll kill both (One)
Pray I never lose and pray I never hit the shelf (Two)
Promise if I do that you'll be checkin' on my health (Cool)
If it's for my people, I'll do anything to help
If I do it out of love, it's not to benefit myself, ooh
Gotta stay around, but make a comeback too
I know my only mother wants her son back too
They sayin' I'm the voice of the young black youth
And then I say, "Yeah, cool," and then I bun my zoot
And now I'm
Searchin' every corner of my mind
(Search every corner, look for the answers)
Lookin' for the answers I can't find
(No, I can't find 'em, no silver lining)
I have my reasons and life has its lessons
I try to be grateful and count all my blessings
But heavy is the head that wears the crown

Amen, in Jesus' name, oh yes, I claim it
Any little bread that I make, I have to break it
Bruddas wanna break me down, I can't take it
I done a scholarship for the kids, they said it's racist
That's not anti-white, it's pro-black
Hang me out to dry, I won't crack
All these fancy ties and gold plaques
Never had no silver spoons in our mouths, we sold, like
Don't comment on my culture, you ain't qualified
Stab us in the back and then apologise
If you knew my story, you'd be horrified
The irony of trappin' on a Boris bike
Gotta stay alive and save my brother as well
Look at all these legends on the cover of Elle
Long time comin' but we come to prevail
I guess a little bit of heaven has to come with the hell, you know?
Searchin' every corner of my mind
(Search every corner, look for the answers)
Lookin' for the answers I can't find
(No, I can't find 'em, no silver lining)
I have my reasons and life has its lessons
I try to be grateful and count all my blessings
But heavy is the head that wears the crown

Heavy is the head that wears the crown8Embed
