Bronze Lyrics
Bronze
You man are getting bronze this year
Stormz

On this year, gone this year
Manna eat rice and stew and
Man, I'm strong this year
Big like John this year
Ball like Lebron this year
Storm's got a Platinum plaque
But you man are getting bronze this year, yeah

They wanna buy the flavors that we smoke
I said fuck that, you get free smoke
If I say this, they might revolt
But I'm the king of grime by default
Big ego, man can't diss my amigo
Old school bad boy like Figo
Anywhere the gang go, then we go
Aye yo, Big Flipz, hop out the jet first
Man, I'm running to the money 'til my legs hurt
And you niggas don't rap, you just network
Name a young MC with my net worth
Oi, Google lied, they said that I'm 1.5
But I made that last night
And money don't make me fried
But they got mad when I said I made a milli' off grime
These gatekeepers are pricks
And you old guys make me sick
They just take the P, take the mick
So, in other words, suck my dick
I phone Crazy T, like "Yo, Titch
You was right about him, he's a bitch"
Ain't no diss tracks, I just switch
Then we move on and get rich
On this year, gone this year
Manna eat rice and stew and
Man, I'm strong this year
Big like John this year
Ball like Lebron this year
Storm's got a Platinum plaque
But you man are getting bronze this year

She said, "I don't mean to intrude, but I love the smell of your Oud"
I said, "Thanks, baby, yours too" (Yours too)
Big Mike, I'm a real fly dude (Fly dude)
If I'm in the race, I won't lose (Lose)
When you hit the stage, you get booed (Booed)
If I punch your face, I get sued (Sued)
You ain't bad, you're just rude (Too rude, man)
Lamborghini too sporty (Skrrt)
She ain't bad, she just naughty (Ahh)
I'ma big man, but I'm not 40 (Yeah)
Anything that I drop, Top 40 (Yeah)
Why them boys don't support me? (Why?)
All them boys are too hatey
I don't know, they just hate me
Over or underrate me, humble them maybe
On this year, gone this year
Manna eat rice and stew and
Man, I'm strong this year
Big like John this year
Ball like Lebron this year
Storm's got a Platinum plaque
But you man are getting bronze this year
On this year, gone this year
Manna eat rice and stew and
Man, I'm strong this year
Big like John this year
Ball like Lebron this year
Storm's got a Platinum plaque
But you man are getting bronze this year2Embed
