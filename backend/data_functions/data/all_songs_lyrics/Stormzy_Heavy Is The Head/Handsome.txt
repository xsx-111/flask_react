Handsome Lyrics
Ayy, yo, it's Heavy Papa
AKA Heavy Duty, don't hide the beauty
Representing Kanka always
Top militarian, the Jamba boys
The goal is to touch your soul
Everywhere I go, I make it warm
I would never inform, but I'm fully on form
I'll bring the fire, Stormzy bring the storm
Yeah, flavour
Flavour

First things first, I'm a real G (Word)
How's a tweet on Twitter gonna kill me? (How?)
If I ain't the G.O.A.T., then I will be (True)
They know this, so they seven figure deal me, oh, do you feel me?
Facts why I'm still on (Yeah)
And I still got racks for my real don (Boy)
And we used to bang your shit
Now your album, it's just something that we built on
I look around and there ain't no love now
Scream "Fuck them all," I'm on crud now
Wanna call me bro like we're blood now
Word to Capo Lee, it's all mad now, like
I still stir on a brudda while you're there with your bros (Yeah)
In the big boy satin, make you tear for your clothes (Yeah)
See the fear in your eyes, man are scared of the flow (Yeah)
Still man of the year five years in a row, I
Still don't do police
Cah they act like they care when they do the least, and
Every time I drop a new release
Gyally pull up to my door like I'm Uber Eats, I flex
I let the fool boy do the deets
When I'm tourin', I do the streets
It's all calm 'til you're caught on a rope for your stupid tweets
And then you act like you're new to beef
I thought I told you
Young, black, fly, and handsome
Burn down the rave like I'm Rachael Anson
Young, black, fly, and handsome
Burn down the rave like I'm Rachael Anson
Young, black, fly, and handsome
Burn down the rave like I'm Rachael Anson
Young, black, fly, and handsome
Burn down the rave like I'm Rachael Anson

It's like I'm young, black, fly, and handsome
Burn down the rave like I'm Rachael Anson
Peng tings wanna hold me at ransom
I go booth and make an anthem
I just drop the heat and do tour
From Amsterdam to New York
You won't bust your gun, you a dork
Go suck your mum through a straw
'Ight, calm down, don't get defensive
Oh, this flow is so expensive
I can't let you niggas rent this
They shall try and reinvent this
They shall try and they will fail
All my G's, they buy and sell
Rude boy, I should be in jail
For these riddims that I push through my clientele
Alright, look, I'm young, black, fly, and cool
Think that's how I got by in school
Man get books, start buyin' jewels
Them man get shook, start buyin' tools
Oh, man, you bunch of lyin' fools
Rude boy, diss me if you dare
Then she whispered in my ear
Said, "Gunshot Mike, we've missed you bare"
It's like I'm
Young, black, fly, and handsome
Burn down the rave like I'm Rachael Anson
Young, black, fly, and handsome
Burn down the rave like I'm Rachael Anson
Young, black, fly, and handsome
Burn down the rave like I'm Rachael Anson
Young, black, fly, and handsome
Burn down the rave like I'm Rachael Anson1Embed
