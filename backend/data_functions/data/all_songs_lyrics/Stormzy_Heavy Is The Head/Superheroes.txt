Superheroes Lyrics
Don't die on me
I said

Young black king, don't die on me
You my brother, you my keeper, I need you to keep an eye on me
And no more fightin' on the streets
Walking 'round with all this pride on me
Well, shit, shit's tough for us already, know that you can still rely on me
Please, just stay alive for me
And my young black queens, don't quit now
Yeah, you're the only ones that got us
I could never let my sis' down
You've been too strong for too long, yet still you never sit down
Wow, that's the power of your lovin'
And it's worthy of a king's crown
And still, you never let your kings down

Even though more time we don't deserve it
The picture isn't pretty but it's perfect
Tedious pressure so then I curve it
Serena or Venus, the way I serve it
I'm Malorie Blackman the way I sell books
I jump on the stage and then the world looks
All that bangin' on my door had my girl shook
Like, "Sorry officer, I only sell hooks"
Leave me alone, every little L I took I held it close to home
Live and you learn, they'll always hate me for my tone
For the shade of my skin and not the courage in my bones
Now I'm misunderstood, now feelin' like Nina Simone
They way I tour the world, would've thought that I was Simz
See her on stage, I know that women can be kings
I know that it's fucked, they're overlookin' what you bring
I know shit's all good, but it's just the little things
Black queen, you're immaculate
It's comin' at the world, they ain't ready for your magic yet
And that was never your fault, man, I guess they couldn't hack it yet
World domination and you ain't even takin' off your jacket yet
So effortlessly fabulous
And my young black kings, I hope it pays off
Go and show 'em what you're made of
Tryna scare us with some things that we are no longer afraid of
Men are superheroes, let me see you take off
I pray you never take your cape off

Even though more time we don't fly straight
But trust me, bro, I promise we gon' die great
Our burdens are heavy but we ain't lightweights
Our parents were legends, they had to migrate
So that's the reason not to sit around and chat shit
I'm from the place where Michael Dapaah made a smash hit
Where you can be a rapper if you rap sick
They're screamin', "What a flippin' time to be a black Brit"
We so alive, whole world want our demise, but know we ride
Try to push us all to the side, we know our rights
Now we get the whole of the pie, then go inside
When we see that Merky flag in the sky, just know it's 'ight
The way I top the charts, would've thought that I was Dave
I am young, black, beautiful, and brave
Know that it's fucked, they overlookin' what we gave
I know shit's all good so we pray for better days
Pray they're better than before (Better than before)
Young, black king, you are everything and more (You are everything and more)
I know one song's not enough to settle scores (Not enough to settle scores)
But from the bottom of my heart, man, I hope you're gettin' yours (Gettin' yours, gettin' yours)
Man, I hope you're gettin' yours (Get yours, get yours)
Young black queen, get your shine on
All I see is innovators and a bag of icons
You can go and ask the whole world where they got their style from
That's you, that's us, God's time and He never gets the time wrong
I guess we're just some ticking time bombs
We'll soon blow, boom

I can make my world come true
All my dreams will see me through
And if that won't get me down
My dreams will turn things all around
With a smile upon my face
I can see a better place
Doesn't matter what will come my way
Believe me now, I will win someday2Embed
