Big Michael Lyrics
Ayy, yo, Stormzy, G
I beg you, G, release music, fam
'Cause you know what? It’s gettin' me so mad, fam
Michael, what's wrong with you?
Fuckin’ pussio
Release some fuckin' music, man, dickhead
Big Michael
And it's like

Said I went mainstream, suck your mum (Mum, mum)
Not top two, top one (Top one, top one, top one)
Man must have thought I was dumb
What the fuck have you lot done? (Oh my days, oh my days)
Shellins
I made juice, life gave me lemons
You little fuckboys do my head in
Henry VIII, behead 'em, 'head 'em, 'head 'em
Can’t tell where I’m headin' (No)
Could be Glasto’, could be Reading (Yes)
I was on the field like Beding (Beding)
Dead him, dead him, dead him, dead him
Big Mike, I'm handlin' my weight
Big Mike, I'm standin’ with the greats
One week it's "Blinded By Your Grace"
Next week it's bang you in your face
Oh God, they love to wind me up
Got one by one, I line 'em up
Oh, you think you're Beckham? Try your luck
Big Michael's back, your time is up
Alright, check this
Man can't tell me 'bout stretchin' fivers
I was on my pushback, clips and drivers
Man wanna diss, then text in private
Dem man are cool, but the rest don't like us

I'm not scared of lions, bears
Who lie on prayers, dem threats won't find us
Man's not scared of ticks and spiders
Think man's scared of sets and cyphers? (What?)
What you talkin' about? I'm skilled (Skilled)
What you talkin' about? I'm real (I'm real)
Put a fork in your mouth, I'm trill (Too trill)
Big Mike bought a house in the hill (Right there)
No, I'm never in the trap, and I'm never with the strap
And your nigga ain't out on the field (No way)
They say I'm on this and they say I'm on that
What you talkin' about? I build
From the ground up
Put your arms down, put your crown up
You come a long way from playin' pound up
You either motivate or go round up
And the kettle cost thirty bof (Yeah)
That's why they givin' me dirty looks (Yeah)
I don't do it for the 'Gram, but I do it for my fam
And I do it for the Merky books
Cah we're still takin' up space
I told my niggas rise up
Guess we're just a bunch of young kings
We made our city light up
I turn my city right up
Big Michael's back, your time's up
Big Michael's back, your time's up
Big Michael's back, your time's up
