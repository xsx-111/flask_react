Kiss Your Past Good-Bye Lyrics
Finders keepers, losers weep
Down on 42nd Street
All barefoot children crying my-oh-my
I watched you on the avenue
While other men were havin' you
I think that you should let your caged bird fly

And kiss your past goodbye
A-kiss your past goodbye
A-kss your past goodbye, yeah
Kiss your past goodbye

I been so lost I must confess
I had my share of loneliness
But yeah, it's hard to keep a good man down
The loves you lost were all in vain
The past lives on inside your brain
I don't think you need those memories
Hangin' around, yeah

Goodbye
Kiss your past goodbye
You gotta let it fly
Kiss your past goodbye, yeah
Yeah yeah
(Kiss your past goodbye)
(Ooo, kiss your past goodbye)

And if that bird don't fly away
There just one thing I got to say

It's later than a deuce of ticks
Your broken heart, it needs a fix
You're feedin' off a high that would not last
And people, they don't seem to care
And sorry just don't cut it, yeah
It seems to me you're gettin' nowhere fast
So kiss your past

Or kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss your past goodbye
There's no more tears to cry, yeah
So kiss your past goodbye
Kiss your past goodbye

Or kiss your ass goodbye
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah!Embed
