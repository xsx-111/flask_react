Hole in My Soul Lyrics
I'm down a one way street
With a one night stand
With a one track mind
Out in no man's land
The punishment sometimes
Don't seem to fit the crime
Yeah, there's a hole in my soul
But one thing I learned
For every love letter written
Is another one burned
So you tell me how it's gonna be this time

Is it over?
Is it over?
'Cause I'm blowing out the flame

Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look, and you will find there's nothing there, girl
Yeah, I swear, I'm telling you, girl, yeah, 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where a garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, yeah, I should have known better
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose
Yeah, yeeeaaahhhh
I'm as dry as a seven-year drought
I got dust for tears
And I'm all tapped out
Sometimes I feel broke, can't get fixed
I know there's been all kinds of shoes
Underneath your bed
Now I sleep with my boots on
But you're still in my head
Something tells me this time
I'm down to my last licks

'Cause if it's over
Then it's over
And it's driving me insane

Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look, and you will find there's nothing there
Girl, yeah, I swear, I'm telling you, girl, yeah, 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where a garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, yeah, I should have known better
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Yeah, is it over?
Yeah, it's over
And I'm blowing out the flame

Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look, and you will find there's nothing there, girl
Yeah, I swear, I'm telling you, girl, yeah, 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where a garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, yeah, I should have known better
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose
Yeah, yeah
Yeahy yeah

(Good night Taj, good night Chelsea cha!)2Embed
