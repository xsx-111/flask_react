Nine Lives Lyrics
Whoooooaaaaaaa  yayeah!

Well well well
I feel just like I'm fallin in love
There's a new cool
Some kind of verbooty
It fits me like a velvet glove, yeah
And it's cool
Shu bop a doo ba
She talking to me Juba to Jive
Yeah, well, the girl's in love
No doubt about it
The moment of truth has arrived

And in a wink
The funk was all around me
And I think
I'm dead in love again

Nine lives, feeling lucky
Nine lives, live again
Nine lives, it ain't over
Nine lives, live for ten
I got good luck
In certain situations
I'm feeling like I hung the moon
And then at time
I'm so weak from loving
I couldn't even carry a tune, yeah
But now I'm back
Oh yes I am
I maybe fall apart at the seams
I had a nightmare
Believe me when I tell you
Nobody ever dies in their dreams

Yeah, I think I need a stay of execution
In a wink, I'm dead in love again

Nine lives, puss and booty
Nine lives, live again
Nine lives, it ain't over
Nine lives, live for ten

Well well well
Engine room to bombardier
Is this a dream?
I died and went to Heaven
She's enough to make you
Cry in your beer
How can a good thing
7 come 11
Slip into a fare thee well
And how can one man's
Little bit of Heaven
Turn into another man's Hell?
Yeah, I think I need a stay of execution
Yeah I know, I'm dead in love again

Nine lives, hello lucky
Nine lives, live again
Nine lives, it ain't over
Nine lives, try for 10
Nine lives, taking over
Nine lives, live again
Nine lives, it ain't over
Nine lives, live for 10
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah......
Nine lives, hello lucky
Nine lives, live again
Nine lives, it ain't over
Nine lives, live for 10Embed
