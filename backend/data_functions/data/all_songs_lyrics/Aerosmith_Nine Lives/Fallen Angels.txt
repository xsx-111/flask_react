Fallen Angels Lyrics
There's a candle burnin' in the world tonight
For 'nother child who vanished out of sight
And a heart is broken, another prayer in vain
There's a million tears that fill a sea of pain
Sometimes I stare out my window
My thoughts all drift into space
Sometimes I wonder if there's a better place

(Tell me)
Where do fallen angels go?
I just don't know
Where do fallen angels go?
They keep fallin'

Now the times is frightenin'
Can't ignore the facts
There's so many people
Just slippin' through the cracks
So many ashes are scattered
So many rivers run dry
Sometimes your Heaven is Hell, and you don't know why

(So listen)
Where do fallen angels go?
I just don't know (I just don't know)
Where do fallen angels go?
They keep fallin', fallin', fallin'
Yeah
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Somewhere out there there's a shinin' light
And I got to be with you tonight


And with all we're nowhere
We still pay the price
Yeah, the Devil seems to get his way
In downtown paradise, yeah

Where do fallen angels go?
I just don't know (I just don't know)
Where do fallen angels go?
They keep fallin', fallin', fallin', yeah
Where do fallen angels go?
(Tell me)
I just don't know (I just don't know)
Where do fallen angels go?
They keep fallin', fallin', fallin', yeah
There's a candle burnin'
