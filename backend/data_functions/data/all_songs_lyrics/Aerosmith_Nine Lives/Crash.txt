Crash Lyrics
Dum da na da na
You said you can't find anything better to do
(You drive me crazy, yeah)

Sittin' on a castle
On the floor with Esmeralda
Waitin' for the geezer
Captain Crunch to come around
Feelin' suicidal 'cause of certain situation
Hangin' from the stairs too long
I think I'm comin' down

It's time to crash
Losin' my mind. losin' my mind, losin' my mind
Yeah, it's time to crash. (crash, yeah)
It's time to crash
(Losin' my mind,  losin' my mind, losin' my mind)
Losin' my mind, it's time to crash (crash, yeah)

Doin' tons of colon blow
Stuffing it in every hole
Mile high and so am I
Watching Jimi kiss the sky
Salle diner becomes a blur
With everybody jammin'
Republicans begin to sin
The batwings start a slammin'
It's time to crash
(Losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' my mind)
It's time to crash (crash, yeah)
Crash
It's time to
Losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' my mind
Yeah, maybe it's a little late, but it's time to crash (crash, yeah)
You drive me crazy
You drive me crazy
You drive me crazy


Captain Billy Beamish
Put a lamb up on a rack
Thanks for coming, Billy
And we hope you're comin' back
The castle will be waiting
For the next bangers and mash
Blanche and Marsha Reznick
Put their marmite with their hash... ha ha ha

Crash
Losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' my mind
And it's time to crash (crash, yeah)
Uumm, crash
Losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' my mind
Well, crash (crash, yeah)
It's time to crash
Losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' my mind
Losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' my mind
Losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' my mind
Losin' my mind
