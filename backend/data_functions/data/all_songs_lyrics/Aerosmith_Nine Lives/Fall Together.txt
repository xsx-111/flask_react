Fall Together Lyrics
Looking through the looking glass
Looking back at me
I got X-Ray rear view vision
But I don't like what I see
Now, I'd should not bitch and moan
But there's not much I can do
When you're hangin' by a thread
And I'm hanging on to you

Baby, we can fall apart
Or we can fall together
It's a long, way down
We can make a new start
Never say never
We can fall apart
Or we can fall together
Fall together, fall together
Fall together

Now I know you feel compelled
When you're way down in the dumps
Every road can take some turns
And every road has got its bumps
Now you got to know yourself
Yeah, you got to play it smart
Because you'll suffer for your sanity
If you suffer for your art
Baby, we can fall apart
Or we can fall together
It's a long, way down
We can make a new start
Never say never
We can fall apart
Or we can fall together
Fall together, fall together
Fall together

Now honey, I got this feeling something's funny
But I don't know what it is
My knees are shaking, how amazing
And the ground's about to give
(Fall, yeah)

Baby, we can fall apart
Or we can fall together
It's a long way down
We can make a good start
Never say never
We can fall apart or we can
Fall
Baby, we can fall apart
Or we can fall together
It's a long way down
We can make a new start
Never say never
We can fall apart
Or we can fall together
Baby, we can fall apart
Or we can fall together
It's a long way down
We can make a good start
Never say never
We can fall apart
Or we can fall together
Fall togetherEmbed
