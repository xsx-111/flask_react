The Farm Lyrics
It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train
It's far, far away, behind the moon, beyond the rain
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore
Oaahh!

A-there's a cockroach in my coffee
There's a needle in my arm
A-and I feel like New York Cittay
A-get me to the farm

A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

I got terminal uniqueness
I'm an egocentric man
I get caught up in my freakness
But I ain't no Peter Pan
Get me to the farm

A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Get me
Buckle up straight jack
Sanity is such a drag
Jellybean thorazine
Transcendental jet lag
Sanity I ain't gotta
Feeling like a pi√±ata
Sucker punch
Blowing lunch
Motherload
Pigeonholed
I'm feeling like I'm going to explode

Yeah, I wanna shave my head
I want to be a Hare Krishna
Tattoo a dot right on my head
And the Prozac is my fixer
I am the livin' dead
Follow the yellow brick road
Follow the yellow brick road

A-take me to the farm
A-take me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm
Take me to the farm
A-take me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
A-take me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

And I'm sure to get a brain
Uh huh, uh huh
TonightEmbed
