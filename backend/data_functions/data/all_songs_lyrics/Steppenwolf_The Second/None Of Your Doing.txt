None Of Your Doing LyricsIf I could show you where I've been
Perhaps you'd know and never ask again
Could I forget the things I've seen
Perhaps I'd smile and we would be the same
I can't return to where you're goin'
What I have learned, it can't be undone
Don't blame yourself, don't you know
It was none of your doin'
All my faith got caught in a maze
Lost our dreams in a far a way place
Now that I have seen you again
Can't believe your world's still the same
Sometimes I slip into the past
When life was sweet
I thought that it would always last
It was so easy to believe that all is well
They always catch the thief
I can't return to where you're goin'
What I have learned, it can't be undone
Don't blame yourself, don't you know
It was none of your doin'Embed
