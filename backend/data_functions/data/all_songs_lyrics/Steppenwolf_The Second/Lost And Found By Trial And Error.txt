Lost And Found By Trial And Error LyricsSo, once again I hurt someone
Because I found out that she's not the one
I'm looking for
So, once again I blame someone
Because I know that she can't use the love
I have in store
And now she's gone
And I'm glad her story ends
Still I wish I had been kinder
We could have parted just like friends
So, one more time I've played, lost the game
Another face in the past, without a name
Back in the night to find a light
And hoping this time I'll be right
I know you don't know me
But I need your company
Don't wanna be alone tonight
You can trust me girl
You'll be alright
Looked at me with big brown eyes
She said "yes" to my surprise
And now I call her in the morning
And I see her every night
I see her in the evening
And when I'm with her, I'm alrightEmbed
