Disappointment Number (Unknown) LyricsI don't believe that I can hold you anymore
Now don't say good bye, walk out the door
Nobody's blaming you, I've been wrong before
Across the street I see shadows and candlelight
But I'm here all alone it just ain't right
You know across the street I see shadows and candlelight
You know it makes me feel like sighing
To hear their laughter in the night
The sky is crying
The tears roll down by window pane
So I go out walking in the rain
And I'm blue again
Hey gal you didn't treat me right
You got me walkin' round all through the night
Can't keep my feet still
I need someone but it sure ain't you
Got a little bit mad 'cause you couldn't be true
Somebody else will
Find me a bar, gonna spend my bread
Wake up next morning under the bed
Feel a lot worse like a man with an elephant's head
You know I need somebody but it sure ain't you
Got a little bit mad 'cause you couldn't be true
Somebody else will
You know I feel so mean
I could shoot down the morning sun
You know I feel so mean
I could shoot down the morning sun
But when you hurt someone
You know you wind up on the runEmbed
