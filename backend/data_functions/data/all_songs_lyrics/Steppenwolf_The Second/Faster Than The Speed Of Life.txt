Faster Than The Speed Of Life LyricsRide the waves of everlove
Let them throw you on the beach
Gathering experience
While it's still in your reach
Faster faster
Faster than the speed of life
Faster faster
Faster than the speed of life
Summer nights of secret fun
Moving farther out each day
Like a shooting star you're flying
Burning up what's in your way
Faster faster
Faster than the speed of life
Faster faster
Faster than the speed of life
Screaming through the walls of inhibition
Past the stream, you're breaking free
There you stand, unchained and in confusion
Spread your arms and come to me
Faster faster
Faster than the speed of life
Faster faster
Faster than the speed of life
Faster faster faster
Faster faster faster
Faster than the speed of lifeEmbed
