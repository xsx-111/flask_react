28 LyricsThey're talkin', talkin' about Molly
She's cryin', isn't it funny
I turned her without any money
She's 28 years old tonight
I told her not to fear, it's all very right
She listened and came to my side
Then whispered she wanted to ride
She slowed down right with the tide
She told me she's wormin' her knees
I touched her, she's started to breathe
She opened and let in the breeze
She's 28 years old tonight
I told her not to fear
It's all very night
Silk on silk
Feather and light
Make the black out of the night
Silk on silk
Feather and light
Make the black out of the night
She's 28 years old tonight
I told her not to fear
It's all very night
They're talkin', talkin' about Molly
She's cryin', isn't it funny
I turned her without any money
Next morning, two nights after
She woke up, grinning with laughter
I kissed her, she came at me faster
She's 28 years old tonight
I told her not to fear
It's all very night
Silk on silk
Feather and light
Make the black out of the white
Silk on silk
Feather and light
Make the black out of the white
