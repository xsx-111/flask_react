It Was a Pleasure Then LyricsIt was a pleasure then
Could you just be here again
To know what there was to see
When all the Sunday people
Were so quiet in the dark
Afraid to be better the next day
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
It was a pleasure then
When we could sit and stare again
Until the stars fell through
The cloudy trees onto the grass
Stars to smile with us
Until they too had tears in their eyes
You tell us this one tale
Of how much we must not agree
It was a pleasure then
To see the dying days again
In horror of the nights
Never never never
Never be too bright
We've got no secret
Heart to hide somewhere at last
As long as we could see
The sky confess this crime
Of bitter tasting hatefulness
Above our shattered minds
It was a pleasure
It was a pleasure
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la laEmbed
