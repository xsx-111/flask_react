Little Sister LyricsDon't call me home, little sister
Before the night is done
My love and I are fleeing
Running into the sun
Turn to fly, go away
Little bird, please don't stay
Fare thee well
Take up all your jewels and gold
Bury them away in the earth
Let your memory reduce them to dust
But don't forget the knife that was thrust
Turn to fly, go away
Little bird, please don't stay
Fare thee well
Frozen kiss by the fountain
Running into the sea
Where shadows choose their horrors
Designed for music
Turn to fly, go away
Little bird, please don't stay
Fare thee wellEmbed
