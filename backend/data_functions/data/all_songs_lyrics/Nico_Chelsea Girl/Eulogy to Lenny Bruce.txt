Eulogy to Lenny Bruce Lyrics
I've lost a friend
And I don't know why
But never again
Will we get together to die
And why after every last shot
Was there always another?
Why after all you hadn't got
Did you leave your life to your mother?

And Honey Harlow
The singer burlesque queen
How did she know
You needed morphine?
Why didn't you listen
To the warning words of your friends
While they told you so?
I know you couldn't listen
To people talk about
What they didn't know

I've lost a friend
And I don't know why
But never again
Will we get together to die
And why after every last shot
Was there always another?
Why after all you hadn't got
Did you leave your life to your mother?Embed
