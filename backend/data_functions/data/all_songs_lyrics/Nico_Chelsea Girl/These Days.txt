These Days Lyrics
I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had
The chance to

I stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days
These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my ways
And I wonder if I'd see another
Highway

I had a lover
I don't think I risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing
So long
La-la-la-la-la
La-la
I'd stopped my dreaming
I won't do too much scheming these days
These days
These days I sit on cornerstones
And count the time in quarter tones to 10
Please don't confront me with my failures
I had not forgotten them20Embed
