Spanish Moon (Live) LyricsGeorge
Well the night that I got into town
Was the night of the rain, it froze on the ground
Down the street I heard such a sorrowful tune
Comin' from the place they call the Spanish Moon
Well I stepped inside and stood by the door
While a dark girl sang and played the guitar
There was hookers and hustlers, they filled up the room
I heard about this place they call the Spanish Moon
There's whiskey and bad cocaine
Poison get you just the same
And if that... that don't... kill you soon
The women will down at the Spanish Moon
Well I pawned my watch and I sold my ring
Just to hear that girl sing, yeah yeah
I don't care who, you can wake up ruined
You can lose it all down at the Spanish MoonEmbed
