Rocket in My Pocket LyricsMy baby called me up
She said, "Why don't you ever take me out?
Pick me up in your brand new car
You shake the short change from your old fruit jar"
I put on my dancin' shoes
We headed straight for the rhythm and blues
The music was hot, but my baby was not
I've got a rocket in my pocketEmbed
