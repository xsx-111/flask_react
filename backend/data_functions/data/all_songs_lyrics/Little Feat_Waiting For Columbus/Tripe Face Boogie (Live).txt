Tripe Face Boogie (Live) LyricsWell I was buffalo-ed in Buffalo
And I was entertained in Houston
New York, New York you gotta choose one
It's a tripe face boogie
Boogie my sneakers away yeah yeah
I don't want your money
Don't want your time
Please don't jive me honey
And I'll give you back your dime
Hype face boogie
Boogie my scruples away yeah, yeah, oh
Well I can't dig potato chips
And I can't take the taunts
Tripe my guacamole baby, gotta
Tripe my in ya' in ya'
You gotta tripe my shorts
It's a hype cage boogiе
Boogie my sneakers away yеah
I said tripe boogie, a hype boogie
It's the right boogie
All night long...
You bring your guitar
I'll bring the wine
Blow out our speakers, just
One more time
It's a tripe face boogie
Lookout!
Good job raise some waves
I said: Lookout!
Good job raise some waves
I said
Lookout!
Good job raise some waves, oooh yeahEmbed
