Day or Night (Live) LyricsYou can say what you want
People runnin', talkin', it's all going on up and down the street
Young girls selling their wares, no cares
Ah, history's left its mark, aha
Old folks that were able
Now can table it at their own expense
They wouldn't miss it, they don't care if it's day or night
Oh the city she makes
Sometimes your soul to feel floating just like a leaf in the wind
Street is stream so it carries you past your present schemes 'til there is no end
Left right in the alley
No one catches you but the gentle wind
There ain't no Jane, no Jill, no Sally to see you through
There ain't no Jane, no Jill, no Sally to see you through
So you do what you want
And pretend again that it's time to roam 'cause you can't go home
Maybe you'll find your way today
But while you're at it you'll have some fun
And through tears of laughter
You know it's nothing until you find someone
You wouldn't miss it
You don't care if it's day or nightEmbed
