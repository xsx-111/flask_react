Time Loves a Hero LyricsWell they say that time loves a hero
But only time will tell
If he's real he's a legend from heaven
If he ain't he was sent here from hell
Hear me well
Seeing ain't always believing
Just make sure it's the truth that you're seeing
Eyes sometimes lie, eyes sometimes lie
They can be real deceiving
I got an uncle in Puerto Rico
Spends his days in the sun
And his nights in the casinos
He left the States many years ago
Took a fishing boat to Puerto Rico
Now my aunt she is sad and lonely
She'll never know that she drove him away
As a coward I admire his courageous ways
Well they say that time loves a hero
But only time will tell
If he's real he's a legend from heaven
If he ain't he's a mouthpiece from hell
Some say my uncle that he's a zero
His life as a shell, he left it back at Stateside
I'd say he's doing well without his shell
Bumming 'round the beaches of Puerto Rico
The beauty of the sunrise and sunset
To his friends he wish he could tell
They're at home still running for bells
Better San Juan than that blue collar hell
Well they say that time loves a hero
But only time will tell
If he's real he's a legend from heaven
If he ain't he was sent here from hellEmbed
