All That You Dream (Live) Lyrics
I've been down, but not like this before
Can't be 'round this kind of show no more

All, all that you dream
Comes through shinin' silver lining
Clouds, clouds change the scene
Yeah, rain starts washing all those cautions
Right into your life, and you start to realize
Just what is true, what else can you do
You just follow the rules
And keep your eyes on the road that's ahead of you

I've been down, but not like this before
I can't be 'round this kind of show no more

I've been down, but not like this before

All of the good, good times were ours
Ah, in the land of milk and honey
And time, time adds its scars
And those rainy days they turn to sunny ones
You're livin' the life, you're livin' the life lovin' everyone
I've been down, but not like this before
Can't be 'round this kind of show no moreEmbed
