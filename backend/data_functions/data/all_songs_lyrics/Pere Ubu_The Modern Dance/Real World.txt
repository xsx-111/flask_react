Real World LyricsOut in the Real World
(in Real Time)
City streets shine so brightly
Out in the Real World
(in Real Time)
Cindy makes a bad joke
Out in the Real World
(in Real Time)
Girlie Go Goodbye
Out in the Real World
(in Real Time)
Techniramic Heartache
Out in the Real World
(in Real Time)
What's that talk?
Girl talk!
Out in the Real World
(in Real Time)
I wander round
Okay!
Out in the Real World
(in Real Time)
Birdie Go Fly Fly
Bye Bye!
Out in the Real World
(in Real Time)
