The Modern Dance LyricsDown at the bus (merdre, merdre)
Into the town (merdre, merdre)
Our poor boy
Can't get around (merdre, merdre)
Eight fifty-five (merdre, merdre)
Down at the show (merdre, merdre)
She leaves early
He'll never know (merdre, merdre)
Cuz our poor boy (merdre, merdre)
Believes in chance (merdre, merdre)
He'll never get
The modern dance
Under the door (merdre, merdre)
An eye on the place (merdre, merdre)
He watches for
The shadows race (merdre, merdre)
Watch real close (merdre, merdre)
Look real fast (merdre, merdre)
He's in touch
It'll never last (merdre, merdre)
Cuz our poor boy (merdre, merdre)
Believes in chance
He'll never get
The modern danceEmbed
