Humor Me LyricsOh
Oh
It was the first thing that I saw
Oh, you never see that kind of Classical Girl
Understand that it was the first thing that I saw
That was fate
(It was the ballistics, mon!)
That was fate
It was a world, what a world!
What a world? What a big world
What a world to be drowned in
It's just a joke, mon!
It's just a joke, mon!
It's just a joke, mon!
Another day?
Well SUFFER, for that's the way of the west
SUFFER
Oh, it's a joke!
Oh, it's a joke!
Oh, it's a joke!
It's a joke!
Oh, it's a JOKE
Oh, that's a joke?
Hunh-unh
Well then humor me!
Well then humor me!
Well then humor me!Embed
