Over My Head LyricsIt's pretty cute the way she tucks me in at dawn
And how I pray that I never should sin again
Uh oh
Here it comes
It's goin over my head
It's over my head
In the gas her eyes are imagined
And what she sees cannot be detected
It's over my head
That, she said, and that went by
This, she says, and this may too
Oh no
There it goes
It's over my headEmbed
