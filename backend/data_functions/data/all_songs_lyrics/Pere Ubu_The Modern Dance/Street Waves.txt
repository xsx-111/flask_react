Street Waves LyricsI ride a street wave right by her side
And I can hear the city city comin round
The things I say hit the air and seem to fall apart
And I can see the faces faces fallin down
And then I'm
Gone
Gone
Gone by her heart
I get a picture of what it'll be like
I turn the channel round to Channel 43
I see electricity jump and spark
I see electricity uh real and stark
And then I'm
Gone
Gone
Gone by her heart
I ride a street wave right by her side
And I can hear the city city comin round
I see electricity jump and spark
I see electricity uh real and stark
And then I'm
Gone
Gone
Gone by her heart
And then I'm
Gone
Gone
Gone by her heartEmbed
