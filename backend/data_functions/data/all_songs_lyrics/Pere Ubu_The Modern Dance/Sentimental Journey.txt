Sentimental Journey LyricsWindow
My size
Outside
Monoxide
Inside
Paradise
Curtain
No breeze
Motion
Attraction
Here she comes
Girl
She says
Why don't you just go home?
I don't know
I guess I'll go home
Motion
Retraction
Down the hall
To the stairs
Down the stairs
To the street
Down the street
To the corner
Round the corner
Nowhere
Nowhere to go
I don't know
I guess I'll just go home
Motion
Attraction
Table
Chairs
Tv
Books
Other stuff
Home
It's home
