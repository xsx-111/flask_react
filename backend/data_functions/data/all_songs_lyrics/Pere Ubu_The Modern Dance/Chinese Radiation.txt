Chinese Radiation LyricsHe'll be the red guard
She'll be the new world
He'll wear his grey cap
And she'll wave her red book
He'll tell her
One way?
I want you all ways
One way
And then they'll sing
I was lost at sea
She was lost with me
Then across the broad horizon
Out on the Big Waves
I saw it coming
I saw the red guard
I saw the new world
I saw the Big Wall
Out on the Big Waves
Hooray!
(That's what I had to say)
Hooray!
We will purify
We must purify
For the sake of that security we all want
We will purify
He'll be the red guard
She'll be the new world
He'll wear his grey cap
She'll wave her red book1Embed
