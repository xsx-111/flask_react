Non-Alignment Pact Lyrics
I wanna make a deal with you girl
And get it signed by the heads of state
I wanna make a deal with you girl
Be recognized round the world
It's my

Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact (you better sign it)
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact

At night I can see the stars on fire
And I can see the world in flames
And it's all because of you girl
Or your thousand other names

Peggy, Carrie Ann and Betty Jean
Jill, Joan, Jan and Sue
Alice, Cindy, Barbara Ann, you know
It's all because of you
It's all because of you girl, you know
It's all because of you
It's all because of you girl, you know
It's all because of you, you better sign my
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact (you better sign it)
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact


Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact (you better sign)
Non-alignment pact (come on, come  on, come on)
Non-alignment pact (leave me alone)
Non-alignment pact (leave me alone)
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact1Embed
