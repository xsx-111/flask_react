If There Was No You LyricsWhen I see myself, I'm seeing you too
As long as I remember and I'm feeling like I knew
That my jokes aren't funny, the truth isn't true
If there was no you
If you were my boat in the deep blue sea
I'd probably sink you down
I know I should have thanked you for carrying me
But for you, I would happily drown
Out on your way, the darkest night, the longest day
I know what to say to make you laugh
And nothing you could do
Could make me turn my back on you
When you're looking for a fight, I'm your man
When you need a friend, you got my hand
What I really mean, what I'm trying hard to say
Is that I'm counting on you and you got me too
Our secrets aren't safe, I'm singing out of tune
If there was no you, if there was no you
Out on your way, the darkest night, the longest day
I know what to say to make you laugh
And nothing you could do
Could make me turn my back on you
When you're looking for a fight, I'm your man
When you need a friend, you got my hand
When you need a friend, you got my hand
You got my handEmbed
