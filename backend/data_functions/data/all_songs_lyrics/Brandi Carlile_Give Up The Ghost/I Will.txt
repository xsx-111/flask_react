I Will LyricsIt's not the end of the world
It's not even over, but it will be soon
I never learned my lessons, I just changed my tune
And no one seems to notice
But you will, you will
It's no big deal
But the last thing I think of when I close my eyes
And the first thing on my mind when I arise
It is a day and you're not really in my life
You can try and you won't find it where you're looking
You can hold it till it's putty in your hands
And you can't break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
And I will do the right thing
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
You're not fooling me
I'm not the sort of girl who can't see reason
But it's nothing that a little bit of time won't heal
I know it don't come easy, but I love you, I do
Coming clean
Means never closing curtains, I just changed my scene
Oh but you know what I mean
And I will learn throughout my life to never lean on what will bend
I can try and I won't find it where I'm looking
I can hold it till it's putty in my hands
You can't break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You could never be there for me in the end
But I will do the right thing
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I don't think you ever learned a thing from me
But I'm sure that you want me to learn from you
And you've drawn heavy-handed lines around morality
About yourself, and I don't share your point of view
It's been time to let you go a thousand times
You'd never know that it hurts to be the one that you'd regret
I have to say that I'm proud to know you
And I'll never be the same because we met
You might not miss this
And I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I willEmbed
