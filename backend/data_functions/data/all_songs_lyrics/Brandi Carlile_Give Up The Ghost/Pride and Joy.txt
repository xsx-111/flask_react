Pride and Joy LyricsTime of day I can't recall
The kind of thing that takes its toll
Over years and over time
Over smiles and over wine
All in all, it wasn't bad
All in all, it wasn't good
But I still care
That's the problem with the days
They're never long enough to say
What it is you never said
All the books you never read
I throw myself into the wind
Hoping somebody might pick me up
And carry me again
Where are you now?
Do you let me down?
Do you make me grieve for you?
Do I make you proud?
Do you get me now?
Am I your pride and joy?
I believe this to be true
Thereâ€™s nothing sacred, nothing new
No one tells you when its time
There are no warnings, only signs
Then you know that you're alone
You're not a child anymore
But you're still scared
All your mountains turn to rocks
All your oceans turn to drops
They are nothing like you thought
You can't be something you are not
Life is not a looking glass
Don't get tangled in your past
Like I am learning not to
Where are you now?
Do you let me down?
Do you make me grieve for you?
Do I make you proud?
Do you get me now?
Am I your pride and joy?Embed
