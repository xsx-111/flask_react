That Year LyricsI must have been sleeping
I must have been drinking
I haven't been dreaming about you for years
There was a sharp turn and a sunburn
I was too cool for high school that year
That year
It must have been New Year's
No one invited you, you took things too far
But I missed you and your antics
You were lonesome and blue-eyed
And so special to us
You should have taken a long break
Instead of a long drop from a high place
Ten years, I never spoke your name
Now it feels good to say it
You're my friend again
He said he forgave you, I said I hated you
He was the bigger man, I was sixteen
All the innocence it took for you
To finally make your yearbook
That year
That year
You could have taken some time away
Instead of a long drop
Instead of a leap of faith
Ten years, I never spoke your name
Now it feels good to say that
You're my friend again
You're my friend again
I was angry
I was a Baptist
I was a daughter
I was wrong1Embed
