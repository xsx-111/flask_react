Dreams LyricsDreams, I have dreams
When I'm awake, when I'm asleep
And you, you are in my dreams
You're underneath my skin
How am I so weak?
And now in my dreams
I can feel the way, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
How long can you hold your breath?
Can you count to ten? Can you let it pass?
Keep, can you keep it in?
Keep it behind latches, can you make it last?
And now in my dreams
I can feel the way, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
Oh, and I have dreams, I have dreams
Mind, can you read my mind?
Has it come undone? Am I showing signs?
Now in my dreams
I can feel the way, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
I have dreams, I have, I have, I have dreamsEmbed
