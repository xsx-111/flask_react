Oh Dear LyricsOh dear, out here
Everybody stumbles on fear
Who cares if we’re scared?
Everyone is on their own
It’s only you that my heart desires
Only you alone can know my pain
All alone, you were sitting there
Folding pages for your paper chain
Now you can cut me free (now you can cut me free)
Forever say goodbye (forever say goodbye)
Or we'll be holding hands and go on together
You and I forever
Heartbreaks, mistakes
Catching up to me in old ways
I know of hard days
Had my share of lonely nights
Its only you that my heart desires
Only you alone can break my fall
I pace the floor and I wish for more
While you were dreaming with your paper dolls
Now you can cut me free (now you can cut me free)
So when it all unfolds (so when it all unfolds)
We’ll be holding hands and go on together
You and I forever
Poor dear, out here
Everybody stumbles on fear
Who cares if you’re scared?
Everyone is on their own
Oh dearEmbed
