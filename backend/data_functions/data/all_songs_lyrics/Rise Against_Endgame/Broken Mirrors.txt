Broken Mirrors Lyrics
Hey man, now did you hear?
Your final days are near
In a free fall of fire and ice
And explosions in the sky
A fate that we deserve
There's no escape, no
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn

It's been years since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors, ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are awake enough to shatter what we hate
Like broken mirrors, reflections of an unfamiliar face
Hey, hey!

Hey man, you got the time?
Hey, can I trouble you for a light?
Who, me? No, I'm not the old town crier
I'm the one who sets it all on fire
A fate, yeah, that we deserve
And there's no escape, no
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn

We hide from the mirrors
They might show our scars
And there is the person that we want to be
The people we are
Confront your reflection, smash what you see
And let's restart
Because mirrors can't see our heart
