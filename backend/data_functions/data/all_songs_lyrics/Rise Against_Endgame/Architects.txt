Architects Lyrics
Are there no fighters left here anymore?
Are we the generation we've been waiting for?
Or are we patiently burning, waiting to be saved?
Our heroes, our icons, have mellowed with age
Following rules that they once disobeyed
They're now being led when they used to lead the way

Do you still believe in all the things that you stood by before?
Are you out there on the front lines or at home keeping score?
Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate?
Or would you rather be the architect of what we might create?

They laid out the blueprints, they poured down a base
Concrete solutions to slow our decay
And when they are gone who the fuck's gonna take their place?
Yeah, will it be the cynics, the critics galore?
The clich√©, apathetic, passed out on the floor
The trusty complicit who collectively ignore


Don't you remember when you were young?
And you wanted to set the whole world on fire
Somewhere deep down, I know you do
And don't you remember when we were young?
How we wanted to set the world on fire
Because I still am and I still do
Make no mistake, we are not afraid
To bear the burden of repeating of what we're thinking anyway
Let's raise the stakes on the bet we made
Let's decide to be the architects, the masters of our fate

Yeah we still believe in all the things that we stood by before
And after everything we've seen, there may be even more
I know we're not the only ones and we were not the first
And unapologetically we stand behind each word6Embed
