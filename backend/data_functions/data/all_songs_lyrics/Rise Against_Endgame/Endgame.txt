Endgame Lyrics
And on that day they'll tell you
That life hummed on with no clue
The warning signs were all dismissed or shouted down
So it goes
The kings all failed to tell us
The madmen failed to sell us
On what would then befall the only life we'd know
Were they burning signal fires to guide us to the fields?
Or building funeral pyres? The outcome of a final appeal

The city lines are down, the kerosene's run out
The fracturing of all we relied upon
Let's shed this unclean skin and start to feel again
Cause all the shoulders on which to cry are gone

The paranoia gripped us, the rain turned engines to rust
The panic set in like a cancer to our hearts
Spreading through
We bet on finite genius or prayed for gods to save us
But there was no antidote, disease tore us apart
We left bodies in the fields
So numb that we forgot how to feel


He looked at the fields and then his hands
"All I need is what I have"
Then fell a tear of happiness
She watched the world crumble away
"Is this the end of yesterday?"
"Lord, I hope so." is all he said
All gone are the old guards
Gone are the cold, cold wars
Weightless we go forth
On wings of amnesty
Oh, we relied on now

No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
The weight that we once felt is goneEmbed
