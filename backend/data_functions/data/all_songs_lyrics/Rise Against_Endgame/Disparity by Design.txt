Disparity by Design Lyrics
All the way at the bottom of the barrels, we cry out
So ashamed of our tears that we blame only ourselves
That's when they win, they keep us convinced
To lift up our chins, these playing fields are level
"We all have a chance", with that they dismiss
The fast lanes they rode
On which access depends on who you know
Or where you came from
Whose daughter are you? Whose fortunate son?
We're told to stick out our thumbs
They feast from the linens while we settle for crumbs

Is this an over-reaching arm?
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved
Or a just reparation?
(A just reparation)

All the way from the towers, high above glass ceiling tombs
Tell themselves that they've earned this
By working hard and playing by the rules
But this is only part-true
A dangerous trick played on me and you
And so, like a practical joke
We've pulled on these bootstraps so hard that they broke
Is this an over-reaching arm?
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved
Or a just reparation?
And like a single domino
That falls while the rest stay vertical
We're fed these empty fairytales
But will you believe them

And if there's a god, you better pray
That this sleeping giant never wakes

But if we just took a step back
A bigger picture we might view
Perhaps a man in the gutter
Is not so different from you
Come in, out of the cold
Forget all that you know
Because there's always been room by the fire for you
Oh, come in out of the cold
Will you believe them?
Is this an over-reaching arm?
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved
Or a just reparation?
And like a single domino
That falls while the rest stay vertical
We're fed these empty fairytales
And I'm through believing4Embed
