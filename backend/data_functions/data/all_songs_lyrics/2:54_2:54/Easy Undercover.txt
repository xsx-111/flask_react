Easy Undercover LyricsNever meant to start a fire
Tonight
All the words sound the same
They never change
It's easy undercover
Hiding away
You never stay
You never stay
Underneath it's just your away
On and on it never fades
It never fades
It never fades
It never fades
Move closer
The final view
I'll end up leaving
Always do baby
You're nothing new
You're nothing new
Don't forget it's just a moment
You ain't got me you ain't got a clue
Got a clue
Got a clue
Move closer
If yougo you'll never know
Move closerEmbed
