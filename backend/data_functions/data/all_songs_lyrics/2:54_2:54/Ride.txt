Ride LyricsFIRST
SHOULD I FOLLOW YOU THERE
LOST IN A DARK STARE
SHOULD I CHASE IT THERE
HERE
THE RAGGED SAILS TORN
AS THE ROOM COMES UNDONE
YOUR CROOKED HIP
POINTED TONGUE
IT’S ALL A RIDE
TWIST
TO COVER THE SIGHT
ALL LIMBS IN A PLAY-FIGHT
TWITCHING FLICKERING
WAVES
THEY COME EASILY
IT’S IN YOU
IT’S IN ME
SEPARATING SEAMS
IT’S ALL A RIDE
I COULD TURN THE HANDS
I COULD CHANGE IT
I COULD PUT YOU BACK
WHERE I FOUND YOUEmbed
