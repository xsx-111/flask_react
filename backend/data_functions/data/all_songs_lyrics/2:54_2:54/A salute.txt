A salute LyricsSee them rise and see them fall
Around here
With brittle talk giddy salutes
Too cold
Hey did you forget your name?
Hey
Adrift in a strange place
Hand it all to me
Hand it all to me
Borrowed the stories
And you tell them well
Dancing in circles
Repeating the steps
Your heart is a thrown and
Sinking stone
Some like it low
Rich in the dirts
Plit knees
Another sunrise
Another way to cheat
Hey did you forget your name?
Hey
Adrift in a strange place
Hand it all to me
Hand it all to me
Borrowed the stories
And you tell them well
Dancing in circles
Repeating the steps
Your heart is a thrown and
Sinking stone
