Scarlet LyricsCAUGHT INSIDE THE VEINS
SLIDING THROUGH THE GATES
EYES STUNG AND LIPS BURNT
IT FELL
BEND TO MEET THE LOW
DISSOLVE INTO THE DAWN
COARSING AND SOARING
IT FELL
LEADING TO
WHISPERING DISAPPEARING
CANNOT LEAVE A SCAR
LOVER SHE SAID
YOU PUT THE BEAT IN MY BONES
ITS YOUR LIGHT HERE IN MY HAND
YOU MAKE IT EASY TO SEE
IT FLOWS
FLOWS
FLOWS
DELICATE ARROWS
TAKE OVER CONTROL
SOMETHING TO TEMPER THE
BLOW
ONLY SEEING RED
ITS RUSHING THROUGH THE FLESH
PARTED
WAITING FOR THE SWELL
LEADING TO
WHISPERING DISAPPEARING
CANNOT LEAVE A SCAR
LOVER SHE SAID
YOU PUT THE BEAT IN MY BONES
ITS YOUR LIGHT HERE IN MY HAND
YOU MAKE IT EASY TO SEE
IT FLOWS
FLOWS
FLOWS
LOVER SHE SAID
LOVER SHE SAIDEmbed
