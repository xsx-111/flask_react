Sugar LyricsHey stranger what’s your name
Got a feeling we’re the same, same
Where you goin, where have you been
Do you wanna, wanna see
All of it
I wanna see all of it
Push it, push it down
I’m too far above the ground, ground
Above the ground
And now I know, you’re mine, mine
And now I know, you’re mine, mine
And now I know, you’re mine, mine
And now I know, you’re mine, mine
Slip sliding out of you
Need something when I’m next to you, you
Move me, making me move
Some kind of place sounds familiar, territory
Against the best of me
Push it, push it down
In my head you’re hanging around, round
Round
And now I know, you’re mine, mine
And now I know, you’re mine, mine
And now I know, you’re mine, mine
And now I know, you’re mine, mineEmbed
