Creeping LyricsAnd now I wonder where you roam
I've been here a thousand times before
I see it
I see it
I see it
Go
You follow me a shadow
Move me just enough
To pass the time
I see it
I see you
I see you
Follow
So easy
So easy
And now I wonder where you roam
I've been here a thousand times before
Go go go
You pause
I turn
You pull
I part
I can't afford to stop now
You bend
I fall
You walk
I stop
In waves of noise
You send me
Come
Come
Come
Come
You pause
I turn
You follow me a shadow
Move me just enough
To pass the time
I see it
I see you
I see you
Follow
So easy
So easy
And now I wonder where you roam
I've been here a thous
And times before
Go
Go
Go
You pause
I turn
You pull
I part
I can't afford to stop now
You bend
I fall
You walk
I stop
In waves of noise
You send me
Come
Come
Come
ComeEmbed
