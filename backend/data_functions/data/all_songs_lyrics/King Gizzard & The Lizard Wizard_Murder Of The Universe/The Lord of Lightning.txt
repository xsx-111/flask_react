The Lord of Lightning Lyrics
Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in his wake

Lining up his target like the huntsman points his rifle
Waves of flaxen flames as he mutters his magic title

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!
Howling like a horde of demons greatest battle cry
The violent lightning lord points his arms into the sky

Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings
Lord of Lightning moves our way
Sends a crooked look at me
Electricity escapes
Lights the sky in citrine fleece

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!

One more time the vault lights up with carnival of paint
I endeavor to watch the panic, but I worry that I will faint

Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings
Lord of Lightning's closer now
Our world's only rain and cloud
I'm not sure we have the power
Need to smite this evil down

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!
Nonagon, nonagon, oh!

And from the Lord's electric snare
One goes in his electric chair

Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in our wake

His electric trap has electric cyanide
The luckless hostage has been thoroughly fried
Lightning, yup!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yes!
And as the cadaver lay static with open crusted eyes
The smoking corpse began to twitch at my great surprise
Then the figure sprung up and at once it caught alight
And the creature known as Balrog was born that very night9Embed
