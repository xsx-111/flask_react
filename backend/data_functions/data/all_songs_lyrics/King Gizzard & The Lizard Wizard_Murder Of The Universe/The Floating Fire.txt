The Floating Fire Lyrics
Clouds begin to tear
Sky is bleeding hair
God is weeping tears
You are full of fears
Vehement lightning quake
Head begins to ache
Lord has thunder snake
Balrog he will break

And thus, revenge was fruitless, for one who had been turned
And we are reminded who lords over this altered world

Floating fire sky
Everything will die

Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashing
Lord of Lightning safe he
Pulls a golden stake
Launches into space and
Mutters to the beast, one word:

Lightning, yup2Embed
