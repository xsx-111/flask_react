Digital Black Lyrics
Digital, oh!

Despondent, lugubrious, no future
We turned our bodies to computer
We are our own nature, abuser
No future, computer, abuser

I can tell every day I stay
All the whiteness turns to grey
All the grey to Cimmerian
As the black is setting in
Digital black, oh!

We've sunken into our illusion
We've fashioned colossal confusion
I am the word of the last human
Illusion, confusion, last human

I can see it all around the land
I can feel it with the back of my hand
I can hear a roaring silence
Of the murky caliginous
I've heard the dark beast has said
That the world is like a brittle egg
He can crush it with only breath
And he can bring a black wave of death
Digital black
The last who feels the pain from the wound
The last to be birthed from the flesh of a womb
A wretched life in this altered place
There must be more I can embrace

Oh!
No future, computer, abuser
Digital black!
Illusion, confusion, last human
Digit, digit, digit

I can tell every day I stay
All the whiteness turns to grey
All the grey to Cimmerian
As the black is setting in
