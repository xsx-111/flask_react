Life / Death Lyrics
Are you you? Are you me? Or someone in between?
You lost track inside the labyrinthine
You lost your will and your sanity
You certainly lost your humanity
In life, you have taken much more than your worth
Now it's your turn to give back to the earth
May you return to the ground and ossify
It's time for you to die, die, dieEmbed
