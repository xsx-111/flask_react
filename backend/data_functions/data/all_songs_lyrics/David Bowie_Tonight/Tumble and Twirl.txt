Tumble and Twirl Lyrics
I've seen the city
I took the next flight
For Borneo
They say it's pretty
I like the tee shirts
In Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter

(We'll meet in borneo)
I'll reply with a broken spear
(We are *unclear*)
That dusky mulatto
(We'll meet in borneo)
In nylons and tattoos
(I like the free world)
Hot juice in coke bottles
(We'll meet in borneo)
We dance in the sand
(We are *unclear*)
Well, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
(Stereo)
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
(Borneo)
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes
Way down yonder in Borneo

Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle

(We'll meet in borneo)
They laugh and they mumble
(We are *unclear*)
Enjoying the show
(We'll meet in borneo)
And that dusky mulatto
(I like the free world)
Hot juice in coke bottles
(We'll meet in borneo)
In blue jeans and tattoos
(We are *unclear*)
Well, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
I like the free world
(I like the free word)
They say it's pretty
(tumble and twirl)
This time of year
(I like the free word)
They tumble and twirl
(tumble and twirl)
I'll tumble and twirl
