I Keep Forgetting Lyrics
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more

But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door

I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting about those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said

Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more

Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head

I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no moreEmbed
