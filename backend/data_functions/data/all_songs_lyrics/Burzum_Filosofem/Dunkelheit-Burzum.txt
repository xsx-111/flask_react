Dunkelheit/Burzum LyricsWhen night falls
She cloaks the world
In impenetrable darkness
A chill rises
From the soil
And contaminates the air
Suddenly...
Life has new meaning
When night falls
She cloaks the world
In impenetrable darkness
A chill rises from the soil
And contaminates the air
When night falls
She cloaks the world
In impenetrable darkness
A chill rises from the soil
And contaminates the air
Suddenly life has new meaning
Life has new meaning
