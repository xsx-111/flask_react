Decrepitude .I. LyricsTears from the eyes so cold, tears from the eyes, in the grass so green
As I lie here, the burden is being lifted once and for all, once and for all
Beware of the light, it may take you away, to where no evil dwells
It will take you away, for all eternity
Night is so beautiful
We need her as much as we need Day1Embed
