Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament LyricsI wonder how winter will be
With a spring that I shall never see
I wonder how night will be
With a day that I shall never see
I wonder how life will be
With a light I shall never see
I wonder how life will be
With a pain that lasts eternally
In every night there's a different black
In every night I wish that I was back
To the time when I rode
Through the forests of old
In every winter there's a different cold
In every winter I feel so old
So very old as the night
So very old as the dreadful cold
I wonder how life will be
With a death that I shall never see
I wonder why life must be
A life that lasts eternally
I wonder how life will be
With a death that I shall never see
I wonder why life must be
A life that lasts eternally1Embed
