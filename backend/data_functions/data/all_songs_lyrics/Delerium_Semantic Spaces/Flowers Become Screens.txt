Flowers Become Screens LyricsSoaks my skin through to the bone
Pain is nothing that a downpour won't erase
Rain you can't hold on to it
A treasure what you cannot frame
Rain somehow I'm drawn to it
I feel engaged, with one the same
When heaven's dressing beads off my face
Then pain is nothing that a downpour won't erase
Rain, you can't hold on to it
A treasure what you cannot frame
Rain, somehow I'm drawn to it
I feel engaged, one and the same
Rain, rain
Rain, somehow I'm drawn to it
I feel engaged, one and the same
