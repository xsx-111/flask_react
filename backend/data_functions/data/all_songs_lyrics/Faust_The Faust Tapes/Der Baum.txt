Der Baum LyricsSee her sitting on her chair
When she stops kissing I know she won't care
He opened the door, turned on the light and it hurt my eyes
Taking the kids to bed
They're crying so loud they're breaking my head
See her lying on the grass
Must be a nice feeling for her ass
The wind has come
So the leaves, they are gone
Feeling like a tree today
And it's a nice feeling, yeah
The wind has come now
So the leaves, they're gone
Yes leaves are gone
Because the wind has come
See her lying in her bed
Must be a nice feeling for her headEmbed
