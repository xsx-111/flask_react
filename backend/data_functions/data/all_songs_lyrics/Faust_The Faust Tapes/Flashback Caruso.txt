Flashback Caruso LyricsWhen you leave your place
And walk in someone other's garden
Suddenly you see
It's a warming colour in your mind to be
It is only a garden made of sandwich
Marshmallows jumping round and smiling quiet
Inside a stone of cream there is a language
Bring our minds together, press them tight
The rainbow bridge sounds flashbacks of Caruso
Beyond eleven dreams are dancing lights
For everything you feel there is a do so
Your mind it is accepted you are rightEmbed
