It Must Be Hell Lyrics
We've got trouble, that's for sure
We got millions unemployed
Some kids can't write
Some kids can't read
Some kids are hungry
Some overeat
Our TV leader boldly speaks
The words of Christ he tries to preach
We need more power to hold the line
The strength of darkness still abides

Must be hell living in the world
Living in the world like you
Must be hell living in the world
Suffering in the world like you

Keep in a straight line, stay in tune
No need to worry, only fools
End up in prison of conscience cells
Or in asylums they help to build

Must be hell living in the world
Suffering in the world like you you you you
Must be hell living in the world
Suffering in the world like you
Must be hell
Suffering in the world like you
We're free to worship, free to speak
We're free to kill, it's guaranteed
We got our problems, that's for sure
Clean up the backyard, don't lock the door

Must be hell living in the world
Suffering in the world like you
Must be hell living in the world
Suffering in the world like you

I say we, we ain't gonna drown
I say we, we ain't gonna drown
I say we, we are heaven bound
I say we, we are heaven bound
I say we, we are heaven bound
I say we, we are heaven bound
I say we, we are heaven bound
I say we, we are heaven bound
I say we, we are heaven bound
I say we, we are heaven bound
I say we we are heaven boundEmbed
