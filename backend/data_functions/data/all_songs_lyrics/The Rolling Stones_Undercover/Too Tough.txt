Too Tough Lyrics
If you want to wreck my life, go ahead my love
Tried it once with poison, tried it once with drugs
My circulation's running dry, it's you that drank me up
Screwed me down with kindness, suffocating love

When it comes to fighting
Trying to play it rough
I will take you twenty rounds
I'm just too tough, too tough
Too tough, too tough

Saw you on TV last night in a rerun soap
You were young and beautiful, already without hope
But I don't think you ever knew what you've bitten off
But in the end, you spat me out, you could not chew me up
I'm too tough, too tough
Too tough, too tough

When it comes to fighting
Trying to play it rough
I will take you twenty rounds
I'm just too tough, too tough

I was married yesterday to a teenage bride
You said it's only physical but I love her deep inside
I still see you in my dreams with a kitchen knife
With it poised above your head, now who you going to slice?

When it comes to fighting
Trying to play it rough
I will take you twenty rounds
I'm just too tough, too tough
Too tough, too tough

I don't think you'll ever know what you've bitten off
But in the end, you spat me out, you could not chew me up
I was too tough, too tough
Too tough, too tough
Too tough, too tough
Too tough
Too tough, too tough
Too tough, too toughEmbed
