Tie You Up (The Pain of Love) Lyrics
You're deaf to it, blind to it
Been like a thunderclap
Feel the prickles running
Up and down your back
Why so divine, the pain of love?

You have to work at it, stay with it
Pay for it, bust your ass
Lie for it, cheat for it
Forget about your past
Why so divine, the pain of love?

You dream of it passionate
You get a rise from it
Feel the hot cum
Dripping on your thighs from it
Why is that so divine, the pain of love?

Sometimes you crave for it, cry for it
Women will die for it
Looking back, cut the crap
Was it really worth the rap?
It's hard to survive the pain of love
Well, ain't that right?
Yeah, I need a time out
Time to make my mind up
Substitute a line out
I'll be back next season with a bang

No release from the jail
No parole, no bail
Hard labor, fifty lashes
Hard labor, money splashes
Hard to survive the pain of love
Well alright


The old maid is roughed up
Applying the final touches
Even though she's late for the dance
I am telling you tonight she's really goin' have a ball

She's gonna really tie me up
She's gonna really tie me up
She's gonna really tie me up
She's gonna really tie me up
She's gonna really tie me up
She's gonna really tie me up
Yeah, the pains of love
Why they say divine, the pain of love?
Yes (The pain of love)
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
(The pain of love)
Why so divine, yeah, the pain of love?
Yeah, that's what they call it, that's what they call it (The pain of love)
Woo, ready to tie me up (The pain of love)
Tie me up, she got me up, tie me up (The pain of love)
(The pain of love) Don't abuse me
(The pain of love) Don't abuse me
So divine, so divine, the pain of love
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt meEmbed
