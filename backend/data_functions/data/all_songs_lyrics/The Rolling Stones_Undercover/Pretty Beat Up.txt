Pretty Beat Up Lyrics
(Pretty beat up, pretty beat up)
Since you put me down
(Pretty beat up, pretty beat up)
Yeah since you left me lying around
(Pretty beat up, pretty beat up)
Since you eight-sixed me
(Pretty beat up)
You never re-stitched me
(Pretty beat up)
My face is a mess (Pretty beat up)
Yeah yeah, you ought to see my face
(Pretty beat up, pretty beat up)
Yeah, it's a mess (Pretty beat up, pretty beat up)
You ought to see inside, in my heart
(Pretty beat up, pretty beat up)

I'm marked for life (Pretty beat up)
I'm marked for life, pretty beat up
Pretty beat up, pretty beat up
Pretty beat up

(Pretty beat up, pretty beat up)
(Pretty beat up, pretty beat up)
Yeah, that's right baby
(Pretty beat up)
(Pretty beat up)
(Pretty beat up, pretty beat up)
Yeah I'm just like a battered baby
Just left on the street (Pretty beat up)
You ought to see the state (Pretty beat up)
I've been cut with a razor (Pretty beat up, pretty beat up)

Don't you cut me up, don't you cut me up
Don't you cut me up, yeah baby
(Pretty beat up)
(Pretty beat up)
(Pretty beat up)
(Pretty beat up)Embed
