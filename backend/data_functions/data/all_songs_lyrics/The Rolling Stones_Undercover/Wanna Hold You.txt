Wanna Hold You Lyrics
I wanna hold
I got to hold you
Hold you, baby, close to me

I hope you find it funny
That I got no money
But if you stick with me
You're going to get some love for free

Oh, I wanna hold you
I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me
Close to me
Yeah, I got to hold you
I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me, yeah

You sure look good to me
So what's it gonna be?
It's up to you to choose
I'll make an offer you can't refuse
Oh, I got to hold you
Yeah, I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me, yeah yeah
Oh, I got to hold you
Uh, I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me

This time it's not for fun
That you're the only one
What should I say to you?
I only know that this love's gonna do

I got to hold you
I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me
I want to hold you
I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me

But if you let me smile
But if you know I lie
But after all you gave
I'll be your lover, I'll be your slave
I got to hold you, yeah
Yeah, I wanna hold you
Hold you baby, close to me
I got to hold you
I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I got to hold you
Yeah, I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me
I got to hold you
I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I wanna hold you
I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I got to hold you
I got to hold you
Hold you baby, close to me
Oh yeah, oh yeahEmbed
