Destroy Rock & Roll LyricsAll perversions of the third eye
Through distorted and exaggerated images
Perverted movements of the body and breakdancing
And other forms of dancing
And we especially call for the judgement in this hour
And the destroying of rock music directed
Specifically against children
Through the videos that were portrayed
And working specifically through these individuals
For whom we call for
The judgement of the sacred fire of this hour
Before the throne of almighty god
