Sunworshipper Lyrics
Well, this'd solve all my problems
To get out of drugs, I'd, I'd had enough of that
I'd had the college, I'd had the
Earning the money and the material trip
I just decided I was gonna find a new way of life
And so I took off on my bicycle
Well, this'd solve all my problems
To get out of drugs, I'd, I'd had enough of that
I'd had the college, I'd had the
Earning the money and the material trip
I just decided I was gonna find a new way of life
And so I took off on my bicycle
Well, this'd solve all my problems
To get out of drugs, I'd, I'd had enough of that
I'd had the college, I'd had the
Earning the money and the material trip
I just decided I was gonna find a new way of life
And so I took off on my bicycle


Well, this'd solve all my problems
To get out of drugs, I'd, I'd had enough of that
I'd had the college, I'd had the
Earning the money and the material trip
I just decided I was gonna find a new way of life
And so I took off on my bicycle

Well, this'd solve all my problems
To get out of drugs, I'd, I'd had enough of that
I'd had the college, I'd had the
Earning the money and the material trip
I just decided I was gonna find a new way of life
And so I took off on my bicycle
Pedalling up Highway 1
And found myself one day in Eureka, CaliforniaEmbed
