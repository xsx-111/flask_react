I Think I Like It Lyrics
Something changing for me inside
Took a long time
Now there's nothing for me to hide
I say what's on my mind
Changes, making me see the light
I finally see wrong from right
Now I can see every sign

Oooh, I think I like it
I think I like what I'm feeling
Even though it's such a surprise
But you know
Oooh, I think I really like it
I think I like what I feel
And changes really open your eyes

Oh, look at the world we make
What have we begun?
People livin' for what they take
All for number one
Changes makin' me see the light
I finally see the light
I finally see wrong from right
Now that it's all said and done

Oh doesn't love say enough
When you realize?
People try to come on so tough
All to fantasize
Changes takin' me through the night
I finally see the light
I've opened my eyes
Those changes can open you eyesEmbed
