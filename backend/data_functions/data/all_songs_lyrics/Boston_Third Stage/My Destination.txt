My Destination Lyrics
And
Feeling the way I do
Wouldn't last a mile without you
When I'm losing the way, the things that you say
Take me there
My destination
My destination
Is by your side
Right by your side
And I
I've taken so long, I know
Never had so far to go
It's not where you can be, it's what you can see
That takes you there
Your destination
Your destination
It's here inside, right here insideEmbed
