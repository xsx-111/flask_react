Hollyann Lyrics
In my mind
I can see reminders of a past decay
So far behind
Like the shadows linger at the close of day
And we could see
We were timeless dreamers of another day
And we were free
In a dawning age we had so much to say
Oooh, the nights you came to me
A bluejean lady so eager to be free
And the wind in your long hair blowing as we stood for the band
Oh, Hollyann

Hollyann
We made the dark into light
We saw the wrong and the right
We were for life
And we would never concede it
Hollyann
We left the world behind
A million hands gave the sign
We held the line
Can you believe it?
Hollyann
Hollyann
We could live
Just to turn the world into our fantasy
And we could give
Aquarius was really meant to be
You and I we were there to see the dawn
Side by side we had love to carry on
And I still hear guitars in the air as we sat in the sand
Oh, Hollyann
