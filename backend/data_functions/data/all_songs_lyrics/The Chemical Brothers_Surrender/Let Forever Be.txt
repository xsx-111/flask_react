Let Forever Be Lyrics
And how does it feel like
To wake up in the sun?
And how does it feel like
To shine on everyone?
And how does it feel like
To let forever be?
And how does it feel like
To spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?

Scream a symphony

And how does it feel like
To sail in on the breeze?
And how does it feel like
To spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?

Scream a symphony

And how does it feel like
To make it happening?
And how does it feel like
To breathe with everything?
And how does it feel like
To let forever be?
And how does it feel like
To spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?
Scream a symphony

And how does it feel like
To be a crystalline?
And how does it feel like
To spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?

Scream a symphonyEmbed
