THE GHOST OF RANKING DREAD! Lyrics
Once you start seeing me training and grinding, you gon' fuckin' go bitch
Everything about JPEGs I like

Ain't nothing wrong with the two of us
Know that
Put it down just like you miss me
Know that
Ain't nothing wrong with the two of us
Know that
Miss me
Know that

Uh, oh, I got **** baby momma in the back seat
This other **** baby mama won't stop harrassin' me
I can't keep up with these girls
I just want quiet and peace
There's more than dick in this world
Bitch, take me back to the streets
Gotta keep sonning you, fuck every one of you
I got the gun in a T (For real)
She said I'm done with you, I had my fun with you
Take me back to the streets
Watch your tone when you talk to this geek
Choppa don't jam, it's like one of y'all beats
Stay in the lab, get the fuck out the streets
This is not what you want
This is not where you at
This not it
I finesse and I jugg in that bitch
Give it back, I ain't through with that shit
Can't do shit on your own, don't you need the assist?
Attack of the Clones when these niggas be spittin'
Off-beat shit ain't gon' make you a livin'
Teach you somethin' since you think that I'm kiddin'
Woke, third-eye rappin' ass niggas
NOI flows, with pork for an image
Woah, call up the minister, something just ain't addin' up
But lions and leopards ain't meant to be jiggy
Tyrone Hill, this ain't meant to be pretty
Niggas named after baking soda, but he never touched no fuckin' coke in your city
She's so thick, hit that bitch with a fast ball
Know you wanna fuck for my image
Heard your tape, glad I didn't get a mention
Last year bitch, I beat a sentence
That's why these hoes just want the attention
Stop talking
I see you blur your face for the 'Gram
I blur your face for forensics
With this DAW bitch, I'm Jimi Hendrix
With this thot shit I'm Eddie Henâ€”
Wait, Kendricks, man2Embed
