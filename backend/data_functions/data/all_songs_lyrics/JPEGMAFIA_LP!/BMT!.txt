BMT! Lyrics
Uh, back in this bitch with a C in the case
All in the 'Gram, but don't be in my face
Gotta keep goin', I see why you hate
You know how I do it, I see what you make
Just stop it, wait
How I got these niggas runnin' in place
Mute Spittah when that gun in your face
Packin' the MAC in the back of the gate
Everything you hear, I actually made
You witty on Twitter, but bitch, is you actually paid? (Nope)
Your bodyguards can't keep you safe
I tell the wolves I don't need no plate

Fuck my sergeants, fuck your base
Fuck that harness, fuck them planes
Fuck your music, fuck them chains
Fuck your videos, fuck your face
Everything that y'all do is fake
Everything that I do get hate
I tell the wolves I don't need no plate
My bulldogs gon' eat your face
Yeah, that shit don't make me feel no type of way (Nah)
All in yo' city get no type of hate, none
All them threats sound fake, A
Niggas get shot everyday, B
I can't peek your face, C
This price, make him pay (Rap)
I just want the hate (The hate)
I just want your place (Place)
I gave it up to God (Okay)
And God gave me this K
Make it shake, wait
I'm tired of dodging fate (I can't)
It's so many niggas I hate (I hate)
It's so many these niggas I can't (I can't)
I can't
(Fuck 'em, huh, uh)
Uh, back in this bitch with a C in the case
All in the 'Gram, but don't be in my face
Gotta keep goin', I see why you hate
You know how I do it, I see what you make
Just stop it, wait
How I got these niggas runnin' in place
Mute Spittah when that gun in your face
Packin' the MAC in the back of the gate (Uh, uh)
Everything you hear, I actually made
You witty on Twitter, but bitch, is you actually paid? (Uh, uh)
No bodyguards can keep you safe
I tell the wolves, I don't need no plate6Embed
