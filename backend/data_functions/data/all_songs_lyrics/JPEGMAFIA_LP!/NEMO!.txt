NEMO! Lyrics
You think you know me
Hm
Hm

Downtown shawty, poke your ass out
I only set niggas up, I don't back down
Black Ms rollin' 'round with that K out
Every time I look down, I'm clean
Yeah, got it on me
Big Gat', bail bonds and wrist slap
Lets see you niggas try to doge all this new tech

Buck, buck, buck, buck
Fuckin' your bitch like I'm back from the war (Ay)
Fuckin' your bitch, when I'm goin' on tour
Fucked in the head at my best I want gore
In the ocean like Nemo, those sharks hit the floor
We can't relate, bitch, I was poor
Empty the safe, money on floor (Ding)

All of my songs a diss (Facts)
I might just ghostwrite a hit
They know that's money well-spent, yeah, yeah (You fixed your pussy?)
Hol' up, fuck, nigga did huh with what?
You gon' keep pushin' your luck
If I aim for your head, better hope that you duck
Buck, brrt, buck, buck, buck
Fuckin' that bitch like I'm back from the war (Yeah)
Fuckin' your bitch like I'm back from the tour (Uh)
Fuck on me, baby, you know I'm a whore
I pistol whip 'em so he know that it's war
I ain't even have to show up in court
Droppin' the case, got her droppin' her jaw, shit


Buck, brrt
Fuckin' that bitch like I'm goin' to war
Fuckin' that bitch like I'm back from the tour (Hahaha)
**** on me, baby, you know that he borin'
I feel like A.I., ain't no win, I'm just scorin', huh
I can afford it (Yeah)
In the ocean like Dory, these sharks get 'em sorted, nasty
