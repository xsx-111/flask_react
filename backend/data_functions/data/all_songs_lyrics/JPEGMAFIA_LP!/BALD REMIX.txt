BALD REMIX Lyrics
Yeah
Fuck that, whoa, uh

Fuck that bitch, I changed the plan
Switch my style like I switch hands
Block the witness, take the stand
Fuck out the way bitch, back it up
Shit better get played in a palace (Word)
I can't treat niggas like big deals
Why put up a front? I’m callous
Bald (Ha)
I look like Ray Allen (Real)
These niggas make beats on big wheels
Yo' files is not a challenge (Nah)
Boy, you can't rap for shit
Shuttlesworth blessed me with talent
Hairline proof God needs balance
Bald

Yeah
My life was written already, so I was gifted already
And with this God-given talent, I knew the Devil been met me
Can't compare me to Jesus, because he ain't know his father
He told me, "Please, be still and see that steel is revolver" (You right)
'Cause in my hood, these niggas poppin' mollies and shootin'
I'm stressed the fuck out, that's why I must commence to get zooted
I'm trapped in my head, between the thoughts of health and my wealth
Right next to bein' selfish and just bein' myself
The fast spitter, slash cash-getter, bad sinner, sipping bad liquor
It's the nigga you may know, I'm the GOAT
To them clout chasers and them 'bout whatevers and them wave riders
Told them that my life is not a boat, you can't float (You right)
Call me Zeltron when I'm rappin', call me Denzel when we fuck, ho
You're allowed to touch me, but I don't wanna keep in touch, though (Wow)
Say I'm livin' comfortable, because I'm makin' much dough
But I wasn't happy, cut my hair and let the sluts go
Ever so softly, suicide has crossed me
Did I lose my mind? I feel my head been lost me
Been a couple years and haven't spoken to Lofty
Haven't seen the family, only been with the posse (Skrr)
Couple gold plaques, scratch that off a goal list
Cold shit is gettin' diamond plaques by stayin' focused (Yuh)
No whip, I won't let 'em do me like Jahseh (Yuh)
My mama say that I should pray, 'cause demon comes in different shapes (Okay)
Got that Stray Rats on my body, 'cause Maurice don't fuck with BAPE (What?)
All these bars that I be writin', make it hard for you to relate (Damn)
Hesitate, I rarely do when fuckin' these hoes I barely knew
Overturnin', startin' new, can't act like a jit by thirty-two
I'm twenty-five, though, dreadlocks had your boy like Sideshow Bob
Can't complain about too much, because I'm on my job
Switch my look, I got 'em hooked, they call me Young Heartthrob
I am (Bald!)17Embed
