TRUST! Lyrics
You think you know me
I won't even fib
Uh

These hoes is conniving (Woah), I won't even try them (Woah)
I won't even lie, I'm looking good
I won't even fib, I'm feeling nice
I'm looking good today, I bought a new suit
I'm 'bout to go to work (Okay) and praise God (What else?)
I feel like celebrating, I ain't been fucked up
Yeah, I been fucked over, still going hard (Still going hard)
I feel like celebrating, okay, I'm fucked up
Yeah, I've been fucked over, still feeling nice (Still get it in)

Everything's great (Everything's great)
Everything's cool (Everything's cool)
Everything's perfect (Everything's perfect)
Everything's good (Everything's good)
Everything's kosher (Everything's kosher, baby)

I can't believe that shit (Cannot), I don't believe that bitch (No way)
I don't believe these niggas, bruh, they be lyin'
These hoes is conniving, I won't even try to (Uh-huh)
I won't even lie (Uh-huh), I'm looking good
I won't even fib, I'm feeling nice (Facts)
These hoes is conniving (Woah), I won't even try to (Woah)
I won't even lie (Ayy), I'm looking good
I won't even fib, I'm feeling nice, uh

Uh
These hoes is conniving (Woah), I won't even try to (Woah)
Even if I did, I wouldn't put it in no rhyming (Uh-huh)
I ain't chasing plaques, I ain't even running (Nope)
Baby, I'm a soldier; I get medals when I'm gunnin' (Boom, boom, boom)
They lookin' like, "Peggy, let's see some receipts"
Everything I say I do gon' get did
I don't talk trash (Nah), I don't say nothin' (Nah)
I just speak facts (Facts), niggas be bluffin' (Yup)
I won't even lie, I'm looking good
I won't even fib, I'm feeling nice
