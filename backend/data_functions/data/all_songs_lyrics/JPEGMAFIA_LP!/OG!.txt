OG! Lyrics
Yes, but you are the hip-hop gangster
To switch around the answer bring it right to the top (Woah)
Sir Vicious Just Ice, the gangster of hip-hop
To switch around the answer bring it right to the top (Woah)
Sir Vicious Just Ice, the gangster of hip-hop
To switch around the answer bring it right to the top
Sir Vicious Just Ice, the gangster of hip-hop
I use a rhyme for a gun, the truth to tell
You can ask B.I., my brother Shamel
Comin' straight from Brooklyn where the warriors dwell
Comin' straight from Brooklyn where the warriors dwell

Uh, I gotta have it (Have it), it's not a habit (Habit)
I feel like a bad bitch, I smack it up (Smack it)
It's a closed casket (Uh-huh), this flow's mastered
I'm a whole has-been, I know it's tough (I know it's tough)
Was spittin' off-beat in my old spot (Old spot)
How you gon' tell me I ain't poppin'? Baby, you're not (Not at all)
Finna take that praise back (Yeah, yeah)
Finna take the game back (Yeah, yeah)
And I'm still spittin' in their mouth, I know you hate that
Better put that money down, better store that cash and tree
Better make it work just like they been workin' me (Just Ice)
And when this album over, work for nobody for free (Just Ice)
And when this album over, work for nobody but me (Just Ice)
So for all you rasclaat just lick the street
Yes, but you are the hip-hop gangster
To switch around the answer bring it right to the top
Sir Vicious Just Ice, the gangster of hip-hop
To switch around the answer bring it right to the top
Sir Vicious Just Ice, the gangster of hip-hop
To switch around the answer bring it right to the top
Sir Vicious Just Ice, the gangster of hip-hop
I use a rhyme for a gun, the truth to tell
You can ask B.I., my brother Shamel
Comin' straight from Brooklyn where the warriors dwell
Comin' straight from Brooklyn where the warriors dwell
