END CREDITS! Lyrics
You pull up to a red light
A man jerks your door open, says
"Out of the car, I'm taking your car"
You say, "Okay, take it, just don't hurt me"
You know what I do?
I pull out the Glock, put it on his forehead
And spill his brains all over the concrete
You think you know me

Uh, bitch, I write a scene on your life
And I only rap out of spite
Loss is the theme of my life
After the steam and the hype, dawg

This is my career, not a dice
Never take L's to a light
Bitch, I am impervious to type
So young, bucking at advice
New Glock, leave it up to Christ (Hahaha)
Uh, fit for a Joker, need a Harley
Don Callis never been a carny
And you know we showin' out for Darby
Me and Tina bucking back at Ike
You a diva, we gon' drop the mic
New Glock, leave it up to Christ (Ah)
Uh, why would I show you my hand?
I put on a show on demand
I was on the show, who a fan?
These boys never made a profit
You ain't doin' shit, nigga, stop it
I see who y'all biggin', but it's gas
Grown men co-sign trash
Log off, go find bags
Two Glocks tucked in a bag
New switches, they gon' get attached
And they said we never gonna last
Death loop, you ain't comin' back
Them tweets cost you a life
You ain't had a hand in the hype
(Nah, man)
Uh, bitch, I'll write a scene on your life
And I only rap out of spite
Loss is the theme of my life
After the steam and the hype, dawg

I'm Arn Anderson5Embed
