Misfit Love Lyrics
Wanna see my past in flames
Don't waste a drop, baby, I ain't fussed
Where I was born, no escape
There there ain't even no good bad drugs
In the city, is it true?
If you don't, you act like you do
Feast of fools, I can't wait
Give 'em a taste of my misfit love
Complicate, incarcerate
Feel my heart break up

Ain't born to lose, baby
I'm born to win
I'm so goddamn sick, baby it's a sin (It's a sin)
Transforming is becoming
(I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill)
Transforming is becoming of me
(I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill)
(I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill)
(I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill)

Do me first, do your worst
Gimme what I want some of
One-track mind, no time to waste
Sidewalks, feel me strut so good
Gutter, don't forget this face
Let 'em taste my misfit love
I'll show you all my dirty tricks
Then show 'em again I'm so proud of 'em
It's cruel to be constantly
Feel my heart play dumb
Ain't born to lose, baby
I'm born to win
I'm so sick, baby, it's a sin (It's a sin)

Just a dead man, walking through the dead of night
And if you're going anywhere tonight
Just a dead end walking through the dead of night
And if you are going, can I get a ride?
Just a dead man walking through the dead of night
It's impossible to wait until the light
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won2Embed
