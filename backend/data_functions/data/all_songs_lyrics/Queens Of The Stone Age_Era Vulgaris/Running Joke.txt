Running Joke Lyrics
When I was a little boy
I looked under the stairs
The king and the pawns
Were caught unawares
Standing in the shadows
A whisperer to be
Just fishing in the darkness
Of possibilities

Just
Look
At you now
Yeah
Look at you now
Yeah
Oh
Look at you now

Among such style and grace
Our highest hopes
None standing still
The running joke
Where goes the warm embrace it fades
Without return
That lives to slip through fingertips and burn
Just
Look
At you now
Oh
Look at you now
Oh
Look at you now
Oh
Look at you nowEmbed
