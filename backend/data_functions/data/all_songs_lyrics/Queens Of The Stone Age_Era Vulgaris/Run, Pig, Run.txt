Run, Pig, Run Lyrics
When I was young
We used to play the game of hide & seek
Someone go hide, I count to ten
You probably never played
Instead you talk a game of sheep
A skill you almost do perfect

Run, Pig, Run
Here, I, Come

I am no saint & make no claims
To being in the right
Its just for now, I am wrong-less
You probably wondering
With what to do, this has with you
I wanna play the game you missed

Run, Pig, Run
Here, I , Come

There is no safe place
There is no safe place
There is no safe place to hide2Embed
