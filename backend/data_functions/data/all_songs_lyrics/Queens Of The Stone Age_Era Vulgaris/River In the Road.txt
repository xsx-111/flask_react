River In the Road Lyrics
A fast approaching monster, marching in a row
Grab what slips your mind and what your memory won't hold
Run, darling, run
I'll stall them if I can
You'll escape and I'll be left rotting on the vine

Yeah, uh-uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, uh-uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Run, darling, run
I'll stall if I can
You'll escape and I'll be left rotting on the vine
Avert the children's eyes
Forgets left untold
Don't look back to see the blood
River in the road

Yeah, uh-uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, uh-uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Get sweet revenge with my blood
A river in the road1Embed
