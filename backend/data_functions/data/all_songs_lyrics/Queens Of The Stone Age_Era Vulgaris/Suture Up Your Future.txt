Suture Up Your Future Lyrics
I'm gonna suture up my future
I ain't jaded, I just hate it
See, I've been down too long
It's kinda hard to explain
Done and buried all I carried
All my evil's through a needle
As it pull through the eye
What was and will are now gone

Don't sweat it
Thread it, to forget it
To feel like you've already gone on
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got
Take a picture and bury it all away
Bury it all away

Tried to fake it, I just can't take it
I don't care if it hurts
Just so long as it's real
I won't waste it, turned to face it
I'd sharpened a knife, then used it till bone made it dull
Tried explaining, done explaining
I got caught in the plaid
Of all this talking at once
I've been giving my love away
To the things that tear it apart
I'm gonna suture up my future
Thread it, to forget it
To feel like you've already gone on
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got
Tie the loose ends and bury it all away
It's like this, just like this6Embed
