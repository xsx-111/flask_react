Simple Pages Lyrics
Give me some love, give me some love
Give me some, I want you to know
Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar, that's the wrong, wrong way to go
Open your arms, open your arms
Honey, you come right back home to me
Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar, that's the wrong, wrong way to be

Can't you see?
We're to be this time
Simple pages on my mind

Kick it on back, kick it on back
Kick it on back to what you know
Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar on the hard rock radio
Where they play tunes, where they play tunes
Where they play riffs with the hard rock beat
Give me some love, give me some love, sugar
From the drop with the old school meet

Can't you see?
We're to be this time
Simple pages on my mind
Give me something I can believe, oh baby

Can't you see?
We're to be this time
Simple pages on my mind

Kick it on back, kick it on back
Kick it on back to what you know
Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar on the hard rock radio
So give me some love, give me some love
(Give me some love, give me some love
Give me some, I want you to know)
Give me some love, give me some love
(Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar on the hard rock radio)
Give me some
(Give me some love, give me some love
Give me some, I want you to know)
Can't you see?
You're just me
(Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar, that's the wrong, wrong way to go)
Turn these pages of my mind, oh, oh
(Give me some love, give me some love
Give me some, I want you to know)
Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar, that's the wrong, wrong way to goEmbed
