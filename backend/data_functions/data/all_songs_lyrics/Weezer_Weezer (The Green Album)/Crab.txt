Crab Lyrics
Crab if you want her
She won't be coming down (down)
Down (down)
Down (down)
Down (down)
Crab if you want her
She won't be coming down

Crab if you need it
She put her knickers on (on)
On (on)
On (on)
On (on)
Crab if you need it
She put her knickers on

She said she's feeling lonely
And I say that's OK
She won't be comin' back 'round here, no way

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She said she's feeling lonely
And I say that's OK
She won't be comin' back 'round here, no way

Crab at the booty
T'ain't gonna do no good (good)
Good (good)
Good (good)
Good (good)
Crab at the booty
T'ain't gonna do no good

No, crab at the booty
T'ain't gonna do no good3Embed
