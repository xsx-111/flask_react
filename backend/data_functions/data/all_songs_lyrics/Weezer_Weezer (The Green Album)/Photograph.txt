Photograph Lyrics
If you want it, you can have it
But you've got to learn to reach out there and grab it

'Cause everybody wants some love (oh, baby)
Shooting from the stars above (oh, baby)
And though my heart will break, there's more that I could take
I could never get enough

If you need it, you should show it
Because you might play so monastic that you blow it

'Cause everybody wants some hope (oh, baby)
Something they can barely know (oh, baby)
And though my heart will break, there's more that I could take
I could never let it go

It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph of love

'Cause everybody wants a dream (oh, baby)
Something they can barely see (oh, baby)
And though my heart will break, there's more that I could take
I could never let it be

It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph of love

If you blew it, don't reject it
Just sit, drawing up the plans and re-erect it
Just sit, drawing up the plans and re-erect it
Just sit, drawing up the plans and re-erect it1Embed
