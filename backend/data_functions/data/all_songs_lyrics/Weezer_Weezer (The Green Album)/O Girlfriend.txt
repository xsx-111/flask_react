O Girlfriend Lyrics
I miss you
And I wonder how you feel about me too
Do you miss the way we would play
And waste our time away?
Suddenly, we're apart
And I can't see you every night
Though we'd fight I loved you so much
Now, I can't feel your touch

Oh, girlfriend
That's the end
And I'm lost without your love
Oh, love

In your arms
I was happy as a little boy could be
Taking pills and mellowing out
Now, I just want to shout
For your love
'Cause I'm drifting further from you every day
Driving by your place every night
I used to feel alright
Oh, girlfriend
That's the end
And I'm lost without your love
Oh, love

Feeling fancies every night
When I dreamed to be alright
Oh, love
Oh, love

Oh, girlfriend
That's the end
And I'm lost without your love
Oh, love

In your arms
I was happy as a little boy could be
Taking pills and mellowing out
Now, I just want to shout
Now, I just want to shout
Now, I just want to shout1Embed
