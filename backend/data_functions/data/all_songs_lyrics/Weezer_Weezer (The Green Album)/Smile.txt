Smile Lyrics
Open the door and let your love come down
Over the wall, you're spinning 'round and 'round
Because you wanted some love
I'll make it happen

'Cause I don't want to break
Your fine face, I can't take
The way you want to wrap me up
Inside your smile

Open your heart and let the good stuff out
Water me girl and let me ease the drought
Because you wanted some love
I'll make it happen

'Cause I don't want to break
Your fine face, I can't take
The way you want to wrap me up
Inside your smile

I can't be gone, darling
For very long, no
Never know what you're going to do
Standing there deep in front of you
Take a look in between my eyes
Because I'm back, yeah
'Cause I don't want to break
Your fine face, I can't take
The way you want to wrap me up
Inside your smile

I can't be gone, darling
For very long, no
Never know what you're going to do
Standing there deep in front of you
Take a look in between my eyes
Because I'm back, yeah

Give me a chance if you can force yourself
Look at me girl and get up off your shelf
Because you wanted some love
I'll make it happenEmbed
