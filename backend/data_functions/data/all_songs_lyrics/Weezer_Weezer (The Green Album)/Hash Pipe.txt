Hash Pipe Lyrics
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
These players come to get me cause they'd like my behind
I can't love my business if I can't get a trick
Down on Santa Monica where tricks are for kids

Oh, come on and kick me
Oh, come on and kick me
(Woah) Come on and kick me
(Woah) You've got your problems
(Woah) I've got my asswipe
(Oh) You've got your big G's
I've got my hash pipe

I can't help my boogies, they get out of control
I know that you don't care but I want you to know
The knee-stocking flavor is a favorite treat
Of men that don't bother with the taste of a teat

Oh, come on and kick me
Oh, come on and kick me
(Whoa) Come on and kick me
(Woah) You've got your problems
(Oh) I've got my asswipe
(Oh) You've got your big G's
I've got my hash pipe
I've got my hash pipe

Oh, come on and kick me
Oh, come on and kick me
(Oh) Come on and kick me
(Oh) You've got your problems
(Oh) I've got my asswipe
(Oh) You've got your big G's
I've got my hash pipe
I got my hash pipe
I got my hash pipe
I got my hash pipe5Embed
