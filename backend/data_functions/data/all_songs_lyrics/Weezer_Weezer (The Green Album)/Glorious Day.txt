Glorious Day Lyrics
Gonna make my move
Gonna make it stay
Gonna make it last
Never mind the past
Living for today

Hey, hey, hey
You know what you want me to say
Right, right
Fight, fight
We could start a glorious day

Gonna take my chance
Gonna rock and dance
Gonna hit the ground
With a brand new sound
Looking for romance

Hey, hey, hey
You know what you want me to say
Right, right
Fight, fight
We could start a glorious day
Glorious children on my mind
Glorious wastings of my time
Glorious plans we make up
Forcing things in line

Hey, hey, hey
You know what you want me to say
Right, right
Fight, fight
We could start a glorious day

Glorious children on my mind
Glorious wastings of my time
Glorious plans we make up
Forcing things in line

Gonna rock it out
Gonna scream and shout
Gonna do it right
Standing in the light
Flexing all our clout
Gonna do it right
Standing in the light
Flexing all our clout
Gonna do it right
Standing in the light
Flexing all our clout1Embed
