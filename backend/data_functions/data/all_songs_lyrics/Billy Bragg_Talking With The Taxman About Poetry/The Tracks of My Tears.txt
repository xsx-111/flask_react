The Tracks of My Tears LyricsPeople say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears, I need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute she's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent on&101
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears, I need you
Hey, hey, yeah
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
I'm just a clown, yeah, oh, since you put me down
My smile is my make up I wear since my break up with you
Baby, take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Baby, baby, baby, baby, take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tearsEmbed
