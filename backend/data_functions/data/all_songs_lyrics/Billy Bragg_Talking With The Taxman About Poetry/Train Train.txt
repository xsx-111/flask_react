Train Train LyricsTrain took my baby away from me
Tears in my eyes, I could not see
Oh train train
Hurry bring my baby back again
I love that woman, you just don't know
And now that she's gone I'll miss her so
Why train train
Hurry bring my baby back again
Then I got this letter she wrote to me
Says she's coming home, in my misery
Why train train
Hurry bring my baby back againEmbed
