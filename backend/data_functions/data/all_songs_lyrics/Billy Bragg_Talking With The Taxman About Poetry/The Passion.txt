The Passion LyricsThe fear of a daughter can run high
In the mind of a father to be
For something is growing inside
But we don't talk about it, do we?
In the long empty passionless night
Many times to herself she has prayed
That the baby will love her much more
Than the big boy who stole her away
And sometimes it takes a grown man a long time to learn
Just what it would take a child a night to learn
And sometimes it takes a grown man a long time to learn
Just what it would take a child a night to learn
It pains her to know that some things will never be right
If the baby is just someone else to take sides in a fight
Harsh words between bride and groom
The distance is greater each day
He smokes alone in the next room
And she knits her life away
And sometimes it takes a grown man a long time to learn
Just what it would take a child a night to learn
And sometimes it takes a grown man a long time to learn
Just what it would take a child a night to learn
A long time ago she saw visions on the stairs
And when she felt dizzy, her mother was always there
The home help is no help at all
I have not committed a crime
Angels gaze down from the wall
Is there a God? Is there a next time?Embed
