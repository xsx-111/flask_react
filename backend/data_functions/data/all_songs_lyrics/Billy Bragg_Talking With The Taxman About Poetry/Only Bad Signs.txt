Only Bad Signs LyricsHe answers the phone
So I know you're not alone
I'll find only bad signs
If you've let him answer this time
When I return
To find letters that you've burnt
I'll find only bad signs
If you have burnt his, not mine
When you go out, I do not doubt
That I'll find only bad signs
By things that you leave here
I'd rather go blind
Than continue to find
Only bad signs
You know that you're leaving
I cannot guess
How much more I can take
When you're with him
Three's a crowd, and a heartbreak
The look on your face
And the long silent days
I see only bad signs
If we are lost in our own home
The sun may rise
But not in my eyes
I see only bad signs
And sorrow and shadows
I just cannot guess
How much more I can take
When you're with him
Three's a crowd, and a heartbreak
He answers the phone
So I know you're not alone
I'll find only bad signs
If you've let him answer this time
When I return
To find letters that you've burnt
I'll find only bad signs
If you have burnt his, not mine
Only bad signs
Only bad signs
Only bad signsEmbed
