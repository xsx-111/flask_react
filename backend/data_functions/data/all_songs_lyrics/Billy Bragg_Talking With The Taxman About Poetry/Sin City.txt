Sin City LyricsThis old town is filled with sin, it will swallow you in
If you've got some money to burn, take it home right away
You've got three years to pay, but Satan is waiting his turn
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty first floor, a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burnin' rain
The scientists say, it will all wash away
But we don't believe any more, so we got our recruits
And our green Mohair suits, so please show your I.D. at the doo&114
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty first floor, a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burnin' rain
A friend came around, tried to clean up this town
And his ideas made some people mad
But he trusted his crowd, so he spoke right out loud
And they lost the best friend they had
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty first floor, a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burnin' rain
On the thirty first floor, a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burnin' rainEmbed
