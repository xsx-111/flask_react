Hold the Fort LyricsWe meet to die in freedoms cause
And raise our voices high
We'll join our hands in union strong
To battle or to die
Hold the fort
For we are coming
Union men be strong
Side by side keep pressing onward
Victory will come
Look my comrades
See the union banner waving high
Reinforcements now appearing
Victory is nigh
Hold the fort
For we are coming
Union men be strong
Side by side keep pressing onward
Victory will come
See our numbers still increasing
Hear the bugles blow
By our union we shall triumph
Over every foe
Hold the fort
For we are coming
Union men be strong
Side by side keep pressing onward
Victory will come
Fierce and long, the battle rages
But we do not fear
Help will come whenever it's needed
Cheer my comrades cheer
Hold the fort
For we are coming
Union men be strong
Side by side keep pressing onward
Victory will comeEmbed
