Do It Again Lyrics
It's automatic when I
Talk with old friends
The conversation
Turns to girls we knew
When their hair was soft and long
And the beach was the place to go

With suntanned bodies
And waves of sunshine
The California girls
And a beautiful coastline
And warmed-up weather
Let's get together and do it again

Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Dum-dee-doo-ron
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
With a girl, the lonely sea looks good
With moonlight
Makes your night times warm
And out of sight (Been so long)

Do, do, do-do-do (Been so long)
Do, do, do-do-do (So long, been so long)
Been so long
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now

Well I've been thinking
'Bout all the places
We've surfed and danced
And all the faces
We've missed, so let's get
Back together and do it again
(Come on and do it)

Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Dum-dee-doo-ron
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-doâ€¦Embed
