Be with Me Lyrics
You're going out tonight
You put your real cool-looking clothes on
You're getting uptight
About some little thing I said
All that I said
"I couldn't play the game"
It shouldn't make any
Difference to you

Go walking around, now
The wind's really blowing
It's too cold to talk
I wonder if she's knowing?
She should be with me
It could set her free
Come with me, be with me
A part of me

Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba, ba)
Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba)
Everything we will see
Everything we will be
We will be
A new child is born
The mother is still waiting
Father's over there
Anticipating
Won't you be with me?
It could set us free
Come with me, be with me
A part of me

Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba)
Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba)

Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba)
Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba)
Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba)...Embed
