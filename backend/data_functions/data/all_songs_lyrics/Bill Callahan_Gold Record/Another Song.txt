Another Song Lyrics
When work ain't been working all day
Why don't you come on home for lunch and stay?
We'll start working for love, not pay
When work ain't been working all day

We will finish our songs another day
And watch the light as it fades away
Lonesome in a pleasant way
I guess the light that's gone belongs to yesterday

And the light that's leaving takes its own sweet time
Changing colors slowly like fruit on the vine
And tonight, Lord, tonight, some of it is mine

As the shadows of the leaves on the wall
Grow and dissolve
Almost in time to our chests' rise and fall
Rise and fall
As we lay on the bed wanting
For nothing at all
Except maybe another song
Another song
Another song
Another song
Another song
Another songEmbed
