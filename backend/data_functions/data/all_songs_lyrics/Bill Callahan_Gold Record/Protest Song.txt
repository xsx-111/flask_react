Protest Song Lyrics
Well, the other night after a hard day of work
Where I left it all in the ring
I thought I'd unwind
And look at television
A late-night show
Where a singer came on
To sing
Some kinda protest song
Oh my God
Oh my God
His songs are lies
His songs are lies

Step aside, son
You're gonna get hurt
Step aside, son
They gonna get hurt

Well, somebody must stop
These boys
Messin' with a man's toys
Yeah, somebody must stop
These boys
Messin' with a man's toys
I protest his protest song
I protest his protest song
I'd vote for Satan
If he said it was wrong

Somebody must stop
These boys
They're messin' with a man's toys
Yeah, somebody must stop
These boys
They're messin' with a man's toys

Step aside, son
You're gonna get hurt
Step aside, son
You're gonna get hurtEmbed
