Ry Cooder Lyrics
Ry Cooder
He's a real straight shooter
Is that Ry Cooder?

So laid back and exact in his attack of the discipline
Like a cat I wonder what bag he's next going to get in

He's a real shapeshifter
Better call him Mister
Uh, Mister Cooder?

English rockers, all their money goes right up their nose
Well Ry just smiles and tries another difficult yoga pose

He's a real straight spiner
Gold song 49er

He freed Cuba with a Buena Vista
Him and them, and it turned me on to old Kim Sinh
And remember those licks he played on Chicken Skin
Now imagine him laying a part down right here where the song grows thin
Drawing all the listeners who tuned out right back in

He's a real sidekicker
And a mighty good leader
In and out of so many bags
A recent mandolin with bluegrass Ricky SkaggsEmbed
