Cowboy Lyrics
Well, I've been living like a cowboy
On the late, late movie

All I need is whisky, water, tortillas, and beans
And buffalo meat, one time per week
And give me some loving
When I come to town

Riding in on a conversation the morning after
The late, late movie stays with me

Through the mountain pass and the prairie grass
Crossing the border like a river
It's all one river
It's all one river crossing
So many times, I can't remember one river

Trying to fit it all in
Before the test pattern and the anthem
And off to bed you go, and off to sleep
And off to dream that trail you rideEmbed
