Breakfast Lyrics
I can hear her out
In the kitchen
Making breakfast for me

I'm still in bed and
I can see it all in my head
I’ll wash the plates that just don't break
As she lays her burden down for me

She don't eat, she don’t sleep
Why, she don't even drink
I drink so that we don't fight
She don't drink so that we don't fight

She hates to watch me eat
Or go hungry
Still loves me, you see

And she's been leaving like a sun tan
Ever since the sunset began
And when she leaves the surgery
She leaves her watching me
And breakfast is my favorite meal of the dayEmbed
