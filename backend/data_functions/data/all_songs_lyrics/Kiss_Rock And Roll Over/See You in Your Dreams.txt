See You in Your Dreams Lyrics
The party's over, and baby's in the corner
She's all alone for the night
You pick up the phone, you wanna go home
Well dry your eyes, it's all right, it's all right

See you, feel you in your dreams tonight
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight
Dreams tonight

When you're in the room, you're home too soon
You can't get me out of your mind
And you get in bed, you cover your head
My letter to you is signed
And this is what I'm saying

See you, feel you in your dreams tonight
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight
Dreams tonight

See you (See you), feel you in your dreams tonight
(Dreams tonight)
See you (See you), feel you in your dreams tonight
(Dreams tonight)
See you (See you), feel you in your dreams tonight
(Dreams tonight)
See you (See you), feel you in your dreams tonight
(Dreams tonight)
See you (See you), feel you in your dreams tonight
See you (See you), feel you in your dreams tonight
Dreams tonight
See you (See you), feel you in your dreams tonight
See you (See you), feel you in your dreams tonight
Dreams tonight
See you (See you), feel you in your dreams tonight
See you (See you), feel you in your dreams tonight
Dreams tonightEmbed
