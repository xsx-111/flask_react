Take Me Lyrics
Put your hand in my pocket
Grab onto my rocket
Feels so good to see you receive
Baby gotta know
Do you want to go
How you gonna make me feel

I said, "Whoa, baby
You make me feel ah, ah, ah, ah yeah
Oh, baby
You make me feel ah, ah, ah, ah yeah"

So take me, anyway you want me
Just break me, anyway you can
Take me, anyway you want me, now
Make me feel like a man, yeah

Sitting in the back
Her head down in my lap
The moonlight shining down on her hair
The radio was playing
Her fingertips were straying
Her mama didn't know she was there, no
She said, "Whoa, baby
You make me feel ah, ah, ah, ah yeah
Oh, baby
You make me feel ah, ah, ah, ah yeah"

So take me, anyway you want me
Just break, me anyway you can
Take me, anyway you want me, now
Make me feel like a man
Make me feel it, baby

Ah, take me anyway you want me
Just break me anyway you can
Take me anyway you want me, now
(Ah, ah, ah, ah yeah) Take me, baby
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Take me, make me, break me, love me
Squeeze me, hug me, anyway you can
Take me anyway you want me, now
(Ah, ah, ah, ah yeah)
(Ah ah ah ah)
Take me, whoo, anyway you want me
Squeeze me, you can have it any way you can
Take me, hold me baby
Come on, now, come on, now
(Ah, ah, ah, ah yeah)
(Ah ah ah ah)Embed
