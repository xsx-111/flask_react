Mr. Speed Lyrics
You need loving, you're looking out for new romances
Yeah it's true, you know you got to take your chances
When I laugh, well baby, don't you know you can cry
'Cause you ain't enough lady
To keep the master satisfied, yeah

Well you know, I got the kind of loving that you need
The kind of loving that you need
I'm so fast, that's why the ladies call me Mr. Speed
They call me Mr. Speed

You try pleasing, but getting on your knees don't make it
You try teasing, but baby, you can't even fake it, no
Made it clear, but baby, you can't even see me
So stop those tears 'cause baby
You can't even deceive, ah, ah

Yeah, you know, I got the kind of loving that you need
The kind of loving that you need
I'm so fast, that's why the ladies call me Mr. Speed
Look out!
Ow!
I don't care

Yeah, you know, I got the kind of loving that you need
The kind of loving that you need
I'm so fast, that's why the ladies call me Mr. Speed
Mr. Speed

Yeah, you know, I got the kind of loving that you need
The kind of loving that you need
I'm so fast, that's why the ladies call me Mr. Speed
Mr. Speed
Yeah, you know, I got the kind of loving that you need
The kind of loving that you needEmbed
