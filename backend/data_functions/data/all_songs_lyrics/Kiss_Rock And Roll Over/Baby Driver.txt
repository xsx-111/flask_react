Baby Driver Lyrics
Go, baby driver
Been driving on down the road
Oh, what a rider
Carrying such a heavy load
Don't ever need to know direction
Don't need no tow, no gas, no more!

Go, baby driver
Don't want to sleep alone
Ooh, what a rider
Push that pedal to the floor, yeah
Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been
And if you want to hear some stories
Exit girl, we'll let you in
I mean let you in (Let you in, let you in)

Go, baby driver
Ooh, what a rider
Go, baby driver
Ooh, you can pedal

Oh, baby driver, you've been driving too long
(Go, baby driver, go, baby driver)
Ooh, what a rider, you've been riding so long
(Go, baby driver, go, baby driver)
Don't ever sleep much past the sunrise
Too much of nothing, nothing, nothing like that, oh!
(Go, baby driver, go, baby driver)
(Go, baby driver, go, baby driver)

Go, baby driver
Ooh, what a rider
Go, baby driver
Come on!

(Go, baby driver, go, baby driver)
(Go, baby driver, go, baby driver)
(Go, baby driver, go, baby, go, go) She's got the car
(Go, baby driver, go, baby, go, go) Ooh, what a rider
(Go, baby driver, go, baby, go, go)
Ooh, are you doin' a hundred miles an hour
(Go, baby driver, go, baby, go, go)
Whoa, baby driver
(Go, baby driver, go, baby, go, go)
Ooh yeah
(Go, baby driver, go, baby, go, go)
Push that pedal to the floor
(Go, baby driver, go, baby, go, go)
All the way down
(Go, baby driver, go, baby, go, go)
Gun it, man, I'm runningEmbed
