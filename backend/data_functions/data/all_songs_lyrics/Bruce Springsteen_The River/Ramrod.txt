Ramrod Lyrics
Hey, little dolly with the blue jeans on
Wanna ramrod with you, honey, till half-past dawn
Let your hair down, mama, and pick up this beat
Come on and meet me tonight down on Bluebird Street
I've been working all week, I'm up to my neck in hock
Come Saturday night, I let my ramrod rock
She's a hot-stepping hemi with a four on the floor
She's a roadrunner engine in a '32 Ford
Late at night when I'm dead on the line
I swear I think of your pretty face when I let her unwind
Well look over yonder, see them city lights
Come on, little dolly, go ramrodding tonight

I said, come on, come on, come on, little baby
Come on, come on, let's shake it tonight
Come on, come on, come on, little sugar
Dance with your daddy and we'll go ramrodding tonight

Hey, little dolly, won't you say you will
Meet me tonight at the top of the hill?
Well, just a few miles across the county line
There's a cute little chapel nestled down in the pines
Say you'll be mine, little girl, I'll put my foot to the floor
Give me the word now, sugar, we'll go ramrodding forevermoreEmbed
