Fade Away Lyrics
Well now you say you've found another man
Who does things to you that I can't
And that no matter what I do
It's all over now between me and you, girl
But I can't believe what you say
No, I can't believe what you say
'Cause baby

I don't want to fade away
Oh I don't wanna fade away
Tell me what can I do? What can I say?
'Cause, darling, I don't wanna fade away

Well now you say that you've made up your mind
It's been such a long, long time since it's been good with us
And that somewhere back along the line
You lost your love and I lost your trust
Now rooms that once were so bright
Are filled with the coming night, oh darling

I don't want to fade away
Oh, I don't wanna fade away
Tell me what can I do? What can I say?
'Cause, darling, I don't wanna fade away
You say it's not easy for you
And that you've been so lonely
While other girls go out, doing what they want to do
You say that you miss the nights when we'd go out dancing
The days when you and I walked as two
Well girl, I miss them too
Oh I swear that I do
Oh girl

Now baby, I don't wanna be just another useless memory
Holding you tight
Or just some other ghost out on the street
To whom you stop and politely speak when you pass on by
Vanishing into the night
Left to vanish into the night
No baby

I don't want to fade away
Oh, I don't wanna fade away
Tell me what can I do? What can I say?
'Cause, darling, I don't wanna fade away
No darlin'
I don't want to fade away
No, I don't wanna fade away
Tell me what can I do? What can I say?
Oh, darling, I don't wanna fade away
Don't make me, darling
I don't wanna fade away
Don't make me, darling
I don't wanna fade away
I don't wanna fade away
I don't wanna fade away
I don't wanna fade awayEmbed
