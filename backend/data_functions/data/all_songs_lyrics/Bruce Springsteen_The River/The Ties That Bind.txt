The Ties That Bind Lyrics
You been hurt, and you're all cried out, you say
You walk down the street pushing people outta your way
You packed your bags and all alone you wanna ride
You don't want nothing, don't need no one by your side
You're walking tough, baby, but you're walking blind
To the ties that bind

The ties that bind
Now you can't break the ties that bind

Cheap romance, it's all just a crutch
You don't want nothing that anybody can touch
You're so afraid of being somebody's fool
Not walking tough, baby, not walking cool
You walk cool, but darling, can you walk the line
And face the ties that bind?

The ties that bind
Now you can't break the ties that bind

Whoa, I
I'd rather feel the hurt inside
Yes, I would, darling
Than know
Know the emptiness your heart must hide
Yes, I would, darling
Yes, I would, darling
Yes, I would, baby

You sit and wonder just who's gonna stop the rain
Who'll ease the sadness? Who's gonna quiet your pain?
It's a long dark highway and a thin white line
Connecting, baby, your heart to mine
We're running now, but, darling, we will stand in time
To face the ties that bind

The ties that bind
Now you can't break the ties that bind
You can't forsake the ties that bind
WhoaEmbed
