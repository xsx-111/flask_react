Drive All Night Lyrics
When I lost you, honey
Sometimes I think I lost my guts too
And I wish God would send me a word
Send me something I'm afraid to lose
Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives
I get shivers down my spine, girl
And all I wanna do is hold you tight

Baby, baby, baby
I swear I'll drive all night again just to buy you some shoes
And to taste your tender charms
And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms

Tonight there's fallen angels
And they're waiting for us down in the street
And tonight there's calling strangers
Hear them crying in defeat
Let them go, let them go
Let them go do their dances of the dead
(Let 'em go right ahead)
You just dry your eyes
And come on come on come on
Let's go to bed
Baby, baby, baby
I swear I'll drive all night again just to buy you some shoes
And to taste your tender charms
And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms

There's machines and there's fire, baby
Waiting on the edge of town
They're out there for hire
But baby, they can't hurt us now
Cause you've got, you've got
You've got my love, girl, you've got my love
Through the wind, through the rain, the snow, the wind, the rain
You've got, you've got my, my love
Oh girl, you've got my love
You've got my love
Oh girl, you've got my love
You've got my love
Oh girl, you've got my love
You've got my love, heart, and soul
Heart and soul
Heart and soul
Heart and soul
Don't worry, darling
Don't cry now
Baby, don't cry now
No, don't cry now
Oh, don't cry now
Just dry your eyes, baby
Dry your eyes
Baby, I'll drive all night
I swear I'll drive all night
Through the wind
Through the rain
Through the snow
Through the rain
Through the wind
Through the snow
Through the rain
I swear I'll drive all night
I swear I'll drive all night2Embed
