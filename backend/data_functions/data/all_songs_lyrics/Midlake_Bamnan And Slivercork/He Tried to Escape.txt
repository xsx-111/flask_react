He Tried to Escape LyricsHe tried to escape once in a balloon
He tried to escape once in a balloon
On the foggiest day, he decided not to stay
The ground below held his life not long ago
And through the fog, the ground, it disappeared
He felt he had made it and starts to come down
A crowd of people that followed were cheering loud
But then something went wrong and he couldn't get back in the air
And when he landed just inside the gates
The monocle men carried him awayEmbed
