Kingfish Pies LyricsParticle separation room
Is made without windows
They say it's because someone might break in
And take whatever they chose
And making kingfish pies takes much longer now
Without any windows
Particle separation room
Is made without tables and chairs
They say it's because they don't fit in here
We don't need tables and chairs
And making kingfish pies takes much longer now
Without any tables
Particle separation room
Is made with lots of big machinery
Well, sometimes it nears through work much faster
And they turn up the machines
And I just can't hold on
And once my hand got caught
And making kingfish pies takes much longer now
With my only one handEmbed
