Some of Them Were Superstitious LyricsSome of them were superstitious, sitting with their backs facing the orchard
All of them with mittens on their hands and feet were waiting there for winter
Thousands on the freeze, well I could never join them there
And we dare not bother, but couldn't help but holler "Yeah"
There's no use in hiding the joy from the bright of sun
I could wait for Winter. Better if it never comes
Some of them were superstitious, watching them parade around the townsquare
Some of them were praising while they're cold and simply 'cause they don't know better
Someone to protect them, someone to keep track of them
No I don't believe them. I would rather holler "Yeah"
There's no use in hiding the joy from the bright of sun
Now you say you're leaving, but leaving will just bring you down
Can you operate machines like that?
Miles a day on tough terrain and grass
I'm not sure if we will meet again
I guess it depends on which company you're in
Oh wait. You're gone, you're gone
So soon, so soon, so long
But life, it hurts for someone
And you're someone
So soon, so soon, so long
And when you're gone, you're gone
But life, it hurts for someone
And you're someone
And you're someone
And you're someone...Embed
