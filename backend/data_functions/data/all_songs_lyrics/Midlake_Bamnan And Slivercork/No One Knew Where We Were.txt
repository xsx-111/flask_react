No One Knew Where We Were LyricsOne gigantic heart
Just refused to start
And now that the world's behind me
I'll lay here quite joyfully
We went for a walk
To enjoy the day
Distracted by a bluebird
We looked the other way
Well both of them
Struck both of us
Upside the head
It made us dead
And no one knew where we were
Face up in a field
Flowers at our heels
Quickly comfort finds us
And takes us away from here
Well both of them
Struck both of us
Upside the head
It made us dead
And no one knew where we wereEmbed
