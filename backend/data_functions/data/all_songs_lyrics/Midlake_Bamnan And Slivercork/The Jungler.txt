The Jungler LyricsOh it must be over there
See in the tall weed
With his head leaned by an anthill
By some water with a trumpet
Lightly sleeps the jungler
But I'm not too sure
That we'd go out like that
So when we're older maybe sooner
We'll take the fumes from factories to love us
Half important not important
Not unless you go for gusto
Maybe we could overtake him
With a trumpet
Lightly sleeps the jungler
Wakes up and there goes with the gold
But not all the gold
Safely waits in this place
And when it's clear I'll get our gold
I'll get our gold
When we're older
We will thank the jungler
For all the gold that comes
Out our pocketsEmbed
