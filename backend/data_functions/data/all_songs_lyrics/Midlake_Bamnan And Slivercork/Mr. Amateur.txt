Mr. Amateur LyricsI'm mr. amateur
On the freeway
With a cupcake
And i couldn't fly
And i couldn't make where to go
So i stood alone with dirty face
From cupcakes in the air
And at that time
I wish i'd known you
With laserbeams and wearing birdsuit
You'd throw an extra sword
I'd catch it
I'm amateur
You're wonderfulEmbed
