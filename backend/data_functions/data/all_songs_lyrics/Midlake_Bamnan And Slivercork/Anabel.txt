Anabel LyricsBring with you a photograph machine
One for anabel and one for me
We walked to see the crowd
That gathered there ontown square
A big parade
The flutes got paid
I'm glad they made a dragon stage
The families nest
The bakers test
The children a mess
And the babies rest
The rain is cruel
And it's washing away the things
There in my headEmbed
