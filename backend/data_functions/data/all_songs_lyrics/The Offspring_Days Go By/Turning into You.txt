Turning into You Lyrics
A day to remember
The echoes and embers
Are heavy on my mind
The pictures are broken
The front door is open
The scars are left behind
The tables turn
Your words, they burn
They're leaving me undone
I flinch and shake
Until I break
I swear to God, for once
Could you just hear me?
Just really hear me...

I've been drowning in a sea
Of trying to please you
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I ever knew
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you

The music is hurting
The drugs aren't working
The walls come crushing down
Another rejection
For my insurrection
It's crawling back somehow
The tables turn
These words, they burn
I never should have come
I flinch and shake
Until I break
I swear to God, for once
Could you just hear me?
No, really hear me...
I've been drowning in a sea
Of trying to please you
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I ever knew
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
Turning into you!
I'm not how I used to be
I'm changing cause of you
I'm screaming just to breathe
It's all that I can do
I try to be me, but Iâ€™m turning into you
Turning into you

Anymore, find a way
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Anymore, find a way to there...
It's all that I can see
It's all that I can do
I try to be me
But I'm turning into you

Turning into you...Embed
