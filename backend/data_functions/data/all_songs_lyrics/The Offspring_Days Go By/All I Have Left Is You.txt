All I Have Left Is You Lyrics
I'll be the one
Spin me around
Lifting you up
And holding me down
Inside a storm is raging
It blows up in your eyes
Inside a heart is breaking
A river's running dry

I could run, I could hide
When I'm crashing down
Who's the one who saves me?
All intertwined
Wrap around me now with the thorns

And we're holding on
When there's nothing left to hold on to
So don't tell me when it's gone
’Cause all I have left is you
All I have left is you

Out of love, out of time
When I'm falling down
You're the one who saves me
All intertwined
Wrap around me now with the thorns
And we're holding on
When there's nothing left to hold on to
So don't tell me when it's gone
’Cause all I have left is you
Ohhh, well, there's nothing left to hold on to
So don't tell me when it's gone
’Cause all I have left
All I have left is you

I'll be the one
Lifting you up again
Inside a storm is raging
Hold me down, hold me down
Yeah, yeah
I'm lying here waiting
Lying here waiting
I'm lying here waiting for...

Ohhh, ’cause all I have left is you
All I have left is you1Embed
