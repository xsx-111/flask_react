Dirty Magic (2012) Lyrics
In my own simple way
I think she wants me only
She said come over right away
But she's just not that way
Her little soul is stolen
See her put on a brand new face

Go on and pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
Go on I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic
Oh, all The things you say
The games you play
Dirty magic stop

I should know better than
To think I'd reach inside her
It's all a cloudy kind of daze
She's not so sweet today
She mocks me, I'm no fighter
It all just seems like such a waste

It's oversimplified
It's oversimplified
It's oversimplified
