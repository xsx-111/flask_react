Dividing by Zero Lyrics
Oh, take me higher
All the way to the sun
Down to the wire
Fighting's only begun

It's closing in on you, closing in on you
Run from the fire raining down on you
It's closing in on you, closing in on you
And no way out

I will persevere
I will resist you here
I will interfere
I'm not the only son
My will will be done
A dissent begun

It's closing in on you, closing in on you
Run from the fire raining down on you
It's closing in on you, closing in on you
And no way out
I'm gonna make it through, gonna make it through
Divide by zero like a wrecking crew
It's closing in on you, closing in on you
And no way out
Oh, take me higher
All the way to the sun
I will persevere
I will resist you here
I will interfere

It's closing in on you, closing in on you
Run from the fire raining down on you
It's closing in on you, closing in on you
And no way out
I'm gonna make it through, gonna make it through
Divide by zero like a wrecking crew
It's closing in on you, closing in on you
And no way out1Embed
