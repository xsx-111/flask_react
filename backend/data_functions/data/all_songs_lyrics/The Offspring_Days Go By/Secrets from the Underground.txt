Secrets from the Underground Lyrics
Feel the way it grows when the words have left a mark
With the promise of tomorrow
That tricks and leaves you in the dark
There's something in the air
And there's something rising up
Not one, but a million that have had enough

Hey yo, no
I'm not gonna go away
I've got something more to say
Kick and scream
It knocks you down, it knocks you down
Hey yo, go
Underneath we'll tear you down
Secrets from the underground
Anger starts a fire

This is not an anthem or a threat in someone's name
But a promise that tomorrow
Will rock and burn if things don't change
There's something in the air
And there's something rising up
Not one, but a million that have had enough

Underneath we'll tear you down
Secrets from the underground


Hey yo, go
Hey yo, go
Secrets from the underground
Anger starts a fireEmbed
