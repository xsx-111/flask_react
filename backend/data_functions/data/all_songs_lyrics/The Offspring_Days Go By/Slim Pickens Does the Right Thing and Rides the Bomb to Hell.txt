Slim Pickens Does the Right Thing and Rides the Bomb to Hell Lyrics
Take me for a ride, I'm the one you pushed aside
But it's coming back to you
Ya it's coming back to you
Run to the sound, take it back and double down
Cause it's coming back to you
Ya it's coming back to you

Ahh well we're pouring gasoline
So dance around the fire that we once believed in
Ahh and we'll never be the same now
Cause there's nothing left for us to bleed
Give it up the champions of greed
So come around and have another round on me
Dance fucker dance let the motherfucker burn!

Snake is in the grass while you're living in the past
Saying whatcha gonna do?
Ya whatcha gonna do?
Earn never learn we'll be cheering while it burns
And we're coming after you
Ya we're coming after you
Slim Pickens well he does the right thing
And he rides the bomb to hell
Ya he rides the bomb to hell
Watch the pulse it quickens after every little sting
If you're gonna go to hell
Drink it up you might as well
Are you really gonna take it like that?
Riding on a missile with a cowboy hat

Ahh well the world is gonna end
So dance around the fire that we once believed in
I wanna tear it down again now
Cause there's nothing left for us to bleed
Give it up the sons of anarchy
So come around and have another round on me
Dance fucker dance let the motherfucker burn!

Are you really gonna take it like that?
Riding on a missile with a baseball bat

Ahh well we're pouring gasoline
So dance around the fire that we once believed in
Ahh and we'll never be the same
The takers and the liars that we all believed in
Ahh well we're going down in flames
So dance around the fire, we dance around the fire
Cause there's nothing left for us to bleed
Give it up the champions of greed
So come around and have another round on me
Dance fucker dance let the motherfucker burn!5Embed
