Hurting as One Lyrics
Been reaching for a reason for the pain that's come
Been waiting for the season when the healing's done
Well, lined up in black and white
This blood runs red on both sides

Broken in two
Hurting as one, hurting as one
Hurting as one, hurting as one
Hurting as...

See the battle, now it's raging in our hearts and minds
Hear the voices how they're shouting out the others' crimes
Well, our past lies dressed in white
We're all just dragged to the fight


Lined up in black and white
This blood runs red on both sides
Our past now thrown aside
We're all just dragged to the fight
Broken in two
Hurting as one, hurting as one
Hurting as one, hurting as one
We could be one, we could be one
We're coming undone, we could be one
Hurting as...Embed
