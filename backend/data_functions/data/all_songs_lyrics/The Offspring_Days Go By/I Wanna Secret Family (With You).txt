I Wanna Secret Family (With You) Lyrics
Every girl's a story
Call her Morning Glory
She works at the Pink Pony
Oohh
Dancing on the table
Married but he's able
Holding up his dollars
Pointing as he hollers

It's you!
Well, you knock me out, baby
I wanna secret family with you
Well, you knock me out, baby

It's too big to bag on
Gotta get my swag on
Looking for an add-on
Oohh
Standing in the mirror
Tryin' to get you nearer
Funky misdemeanor
And this is what he said
(He said)
I've been a lonely man
Such a lonely man
I've been a lonely man
Such a lonely man

It's you!
Well, you knock me out, baby
I wanna secret family with you
Well, you knock me out, baby
First we went to the buffet
With the cell phone put away
Girl, you dope like DEA
And it's bigger than both of us
You!
Well, you knock me out, baby
I wanna secret family with you
And it's all right


But now I've got you!
Well, you knock me out, baby
I wanna secret family with you
Well, you knock me out, baby
First we went to the buffet
With the cell phone put away
Girl you dope like D.E.A
And it's bigger than both of us
You!
Well, you knock me out, baby
I wanna secret family with you
Start a secret family with you
And it's all right
Yeah, it's all rightEmbed
