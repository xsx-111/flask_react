Turn on Your Love Light Lyrics
Without a warning you broke my heart
Taking it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standing in a dark clime
Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, baby please
I'm begging you baby, I'm on my knees

Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Let it shine on me let shine, let it shine, let it shine
When I get a little lonely in the middle of
The night
And I need you darling to make things all right
So come on baby, baby please
And I'm begging you baby, 'cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your lights let it shine on me
Turn on your love light let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

Without a warning, you broke my heart
Taken it baby, torn it apart
And you left me standing, in a dark clime
Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, I'm on my knees
(Post-chorus)
Well I get a little lonely in the middle of the nightEmbed
