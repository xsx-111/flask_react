Dark Star Lyrics
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light
Into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose
From the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the
Clouds of delusion

Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall
Of diamonds
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections
Of matter
Glass hand dissolving
To ice petal flowers
Revolving
Lady in velvet
Recedes
In the nights of goodbye
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall
Of diamonds1Embed
