And We Bid You Goodnight Lyrics
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Walking in Jerusalem, just like John
(Bid you goodnight,  goodnight, goodnight)
I remember right well, I remember right well
(Bid you goodnight,  goodnight, goodnight)
His rod and his staff shall comfort me
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "A" for the ark, that wonderful boat
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "B" for the beast at the ending of the wood
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
You know, it ate all the children that would not be good
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Walking in the valley in the shadow of death
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnightEmbed
