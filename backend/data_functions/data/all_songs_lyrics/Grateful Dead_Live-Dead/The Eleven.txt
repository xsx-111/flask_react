The Eleven Lyrics
High green chilly winds and windy vines
In loops around the twining shafts of lavender
They're crawling to the sun
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
Droop so hungry 'neath the sky, Ai-yi
Underfoot the ground is patched
With climbing arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita
Stark and shiny in the breeze
William tell has stretched his bow
'Til it won't stretch no furthermore
And/or it may require a change that hasn't come before
No more time to tell how, this is the season of what
Now is the time of returning with our thought
Jewels polished and gleaming
Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein
Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming
Seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll
Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow
Five men writing with fingers of gold
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale
Three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
Riding in the whalebelly, fade away in moonlight
Sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below1Embed
