Praying Hands Lyrics
You got your left hand
You got your right hand
You got your left hand
You got your right hand
Well the left hand's diddling
While the right hand goes to work
I said the left hand's diddling now
While the right hand goes to work
You got both hands
You got both hands
You got praying hands
You got praying hands
They pray for no man
They pray for no man

Okay, relax
And assume the position
Go into doggie submission

Wash your hands three times a day
Always do what your mom and dad say
Brush your teeth in the following way
Wash your hands three times a day
You got your left hand
You got your right hand
You got your left hand
You got your right hand
Well the left hand's diddling
While the right hand goes to work
I said the left hand's diddling now
While the right hand goes to work
You got both hands
You got both hands
You got praying hands
You got praying hands
They pray for no man
They pray for no man

Roll over, play dead
Get spiritual-minded
Okay, relax
And assume the position
Go into doggie submission
Wash your hands three times a day
Always do what your mom and dad say
Brush your teeth in the following way
Wash your hands three times a dayEmbed
