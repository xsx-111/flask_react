Top of the Pops Lyrics(Hold tight)
Now we're on our own
(Cue light)
Now it's ready to roll
(Tonight)
How I've waited for, aggravated for years
(It's fun)
Oh, I just can't wait
(Hold on)
Do I look up to date?
(You're on)
I'll do anything if that's the right thing to see
Doesn't matter what is shown
Just as long as everyone knows
What is selling, what to buy
The stock market for your hi-fi
Take the money
Leave the box
Everybody's on Top Of The Pops.
(There's one)
Born every day
(Sing song)
Then you fade away
(Ding dong)
What's the future in the pop music industry?
(All right)
So you made the grade
(Hold tight)
To the buck you've made
(Just wait)
You've been rated for constipated peak viewing time
Doesn't matter what is shown
Just as long as everyone knows
What's in fashion, what is seen
On the front of a television screen
Take the money
Leave the box
Everybody's on Top Of The Pops
(Hold tight)
Now we're on our own
(Cue light)
Now it's ready to roll
(Tonight)
How I've waited, for aggravated for years
(It's fun)
Oh, I just can't wait
(Hold on)
Do I look up to date?
(You're on)
I'll do anything if that's the right thing to see
Doesn't matter what is shown
Just as long as everyone knows
What is selling, what to buy
The stock market for your hi-fi
Take the money
Leave the box
Everybody's on Top Of The Pops
Pay the money
Watch the box
Everybody's on Top Of The Pops
Everybody's on Top Of The Pops
