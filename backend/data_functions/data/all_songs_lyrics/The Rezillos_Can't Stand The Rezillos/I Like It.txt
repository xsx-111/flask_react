I Like It LyricsI like it, I like it
I like the way you run your fingers through my hair
And I like the way you tickle my chin
And I like the way you let me come in
When your mama ain't there
I like it, I like it
I like the things you do and all the things you say
And I like it more with every day
And I like it always hearing you say
You're liking it, too
You're liking it, too
I'm asking you
What do you wanna do?
Do you agree
That the world was built for you and me?
I like it, I like it
I like the funny feeling being here with you
And I like it more with every day
And I like it always hearing you say
You're liking it, too
You're liking it, too
Do that again
You're driving me insane
Kiss me once more
That's another thing I like you for
I like it, I like it
I like the funny feeling being here with you
Ooh, and I like it more with every day
And I like it always hearing you say
You're liking it, too
You're liking it, too
I said I like it
Are you liking it, too?Embed
