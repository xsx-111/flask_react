Bad Guy Reaction LyricsOut in the streets in every town
Everybody keeps moving me down and down
From early morning 'til late at night
Nobody gonna give me no healthy jive
I'm getting that bad guy reaction
Status contraction all the time
Won't listen to me
You only try to put me down
Don't write my name on every wall
Go breaking windows or telephones
What sounds I rate, what movie show
Don't classify me with no one else
I'm getting that bad news reaction
Status contraction all the time
Won't listen to me
You only try to put me down

Don't write my name on every wall
Go breaking windows or telephones
What sounds I rate, what movie show
Don't classify me with no one else
Bad news reaction
Status contraction all the time
Won't listen to me
You only try to put me down
Don't think I'm stupid
Don't ever try to put me downEmbed
