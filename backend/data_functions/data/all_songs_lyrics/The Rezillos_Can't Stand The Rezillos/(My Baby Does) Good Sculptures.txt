(My Baby Does) Good Sculptures LyricsShe don't care for one night stands
And naughty boys with sweaty hands
She got a thing about carving wood
Or shaping a figure from a lump of mud
Don't love my baby for her pouting lips
Don't love my baby for her curvy hips
I love my baby ‘cause she does good sculptures, yeah
Her fingernails, rouge talons fonce
They cut my skin more than once
She is a thing made of solid love
She shape-a my body like a lump of mud
Don't love my baby for her pouting lips
Don't love my baby for her curvy hips
I love my baby ‘cause she does good sculptures, yeah
Work it, work it, work it, work it
Work it, work it, work it, work it
Work it, work it, work it, work it
Work it, work it, work it

Whoo!
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
Whoo!
Oh yeah!
She is cool in her studio
E I addi, addio
She killa-dilla, she cuts it smooth
Always looking like she never loose
Don't love my baby for her pouting lips
Don't love my baby for her curvy hips
I love my baby 'cause she does good sculptures, yeah
I love my baby ‘cause she does good sculptures, yeah
I love my baby ‘cause she does good sculptures
I love my baby ‘cause she does good sculptures
I love my baby ‘cause she does good sculptures, yeah
Yeah!Embed
