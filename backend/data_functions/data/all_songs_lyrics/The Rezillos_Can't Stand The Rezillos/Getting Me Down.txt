Getting Me Down LyricsWalking through the park, I'm like a child at play
Thinking 'bout the things I said I'd do today
Yeah, the state of things is getting bad, it's getting me down
I think I'll pack up all my bags and leave this town
It's getting me down
Money is the only thing that turns me on
But someone else has got it, and I got none
Oh, give it to me, baby, that's what I need
Living not existing, that's the thing for me
It's getting me down
I said it's getting me down

It's getting me down
I said walking through the park, I'm like a child at play
Thinking 'bout the things I said I'd do today
The state of things is getting bad, it's getting me down
I say I'll pack my bags and then I'll leave this town
It's getting me down Embed
