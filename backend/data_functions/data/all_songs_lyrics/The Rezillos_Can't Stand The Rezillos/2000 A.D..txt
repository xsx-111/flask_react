2000 A.D. LyricsI wanted to see if 2000 A.D
Was ever in place for someone like me
I looked at the future for a paperback culture
I think there was more in 1964
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

It's easy to see that 2000 A.D
Will never appear a reality
It's a slap in the face for the human race
Just to survive to be eaten alive
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

2000 A.D
(2000 A.D.)
I'm happy to be
(I'm happy to be)
Where everything's new
(Where everything's new)
And nothing is free
(And nothing is free)
I live in the future with the paperback culture
I came through the door from 1964
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
