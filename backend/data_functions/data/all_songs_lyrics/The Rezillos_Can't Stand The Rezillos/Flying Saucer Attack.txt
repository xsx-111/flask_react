Flying Saucer Attack LyricsThere's a threat approaching from the stars
All the horrors from Venus and Mars
Everybody'd better be on guard
When the flying saucers land
Watch the skies above the horizon
For the spies who have no flies on
When they appear through the stratosphere
Better lock yourself inside
Flying saucer attack
I'm never coming back
Oh, oh, oh, until it's over
Laser beams and gamma projectors
There'll be nothing on Earth to protect us
When they arrive out of the sky
They'll be frying us alive
Call out the Army and the United Nations
Alert the police and Air Force stations
Tell everybody to run and hide
Because the end is near at hand
Flying saucer attack
I'm never coming back
Oh, oh, oh, until it's over
There's a threat approaching from the stars
All the horrors from Venus and Mars
Everybody'd better be on guard
When the flying saucers land
Watch the skies above the horizon
For the spies who have no flies on
When they appear through the stratosphere
Better lock yourself inside
Flying saucer attack
I'm never coming back
Oh, oh, oh, until it's over
Oh, oh, oh, until it's over
Oh, oh, oh, until it's overEmbed
