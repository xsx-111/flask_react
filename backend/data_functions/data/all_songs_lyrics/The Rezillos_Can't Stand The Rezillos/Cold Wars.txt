Cold Wars LyricsThe footsteps echo through
A shady avenue
The checkpoint makes no stand
In an iron curtain land
Cold wars have cooled me down
Kept my ear to the ground
Cold, cold, coming your way
Cold, colder every day
Cold wars are here to stay
The darkness grew and grew
As I reached the rendezvous
I'll trade my suitcase in
For a taste of Western air
Cold wars have cooled me down
Kept my ear to the ground
Cold, cold, coming your way
Cold, colder every day
Cold wars are here to stay
A footprint in the snow
Leads to where I must go
Cold, cold, coming your way
Cold, colder every day
Cold wars are here to stay
The satellites of doom
Over beyond the moon
The comrades and the free
Now face redundancy
Cold wars have cooled me down
Kept my ear to the ground
Cold, cold, coming your way
Cold, colder every day
Cold wars are here to stay
