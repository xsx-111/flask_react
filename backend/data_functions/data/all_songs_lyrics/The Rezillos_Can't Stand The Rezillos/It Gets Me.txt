It Gets Me LyricsYou suddenly don't lack words
You talk so much, it’s uncool
We’re moving backwards
No progress 
All this talk, a-slinkin' and a-slockin'
Think you'll  until the leaves turn brown
It gets me
All I wanted to do was dance with you
Sometimes I wonder
If you really give a toss, man
Integrity lost, man
If you can be the boss man
All this talking around the point
I confess the plan, I wanna go home
Unhealthy
'Cause there’s a lot that we could do
All this talking around the point
And looking at me like that
And going on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on
You suddenly don't lack words
You talk so much, it’s uncool
We’re moving backwards
No progress 
All this talk, a-slinkin' and a-slockin'
Think you'll  until the leaves are brown
It gets me
All I wanted to do was dance with you
Talk to me of summer
It’s cold in Scotland this time of the year
And I don’t know if I’ll be here at the turning of the yearEmbed
