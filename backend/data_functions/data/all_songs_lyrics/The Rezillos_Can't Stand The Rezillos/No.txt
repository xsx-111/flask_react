No LyricsMommy, Mommy, can I climb all the trees in the park?
Mama, Mama, can I stay out 'til late in the dark?
Mama, Mama, don't overprotect me now
I just wanna have some fun at night
But I can hear you say
(No!)
Because I'm not old enough
(No!)
Because I've been told enough
(No!)
Because I should listen to my pa
What's wrong with the kids from the wrong end of town?
They're my friends, 'cause they always want me around
Hey Mother, don't underestimate them now
We're gonna have fun when the sun goes down
But I can hear you say
(No!)
Because I'm not old enough
(No!)
Because I've been told enough
(No!)
Because I should listen to my pa
Hey baby, shall we go for a stroll in the park?
Hey baby, shall we stay out 'til late in the dark?
Hey baby, if you overreact to me now
Then we could really have some fun tonight
But I can hear you say
(No!)
Because I'm not old enough
(No!)
Because I've been told enough
(No!)
Because I always listen to my ma
(No!)
Because I'm not old enough
(No!)
Because I've been told enough
(No!)
Because I always listen to my maEmbed
