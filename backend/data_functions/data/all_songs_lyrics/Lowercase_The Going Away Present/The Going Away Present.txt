The Going Away Present LyricsAntidotes for the fare-thee-well
Have not helped
Only made me ill
When I shake I want to hold still
But I can't cause I lost my will
When you said
Yeah I know what is right for you
Yeah I know what is right for you
Yeah I know what is right for you
Anecdotes of a long goodbye
No release
So I cannot cry
Now I'm sick fucked up and denied, oh
How I wish that you would not have lied
When you said
Yeah I know what its like for you
Yeah I know what its like for you
Yeah I know what its like for you
Ill at ease when I signed xo
Will you break your heart just for show
Even then I could not let you go, oh
With the gift of the past, you know
What I meant
Yeah I know what is right for you
Yeah I know what is right for you
Yeah I know what is right for you
You
