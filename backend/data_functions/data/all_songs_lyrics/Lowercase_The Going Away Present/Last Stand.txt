Last Stand LyricsNo one told me to go hide
So I sought instead
But found nothing left
That I could resurrect
I'm willing to face it baby
Can't you understand
That if I never come here
Then I'd have never planned to wait
I won't lie, this was only a way
I could try to prolong this pain
Hey hey my my, don't you ever feel the same
I was born to wait
To wait
To wait
I'm sorry that I
Could not make a scene
But when I had stopped by
I felt so deceived
Unwilling to fake it baby
Can't you understand
That I can't tear my heart out
If they only plan to wait
I won't lie, tt was the only way
I could die for the songs I sang
Hey hey my my, don't you ever feel the same
I was born to wait
To wait
To wait
When gunning the foresight
Be assured the sworn lie
Whether they gather together
Or disband or decide to embark
On another plan
You waitEmbed
