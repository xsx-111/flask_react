On a Bender LyricsA rescue party sent
But when it started in
I pushed away the hands
And then turned over
Had you known that I would break free
Would you still be sober
It came to rest just when
I'd harnessed all the din
An emptiness within
Produced once louder
Oh do you know the tune
Of my insomnia
Who's sung to sleep each night
A lesser man of wakened fright
Can you see the glass within my eyes
Can you see that I'm oh so tired
I can't see the difference in my life
The dream has all expired
Staid and walleyed
Made to wallow in
It ends your urge to be purged
By the finger that once pointed at you
Staid and walleyed
Made to wallow in
And you hope to be choked
By the nausea that creeps up in your throatEmbed
