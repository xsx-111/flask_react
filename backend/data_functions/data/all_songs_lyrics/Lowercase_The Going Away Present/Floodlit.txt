Floodlit LyricsWouldn't I stand over the ocean
Wouldn't I offer my soul
Wouldn't I hold out for devotion
To come back and take control
And I'd show you just what it is to be me
In love completely
Only I cannot breathe
Flooded out by emotion
I'm sheltered and bestowed
As the circumstances surround us now leave not one porous stone
Wouldn't I stand over the ocean
Wouldn't I drown my soul
In the tide of your own tongue
And swallow you up whole
And the numbness that gripped me senseless
When I first tasted your kiss
Has all but still remained
And it might rise slowly
But its always known that it overflows
And it subsides only when you let me go
And if I sink slowly underneath by the weight
It would only show that she sank before
And the lights die slowly
When you let me go in a darkened room
And it will shine only when I wake next to you
When and if I'm blinded
And if I can't say
It would only show what you let me show
And I owe my life to this
And I owe my life to you
And I want you to know
And I want you to know
I believe in you
Oh can you say what you can't denyEmbed
