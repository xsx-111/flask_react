Glisten To The Pink LyricsHang out the ferrous wire
Unhinge the mother
And leave for electric light
A candle to goad the meat
Innards of a weary womb
The loss keeps bleeding
The milk runs warm and mild upon the pavement
And I can see the light
A pinprick gleaming in all that you recognize
Where consciousness resigns
A man is draped across a balustrade of spine
He walks his fingers around your collar so maligned
He takes no prisoners that can hardly contain
His self-devotion as his sorrow starts to fade away
A glee man sneers at us
His voice confession
In stalls that you emphasize
Are holy latrines
And I can see the light
A pinpoint fleeting
From all the reasons why you pass out needing
A man is saved
A man is made to walk the line
Between the fore and aft
That spans the length of time
He was a singer yet could hardly entertain
His mixed emotion was his solemn saving grace
Don't you weigh your light out
Don't you weigh your light out
Don't you weigh your light out
Next time you're outEmbed
