The Open Sea Lyrics
Kill all of your allies
And spare me your dissent
Cause no one ever will die
A stranger to themself

You know that I can scrape by on glory and the sin
There's no doubt within my mind
That if I tried I'd win

And what I see the escape to be
Is experience and the open sea

Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yet you're alone
Yes I know
Yes I know
Yes I knowEmbed
