Route Lyrics
Reality, it burns
The way we're living is worse
Pillars of inspiration are all falling down
The clean-up won't work
While the fallout goes on

And it's now or never
Too close to the latter
We're all living proof that nothing lasts

Standing in the neutral zone
Living on sleep deprivation
The rural route sleeps
While the city bleeds all over itself
Over the falls in a barrel
Is where the answers have gone

And it's now or never
Too close to the latter
We're all living proof that nothing lasts

And it's here for now
Transient tomorrow
We're all living proof that nothing lasts

The Mother Road remains
It provides no more
It can only take us away
Southbound
You can taste the weather
It feels like home

And it's now or never
Too close to the latter
We're all living proof that nothing lasts

And it's here for now
Transient tomorrow
We're all living proof that nothing lasts
