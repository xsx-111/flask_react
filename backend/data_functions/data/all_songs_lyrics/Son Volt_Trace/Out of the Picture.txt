Out of the Picture LyricsYou may be quite sure you know where you're going
But sooner or later you're out of the picture
Too many lost names, too many rules to the game
Better find a focus or you're out of the picture
Somewhere along the way the clock runs out
Somewhere along the way it all stands still
Firemen save a millionaire's mansion
But when it's done, they sleep on the side of the road
You may be lost, you'll find just another paradigm
Just a stop frame in time, then you're out of the picture
Somewhere along the way the clock runs out
Somewhere along the way it all stands still
Take away this Columbus Day
No more bones on display
Blackhawk never had a say
Just taken out of the picture
Somewhere along the way the clock runs out
Somewhere along the way it all stands still
Somewhere along the way the clock runs out
Somewhere along the way it all stands stillEmbed
