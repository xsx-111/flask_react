Mystifies Me LyricsStay awhile and work it out of me
We got time and we can cast it true
Just give me a sign, I'll take your word
I'll learn anything you want me to
That is all I'm looking to you for
All I'm asking that you simply do
Take it leave it, make things matter
Lettin' all my breath away
Take it all apart and put it back
I am always left here looking at you
You look so fine true
You look so fine true
I would not lie to you
Let me see you, let me know your dreams
Won't you please give out a sign
Things you say make me look through you
No one mystifies me like you do
This is why I always look at you
And I hold you to it every day
You look so fine true
No one mystifies me like you do
You look so fine true
No one mystifies me like you doEmbed
