Tear Stained Eye LyricsWalking down Main Street
Getting to know the concrete
Looking for a purpose from a neon sign
I would meet you anywhere
The western sun meets the air
We'll hit the road, never looking behind
Can you deny there's nothing greater
Nothing more than the traveling hands of time?
Saint Genevieve can hold back the water
But saints don't bother with a tear-stained eye
Seeing traces of the scars that came before
Hitting the pavement still asking for more
When the hours don't move along
Worn-out wood and familiar songs
To hear your voice is not enough
It's more than a shame
Can you deny there's nothing greater
Nothing more than the traveling hands of time?
Saint Genevieve can hold back the water
But saints don't bother with a tear-stained eye
Like the man said
Rode hard and put away wet
Throw away the bad news, and put it to rest
If learning is living
And the truth is a state of mind
You'll find it's better at the end of the line
Can you deny there's nothing greater
Nothing more than the traveling hands of time?
Saint Genevieve can hold back the water
But saints don't bother with a tear-stained eye
Sainte Genevieve can hold back the water
But saints don't bother with a tear-stained eye1Embed
