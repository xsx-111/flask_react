Catching On LyricsCan't find a reason
Can't find a way
Guess it's not you and me
Only dogs have their day
Another case of words that melt
It's not a question of right
Nightmares in broad daylight
Season crash, season burn
You survive another turn
And now I'm reaching out, it's true
When you don't see me
I'm catching on to you
You don't see me
I'm catching on to you
Took a break to get that far
Like the sound from a hundred-dollar guitar
Bought from an old catalogue
Yesterday's dust and heartache
As the pieces fall
Like candy when you're young
Medicine when you're old
There's no reason or rhyme
Sidestepping around
On an elevator climb
When you don't see me
I'm catching on to you
Another jail, another burned-out inside
Skeleton love left to die
Take whatever lies ahead
The good with the bad and leave the rest
When you don't see me
I'm catching on to you
You don't see me
I'm catching on to you
Catching on
Catching onEmbed
