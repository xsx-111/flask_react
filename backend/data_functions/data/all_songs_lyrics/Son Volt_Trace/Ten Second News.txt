Ten Second News LyricsWhen you find what matters is what you feel
It arrives and it disappears
Driving down sunny 44 Highway
There's a beach there known for cancer waiting to happen
When you're out across the county line
The news travels slower than a ten-second buzz
But only you'll ever know
'Cause day by day, it disappears
Only you'll ever know
And it's hard enough soaking up billboard signs
You scorch and drown alive
Never knowing why the levee gates are open wide
There's a cough in the water and it's running into town
Bright eyes, don't change, stay the same
There must be an answer for what keeps it going on
But only you'll ever know
'Cause day by day, it disappears
Only you'll ever know, only you'll ever know
'Cause day by day, it disappears
Only you'll ever knowEmbed
