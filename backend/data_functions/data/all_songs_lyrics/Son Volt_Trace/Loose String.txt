Loose String Lyrics
One-way streets and square one
Answers don't come from any one direction
Not a care in the world, no better way to go
It's fine here, watching it go down

Half the trouble's in the asking
And I know you're not the kind to wait around
Taking chances with no intent to make a killing
Too much living is no way to die

Loose string
Find the pieces don't fit in
Loose string
Coming up for air again and again
Loose string
Too much living is no way to die

See the ground sinking round
Tomorrow is a card to play
Same old words heard in storms repeated doom
Too many rules, it will bleed you dry
Half the trouble's in the asking
And I know you're not the kind to wait around
Taking chances with no intent to make a killing
Too much living is no way to die

Loose string
Find the pieces don't fit in
Loose string
Coming up for air again and again
Loose string
Too much living is no way to die


Said you haven't seen it all
You just keep on searching for just one single reason

Half the trouble's in the asking
And I know you're not the kind to wait around
Taking chances with no intent to make a killing
Too much living is no way to die
Loose string
Find the pieces don't fit in
Loose string
Coming up for air again and again
Loose string
Loose string
