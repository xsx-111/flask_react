Brats LyricsMy little way to keep us in the papers
We like to truck it out
It's our own gamble
I waste away
To weak below the ankles
Know that we keep it clean
We never get our shots
I know we keep the piece
And what they offer
Do all the girls we know
And we'll get shot
I always wish for this option
You like the world with the melody
The real options are
And for the worse they know
They leave the color cool and black
And watch the devil world
And learn nothing in the end x 2
I won't stay out tonight
Sorry bought that sir but you have to show your anger
I enlist a child to stand up for the honor roll
Father enlists a girl to care about the answer
I enlisted her to stand up for the honor roll
The real options areEmbed
