Flood to Flood LyricsBring me breakfast after dinner
Don't forget I like my crayon
Tie me up in a red ribbon
Teach how to be a person
Bring me breakfast after dinner
Keep the weakness for the people
Tie me down when I'm in seizure
Keep me home away from people
After all I'm not a riddle
Twice been caught, but never kept in
I refuse to wake up set in
I refuse to be a person
Take him out, take him out
When the weather isn't loud
Take him out, take him out, take him out
Take him out, take him out
So the air can clear him out
Clean you out, take him out, take him out
They told me not to stay at home alone
So I don't know why its taken them so long
To turn a boat to God
Into a brother godEmbed
