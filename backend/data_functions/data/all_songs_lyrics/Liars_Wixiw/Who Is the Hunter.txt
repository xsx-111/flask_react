Who Is the Hunter LyricsI never meant to run
I only blew my gun to watch which beast still runs
A fall won't make a sound
You only held us bound to watch a fielder run
I only wanted more
I only wanted time to watch her feel around
I never stood too long
It won't do anyone to watch this river rise
I never meant to run
I only knew my one true hope the beast would run
I'll fall, hit and run
You only held me along to watch a fear arouse
I only wanted more
I only wanted time to watch her feel around
I never stay too long
It won't do anyone to watch that river riseEmbed
