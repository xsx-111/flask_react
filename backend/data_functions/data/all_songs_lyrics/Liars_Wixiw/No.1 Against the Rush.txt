No.1 Against the Rush LyricsI bloodied myself awake today
I'm running off, beyond life
I bloodied myself awake today
I'm running off, beyond life
The spiral down
Coming back
A dead end
Again and again and again and again
Those friends of ours
Will seem pretend
They do again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again
I bloodied myself awake today
I'm pushing off, beyond life
I bloodied myself awake today
This culture's a disease
When you see it through lights
And I want you out
Cause I warned you I want you out
Cause I warned you I want you out
Cause I warned you I want you out
Cause I warned you I want you out
Cause I warned you I want you outEmbed
