The Exact Color of Doubt LyricsI wonder
I wonder where you go
I conjure
I come up with a clue
To tell the time
Change day to night
Wood arrows lead you back inside
I'll never let you go
I'll never watch you
?
I'll always be your friend
I'll never let you down
You'll never be alone
I'll come home to you
?
To look ahead without doubtEmbed
