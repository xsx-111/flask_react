Octagon LyricsLeave me, I will break your heart
I will fall off where we start
Leave me, tell me I'm a loss
You know I won't be later on
I always knew you were right
I thought it all
I did
I always thought you knew out
I would it all
I want it all
I knew it well
I knew you will
You relieve it when you need it
You believe it on your own
Don't leave me here
Me all alone
Me all aloneEmbed
