Annual Moon Words LyricsOur last boat refused to arrive
Our last hope we live to die
So what i'll know
So what i'll know just how
Just how we'll say goodbye
Take my hand into your own
Moonlight every inch you row
The only way to break and see
Take my hand into your own
Theres nothing else understand
We can't get further than here
I can't get here on my own
It's so much farther than
It's much better than that
I'm on the way down
I'm on my way nowEmbed
