WIXIW LyricsYou’re sick, you’re wasteful
And refuse all my pain
You’re wasteful, refuse all pain
Don’t think, don’t think
Don’t think I’ll wait
Don’t think, don’t think
Don’t think I’ll wait
You are so wasteful
And now I see you got it all
I’m wishing long to chew these days
I’m chewing out the hero
And I am long …
Hollow life
Hollow life
Hollow life
And now I see it’s not enough
I wish you were here with me
I can no longer take it all
Wish you would now come back to me
Hollow life
Hollow life
Oh, oh, oh...
And now I see it's not a loss
But I wish you were here with me
I can no longer take it all
Wish you would now come back to me
Hollow life
You’re wasteful, refused (hollow life)
You're wasteful, refused (hollow life)Embed
