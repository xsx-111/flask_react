A Ring on Every Finger LyricsTake a walk, look around
There's a stopper to be found for the heartache
Where the rue, where the rust
There's no promise you can trust
That's the heartache
It goes bounce, bounce
It goes bounce, bounce
You're no better than you were
You're no better than you were
You're no better than you were when your heart fell apart
And it's broken
Still broken
You're broken
Because I do know why I feel so wed
All that you have left before is all that you will ever have and
All that you will ever have is all that you have left before
All that you have left before is all that you will ever know
All that you will ever know is all that you have left beforeEmbed
