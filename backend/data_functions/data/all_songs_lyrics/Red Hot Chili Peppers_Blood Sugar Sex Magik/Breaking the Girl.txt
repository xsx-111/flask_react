Breaking the Girl Lyrics
I am a man cut from the know
Rarely do friends come and then go
She was a girl soft but estranged
We were the two our lives rearranged

Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day

Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever, but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)

Raised by my dad, girl of the day
He was my man, that was the way
She was the girl left alone
Feeling the need to make me her home

I don't know what, when or why
The twilight of love had arrived
Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever, but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)


Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever, but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)14Embed
