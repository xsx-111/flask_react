He Lied About Death Lyrics
What gives you the right?
To fuck with our lives?
A devil born in paradise
A liar loves to lie
Keep watching your back
Killers always have killers on their track
Keep watching the sky
'cause you might get lucky again
I hope your drunken daughters are gay
You are the shadow of fear
You scare the love out of here
Like an ape in a cage
Small white man in a rage
Mellow suit, mellow smile
Limousines down murder mile
Watch the devil's at play
Drain the bottle empty
California today
Tomorrow it's you and me1Embed
