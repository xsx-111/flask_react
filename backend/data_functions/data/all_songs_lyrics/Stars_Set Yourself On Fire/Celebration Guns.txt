Celebration Guns Lyrics
So tomorrow there will be another number
For the one who had a name
A desert wind and a perverse desire to win
History buried in shame

Are the beating drums
Celebration guns
The thunder and the laughter
The last thing they remember

And then the next day, how will you know your enemy
By their colour or your fear
One by one you can cage them in your freedom
Make them all disappear

Six hundred sixty six hundred sixty days
Two guards, for one uncharged
This morning's paper's ink stains my fingers
My hands grow darker everyday

Goodnight, sleep light, stranger x3Embed
