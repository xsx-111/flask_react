Reunion Lyrics
In the year of my decline
Sucking freezies in the rain
Driving twisted to the suburbs
And then driving back again
Seventeen and half alive
Headlights illuminate the school
Inhale the powder from the science class, yeah
Nearly dying felt so cool
Your face is all that hasn't changed
You're reassembled just like me
But when I reach to touch your hand
You stroke mine gently

All I want is one more chance
To be young and wild and free
All I want is one more chance to show you
You were right for me
You were right for me

I'm back in gym and it's the same
As my name tag floats away
I had six too many drinks last night, yes
And that's why I made you stay
Plus I always wanted you
You liked to rock it in your car
You said you didn't understand me
Because I always tried to see too far
Well, Tainted Love's too fast to dance to
So let's leave them all behind
They hated us with everything they had
And we hated them in kind

All I want is one more chance
To be young and wild and free
All I want is one more chance to show you
You were right for me
You were right for me
All I want is one more chance
To be young and wild and free
All I want is one more chance to show you
You were right for me

Reunion, reunion... reunion, reunion
Reunion, reunion... reunion, reunionEmbed
