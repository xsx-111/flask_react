The Big Fight Lyrics
 How could you do it
 I couldn't say
 Years built on sand
 June until May
 Second to second
 Lied even while you held my hand
 It's death for the living
 Yes I am a ghost
 The mirror is cloudy
 I loved you the most
 You threw out the pieces
 Did things we didn't understand

He doesn't want her but he just won't let her go
He doesn't want her but he just won't let her go
She started breaking but she still won't let it show
He doesn't want her but he just won't let her go

 The clothes in the wardrobe
 Just send them to me
 There are bills here for you
 That's cause nothing is free
 We filled up with things
 To make us who we want to be
 Is she in the background
 I just wouldn't know
 Did I build you a prison?
 Please don't let me go
 I've unlocked the doors
 But you can't walk away from me

He doesn't want her but he just won't let her go
He doesn't want her but he just won't let her go
She started breaking but she still won't let it show
He doesn't want her but he just won't let her go
He doesn't want her but he just won't let her go
He doesn't want her but he just won't let her go
She started breaking but she still won't let it show
He doesn't want her but he just won't let her goEmbed
