Your Ex-Lover Is Dead Lyrics
When there's nothing left to burn
You have to set yourself on fire

God, that was strange to see you again
Introduced by a friend of a friend
Smiled and said, "Yes, I think we've met before,"
In that instant it started to pour

Captured a taxi despite all the rain
We drove in silence across Pont Champlain
And all of that time you thought I was sad
I was trying to remember your name

This scar is a fleck on my porcelain skin
Tried to reach deep but you couldn't get in
Now you're outside me, you see all the beauty
Repent all your sin

It's nothing but time and a face that you lose
I chose to feel it and you couldn't choose
I'll write you a postcard, I'll send you the news
From the house down the road from real love
Live through this and you won't look back
Live through this and you won't look back
Live through this and you won't look back

There's one thing I want to say so I'll be brave:
You were what I wanted, I gave what I gave
I'm not sorry I met you, I'm not sorry it's over
I'm not sorry there's nothing to save
I'm not sorry there's nothing to save6Embed
