Calendar Girl Lyrics
If I am lost for a day, try to find me
But if I don't come back, then I won't look behind me
All of the things that I thought were so easy
Just got harder and harder each day
December is darkest, in June there's the light
But this empty bedroom won't make anything right
While out on the landing a friend I forgot to send home
Who waits up for me all through the night

Calendar girl who's in love with the world, stay alive 
I dreamed I was dying, as I so often do
And when I awoke I was sure it was true
I ran to the window; threw my head to the sky
And said "Whoever is up there, please don't let me die"
But I can't live forever, I can't always be
One day I'll be sand on a beach by a sea
The pages keep turning, I'll mark off each day with a cross
And I'll laugh about all that we've lost

Calendar girl who is lost to the world, stay alive 
January, February, March, April, May
I'm alive
June, July, August, September, October
I'm alive
November, December, yeah all through the winter
I'm alive 3Embed
