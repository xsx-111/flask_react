Soft Revolution Lyrics
We are here to save your life
The fool, the drunk, the child, and his wife
We won't let the sun go down
We gonna chase the demons out of town
Singing when you feel alone
Backwards through the megaphone
Singing to the ones you love
And the ones you'd like to be rid of
We are here to take the blame
To take the taunts and if the shame
We are here to make you feel
It terrifies you, but its real
It will keep you up all night
And in the flood of morning light
Spilling out across your room
You say the words will get there soon
The revolution wasn't bad
We hit the streets with all we had
A tape recording with the sound
Of the Velvet Underground
A K-Way jacket torn to shreds
And a dream inside our heads
And after changing everything
They couldn't tell we couldn't sing
After changing everything
They couldn't tell we couldn't sing
They couldn't tell we couldn't sing
And that changes everythingEmbed
