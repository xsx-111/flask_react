Ageless Beauty Lyrics
Ageless beauty
Cruelty makes its holes, but
On the shoreline
Time will hold its promise

We will always be a light
(You can see it from the surface, see it)
We will always be a light
(You can see it from the surface, see it)
We will always be a light

Tattered fingers
Lingering on the warm and foolish
Hardened faces
Graceless, we'll lose the battle

We will always be a light
(You can see it from the surface, see it)
We will always be a light
(You can see it from the surface, see it)
We will always be a light
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo

Oceans won't freeze
So loosen your heart
Underestimated
Undefeated in this love

We will always be a light
(You can see it from the surface, see it)
We will always be a light
(You can see it from the surface, see it)
We will always be a light
(You can see it from the surface, see it)
We will always be a light
(You can see it from the surface, see it)
We will always be a light
(You can see it from the surface, see it)
We will always be a lightEmbed
