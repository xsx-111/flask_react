Sleep Tonight Lyrics
We don't want to sleep tonight
Still young like that I count the lines
Beside your mouth that smiles now
My arms reach up as you go down
With buried heads we both forget
All of the past and its regret
Wind picks up, the window shakes
We won't hear the morning break

You will cry
And I will cry
'Cause all the love's
Alive tonight
You will cry
And I will cry
'Cause all the love's
Alive tonight

Neighbourhoods will try to dream
While you and me we hold and lean
Onto bodies slick and charged
Together just one beating heart
All around us quiet now
We hear the leaves fall to the ground
Morning light upon our bed
An ally while I catch your breath
You will cry
And I will cry
'Cause all the love's
Alive tonight
You will cry
And I will cry
'Cause all the love's
Alive tonight
You will cry
And I will cry
'Cause all the love's
Alive tonight
All the love's alive tonightEmbed
