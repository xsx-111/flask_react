The First Five Times LyricsThe first time, in your backyard
Underneath the plastic sheeting
Outside, it was pouring
And we were drunk as shit
Next time, at a party
When all our friends were there
There is nothing like bare mattresses
Underneath the stairs
The third time, in the doorway
The lights all on around us
And the audience beside us
And your old man watching from the trees
Fourth time, I said that's that
You've agreed to give me everything
Now I've got to ask you one more thing
Keep doing that forever
Fifth time in your bedroom
And finally, we rested
And you leaned upon your elbow
And began to speak to me
But you stopped yourself and kissed me
And I grabbed your wrist and told you
I know, I know, I know
I feel the same as you
And everyday, it's changed since then
In every way, I've changed since then
And everyday, it's changed since then
In every way, I've changed since then
Driven outside and driven in
Driven outside and driven in
And driven in, driven inEmbed
