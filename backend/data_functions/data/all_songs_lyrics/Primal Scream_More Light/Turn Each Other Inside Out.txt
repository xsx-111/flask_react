Turn Each Other Inside Out LyricsBlood of her mystery, bloom of her history
Roots of her blood, perfume of cups
Inner white thigh hidden from sun
Spine tangle knots, poems in her hair
We do it apart, do it in the dark
Teeth tongue, her bite, pulls sheets apart
Blood of her mystery, bloom of her history
Spine tangle knots, poems in her hair
You do, do that hoodoo
You do, do that hoodoo
You do, do that hoodoo
You do, do that hoodoo
We do it apart, do it in the dark
Teeth tongue, her bite, pulls sheets apart
Blood of her mystery, bloom of her history
Spine tangle knots, poems in her hair
You do, do that hoodoo
You do, do that hoodoo
You do, do that hoodoo
You do, do that hoodoo
Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out
We do it apart, do it in the dark
Teeth tongue, her bite, pulls sheets apart
Blood of her mystery, bloom of her history
Spine tangle knots, poems in her hair
Turn each other inside out (You do, do that hoodoo)
Turn each other inside out (You do, do that hoodoo)
Turn each other inside out (You do, do that hoodoo)
Turn each other inside out (You do, do that hoodoo)
Turn each other inside out (You do, do that hoodoo)
Turn each other inside out (You do, do that hoodoo)Embed
