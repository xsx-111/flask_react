Tenement Kid LyricsI don't know why I feel like I do
Rats in my head, stones in my shoes
I can't explain the way that I feel
It hovers like a ghost inside of me, I know it's real
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Slum education, tenement kid
He knew the score, kept it well hid
Mother was damaged, father was too
Handed down the generations, inheritance blues
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Something is broken, always unspoken
Please cut me open, let me have this
Something is broken, always unspoken
Please cut me open, let me have this
I don't know why (?)
Grabbed like a memory with a broken wind
I don't know why (?)
Grabbed like a memory with a broken wind
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Some find it easy to find their way home
Some always troubled in some kind of storm
Some always wounded, injured and wronged
Crying and screaming from coast to coast closed like a fist
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know whyEmbed
