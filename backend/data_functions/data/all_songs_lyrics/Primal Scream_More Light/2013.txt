2013 Lyrics21st century slaves
A peasant underclass
Television, propaganda, fear
How long will this shit last?
Punk rock came and went and nothing changed
Was it just a pose?
Every generation buys the lie
Just like the one before
Bought and sold
What happened to the voices of dissent?
Getting rich, I guess
Become part of the establishment
Power corrupts the best
They killed the counterculture underground
It offers no critique
No revolutionary spirit left
They've sanitized the freaks
It's the final solution to teenage revolution
The total subjugation of the rock and roll nation
Inducted, corrupted, seduced and reduced
Deluded, excluded, shackled and hooded

2013, alright
Soldier boys dying in the war
Hear their mothers cry
The chairman of the board of B.P./Shell
Are guilty of war crimes
Thatcher's children make their millions, hey
Remember Robespierre!
Guilty of complicity is guilt
What are we doing here?
It's the final solution to teenage revolution
The total subjugation of the rock and roll nation
Inducted, corrupted, seduced and reduced
Deluded, excluded, shackled and hooded

2013
2013, come on
Make a pact with prostitution
Sow disorder in the family
You speak of love, you speak of colours
You fear in others what you fear in yourself
You hate in others what you lack in yourself
Souls in chains (the underground horses are rising)
Souls in pain (the underground horses are rising)
Souls in chains (the underground horses are rising)
Souls in pain (the underground horses are rising)
Souls in chains (the underground horses are rising)
Souls in pain (the underground horses are rising)
Souls in chains (the underground horses are rising)
Souls in pain (the underground horses are rising)
Equalized, normalized, sanitized, lobotomized
Equalized, normalized, sanitized, lobotomized

Equalized, normalized, sanitized, lobotomized
Truth and lies, truth and lies, truth and lies, truth and lies
Truth and lies, truth and lies, truth and lies, truth and lies
Truth and lies, truth and lies, truth and lies, truth and lies
Truth and lies, truth and lies, truth and lies, open your eyesEmbed
