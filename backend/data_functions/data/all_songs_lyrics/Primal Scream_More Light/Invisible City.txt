Invisible City LyricsThe flashing lights and police cars
Polysexual gutter stars
Brutal stares of skinhead crops
The corner boys look like their dogs
Kebab shops, pubs and mosques
The dancing clubs, synagogues
The police station, crackhouse zombies
The readers wife, suburban origin
Invisible city
Invisible city
Invisible city
Invisible city
The pissed up girls, Kiara tans
Miniskirts and one night stands
Up the duff, sunlit thighs
Miss the father of their lives
The withered streets, hallucination
Strange faces like a bacon painting
Midnight drive in a neon sunshine
I love this city, such a beautiful city
Invisible city
Invisible city
Invisible city
Invisible city
Another freak who left you waiting
Politician, dead TV
Sack of shirts, spin of garbage
Tonight at that frequency, tonight at that frequency
Invisible city
Invisible city
Invisible city
I love this city, such a beautiful city
The withered streets, hallucination
Strange faces like a bacon painting
Midnight drive in the neon sunshine
I love this city, such a beautiful city
Invisible city
Invisible city
Invisible city
I love this city, such a beautiful city
Invisible city
Invisible city
Invisible city
I love this city, such a beautiful city
Invisible city
Invisible city
Invisible city
I love this city, such a beautiful cityEmbed
