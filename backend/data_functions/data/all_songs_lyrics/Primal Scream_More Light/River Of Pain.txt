River Of Pain LyricsJohnny's home, drunk again
Quoting from "The rights of man", it's midnight
Working late, job he hates
Rage he can't communicate inside him
Susan's roused from her bed
To frozen kitchen, silent without protest
Half asleep, food on stove
Threat and insults, a rain of blows screaming hell
Oh, you feel the shame
Oh, you feel the pain
When there's nothing you can do
You carry it with you
Susan tries her best to hide
The blues and purples around her eyes with make up
She gets the kids dressed for school
They all pretend it never happened
Little children bury deep
Awful secrets they must keep inside them
Damaged daughters, damaged sons
River of pain in every one
Oh, you feel the shame
Oh, you feel the pain
When there's nothing you can do
You carry it with you
When there's nothing you can do
You carry it with you
Oh, you feel the shame
Oh, you feel the pain
When there's nothing you can do
You carry it with you
When there's nothing you can do
You carry it with you
When there's nothing you can do
You carry it with youEmbed
