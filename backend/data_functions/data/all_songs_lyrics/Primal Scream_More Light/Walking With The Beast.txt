Walking With The Beast LyricsViolence in the air, damage everywhere
Murder in my dreams, waking up to screams
I just canâ€™t explain the way I feel inside
Hits me like a train, eating me alive
Walking with the beast
Walking with the beast
You can't get no peace
Walking with the beast
You can't get no peace
You can't get no peace
Walking with the beast
There goes another man, his future in his hands
Doesn't know he's going down, he's still laughing as he drowns
His pain is his disease, hurts him every time we breathes
Hates himself and everyone, he's sucking on loaded gun
Walking with the beast
Walking with the beast
You can't get no peace
Walking with the beast
You can't get no peace
You can't get no peace
Walking with the beastEmbed
