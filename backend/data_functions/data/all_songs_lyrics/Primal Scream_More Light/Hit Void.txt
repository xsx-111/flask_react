Hit Void LyricsStupefied and crazy, lonely as a ghost
Condemned, handcuffed and blindfolded, they tied me to a post
They gave me one last cigarette, put a target on my chest
The captain gave the order, you can guess the rest
Captured trying to navigate, the city sewers
I met a lot of creatures but no one like you
Flashing on you baby, thought the lights were green
Went crashing through a red into a head-on scene
Hit void, hit void, hit void, hit void
Hit void
Joined the demonstration, one million on the streets
Singing songs and waving banners, rioting for peace
Dreams of civil insurrection sold like junk from Indo-China
Disappeared when everyone went home to watch the Champions League Cup Final
You can't buy a revolution like a new TV
Read your Marx and Engels, get a strategy
Be a situationist like Guy Debord
Explode yourself in protest in the House of Lords
Hit void, hit void, hit void, hit void
Hit void
Captured trying to navigate, the city sewers
I met a lot of creatures but no one like you
Flashing on you baby, thought the lights were green
Went crashing thru a red into a head-on scene
Hit void, hit void, hit void, hit void
Hit void, hit void, hit void, hit void
Hit void, hit void, hit void, hit void
Hit void, hit void, hit void, hit void
