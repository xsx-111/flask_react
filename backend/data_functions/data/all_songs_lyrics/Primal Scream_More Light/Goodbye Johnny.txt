Goodbye Johnny LyricsJohnny, everybody's drunk in the world below
Johnny, it's a soundless sound when the sun don't show
The nights up there are like the great escape
To push me down how it suffocates
Goodbye Johnny, goodbye Johnny, goodbye Johnny
Johnny, I've been turning bad everyday
Johnny, I'd go across the world but not away
There's nobody who looks like her
There is nobody who can be like her
Goodbye Johnny, goodbye Johnny, goodbye Johnny
Can't see no colour, no black, no red
Can't hear anything anybody says
Oh, how the passion gets crushed under the sky
Oh, how I hate everything that is mine, goodbye Johnny
Johnny, everybody's drunk in the world below
Johnny, it's a soundless sound when the sun don't show
Somebody made it and I just can't fit
And here's the excuse I have for it
Goodbye Johnny, goodbye Johnny, goodbye Johnny
Goodbye Johnny, goodbye Johnny, goodbye Johnny
Goodbye JohnnyEmbed
