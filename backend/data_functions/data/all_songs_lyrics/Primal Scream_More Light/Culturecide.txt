Culturecide LyricsTrain leaves the city, high on the tracks
Holocaust central howling at my back
View from the carriage, safe behind glass
Wounded streets, graveyard flats
Dishrag curtains, screams of disease
Satellite dish where the window should be
Breezeblock prison, somebody's home
Looks like it's been hit by a neutron bomb
(By a neutron bomb, by a neutron bomb)
(By a neutron bomb, by a neutron bomb)
Jackie is a mother doing her best
The kids ain't got a father, the motherfucker left
Bottom of the pyramid, economic slave
Working two jobs for a minimum wage
Paying her taxes, paying her rent
Can't clothe the kids 'cause the money's been spent
The kids are in care, system of abuse
What d'ya feel about yourself when nobody wants you?
Culturecide (culturecide, culturecide)
Culturecide (culturecide, culturecide)
When your baby is crying 'cause it's hungry and cold
And your wife wants to leave you 'cause you haven't got a job
Will you shit on your brother, stab him in the back?
You gotta survive man by doing what you can
It's the new dark ages, every man for himself
Don't ask for mercy, don't ask for help
You need a will to power, a triumph of the will
Like the politicians, black magicians who do what they wilt
Elected criminals, legalized crime
Passing new laws, protecting their kind
Culturecide (culturecide, culturecide)
Culturecide (culturecide, culturecide)
Culturecide (culturecide, culturecide)
Culturecide (culturecide, culturecide)
Teenage drug gangs, running with machine guns
Miles of favelas up and down the M1
Law of the jungle, ghetto mentality
Like Margaret Thatcher said, "There's no thing as society"
Free market credo, economic theology
High priest bankers, stealing your money (don't buy the lie)
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country (culturecide)
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
(Take a look in your children's eyes)
Living like a refugee in your own country
(Take a look in your children's eyes)
Living like a refugee in your own country
(Take a look in your children's eyes)
Living like a refugee in your own country
(Take a look in your children's eyes)
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own country
Living like a refugee in your own countryEmbed
