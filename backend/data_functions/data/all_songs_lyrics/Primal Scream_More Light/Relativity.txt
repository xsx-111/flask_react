Relativity LyricsYou're stuck in yesterday
Sad negativity
Glad I never see you
Glad I never see you
There's nothing left to say
There's nothing left to say
You haven't changed
You haven't changed
Obsessed by other people lives
That's how you spend your time
Like Hepatitis C
Or any STD
You're to be avoided
You're to be avoided
You haven't changed
You haven't changed
You haven't changed
You're getting older
I guess you must be lonely
Fair-weather friends run out
When the drugs run out
Broken like your family
Broken like your family
Guess you must be lonely
Guess you must be lonely
You haven't changed
You haven't changed
You haven't changed
You're too scared to change, oh
You're a fucking mess
Condemned to repeat
That sad, sick old version
Of yourself
For the rest of your life
For the rest of your life
Guess you must be lonely
Guess you must be lonely
For the rest of your life
For the rest of your life
You haven't changed
You're too scared to change
You're stuck in yesterday
Time to be there
Somewhere is nowhere
Feel you can touch
Someone or nothing
Feel everything
Stop, never listen
Feel, be a fool
Strangers are laughing
Time to be there
Somewhere is nowhere
Feel you can touch
Someone or nothing
Feel everything
Stop, never listen
Feel, be a fool
Strangers are laughing
Time to be there
Somewhere is nowhere
Feel you can touch
Someone or nothing
Feel everythingEmbed
