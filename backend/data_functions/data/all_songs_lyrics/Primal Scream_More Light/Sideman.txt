Sideman LyricsHe won't but then again he might
Changes colour overnight
Agrees with everything you say
Just as long as he gets paid
He's the sideman
He's the sideman
Watch you back, man
He's at your side, man
Smiling face for every place
Politesse and mannered grace
Acting out his chosen role
Never let him get too close
He's the sideman
He's the sideman
Watch you back, man
He's at your side, man
Nothingness behind his eyes
Always centered on the prize
Snide behind the winning smile
Always goes the extra mile
He's the sideman
Sideman
Watch you back, man
He's at your side, man
Blind ambition, empty words
Platitudes so well rehearsed
A perfect dinner guest, I'm told
A liar with a plastic soul
He's the sideman
Sideman
Watch you back, man
He's at your side, man
He's the sideman
Sideman
Watch you back, man
He's at your side, man
He's the sideman
Sideman
Watch you back, man
He's at your side, man
Sideman, la-la-la, sideman, la-la-la
Sideman, la-la-la, sideman, la-la-la
Sideman, la-la-la, sideman, la-la-la
Sideman, la-la-la, sideman, la-la-laEmbed
