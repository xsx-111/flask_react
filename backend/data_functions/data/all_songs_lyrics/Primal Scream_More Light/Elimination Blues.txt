Elimination Blues Lyrics(Ooh, ah ha)
(Ooh, ah ha)
Rollin' and a tumblin', baby
Feelin' mighty sad (ooh, ah ha)
Crawlin' and a stumblin' baby
Feeling mighty bad (ooh, ah ha)
Ah ha, ah ha
Ah ha, ah ha, get along
Screamin' and a hollerin' baby
Hate to be alone (ooh, ah ha)
Ooh, the sky is cryin', baby
Rainin' tears of stone (ooh, ah ha)
Ah ha, ah ha
Ah ha, ah ha, get along
Long black hair, eyes of brown
My baby's gone, she's leavin' town
Long black hair, eyes of brown
My baby's gone, she's leavin' town
Long black hair, eyes of brown
My baby's gone, she's leavin' town
Long black hair, eyes of brown
My baby's gone, she's leavin' town
(Ooh, ah ha)
Ooh
Ooh
Screamin' and a hollerin', baby
She's broken up my home
Cryin' and a stumblin', baby
Hate to be alone (ooh, ah ha)
Screamin' and a hollerin', baby
Hate to be alone
Ooh, the sky is cryin', baby
She's broken up my home
Ah ha, ah ha
Ah ha, ah ha, get along (get along)
Long black hair, eyes of brown
My baby's gone, she's leavin' town
Long black hair, eyes of brown
My baby's gone, she's leavin' town
Long black hair, eyes of brown
My baby's gone, she's leavin' town
Long black hair, eyes of brown
My baby's gone, she's leavin' town
(Ooh, ah ha)
Get along (ooh, ah ha)
Get alongEmbed
