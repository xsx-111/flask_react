Manic Depression LyricsManic depression touching my soul, yeah
I know what I want but
I just don't know about how I get it
Music, sweet music drops on my fingers
Manic depression captured my soul
Woman so weary, sweet cause in vain, vain
You make love, you break love
It's all the same
(It's all the same when it's over)
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, I could caress
Manic depression, frustrating mess
A frustrated mess, yeah, oh-oh yeah
C'mon, give it to me
Push it, push it, push it
Yeah
Yeah
C'mon, play the blues
Ooh
Yeah
Well, I think I'm gonna turn myself off
And go on down, yeah
Really ain't no use in me hangin' around
(You know what I'm tryin' to say)
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, with a kiss
Oh! Manic depression, frustrating mess
A frustrated mess
Frustrated, hmmm
Yeah
Manic depression, frustrated mess
(Thank you, good night)Embed
