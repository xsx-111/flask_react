Fool You LyricsAs I wondered... walk along on a lazy path
I shook a hand, he seemed to know so much more
So I listened... tried my best just to understand, yeah
Then I followed to where I knew nothing of
Over the hill, come see the thrill awaiting you
There's so much more, go thru the door
Walk in the big parade
Learn just what to say
They will all try to fool you
Don't believe anything
I'm your everything
They will all try to fool you
And don't ever think you'll see another friend
See another friend
As time went on, we were friends of a different kind
But something there always tearing apart
Standing tall on a surface of glass and rain, yeah
We travelled on with a hope and a prayer
Over the hill, come see the thrill awaiting you
There's so much more, go thru the door
Walk in the big parade
Learn just what to say
They will all try to fool you
Don't believe anything
I'm your everything
They will all try to fool you
And don't ever think you'll find a better friend
Walk in the big parade
Learn just what to say
They will all try to fool you
Don't believe anything
I'm your everything
They will all try to fool you
Walk in the big parade
Learn just what to say
They will all try to fool you
Don't believe anything
I'm your everything
They will all try to fool you
And don't ever think that I could do you wrongEmbed
