Cigarettes LyricsHave you gotten any cigarettes
And have you got anything for me
I no longer know just what I'm saying
Is this how it's supposed to be
Sometimes I think the pain blows my mind
Pain blows my mind
Is it June or late September
Is it 1993
Could you help me to remember
Is this how I'm supposed to be
Sometimes I think the pain blows my mind
Pain blows my mind
Did you ever get those cigarettes
And did you get anything for me
Will you help me to remember
When I fall into the sea
Sometimes I think the pain blows my mind
Pain blows my mind
Pain blows my mind
Pain blows my mindEmbed
