Shoes LyricsThere can be but better ways
From yesterdays to me
Somewhere there are better days
For better ways to be
Sunny days have funny ways
Of quieting the roar
Is it still a blessed thing
To live and live some more
And I'm left with the truth
And I'm right in my mind
Given some of the time
Maybe never!
So I walk in these shoes
When I feel it's the blues
If it ain't it will do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I woke up early one morning
Like I'd been under a spell
Gazed into the mirrored reflection
Said I had to do it or else
And I'm left with the truth
And I'm right in my mind
Given some of the time
Maybe never!
So I walk in these shoes
When I feel it's the blues
If it ain't it will do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Things are true
There can be but better ways
From yesterdays to me
Somewhere there are better days
For better ways to be
Sunny days have funny ways
Of quieting the roar
Is it still a blessed thing
To live and live some more
And I'm left with the truth
And I'm right in my mind
Given some of the time
Maybe never!
So I walk in these shoes
When I feel it's the blues
If it ain't it will do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I walk in these shoes
Yeah, yeahEmbed
