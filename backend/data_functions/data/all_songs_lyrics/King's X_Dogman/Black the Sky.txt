Black the Sky LyricsOk so it can't be right
I cry and try and think and fight
Ok so I need some help
But they can't fix the way I feel
Just one day, just one second
Maybe just a minute feel no pain
Oh-oh! I walk the line
Black the sky
(Black the sky)
Oh-oh! I walk the line
Black the sky
(Black the sky)
Ok so I don't think like
You do it's not my fault
Ok I still try to find
That fitting missing part
Just one day, just one second
Maybe just a minute feel no pain
Oh-oh! I walk the line
Black the sky
(Black the sky)
Oh-oh! I walk the line
Black the sky
(Black the sky)
Something keeps me hanging round
I guess my mother made me strong
Crawling thru this jungle from
This puzzle I come from
Just one day, just one second
Maybe just a minute feel no pain
Oh-oh! I walk the line
Black the sky
(Black the sky)
Oh-oh! I walk the line
Black the sky
(Black the sky)
Oh-oh! I walk the line
Black the sky
(Black the sky)
Black the sky
