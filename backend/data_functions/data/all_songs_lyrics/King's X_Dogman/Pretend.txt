Pretend LyricsYou took away from me I tried to get it back
And if you lie to me I keep it to myself
A trick or treat but then that don't make it right
I can't remember when I could say goodnite
Then something comes into my head and then a change
I work it out somehow I guess I've got my ways
But then I wonder how did I get it wrong
It doesn't matter now
I pretend
I pretend
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I take the longest walks they always do me good
I just indulge myself in sorrow singing blues
But then I have to laugh 'cause it's an outlet too
And if I add it all it still just wouldn't do
I've come to realize there's nothing I can lose
So I control myself, nothing else to do
I'll just remember when it comes around again
I'd rather be alone, I won't get hurt again
I pretend
I pretend
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Then something comes into my head and then a change
I work it out somehow I guess I've got my ways
I take the longest walks it always does me good
I just control myself
I pretend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I pretend
Yeah, yeah
I pretend
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I pretend
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I pretend
I take the longest walk
