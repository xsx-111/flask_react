Pillow LyricsI walked thru the door and took a seat
Listening to words
That seem to bounce right off my chest
Like I heard it all before
Teach an old dog the same old trick
Tide underside my pillow
Willow thundering
I ate the crumbs and I spilled the wine
The thought that counts
Burning candles shining in the light
Shining
Tide underside my pillow
Willow thundering
Tide underside my pillow
Willow thundering
I walked thru the door and took a seat
Listening to words
That seem to bounce right off my chest
Like I heard it all before
Teach an old dog the same old trick
Tide underside my pillow
Willow thundering
Tide underside my pillow
Willow thundering
Tide underside my pillow
Willow thundering
Yeah
Tide underside my pillow
Willow thunderingEmbed
