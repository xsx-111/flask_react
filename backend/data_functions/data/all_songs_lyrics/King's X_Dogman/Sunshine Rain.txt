Sunshine Rain LyricsThere's a thorn in my side
And I feel like I'm standing
In the middle of a battlefield
Oh lord I try
I-I-I walk thru sunshine rain
I-I-I, in every forest there's a snake
And the apple of my eye
The pain it comes and goes
I always let myself down
How does the letting go
It's just that way
I-I-I walk thru sunshine rain
I-I-I, in every forest there's a snake
And the apple of my eye
It takes time a friend of mine
Who's fallen down a million times told me
Told me!
Feelings never go away
You have to learn to live this way
And keep yourself alive
That's what he said
Oh, yeah
I-I-I walk thru sunshine rain
I-I-I, in every forest there's a snake
And the apple of my eye
I-I-I walk thru sunshine rain
I-I-I, in every forest there's a snake
And the apple of my eye
I-I-I walk thru sunshine rain
Oh, every forest has a... oh
And the apple of my eyeEmbed
