Flies and Blue Skies LyricsThere's a thought in my mind
And there's nothing not far behind
There's a road, there's a path
There's a freeway and there's a map
There are flies and blue skies
And the just and the unjust all walk
Side by side
Side by side
There's a fog in my mind
And there's nothing not far behind
There is wrong, oh, there is right
There is peace and there's a fight
There is life, there is death
And the difference between either one
Is one single breath, yeah-yeah
There are flies, oh, and blue skies
And the just and the unjust all walk
Side by side, oh-oh
Side by side
There are flies, yeah-yeah, and blue skies
And the just and the unjust all walk
Side by side
Side by sideEmbed
