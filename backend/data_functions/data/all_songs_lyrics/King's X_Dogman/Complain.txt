Complain LyricsOzone disappearing in the sky
Bud man asking us why ask why
If I could find my magazine this bug would die
I complain
China boy standing up to a tank
Southern boy living in the house of yanks
If I can't seem to get my motorbike to crank
I complain
Complain, so much easier
Complain, so much easier
Complain, so much easier, easier
Small kid begging for a crumb of bread
Next kid bloated lying nearly dead
I wonder what to take for my aching head
I complain
Lots of people crying for a little rain
Whole nation learning how to live with pain
I don't know how I'm gonna clean this little stain
I complain
Complain, so much easier
I Complain, so much easier
Complain, so much easier
Complain, so much easier
I complain, so much easier
Complain, so much easier
Complain, complain
Black man singing Mississippi blues
Africa starves a little baby drools
I'm trying to figure out all the basketball rules
I complain
Mr. Rush Limbaugh giving me the facts
Treetops falling and the newsman yaks
I'm thinking about Carter and how I'm gonna be taxed
I...
Complain, so much easier
I complain, so much easier
Complain, so much easier
Complain, so much easier
I complain, so much easier
Complain, so much easier
Complain, complainEmbed
