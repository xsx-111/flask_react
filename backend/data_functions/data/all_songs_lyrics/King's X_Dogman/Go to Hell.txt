Go to Hell LyricsI don't wanna go to hell
Nobody in their right mind wants to
But very few have done the things they have to do
To get to the promised land
I don't wanna go to hell
Nobody in their right mind wants to
But very few have done the things they have to do
To get to the promised land
I don't wanna go to hell
Nobody in their right mind wants to
But very few have done the things they have to doEmbed
