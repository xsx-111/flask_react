Joan of Arc LyricsLittle Catholic girl is falling in love
A face on a page, gift from above
She should have known better than to give her heart
She should have known better than to ever part
Without me
Without me
I gave her everything that I ever owned
I think she understood but she never spoke
She should have not tried to be that way
She shouldn't have to go there ever again
Without me
Without me
Now listen to us good, and listen well
Listen to the song, everything we tell
We should have known better than to give her away
We should have known better to this very day
Without me
Without me
Listen, Joan of Arc, all you got to do
Say the right words and I'll be coming through
Hold you in my arms and take you right away
Now she's on her away to another land
We never understood why she gave her hand
She shouldn't ought to promise, cause it's just pretend
I know she doesn't mean it and she'll leave again
Without me
Without me
Without me
Without meEmbed
