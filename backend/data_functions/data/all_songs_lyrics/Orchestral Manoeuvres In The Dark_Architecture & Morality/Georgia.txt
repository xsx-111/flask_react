Georgia LyricsWell, here we are again
Too, too good to be friends
Forever, forever, forever
Well, look at what we've done
Three, three rolled into one
Together, together, together
So, how can this be true
We, we thought that we knew you
Forever, forever, forever
We will watch the morning star
Rising home over Georgia
Dancing in the ruins of the western world
Blindfolds on and we don't careEmbed
