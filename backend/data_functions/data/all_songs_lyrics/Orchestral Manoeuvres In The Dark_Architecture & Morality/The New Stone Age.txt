The New Stone Age LyricsThis is the room
This is the wall
This is the body
I've been hoping for
These are the words
I've been longing just to say
So this is my goal
The aim of my life
This is the feeling
They warned me about
Oh my God
What have I done this time
Oh my God
What have I done this time
The think that you've done
You don't understand
The feeling the longing
The failing that's gone
(Real heart stop in
The arms to be
Everything shouting
In the new stone age)
Oh my God
What have we done this time
Oh my God
What have I done this time
(We'll start living
In the real stone age)Embed
