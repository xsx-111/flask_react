Souvenir Lyrics
It's my direction, it's my proposal
It's so hard it's leading me astray
My obsession, it's my creation
You'll understand it's not important now

All I need is co-ordination
I can't imagine my destination
My intention ask my opinion
But no excuse, my feelings still remain

My feelings still remain2Embed
