Bug Eyes Lyrics
Bring back those good old days
Nothing feels right, nothing ever goes my way
I threw my future away
Now I'll walk alone, out here in the cold
Wandering astray
Where's my future?
Gonna need a home
You'd expect the same, now, wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you?

Your journey back to birth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you
Your departure from the Earth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you

Only those who accept
Will find that acceptance in return
We have been trimmed down like hedges
Told just to sit and wilt and spit at each other from a distance
With constant resistance from you
Gonna need a home
You'd expect the same, now, wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you?
Your journey back to birth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you
Your departure from the Earth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you

It's been ten years strong
That's much too long
It's time to do something good for my health
Time to do something good for myself
It's been ten years strong
That's much too long
It's time to do something good for my health
Time to do something good for myself
I've wasted all of this time
I've wasted all of this time

Your journey back to birth
It's haunting you
It's haunting you
Your departure from the Earth
It's haunting you
It's haunting you6Embed
