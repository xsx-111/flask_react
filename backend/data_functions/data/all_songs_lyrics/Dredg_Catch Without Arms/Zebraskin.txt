Zebraskin LyricsI wonder
Why I'm running around again
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
Yeah I wonder
Like sprinting on a frozen pond
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
A couple of drinks mid-day, mid-day, mid-day
Haven't felt this way, this way since yesterday
A couple of drinks I sway, I sway, I sway
I haven't felt this way since yesterday
I wonder
Why I'm running around again
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
Yeah I wonder
Like sprinting on a frozen pond
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
A couple of drinks
A couple of drinks mid-day, mid-day, mid-day
Haven't felt this way, this way since yesterday
Beginning to sink and fade and fade and fade
There's nothing that I would trade to feel this way
I wonder
Why I'm running around again
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
Yeah I wonder
Like sprinting on a frozen pond
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
A couple of drinks
I wonder
Why I'm running around again
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
Yeah I wonder
Like sprinting on a frozen pond
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
I wonder
Running around again
I wonder
May have lost my best friend
I wonder
Running around again
I wonder
May have found my best friend1Embed
