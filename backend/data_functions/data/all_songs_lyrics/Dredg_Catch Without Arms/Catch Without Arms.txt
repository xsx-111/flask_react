Catch Without Arms LyricsI'm not your star
I'm not that beam of light
Here to save your life
To make your wallet fat
While mine's on a diet
It's not my greatest care
But simple needs are scarce
It's never ending
It really seems unfair
But lately I don't care
I don't care about much
I've given up trying
So sing about love
Sing about lust
So they will care
It's the same difference
That's what happens
When you play catch without arms
It's what sets, sets, sets us apart
Well that's what happens
When you compromise your art
It's what set, set, set us apart
We've got this far
I don't know if you care
But I think that you should swear
Or something of the sorts
Show me you're trying !
So sing about love
Sing about lust
So they will care
It's the same difference
That's what happens
When you play catch without arms
It's what sets, sets, sets us apart
Well that's what happens
When you compromise your art
It's what set, set, set us apart
Set the faith so they will find it
If there's a hope they can't deny it
Sing about lust so they can feel it
Sing about love so they can sing it
Sing it
Well that's what happens
When you play catch without arms
It's what sets, sets, sets us apart
Well that's what happens
When you compromise your art
It's what set, set, set us apart
I'm not your star
I'm not that beam of light
Here to save your life
