Hungover on a Tuesday LyricsSo long to the hurt and stormy weather
It's time for a cleansing
Nice try, but you can't avoid this forever
You know it makes you feel good
Feeding on your soul
You'll search for a cure
You'll want to be sure
You don't lose control
You'll want to be sure
That this is really you
So long since I can even remember
It's time for renewal
You know that you won't have fun after
You know it makes you feel good
Feeding on your soul
You'll search for a cure
You'll want to be sure
You don't lose control
You'll want to be sure
That this is really you
Fell towards the fire
But shielded myself from sin
Things are looking brighter
This is the way I want to live
So long to the hurt and stormy weather
It's time for a cleansing
Nice try, but you can't control me forever
Feeding on your soul
You'll search for a cure
You'll want to be sure
You don't lose control
I'll always be sure
You'll want to be sure
So long to the end
You'll always be there
But you are gone to me1Embed
