Spitshine LyricsI harmonize with a million screaming laughs
That haunted those before us
Preaching symphonies while the chorus yelled: "Unity"
It's based on facts
It's based on facts
You spit-shined my corroded halo
Then packaged it away
You spit-shined my corroded halo
Then left it to decay
"Will you watch your step
The boring story's left"
"You're feeling lost in here", she said
"Come in here, the pain won't last"
You spit-shined my corroded halo
Then packaged it away
You spit-shined my corroded halo
Then left it to decay
Take this weight off my shoulders
And move it to my brain
You spit-shined my corroded halo
Then packaged it away
You spit-shined my corroded halo
Then left it to decay1Embed
