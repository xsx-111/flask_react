Jamais Vu LyricsI looked to the sky
Saw my body die
Got to reappear up there
It's where I want to be
In the university
I've found, I've found
My own college
I've found, I've found
A way to resolve this
I'm not inside you
You're all around me
Is this what you needed to hear to comfort you
I will wait all this time above you
Is this what you wanted
Is this what you needed to hear
Take all that I've known
Is this what you wanted
Is this what you need me to fear
Take all that I've found
I'm not inside you
You're all around me
Is this what you needed to hear to comfort you
I'll wait all this time above you
I looked to the ground
Was pleased with what I'd found
Got to reappear up here
It's where I'll always be
In the university
I've found, I've found
All my problems
I'm gone, I'm gone
I finally solved this
I'm not inside you
You're all around me
Is this what you needed to have to comfort you
I'll wait all this time above you1Embed
