Matroshka (The Ornament) LyricsI was looking down at you smiling up at me
For once I held you tight, but shadowed arms grabbed at me
Your head was in the clouds, now those clouds are in your head
It's when you needed me, so I listened to what you said
Look another year went by
They keep passing by
God damn I didn't even die
Too old and slow I've grown
Well I fought time, but lost
It was love like a callus you're scarred enough to be
Tough and immune, my body adapts you see
To all above my head and all below my feet
Know that's one freedom you'll never take from me
Look another year went by
They keep passing by
God damn I didn't even die
Too old and slow I've grown
Well I fought time, but lost
To criticize and judge
How did I end up here
With these standards I'm forced to love
Make me disappear
Hold tight
To criticize and judge
How did I end up here
With these standards I'm forced to love
Make me disappear
Hold tight
Look another year went by
Hold tight1Embed
