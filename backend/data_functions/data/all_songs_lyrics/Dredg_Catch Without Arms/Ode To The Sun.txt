Ode To The Sun LyricsIt's gone from light to gray
But I'll move those clouds away
Letting the sun shine through
In this ode to you
Let the demons have their place
If so it's angels you'll create
And disguised within the dark
Light will wait
My heart
I owe you my soul
Will you please accept
Please accept this honor
This is all for you
Transcend
We flip towards the sun
Wheels skidding on the road
A flowing sea of red
The whole city groans
My heart
I owe you my soul
Will you please accept
Please accept this honor
This is all for you
Transcend
Will you please accept
Please accept it's over
This is all for you
Transcend
Fiasco
Rubberneck
Passing motorists
A mangled tuna-can-car rests
Repair this tattered skin
Hold it in your hand
You've already glistened through the window
You've already set us all
Free
Free
Please accept
Please accept this honor
This is all for you
Transcend
Will you please accept
Please accept it's over
This is all for you
Transcend
