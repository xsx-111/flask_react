Uplifting News Channel Lyrics
I watched the hawk land
A sign of good fortune
I watched it reaching out for my hand, it said
"You should revert back to the way you used to be
You know it will only help you in the end"
It's not an issue to let it in
Settle down
Settle down

Save your stories because they're all the same
You've had your glory, throw it all away
If you don't you'll never change because
Give it time and watch your fame decay
You're not alone
I've straightened out crooked lines
I did it on my own, got it done
I served my time
It's gonna take more you know
Settle down
Lay it down, lay

It's gone away, gone
It's gone away
All worries
No pleasure
In hope of the ultimate treasure
This is how our status is measured
This isn't pleasure
