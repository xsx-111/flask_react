The Tanbark Is Hot Lava LyricsThe old returns
While the new can bore
Cause you're the one who fell
Into a self created hell
We've worn it out
It took time to realize
It's a chore to recognize
What your world could take
It's overgrown
Take it all away now
Real soon we'll take this
All the way down
The old returns
While the new can bore
Cause you're the one who fell
Into a self created hell
There is no way out
When you build a stubborn shell
That shields from any help
We've worn it out
You tried to maximize
But it came as no surprise
You hurled a stake
To your own dome
Take it all away now
Real soon we'll take this
All the way down
Please
Don't
Go
Stay
The old returns
While the new can bore
Cause you're the one who fell
Into a self created hell
There is no way out
When you build a stubborn shell
That shields from any help
The old returns
While the new can bore
Cause you're the one who fell
Into a self created hell
Take it all away now
There is no way out
There is no way out
When you build a stubborn shell
That shields from any help
We've worn it out
We've worn it out1Embed
