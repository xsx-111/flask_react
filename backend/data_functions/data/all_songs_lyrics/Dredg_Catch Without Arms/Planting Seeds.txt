Planting Seeds LyricsShe's to blame, I'll erase routine
With a spark to ignite the flame
And in this struggle of guilt to tame
It's freedom I'll obtain
She tied me up, removed my crown
Bittered all good taste
I'm sorry for everything I've done
I can't deny instinct
Look what I have found
A seashell in a sea of shells
I'm good at planting my own seeds
To sprout an endless hell
It's dark like Poe
Forgiveness came, we embrace the key
Found water to douse the flame
We ended our difference of soul and brain
Forever we are changed
I've just set out on a brand new race
Can we keep the pace
I can't believe what we've become
I'll leave without a trace
Look what I have found
A seashell in a sea of shells
I'm good at planting my own seeds
To sprout endless hell
It's dark like Poe
Leave without a trace
I'll leave without a trace1Embed
