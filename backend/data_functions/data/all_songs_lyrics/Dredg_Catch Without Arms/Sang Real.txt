Sang Real LyricsI'm the addict on the corner
I'm the lawyer in the tower
I'm the body with the coroner
No, the leader with all the power
You're the pillow, the cool side
The sand during high tide
The cocktail, poolside
The water when clouds collide
From the inside out we were formed
And from the inside out we will fall
Soon this all will come to an end
I'm a local but a foreigner
Still the addict yet I'm sober
Still the body with the coroner
Many friends yet still a loner
You're the pillow, the cool side
The sand during high tide
The cocktail, poolside
The water when clouds collide
From the inside out we were formed
And from the inside out we will fall
Soon this all will come to an end
Soon this all will come to an end1Embed
