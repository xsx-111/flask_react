Not That Simple LyricsRemove my hands and feet
Watch me crawl on my stubs
Throw me to the streets
Watch me fall on down head first
It's not that simple
I've needed this from the start
To guide my way
You'll be okay
It's made life simple
I've needed this from the start to wake up
If all else fails
If all turns to dust
Set sail on a ship built from trust
If all else fails
And all starts to rust
Set sail on a ship built for us
It's time to retreat
I sawed it down to the bone
The canyons are too deep yeah
Decided to run like a child
Decided to run to rescue
It took too long to wake up
If all else fails
If all turns to dust
Set sail on a ship built from trust
If all else fails
And all starts to rust
Set sail on a ship built for us
It's not that simple
Needed this from the start
To guide my way
You'll be okay
It's made life simple
I've needed this from the start to wake up
If all else fails
If all turns to dust
Set sail on a ship built from trust
If all else fails
And all starts to rust
Set sail on a ship built for us
For us
For us1Embed
