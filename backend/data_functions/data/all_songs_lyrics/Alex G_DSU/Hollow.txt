Hollow LyricsDon't take a trip
Don't let me down
I know
I'm hollow
Keep my pinwheel
Spinnin' 'round
Swallow this-
You made a big
Mistake
Go away
Don't talk too much
You'll hurt yourself
I know
I'm hollow
Flush the fish
It can't be helped
I know him
I know how much
He wants
To stay
Don't take a trip
Don't let me down
I know
I'm hollowEmbed
