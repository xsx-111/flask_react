Boy LyricsStray dog is walkin' down the street
Next to another dog
They're eating mud and
Starting to smell me
Two babies
Dangerous and free
When I got home I told my baby
The story
She said to me
"I think you're funny, you saw
What you wanted to see"
And I said
"I am not the boy you knew"
"I am not the boy you knew"
"I am not the boy you knew"
"I am not the boy"
Feel like a million eyes on me
Feel like a cannon ball I see
A tree, it loses all its leaves
And you are dead to me
You watch someone you know
Grow into static company
And now you see
Do you wish you were?
"I am not the boy you knew"Embed
