Soaker LyricsAll I want to do is get a little bit closer to you
But you, you're like glue
I'm like water and you're like glue
And all I ever do is soak through you
All I want to do is get a little bit closer to you
But you, you're like glue
I'm like water and you're like glue
I'm like water and you're like glue
And all I ever do is soak through youEmbed
