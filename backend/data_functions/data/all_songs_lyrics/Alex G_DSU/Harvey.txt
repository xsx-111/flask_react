Harvey LyricsSuccess for my buddies, success for my friends
Success is the only thing I understand
Head back home to the place I grew up
Give my medals to the ones that I love
I'll chase Harvey through the door in the wall
He says, "never catch me, never miss me at all"
Drool comes down from the corner of his mouth
I say, "I love you Harvey, you cut it out"
I love winning, baby, I want it all
I wanna prove that I got the balls
Harvey keeps on playing with his food
He doesn't understand what big boys do
He wakes up in the middle of the night
I run in and turn on the light
Run my hands through his short black hair
I love you, Harvey, I don't care2Embed
