Black Hair LyricsBlack hair, it's swimming in my head
Black hair, it's bigger than death
Black hair, don't leave me in the dirt
Black hair, I'll show you what I'm worth
It's not what you are
It's just what you did
Don't hang up the phone
I love you to death
Eternal return
Eternal return
Eternal return
Eternal return
Black hair, it's swimming in my head
Black hair, it's bigger than death
Black hair is melting in the sun
Black hair, just look at what you've doneEmbed
