Icehead LyricsBird got caught in a wire
Don't fly
Bad man can't grow a hole
All right
Girl pecks hole for a life
Spits white
Boy lives mouth off a wire
Spits white
Ice went straight to my head
I said
Blood went straight to my head
I said
Fuck too fast, made it back
I said
Drift, don't jump on the bed
