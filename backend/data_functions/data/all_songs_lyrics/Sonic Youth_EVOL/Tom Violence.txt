Tom Violence Lyrics
My violence is a dream, a "real dream"
A skinny arm, a crush on living sin
My violence is a sleeping head
Nodding out to rising bliss
I left home for experience
Carved "Suck for Honesty" on my chest
My violence is the number
Coming out of prayer
Find it in the father
Find it in a girl

There's a thing in my memory
Holding on for dear life
With a feeling of secrets
Beating up under my flesh
My tongue is tied
I'm sleeping nights awake
Tom Violence is a dream
Coming out of a girl2Embed
