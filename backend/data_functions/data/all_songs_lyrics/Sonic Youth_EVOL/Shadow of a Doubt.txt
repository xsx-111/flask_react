Shadow of a Doubt Lyrics
Met a stranger on a train
He bumped right into me
Swear I didn't mean it
Swear it wasn't meant to be
Must've been a dream
From a thousand years ago
I swear I didn't mean it
Swear it wasn't meant to be
From the bottom of my heart
He was looking all over me
You take me and I'll take you
You kill him and I'll kill her
Swear it wasn't meant to be
Swear I didn't mean it
Kiss me
Kiss me in the shadow of
Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt
Kiss me
Kiss me in the shadow of
Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt

Must've been a dream
It's just a dream I had (No, no, no)
Swear it was just a dream
Just a dream (Swear it wasn't meant to be)
Dream I had
No, no, no, no (Swear, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Didn't do it, didn't do it
Maybe, maybe (No)
It's just a dream
Just a dream
It's just a
Just a
No
Met a stranger on a train
He bumped right into me
Swear I didn't mean it
Swear it wasn't meant to be
Must've been a dream
From a thousand years ago
Kiss me
Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt
Kiss me1Embed
