Bubblegum Lyrics
Here comes baby, are you ready for her?

Her name is Bubblegum
Live for moon and sun
Young and so much fun, life's just be-
Life has just begun

Your name is Bubblegum
Live for moon and sun
Young and so much fun, life's just be-
Life has just begun
Hit it, girls


Ahh, for the last time now
Here it comes

Her name is Bubblegum
Live for moon and sun
Young and so much fun, life's just be-
Life has just begun
Bubblegum, yeah!
Oh yeah! (barking)Embed
