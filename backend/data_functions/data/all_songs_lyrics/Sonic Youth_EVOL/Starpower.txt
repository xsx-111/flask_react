Starpower Lyrics
Spinning dreams with angel wings
Torn blue jeans, a foolish grin
Burning down in the night
So cool, so right
Star power, star power
Star power over me
She knows how to make love to me
She knows how to make love

Close my eyes and think of you
Everything turns black to blue
Star power, star power
Star power over me

Burning down in the night
Super cool, it's alright
She knows how to make love to me
She knows how to make love

Close my mind when I think of you
Everything turns black to blue
Star power, star power
Star power over me1Embed
