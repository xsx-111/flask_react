Secret Girl Lyrics

My mother used to say
"You're the boy that can enjoy invisibility"
I'm the boy that can enjoy invisibility
Close your eyes, make a wish
Cross yourself, see yourself
Feel yourself, scream once more
Move yourself, across the floor
Burn inside, between two walls
The advertisement's saying
The pleasure's everlasting
Come and touch me
The advertisement's saying
The pleasure's everlasting
Must be dead and gone to heaven
Come and touch me here
So I know that I'm not there1Embed
