Marilyn Moore Lyrics
Hey
Hey


Sound asleep 'til night, 'til day
Frustrated desire turns you away
And turns you insane over and over
You get to a point to make it disappear
And you're always believing
And believing in fear
Over and over and over and over
And over and over, over again
Marilyn Moore

She's always a headache
The size of a tow truck
She's full of disorders
Depends what you're used to
She's talking of trances
Of truncheons in battle
Of bruises from bottles
That never get better
Bad baby bitching she screams at the door
Hammer in hand and head to the floor
Marilyn MooreEmbed
