Stand by Your Gun Lyrics
I wouldn't recommend what I have done
Oh the prophets pointed out where I went wrong
Singing woohoo, go figure out your desire
Ooo, my darling, stand by your gun

See we don't need
No nothing more
We're quite attached to the forty-four
Take a chance
Take our words
We fall down, we go there, we go anywhere, woohoo oo

My mistakes land like embers on your tongue
In the foreground, you're still busy getting young
Singing woohoo, go figure out your desire
Ooo, my darling, stand by your gun

See we don't need
No nothing more
We're quite attached to the forty-four
Take a chance
Take our words
We fall down, we go there, we go anywhere, singing
Woohoo, go figure out your desire
Ooo, my darling, stand by your gun

See we don't need
No nothing more
We're quite attached to the forty-four
Take a chance
Take our words
We fall down, we go there, we go anywhere, Woohoo oo
Oo ooo ooo
Oo ooo ooo
Oo ooo ooo

Waste your time, on lessons learnt
How long will you go, will you go, will you go, and
Waste your time, on lessons learnt
How long will you go, will you go, will you go, and
Waste your time, on lessons learnt
How long will you go, will you go, will you go, and
Waste your time, on lessons learnt
How long will you go, will you go, will you go, and3Embed
