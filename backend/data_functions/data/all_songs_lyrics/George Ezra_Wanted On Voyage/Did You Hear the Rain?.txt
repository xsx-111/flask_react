Did You Hear the Rain? Lyrics
Oh, did you hear the thunder
Or the rain?
Means I'm coming home again
Means I'm coming home, my friend
Oh, did you steal my name?
Oh, you jack of all trades
You're the master of none
Oh, the race has begun
I was born a champion
I was born to jump and run

Oh, did you hear the rain?
Oh, the rain, woo
You can try and run and hide
Tearing at the chain
Oh, Lucifer's inside

Oh, did your siblings tell you
I was wastin' up your time?
Oh, now you're wastin' mine
You put me back in line
And I'm countin' every link
And I guess you think that's fine
Oh, did you hear the rain?
Oh, the rain, woo
You can try and run and hide
Tearing at the chain
Oh, Lucifer's inside

Oh, did I send a shiver
Down your spine?
Well, I do it all the time
It's a little trick of mine
Did I make you shake your knees?
Did I make him spill his wine?
Lord, I'm spreadin' like disease
Lord, I'm all up in your mind
Oh, Lucifer's inside
Oh, Lucifer's inside

Oh, did you hear the rain?
Oh, the rain, woo
You can try and run and hide
Tearing at the chain
Means I'm coming home again
Means I'm coming home, my friend
Oh, Lucifer's inside
Oh, Lucifer's inside
Lucifer's inside11Embed
