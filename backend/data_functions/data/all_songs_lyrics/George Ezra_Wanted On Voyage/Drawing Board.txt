Drawing Board Lyrics
I fill your pillow case up with snakes
The man eating kind
Though you call your self a woman
I doubt it they would mind
Oh my, oh
Oh my
There's just one problem with my plan
You spend your nights with another man
No you don't rest your head with mine no more
I've gotta take my plot back to the drawing board
Oh my, oh
Oh, my
Oh, my, my

Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I've a desperate plan in hand
So I'm a blue-print in the sand
Oh my

You mentioned taking a holiday
And I recalled you couldn't swim
So I booked us scuba diving
Off the North coast of Belgium
Oh my
Oh my
And I drew an image in my head
Of you sinking just like lead
But I never found you washed up on the shore
I've gotta take my plot back to the drawing board
Oh my, oh
Oh, oh, my
Oh, my, my

Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I've a desperate plan in hand
So I'm a blue-print in the sand
Oh my

Oh, I'm the one you seldom came to see
Oh, I was hidden
Oh, I've been busy working on my scheme
Oh, to teach you how to hurt

You said you needed a haircut
I recommended Mr. Todd
Of all the men in this big bad world
He's perfect for the job
Oh my, oh
Oh, oh, my
Oh, my, my
Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I've a desperate plan in hand
So I'm a blue-print in the sand
Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I've a desperate plan in hand
So I'm a blue-print in the sand

Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
And I haven't seen you since
So now I'm praying that you're mince
Oh my4Embed
