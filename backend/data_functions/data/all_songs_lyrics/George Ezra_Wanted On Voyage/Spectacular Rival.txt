Spectacular Rival LyricsViolence in the air, cutthroat stares
We're just window shopping
Won't you dance with me?
I'm gonna knock you down
Have you after hours
Too many sherbet dips, you'll get licked
If you carry on this way
Beautiful punchbag
I'm gonna lay you down
Just call me Mr. Brown
I'm not that kind of man in the day
Won't you hold me steady spectacular rival?
And I've had my medicine
Although you're not my friend
I love you 'till the end
Either way
Heaven's got a place for me
Your majesty
Why you got it in for me?
Either way
Heaven's got a place for me
Your majesty
Why you got it in for me?
Either way
Heaven's got a place for me
Your majesty
Why you got it in for me?
Either way
Heaven's got a place for me
Your majesty
Why you got it in for me?2Embed
