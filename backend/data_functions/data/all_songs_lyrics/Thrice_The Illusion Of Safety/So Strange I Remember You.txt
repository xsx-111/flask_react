So Strange I Remember You LyricsSo strange I remember you in protest of a prayer
And falling back from seas we fear to sail
I swear I saw the shooter, gold teeth and a double dare
Postmodern warnings seem inclined to fail
Feigning an apology
Those words they never left your lips
Those five years in Bermuda
Slide by like the lights of passing ships
So strange that I remember you
Knee deep in Nietzsche's lies
My throat was an open grave
I drank your stained glass eyes
And they taste like dead cathedrals
That are crumbling beneath their weight
Ten thousand jaded tourists
Who've traded in their hearts and hands for
Disposable cameras, set to document decay
Set to capture just enough of life
To catalogue the things we throw away
(...breathing the fumes of our machines...)
We've lost our way
(...breathing through television dreams...)
If we could only see us now
If we could only see us now
The words of the dead ring in our ears
But it's only a lie
The voice in your head brings you to tears
But you don't know why
The words of the dead ring in our ears
But it's only a lie
The voice in your head brings you to tears
But it's only a lie
Yes, it's only a lie
...isn't it?1Embed
