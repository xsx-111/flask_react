Kill Me Quickly LyricsCan we
Can we kill each other quickly?
Quick enough so I won't feel it?
A shot of strobe light anesthesia
And I'll be fine
As I'm beginning to feel cold
My hands are shaking from fear
White from clutching my pride
Red from cutting you
And blue from telling lies
Cause I'm sick of the stabbing
I'm sick of the breaking
I'm sick of the bleeding until we fall down
Sick of this circle of death that we dance through
Again and again, just lay me in the ground
Let's fall asleep together
Hold me darling cause I'm scared
And I can't do this alone
But I need
Your heartbeat
To haunt me
Your cold lips to breathe
A promise that tomorrow
We'll wake up somewhere newEmbed
