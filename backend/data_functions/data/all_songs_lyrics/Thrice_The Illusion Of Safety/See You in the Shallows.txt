See You in the Shallows LyricsI hear the waves crash far below
The rocks are leaping for the sky
They're starving for the air, for a bone to break
A dream to smash apart, but I don't care
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
This cliff has been well worn by ignorance
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
They float face down they all look so content
I don't know why I'm even here
Guess I'm afraid to be alone
And down below I see my crew they look okay
That can't be blood, the water here is far too blue
And gravity seems far away
But I can hear her call my name
It's so comforting to know I'll never have to think again
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
This cliff has been well worn by ignorance
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
We float face down, and don't we look content?
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
This cliff has been well worn by ignorance
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
We float face down, and don't we all look so content?
It looks deep enough from here
It looks deep enough from hereEmbed
