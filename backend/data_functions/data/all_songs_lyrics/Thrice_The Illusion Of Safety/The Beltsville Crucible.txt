The Beltsville Crucible Lyrics
True friends stab you in the front
Keep you from getting what you want
When one more fix could kill you
They help you realize that

You're more and less than you first had believed
You've so much to give and there's so much you need
Shortcuts through graveyards and a brand new way to breathe
Three thousand miles just to learn

All that's gold does not all shine
And helping words aren't always kind
When one more kiss could kill you
They help you realize that

You're more and less than you first had believed
You've so much to give and there's so much you need
Shortcuts through graveyards and a brand new way to breathe
Three thousand miles just to learn

How to let my guard down
Accept the fire has spread among us
And if you're feeling all right
You've got to play it again
You've got to play it again2Embed
