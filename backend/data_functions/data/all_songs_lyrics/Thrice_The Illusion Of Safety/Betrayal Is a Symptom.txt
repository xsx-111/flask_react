Betrayal Is a Symptom LyricsFaith
Is not something that I grasp
It's something that I fake
As I'm slipping, as I'm falling through the cracks
Faith
Without actions is a mask
For making the same mistakes
As I'm slipping as I'm falling through the cracks
Somehow I find beauty in our failings
Somehow I find meaning in these lies
Somehow I'm made perfect in this fracture
Your back is begging sweetly for my knives
I'm spilling blood
Glancing down to hide my face
I walk with eyes closed tight through monuments of grace
Somehow I find beauty in our failings
Somehow I find meaning in these lies
Somehow I'm made perfect in this fracture
Your back is begging sweetly for my knives!
My faith is a front, I'm spilling blood
Glancing down to hide my face, I walk with eyes closed
Through monuments of grace, I'm spilling blood
Glancing down to hide my face I walk with eyes closed
Through monuments of grace
Isn't it sweet how
Trusted with angels
And how so quickly
I break my promises?
Isn't it sweet?
Isn't it sweet?
Isn't it sweet?
Isn't it sweet?Embed
