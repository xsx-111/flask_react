Deadbolt Lyrics
When deadbolts awake you from déjà vu dreams
At four in the morning you know where I'll be
Out running red lights asleep at the wheel
The sirens feed my nightmares

I just close my eyes and I'm already here
It's already too late
I know it's nothing but lies
But they sound so sincere
I find them too hard to hate

And she calls from the doorway:
"Stolen water is sweet
So let's drink it in the darkness
If you know what I mean"
And she calls from the doorway
"Stolen water is sweet
So let's drink it in the darkness
If you know what I mean"

And I'm almost sure
That I've been here before
That this is not the first time
I've stood in front of this door
With an overwhelming feeling that I shouldn't go in
But it seems this is a battle that I never could win
And you
My true love
You call from the hilltop
You call through the streets
"Darling don't you know
The water is poison"
And I say
"Come on and give me my poison"

What have I done? Is it too late to save
Me from this place, from the depths of the grave?
(WHAT HAVE I DONE?)
We all are those who thought we were brave
(WHAT HAVE I DONE?)
What have I done?Embed
