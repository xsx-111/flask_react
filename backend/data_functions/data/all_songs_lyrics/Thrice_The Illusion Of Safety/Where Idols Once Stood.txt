Where Idols Once Stood LyricsOur idols lay in ruins
We'd have saved them if we could
But we still choose to worship
The places where our idols stood
Still believing
They can save us
I've lived this way
Too long to turn back now
Presuppositions set in stone
This coffin sealed by my own pride
And though it seems the sun will shine
I'll draw the shades and stay inside
If we've learned anything at all
It's that the ghosts of idols
Will do just as well
We all see what we want to anyway, anyway
Some things are better left unsaid
You know what's at stake
Some things are better left unsaid
As long as we can keep it
In textbooks, then we'll be
Untouchable, untouchable
We hate to lie to children
But after all, it's all for their own good
For their own goodEmbed
