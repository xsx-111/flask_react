Starting a New Life Lyrics
When I hear that robin sing
Well, I know it's coming on spring
Ooh-wee, and we're starting a new life

I've been shovelling the snow away
Working hard for my pay
All I gotta say is we're starting a new life

We're gonna move
Way on down the line
Girl, we've been standing in one place
For too long a time
When I hear that robin song
Well, I know it won't be long
Frank, I know we belong
And we're starting a new life


We're gonna move
Move way on down the line
Girl, we've been standing in one place
For too long a time, yeah
And when
And when, and when I hear that robin song
Well, I know it won't be long
Frank, I know we belong
And we're starting a new life
And we're starting a new life
And we're starting a new life
And we're starting a new life1Embed
