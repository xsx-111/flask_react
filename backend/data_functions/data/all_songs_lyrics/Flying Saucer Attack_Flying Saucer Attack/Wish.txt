Wish Lyrics
When I go camping I  for the sun
But we shade away, scream to , we're only in the dark

I wish you were here, wish whole all along, wish I could change
I wish you were here, wish whole all along, wish I could change

Oh,  and   and cycling away the dark
I can't feel it coming, can't feel it to that we're rising 

I wish you were here, wish whole all along, wish I could change
I wish you were here, wish whole all along, wish I could changeEmbed
