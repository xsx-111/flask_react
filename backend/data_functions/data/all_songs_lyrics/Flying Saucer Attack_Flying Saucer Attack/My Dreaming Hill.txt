My Dreaming Hill Lyrics
Peace of tide, my heart and my mind are shining through the light
We still surrender for this spark
Echoes wave but we shadow then, a burning glistening sleep
We still surrender for this spark

Some way that time can leap, so where I can come home?
I walk around still on my dreaming hill
My dreaming hill, we're dreaming still

She can  but this one we taught dream to
While it apart from me
 which my heart wish to grow, to grow behind 
While it apart from me

So baby tiger, so where I can come home?
I walk around still on my dreaming hill
My dreaming hill, we're dreaming stillEmbed
