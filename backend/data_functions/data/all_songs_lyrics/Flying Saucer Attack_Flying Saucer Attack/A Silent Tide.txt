A Silent Tide Lyrics
You are everything
In the dream
I walk away
You are above the sky
In the dream
I fade away

Stay by my side
When mystery calls us
The silent tide
When mystery calls us
The silent tide

You are everything
In the dream
I walk away
You are above the sky
In the dream
I fade away

The silent tide
When mystery calls us
Stay by my side
When mystery calls us
The silent tideEmbed
