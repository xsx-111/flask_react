The Drowners Lyrics
Won't someone give me a gun?
Oh, well it's for my brother
Well, he writes the line wrote down my spine
It says, "Oh, do you believe in love there?"

So slow down, slow down, you're taking me over
And so we drown, sir, we drown, stop taking me over

Won't someone give me some fun?
And the skin flies all around us
We kiss in his room to a popular tune
Oh, real drowners

So slow down, slow down, you're taking me over
And so we drown, sir, we drown, stop taking me over
So slow down, slow down, you're taking me over
And so we drown, sir, we drown, stop taking me over
Stop taking me over, stop taking me over
Stop taking me over, stop taking me over, stop taking me overEmbed
