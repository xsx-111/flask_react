Make Me Dream Lyrics
With you
I saw
And I knew
All of my thoughts

Make me, make me dream
To hide my lies
Make me, make me dream
Inside

And I
I feel in the sky
Looks overhead
With sacred rain
In the
I see you in the cloud
Looking too cold 
With wind to blow 

Make me, make me dream
To hide my lies
Make me, make me dream
InsideEmbed
