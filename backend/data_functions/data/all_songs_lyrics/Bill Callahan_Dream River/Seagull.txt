Seagull LyricsA barroom may entice
A seagull like me
Right off the sea
Right off the sea
And into the barroom
The barroom
The barroom
Barroom, barroom!
And let go
Yeah let go of the trapeze
And melt the snow of dream river
Dream river
Dream river
River
River
I wonder if I'll ever wake up
I mean really wake up
Wake up and wake you too
First thing that I will do
I will wake you too
How long have I been gone?
How long have I been traveling?
How tired have I been?
How far have I got in circling?
In circling
In circling
With all the tolls we pay
We'll own the highway someday
With all the tolls we pay
We'll own the highway someday
And the weight of the world slips away
Slips away
And the seagull falls back on the seaEmbed
