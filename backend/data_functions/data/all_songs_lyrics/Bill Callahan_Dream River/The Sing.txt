The Sing LyricsDrinking while sleeping
Strangers unknowingly keep me company
In the hotel bar, looking out a window that isn't there
Looking at the carpet and the chairs
The only words I've said today are "beer" and "thank you"
Beer
Thank you
Beer
Thank you
Beer
Giving praise in a quiet way
Like a church
Like a church
Like a church
That's far away
I've got limitations like Marvin Gaye
Mortal joy is that way
Outside a train sings its whale song
To a long, long train long long gone
Then silence comes back alone
High as scaffolding
Until the wind finds something to ping
Or the pinging thing finds the wind
We're all looking for a body
Or a means to make one sing2Embed
