Javelin Unlanding LyricsYou looked like worldwide Armageddon
While you slept
You looked so peaceful
It scared me
Don't die just yet
And leave me
Alone alone alone
On this journey
Round the sun
Ohhh Javelin!
Ohhh Javelin!
Unlanding
Ohhh Javelin!
Ohhh Javelin!
Unlanding
Sometimes it's hard to know when to call it an evening
See as much as we can stand, stand till we stagger
Laying all twisted together and exposed
Like roots on a river bank
Bam bam bam!
The Earth off its axis
The first draft's in ashes
And smeared on our faces
Ohhh Javelin!
Ohhh Javelin!
Unlanding
Ohhh Javelin!
Ohhh Javelin!
