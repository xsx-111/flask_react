Small Plane LyricsYou used to take me up
I watched and learned how to fly
No navigation system
Beyond our eyes watching
I always went wrong in the same place
Where the river splits towards the sea
That couldn't possibly be you and me
Sometimes you sleep while I take us home
That's when I know we really have a home
I never like to land
Getting back up seems impossibly grand
We do it with ease
Danger, I never think of danger
I really am a lucky man
I really am a lucky man
Flying this small plane
I like it when I take the controls from you
And when you take the control from me
I really am a lucky man
I really am a lucky man
Flying this small plane
Eyes scan the path ahead
And all around3Embed
