Winter Road LyricsThe road is dangerous
Pretty and white
Tires spinning on snow
World spinning heavy and slow
And I'm headed home
Time itself means nothing
But time spent with you
A Donald Sutherland interview comes on
The truck radio
He apologizes to all he's loved and sired
Long shot of my face
I have learned
When things are beautiful
To just keep on
Just keep on
Ohhh
The blinding lights of the kingdom can make you weep
I have learned
When things are beautiful
To just keep on
Just keep on
Ohhh1Embed
