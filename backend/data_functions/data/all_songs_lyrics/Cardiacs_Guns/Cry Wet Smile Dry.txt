Cry Wet Smile Dry Lyrics
It is today couriers day
I have a letter to say
Pen is good for nothing do me in
This letter old letter is arrears
It shall stay to the post for years yeah
Till at what o'clock is ten clock strike?
Cry wet smile dry if you won't then say goodbye
It is not that
Tie 'em rope 'em brand 'em in the eye

And all we want to see's all that
It is remarkable
The streets be laid out by line
And to paved yeah

Until two o'clock after midnight
At what o'clock are you to bed?
I think yet that it is ten clock strike
This letter old letter is arrears
It shall stay to the post for years
This day is good for nothing
Do me in
How is the day of the month the year
The day the hour etcetera
That is some letter to me
Go brand them
In the eye
See 'em wet and cry
Making 'em smile dry
Cry Dixie hang 'em high
Brand 'em in the eye
Oh my! See 'em wet and cry
See 'em wet and cry

I am to tell some words that I know by heart
"Tie 'em rope 'em brand 'em in the eye
Cry all wet and smile dry"

I see 'em wet and cry
Making 'em smile smile dry
Cry Dixie hang 'em high
Brand 'em in the eye! Yeah!
Oh my! See 'em wet and cry
Making 'em smile dry! Yeah!
Cry Dixie hang 'em high
Brand 'em in the eye
What the fuck are you doing?Embed
