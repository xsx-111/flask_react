Signs Lyrics
Sleep them well all them dry bones
After we shot to his death
The horse and the rocking boy

Folded up like a dead balloon
All breathing not welcome
Ah kiss me I'm sore
Million eyes watching all but this
Worth a kiss on this phiz
All on this phiz and more

Oh my saviour create me to die alone
I'm what you flush I'm your children
Nursing a desire with poison
Mothering stray waifs with germs
All trying to kill them

Then sleep better and easy
Awaken all the guilties

Now come down here for all of us
And throw this off axis
Without trying too hard
Starry shake and awaken all the guilties
Protect the innocent lambs
Make we sleep better and easy
All his loss all not was
And where is his eyes?
Think on this you did not miss
Didn't know if your distress
Were short not everlasting

Sleep thee well better and easy
All this loss no what cost no more
No more the horse and the rocking boy
Million eyes watching all but this
Worth a kiss all on this phiz ah!
This is ah!
This is ah!
Plant me oh joy!
Oh my saviour create we all to die alone no

No more the horse and the rocking boy
No more the horse and the rocking boy
No more the horse and the rocking boy
No more the horse and the rocking boyEmbed
