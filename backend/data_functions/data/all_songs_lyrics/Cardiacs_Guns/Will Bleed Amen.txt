Will Bleed Amen LyricsSame thing everyone doing thee
And don't even know if it's been planned
They will attack and kill
Don't even think about it
Not one of us, not one of you
But two hundred thousand
Snapping at the arms of the big padded body with a black dog
Gags and fills out with sock
No longer heaven keen birdy swoop down to address its mess
Pretends its Jesus
Missed that chance to sing
Missed that only chance
Dying to snatch eden
Charm enough to choke
All gag and bleed with gusto
Will bleed amen
"Find no good no kind but find guilties of sins
Sufficient enough to hang an army"
In
So in
God save the past
So in it makes me nothing like these
So
Not out
Not sorry leaving me all not sorry I breathed
"They will attack and kill
Attack and kill they will
The where and the how I leave to you"
And in all this glory
Was high as ninety was high as say
Eats his words as they die in his mouth
Eats his words as they
Choke the tic as it grows
Catchy lays of its eggs in her turfy thrill
And lost them on her lawn
Wishing could brush them all aside
But still
So be it all lucky charm
Enough to choke
All bleed and all gag with gusto
Will bleed amenEmbed
