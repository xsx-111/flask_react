Sleep All Eyes Open Lyrics
You mistake you-self heavily
Will you this?
Is your master home?
Yes Sir!
Is it up?
No Sir! He sleep yet!
It come in ones how is it you are in bed yet

Suck bear daddy she stink all clean
Upon my soul upon her life
She dog a - sleep all eyes open
Prays all our own jelly as fear yeah!
Grizzle yeah oh and contain me
Grizzle oh yeah and contain me


Since you not go out
I shall go out nor I neither
That may dead if I lie you
She dog a - sleep all eyes open
Prays all our own jelly as fear yeah!
The sun rise on sun lie down
Upon my soul upon her life she dog
Asleep all eyes

I feel very very bloody complete
Says if I falls froggy squish
Hooray yeah! Oh! Hooray yeah-eah ah!
Hooray yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Hooray yeah!
Hooray yeah! Oh! Hooray yeah-eah ah!
Hooray yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Hooray yeah!
Hooray yeah! Oh! Hooray yeah-eah ah!
Hooray yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Hooray yeah!
Hooray yeah! Oh! Hooray yeah-eah ah!
Hooray yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Hooray yeah!Embed
