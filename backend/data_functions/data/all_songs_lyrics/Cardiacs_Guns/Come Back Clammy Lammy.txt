Come Back Clammy Lammy Lyrics
Dead you barmy you make it to heaven
Fancy drowning to death you barmy in
Half a fathom see red rim barnacle
Come back clammy he reek all lammy
He tear off all of his clothes and snap his hair
Suffer he stink, he reek all lamb

"Hi, 'tis me pal I come back clammy
I reek all lammy of half a fath
Saw red rim barnacle make it to heaven"
Fancy drowning to death you lamb you
Come back clammy you reek all lammy
Of half a fathom of stink and you dead

Make it to heaven red rim barmy you
Come back clammy you dead saw barnacle
Make it to heaven red rim barmy you

All soldiers together in World War One
Having a bit of a laugh on the Somme
My friend says, "Where's my dirty bottom gone?"
I says, "Blown of by a big bomb"
And he says, "I thought there was a bit of a stink pong"
All soldiers together in World War One
Having a bit of a laugh on the Somme
My friend says, "Where's my dirty bottom gone?"
I says, "Blown of by a big bomb"
And he says, "I thought there was a bit of a stink pong"
All soldiers together in World War One
Having a bit of a laugh on the Somme
Make it to heaven red rim barmy you

Dead and you make it up to heaven
Fancy starving to death you barnacle
In half a fathom of red rim barnacle
Come back clammy you dead you barnacle
Tear of all his clothes and snap his hair

It was your idea to have a crazy party
With all your new pals to enjoy a free feed
On your body and to make the birds stop singing
While they go pick your bones white as pale
All stench and stale to barter with a hammer and you

Come back clammy you dead saw barnacle
Make it to heaven red rim barmy you

"Hi, 'tis me pal I come back clammy
I reek all lammy in half a fathom
Of suffer and stink and clam and you"
Come back clammy you dead saw barnacle
Make it to heaven red rim barmy you
Dead saw barnacle make it to heaven
Come back clammy you red rim barmy you
Come back clammy you dead saw barnacle
Make it to heaven red rim barmy you...Embed
