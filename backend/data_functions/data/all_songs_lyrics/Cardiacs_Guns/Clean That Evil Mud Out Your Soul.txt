Clean That Evil Mud Out Your Soul Lyrics
Clean that evil mud out your soul
Sweet heaven save me from that candle
Burned it up it burned, it stank so strong
Of hell fire

Heaven can only know what unholy sights and sounds
All we innocent babes has made in them dens

All spawn of my own flesh and blood
All spawn of my devils own strumpet
Them olden days and them hard times

And merciful heaven only knows
What unholy sights and sounds
All we innocent babes has made in them dens

Weren't you afeared little lambs down there
In all that dark down there
In that deep place made all flesh all blood
For these eyes of mine
What a joy divine
Merciful heaven only knows
What unholy sights and sounds
All we innocent babes has made in them dens

Weren't you afeared little lambs down there
In all that dark down there
In that deep place made all flesh all blood
For these eyes of mine
What a joy divineEmbed
