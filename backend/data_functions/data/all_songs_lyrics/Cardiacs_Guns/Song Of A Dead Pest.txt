Song Of A Dead Pest Lyrics
Mandy trained up her head to
Away itself go when is told
Head revealed its whereabouts
In a thicket by calling "here... I'm here!"

And in tones of deep solemnity
Pronounced that she is dead
Said she had left her torso
Too excited to listen and naked

Love gone lost of all faith in
Divine intervention flying birds on a string
Lowest neck down half of she
Scandalously flies her hawks
Outside my house

She'll only go if I address her coffin
As the ship whereon she must launch
Out into eternity
And renounce all dancing
Renounce loose living
And cricketEmbed
