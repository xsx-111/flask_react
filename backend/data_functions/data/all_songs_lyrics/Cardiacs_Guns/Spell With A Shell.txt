Spell With A Shell LyricsIt carried its home on its back
When it came
Saying he was for me a spell
Could be good could be bad
Soak him in some water
And it will be good
Or wear him as a shirt for week
And call him by a name
But bad if I burn him
(Ahhh)
Don't stop now
I didn't know you'd be growing wings
This is how long you'll stay alive
Don't! Stop it!
You're my only friend yeah
(Ahhh)
Right, so now I give your name "Baz"
How does that sound?
How is it so far?
Are you good to me yet?
Ohh. Oh. Mm
Or are you bad to me?
On a quiet night
Put him on the fire
There
There
Only because I don't want him to burn
Elsewhere
Oh don't stop now
I didn't know you'd be growing wings
This is how long you'll stay alive
Don't! Stop it!
You're my only friend yeah
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)Embed
