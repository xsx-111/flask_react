Secret Like Swans LyricsThink of them families souls
You're sending them to their deaths
Oh I can't see that well
It's just gloss
Dressing up like a princess in secret
Like swans
In secret, secret like swans
Swans
Can't suck marvellous marvels
Really have plan
In wide world
In wide world, in all the wide worldEmbed
