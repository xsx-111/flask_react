Wind And Rains Is Cold Lyrics
Wimping out for baby god
No grudge nothing not even fear
Only he was a lamb
Nursed his hate hand he cut it on a jag
Oh spotty Sallys army
All win they dared all sayed 'yeah'
Dashed back calling out alarms
Enough to wake the dead Freds
Dead Freds

With their hair waving all lazy and soft
Like meadow grass under the flood

Rains cold and the wind blows
All the rains is cold
All the rains is cold

Best thing gone did ever have
It was a good boy not bad
With whole body just a-quivering
With cleanliness
Hate hand take the soul through drizzle ditch
And the wormy vegetable garden bitch

Hide your hate hand in your secret place
Your hate hand hide your hand

Now you remember children
How blessed are the pure in heart
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Them dead good?

Like the only fish in the river
Not safe 'cos they all had stones
All had stones

With rains cold and the wind blows
All the rains is cold
Wind and rains is cold

Hide your hair it's waving all lazy and soft
Like meadow grass under the flood
Rains cold and the wind blows
All the rains is cold
Wind and rains is coldEmbed
