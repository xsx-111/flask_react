Reunion Lyrics
So long I've searched for you
So long but now it's true

Girl, it's our reunion, reunion
It's our reunion, reunion

I'm always here, I'm in your ear yeah
Love stereo, so don't you fear, don't fear

'Cause it's our reunion, reunion

Since last we loved, no one's come near
No girl can ever compare to you my dear
Girl, it's our reunion

Reunion, hoo, oh
Reunion
Reunion
Reunion (Reunion)
It's our reunion (Hey, oh)
It's our reunion (Reunion)
It's our reunion (It's our reunion)
It's our reunion (Oh oh yeah)
It's our reunion (Ooh oh oh oh oh oh)
It's our reunion (We're back together)
It's our reunion (We're back together, yeah)
It's our reunion (We're back together, yeah)
It's our reunion (We're back together, baby baby baby)
It's our reunion (Oh oh ooh)
It's our reunion1Embed
