The Suite Theme Lyrics
Yeah
Closer
Let's take some time
Sip your wine
That's it
Do you want mine, too?
Nice
Come on
Ooh, oh yeah, yes
Hey, hey
Sweet

Don't go away, baby
Don't go away, baby
Hang a while longer, darling
If you don't mind, I know
I know, darling
If you don't mind, darling
Then hang with me, baby
Ooh, hang with me, baby
Oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh, yes
Take your time
Keep hanging just a little while longer, baby
Keep hanging just a little while longer, baby
Keep hanging just a little while longer, baby

Don't go
Stay with me, okay?
Promise me you'll care for me
Promise that you'll marry meEmbed
