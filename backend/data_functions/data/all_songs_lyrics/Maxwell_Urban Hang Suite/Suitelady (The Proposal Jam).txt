Suitelady (The Proposal Jam) Lyrics
It's been so long since I have got you, lady
Since I have had your brown legs wrapped around me
The smell of she just drives me crazy
Imagine what the sight of her can do, woo

Suitelady, don't worry
Ain't no end to what this ring
Wants to begin with you
I've waited, suitelady
'Cause no man can tear asunder
What my love can groove

I never thought myself the kinda guy
The kinda man that would ever want to settle down
Statistics say it's crazy, passion won't survive
But something says (Nah) deep down deep down inside

Suitelady, don't worry
Ain't no end to what this ring
Wants to begin with you
(With this ring and what this ring will bring 'cause I)
I've waited, suitelady
'Cause no man can tear asunder (What my love)
What my love can groove
Love can groove
Me and you
Ah
Please, baby, background
Suitelady
Suitelady
Suitelady
Honey, honey, honey, yes
Oh, suitelady, yeah
I don't mean to be dramatic, baby
Said I, I only wanna understand you, baby
So will you marry me?

Suitelady, don't worry (Don't you worry, baby)
Ain't no end to what this ring
Wants to begin with you (No end, no end)
I've waited, suitelady
'Cause no man can tear asunder
What my love can groove
Suitelady, don't worry
Ain't no end to what this ring wants to begin with you
I've waited
'Cause no man can tear asunder
What my love can groove
