Whenever Wherever Whatever Lyrics
Lead me on, girl, if you must
Take my heart and my love
Take of me all that you want

And if there's a thing that you need
I'd give you the breath that I breathe
And if ever you yearn for the love in me

Whenever Wherever Whatever, baby
Whenever Wherever Whatever
Bye-bye, baby

Wish I knew if I could
Be the one that you would
Love forever and a day, baby, oh yeah

And if there's a thing that you need
For you and your blood I would bleed
And if ever you yearn for the love in me

Whenever Wherever Whatever, baby
Whenever Wherever Whatever
Bye-bye, baby
Bye-bye, baby
Bye-bye, baby
And if there's a thing that you need
I'd give you the breath...
And if ever you yearn for the love in me
Whenever Wherever Whatever, baby
Whenever Wherever Whatever, hoo-whoa-whoa, ooh1Embed
