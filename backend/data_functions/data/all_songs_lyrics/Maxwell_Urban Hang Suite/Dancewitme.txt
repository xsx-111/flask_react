Dancewitme Lyrics
One, two

Let me groove with you, mama
'Cause I can't take it any longer
Come on and dance with me, baby
Dance with me

I got my eyes on you
I watch the way you groove
You look so very cool
The way your body moves

Oh yeah, I like the way you shake your body all around
Oh, so damn glad you came but I just wanna get down, so

Let me groove with you, mama
'Cause I can't take it any longer
C'mon and dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Let me groove with you, mama
'Cause I can't take it any longer
Come on and dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
I got my eyes on you
I watch the way you groove

But don't you know that I like the way you shake your body all around?
I don't wanna play no games, I just wanna get down

Let me groove with you, mama (Let me, let me)
'Cause I can't take it any longer
Come on and dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Let me groove with you, mama
'Cause I can't take it any longer
Come on and dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Let me groove with you, mama
'Cause I can't take it any longer
Come on and dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Let me groove with you, mama
(I wanna dance, baby, I wanna dance with you)
'Cause I can't take it any longer (Oh yeah, baby)
Come on and dance with me, baby (I wanna dance)
Dance with me
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Let me groove with you, mamaEmbed
