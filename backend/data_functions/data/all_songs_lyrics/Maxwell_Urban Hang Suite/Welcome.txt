Welcome Lyrics
I guess it never was
The way I thought it was
I say this only just because
You never came to love
I guess it wasn't so
Guess that's how the story goes
You didn't dig my flow
You didn't dig my flow

But you're still welcome
(You're welcome babe, you're welcome to me)
Welcome
(Anytime you want, I'll always be free)
Anytime you want some
(You're welcome babe, you're welcome to me)
Make yourself at home cause you're welcome
Welcome

Tonight will make one week (ah yah do do da da do bah)
Tonight's the anniversary (ah yah do do da da do)
And if you don't talk to me (ah yah do do da da do bah)
Tomorrow will never be (ah yah do do da da do)
But you're still welcome
(You're welcome babe, you're welcome to me)
Welcome
(Anytime you want, I'll always be free)
Anytime you want some
(You're welcome babe, you're welcome to me)
Make yourself at home cause you're welcome
Welcome

Six in the morning everything's nothing
Six in the eve everything's still the same hey
Wish you knew I just wish that you knew that
(I really love you) deep like a mother loves a child
(I wanna love you) like water hot runnin' wild
(Inside you) Inside you momma sophisticated style
Check my dictionary


I guess it never was
(You're welcome babe, you're welcome to me)
The way I thought it was
(Anytime you want, I'll always be free)
I say this only just because
(You're welcome babe, you're welcome babe, you're welcome to me)
You never came to love
Welcome
(ah yah do do da da do bah)
(ah yah do do da da do)
Welcome
(ah yah do do da da do bah)
(ah yah do do da da do)1Embed
