Daddy Pop Lyrics
Oh Daddy
Oh Daddy
Oooh, sock it to me

See my brother talking plently head
Steady wishing he could sleep in your bed
Steady wishing he was in your car
Just a steady wishing that he was who you are

Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Brother steady talking while
The girlies steady hop
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Punching in the rock and roll clock (oh Daddy)

See all the people wonder why
You set your goals high - high as the sky
See the people running from the truth
Living in the past
When they need to be living the new

Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Brother steady talking while
The girlies steady hop
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Punching in the rock and roll clock (oh Daddy)
Pop - Daddy Pop
Pop - Punching in the rock and roll clock
Talk, guitar, talk
(Oh daddy)
Daddy Pop is the writer and love is the book
You better look it over before you overlook
One - Oh Daddy
Two - Oh yeah
Three - Ooo, sock it to me
Four - Oh (come on), your the best
See all my critics wasting time
Worrying about the Daddy while he beat you blind
Get your life together - stop your crying
Whenever you say that you can't -
That's when you need to be trying

Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Brother steady talking while
The girlies steady hop
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Punching in the rock and roll clock (oh Daddy)

What kind of fool is this, that thinks Daddy will miss
What kind of boy would dis, a list, as long as his-tory itself
I got grooves and grooves up on the shelf (oh daddy)
Deep purple concord jams (oh yeah)
This party I will slam (I don't think)
I don't think you understand (sock it to me)
Whatever you can't do - Daddy can
The one and only Daddy Pop
(Oh Daddy) One and only - Daddy Pop
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Brother steady talking while
The girlies steady hop
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Punching in the rock and roll clock (oh Daddy)

Poppa Daddy's coming
(Ring di di ding) somebody's calling
"The jester's on the phone!"
Oh yeah?
Rosie tell him I ain't home
He just one in a long line that wanna see me!
Daddy Pop

(Oh Daddy)
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
Daddy Pop (oh Daddy)
Daddy Pop (oh yeah)
Daddy Pop (oh Daddy)
Daddy Pop (oh yeah)

Daddy Pop lead the band
As I step to the mic and lend a hand (oh daddy)
To the funky groove, let's make the whole house move
Yo band let me hear you say ooooo ((ooooo)) (oh yeah)
That's right, we're gonna turn this mother out tonight
We ain't leaving till they (oh daddy)
Gonna have to turn off the lights
And if they do then what we gonna do?
((Trash it up cause we ain't through)) (oh yeah)
Yeah hit it, it's time to get with it, huh
I ain't no angel so to hell with playing innocent (oh daddy)
Those who came to party know just what I'm talking about
So come on y'all (oh yeah)
Wave your hand in the air, everybody
Wave your hand in the air (oh daddy)
For the funkiest band in the land and don't forget
The P-A-R-T-Y-M-A-N (oh yeah)
Peace (Daddy Pop) (oh daddy)
Yeah, peace (Daddy Pop) (oh yeah)
Like I said right about now (Daddy Pop) (oh daddy)
NPG is like aaaaaaaa (Daddy Pop) (oh yeah)
