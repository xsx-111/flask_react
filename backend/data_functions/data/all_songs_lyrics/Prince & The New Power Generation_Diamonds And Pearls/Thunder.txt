Thunder Lyrics
Thunder
All through the night
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light
Take my hand, it'll be alright
Come on save your soul tonight
Thunder

Love: nobody know just how it was born
Love: first came to me with the radio on
Jumped up in my body with an attitude
Kissed me on the mouth and said "Your leader take me to"

Thunder
All through the night
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light
Take my hand, it'll be alright
Come on save your soul tonight
Thunder

Love's kiss was running all through my veins
The bed started shaking, I don't know who to blame
Me or this flower right in front of my eyes
Is this my sweet savior or the devil in disguise
Thunder
All through the night
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light
Take my hand, it'll be alright
Come on save your soul tonight
Thunder

Like rain falling on a window pane
Tears came to my eyes when I asked her name
Made me holler when it finally came
Said "Only the children born of me will remain"

Thunder
All through the night
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light
Take my hand, it'll be alright
Come on save your soul tonight
Thunder

It will be all right (all right)
(It was truly like thunder)
Don't do it like that, do it like this
Oh oh (thunder) oh oh (thunder) oh oh
Thunder
Thunder
Thunder
(It was truly truly like)
Thunder
All through the night
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light
Take my hand, it'll be alright
Come on save your soul tonight
Thunder

Ooooo Thunder
Thunder, thunder
Yeah yeah yeah2Embed
