Live 4 Love Lyrics
Launch procedure commence
Countdown start
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4

Keep going
Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins...
30,000 feet and still-a-counting (live for love)
The attack on my plane is steadily mounting (live for love)
They killed my buddy, but i'm supposed to feel nothing (live for love)

How can i live for love? I'm calling...
Live for love
Live for love - I'm calling...
Live for love - I'm calling...
Live for love

Kicked out of my home at 17 (live for love) ((get outta here))
A real family
Now what does that mean (what does that mean) (live for love)
Don't nobody know the trouble I've seen (live for love)

How can i live for love? I'm calling...
Live for love
Live for love - I'm calling...
Live for love - I'm calling...
Live for love
My mission, so they said, was just to drop the bombs
Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins...
Just like I got no conscience, just like i got no qualms
Alpha 7, acknowledge
Now what does that mean?

Go Tommy go, go Tommy go
Go Tommy go, go Tommy go
Go Tommy go, go Tommy go
Go Tommy go, go Tommy go

So here, my target is approaching
The angel on my shoulder starts coaching
"Live for love, without love you don't live"
Boom - I take a deep breath
Is it boom - life?
Is it boom - death?
(Live for love)
Maybe I was better off staying in school (live for love)
But everybody said flying planes was cool (live for love)
It's so easy for them to say
Cause they never have to go through
How can I live for love? (live for love)
I'm calling
Live for  love -I'm calling
Live for love - I'm calling
Live for love
Live for love (live for love)
Live for love
Live for love

Damn, I got hit, but I still complete the mission (Live for love)
I flash upon my whole life just-a-steady wishing (Live for love)
The choice you make is vital
So at the end of my recital
I say - you got to live for love (live for love)
Keep going

Live for love
Live for love (Live for love)
(Live for love Live for love)
(Live for love), (Live for love)
Live (Live for love)

Live for love, without love u don't live
And how you make it is based on what you're giving back
In fact, only a few of us slip through the cracks
Through generations
The cards have always been stacked against us (Live for love)
To love each other is a must
If we just trust and cut the fuss
Believe me, unity is a must
Listen everybody, as I spread the word
Everything is hazy when your vision's blurred
I'm kicking reality in the streets of the city
There's this mentality what goes around comes around
And gank any clown who ain't down
With the colors that you're sporting around
Listen G, you are supposed to be
Striving to be the best that you can be
So stop trying to dominate and push and shove (Live for love)
Come on y'all, we got to live for love (live for love)
Live for love
Live for love
Live for love
Live for love
Live for love
Live for love
Live for loveEmbed
