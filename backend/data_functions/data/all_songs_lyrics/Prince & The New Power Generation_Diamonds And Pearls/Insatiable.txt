Insatiable Lyrics
Turn the lights off, strike a candle
No one that I've ever, knows how to handle my body
The way you truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes to you
I got a Jones, Martha
Oh yeah, it be like this
(I can't have a hug)
I can't have a hug
(Unless)
Unless I have a kiss

My body, baby, you truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes to you

Like a wildcat, Martha, in a celibate rage
I want you alone in my dirty little cage
Can you understand, Martha?

My body, baby, you truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes to you

Tonight we video
No one will ever know
We'll erase the naughty bits
I'll show my---
If you show your---
I can't help it, Martha
I can't help what you do to me
You are my every fantasy
There's no telling how far I'd go
Cause when it comes to you, i know
I'm insatiable and I just can't stop
Even if I wasn't thirsty
I would drink every drop

Please, baby, don't say no
'Cause I''ll surely go crazy
Ok, so all you do is push the little red button...
And i belong to you in your little video box
Hey - don't look at the clock, yeah
It's 2:45, we got all night
First you gotta tell me what you want me to do

My body, baby, you truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes to you

There's no telling how far I'd go
Cause when it comes to you, I know
I'm insatiable and I just can't stop
Even if I wasn't thirsty
I would drink every drop
So take it slow baby, and let's unwind
Do you really want all my clothes off?
(Yes)
What are you gonna do to prove it?
Aren't you afraid we're gonna be found out?
Well, let's get on with the shoutin'
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down lower)
Doesn't my body look good in the shadows?
Baby knows what to do
Have you done this before?
(I don't know)
You say you want my hips up in the air?
(Yeah)
I don't know, I don't care

(My body, baby, you truly do)
I knew i could be nasty with you
(Up and down, just like a seesaw)
(Back and forth)
(Back and forth)
Listen
(Oh girl, I'm falling)
I love you, baby
I love you baby, you're mine
You're nastier than I thought
It's just 2:49...2Embed
