Willing and Able Lyrics
Said I'm willing and I'm able
I'm ready to place my cards on the table
I've been holding back this feeling
For far too long
Now that I'm willing, it's a fact
Is truly mighty strong
Like a child lost in the wilderness
Till I reach my destination, I won't rest

'Cause I'm willing (Willing)
And i'm able (Able)
I'm ready to place my cards on the table (Table)

There's some kings in my deck and a queen or two
So you know there ain't nothing
Nothing that I wouldn't do (Nothing that I wouldn't do)
It was a long time coming
But now that It's here
All the non-believers better fear me

Cause I'm willing (Willing and able)
And I'm able
I got good and plenty cards
To place on the table (Table)
Been holding back this feeling for far too long
(Been holding back this feeling four far too long)
Now that I'm willing, (This feeling)
This feeling
It's truly mighty strong (Truly, I... I)
I'm willing (Willing)
And able (Able)
My vision is all clear, I'm feeling kinda stable
You know I am, you know I am
Ready to whisper (Whisper, what you say)
Ready to shout (Shout, now what you say)
Ready to scream (Scream, now what you say)
From the highest mountain top (What you say, what you say)
Lord, I'm willing and able
I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing

(Willing)
(Able)
(Willing and able)
(Willing and able)
I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing
(Dance and sing, let me watch you do your thing)
(Bring it to me)
Let me take a bite
To see if you're ripe
I'm kinda thinking about
Taking a hunk, chunk
A piece of your love tonight
Well hello, MC T. on a mellow
Swing low to the tempo
As I flow on a roll
Here we go, willing and able
Start the show right
With that type of hype
Lay my cards on the table tonight
Don't take me light
My flow hits you just like a lead pipe
While I'm clocking
You just say 'fess
About the boots i'm knocking
It ain't like that
(Something to keep the jimmy so get) off my back
In fact you lack the knack
Step back before I show you how a fool acts, baby
