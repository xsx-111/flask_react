Hard Times Lyrics
Well, I recall days in the city
And I think back, Oh what a pity
Remembering how it wasn't pretty
Every day life in the city
Out in the street we had to take it
With friends around, we couldn't fake it
What wasn't there, we had to make it
Hanging out down in the city

The hard times are dead and gone
But the hard times have made me strong
And the hard times have made me see
That the hard times ain't where I want to be

We had to fight to be accepted
It wasn't right and I protested
For hanging out we got arrested
Every day life in the city
We'd go to school and then we'd cut out
Go to the park and space our heads out
We called it fun but there was some doubt
Hangin out down in the city

I don't want to be there or even think back
I don't want to be there, now I'm on the right track, yeah


I don't want to be there or even think back
I don't want to be there, because I'm on the right track
Now I'm on the right track
I'm finally on the right track3Embed
