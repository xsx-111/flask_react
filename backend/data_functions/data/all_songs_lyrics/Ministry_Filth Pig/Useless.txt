Useless LyricsTell me what I want
What I need for all my sweating
Show me what I get
What I earned and why
Keep me all yours
Braindead and useless
Take my cues from the crippled many
A sickly view corrupt, without pity
The slogan's dream on greed and lust and power
Feeble, mis-sighted, without honor
The failing marriage slowly grinding into nothing
A bleeding union only left with trying offspring
Suffer, this simple nagging wound
This childish riddle, this dumb cartoon
Keep me all yours
Braindead and useless
Keep me all yours
Braindead and useless
These fucking , form aimless hands
Reaching for my throat to coddle, then throttle, remove all hope
Tried your best to choke the very meaning from my life
A callous whore, a cheating wife
Keep me all yours
(Useless, fucking useless)
Braindead and useless
(Useless, fucking useless)
Keep me all yours
(Useless, fucking useless)
Braindead and useless
(Useless, fucking useless)
(Useless, fucking useless)
Keep me all yours
(Useless, fucking useless)
(Useless, so fucking useless)
Keep me all yours
(Useless, fucking useless)
(Useless, you're fucking useless)
Keep me all yours
(Useless, fucking useless)
(Useless, so fucking useless)
Keep me all yours
(Useless, fucking useless)
(Useless, fucking useless)
(You're fucking useless)Embed
