Dead Guy LyricsAnother day, another knife in the back
It's happened so many times, I stopped tryin' to keep track
You're stuck stickin' it in, you're stuck stickin' it in
Take it up to the hilt to cover up your own fuckin' guilt
And when the shit goes down, you're out of places to hide
No time to ask, "Could the motherfucker really survive?"
Get a load of this fuck, he's the dead guy
It's just a knife to guts you never fuckin' possessed
You lost control of my life, you want control of the rest
You're always stickin' it in, you're always stickin' it in
You stuck it so many times you left a trail we defied
But when the shit comes down, you're out of places to hide
It's time to ask if you're alive or just forgot that you died
But just remember this fuck, I'm the dead guy
I'm the dead guy
