Game Show LyricsCutting pictures from a magazine
A paper smile but not from you to me
Another statue in a horoscope
A breakfast alone
Another compromising scene
Another game show
The game show
I pass the time away before I sleep
I have your picture sitting next to me
I taped your picture in a book
Don't bother reading, I just take a look
Don't have to turn the page before I know
So full of answers I don't need to know
Our life was just a joke
I like the game show
The game show
Don't have to turn the page before I know
You ask me questions, I already know
The time has finally come to let it go
Our life was just a joke
I love the game show
The game showEmbed
