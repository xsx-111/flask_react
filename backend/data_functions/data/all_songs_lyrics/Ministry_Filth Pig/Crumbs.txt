Crumbs LyricsYeah!
You're down to shooting blanks from broken guns
You fire all day long and still not hit a fucking one
Don't wanna know what some sick psycho fuck considers fun
You'd probably throw a party, serving melted ice cream over crumbs
Just crumbs
Just crumbs
You probably lick more ass than anyone
I guess you like the taste of shit on your tongue
No matter what you order, same thing will come
A plate of refried shit just covered in crumbs
Just crumbs
Just crumbs
