Filth Pig LyricsWell I started out younger at things that people start younger at
And a thousand days and nights of getting overexposed
Then someone asks, "How do you sleep at night?"
With the borrowed dreams from a broken past
You keep runnin' away don't matter how fast or long
You always wind up there
Another thousand pile-ups in the ugly name of morality
Fucking ugly, some creepy guy keeps asking
"How the fuck do you sleep at night?"
With a frozen dream and a borrowed hope that died

Filth pig, filth pig
Filth pig
I sleep with both eyes open
Filth pig, filth pig
Filth pig
I keep chasing this tail but the tail gets bigger go figure
A thousand more stories keep the fires and flames alive
So how the fuck do I dream at night?
With the memories of a borrowed death, the guilty past

Filth pig, filth pig
Filth pig
He sleeps with both eyes open
Filth pig
Filth pig, filth pig
Filth pig
He sleeps alright 'cause he's a
Filth pig, filth pig
Filth pigEmbed
