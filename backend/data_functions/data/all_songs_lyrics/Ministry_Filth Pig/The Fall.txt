The Fall LyricsTake this invitation
Bishop's queen to pawn
All of us were taken
All that was is gone
Of this information
Shames us one and all
Where's my compensation?
Watching others fall
Welcome to the fall
Everything is useless
Nothing works at all
Nothing ever matters
Welcome to the fall
Welcome to the fall
Welcome to the fall
