Reload Lyrics(Three... two... one... roll five.)

You got something to say
You better jump in my face
You got something to hide
'Cuz there ain't shit at your side

Aim

Reload

You say it's time to collect
I'll kick your ass and eject
It's time to settle the score
I'll show your ass to the door

Aim

Aim

You wanna lie like a dog
You're gonna wake up with fleas
Inside a world full of shit
You're still an asshole to me
