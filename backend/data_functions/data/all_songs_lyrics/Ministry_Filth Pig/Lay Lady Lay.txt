Lay Lady Lay LyricsLay lady lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay lady lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay
Stay while the night is still ahead
Stay lady stay
Heaven's dust fills our head
Whatever colors have you in your mind
I show them all to you and you see them shine
Stay lady stay
Stay with your man a while
'Til the break of day
Then you're gonna see him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you're the best thing he's ever seen
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing over you
Lay lady lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay
We're gonna build the whole night ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you all night
Lay lady lay
Lay lady lay
Lay lady lay
Lay lady lay
Lay lady lay2Embed
