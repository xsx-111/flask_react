Long Haired Child Lyrics
A mid-winter's day, it's cold
And I know for certain
When I go outside
My head'll start hurtin'
It's a winter's day
And I know for certain
When I go outside
My head'll start hurtin'

So I wrap it up in materials, to
Keep my head from getting cold
I'll wrap it up in materials to
Keep my hair from getting cold
And I said, tell my friends, when I have kids
Yeah, I said, tell my friends, when I have kids

I'm gonna want that child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child

When I go outside to mingle in the snow
My head look like a globe
Ain't no hair on it at all
Do I buy a wig?
Should I grow my beard?
And comb it upwards
And around my ears
Well, I can't wait for the kids to come
No, I can't wait for the kids to come
Say, "Hey babe, you go no-no barbershop"
â€˜Cause I want
Yeah, I want
Now I know for certain
I'mma want the child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child
That's for sure
Yeah, baby that's for sure

When the snow it hits my temple
I want to rush home
Put on the kettle now
And warm my little brain
And bald head
I'm too cold to know if I'm alive or dead

But when my baby slips out my mama's womb
When my baby slips out my mama's womb
We're gonna enter a new life
Enter a new life, that's for sure
You're gonna enter your self
Back through your baby's front door
Now if you want that baby to be a long-haired child
You're gonna make that baby be a long-haired child, that's for sure
Baby, baby, that's for sure
