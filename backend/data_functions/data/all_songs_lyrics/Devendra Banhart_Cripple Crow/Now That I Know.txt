Now That I Know LyricsNow that I know
The way it goes
You gotta pay back every penny that you owe
Twelve years old
In your mama's clothes
Shut the blinds and lock up every door
And if you hear
Someone's comin near
Just close your eyes and make them disappear now
Years away
Finds me here today
On my own, always on my way now
So I send my friends
Gifts from where I've been
Something for the hand they're never there to lend
Better keep those eyes
Climbing paradise
And don't pretend you won't reach it in the end now
Dearest dear
I know you been here
Why'd you run tell me why'd you disappear now
That you're not
Here with me
Seems to be the only time that I can see you clearly
I may not know
How to treat or give you what you need
But I am a gentleman who says what he means now
And now I sing
Upon my knees
And praise the kindness of a gentle breeze
I see it swell
Like a story in me to tell
Told years away and past my baby dying
So you raise them up
To heaven always hell
They're unaware, share, give a hand to help son
Oh you give them away
But they'll come back to you someday
Wanna know why nobody was ever there to help them
And no it ain't fair
And if God forbid you care
It's enough to get you in a whole lotta trouble
Oh realize
It ain't wise to idealize
Or put your life in the hands of any struggle
Never renounce
Or ever claim to be
And never buy that freedom just ain't free now
Ella sang
Sifting in the sand
Like a hymn within to help us understand
Heaven awaits
We're making our last stand
Glory bound and sparrow in our hand2Embed
