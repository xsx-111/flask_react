Hey Mama Wolf LyricsWhen I'm in the woods I know what to call you now
When I'm in the woods I know what to call you now
Hey Mama Wolf
Hey Mama Wolf
Well, maybe the mountains know what to call you now
Maybe the mountains know what to call you now
Hey Mama Wolf
Hey Mama Wolf
When I'm in a womb I know what to call you now
And when a belly blooms I know what to call you now
Hey Mama Wolf
Hey Mama Wolf
Well, I can say, Marie, I know what to call you now
Swimming in the sea, I know what to call you now
And when you swim with me I know what to call you now
And when you're under me I know what to call you now
Hey Mama Wolf
Hey Mama Wolf
Hey Mama Wolf
Hey Mama Wolf
Hey, hey, Mama Wolf...
Hey, hey, Mama Wolf...
Hey, hey, Mama Wolf...
Hey, hey, Mama Wolf...Embed
