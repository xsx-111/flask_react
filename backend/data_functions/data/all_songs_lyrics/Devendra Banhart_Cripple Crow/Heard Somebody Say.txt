Heard Somebody Say LyricsI heard somebody say
That the war ended today
But everybody knows it's goin' still
Our motherlands and motherseas
Here's what we believe
It's simple
We don't want to kill
I heard somebody say
That the war ended today
But everybody knows its goin' still
Our motherlands and motherseas
Here's what we believe
It's simple
We don't want to kill
Oh, it's simple
We don't want to kill
Oh, it's simple
We don't want to kill
Oh, it's simple1Embed
