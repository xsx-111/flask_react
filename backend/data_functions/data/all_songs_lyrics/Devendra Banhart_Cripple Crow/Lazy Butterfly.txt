Lazy Butterfly LyricsLazy butterfly, napping on me
Dreaming of the sky and roly polys
Wake up, wake up, clouds are coming, clouds are coming
Wake up, wake up, rains are falling, rains are falling
Colors in my eye are staring at me
Anchor at my side as sweet as silver
Pleasure, pleasure, don't forget her, don't forget her
Love her, love her, I won't forget her, I won't forget her
Seashell fingernail, scratching at me
Brown eyed lullaby singing at me
Come on, come on, try and catch me, try and catch me
Come on, come on, try and catch me, try and catch me
Cotton old cloud smoke, I know he feels it
Rising from an oak because I feel it
He burn, he burn, mesmerizing, mesmerizing
He burn, he burn, hypnotizing, hypnotizing
Hopeful wise old worm in his temple
Digging in the dirt staying simple
Married, married, to the desert, to the desert
Climbing, climbing, up a ladder, up a ladder
Purple hummingbird in the meadow
Suckling at the flow of its shadow
See the day fit your fist in, fit your fist in
It's never too late, I'd like to think so, I'd like to think so
Knife stuck in her paw someone help her
Gather sticks and straw and build it shelter
Don't you, don't you, let her die yeah, let her die yeahEmbed
