Canela Lyrics
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Don't the flower at your feet smell sweet
Well it sure smells sweet to me
Ooh
And don't the moon way up high shine bright
Well it sure shines bright to me
Ooh

And don't the water on your lips feel good
Well it sure feels good to me
Ooh
And don't the lips on your lips feel good
Well they sure feel good to me
Ooh

Ooh
