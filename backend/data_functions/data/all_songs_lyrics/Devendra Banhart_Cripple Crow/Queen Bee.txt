Queen Bee LyricsWell, I do like a certain girl
She moves like a dancing dream
I saw everything I've seen
And I meant everything I mean
Oh queen bee, you're always happy and free
Oh queen bee, land by me, by me
She's kissed everyone I've kissed
She's missed everyone I've missed
And her guess is always as good as mine
And I'm blessed, she treats me so damn kind
She's grown every seed I've grown
She's known everything I've known
And my dreams they always coincide
And how bows always float in time
And oh, queen bee, I'm always happy to see
Oh queen bee, sting me, sting me, sting me...Embed
