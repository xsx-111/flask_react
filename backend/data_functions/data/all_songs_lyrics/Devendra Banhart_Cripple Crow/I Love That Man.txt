I Love That Man LyricsI love that man when he's on stage
I hear bad things in a good way
And how I thank you all the time
So don't refuse this thank you of mine
And I arrive at your feet in peace
And I spend my time as I please
And I can't stop light from shining in
My goddamned breath keeps breathing
And at your end and your leaving
May you have no sin worth grieving
And I hope that I can someday ask
Something new to you at last
Now you talk, I'll pour
And our nearness grows
And when I'm bored, I'll let you know
This black ink cross that's on our palms
Let's keep them on
And never wash them off
It ain't for God, it's just for us
Once my friend but never again
And once we're in, we never endEmbed
