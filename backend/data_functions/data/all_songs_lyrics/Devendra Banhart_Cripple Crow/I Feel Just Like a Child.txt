I Feel Just Like a Child Lyrics
Okay, we're rolling again

Well I feel just like a child
Yeah, I feel just like a child
Well I feel just like a child
Well I feel just like a child
From my womb to my tomb
I guess I'll always be a child, now

Well, some people try and treat me like a man
Yeah, some people try and treat me like a man
Well, I guess they just don't understand
Yeah, some people try and treat me like a man
They think I know shit
But that's just it
I'm a child, now

Well, I need you to tell me what to wear
Yeah, I need you to help me comb my hair
Yeah, I need you to help me tie my shoes
Yeah, I need you to come keep me amused
From my cave to my grave
I guess I'll always be a child, now
Well, I need you to help me reach the door
And I need you to walk me to the store
And I need you to please explain the war
And I need you to heal me when I'm sore
You can tell by my smile
That I'm a child

And I need you to sit me on your lap
And I need you to make me take my nap
Could you first pull out a book, and
Read me some of that?
'Cause I need you to make me take my nap

And I need you to recognize my friends
'Cause they're there
Even though you don't see them
They got their own chair, a plate, and a seat
You know I won't touch my food
Unless they eat
From the roof, to the floor
I crawl around some more
I'm a child, yeah, uh-uh
And I need you to help me blow my nose
And I need you to help me count my toes
And I need you to help me put on my clothes
And I need you to hide it when it shows
From being my daddy's sperm
To being packed in an urn
I'm a child

And when I steal, you gotta smack me 'til I cry
Don't you stop 'til all the tears run dry
See, I was born thinking all under the sky
Didn't belong to a couple old white guys
From sucking on my mama's breast
To when they lay my soul to rest
I'm a child

Well, I'm a little child
Oh, I'm a little child
I guess I'll always be
A little child3Embed
