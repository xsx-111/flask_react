Korean Dogwood LyricsRed oak
Sugar
And Korean Dogwood
Vibes turn
To rubbed rum
Lit by mission moonlight
Kangas on that hillside
You are
My life
And you baffle me some
Like vanilla's maple
Inca Cornflower
You're my baby's blue eyes
And when your gown dissolves in a prayer
You'll hear a sound
That rings true and fair
Black King
Lightning
The dawn of Orange blossoms (and orange blossoms)
My friend
Keegan
Drawing endless love songs (endless love songs)
Calm breath
Sweet being
Show me what you're seeing (show me what you're seeing)
And though right and loud and proud
Every little word
It still ain't heard
Strange prayers
Looming
Over all our brothers (over all our brothers)
Prison life served
But Navajo Gospel
Is a rope thrown helpful
But for sure
All that we've made
Will be swallowed by the earth
For its got no worthEmbed
