Little Boys LyricsLife is tough and love is rough
For the man who just can't seem to ever get enough
The days go by and the women come and go
So many that you decide to get rid of your front door
So you don't have to hear them all disappear
You just sit and you wait
Staring at your empty plate
And you can say I'm a lonely sailor
Rockin' gently on my dreams
'Cause I have it all, but I don't want it all
It ain't like I've never ever ever ever tried
I just never been fully satisfied
Just a tie a little shoelace
And to share a sleeping bag
And I look ahead to the day
When I look back at all the fun that I've had
But still, but still, but still..
I see so many little boys I want to marry
I see plenty little kids I've yet to have
Even when the moon goes out
Even when the sea dries out
I still see so many little boys I want to marry
I see plenty little kids I've yet to have now
Even when the sea's all free
And everything's lying on me
Even when the sun ceases to shine
I won't care, I'll still have on my mind
So many little boys I want to marry yeah yeah
I see plenty little kids I've yet to have
And in the shower I get my dreaming done
I hold my breath and I wait for the day to come
Oh little Billy, little Timmy, little Jimmy, you're the one
I may not look it, but I swear my heart is young for so many..
Little boys I want to marryEmbed
