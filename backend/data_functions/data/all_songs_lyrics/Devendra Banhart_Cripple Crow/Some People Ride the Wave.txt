Some People Ride the Wave LyricsSome people ride the wave of generosity
Some people ride the wave of mediocrity
Me, I ride the wave of never gonna drown
Oh, just fooling around
Now I gots the balloons
And you, you gots the mud
And me I gots the snail
And you, you gots the stuff
Well you got so much more than I figured was in store
Oh, I ain't foolin no more
Now some people ride the cat when asleep or when awake
Some people ride a cat for riding a cat's sake
Me I ride this cat 'cause its claws have got my eyes
I'll get 'em back in a few more tries
Oh, I'll get 'em back in a few more tries
Some people write the books that tenderize their names
Some people write the books that bastardize our claims
Me, I write the book that's sifting in the sand
Aw, some day I'll understand
Aw, some day I'll understand
Some people write the songs that stay inside our souls
Some people write the songs that really ain't songs at all
Me, I write the song that ends right when it starts
They'll split before they part
Oh, they'll split before they partEmbed
