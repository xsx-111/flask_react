Chinese Children LyricsIf I lived in China I'd have some Chinese children
If I lived in China I'd have some Chinese children
Well out of my toes my little black baby grows
And that's my fact
Well if I lived in China, I'd have some Chinese children
Yeah if I lived in China, I'd have some Chinese children
Well if I lived in China, if I lived in China, uh huh
Well out of my ears my little black baby hears
And that's my fact
Now if I lived in Russia, I'd have some Chinese children
If I lived in Prussia, I'd have some Chinese children
Well if I lived in India, they'd still be Chinese children uh huh
And out my toes my little blue baby grows
And that's another fact
Now if I lived in Ireland, I'd have some Chinese children
Yeah if I lived in Ireland, I'd have some Chinese children
Yeah if I lived in Ireland, if I lived in Ireland, uh huh
Well if I lived in Spainland, they'd still be Chinese children
And if I lived in Greeceland, they'd still be Chinese children
But out of my thumbs my little red baby runs
And that's another fact, an unchanging fact
Now if I lived in my land, which I do, I'd still have Chinese children
And if I lived in Iceland, I'd still have Chinese children
Well if I lived in Greenland, I'd still have Chinese children uh huh
But out of my ears my little gray baby hears
And that's my fact
Well if I lived in Thailand, I'd have some Chinese children
Well if I lived in Japan, I'd still have Chinese children
If I lived in this land, if I lived in that land, uh huh
And up from my lungs and standing on my tongue
My little blue baby sung
Yeah if I lived in Brooklyn, I'd still have Chinese children
Yeah if I lived in Oakland, they'd still be Chinese children
Oh if I was an Injun yeah, if I was an Injun, uh huh
Whatever I do they're Chinese through and through, uh huh
Well I got Chinese childrenEmbed
