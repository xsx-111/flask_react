An Occasional Man Lyrics
I've got an island in the Pacific
And everything about it is terrific
I've got the sun to tan me
Palms to fan me
And an occasional man
I love my island, it's very lazy
If I should ever leave it I'd be crazy
I've got papayas, peaches, sandy beaches
And an occasional man

When I go swimming
I am always dressed in style
'Cause I go swimming
Wearing just a great big smile

My little island was made for pleasure
And in the cool of evening it's a treasure
And when the hours grow later what is greater than
An occasional man

My little island is such a beauty
You may forget to heed the call of duty
But if you give the slip
Take your ship
Miss the trip
Take a tip
And blame an occasional dameEmbed
