Cherokee Lyrics
Brave Indian warrior
Since first I met you
I can't forget you
Cherokee sweetheart
Child of the prairie
Your love keeps calling
My heart enthralling
You Cherokee

In the summertime
Of lover time gone by
From my memory
So tenderly inside

My brave Indian warrior
One day I'll hold you
In my arms hold you
My Cherokee


In the summertime
Of lover time gone by
From my memory
So tenderly inside
My brave Indian warrior
One day I'll hold you
In my arms I'll hold you
My CherokeeEmbed
