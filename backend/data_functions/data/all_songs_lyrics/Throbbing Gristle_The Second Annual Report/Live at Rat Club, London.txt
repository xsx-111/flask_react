Live at Rat Club, London LyricsI wanna see you better
I wanna do better
I don't need feelings anymore
Dead Ed, dead Ed, dead Ed
Thank you, Brian
Give us raw material
Give us raw material
Make it feel uncomfortable
Make it feel uncommendable
It's not easy
It's not just one pound thirty
It's not just one pound thirty
One pound thirty, one pound thirty, one pound thirtyEmbed
