Slug Bait (Live at the ICA, London) LyricsSlug bait
Can't wait
Slug, slug bait
Can't, can't wait
I crawl up the grass to your window
Then I open up your room very slow
Slug bait
Can't wait
I walk into your bedroom
And I look at you and your
Seven months pregnant womb
Slug bait
Can't, can't wait
I get your husband to your front bedroom
I cut his balls off with my knife (knife)
I make him eat them
In front of his pregnant wife (wife)
He chews his balls off
I look at him very slow
Slug, slug bait
Can't, can't wait
As he bleeds to death on the floor
I want you say "Don't do any more!"
Slug, slug bait
Can't, cannot, cannot wait
I look at your big bellied stomach
It's already moving a little bit with your baby
I use the carving knife from your kitchen
I start to perform the operation
You say "No, no, don't do that!"
I say, "I don't give a... cat's whiskers!"
Slug bait
Can't wait
I pull out your baby
I chew his hand off with my teeth
I lick him clean
It's obscene
As you bleed to death I kill it
I'm just a wicked boy
Slug, slug, bait, bait
Can't, can't, wait, wait
Slug, slug bait
Can't, can't wait
