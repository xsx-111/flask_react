Maggot Death (Studio Recording) LyricsPlay a tiny ruse
Play a little game
Play your little game
Without any name
Put a record on
Put a record on
Maggot death
Maggot death
Maggot death
Maggot death
Maggot death
Maggots loose
Bad for you
I walk your park
A walk in the park
Feel the same
Play for time
I see the wife every time
I see the white leather thights
I got an act you want
I tell you what to do
I'm gonna ask you home
I know just what to do
Maggot death
Maggot death
Maggot death
Maggot death
Maggot death
Maggot death
What did you want
Just a silly tart
You gotta go out now
Make you pay for death
Maggot death
Maggot death (just you)
You're just a lump in my bed
Eating up my headEmbed
