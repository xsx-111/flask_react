Live at Brighton Lyrics...Bizarre...
"Well, my first intentions were to rape her. When I started to, um... When I grabbed hold of her, the sexual borders, uh, disappeared. I just flipped right out and started strangling her and I potted her head against the stairs a number of times."
"How old was she?"
"She was ten."
"Was it, was it something you wanted to do to a child?"
"I was, uh, tired of sex, where it was the reasonable borders. I was trying to find someone older, but she was there and here to die."Embed
