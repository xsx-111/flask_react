Live at Brighton, Part 2 LyricsYou're a load of fucking wankers! Think of stuff to say and then say it instead of say-instead of sitting there, you little tits... Fucking load of fucking wankers who can't do any better! You've got nothing to say, the lot of you! You're just idiots, you know. You're so bloody ignorant, it's unbelievable.
Go on, go on! Anybody who... thinks they know what they're talking about- No, you're a load of fucking wankers, you really are!Embed
