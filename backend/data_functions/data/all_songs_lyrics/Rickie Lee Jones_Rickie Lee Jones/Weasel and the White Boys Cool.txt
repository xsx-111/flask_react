Weasel and the White Boys Cool Lyrics
Sal was working at Nyro's Nook in downtown
Selling articles of congress to these people downtown
He was pretty sleazy when I met him
A weasel in a poor boy's wool
A weasel in a poor boy's wool
A weasel in a poor boy's wool
Just like a weasel, yeah

Sal lives in a black vinyl pen in New Jersey
Buys his meat from a whore next door
He wants it rare but he gets it well
A weasel on a short order floor
A weasel on a short order floor
A weasel on a short order—
Like a weasel, yeah, yeah

So, Sal, say good-bye to your mom and your dad
Sal, say good-bye to the barrio
Sal, say good-bye to your buddies and your pals
Angela, Perry and Mario

A kid sinister with the bus stop blues
A quarter could take you home
A dime could make a dream come true
But a weasel ain't got a dime for the phone
Weasel ain't got a dime for the phone
Weasel ain't got a dime for the phone
Doesn't— weasel don't got a dime for the phone
So, Sal, say good-bye to your mom and your dad
Sal, say good-bye to the barrio
Sal, say good-bye to your buddies and your pals
Angela, Perry and Mario

You did the dancing in the welfare lines, Sal
Actin' like some jerk-off fool
When we could lay out eatin' peaches on the beaches
A weasel in a white boy's cool
A weasel in a white boy's cool
A— A weasel in a white, white boy's, baby, like this
Like we're all in a white boy's cool, cool
Like a weaselEmbed
