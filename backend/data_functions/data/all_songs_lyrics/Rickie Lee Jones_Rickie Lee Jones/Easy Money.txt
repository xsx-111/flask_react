Easy Money LyricsThere was a Joe
Leanin' on the back door
A couple Jills with their eyes on a couple bills
Their eyes was statin'
They was waitin'
To get their hands on some easy money
They flipped a dime
One said " well, I'll take heads this time"
One stepped up
One stepped back
One loosened her shoulder strap
She couldn't speak
Her knees got weak
She could almost taste that easy money
There was this old black cat
Sittin' in a old black cadillac
The Joe smelled sweet
She curled up at her boyfriend's feet
She said "I got a plan
Listen, Sam, how'd ya like to make some easy money ? "
He say, "yes! oh yes!
Jus' tell me what you want me to do "
She said, "Baby, you can trust me
Baby, but you must be hidin' in my room
At a quarter to two"
Well, the cat told the boy
"Come up to the room and play with my toy"
But the Jill set the bait
And she wasn't gonna sit around and wait
But this guy was wise to all the lies
And he flies out the door
With the easy money
Because there ain't no man
Who got the money in his hand
Who got any of that bread
Bein' slow in the head
The easier it looks
The hotter it hooks
There ain't no such thing as easy money
We say, "yes! oh yes!"
Saturday night
There was a terrible, terrible fight
Between two dames who was losin' the same game
It wasn't clear
But I hear somebody was lookin' for some easy moneyEmbed
