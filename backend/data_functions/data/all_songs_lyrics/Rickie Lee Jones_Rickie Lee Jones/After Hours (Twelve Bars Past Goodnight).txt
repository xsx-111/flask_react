After Hours (Twelve Bars Past Goodnight) Lyrics
All the gang has gone home
Standing on the corner
All alone

So you and me, streetlight
We'll paint the townâ€”grey
Oh, we are so many lamps
Who have lost our way

Say goodnight, America
Oh, the word still loves a dreamer

And all the gang has gone home
And I'm standing on the corner
All aloneEmbed
