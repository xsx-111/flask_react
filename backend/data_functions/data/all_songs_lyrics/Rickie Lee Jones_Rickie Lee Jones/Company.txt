Company Lyrics
I'll remember you too clearly
But I'll survive another day
Conversations to share
When there's no one there
I'll imagine what you'd say

I'll see you in another life now, baby
I'll free you in my dreams
But when I reach across the galaxy
I will miss your company

Company
I'll be looking for company
Look and listen
Through the years
Someday you may hear me
Still crying
I'm still crying
Crying for company
I'm still crying for company

So now you're going off to live your life
You say we'll meet each other now and then
But we'll never, never be the same, never
And I know I'll never have this chance again
Oh no no no, not like you, not like you
I'll see you in another life now, baby
I'll free you in my dreams
But when I reach across the galaxy
And I will someday
I will miss your company

Company
I'll be looking for company
Look and listen
Through the years
Someday you may hear me
Hear me still crying
I'm still crying
Crying for company
Listen to me
I'm still crying for company
Company
Oh, looking for companyEmbed
