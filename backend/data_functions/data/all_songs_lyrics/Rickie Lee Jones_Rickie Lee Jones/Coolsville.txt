Coolsville Lyrics
I and Braggar and Junior Lee
Well that's the way we always thought it would be
In the Winston lips of September
How we met
Decked out like aces
We'd beat anybody's bet
'Cause we was Coolsville
'Cause we was Coolsville

Well you stick it here
You stick it over there
But it never fits
And now a hungry night wants more and more
And you're chippyin' your little kiss
Well, I jumped all his jokers
But he trumped all my tricks
And I, I, I swear to God
I thought this one was smart enough
To stick it into Coolsville
And stick it into Coolsville
Ooh, Daddy, stick it into Coolsville

So now it's J&B and me
And that sounds close, but it ain't the same
Well, that's okay
Hot City don't hurt that much
But everything feels the same
Well the real thing come and the real thing go
Well the, the real thing is back in town
Ask me if you wanna know
The way to Coolsville
Well I hear you wanna go back to Coolsville
Well come on honey
Take you back to CoolsvilleEmbed
