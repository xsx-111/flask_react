Cool Love LyricsYou've been playing it cool
I've been playing a fool
Now don't you give me that cool love
Give me the kind I need
Let's start getting with it, baby
You're acting like a square to me
Well, love's gotta be warm
And love's gotta be right
And this ain't no ice cube
That you are with tonight
So don't you dish me out the cool love
It don't move me at all
And if you'd live it up, baby
Man, we'd really have a ball
You've been playing it cool
I've been playing a fool
Now don't you give me that cool love
Give me the kind I need
Let's start getting with it, baby
You're acting like a square to me
Now the clock is striking one
And we ain't had no fun
Just throw your arms around me
And the night has just begun
Now that's a little more like it
Now you're doing all right
And if you keep it up, baby
I'll see you tomorrow night
See you tomorrow night
See you tomorrow night
See ya! (Yeah!)Embed
