Mean, Mean Man LyricsI love a mean, mean man who lives uptown
When I want him most, he's not around
He's a mean, mean man, ooh Lordy, he's a mean, mean man
He's a mean, mean man, but I love him all I can
Now he can calls at seven, wants a date at eight
He's never on time, he's always late
He's a mean, mean man, ooo, well, he's a mean, mean man
He's a mean, mean man, but I love him all I can
Now we can go to a dance, he holds me tight
But then he don't even kiss me goodnight
He's a mean, mean man, ooh Lordy, he's a mean, mean man
He's a mean, mean man, but I love him all I can
I know I'm a fool to love that man
But I'm a-gonna love him as long as I can
He's a mean, mean man, ooh well, he's a mean, mean man
He's a mean, mean man, but I love him all I can
He's a mean, mean man, but I love him all I can
He's a mean, mean man, but I love him all I canEmbed
