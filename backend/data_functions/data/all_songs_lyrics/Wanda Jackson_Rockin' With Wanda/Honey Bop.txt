Honey Bop LyricsWell, once they had a dance they called the bunny-hop
Now the cats are in a trance, all they wanna do is bop
So bop, honey bop, well bop, honey bop
Oh bop, honey bop, well don't stop, honey bop
When the band begins to rock and it's rockin' to your blues
If you think you blow your top, well, put on your rockin' shoes
And bop, honey bop, well bop, honey bop
Let's bop, honey bop, don't stop, honey bop
When the night is up and gone, but you still wanna go
Though you see the light of dawn, baby, tell the band to blow
And bop, honey bop, well bop, honey bop
Well bop, honey bop, don't stop, honey bop
Well, the waltz is for the square and the rhumba is too old
Baby, we're just rockin', let it satisfy your soul
So bop, honey bop, well bop, honey bop
Oh bop, honey bop, don't stop, honey bop
Well, now you've heard the dance, they call the bunny-hop
But the cats are in a trance, all they wanna do is bop
So bop, honey bop, oh bop, honey bop
Well bop, honey bop, don't stop, a-bop-bop-bopEmbed
