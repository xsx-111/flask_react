Did You Miss Me? LyricsTell me, did you miss me while I was gone?
Did you wanna kiss me when you were alone?
Did you sit and stare at the telephone?
Did you miss me while I was gone?
Our love came so suddenly and still is so new
I just want to know if you feel like I do
Did you think about me while I was away?
And did every hour seem like a day?
Was there something inside that you just couldn't say?
Did you miss me while I was away?
Our love came so suddenly and still is so new
I just want to know if you feel like I do
Tell me, did you miss me while I was gone?
Did you wanna kiss me when you were alone?
Did you sit and stare at the telephone?
Did you miss me while I was gone?Embed
