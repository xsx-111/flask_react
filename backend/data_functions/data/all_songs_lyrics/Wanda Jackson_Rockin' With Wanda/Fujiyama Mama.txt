Fujiyama Mama LyricsI've been to Nagasaki, Hiroshima too!
The things I did to them, baby, I can do to you!
'Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama
And I'm just about to blow my top!
Fujiyama-yama, Fujiyama!
And when I start erupting
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop!
I drink a quart of sake, smoke dynamite!
I chase it with tobaccy and then shoot out the lights!
'Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama
And I'm just about to blow my top!
Fujiyama-yama, Fujiyama!
And when I start erupting
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop!
Well you can talk about me, say that I'm mean!
I'll blow your head off, baby, with nitroglycerine!
'Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama
And I'm just about to blow my top!
Fujiyama-yama, Fujiyama!
And when I start erupting
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop!
Well you can say I'm crazy, so deaf and dumb!
But I can cause destruction just like the atom bomb!
'Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama
And I'm just about to blow my top!
Fujiyama-yama, Fujiyama!
And when I start erupting
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop!
I drink a quart of sake, smoke dynamite!
I chase it with tobaccy and then shoot out the lights!
'Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama
And I'm just about to blow my top!
Fujiyama-yama, Fujiyama!
And when I start erupting
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop!Embed
