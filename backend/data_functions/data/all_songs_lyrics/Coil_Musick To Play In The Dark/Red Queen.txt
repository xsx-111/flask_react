Red Queen LyricsNow you've absorbed it into your system
Now that you've allowed it to be true
Now that you've neutralised it, made it safe, made it yours
Now that you've been photographed, recorded
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Is it so unsafe when you are
Insecure in the space where you are?
Is it so, really so
Is it more real?
Is it more yours?
Is it more yours?
Is it more real, for you
Than it is for him or me?
And the people who perceive it
Repeat it, distort it, improve it, update it
Slightly change it
And these people believe it
And write it all up for you
And is it more real?
And is it more real?
Does it make it more yours
Now you're recorded as having said it?
And being seen and done it
People have been seen to take notice
So empty
Is it so awful to be seen to feel and fail?
Overheard and noted to authenticate his story
An unsafe male trait
You know what they say
That empty vessels ring true, like bells
Make the most noise
The ink is still wet
In this case, the medium is not
Is it so unsafe when you are
Insecure in the space where you are?
Is it so, really so, unsafe you can't let
Let go?
Is it so unsafe when you are
Insecure in the space where you are?
What are you going to do if they don't believe you?
What are you going to do if they don't believe you?
What are you gonna do?
What are you going to do if they don't believe you?
What are you going to do if they don't believe you?
What are you going to do if they don't believe you?
What are you going to do if they don't believe you?1Embed
