Broccoli Lyrics
Wise words from the departing
Eat your greens, especially broccoli
Remember to say "thank you"
For the things you haven't earned
By working the soil
We cultivate the sky
Mmm, we embrace
The vegetable kingdom
The death of your father
The death of your mother
Is something you prepare for
All your life, all their lives

Wise words from the departing
The death of the mother, and the death of the father
Is something you prepare for
For all of their lives
For all of your life

Wise words from the departing
Eat your greens, especially broccoli
Wear sensible shoes
And always say "thank you"
Especially for the things
You never had
Wise words from the departing
By working the soil
We cultivate the sky
And enter the vegetable kingdom
Of our own heaven
By working the soil
By working the soil
We cultivate good manners
We used to say "please", and "thank you"
Especially for the things
We never had

Wise words from the departing:
Eat your greens, especially broccoli
And always say "thank you,"
Especially for broccoli2Embed
