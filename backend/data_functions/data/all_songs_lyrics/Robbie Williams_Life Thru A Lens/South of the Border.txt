South of the Border Lyrics
I know a freaky young lady name of Cocaine Katie
She makes my temperature freeze
She's got a blood red powder when she gives a shout
She'll bring you to your knees
Well we were being clever playing God games forever
She said she only meant to please
But I'm someone's brother, got a father and a mother
You know I'm going to have to leave

South of the border
I think you oughta
South of the border
I think you oughta
'Cause you know you're gonna have to leave
To a place where you can breathe
And you know there's no reprieve

There'll be tears on leaving but there won't be no grieving
'Cause a city soon forgets
To me it's magic, to the landlord it's tragic
He's got another room to let
There'll be the same old faces in the same old places
Where my youth was well misspent
But I tow the line and move the time
To a town called "No Regrets"
South of the border
I think you oughta
South of the border
I think you oughta
'Cause you know you're gonna have to leave
To a place where you can breathe
And you know there's no reprieve
'Cause you know you're gonna have to leave
To a place where you can breathe
And you know there's no reprieveEmbed
