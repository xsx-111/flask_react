Average B Side Lyrics
You say you're sick and tired
Of feeling sick and tired
I walked and told the truth
Do you wish I'd stayed alive?

'Cause she said that you said that I said
She said that I said, "The love's dead"
And I tried to explain
Don't expect you to be the same

On this rockin' roller coaster, an emotional ride
We were just an average B side
We were just an average B side

I watched the past run by
On the silver screen
We played our parts and died
Scene by scene

When she said that you said that I said
She said that I said, "The love's dead"
And I try to explain
Don't expect you to feel the same
On this rockin' roller coaster, an emotional ride
We were just an average B side, oh B side

Pretend you like me
Pretend I like you
Pretend, pretend, pretend
This is not happening

On rockin' roller coaster, an emotional ride
We were just an average B side
On rockin' roller coaster, an emotional ride
We were just an average B side
We were just an average B side
We were just an average B sideEmbed
