Better Days Lyrics
I'm gonna write you a letter
I think the sooner the better
'Cause the time is right to find a better day
I'm an angry young man
Man I wish I was young
My guitar is out of tune even that's highly strung
And the words we didn't say last night
Shook the world to the core
We had nothing to say last night
We'd said it all before
And I say

Lonely times and lonely tears
Will fade away when you disappear
The time is right for me to stray
I'm gonna find a better day

Kicking off 'cause it suits me
I'm gonna leave the country
And the time is right to find a better day
Making sense of my past now
I'll only love when I want to
'Cause the time is right to find a better day
Maybe I didn't love you
Maybe you loved her less
Would you have preferred it
If I'd have worn the dress
'Cause I say
Lonely times and lonely tears
Will fade away when you disappear
The time is right for me to stray
I'm gonna find a better day
Lonely times and lonely tears
Will fade away when you disappear
The time is right for me to stray
I'm gonna find a better day

Nowhere to run to baby
Nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run to baby
And nowhere to hideEmbed
