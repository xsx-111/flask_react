Walk This Sleigh Lyrics
Peace on earth see two old men
We're gonna get boozed up again
I'm an actor, pope, messiahs
Roastin' oats on open fires
Pushed to find three wise men
You definitely won't find a virgin
It ain't my rounds, so I'll be cheering

I believe in Christmas
What do you believe in
Mine is yours and yours is mine
I believe in Christmas time
Everybody's feeling fine
We believe in Christmas time
Mine is yours and yours is mine
I believe in Christmas time
Everybody's feeling fine
'Cause we believe in Christmas time

Happy birthday Jesus Christ
Here's the Spice Girls' merchandise
Got Christmas spirit without a doubt
Poor old Santa while he's out
I don't care if lords are leaping
I take a get to the back
While they are sleeping
And make sure that they won't be breathing
I believe in Christmas
What do you believe in
Mine is yours and yours is mine
I believe in Christmas time
Everybody's feeling fine
We believe in Christmas time
Mine is yours and yours is mine
I believe in Christmas time
Everybody's feeling fine
'Cause we believe in Christmas timeEmbed
