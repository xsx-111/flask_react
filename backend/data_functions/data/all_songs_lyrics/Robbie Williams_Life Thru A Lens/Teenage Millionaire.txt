Teenage Millionaire Lyrics
Hi out there. This is Shaun Goldberg and you're listening to W. A. N. K. This evening I've got someone really interesting. He's over from Old England and his name is... Robbie Williams
Cor blimey bleedin' Mary Poppins
Great, Right On, you know we've been hearing about this boy band that was really big over there. Can you tell us a little bit about it Robbie?
First of all, I'd like to say thank you very much for having me in the first place but to answer your question I can't really answer it, I suppose it was a bit like this

Riding in your limos
Hanging with your bimbos
Riding my old faithful
Bigger pin-up than Betty Grable
Kipper in the papers
Coke and whiskey chasers
I ain't supposed to boast

But I don't care
I was a teenage millionaire
A teenage millionaire
A teenage millionaire
Yeah, yeah

Services for Britain
Pouting like a kitten
Dinner with Diana
I'm a social Stokey spanner
Waiting for my knighthood
She can pin it on my manhood
I ain't supposed to boast
But I don't care
I was a teenage millionaire
A teenage millionaire
A teenage millionaire
Yeah, yeah
A teenage millionaire
(It works out sometimes it's funny
Being stupid makes you lots of money)

Bothered Judy Garland
When I buggered Barbara Cartland
Champagne in my bidet
The press all had a field day
You may think it's an outrage
My cleaners wearing bondage
She makes my place a mess

But I don't care
I was a teenage millionaire
A teenage millionaire
A teenage millionaire
Yeah, yeah
A teenage millionaire
Come on waif
It looks as if you need a good feedingEmbed
