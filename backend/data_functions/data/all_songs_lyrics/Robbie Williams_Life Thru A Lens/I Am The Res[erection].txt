I Am The Res Lyrics
Yoko's cutting keys in Soho
I've been there and I should know oh face it
I'll stick up for auntie Sally
Worzel's just a dirty scally fragrant
Mia farrow's patching marrows down at the place where all the face fit
Robin cousins doing dozens on a little pudding so he rakes it

I'm the resurrection
I may steal your soul
I am very evil
I live for rock and roll

Shirley Bassey's playing Lassie up a pole in Tallahassee hates it
Norris McWhirter's doing furters in a little place how's he fake it
It's another appetizer I can go and buy a tizer laced fit
I don't know where I've been but I know where I've been is near a lake

I'm an erection
I may steal your soul
I am very evil
I live for rock and roll
I am an erection
I may steal your soul
I am very evil
Only for rock and rollEmbed
