What I Wanted Lyrics
I turned my head away
Didn't wanna hear what you said
You had changed your mind

I showed up insecure
But I thought you would be sure
I guess I had lost sight

But at the end of my life, I'll look back on my life
And I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life, I'll look back on my life
And see I went after you like I should
I went after what I wanted
I went after what I wanted
And I never really got it
But it don't matter at all

But I guess it was a lot
To ask for these things we'd lost
I guess it was just a dream

And time changes many things
But my heart, it still sings
For you, I don't know why
But at the end of my life, I'll look back on my life
And I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life, I'll look back on my life
And see I went after you like I should
I went after what I wanted
I went after what I wanted
And I never really got it
But it don't matter at all (Ooh-oh)

I thought I'd spend my last days holdin' your hand
Now all of my senses lie here dead on the floor

But at the end of my life, I'll look back on my life
And I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life, I'll look back on my life (At the end of my life)
And see I went after you like I should (Yeah)
I went after what I wanted (Wanted)
I went after what I wanted (I wanted)
And I never really got it (I never really got it )
Everything else, I lost it (I)
I went after what I wanted (Ooh, you had to go your own way)
I went after what I wanted (And I had to go mine)
And the rest don't really matter
It don't matter at all
It don't matter at allEmbed
