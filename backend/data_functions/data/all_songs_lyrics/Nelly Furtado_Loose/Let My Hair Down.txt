Let My Hair Down Lyrics
I'm Nelly, I'm Nelly, I'm Nelly, I'm Nelly
If you want the video, I'm on your video
If you want the radio, I'm on your radio
Holla if you hear me, yo
I'm Nelly, I'm Nelly, I'm Nelly, I'm Nelly

Baby, I wanna let my hair down (Let it down)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (Let it down)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down
Play me something that'll make me jump around

Let's flow with this
Let's get to know with this
Let's hit the show with this
Let's fly like a crow with this
Do you wanna be my raven?
I could be your Star Maven
Or we could make a little haven
Tell me what you're cravin'
Let's make a dust bowl
We'll hit it like at the Rose Bowl
I do like sports
But I don't like wearin' shorts
It's okay, we can do it in the dark
If you got a candle, let's light a spark
Everybody looks good in good lighting
Hey, we could do it, we can close our fighting
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (Let it down)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (Let it down)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down
Play me something that'll make me jump around
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (Let it down)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (Let it down)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down
Play me something that'll make me jump around

It's Nelly on the mic
Feelin' alright
And you can have a bite
But not tonight
You can call me Nico
Gimme something to eat, oh
I heard you're chickety-chic-o
Like you're stay at the Rico
Yeah, you like my map
Yeah, it's all that
Let's start a frat
Gamma, Gamma, Gamma Phat
You know you like the vodka
You like the way we rock ya
Hey, I'm your amore
Come here, baby, wanna pour you something boring
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (Let it down)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (Let it down)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down
Play me something that'll make me jump around
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (Let it down)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (Let it down)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down
Play me something that'll make me jump around

This is my flow (My hair down)
This is my flow (My hair down, my hair down)
This is my flow (Jump around, my hair down)
This is my flow (My hair down, my hair down)
This is my flow (Jump around)

Baby, I wanna let my hair down
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (This is my flow)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down
Play me something that'll make me jump around (This is my flow)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down
Baby, I wanna let my hair down (This is my flow)
Baby, I wanna let my hair down
Play me something that'll make me jump aroundEmbed
