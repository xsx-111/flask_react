Afraid Lyrics
Uh
What they say? What they say? What they say?
What they say? What they say? What they say?

You speak out, all you feel is defiance
All you need is some self-reliance
'Cause this world is gonna always try us
And all you wanted was to run for cover
Well, here's looking to yourself and no other
We're all searching for that special something
And we keep on running

We all have the choice to take the lead or follow
I want to feel the light shine on me

You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay, you'll soon get strong enough
You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
You're so afraid of what people might say
You're going to break, so please, don't do it
You wanna spread your wings but you're not sure
Don't wanna leave your comforts, wanna find a cure
We're afraid of who we see in the mirror
We wanna let go but it feels too pure
Who wants to be alone in this world?
You look around and all you see is hurt
But the light, it always finds us
If we move with a little trust

We all have the choice to take the lead or follow
I want to feel the light shine on me

You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay, you'll soon get strong enough
You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
You're so afraid of what people might say
You're going to break, so please, don't do it

A diamond don't define what shine is
I don't need a Rolex to know what the time is
You got yours, let me find what mines is
I'm a survivor, look how strong my mind is
I stand on my own, it's all me
Regardless of whatever they call me
I'm a leader not a follower
And I'd rather be paid than popular
Grind homie, get your dollars up
We're in the belly of the beast that already swallowed us
It's the end of the world and we know it all
It's the end of the world
And we know it

You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay, you'll soon get strong enough
You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
You're so afraid of what people might say
You're going to break, so please, don't do it

So afraid of what people might say (That's okay)
So afraid of what people might say (That's okay)
So afraid of what people might say (That's okay, that's okay)
So afraid of what people might say (That's okay)
You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay, you'll soon get strong enough
You're so afraid of what people might say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
You're so afraid of what people might say
You're going to break, so please, don't do it1Embed
