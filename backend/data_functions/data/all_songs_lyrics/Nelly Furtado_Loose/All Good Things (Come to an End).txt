All Good Things (Come to an End) Lyrics
Honestly, what will become of me?
Don't like reality, it's way too clear to me
But really, life is dandy
We are what we don't see
We miss everything daydreaming

Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?
Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?
Come to an end, come to an...
Why do all good things come to an end?
Come to an end, come to an...
Why do all good things come to an end?

Traveling, I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay (Stay)
Young and restless
Living this way, I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets in, and I don't cry
I only feel gravity, and I wonder why
Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?
Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?
Come to an end, come to an...
Why do all good things come to an end?
Come to an end, come to an...
Why do all good things come to an end?

Well, the dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon, so that they could—
Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon, so that they could—

Die
Die
Die
Die

Flames to dust, lovers to friends (Dust, friends)
Why do all good things come to an end?
Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end? (An end)
Come to an end, come to an... (End, end)
Why do all good things come to an end? (End, end)
Come to an end, come to an... (End, end)
Why do all good things come to an end? (End)
Well, the dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
And the sun was wondering if it should
Stay away for a day
'Til the feeling went away
And the sky was falling
And the clouds were dropping
And the rain forgot how to bring salvation
The dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon, so that they could die10Embed
