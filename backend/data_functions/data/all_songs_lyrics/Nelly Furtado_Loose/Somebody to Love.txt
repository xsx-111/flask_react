Somebody to Love Lyrics
You got your ways, and I've got mine
It's takin' up all of my time
Waitin' for you to adore me
Come sit and drink from a cup
Don't leave until you're filled up
You're tired of all your travelin'

I don't need nothin' at all
Nothin' but your kiss
And nothin' but your arms
I don't need nothin' at all

But somebody to love
Somebody to hold
Somebody that I can feel in my blood
Somebody to hold
Somebody to own
Somebody to make me feel I'm in love

I know I'm may seem forward
I'm not tryin' to save face
I'm tryna live in this moment
Come closer, sin would say
Tell me how long that it will take
To unravel your body
I don't need nothin' at all
Nothin' but your touch
And nothin' but your hand
I don't need nothin' at all

But somebody to love
Somebody to hold
Somebody that I can feel in my blood
Somebody to hold
Somebody to own
Somebody to make me feel I'm in love

Don't freak, but can you make it through the night for me?
I know you can 'cause you're a man

I need somebody to love
Somebody to hold
Somebody that I can feel in my blood
Somebody to love
Somebody to hold
Somebody to make me feel I'm in love
