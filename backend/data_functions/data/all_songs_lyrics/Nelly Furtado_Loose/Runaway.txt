Runaway Lyrics
There are only two places I could go
One is dark, and it feels so hollow
And it lets me in only to swallow
Too much water 'til I drown, baby
And the other place is calm and sweet
I can almost feel wings beneath my feet
And I don't care if it feels too deep
I like it, I like it

And I know you wanna
Take a chance
And I know you wanna
Understand me
And let me in

But you run away from what you know (What you know)
And you run away from what you don't (What you don't)
I don't wanna wait for you to change your mind
Don't take your time, show me your love tonight

There are only two places that I seek
One is strong, and the other feels so weak
And this plan feels so strange to me
But it's all I see, baby
And I know you wanna
Let it go
And I know you wanna
Flow this love
But you can't

So you run away from what you know (What you know)
And you run away from what you don't (What you don't)
I don't wanna wait for you to change your mind
Don't take your time, show me your love tonight
Oh yeah
Tonight

All the angels know what I know (Know what I know)
You're an angel that sings to me
It's the greatest secret of all (Secret of all)
And I am free from thinkin'

But you run away from what you know (What you know)
And you run away from what you don't (What you don't)
So I don't wanna wait for you to change your mind
Don't take your time, let's make love
Don't run away from what you know (What you know)
Don't run away, just let it go (What you don't)
'Cause I don't wanna wait for you to tell me what's right
Don't fight it, let's make love tonight
Oh yeah
Tonight
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Baby, oh yeah
Let's make love tonightEmbed
