Showtime Lyrics
Our band's in this video too, though
Drums, haha, woo

Put on your best clothes
We've been waiting too long for this moment
I'll put on my best smile
I'm shining inside and I'm proud of our love but
Every time I turn around you say
That you're not checking for love in that way but
Every time I come around you seem
So ready for this

Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights, camera, action
Show what we're about 'cause it's
Showtime, our love's breaking out
Let's show the world
You're my boy, I'm your girl 'cause it's
Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights, camera, action
Let it all hang out 'cause it's
Showtime, yeah, our time is now
Let's show the world
You're my boy, I'm your girl
Let's break a leg out there
This could be the start of the rest of our lives
I've got so much to share (Share)
And I'm ready to put it all out there for you but
Every time I turn around you seem
So afraid of what people might say but
Can't you see it's a game they play?
Tryna cast a shadow on our love

Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights, camera, action
Show what we're about 'cause it's
Showtime, our love's coming out
Let's show the world
You're my boy, I'm your girl 'cause it's
Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights, camera, action
Let it all hang out 'cause it's
Showtime, yeah, our time is now
Let's show the world
You're my boy, I'm your girl 'cause I

Wanna love you when I wanna
Wanna love you where I want to
Wanna touch you when I want to
Wanna kiss you when I wanna
Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights, camera, action
Show what we're about 'cause it's
Showtime, our love's breaking out
Let's show the world
You're my boy, I'm your girl 'cause it's
Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights, camera, action
Let it all hang out 'cause it's
Showtime, yeah, our time is now
Let's show the world
You're my boy, I'm your girl 'cause it's

Not fair to love you in chains
It's not fair to love you in chainsEmbed
