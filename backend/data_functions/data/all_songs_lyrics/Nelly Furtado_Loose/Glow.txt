Glow Lyrics
Alright, I'm ready
(Hit it)

Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
Only you know how to make me
Glow, glow, glow, glow
I wanna go and go and go and go

People say I've gone crazy ('Cause I'm around you)
That I'm not the same lady ('Cause I'm around you)
People say my eyes are hazy ('Cause I'm around you)
People say I'm acting shady (When I am around you)
But I'd rather be your baby (Haha)
Than sit around and do the same things (Same things)
I am getting something out of it
I'm indebted to your good shit
And I could never get enough

Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
Only you know how to make me
Glow, glow, glow, glow
I wanna go and go and go and go
I don't know where I am and I don't know what you did, did
But I think that I may float away
I don't know what happened, I don't know where we went
But I think that I may die today
There's everybody else (Else), and then there's you (You)
Baby, why you gotta be so good? (And I can never get enough, oh)
And tonight, you're on fire (So come around me)
I'm gonna never get tired

Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
Only you know how to make me
Glow, glow, glow, glow
I wanna go and go and go and go

Don't gotta tell you what to do 'cause you're on it
I don't gotta let you in my world 'cause you rock it
I don't gotta tell you what to do 'cause you're on it
I don't gotta let you in my world 'cause you rock it
You rock it, you rock it, you rock it
Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow, glow, glow, glow
Only you know how to make me
Glow, glow, glow, glow
I wanna go and go and go and go

(Go and go and go and go)Embed
