Wait for You Lyrics
I know you're trying to get around me baby
I know you've got me in your heart baby
I know that you could love me
If you only had a guarantee
When I look at your face it's so empty
I know I could fill you with love baby
Your soul is crying for me
Can't deny our energy

And you're far I'm near
You're there I'm here
You're hurting for me I can see it in your eyes
Some of the hardest things are easy to achieve with patience

I'll wait for you until the heavens fall
I'll wait for you until the end of the world
I'll wait for you until I no longer breathe
I know that it's not impossible
I'll wait for you until you finish your fight
I'll wait for you until the timing is right
I'll wait for you until you knock on my door
'Cause right now it's feeling just like a movie
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), just like a movie
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
I know that this is hard for you
Want you to know that I'm feeling it too
It's taken some time but now I see everything
It's so clear to me (To me)
I can't give up your love without dying, baby
I'll wait until the sea is dry, baby
How do we know what love is (Love is)
Until it is free?

And you're far, I'm near
You're there, I'm here
You're hurting for me, I can see it in your eyes
Some of the hardest things are easy to achieve with patience

I'll wait for you until the heavens fall
I'll wait for you until the end of the world
I'll wait for you until I no longer breathe
I know that it's not impossible
I'll wait for you until you finish your fight
I'll wait for you until the timing is right
I'll wait for you until you knock on my door
'Cause right now, it's feeling just like a movie
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), just like a movie
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
You don't gotta do anything that you can't do
You don't gotta do anything in a hurry
You don't gotta do anything in a hurry
I know you're there, you got me
You don't gotta do anything that you can't do
You don't gotta do anything in a hurry
You don't gotta do anything, so don't worry
I trust you, and I know you're there
I know you're there
Ahh... just like a movie
Ahh... just like a movie
Ahh... just like a movie
Ahh... just like a movie (Just like a movie)

I'll wait for you until the heavens fall
I'll wait for you until the end of the world
I'll wait for you until I no longer breathe
I know that it's not impossible
I'll wait for you until you finish your fight
I'll wait for you until the timing is right
I'll wait for you until you knock on my door
'Cause right now, it's feeling just like a movie
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), just like a movie
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)Embed
