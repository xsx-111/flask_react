Undercover Lyrics
Yeah, I like your style
Come on at me, come on at me, comin' all the while, and
And I like to stare
When you walk by, when you walk by
There's somethin' in the air, yeah
And I like to wave (Wave)
Oh, I never seen myself in such a craze, yeah
I'm not insane
But I already have your number and I know your name, and

I think I'd like to know you (Who's that?)
But then maybe I'd see right through you (Who's that?)
I'd kinda like to get to know you (Who's that?)
But then maybe, baby, I'd see right through you (Who's that?)

Why you got your head down?
Why you looking at the ground?
Shiftin' your eyes away
I wanna talk straight
Are you on the getaway?
I'm onto your games
Everything you say is old and late
I can't get in if you keep on runnin'
I can't get in if your heart keeps jumpin'
You've got another lover
You're still undercover
And you look so good
I like you so bad, I gotta knock on wood, yeah
You know I want you
So you keep me hangin' in the ring, you know you do
That's how you play (Play)
I don't care 'cause I'll be here anyway, and
I'll play your game
As long as I can win it at the end of the day, and

I think I'd like to know you (Who's that?)
But then maybe I'd see right through you (Who's that?)
I'd kinda like to get to know you (Who's that?)
But then maybe, baby, I'd see right through you (Who's that?)

Why you got your head down?
Why you looking at the ground?
Shiftin' your eyes away
I wanna talk straight
Are you on the getaway?
I'm onto your games
Everything you say is old and late
I can't get in if you keep on runnin'
I can't get in if your heart keeps jumpin'
You've got another lover
You're still undercover
Watch, watch you now
Watch you come around the corner
Watch, watch you now
Watch you come around the corner
Watch, watch you now
Watch you come around the corner
You turn your head around like you was a transformer
Watch, watch you now
Watch you come around the corner
Watch, watch you now
Watch you come around the corner
Watch, watch you now
Watch you come around the corner
Turn my head around like I was a transformer

Why you got your head down?
Why you looking at the ground?
Shiftin' your eyes away
I wanna talk straight
Are you on the getaway?
I'm onto your games
Everything you say is old and late
I can't get in if you keep on runnin'
I can't get in if your heart keeps jumpin'
Why you got your head down?
Why you looking at the ground?
Shiftin' your eyes away
I wanna talk straight
Are you on the getaway?
I'm onto your games
Everything you say is old and late
I can't get in if you keep on runnin'
I can't get in if your heart keeps jumpin'
You've got another lover
You're still undercover
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I'm not the only one
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I'm not the only one
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Oh, oh, I)
I'm not the only one (Oh, I, oh, I)
The only oneEmbed
