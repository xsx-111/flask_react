Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) Lyrics
This town don't feel mine
I'm fast to get away, far

I dressed you in her clothes
So drive me, far

Away
Away
Away

It feels good
To know you're mine
Now drive me, far

Away
Away
Away

Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
Away
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
Away
So far (Away)
I don't care where, far
(Away)
I don't care just where, far
(Away)
I don't care so where far27Embed
