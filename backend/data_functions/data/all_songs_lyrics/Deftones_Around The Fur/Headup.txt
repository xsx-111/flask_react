Headup Lyrics
Got back out, back off the forefront
I never said or got to say bye to my boy
But it's often I try, I think about
How I'd be screaming and the times we'd be bumping
Our minds would be flowin'
Taking care of shit like, "hey homies, what ya' needin'?"
If life's comin' off whack, well, open your eyes

This has begun you seem to have some doubt
I feel you next to fiending, getting spacey
With the common love of music
Think of this as the sun and the mind as a tool
But we could bounce back from this one
With attitude, will and some spirit
With attitude, will and your spirit
We'll shove it aside

How can you live with that you fucking parasite?
(Soulfly)
How am I supposed to live with this you fucking parasite?
(Fly high)
How can you live with this you fucking parasite?
(Soulfly)
How can I live with that you fucking parasite?
(Fly free)
Shut your shit, please say what you will
I can't think sidestep around
I'm bound to the freestyle
Push it all down to the ground
With a nova dash but they watch you
Now climb up, super slide
The spirit's so low, it's coming over you

How can you live with that you fucking parasite?
(Soulfly)
How am I supposed to live with this you fucking parasite?
(Fly high)
How can you live with this you fucking parasite?
(Soulfly)
How can I live with that you fucking parasite?
(Fly free)
Walk into this world
With your head up high
Walk into this world
With your head up high
Walk into this world
With your head up high
Walk into this world
With your head up high
Walk into this world
With your head up high
Head up, head up, head up, head up, high
Head up, head up, head up, head up, high
Head up, head up, head up, head up, high
Head up, head up, head up, head up, high
Head up, head up, head up, head up, high
Head up, head up, head up, head up, high
Head up, head up, head up, head up, high
Head up, head up, head up, head up, high
Head up, head up, head up, head up, high3Embed
