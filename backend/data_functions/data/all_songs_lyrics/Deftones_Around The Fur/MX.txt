MX Lyrics
You're so sweet
Your smile, your pussy and your bones
You're on fire
You move me like music with your style

Let me think, Let you think about what?
About girls, And what else?
And money and new clothes, And what do I get?
Thirty nights, Uh huh
Of violence, Yeah?
And sugar to love

(Ha ha, ha ha, come here)
Closer to the lung
(Ha ha, ha ha, so I can, so I can)
Shove her over railing

You're sweet
But I'm tired of proving this love
See you're a bore
But you move me, like a movie that you love
Let me think, Let you think about what?
About girls, And what else?
And money, and new clothes, And what do I get?
Thirty nights, Uh huh
Of violence, Yeah?
And sugar to love

(Ha ha, ha ha, come here)
Closer to the lung
(Ha ha, ha ha, so I can, so I can)
Shove her over railing

You make it so easy
Let me think, Let you think about what?
About girls, And what else?
And money, and new clothes, And what do I get?
Thirty nights, Uh huh
Of violence, Yeah?
And sugar to love, Fucking rockstar

(Ha ha, ha ha, come here)
Closer to the lung
(Ha ha, ha ha, come here)
Closer to the lung
(Ha ha, ha ha, so I can, so I can)
Shove her over railing5Embed
