Damone (Hidden Track) Lyrics
Sleep in this hole
Stinging in your eyes
Ashamed
For you 'cause

So far, I've been down, that's true

Shake in lie
About to fall
Ashamed
For you 'cause

So far, I've been down, that's true
Except for your arms
You start, stand still and shove regret back at me

Why (what's up)
I just ask you why (what's up)
One, two
Why (why)
Why (why)
Why (why)
If I ask you why (what's up)
If I ask you why (what's up)
One, two
Why (why)
Why (why)
Why (why)
So I've been you, laughter sigh
I'm so ashamed for you 'cause

So far, I've been down, that's true
Except for your arms
You start, stand still and shove regret back at me

Why (what's up)
I just ask you why (what's up)
One, two
Why (why)
Why (why)
Why (why)
If I ask you why (what's up)
If I ask you why (what's up)
One, two
Why (why)
Why (why)
Why (why)

This feeling gets old, and so do your eyes
This is why, I hate you 'cause
So far, I've been down, that's true
Except for your arms
You start, stand still and shove regret back at me

Why (what's up)
I just ask you why (what's up)
One, two
Why (why)
Why (why)
Why (why)
If I ask you why (what's up)
If I ask you why (what's up)
One, two
Why (why)
Why (why)
Why (why)
Why (what's up)
I just ask you why (what's up)
One, two
Why (why)
Why (why)
Why (why)
If I ask you why (what's up)
If I ask you why (what's up)
One, two
Why (why)
Why (why)
Why (why)2Embed
