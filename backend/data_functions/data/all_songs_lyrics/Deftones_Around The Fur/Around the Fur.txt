Around the Fur Lyrics
Hey vanity, this vial's empty and so are you
Hey glamorous, this vial's not God anymore
Yeah

Speak, I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashion or go by the book?
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back
Coming back around the fur

Prostitute, climb back down from the floor
Please don't fuck around and die like this
'Cause I love her

Speak, I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashion or go by the book?
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back
Coming back around the fur
Speak, speak, you're so bad to me
I don't want to get dressed up anyway
Come on, have some fun
I'm innocent, drop your weapons and come on
Speak, you're a liar
You're a liar and I don't care about her, her, her9Embed
