Dai the Flu Lyrics
I always wondered what it takes
Fifteen stitches and a soft parody
To make my eyes be like deceit
Believe the sting proves heart to me

Now I know that you love me
Thank god that you love at all

Dislocated at the joint
Timing is everything in the bed
'Cause you'll sleep for hours to keep away
Then sink the teeth and bat your eyes

Now I know that you love me
Thank god that you love at all

What surprise right here
Going on and going off
What's the surprise right here
Going on and going off
What's the surprise right here
Going on and going off
What's the surprise right here
Going on
At least now I know
At least now I know
At least
Now I know that you love me
Thank god that you love at all

What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The)
Going on and going off (Flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The)
Going on and going off (Flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The)
Going on and going off (Flu)
What's the surprise (Dai)
Right here (The)
Going on (Flu)

What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai the flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai the flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai the flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai)
Right here (The flu)
What surprise (Dai the flu)3Embed
