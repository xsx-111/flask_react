Rickets Lyrics
It's so simple to look at
Every little thing I do wrong
It's so simple to overlook
Every little thing I do right
Right?

I think too much
I feed too much
I'm gone too much
I stay too much
I snore too much
I'm bored too much
I ate too much
I'm way too much too stuck up

You're probably right
This time but I don't want to listen
You're probably right
This time but I don't even care

I drink too much
I think too much
I stop too much
Lose things too much
I am too much
I'm pissed too much
I need too much
I'm not one to trust
You're probably right
This time but I don't want to listen
You're probably right
This time but I don't even care
And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't say it
And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't speak

I'm bored too much
I think too much
I eat too much
I fix too much
I feed too much
I piss too much
I sleep too much
I snap too often

You're probably right
This time but I don't want to listen
You're probably right
This time but I don't even care
And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't say it
And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't speak2Embed
