Somewhere in the Night LyricsHave you lost your faith
Have you lost your way
Have you lost everything
You thought you held
Yesterday
You should leave me behind
And devote all your time
To kissing the spoon
That you once fed him from
Do you lose your mind
Somewhere in the night
While searching the asides
And the b-sides
You should leave me behind
And devote all your time
To licking the spoon
You once fed him from
Have you lost your faith
Have you lost your way
Have you lost everything
You thought you held
YesterdayEmbed
