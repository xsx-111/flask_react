Whistling Teapot (Rag) LyricsAw who needs you
Lying in your crummy bed
While I'm out here in the cold
With a hope that is so thin
Aw who needs you
Lying in your crummy bed
While I'm out here in the cold cold cold
With a coat that is so thin
You're lying in your crummy bed
You're smoking your drugs
And between the two of you
Could not come up with
Enough compassion not to screw
And between the three of us
Could not come up with
A single reason
And did you have to take
My only friend?Embed
