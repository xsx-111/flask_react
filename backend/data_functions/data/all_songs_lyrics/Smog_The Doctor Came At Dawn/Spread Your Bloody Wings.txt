Spread Your Bloody Wings LyricsAnd though you've known a thousand men
But still
A ship never sailed on your sea
And though you've known a thousand men
But still
Briney waters singe their skins
Icy waves drive them back again
Helmets oars and swords
Are washed upon the shore
And you gave them all a thousand chances
And you'll give them a thousand more
In your eyes a thousand challenges
The water demon's eyes
Are pink and green
Scales of silver mirror mesmerize
The most beautiful thing you've ever seen
Spits bile into your eyeEmbed
