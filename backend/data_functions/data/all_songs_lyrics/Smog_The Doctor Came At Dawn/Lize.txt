Lize LyricsThey don't make lies
Like they used to
They don't make lies
Like they used to
You don't make lies
Like you used to
You don't make lies
Like you used to
In the old days
You took pride in your lies
You used to pay more attention
To details
Not theses flimsy things
You hand me
Nowadays
They don't make lies
Like they used to
They don't make lies
Like they used to
You don't make lies
Like you used to
You don't make lies
Like you used to
They used to be stronger
They used to last longer
You used to pay more attention
To detail
Nowadays the lies that get made
Just fall apart
They don't make lies
Like they used to
They don't make lies
Like they used to
No you don't make lies
Like you used to
You don't make lies
Like you used to
I used to be able
To live off your lies1Embed
