Hangman Blues LyricsHa ha ha
Ha ha ha
Life's a joke
A waiting game now
A juggling of vices
Tiny tiny vices
And they don't anchor me
To the ground
I know who the hangman is
So life's a joke
Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
The clocks on the wall
Creeps higher
Save save
Restraint restraint
It's a joke
And I know who the hangman is
A ship in a vial
A headstone on the wharf
And it will pin me
To the ground
Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
All the lights are green
So unbend
Your toughest smile
I think we've got
I think we've got
I think we've got
One more mileEmbed
