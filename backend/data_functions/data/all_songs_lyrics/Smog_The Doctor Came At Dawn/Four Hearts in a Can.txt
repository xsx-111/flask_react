Four Hearts in a Can LyricsFour hearts in a can
Speeding through the countryside
And they're driving as fast as they can
Four hearts in a can
Speeding through the countryside
And they're driving as fast as they can
Trying to outrun
Four thousand problems
Trying to outrun
Four thousand girls
Four hearts in a can
Speeding through the countryside
And they're driving as fast as they can
Trying to outrun
Four thousand problems
Trying to outrun
Four thousand girls
And they're headed for
Four thousand and one
They're headed for
Four thousand and one
As fast as they canEmbed
