State of Independence LyricsState of life, may I live, may I love
Coming out the sky, I name me a name
Coming out, silver word, for what it is
It is the very nature of the sound the game
Siamese, Indionese
To Tibet treat the life as a game, if you please, he
Coming up, Carabi
This sense of freedom derives from a meditative State
Movin' on, "believe" that's it, call it magic
Third world, it is, I only guessed it
Shablam idi Shublam ida
Shublam idi Shublam ida
Shublam idi Shublam ida
Shot to the soul, the flame of Moroladin
The essence of the word
The "State of Independence"
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sounds like a signal from you
Bring me to meet your sound
And I will bring you to my heart
Love like a signal you call
Touching my body my soul
Bring to me, you to meet me here
Say, yeay yeah yeay oooooooh
Yeay yeah yeay oooooooh oh-oh-ooooh
Be the sound I love today
Hey, hey, time, time again, it is said
We will hear, we will see
See it all, in his wisdom, hear
The truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land
This State of independence shall be
This State of independence shall be
Time, time again, it is said
We will hear, we will see
See it all-in his wisdom-hear
This truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land
This "State of independence" shall be
This "State of independence" shall be
This "State of independence" shall be
This "State of independence" shall be
This "State of independence" shall be
This "State of independence" shall beEmbed
