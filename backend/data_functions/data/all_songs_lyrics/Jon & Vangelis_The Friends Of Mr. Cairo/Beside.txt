Beside LyricsI have seen the compass turning
Round and round my heart
The senses are yearning
For a possible change of heart
That is coming to you
Coming to you
You stand upright
You are different
Why the spinal shock, the fusion, the evil
Spill it out on the floor of belief
Come and mend this design
Come and mend this design
With every right we do
I have seen the sun, this sounds crazy
The story 'bout boy in the rain
He was standing waiting for for the light
As though he did have a reason to know
Did he really know?
His eyes were open, they expected someone
In his heart he felt the compass was turned on
I will echo Ho! for the reasons that change me
Every thought though it takes so long
Is mastered with every plan
It would seem there's no end
To the bad or the goodness in man
So my friend it seems the weariest night
Just leads to a heavenly dawn
Should we see so much in every time we sigh?
Even this we could call music
As that would match my body connection
Let me take your hand
I will be beside you
Beside
He took so much a lot of my mind
I can't help believing what is sublime
Is this fate again and again?
Yes
Am I taught to love above every reason
Everyone, every season?
The compass will turn and turn again
Turn again
And turn againEmbed
