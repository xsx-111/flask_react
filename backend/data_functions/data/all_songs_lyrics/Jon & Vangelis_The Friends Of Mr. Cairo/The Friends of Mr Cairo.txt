The Friends of Mr Cairo Lyrics
Okay, this is the picture
Johnny's been hurt
He's been hurt bad

Look, we can't leave him here, we can't
Look, he's in a pool of blood
He's gonna die, I know it

We've gotta leave him here, honey
We gotta. He won't talk, I promise you that!
Will you Johnny?

Frankie, I don't care whether he talks or not
I just can't leave him like this

Listen. Leave me here
I... I... I can ... I can ... handle it

Oh, no, Johnny, no...
The cops are outside
Luke's in the car
Come on, let's get the hell outta this joint

Frankie, when they get here we're gonna be dead
I know we are!
We don't have a gun!

Listen. We got three million... Listen Spud
We got three million in the car, here
We can't look after him, I'll send the bird to his mother
Come on, let's just get out of this place, we can do it!

Oh no, Johnny, no...

She came, as in the book, Mickey Spillane
That Saturday night dark masquerade
Had filled his friend with lead, the same, sweetheart
But then, as nothing happens quite the same
Investigation is the game
He had to check her story right away
He dead
Sam Space his buddy Archer first to go he got it
(He dead)
She spelt it out, how could they know the "Fatman" got it
(He dead)
Her sister didn't really live at all-confusion
(He dead)
His chase led to the "Fatman", to face the friends of Mr. Cairo

Hey, there's a really terrific dress shop
Can we stop this raid while I buy a new gown?

I'll buy you the whole factory, sweetheart
Don't worry

That night, the double crosser got it right
Pretending he was really dim
He slipped to Sam a double gin "Mickey Finn"
He woke, the boys had gone but not his gun
They'd left a note to lead him on
The chase to find the Maltese Falcon
You bet
Early thirties gangster movies
Set to spellbind population
From Chicago to Hong Kong
Via Istanbul the Talking Tong
Dirty rats thru' prohibition
Money flowed thru gangsterism
Acting out his fantasy
In Hollywoods vicinity
Best part for the best rendition
Al Capone he sent to prison
Citizen Kane came fast and quickly
Conquerin' old New York City
Poking fun at superstition
Media became television
Give me Cagney any day
Or Jimmy Stewart for President
Or Edward G. and all those guys
Who always shoot between the eyes
Between the eyes
Between the eyes

Ha ha ha ha!
Well done Mr. Cairo
And what do you have to say about that my friend?

All right. So you've got me in it
What about her?

Don't worry about me, I'm okay

Very magnanimous Sir
Very magnanimous indeed
Ha ha ha ha ha

You mean...
You won't make us an offer we...
We can't refuse?

Father, love, do you work, do you work for Mother
Chances could call, and accept that, be no other
Science as it might, disappear correspond with color
Chance is the fruit, will outlive, what is now the brother
Call for total wealth to distribute like a picture
In black and white, give it joy, give it, let it hit you
Spoil our existence by extreme gift to population
Father, love, do you work, do you work for Mother
Tell me straight be the Godfather be no other
Media Kings give us now give us total movie
Straight right now, give it clear, give us total movie
Now being here, being now, being here believing

I don't know which words to put in there sweetheart
You know, I can't do it
Pretty kind of useless, though, don't you think so Mary?

Come with me to the far lands of Baghdad

Oh, if only I could
That's what I want more than anything in the world but...
It could never be

Of course it can

But my father would find us wherever we went
Yes, he has forbidden me to... to even speak to you
If he finds me now...
I don't know what he'd do

But he doesn't know that I'm... I'm a prince
Before, I was the thief of Baghdad, now...

It doesn't matter

Then follow me, darling
Follow me now to the ends of the Earth

One on one to talk to you
Like film stars they get close to you
You've mirrored his appeal
He wants you so, he wants to be beside you
Then you pass by
Giving him the other side of you
Like the mystics do
So that every time he moves
He moves for you
Soul and light can always see
The meeting of true love and she
This silent night and I
I guess a lonely mind might see
I've seen love on the screen
I've seen a screen goddess and me
Ooooooooh
How often this, how often this
The power of you
And so, I must confess
Whatever I see
I'm meant to be there with you
With you
Silent golden movies, talkies, technicolor, long ago
My younger ways stand clearer
Clearer than my footprints
Stardom greats I've followed closely
Closer than the nearest heartbeat
Longer that expected, there were great
Oh love oh love, just to see them
Acting on the silver screen, oh my
Clark Gable, Fairbanks, Maureen O'Sullivan
Fantasy would fill my life and I
Love fantasy so much
Did you see in the morning light
I really talked, yes I did, to Gods early dawning light
And I was privileged to be
As I am to this day, to be with you
To be with you, to be with you
To be with you, to be with you

Listen. I have arranged this display for...
For all of you people to...
To come here this evening and I...
I know you have been searched, but, what you...
You don't realize is...
Is that in the back of the Maltese Falcon, I have it...Embed
