Outside of This (Inside of That) LyricsOutside of this inside of that
The memory lingers so right
Completely as that
We've loved a long time
Be my friend, I need you
Inside of this and outside of that
There's so much more to finding out
How we forever simply feel the way the wayward-winds
That hide the storms at night
Like the winter came, it changed our lives
We were very merry to be there
Our love, get used to being this way
Our love, once again a story really true creates a sound
So good, that it's true
So, outside of this, inside of that
There are words that come with time
Like love songs they seem self written
So true, they seem so true
I work a moments time
And feel this is one of life's mysteries
Bringing a smile
'Cause I know what it does to you
So I'm trying to pass it through
Trying for you
Countless variations of the memory
The state the mere emotion of getting 'round
Crazy understandings of the way we tilt the light
But it shines when we make the sound
Don't live by mistakes
We can dance to your tune
But in reaching out and touching your love
Feel those countless understandings
Of the countless many reasons
There are two, offer you my love
Countless understandings
Of a debt to starving nations
Needing love, I tell no lie
Countless staring messages
Has mortal life reflection
Is it spelled out once or twice
But there's this whole understanding
And it's coming I guess, I know
I hope that you can get into this, to this
I was there and then and then
You were there and then and then
We were there, the beginning of time
I was there and then and then
You were there and then and then
We are together in time
I was there and then and then
You were there and then and then
We were there, the beginning of timeEmbed
