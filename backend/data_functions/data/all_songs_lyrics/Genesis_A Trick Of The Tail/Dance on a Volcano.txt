Dance on a Volcano LyricsHoly mother of God
You've got to go faster than that
To get to the top
Dirty old mountain
All covered in smoke
She can turn you to stone
So you better start doing it right
Better start doing it right
You're halfway up
And you're halfway down
And the pack on your back
Is turning you around
Throw it away
You won't need it up there
And remember you don't look back
Whatever you do, better start doing it right
On your left and on your right
Crosses are green and crosses are blue
Your friends didn't make it through
Out of the night and out of the dark
Into the fire and into the fight
Well that's the way the heroes go, ho, ho, ho
Through a crack in mother earth
Blazing hot, the molten rock
Spills out over the land
And the lava's the lover
Who licks your boots away, hey, hey, hey
If you don't want to boil as well
B-b-better start the dance
D-d-do you want to dance with me?
You better start doing it right
The music's playing
The notes are right
Put your left foot first
As you move into the light
The edge of this hill
Is the edge of the world
And if you're going to cross
You better start doing it right
Better start doing it right
You better start doing it right
Let the dance begin2Embed
