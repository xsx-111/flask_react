No Place Like Home LyricsThere's no yellow
Bricks to follow back and run from that disaster
Familiar sins come crashing in
And sever forever and after
My old friend, it's time I leave you here
For once, for all in frozen alabaster
Believe me
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
(Oh oh oh)
A shallow grave where I can keep it safe
Or hide away, for just in case I need it
My old friend, it's time to say goodbye again
No need to tell me where you've been, I feel it
Shallow graves for shallow hearts
For pick-me-ups and fall-aparts
For promises that never started right
Carolina, Carolina, tell me how I'm gonna get down from here?
You only ever just disappear
But I can't let you go
Carolina, Carolina, tell you how am I getting the ending right
I know I started it wrong but I...
I think that it's as easy as 1, 2, 3
Do you see what I do?
Truth or dare, yes, I double dare you
You, you, me, now I think you got it right
(There's no place like home... there's no place like home)
(There's no place like home... there's no place like home)
(There's no place like home)
Oh, another day on the assembly line
Everybody better march in time
Cause the factory don't care why
You've been saying coulda, shoulda, woulda
Oh, another day on the assembly line
Everybody better march in time
Cause the factory don't care why
You've been saying coulda, shoulda, woulda
Oh, another day on the assembly line
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
Everybody better march in time
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
Cause the factory don't care why
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
You've been saying coulda, shoulda, woulda
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
Oh, another day on the assembly line
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
Everybody better march in time
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
Cause the factory don't care why
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
You've been saying coulda, shoulda, woulda
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
I face the music when it's di-ei-ire!
(Aaah, aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aah)
This is true love, ever after (Aaah, aaah aaah aaah)
This is true love, ever after (Aaah, aaah aaah aaah)
True love! ever after!
This is true love! ever after!
This is true love, ever after
Once upon a time
This place was beautiful and mine
But now it's just a bottom line
(There's no)
Yellow bricks and happily. ever after we lived
