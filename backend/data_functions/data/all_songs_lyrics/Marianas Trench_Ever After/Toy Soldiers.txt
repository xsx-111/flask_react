Toy Soldiers Lyrics
Who’ll be my Montague now
To this broken Capulet
How, how, how if not for you
And you’ll be my local hero
Be my role model
And don’t, don’t, don’t fail me now

(My love)
Don’t you wanna love
Don’t you wanna love
I’m your biggest fan
It’s so good to finally meet ya
I deserve a little more
Wouldn’t you say-oh, a-oh, a-oh
(My love)
Don’t you wanna love
Don’t you want to
Don’t you think I deserve better after all that we’ve been through (love)
Don’t you wanna love (love)
Now what you say-oh, a-oh, a-oh

To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I’ll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I’ll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I’ll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I’ll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I’ll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I’ll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I’ll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
Toy soldiers

I will love you like goodbye
I will love you like you died, died
A martyr for me

(My love)
Don’t you want love
Don’t you want this
Don't you look so shocked
This was not the way I planned it
I deserve a little more
Wouldn’t you say-oh, a-oh, a-oh
(My love)
Don’t you want love
Don’t you fight back
Know this will hurt less if you just submit so (love)
How bout a little gratitude
For what I say-oh, a-oh, a-oh

They don’t know you
Not like I do
Only you and I were meant to be
Understand you
Just like I do
Just like you and I were meant to be forever
One day you will
Learn to love me
One day you will
Thank me, you’ll see
If I can’t have you
No one can


I’ll follow
Understand you
Just like I do
Just like you and I were meant to be
Don’t know you
Not like I do
Only you and I were meant to be
Understand you
Just like I do
Just like you and I were meant to be forever2Embed
