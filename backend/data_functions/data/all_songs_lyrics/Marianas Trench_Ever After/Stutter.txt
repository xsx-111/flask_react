Stutter Lyrics
I know I never make this easy
It's easier to disappear
You said give me something that I can go on
Together, yeah, anywhere but here

Sing it back
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Hey, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
And I'm begging you

Bring me back to life
I just can't stand leaving you alone tonight
It's too late to go
Already taken me forever just to try to know
One for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, and four to go
For the life of me
I don't know why it took me so long to see

I just stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Sunshine blinds you if you stare but
Now I see, yeah (crystal), crystal clear
So here I am, you can take or leave me
But I won't ever be anywhere but here

Sing it back
Oh-oh, (yeah) oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Sing it back to me
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
And I'm begging you

Bring me back to life
I just can't stand leaving you alone tonight
It's too late to go
Already taken me forever just to try to know
One for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, and four to go
For the life of me
I don't know why it took me so long to see

I just stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Oh, na na na
Stutter
Oh, na na na
Did I?
Oh, na na na (Yeah)
Oh, na na na
Di-di-di-di-did I?
Oh, na na na
Di-di-di-di-did I?
Oh, na na na
Di-di-di-di
Oh, na na na
Di-di-di-di
Oh, na na na
Di-di-di-di-
Oh, na na na
Di-di-di-di-did I?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Have you been singing
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Hey

Bring me back to life
I just can't stand leaving you alone tonight
It's too late to go
Already taken me forever just to try to know
One for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, and four to go
For the life of me
I don't know why it took me so long to see
I just stutter, Stutter, Stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-did I?
Stutter, stutter, stutter
Di-di-di-di-di-di-did I?6Embed
