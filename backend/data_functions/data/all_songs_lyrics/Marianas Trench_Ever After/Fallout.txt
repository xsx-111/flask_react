Fallout Lyrics
An empty room
I'm empty too
And everything reminds me of you
So many things
I shouldn't have missed
The more that I push
And the more you resist
It's easy to say it's for the best
When you want more
While you leave me with less
I know you're fine but what do I do?
I know you're fine but what do I do?

I'm awake and trying
While you're sleeping like a babe beside him
I'm on the ledge while you're so
Goddamn polite and composed
And I know you see me
And you're making it look so easy
What comes and goes I'd go without

I know you're fine but what if I
(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)
Fallout, through the fallout
(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)
You're the fallout
Well now there's him
And now there's me
The secrets you give
And the secrets you keep
And nevertheless
It's never you let
The more that I give
And the less that I get
Don't tell me to fight
To fight for you
After this long, I shouldn't have to
I know you're fine, but what do I do?
I know you're fine but what do I do?

I'm awake, and trying
While you're sleeping like a babe beside him
I'm on the ledge while you're so
Goddamn polite and composed
And I know you see me
And you're making it look so easy
What comes and goes I'd go without

I know you're fine but what if I
(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)
Fallout, through the fallout
(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)
I know you're fine but what if I
(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)
Fallout, through the fallout
(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)
You're the fallout
(What do I do?
But what do I do?
What do I do?
But what do I do?)
I know you're fine, but what do I do?
I know you're fine, but what do I

I know you're fine but what if I
(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)
Fallout, through the fallout
(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)
I know you're fine but what if I
I'm awake, and trying
While you're sleeping like a babe beside him
I'm on the ledge while you're so
Goddamn polite and composed

(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)
Fallout, through the fallout
(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)
Fallout, through the fallout
(Fallout) fallout (fallout) fallout (fallout)5Embed
