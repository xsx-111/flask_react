So Soon Lyrics
You say, "Sometimes it's like I hardly know you"
And maybe there's some things I never showed you
Sometimes you're certain
But just can't get it working at all

You say to yourself somebody better
Will understand you more than I ever
I'll shake his hand, and smile
And say I understand, well I do
That don't mean I don't think about you

I know we said it's just as well
That I won't keep, keep you for myself
But, I don't want to see you happier
With somebody else, oh

Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
I know you need someone too
This just feels so soon

I know some things should just stay broken
I'm well aware this should remain unspoken
But I've been working on the things
That I was learning all wrong, oh

I know sometimes I only twist ya
And maybe I'm too proud to say I missed ya
But what if here and now
I tell you that I'm all figured out?
Or maybe I just like how that sounds

I know we said it's just as well
That I won't keep, keep you for myself
But I don't want to see you happier
With somebody else

Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
I know you need someone too
This just feels so

And I know it seems beneath me
But sometimes it's not so easy
To wish you well
And let you go
And I say it's just as well
That I just can't keep you for myself
I don't want to see you happier
With somebody else
Oh, lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
This just feels so, this just feels so
Feels so soon
(Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?)
Why can't you be
(Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?)
Why can't you be
(Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?)
This just feels so, this just feels so
This just feels so soon3Embed
