Always Been Your Love Lyrics
I have always been your love
I have always been your love
(You know, I've been thinking)

When I think of all the places we have been
I don't know if I have been another thing
In our heads, there's always been a dream
Of all we've longed to belong to
I don't know if I will be the same again
The same again

I have always been your love
Handed down in open love letters
I have always been your love
Let us write ourselves in right now

I don't know if I can look away again
I don't know which way my gaze will fix to mend
In our heads, there's always been a dream
Of all we've grown to belong to
I don't know why you don't know my name
And I have to remind you
I have to remind you
I have always been your love
Handed down in open love letters
I have always been your love
Let us write ourselves in right now
I have always been your love
I have always been your love

You know what I'm talking about
Well, you wanna know something?
I've always been around
He wonâ€™t do no harm to us
I've always had your back
So I'll slow it down
'Cause I've always been around

I have always been your love
Handed down in broken love letters
I have always been your love
Let us write ourselves in right now
I have always been your love
I have always been your loveEmbed
