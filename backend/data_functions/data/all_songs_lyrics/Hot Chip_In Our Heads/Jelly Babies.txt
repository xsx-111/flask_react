Jelly Babies Lyrics
I'm trying to save my sight
But you're threatening to lead me blind
I used to be like you, I used to be like you
Always had a dream come true
I am the same as you, I am the same is you
Now everybody's dream is filtered through

Where is my head if not with you?
You're drowning into computer blue
I need to be without, I need to be without
I need to send my body out
Where would I take it to?
And when we're there, what will we do?

What do we do when we've turned to
All that we see, what we look into?
Nothing can be but the shattered dream
What do we do when we've turned to
All that we see, what we look into?
Nothing can be but the shattered dream, too

Paint the picture you want to see
Sing the songbird, sing it with me
You're choosing something sweet, you chew on something sweet
A fleshy rubber made of me
A packet does contain a beautiful refrain
Least when the two of you stand free
Where is my head if not with you?
You're drowning into computer blueEmbed
