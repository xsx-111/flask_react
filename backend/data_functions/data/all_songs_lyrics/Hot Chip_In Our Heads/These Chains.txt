These Chains Lyrics
My love is kind to you, my love is blind for you
My love is right for you, I know it is, my boo
I save my eyes for you, I save my sight for you
I save my ears for you, do you hear me, my boo?

These chains you bound around my heart complete me, baby
I would not be free
These chains you bound around my heart complete me, baby
I would not be free

Explain the bond around my heart?
It's not changed since we first made our start
Explain the bond around my heart?
It's not chain since we first made our, we first made our

These chains you bound around my heart complete me, baby
I would not be free
These chains you bound around my heart complete me, baby
I would not be free
These chains you bound around my heart complete me, baby
I would not be free
These chains you bound around my heart complete me, baby
I would not be free1Embed
