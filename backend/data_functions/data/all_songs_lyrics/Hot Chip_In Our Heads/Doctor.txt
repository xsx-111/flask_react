Doctor Lyrics
I don't want to be your doctor
I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your—
Tell me, do you comprehend?

Let's get together
I wanna be your first avenue
And when you call me
You know I'm gonna cry out to you
Let's ride together (Let's ride together)
I'll never take my eyes from the view
And when we're riding
We're on a bike that's built just for two

I don't want to be your doctor
I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your—
Tell me, do you comprehend?

When you call my name
When you call my blood
Does it feel the same?
Is my touch too hard?
Don't lose your patience
I'll always be here waiting for you
And when you hold me
You know I'm holding right onto you
Let's ride together (Let's ride together)
You know I'll be your own point of view
And when we're riding (And when we're riding)
I'll never take my eyes off of you
I don't want to be your doctor
I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your—
Tell me, do you comprehend?
I don't want to be your doctor
I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your—
Tell me, do you comprehend?Embed
