Ends of the Earth Lyrics
You promised me the ends of the Earth but I don't want that
I just want you to feel the belief of a man
They say that love is drunk, but drunk don't let you far
All I want is the you that pulls me back
You promised me the ends of the Earth but I don't want that
I just want you to feel the relief of a man
They say that love is drunk, but drunk don't get you far
All I want is the you that pulls me back

Where I go, you tell me
My voice is within me
Where I go, you spell me
What I start is complete

I try to keep myself topped up with all this good and bad
Don't wanna fall behind the pack and illness send me mad
If you were ever this complete
You've lost yourself, you've lost yourself
You need to reach beyond the star
That falls straight from the shelf
You need to reach beyond the star
That leads straight to your wealth
You promised me the ends of the Earth but I don't want that
I just want you to feel the belief of a man
They say that love is drunk, but drunk don't let you far
All I want is the you that pulls me back
You promised me the ends of the Earth but I don't want that
I just want you to feel the relief of a man
They say that love is drunk, but drunk don't get you far
All I want is the you that pulls me back

Where I go, you tell me
My voice is within me
Where I go, you spell me
What I start is completeEmbed
