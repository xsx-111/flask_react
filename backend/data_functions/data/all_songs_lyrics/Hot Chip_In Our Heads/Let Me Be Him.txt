Let Me Be Him Lyrics
I can see; let me be
I can see; let me be
All this freedom we get, oh, it's not all it's cracked up to be
I can see; let me be
Only falls and rejects, oh, they are all we can see
I can see; let me be
Oh, it's all we need, yeah, we animate reality
I can see; let me be
Only falls and rejects, oh, they are all we can see
I can see

Oh, let me be him, be him, be him
Oh, let me be him
Oh, let me be him
(Oh-oh-oh, hey-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, hey-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Let me be him
(Oh-oh, hey-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
My soul, my love, is running away with me
(Oh-oh, hey-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
And I won't leave it all to you
Let me be him
Work hard, play hard at work
Lend me your ideas
But not too fully formed
So we can't be ignored

Broken into pieces when he sang to me
I can see
Call my name, remember what you mean to me

Let me be him, be him, be him
Oh, let me be him
Oh, let me be him
(Oh-oh-oh, hey-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, hey-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Let me be him
My soul, my love, is running away with me
(Oh-oh, hey-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
And I won't leave it all to you
(Oh-oh, hey-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Let me be him
My soul, my love, is running away with me
(Oh-oh, hey-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
And I won't leave it all to you
(Oh-oh, hey-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Let me be him
My soul, my love, is running away with me
And I won't leave it all to you
All this sinsemilla
Is gonna be the death of me
Dying every evening
Without sleep, how can we be?
With all this sinsemilla
You are really spoiling me
Rotten without reason
Without sense, where would we be?
Started with your treason
Where you forgot to plant a tree
All this sinsemiila
Is gonna be the death of meEmbed
