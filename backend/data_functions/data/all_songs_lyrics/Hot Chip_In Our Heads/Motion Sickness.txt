Motion Sickness Lyrics
Remember when people thought
The world was round? The world was round?
Remember when people thought
The world was round? The world was round?
Everything spins, everything spins on my head
Everything spins, everything spins
Everything spins on my head
Everything spins, everything spins
Everything spins on my head
On my compact disc
Everything spins, everything spins from my head
'Til my motion sickness

Ah oh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah oh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah oh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah oh ooh, ooh, ooh

Remember when we both first felt
The world is sound? The world is sound?
Remember when we both first heard
The wall of sound? The wall of sound?
Everything locks, everything locks to my grid
Everything locks, everything locks
Everything locks to my grid
Everything locks, everything locks
Everything locks to my grid and my broken lid
Everything locks, everything locks to my grid
Under my eyelid
Ah oh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah oh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah oh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah oh ooh, ooh, ooh

I am only turning now to you
I am only felt and seen by you
A world of entertainment in your hands
The world at arm's length, but no contact leftEmbed
