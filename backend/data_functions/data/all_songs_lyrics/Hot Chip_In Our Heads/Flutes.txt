Flutes Lyrics
I know it's nothing more than flutes
But something in my heart is loose
There's never been a better day
And if there is nothing more
Then nothing more will add, I say
There's never been a better day

Work that inside, outside, work that more
Work that right side, left side, work that more
Inside, outside, left side, work the floor
Inside, outside, up top, down with more
Work that inside, outside, work that more
Work that right side, left side, work that more
Inside, outside, left side, work the floor
Inside, outside, up top, down with more

I put up on a string today
Deciding never taught me a thing
A wooden box breathes the way
Never again, never again
Never again, never again

All this talk is getting me down
Nothing's making sense in my brain
I’m moving words across the terrain
Trying hard to fix to the page
I’m wedded to the thought that we came
Only to discover our names
And blow a horn of love in refrain
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
Work that inside, outside, work that more
Work that right side, left side, work that more
Inside, outside, left side, work the floor
Inside, outside, up top, down with more
Work that inside, outside, work that more
Work that right side, left side, work that more
Inside, outside, left side, work the floor
Inside, outside, up top, down with more

All this talk is getting me down
Nothing's making sense in my brain
I’m moving words across the terrain
Trying hard to fix to the page
I’m wedded to the thought that we came
Only to discover our names
And blow a horn of love in refrain
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down

One day you might realise
That you might need to open your eyes
One day you might realise
That you might need to open your eyes
Work that inside, outside, work that more
Work that right side, left side, work that more
Inside, outside, left side, work the floor
Inside, outside, up top, down with more
Work that inside, outside, work that more
Work that right side, left side, work that more
Inside, outside, left side, work the floor
Inside, outside, up top, down with more

One day you might realise
That you might need to open your eyes
One day you might realise
That you might need to open your eyes7Embed
