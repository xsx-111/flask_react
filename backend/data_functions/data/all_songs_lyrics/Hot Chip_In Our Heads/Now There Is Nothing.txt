Now There Is Nothing Lyrics
Now there is nothing that I want
I spend my whole time in my thoughts
Hoping to find my brother's love
Why did it leave us for above?

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do
Hoping to find
What's lost in my mind
Lost in my mind

Dreaming my way through this house of yours
(Now there is nothing)
I picture you standing by the door
Hoping to find your father's smile (Hoping to find)
Gone from the world but not from mine

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do
When you were young
You'd wake before night was done
Not sure where you belong
My name was on your tongue
Oh, oh-oh, my lover
Thinking of all that we used to share
I saw herself just standing there
A memory refracting inside a glow

When you were young
You'd wake before night was done
Not sure where you belong
My name was on your tongue

Now there is nothing that I want (Now there is nothing)
I spend my whole time in my thoughts

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do
Hoping to findEmbed
