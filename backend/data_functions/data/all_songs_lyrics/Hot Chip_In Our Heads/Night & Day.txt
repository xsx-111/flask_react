Night & Day Lyrics
The way I feel about you, baby, in the middle of the night
There’s just one thing that I can do to make me feel alright
The way I feel about you, darling, in the middle of the day
There’s just one thing that we can do to push the pain away

Let’s sweat, let’s sweat
Let’s sweat, let’s sweat
Let’s sweat, let’s sweat
Let’s sweat, let’s sweat

(You know I’m thinking about you)
Night and day, night and day
Night and day, night and day
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day, night and day
Night and day, night

Let’s work it
You want me
But let’s work it
You want me
Just hold me, come on
If I could be beside you, baby, it would make the world alright
The walls that fall around ourselves would celebrate our night
If I could be inside you, darling, at the centre of your life
I’d write no more upon the page, we’d live with no disguise

Let’s sweat, let’s sweat
Let’s sweat, let’s sweat
Let’s sweat, let’s sweat
Let’s sweat, let’s sweat

(You know I’m thinking about you)
Night and day and night
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day and night
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day and night
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day and night

Let’s work it
You want me
But let’s work it
You want me
Just hold me, come on
I don’t got no Abba, I don’t play no Gabba
I like Zapp, not Zappa, so please quit your jibba jabba
I’ve just lined up Macca when you’re in Aiya Napa
Do I look like a rapper? Do I look like a rapper?

(You know I’m thinking about you
You know I’m thinking about you)
Night and day and night
(You know I’m thinking about you)
Night and day and night
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day and night
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day and night
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day and night
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day and night
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day and night
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day and night
(You got me working night and day)
Night and day and night
You got me working night and day
Night and day and night
You got me working night and day
Night and day and night
You got me working night and day
Night and day and night
You got me working night and dayEmbed
