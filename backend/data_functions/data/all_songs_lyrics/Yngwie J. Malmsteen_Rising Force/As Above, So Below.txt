As Above, So Below LyricsThere's a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why
Cause I don't know
There is a long way to go
Future will show
Where the road is leading me
I will never die
Cause I will fly
To the other side
I will never die
Cause I will fly
To the other side
Trying to fight
For what is right
But evil spirits pass me by
They do what they want
They just don't care
What you feel or what you say
I will never die
Cause I will fly
To the other side
I will never die
Cause I will fly
To the other side
There's a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why
Cause I don't know
There is a long way to go
Future will show
Where the road is leading me
I will never die
Cause I will fly
To the other side
I will never die
Cause I will fly
To the other side
I will never die
Cause we will fly
To the other side
I will never die
Cause I will fly
To the other sideEmbed
