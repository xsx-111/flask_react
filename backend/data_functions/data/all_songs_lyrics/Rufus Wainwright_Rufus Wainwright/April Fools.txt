April Fools Lyrics
Oh, what a shame
That your pockets did bleed on St. Valentine's
And you sat
In a chair thinking "Boy, I'm such a prince!"
Well, life's a train that goes from February on
Day by day
But it's making a stop on April first

And you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
But just until the fish start to smell
And you're struck down by a hammer

Sure, you were swift
When the handsome Greek boys dropped by with gifts
You are suave
Thanks to ribbons that open sesame
But in the stars and closer to home, in every planet
It ain't hard for me and dear Jojo to see

That you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
But just until the fish start to smell
And you're struck down by a hammer
So let it all go by
(Let it all go by)
Looking at the sky
(Looking at the sky)
Wondering if there's clouds and stuff
(Wondering if there's clouds and stuff)
In hell
(Let it all go by)
Let it all go by
(Looking at the sky)
Looking at the sky
(Wondering...if clouds)
Wondering if there's clouds in hell

And you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes, you will believe in love
'Cause you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
(Yes, you will believe in love)
'Cause you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes, you will believe in love
And you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes, you will believe in love1Embed
