Sally Ann Lyrics
My true love did breathe
By the Sally Ann so softly
That while walkin' through town
Only my heart did hear him
In views of the city

There ain't many folks
By the Sally Ann so pretty
That while walkin' through town
Many a twisted feature
Made a terrible beauty
Beauty

And then I knew
And then I knew
I'd been there before

One thing you must know
By the Sally Ann directly
Is that the pockets don't hold
Any more sunken treasures
After baptism by whiskey
But when leavin' the bar
By the Sally Ann just barely
That old angel may allow
Light from above the mountain
And red brick walls blooming
You may see

And then you'll know
And then you'll know
You've been there before
And then you'll know
And then you'll know
You've been there beforeEmbed
