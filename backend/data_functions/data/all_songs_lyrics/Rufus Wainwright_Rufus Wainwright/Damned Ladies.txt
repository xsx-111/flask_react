Damned Ladies Lyrics
Desdemona do not go to sleep
Brown-eyed Tosca don't believe the creep
I see it in his eyes
And why don't you ladies
Believe me when I'm screaming
I always believe you

Violetta keep your man locked up
Or like Cio-Cio you will end up
Burned by love or sickness
And why don't you ladies
Believe me when I'm screaming
I always believe you

There is a knock at the door
Tell me it's not Mimi again
Or is it Gilda's waiting passion
To be stabbed and killed again
Katya Kabanova why did you marry him?
You knew his mother was a bitch
And would keep hold of him
Oh Pamina got away from mama
Before the age of Rambo Opera
Damned ladies of Orpheus
Your arias cause a stir
In my sad
Sad and lonely heartEmbed
