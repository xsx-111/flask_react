Imaginary Love Lyrics
Every kind of love
Or at least my kind of love
Must be an imaginary love to start with
Guess that can explain the rain waiting walking game
Schubert bust my brain to start with

'Cause every kind of love
Or at least my kind of love
Must be an imaginary love to start with, baby
Guess that can explain the rain waiting walking game
Schubert bust my brain to start with

Hoped to look at you in a cab
Back of your head across my lap
Oh what grace
Green back seat against the red of your face

Hoped to look at you in any old grand hotel
Drunken demands gave way to reservations
Oh what a room
Champagne brings such happy faces
Happy faces
'Cause every kind of love
Or at least my kind of love
Must be an imaginary love to start with
Guess that can explain the rain waiting walking game
Schubert bust my brain to start with

'Cause every kind of love
Or at least my kind of love
Must be an imaginary love to start with, baby
Guess that can explain the rain waiting walking game
Schubert bust my brain to start with

Oh, oh, oh oh oh ohEmbed
