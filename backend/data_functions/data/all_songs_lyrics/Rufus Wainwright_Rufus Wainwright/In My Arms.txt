In My Arms Lyrics
You gave me all your love in one day
You gave it all and almost faded away
Well I'm gonna take this sad unread issue
In my arms tonight
Looking at hospitals Victorian
Feeling as helpless as the Elephant Man
Wish you were here to chain you up without shame
In my arms tonight

So if you should feel
A bit out of place
This vision not unlike a shooting star
I have embraced

'Cause you gave me all your love in one day
You gave it all and almost faded away
Well I'm gonna take this sad unread issue
In my arms tonight
Looking at hospitals Victorian
Feeling as helpless as the Elephant Man
Wish you were here to chain you up without shame
In my arms tonight
I ain't a soft and saccharine wannabe
Still I pray to God this song will end happily
So I offer you a place to rest
And forget yourself
In my arms

'Cause I ain't a soft and saccharine wannabe
Still I pray to God this song will end happily
So I offer you a place to rest and forget yourself
In my arms
Yourself in my arms
Yourself in my arms
Yourself in my arms

A place to rest
And forget yourself
In my arms tonightEmbed
