Foolish Love Lyrics
I don't want to hold you and feel so helpless
I don't want to smell you and lose my senses
And smile in slow motion
With eyes in love
I twist like a corkscrew
The sweetness rising
I drink from the bottle, weeping
Why won't you last?
Why can't you last?

So I will walk without care
Beat my snare
Look like a man who means business
Go to all the poshest places
With their familiar faces
Terminate all signs of weakness

Oh, all for the sake
All for the sake
Of a foolish love

I will take my coffee black
Never snack
Hang with the wolves who are sheepish
Flow through the veins of town
Always frown
Me and my mistress, the princess
Oh, all for the sake
All for the sake
Of a foolish love
Yeah, yeah

So the day Noah's ark floats down park
My eyes will be simply glazed over
Or better yet I'll wear shades on sunless days
And when the sun's out, I'll stay in and slumber

Oh, all for the sake
All for the sake
Of a foolish love
For the sake
All for the sake
Of a foolish love

'Cause I don't want to hold you and feel so helpless
I don't want to smell you and lose my senses
And smile in slow motion
With eyes in loveEmbed
