Millbrook Lyrics
The boys and girls of Millbrook
Are on the train from New York
Wearing new hats, shooting the shit
Deep in the heart of Dutchess County, bounty

And all the evening breakdowns
Will soon be washed from their hands
The next very day, as they make way
Eating the apple to the chapel, holy

Don't even try
They'll get away with murder
Sure as the rain washes away
And brings thunder

Oh, tell me can you see
The gentle tower rising?
Over the pines, out of a book
Zion mistaken for the state of MillbrookEmbed
