I Feel Mysterious Today LyricsAlways cause for concern
When you're feeling quite bright
And your filament burns
I feel mysterious today
Everything is humming loudly
I feel mysterious today
Everyone is coming this way
Is it ever appealing
To stand on a ceiling?
Observe the tension grow
I feel mysterious today
Everything is humming loudly
I feel mysterious today
Everyone is coming this way
Going walking abroad
Minus hat before dawn
Bats in profusion there
I feel mysterious today
Everything is humming loudly
I feel mysterious today
Everyone is coming my way
Did you ever conceive
That you too can leave
Exactly when you like?Embed
