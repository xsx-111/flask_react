Another the Letter LyricsPassed to hand, behind the curtain
The letter brings change, now things are uncertain
Hand to hand, the letter moves on
Like a series of shocks, like a series of shocks
Like a series of shocks, like a series of shocks
Like a series of shocks, but the contents are known
Oh, faint heart, when the letter arrives
You suddenly find things looking
Life-size, life-size, life-size, life-size
Once the air rang with things unsaid
Now cruel outlines are easily read
Behind the curtain, in the yellow bulb light
In the yellow bulb light, in the yellow bulb light
In the yellow bulb light, in the yellow bulb light
In the yellow bulb light, in the yellow bulb light
The letter reads: I took my own lifeEmbed
