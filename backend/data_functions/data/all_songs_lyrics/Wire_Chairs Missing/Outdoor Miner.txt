Outdoor Miner Lyrics
No blind spots in the leopard's eyes
Can only help to jeopardise
The lives of lambs, the shepherd cries

An outdoor life for a silverfish
Eternal dust less ticklish
Than the clean room, a houseguest's wish

He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth

Face worker, a serpentine miner
A roof falls, an underliner
Of leaf structure, the egg timer

He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
(He lies on his side)
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
(Is he trying to hide?)
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
(He lies on his side)
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
(Is he trying to hide?)4Embed
