Being Sucked in Again LyricsA dorsal fin breaks the water
Salted meat, a sudden relapse
Inference drawn from every word
Being sucked
Being sucked in again
Being sucked
Being sucked in again
Being sucked
Being sucked in again
Being sucked
Feeling numbed from anaesthetised flesh
Avoid disgrace, ideas still fresh
The gaping mouth, a fish-wive's dream
Being sucked (Being sucked)
Being sucked in again
Being sucked (Being sucked)
Being sucked in again
Being sucked (Being sucked)
Being sucked in again
Being sucked (Being sucked)
Bound and gagged your labour's saved
The cost minute, the rules are waived
No hand, no step, your labour's in vain
Being sucked (In again)
Being sucked in again
Being sucked (Being sucked)
Being sucked in again
Being sucked (Being sucked)
Being sucked in again
Being sucked (Being sucked)
Being sucked in again
Being sucked (In again)
Being sucked in again
Being suckedEmbed
