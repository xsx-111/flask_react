Sand in My Joints LyricsI've got sand in my joints
I'm counting the grains
And they're so sharp
I'm feeling the pain
I'm like King Canute's daughter
A lamb to the slaughter
My feet in the water
It's not what they think
It's not what it seems
I've got sand in my joints
Oh, I'm counting the grains
And they're so sharp
I'm feeling the pain
Pain, pain
I'm feeling the pain
I'm feeling the pain
I'm feeling the pain
I'm feeling the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the painEmbed
