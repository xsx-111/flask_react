Too Late LyricsOh, you should miss her, she says she's my sister
She's never hard to find
She's tender-trusting, she's everlasting
Can I change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Mirror, mirror, icy sister
Love is never blind
She's slowly turning, mouth gently burning
Can I change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
She pisses icy water on poetic mornings
Got to be cruel to be kind
Is this real life, is it for life?
Can I change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late?2Embed
