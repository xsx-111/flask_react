Used To LyricsDoes the pain remain when the head is turned
And the body walks away? You used to know
Does nausea ensue when you chance upon a memory
Of someone you used to know?
Does warmth increase when the pulse is strong
But the response is weak? You used to know
I just lay down guidelines in front of me
It's similar to the things you do to me
Does the pain remain when the head is turned
And the body walks away? You used to know
Does nausea ensue when you chance upon a memory
Of someone you used to know?
Does warmth increase when the pulse is strong
But the response is weak? You used to know
I'll give you an example typically
It's less complicated than it simply should be1Embed
