Heartbeat LyricsI feel icy
I feel cold
I feel old
Is there something there behind me?
I'm sublime, I'm sublime
I'm sublime, I'm sublime
I'm sublime, I'm sublime
I'm sublime, I'm sublime
I feel empty
I feel dark
I remark
I am mesmerised by my own beat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
In its own beat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeatEmbed
