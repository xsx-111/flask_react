Men 2nd LyricsSailing under a false flag
We're crossing the IDL
Becalmed where no creature lives
Lost, forsaken, cursed
Holed below the water line
A shift in the plimsoll line
Pumps in the engine room
Women and children first
Hysterical, no humour
Sabotage, a rumour
Captainless and captionless
Injury, hunger, thirst
Reptile, prehensile
Servile, editorial
Gentile, fatal1Embed
