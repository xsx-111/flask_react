Marooned LyricsAn unwilling sailor adrift from Arctic waters, ah
As the water gets warmer, my iceberg gets smaller, ah
As he pours more petrol on, he feels no fear
As the flames get nearer, his thoughts get clearer, ah
A blue-white polar bear arrives at the end, ah
Diverting his attention, his feelings froze over, ah
I'm only a runaway AWOL at the logical start
Not present in the present, overboard with limited future
And I'm standing alone, still getting a thrill
While the ship is afloat, he's losing his boat, ahEmbed
