Practice Makes Perfect LyricsPractice makes perfect, yes, I can prove it
Business or pleasure, the more that you do it
Please dress in your best things, this course was unplanned
Cos you see up in my bedroom, I've got Sarah Bernhardt's hand
Practice makes perfect, I've done this before
Never for money, always for love
Please dress in your best things and don't make a fuss
Cos you see up in my bedroom, Sarah's waiting for us
Waiting for us
Waiting for us, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us!
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us!
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us!2Embed
