French Film Blurred LyricsAnd I didn't understand your plea to live
Or the guy's wish to take or give
However, I was backing away
He fell and lay dead amongst the fireworks display
It's not quite the way to say goodbyes
It's not quite the way to behave
Secured you a concrete grave beneath a motorway
Gold scissors cut the ribbon and set them loose
On the opening day the vibrations will shake your bones
I suppose that's the disadvantage
Of not speaking a second language
A second language
A second language
A second language
A second language
(The problems of bad reception resulting in blurred perception)
A second language
A second language
A second language
A second language
A second language
A second languageEmbed
