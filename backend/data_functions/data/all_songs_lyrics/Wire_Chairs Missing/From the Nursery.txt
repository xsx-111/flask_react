From the Nursery LyricsSo truly jolly, an Xmas dolly
I talk on request, I'm never depressed
I'll wink a good time till someone pokes me
One big blue eye out
So simply heady, a birthday teddy
Punches make me bleat, this bare soul is sweet
Keeping you warm at night till someone rubs me
Hey, a fun-filled toy
A fun-filled toy
Free on a tightrope lives the animal soap
Safe, used, been tested, body molester
Amphibious charm, scum in several baths
Has blurred my features
Oh, Would you like to say what that silence was meant to intend?
Oh, would you like to see what violence these eyes can send
To your heart
From the nursery
To your heart
From the nursery
To your heart
From the nursery
To your heart
From the nursery
To your heart
From the nursery
To your heart
From the nursery
To your heartEmbed
