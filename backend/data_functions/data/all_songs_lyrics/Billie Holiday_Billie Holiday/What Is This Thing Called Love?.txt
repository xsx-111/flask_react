What Is This Thing Called Love? LyricsWhat is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?Embed
