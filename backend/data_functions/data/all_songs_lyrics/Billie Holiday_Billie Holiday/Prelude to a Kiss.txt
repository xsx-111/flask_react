Prelude to a Kiss LyricsIf you hear a song in blue
Like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss
If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss
Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh! How my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kissEmbed
