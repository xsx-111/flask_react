Yesterdays LyricsYesterdays
Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance and love
Then gay youth was mine
Truth was mine
Joyous free in flame and life
Then sooth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreamin' of
Yesterdays

Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance and love
For then gay youth was mine
Truth was mine
Joyous free in flame and life
Then sooth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreamin' of
