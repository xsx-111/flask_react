This Is Heaven to Me LyricsWhen I hear them say
There's better living
Let them go their way
To that new living
I won't ever stray
'Cause this is heaven to me
Long as freedom grows
(Long as freedom grows)
I want to seek it if it's yes or no
(If it's yes or no)
It's me who'll speak it
'Cause the lord, he knows
That this is heaven to me
If you've got your hands
And got your feet
To plow your land
And cut your wheat
You raise your head
When night is done
Shout your thanks up to the sunEmbed
