Body and Soul LyricsMy days have grown so lonely
For you I cry, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longin'
You know it's you that I am longin'
Oh, I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd throw away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I can have one more chance to prove, dear
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
Oh, I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

My days have grown so lonely
For you I cry, for you dear only
Oh, Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longin'
And it's for you that I am longin'
Oh, I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd throw away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I can have one more chance to prove, dear
My life a hell you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
Oh, I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soulEmbed
