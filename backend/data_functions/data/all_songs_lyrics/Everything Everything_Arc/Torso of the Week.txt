Torso of the Week Lyrics
Girl, you've been hitting that treadmill like a freak
Maybe you're not quite the torso of the week
The hollowest cheeks in the county, Tyne to Tweed
Jogging all over my grave, baby, with your weeping feet

Coiled heart, eye-tooth, feral child
Take me dancing in the wild
You're looking like you're bored with your husband
You're looking like you might have a question
So why you staring out of the window?
I can't stop that pain unless you tell me

What you're wrestling with, what you're wrestling, wrestling
What you're wrestling with, what you're wrestling, wrestling with
Girl, you've been hitting that treadmill like a freak
What you're wrestling with, what you're wrestling, wrestling
What you're wrestling with, what you're wrestling, wrestling with
Maybe you're not quite the torso of the week

Girl, you've been offered the big deal, don't look back
Impossible perks of the lifestyle, gold and black
The minerals all through your system, that's my girl
Juggling all of your babies with your backbone curled
Coiled heart, eye-tooth, feral child
Take me dancing in the wild
You're looking like you're bored with your husband
You're looking like you might have a question
So why you staring out of the window?
I can't stop your pain unless you tell me

What you're wrestling with, what you're wrestling, wrestling
What you're wrestling with, what you're wrestling, wrestling with
Girl, you've been hitting that treadmill like a freak
What you're wrestling with, what you're wrestling, wrestling
What you're wrestling with, what you're wrestling, wrestling with
Maybe you're not quite the torso of the week

Coiled heart, eye-tooth, feral child
You're looking like you might have a question
You're looking like you're lost on your thinking
You're screaming like you saw all your futures
Your wrist is on my knife next to the trampoline

What you're wrestling with, what you're wrestling, wrestling
What you're wrestling with, what you're wrestling, wrestling with
Girl, you've been hitting the treadmill like a freak
What you're wrestling, wrestling, what you're, what you're
What you're wrestling, wrestling with
Maybe you're not quite the torso of the week
Take my life
Dredge her up
What you're wrestling, wrestling, what you're wrestling with
What you're wrestling, wrestling with
Maybe you're not quite the torso of the week
