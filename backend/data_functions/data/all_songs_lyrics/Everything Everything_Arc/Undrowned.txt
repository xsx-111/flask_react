Undrowned Lyrics
First, boy, I think you should know
If you try hard then you might get a part as a
Doe-eyed impressionist mime
Bare as the lives of the footballers' wives
That surround you, their diamonds aloft
A system of pistons, arachnid and blistered
A billboard, a murder of crows
While princes fly drones that can see through your bones
And the wind stops, the temperature drops
And harpies melt through you like horses to glue
I believe you, but not what you say
To close it around 'til you're scorched and undrowned
They devour you and totter in heels
And who wants the Falklands, and who wants the Balkans?
I love you, just like a bank
There's so much to talk about that we don't talk about, boy

Trust in me
I fell

She said, "It fills me with dread
The people in Parliament don't know the half of it
Please, son, it's only a sport
The fate of a ball don't enthrall me at all"
So relax here, go through it again
Who have you seen knows what all of it means?
I fell down, down
And I saw a billionaire
With all his innards nailed
To the walls, to the walls, to the West
Don't fear it now
But don't stop asking

Hey, man, you're probably right
It's not a galaxy made for a guy like me
Birdless, the edge of the world
The edge of my memory, some kind of energy
Burned up and frittered away
Bile in the gutters and gout for a god
But I'm lawful, I kept my head down
I turned a blind eye and I played my cards right
I'm in debt, man, I've waited too long
I bought all the right things, I thought all the right things
I'm lonely, I don't know myself
I thought there was something, I waited for something

Oh, down, down
Don't leave
Don't leave
Don't leave
Don't leave me (To the walls, to the walls, to the West)
Don't leave
Don't let me down6Embed
