Duet Lyrics
Do you feel left behind
Like there's something not right?
I don't think I've been connected
But of all the dead volcanoes on Earth
You just happened to retch and roll through mine
There were fistfuls of hair
'Round the foot of my chair
And acres of screens before me
But breathing out, I swear you were real

You were there
You were there
You were there
For a while

But I don't know what's real and what's going on
And I don't wanna be here when the sky is gone
(I just can't keep up with it and)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired
(Heavens give me something more)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired
It was said with a wink
It was slipped in my drink
A Necropolis for the taking
Where all the cities flow into one
And there's nothing but knives and fears and forks
Seems the more I find out
The more unsure I become
And baby, I get the feeling
There's some new dark, unknowable yet
And it's here (I feel it coming, one, one step from nothing, I)
And it's here (I feel it coming, one, one step from nothing, I)
And it's here (I feel it coming, one, one step from nothing, I)
For a while (I-I, I-I)

But I don't know what's real and what's going on
And I don't wanna be here when the sky is gone
(I just can't keep up with it and)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired
(Heavens give me something more)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired

But I can hear them plunder in the streets at night
You never should have told them what you have inside
And I don't want my children in an endless race
And I don't wanna wait to see what else they take
(Sulphur howling over you and)
And all that matters now is that we don't let go
(Black caldera ash and falling)
And you can be my wonder in my time of woe
(Tarred and feathered genii)
If it's gonna happen, let it happen now
(Acid in the tears alone)
If it's gonna happen, let it happen now
