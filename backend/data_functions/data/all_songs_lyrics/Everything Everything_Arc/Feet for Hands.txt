Feet for Hands Lyrics
There were reasons to get out of my bed, eh
Slipping in and out of what you call life
And it plays again and I can see him ending
On a pale road and I died that day
Makes no difference if they're open or closed
When you shake my hand, I'm a hero, I'm a hero
And I'm dealing, yeah, I'm dealing fine

I think I've had enough of all the lights on Earth
I think I'm done with answering the phone, eh
I pour myself a bridge and now I can't go back
I think it's gonna happen pretty soon

Dealing for the longest time
And I'm sorry that I've made it this far
When you think of me, don't remember this
Not a slow wane of a blinded man
And the faces of my family fade
Now as featureless as an orange, as an orange to me
So tired, don't you let me go

I think I've had enough of all the lights on Earth
I think I'm done with answering the phone, eh
I pour myself a bridge and now I can't go back
I think it's gonna happen pretty soon
You ask, "How many fingers am I holding up?"
I don't know what is taking me so long
Let's get up off the floor and use our feet for hands
I see double, I see double yellow lines

And I can see us laid out by a waterfall
Don't remember, don't remember me this way, eh-eh-eh, eh
But what makes her so sure that there's a world outside?
Yeah, she really had me going for a while, eh-eh-eh, eh

I won't forget you
I won't forget you
I won't forget you3Embed
