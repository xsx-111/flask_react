Cough Cough Lyrics
(Cough cough) yeah, (cough cough) so, (cough cough) um, (cough cough), wait a second
(Cough cough) yeah, (cough cough) so, (cough cough) um, (cough cough), wait a second
(Cough cough) yeah, (cough cough) so, (cough cough) um, (cough cough), wait a second
(Cough cough) yeah, (cough cough) so, (cough cough) um, (cough cough), wait a second

Sold your liver, but you still feel in the red
Sold my feelings, now I'm hanging by a thread

Bad, and it's creeping its way through my windows
And it's slithering under my door
And it's in my peripheral vision
And it's boring up under my floor
And it's whispering into my eardrums
And it's telling me that I want more (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

But I'm coming alive
I'm happening now (Happening now)
I'm coming alive (Coming alive)
I'm happening now (Happening now)
I'm coming alive (Coming alive)
I'm happening now (Happening now)
I'm coming alive (Coming alive)
I'm happening now (Happening now)
And that eureka moment hits you like a cop car
And you wake up just head and shoulders in a glass jar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You clear your throat, you raise your eyebrow, but you don't say
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
There's something wrong, but it's okay if we're still getting paid

Yeah, you're ravenous, you're champing at the bit
Just a cog next to a cog next to a pit
I would burn to break away and waste my years
No more ladder, no more solace in arrears

Bad, and it's creeping its way through my windows
And it's slithering under my door
And it's in my peripheral vision
And it's boring up under my floor
And it's whispering into my eardrums
And it's telling me that I want more (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

But I'm coming alive (Coming alive)
And I'm happening now (Happening now)
I'm coming alive (Coming alive)
I'm happening now (Happening now)
I'm coming alive (Coming alive)
I'm happening now (Happening now)
I'm coming alive (I'm coming alive)
I'm happening now (Happening now)
And that eureka moment hits you like a cop car
And you wake up just head and shoulders in a glass jar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You clear your throat, you raise your eyebrow, but you don't say
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
There's something wrong, but it's okay if we're still getting paid

But I'm coming alive (Coming alive)
And I'm happening now (Happening now)
I'm coming alive (Coming alive)
I'm happening now (Happening now)
I'm coming alive (Coming alive)
I'm happening now (Happening now)
I'm coming alive (I'm coming alive)
I'm happening now (Happening now)

And that eureka moment hits you like a cop car
And you wake up just head and shoulders in a glass jar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You clear your throat, you raise your eyebrow, but you don't say
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
There's something wrong, but it's okay if we're still getting paid
But I'm coming alive
