Choice Mountain Lyrics
I'm trying to leave my ocean home
I'm trying to leave my ocean
Though I don't know nothing of the swamp
And I could be a limbless star
Pushing at the sac
All ready to delight the lucid shoal

And you don't look impressed
I could be the dolphin of your dreams
Willing wings to my chest
One day I'll grow up and show you

Harpoons and monsoons won't keep me at bay
There's so much yet to happen
My limbs, now my fins, now a film on my lips
And why you never call back?
I'm older, I'm colder, I'm not coming good
A cherub in the ashtray

Wriggling back to the source
And thrashing up the waterfalls for what?
Somewhere there is a place
And I could be the whale that takes it all
But maybe I'm a lioness
And when I reach the shore I'll
Tear apart hyenas with no thought
Now organs in a glassy globe
And cloudy with potential
Muscle mass and vertebrae begin

Trying to figure my place
And feverish with all my dreams away
They don't notice me now
But I could be the whale that takes them all
Them all

Try this and try this and try this again
I'm never gonna make it
Delete me, repeat me, let's try this again
A tiny little fish egg
Is homeless, and boneless, and drifting along
Just jelly in the blackness

And inching up to the pole
Only to be lost among the white
Somewhere there is a place
And I could be a Pterodactyl God
I'm trying to leave my ocean home1Embed
