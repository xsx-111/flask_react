Kemosabe Lyrics
Four walls and a cauldron of Kalashnikoving
And our home is a trigger that I'm always pulling
At the border, at the, at the border
I'm at the border, at the, at the border
The short spears and the weak eternal monologuing
And our war is the crucible of all your longing
At the border, at the, at the border
I'm at the border, at the, at the border, hey

I was there when the clamour got real
And I was there when your brow smashed the wall
It's like a riot with only two perps
The more I'm here, I'm making it worse
But does it feel like you're already dead? (Yes!)
And do you feel like your brain stopped delivering?
Yeah, break my finger, shoot out my black eyes
What does it matter if everyone dies?

(Hey!) Hey, Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
(Hey!) Hey, Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
Hi-yo, Silver, away
So fast hence, take an arrow from your quiver or we're
Past tense, what's a trilobite to anyone?
I'm outta my depth, outta, outta my depth
I'm outta my depth, outta, outta my depth, hey
My head reels and I'm crawling down the corridor
I can't see but I'm heaving like a holocaust
I'm reaching my phone, reaching, reaching my phone
I'm reaching my phone, reaching, reaching my phone

You wasn't there when I orphaned that boy (No!)
Your body was and the white of your rolling eye
I saw some terrible things on that night
I done a lot of bad things with my life
Mmm, I put my fingers in thee
Hey, and I breeze past security
Nobody checking on all of my deeds
I need a checker for all of my deeds

(Hey!) Hey, Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
(Hey!) Hey, Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
And we be trapped in the amber, last joy
And I'm looking at a holy ghost
But there's no silver bullet for a memory
I field dress every moment but you're telling me
That Tonto say, I've lost my way

(Hey!) Hey, Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
(Hey!) Hey, Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
Hi-yo, Silver, away

Mmm, and I'm lost and I'm drained
Enough genuflecting in a penitent way

(Hey!) Hey, Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
(Hey!) Hey, Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
Hi-yo, Silver, away3Embed
