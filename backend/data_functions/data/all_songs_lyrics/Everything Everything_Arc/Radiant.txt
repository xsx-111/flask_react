Radiant Lyrics
I'm staring through the telescope hungry
I'm staring through the telescope at all, at all, I know
When every inch of matter is measured
And every force and element is known, is known, it's on
You're looking for whatever comes after
You're looking for a way to escape, escape it all
You're looking for a map with no markings
You're having second thoughts about it all, it all

But I see a Geiger counter
And I see a Richter scale

Go, leave your homes
Take whatever you can
It's no joke
It's coming towards you, yeah

And you can make a difference so easy
You could make a difference, but you don't, you don't, I know
You'd never tell me anything real now
You never have the time to watch it all, it all, I know
And everybody thinking of the same thing
And nobody is saying it you know, you know it all
You skip a generation and find it
You skip a generation and oh, and oh
And I see a Geiger counter
And I see a Richter scale
And the truth is the birth of a child
The sunlight, it's all I ever had

Go, leave your homes
Take whatever you can
It's no joke
It's coming towards you
Go, leave your homes
Take whatever you can
It's no joke
It's coming towards you, yeah

And I could make a difference so easy
I could make a difference but I don't
Darling, I'm closing1Embed
