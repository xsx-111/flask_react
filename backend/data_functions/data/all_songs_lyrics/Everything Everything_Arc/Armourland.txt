Armourland Lyrics
The street is a boneyard, she glances
Numb as a drain at the end, end
Cradling heat waves and armour
'Round her body slowly
And how ready are you to know this?
How do we live in the end, end?
I bet you the price of the landmine
You won’t be here at the end, end
You won’t be slumped in a doorway
You’ll be standing above you
And how can you call this a free world?
Who wouldn't call out at the end, end?

No more doubt about it, oh

I wanna take you home
Take off your blindfold and show you what I am
I wanna take you home
And find some new joy in this autopilot life
I wanna take you home
Slow down your heartbeat and dry those glazing eyes
I wanna take you home
Blackout our windows and hold you 'til we die
What if the first step was leaving?
And stepping outside in the cold end?
Face in the smoke and you’re lurching
Down the alleys, kiss me
And how many lives lived in fear now?
And who do we call in the end, end?
There was a pattern of errors
There was a life here to mend, mend
I wasn’t watching; the cold passed
Through my body slowly
And echoes of all wars are beaming
Rattling 'round in the end, end

No more doubt about it, oh

I wanna take you home
Take off your blindfold and show you what I am
I wanna take you home
And find some new joy in this autopilot life
I wanna take you home
Slow down your heartbeat and dry those glazing eyes
I wanna take you home
Blackout our windows and hold you 'til we die

I wanna take you home
Take off your blindfold and show you what I am
I wanna take you home
And find some new joy in this autopilot life
I wanna take you home
Slow down your heartbeat and dry those glazing eyes
I wanna take you home
And hold you 'til we die

Oh Lord, I’m sorry1Embed
