Siren (Never Let You Go) LyricsI knew when I met you I would not forget you
I knew I'd never let you go, oh
I knew that it was you who
Did it with you voodoo
I'm never gonna let you go, oh , oh
Never let you go never let you
Have to let you know
I can't forget you oh oh oh
Abcdefghijklmnopqrst you
Never let you go never let you go
Never let you go have to let you know
Can't forget youEmbed
