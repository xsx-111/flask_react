Only You LyricsOnly only you can make me feel so insecurely
We're all going wrong it's a sign for you surely
You say I bring you down
Now I'll turn the tables round
I say you bring me down
Only you can feel so badly so badly
Paranoia soul destroyer
Conspiracy you're out to get me
You are wearing a disguise
So the problems still arise
You are wearing a disguise
Only you can feel so sadly so sadly
Only you only you only you only you
Lady killer later night thriller
Frankenstein I'm on the line
Child bride knew no stress
Wide eyes and legless
Look at me I'm a mess
Over you so madly so madlyEmbed
