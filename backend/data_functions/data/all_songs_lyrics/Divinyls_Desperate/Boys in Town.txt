Boys in Town LyricsI am through with hanging 'round
With all the boys in town
Now I want a man around
Get me out of here
I am just a red brassiere
To all the boys in town
Put this bus in top gear
Get me out of here
I must have been desperate
I must have been pretty low
I must have been desperate
I must have been pretty low
I was always driving home
All the boys in town
But they never telephoned
Get me out of here
I think they're pretty phoney
You're not like the rest
You've heard of matrimony
They've all flunked the test
I must have been desperate
I must have been pretty low
I must have been desperate
I must have been pretty low
Oh, I'm tired
Oh, I'm wired
Oh, I'm tired
Oh, I'm wired
Ahhhhhh
Too much too young
Too much too young
Too much too young
Too much too young
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of hereEmbed
