Elsie Lyrics
She never had an education
She uses life as her vocation
Standing on ledges
Clinging to the edges
The world's a hard place to land on

She has this one-way conversation
Trying to avoid a confrontation
Memories of the kind
She'd rather leave behind
The world's a hard place to land on

Life can be lonely, life can be very sad
Life can be something you wish you never had

She never had any affection
So she relates well to rejection
No stories wait discovery
Dreams have passed recovery
The world's a hard place to land on

She just sleeps all day
In her squalid little slum
And takes little white pills
To make her body feel all numb
And it's dark and dirty
And there's nothing left to eat
And in her heart
There's a feeling of defeat
Smells of bugs and fornication
And a bottle of cheap scent
Should she stick around
If this is all that life meant?
Life can be lonely, life can be very sad
Life can be something you wish you never had

Open the door, Wally
Open the doorEmbed
