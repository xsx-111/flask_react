Victoria LyricsLooking at you so much to see
Eyes divining look back to me
Victoria, Victoria
From my outside point of view
I look into this world of you
Victoria, Victoria
Oh, and I want to show want to show you no harm
And I want to ask you, when will you show your charm?
Victoria, Victoria
Euphoria, euphoria
Victoria
Stories coming from me to you
We're tourists talking. so much to do
Euphoria, Victoria
From my outside point of view
I look into this world of you
Victoria, VictoriaEmbed
