Only Lonely LyricsWell I feel alright when it comes daylight
But when it comes the night
I am only lonely I am only lonely
And if it doesn't feel right when I hold you tight
Oh baby it's alright I am only lonely
Oooh, baby wonder if we could get involved
Oooh, baby wonder if we could get involved
And if it doesn't feel right when it comes daylight
But when it comes the night I am only lonely
He said come on baby, not on the first date
So I said ok baby, how long must I wait?
And if it doesn't feel right when it comes daylight
But when it comes the night I am only lonely
And if it doesn't feel right when I hold you tight
I am only lonely
Wonder could we get involvedEmbed
