Science Fiction LyricsI thought that love was science fiction
Until I saw you today
Now that love is my addiction
I've thrown all my books away
I thought that love was science fiction
Until I saw you today
Now that love is my addiction
I've thrown all my books away
When I was young I was so naive
I didn't believe no I didn't believe
I didn't believe
Never thought that we'd last this long
Always thought that they'd dropped the bomb
Drop the bomb (didn't)

I thought that love was science fiction
Until I saw you today
Now that love is my addiction
I've thrown all my books away
When I was young I was so naive
I didn't believe no I didn't believe
I didn't believe
I've been waiting for a man from space
To come to earth to meet the human race
The human race (didn't)
