Take a Chance LyricsYou better find you some people
Find you some people who know
You better find you some people
Who have got something to show
You better not listen to scandal
You know it ain't worth that much
You better find something to scandle
Find something you can touch
Losers words that you heard
Losers shame losers blame
Don't take side objectify
Watch out
Lovers words that you heard
Lovers shame losers blame
Dont' take sides objectify
Verse 1
Daughters & sons the desperate ones
Take a chance take a chance
Dont' break down don't break down
Take a chance
Don't break downEmbed
