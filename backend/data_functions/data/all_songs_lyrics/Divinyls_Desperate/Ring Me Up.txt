Ring Me Up LyricsYou are my desire
Oh baby you you you you make me cry
You are my desire
You you you you you make me cry
Got to find you, know your out there
Got to get you back into my hair
You just got to try cause I can't get you
Know you're out there know you've got a heart
Your gonna send me right back to the start
I really miss you and I feel so sad
Oh oh oh I ya oh oh oh I ya
Come on ring come on ring me come on ring me up
I am sitting here all alone
Waiting my by telephone
Wish I didn't leave it you
Ringing you I'm always having to
You are my desire
Oh baby you you you make me cry
Ifyou still up we could go down
We could make up when you came around
I really miss you and I feel so bad
If you're in bed I'll come to you instead
It will be alright when you come tonight
You just got try and I feel so sadEmbed
