Mr Moon LyricsMr Moon I like the way you think
Let's sit a while and have another drink
You can tell me how the new will rise
How the old will sink
Open my eyes and make me wise
Don't fall from the sky just yet
Cause it won't be long enough to make me strong
Mr Moon you walk upon the water
You shine like oil on machinery
You're sharper than a knife
And I'll love you all my life
Don't leave me here alone
Please take me with you
Mr Moon you drive the brightest car
Don't change I want you just the way yu are
We'll stop off at some night spot
And they'll think that you're a star
But who cares what the people think
Don't leave me alone tonight
Cause I need so much to feel your golden touch
Mr Moon you walk upon the water
You shine like oil on machinery
You're sharper than a knife
And I'll love you all my life
Don't leave me here alone
Please take me with youEmbed
