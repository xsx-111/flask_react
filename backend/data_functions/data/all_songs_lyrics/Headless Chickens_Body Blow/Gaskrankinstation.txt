Gaskrankinstation LyricsMy name's Ivan. My occupation?
Well I've been working tenty years at the gaskrankinstation downtown
I love the cars, y'know
Without me they wouldn't go very far
I like the smell
I like my work
But my wife, she makes me feel like such a jerk when I can't
Get it up
Sometimes I look at her and I don't feel anybody in there
I got a cat. Called Ed
Aw, he's a vicious little bugger when it comes to being fed
I got a tv set or two
But we'll have to get a man in 'cause one of them blew up
Maybe. One day
I might just take up the piano again, but aw, you know
What the hell
Most of the time everything is just swell around here
I got a couple of friends and they're both called Dave, y'know
Sometimes those guys just dunno how to behave
They get drunk and boy you just can't take 'em anywhere
But my wife
Don't approve
And she keeps on asking me when we're gonna move
Why can't we have a child?
Sometimes I wonder why I never managed to knock some sense into her
Aw, shit
You know what I'm talking about
As long as my heart keeps thumpin'
I guess I'll keep on pumpin' gas
Sometimes I wonder
If there really is a God
But when I walk
Home from work
Well I usually go by that big new church
And that young priest's eyes are shining bright
I look but I don't see anybody in there
At night. I watch the news
But I like the lady newsreader more than the reviews of the day
What are they on about?
I wish I knew all the facts
But I'm much too tired to think
And my head is looking down from the edge of a brink
That's my body
Sometimes I sit in myself and I don't feel anybody in thereEmbed
