Juice LyricsBack in '77
When everything was so tall
I used to watch that tv show
That I now can't recall
This is the feeling
I taste in my dreams
When the child was a child
Was a child
Waking up in the darkness
I know I've felt this way before
Sunday morning children's show
Always wanting more
This is the feeling
I taste in my dreams
When the child was a child
Was a childEmbed
