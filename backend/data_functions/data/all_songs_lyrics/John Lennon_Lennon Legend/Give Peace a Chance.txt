Give Peace a Chance Lyrics
Two
A-one, two, three four, ugh

Everybody's talking about
Bagism, Shagism, Dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism
This-ism, that-ism, ism ism ism

All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance

(Come on)
Everybody's talking about
Minister, Sinister, Banisters and Canisters
Bishops, Fishops, Rabbis, and Pop Eyes, Bye bye, Bye byes

All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance

(Let me tell you now)
Everybody's talking about
Revolution, Evolution, Masturbation, Flagellation, Regulation
Integrations, mediations, United Nations, congratulations
All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance

Everybody's talking about
John and Yoko, Timmy Leary, Rosemary
Tommy Smothers, Bobby Dylan, Tommy Cooper
Derek Taylor, Norman Mailer, Allen Ginsberg, Hare Krishna
Hare Hare Krishna

All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance
