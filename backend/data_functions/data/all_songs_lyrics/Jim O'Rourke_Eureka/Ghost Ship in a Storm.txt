Ghost Ship in a Storm LyricsNothing makes me want to disappear as when someone opens their mouth
It's just my luck, I get hit by a car while carrying a cake
Dripping cherries onto the pavement, bride and groom on my face
I'm not there like a ghost ship in a storm
It only figures that I'd ride my bike into wet cement
And as I'm sinkin', the last thing that I think is did I pay my rent?
I ride through like a ghost ship in a storm2Embed
