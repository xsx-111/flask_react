Happy Holidays LyricsI'm going to a place
Where the women have nothing on
But the radio
Turned up to 10
Too loud for me to think
I'm hoping if I blink
I don't wake up here
One of life's greatest sins
Is that you're over when it begins
Goodbye, Mouth Canyon
You weren't very much to see
But I only came to leaveEmbed
