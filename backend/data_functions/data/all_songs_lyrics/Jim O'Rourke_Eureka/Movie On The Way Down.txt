Movie On The Way Down LyricsThere's that word again
Pride
Do you pride yourself on being
Polite?
Do you feel pride when you're alone?
Does the mirror say good day, today?
Does your family make you feel pride?
Do their pictures keep you warm?
Is your smile so easily worn?
Worn away
Do you feel proud?Embed
