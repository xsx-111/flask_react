Something Big LyricsLike a grain of sand
That wants to be
A rolling stone
I want to be the man
I'm not
And have the things
I really haven't got
And that's a lot
There'll be joy
And there'll be laughter
Something big is what I'm after now
Yes, it's what I'm after now
After taking
Take up giving
Something big is what I'm living for
Yes, it's what I'm living for
Living for
Why must I go on
And fill my life with little things
When there are big things I must do
And lots of dreams
That really should come true
Before I'm through
There'll be joy
And there'll be laughter
Something big is what I'm after now
Yes, it's what I'm after now
After taking
Take up giving
Something big is what I'm living for
Yes, it's what I'm living for
Living forEmbed
