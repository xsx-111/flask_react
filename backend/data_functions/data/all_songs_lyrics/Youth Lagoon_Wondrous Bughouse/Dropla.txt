Dropla LyricsEternal cave, one made of drapes
They hand you perfume from your personal maid
Whose scrubs make her arms look too big for her frame
For the life of me I can't remember her name
I'm praying to speak, accept my song
And most use prayers to keep a good health
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
I live in a thought, one that's homemade
While my physical body is turning in my grave
The spirit's forgiven, building in your brain
But I doesn't know how!
I reach my arm across the bed and hold your hand
The angel of state can't wait to seize all your land
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You weren't there when I needed
You are gone, you're going under
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never die, you will never die
You will never dieEmbed
