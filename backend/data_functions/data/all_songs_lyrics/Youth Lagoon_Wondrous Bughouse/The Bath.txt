The Bath Lyrics
The water talks to me
It teaches me to swim
Watching myself bathe
Without ever going in
The current sings to me
In crowning harmony
A reel without film
To watch is not to see

If doomsday's coming, let the earth attack
And while the crowd is running, I'll be here instead. The village green, far from the beachhead
Your demon met me here. (x3)

I'm watching smoke
Billow from my mouth
I take off my shirt
This river flows South
The stranger's a deer
Camping in the foothills
It lived another year
Without becoming roadkill
