Attic Doctor LyricsI don't mean any harm
You can trust me like you would trust your own brother
But he is much nicer
"I won't die easily"
That's what they say when I erupt into laughter
The doctor puts on a face to tell her she couldn't have babies
To tell her she couldn't have babies
I don't mean any harm
You can trust me like you would trust your own brother
Maybe even better
"I won't die easily"
That's what you said after you watched the disease spread
The doctor conceals a grin to tell her she couldn't have babies
To tell her she couldn't have babies1Embed
