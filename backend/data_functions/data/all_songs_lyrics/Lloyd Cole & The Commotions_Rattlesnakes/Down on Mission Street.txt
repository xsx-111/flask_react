Down on Mission Street LyricsSome say that you may soon be leaving town
Do you tire of chasing all the women around?
Will you never be contented with your life
Will you always be the one who won't think twice?
When you go down on your knees
You're so hard to please
When you go down on your knees
You're so hard down on Mission Street
God only knows how you can hurt her
When you know that's what you do
How does it feel to be so cruel?
Will you never be contented with your life
Will you always be the one who won't look back?
When you go down on your knees
You're so hard to please
When you go down on your knees
It feels like up down on Mission Street
Julie said your eyes are blue
Your lips are cold as stone
She picked you up and you put her down
And messed her place around
Will you never be contented with your life
Will you always be the one who won't think twice?
When you go down on your knees
You're so hard to please
When you go down on your knees
You're so hard down on Mission Street
When you go down on your knees
You're so hard to please
When you go down on your knees
It feels like up down on Mission StreetEmbed
