Speedboat LyricsJulie said we're drinking far too much coffee
Wine and cigarettes and we'll never get no sleep
I first met them at a riverboat party
Both of them were speeding I would say
I lived on the edge of all this indulgence
Taking notes and trusting in prudence
Julie said to Jim why don't we jump in
While the water is cool and we are still friends
Some say that they O.D.'d on Leonard Cohen
Well, I can see that river whenever I think about them
The river is cruel and the water is deep and blue
I was working then on my great unfinished novel
Please let me introduce myself my name is Ronald
I was okay there until I lost my cool
Now let me introduce you to the rest of the crew
It wasn't my style to find surf in my eye
It was much more my style to find sand in my eye
Though there is absolutely no truth to be discovered
Albeit true that there is nothing to be found
We academics are not easily discouraged
Lord, you know wits they come three to the pound
Julie said to Jim look at the state we're in
It was never her intention to conclude anything
It wasn't my style to find surf in my eye
It was much more my style to find sand in my eye
It was just not my style to find surf in my eye
It was much more my style to get sand kicked in my eye
Sand in my eye...Embed
