Patience LyricsEarly in the morning just by the break of day
That's when my Patience went away
She took her bags but she left all her clothes
She took her keys and left me out in the cold
Wearing a plastic coat
And the pressures of life
Through lack of Patience
I get the pressures of love
Patience is a girl that I hate to love the way I do...but I do
She wakes me up in the morning through screaming in my dreams
She took her bags but she left all her clothes
She took her keys and left me out in the cold
All because of Patience
I get the pressures of life
Through lack of Patience
I get the pressures of love
She beat me up and left me out in the pouring rain
Without no keys without no reason to go back again
She left me empty-handed she left me empty-hearted
Not no money not nothing but the blues
All because of Patience
I get the pressures of life
Through lack of Patience
I get the pressures of love
She said the one thing that she needs is happiness
I don't believe that she's happy until she sees that I'm in distress
No...all because of Patience
I get the pressures of life
Through lack of Patience
I get the pressures of love
...and I swoonEmbed
