You Will Never Be No Good LyricsYou will never be no good
No, you will never be no good
Do you know what I'd do if I could
Chop you up into the firewood
Because you have sinned far too many times
You have sinned far too many times
And you will pay for all your crimes
You will never be no good, not, not ever no good
You know it's hard to sympathize
You know it's hard to sympathize
When you never tell nothing but lies
And it's hard to sympathize
You say you're born in the barrel of a gun
Some say you're born in the barrel of a gun
You were your mother's seventh son
And no excuse would be a good enough one
And don't you love her madly
You want to be her daddy
Well, that won't do you no good
You might just slip into the priesthood
You will never be no good
No, you will never be no good
Do you know what I'd do if I could
Then we'd all receive a knighthood
You'll be never no good
You'll never, never be no good
You'll never, never be no good
You'll never, never be no good
You'll never, never be no good
You'll never, never, never
You'll never, never, never
You'll never, never, never
Never, never, never, never, never, neverEmbed
