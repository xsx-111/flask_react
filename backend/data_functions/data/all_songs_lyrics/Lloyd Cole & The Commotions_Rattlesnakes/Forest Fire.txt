Forest Fire LyricsShe crossed herself as she put on her things
She has promised once before not to live this way
If she don't calm down she will burn herself out
Like a forest fire, well doesn't that make you smile?
If you don't slow down I swear that I'll come round
And mess up your place let's go for a spin
They say we shouldn't even know each other
And that we'll be undone
Don't it make you smile like a forest fire?
I believe in love. I'll believe in anything
That's going to get me what I want and get me off my knees
And then we'll burn your house down
Don't it feel so good?
There's a forest fire every time we get together
We're going to pick you up - put you down
Rip you up and spin you round
Just like we said we would
Because we're a forest fire
Believe we be - we'll tear this place down
If we get caught in this wind then we could burn the ocean
If we get caught in this scene we're going to be undone
It's just a simple metaphor it's for a burning love
Don't it make you smile like a forest fire?Embed
