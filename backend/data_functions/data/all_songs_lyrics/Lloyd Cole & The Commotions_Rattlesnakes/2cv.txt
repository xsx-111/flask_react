2cv LyricsShe drove her mother's car, it was a deux chevaux
I was most impressed by her casual dress
I was most impressed
Inside a rented room coloured deepest blue
I suppose we found some kind of happiness
To fill the emptiness
We were simply wasting precious time
Hiding from the cruelest summer sky
She took her mother's car to get away from me
Heaven knows that I, I can sympathize
Oh, I can sympathize
For we were never close if the truth were told
All we ever shared was a taste in clothes
No, we were never close
We were simply losing everything
Underneath the cruelest London sun
We were simply wasting precious time
We were simply wasting precious time
We were simply wasting precious timeEmbed
