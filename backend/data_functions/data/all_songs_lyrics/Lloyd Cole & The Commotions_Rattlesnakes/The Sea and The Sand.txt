The Sea and The Sand LyricsOnce there was the sea now there is sand
And no way now to wash these aching limbs
We have been brothers to this land
All of our boats have long been burned
Lord take this weight out of my bones
Your seventh sin may still yet be unlearned
Though I may burn out in the sand
Still I will learn to love this land
But if the world is truly turned
Surely then our hearts will burn again
And the sand will turn to soil
And the blood run in our veins again
And burn again
Once there was the sea now there is sand
And no way now to wash these aching limbs
Still, you will take me by the hand
Yet I will learn to love this land
But if the world is truly turned
Surely then our luck will turn within
And the sand will turn to soil
And the blood run in our veins again
And burn againEmbed
