Four Flights Up LyricsI was woken up at 4 AM by your screams and anguished cries
Your mother was singing in the bathroom
She will never be my child
Oh, baby talks in her sleep so loud
We're living four flights up
But I swear right now
It feels like underground
You have absolutely no common sense
Yes I know that's your charm
You spend the whole day on the phone
You say well it helps you stay calm
You cling to my arm yes I know that's your charm
And when I ask you what you want you say a diamante crocodile
Well then could you give me some peace
You say, "Well maybe for a while"
Sometimes you know you could almost be a child
Oh, must you tell me all your secrets
When it's hard enough to love you knowing nothing
We're living four flights up
But I swear right now
It feels like underground
You are your own worst enemy
So don't expect my sympathy
Oh, go back to your mother's house
And cry your little heart out
You came driving back to town
In a beat up Grace Kelly car
Looking like a friend of Truman Capote
Looking exactly like you are
Yes, I know that's your charm
So don't ask me if I want you only ask me if I must
I've been blown around so long
Don't know which senses to trust
Oh no.. but I know that I must
Oh, must you tell me all your secrets
When it's hard enough to love you knowing nothing
We're living four flights up
But I swear right now
It feels like undergroundEmbed
