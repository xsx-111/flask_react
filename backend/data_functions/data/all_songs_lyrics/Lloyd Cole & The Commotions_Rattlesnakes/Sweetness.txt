Sweetness LyricsOh, you're a precious little pearl
But tell me true now, have you ever had a care in the world?
So tell me what's it all about?
You say "Oh, you're so uptight"
Well, you'll never be so right
Oh, you can cry yourself dry
But I'd be surprised if you can muster up a single crocodile
You'll never be the hopeless child
Throw caution to the wind
Forgive yourself your sins
And don't you know, you really are the sweetest thing
There isn't heart enough in you
Do you no longer care or feel that you have nothing left to prove?
Oh, tell me that it isn't true
I wanted to tell you
That I used to admire you
Oh, you know you don't mean that I never cared
No, I never cared for you
But I used to read about you and you offered me youth
Throw caution to the wind
And don't you know, you really are the sweetest thingEmbed
