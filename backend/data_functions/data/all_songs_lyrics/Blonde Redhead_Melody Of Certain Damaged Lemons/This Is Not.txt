This Is Not LyricsOnce she loved a boy. But he did not love her
His name was Jun. Disillusioned she tried to forget
So she left everything and traveled to the other world
But life was like a dream
A series of meaningless movement
And then by chance she met you and your brother
The moment she saw you
She knew you were made for her
You're never out of her thoughts. She sees only you
[If it was yesterday he'd felt free just like her
He could have been with her
But today can't be anymore
Tomorrow maybe yes. But today he is not there] x2
I heard someone say
The mind keeps wandering from desire to contempt
From contempt to desire
Never ever feeling bored. Cause we think we are free
I think it's so pathetic. Don't you?
Were you listening to me. No, not even one word
I heard someone say, "The mind keeps wandering"
Life is like a dream. A series of meaningless movement
I heard someone say
Let's go to the other world
Cuz we think we are free. A series of meaningful
Movement
