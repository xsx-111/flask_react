Loved Despite of Great Faults LyricsYou will move
With me we will
Stay still and
Words will move around us
Surround us in gold
And in our world
We will be silent
You will swim
To me we will
Be free
And words will move around us
Swim around us
Surround us in schools
And in our cool
We'll be reminded
That you refuse to fade away
I hide to stay the same
Where do we go from here
I don't know
For me you flower to be chosen
I fall down to be noticed
Where do we go from here
I don't know...
It was a time
A way of life
The only secrets
We talked about
Were all the fears
In all these years
We spent together
That you refuse to fade away
I hide to stay the same
Where do we go from here
I don't know...1Embed
