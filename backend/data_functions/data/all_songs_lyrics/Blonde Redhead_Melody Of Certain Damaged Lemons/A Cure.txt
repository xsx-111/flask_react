A Cure LyricsEverybody knows he is a pleaser
Nothing else than just a teaser
Teaser of his own faint smile
Yes and how he's so amusing
Smiling can be so consuming
And so strange to explain
Oh I know how I think I might
Have known of you somehow and
What your name was
Like any other man in many ways he's not
Like life itself a mystery or two
Hey, Mr. Pleaser, would you smile for me?
Yes and how many times he hasn't
Spoken just to please not to displease
Please her if you please
Oh I see how his life resembles
Yours and you somehow are like him
I see I know I've been too good for you
You know he's just like me
Pleasing you and now all
You do is wish
I was more and more like him
If so would you consider keeping me closer?
I know...
He turns his head and doesn't see you
But when he does he looks to greet you
"How are you? Good luck!!"
So now I call myself a pleaser
This time sitting on a secret
One secret everybody knows
Oh I see how
His life resembles yours
And you somehow are like him
I see I know I've been too good for you
You know, you know that he is just like me
Pleasing you and now
And now all you do is wish
I was more and more like him
If so would you consider keeping me
Closer if so, you know if I was more and more like him
If so would you consider keeping me closer? I know
I know if I was more and more like him. If so..Embed
