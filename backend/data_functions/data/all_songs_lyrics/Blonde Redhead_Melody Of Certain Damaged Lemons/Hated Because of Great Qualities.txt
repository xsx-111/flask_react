Hated Because of Great Qualities LyricsSecret, so sorry, but I forgot
Secret, secret, we are bound to forget
I was worried I might be rude to you
So worried that I was
It's a lie to serve the truth
And I'm still guilty
Oh, I missed
So be it
Everywhere, everything you ever touch
Cutting it won't do it
There's nothing to it
You were sorry that I was alone
So sorry you rode away
Putting it on me, but you already knew it
Oh, it never meant a thing
So be it
I can't understand this at all
I can't pronounce this at all
These are different matters
These are uncertain feelings
These should never be discussed here
So keep it to yourself
Oh, I missed
So be it
Everywhere, everything you ever touch
Cutting it won't do it
There's nothing to it
You were sorry that I was alone
So sorry you ran away
Putting it on me, but you already knew it
Oh it never meant a thing
So be it
I can't understand this at all
I can't pronounce this at all
These are different matters
These are uncertain feelings
These should never be discussed here
So keep it to yourself4Embed
