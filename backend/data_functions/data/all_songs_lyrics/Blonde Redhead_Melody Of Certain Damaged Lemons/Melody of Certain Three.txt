Melody of Certain Three Lyrics
Crawl, crawl as a child
Move like a man
Pushing like a father
Pulling like a friend

Whatever it takes forever it seems
But despite of all that all is well

Sexing like stone
Hot as the sand
Entering a life
Exiting with a man

Whatever it takes forever it seems
But despite of all that all is well

Sometimes i spin around for days
Skip and chase and say
Forget about tomorrow
Until i realize
This valid and logic motion
Is what keeps me from moving
I don't understand
Running running on tracks
With feet on the ground
It will only slow me down
And which way the wind blows
I run like a man ready to go anywhere
When i am so timid
You'll be my words
When i am most effective
You act like a stone
Whatever it takes forever it seems
But despite of all that all is wellEmbed
