Mother LyricsThere is a lady that I know
She sounds like sunlight on the snow
And she used to set me on her knee
Sayin? she loved only me
Oooh hooo
(Oooh hooo)
Oooh hooo
There came a time when I had to leave
Sayin? this of course made me grieve
Tryin? to be a man on my own
My thoughts come back to my home
Boomer you know you?re not forgotten
I think about you every day
And even though you wouldn?t recognize me now
You?d remember my voice anyway
There is a lady that I know
She sounds like sunlight on the snow
And she used to set me on her knee
Sayin? she loved only me
Oooh hooo
(Oooh hooo)
Oooh hooo
Oooh hooo
(Oooh hooo)
Oooh hoooEmbed
