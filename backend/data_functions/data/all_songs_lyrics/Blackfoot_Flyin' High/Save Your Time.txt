Save Your Time LyricsOooh Ya save your time and think it over
Spend your time with your wife or your lover
Lover wins can?t stand the pain
Lover wins and her days are filled with pain
And you know, yes you know that it?s so
Oooh Ya save your time and think it over
Spend your time with your friends and your lover
Neither can win they can?t stand the spin
Leave it until they feel no more pain
And you know, yes you know that it?s so
Lord you feel, yes you feel that it?s real
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Oooh Ya save your time and think it over
Spend your time with no one but your lover
Be with her in the bad times and the good
Be with her always like you know you should
And you know, yes you know that it?s so
Lord you feel, yes you feel that it?s real
Oh, oh, ohEmbed
