Madness LyricsWellllll, it?s one more morning and I open my eyes
I take a look around me Lord its no surprise
I?m cold and hurtin? lord its all the same
No one to help me lord there?s no one to blame
I got the madness and it?s growing in my bones
No one to help me lord I?m all alone
Yeah I can feel another high its coming soon
Well I?m thinkin? baby this one?s a moon
So this is madness
That?s what this is
I can?t have any gladness
You get away from here
Ooooh, I listen to people today, every day
And I tell ya I?m going to soak it away
Been playin my music since I was only thirteen
So won?t you help me lord, you know it?s a dream
So if you ever get some wine come with me
Don?t worry momma you can count on me
I got a feelin? that it won?t be long till I
Cry the moon a little whole
So this is madness
That?s what this is
I can?t have any gladness
You get away from me
Ohhhhhhhh
Soooo, if you get me two people today, every day
Time to tell you I?m gonna soak it away
Keep messin? ?round and it won?t be long
Till all your friends who admire themselves be comin? on strong
So if you ever get some wine come with me
Don?t worry momma you can count on me
I got a feelin? that it won?t be long till I
Cry the moon a little whole
So this is madness
So this is
I can?t have any gladness
You get away from meEmbed
