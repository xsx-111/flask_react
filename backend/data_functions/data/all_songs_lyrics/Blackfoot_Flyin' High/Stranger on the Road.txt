Stranger on the Road LyricsYeah-ah I like that yell
Well I'm just a stranger on the open road
Always seem to find a way
It doesn't matter what you may come
Lord I'm never gonna say
A livin' hard and a runnin' wild
Always make my claim to fame
Don't turn around cause I'll be gone
Lookin' back
Someone's callin' my name
Can't you see that there is no one to blame
Lookin' back
You're caught in the flame
Well when I was young
My daddy hit your feet
Don't you ever stay in one place
Said your chances of knowin'
And becoming a man
Got a big smile on your face
With your head in the air
And your feet on the ground
We got a chance of stayin' alive
Well because rock was just lookin' me down
Said Bye, bye, bye, bye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Ohhhh oh
Lookin' back
Someone's callin' my name
Can't you see that there is no one to blame
Lookin' back
You're caught in the flame
Well I guess your children will never know
That everything you say is doomed
I'm a stange kind a fella, Lordy don't you know
I never step on anyone's shoes
With your head in the air
And your feet on the ground
We got a chance of stayin' alive
Well take a tip from me why don'cha try to be free
Lawd I'm just a stranger on the open road
