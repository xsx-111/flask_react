Island of Life LyricsOooh lord no
Goddamn
When your world is passing you by
You're feelin' getting late
You want to find a key that will open up
Those silver gates
You keep thinkin' that I gave it up
And in every little way
Here I come again
Oooh don'cha know
Wind blows across the sand
And there's a sleepin' haze
Seems most like it always has
And I think of better days
Oh and last year about this time
I got myself a daze
The island that I was searchin' for
Was just a breeze away
Keep thinkin' that I shook it off
And in every little way
Whatcha think I don't know no better
Oh oh don'cha know
There's a reason to see
There's a reason to life
But our heart's in your hand
You hardly know it's alive
Ahhh Wahoo
Sing a song of seven years
And I sing a song of my way
I sing a song oh baby for you
Show you how I play
I keep thinkin' that I'll wake up
And find myself alone
On an island full of promises
Standin' all on my own
You keep thinkin' that I gave it up
And in every little way
Here I come again
Don'cha know
Ooooh YeahhhEmbed
