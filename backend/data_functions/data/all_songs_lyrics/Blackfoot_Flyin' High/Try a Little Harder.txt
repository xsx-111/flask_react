Try a Little Harder LyricsWatch your brain as it dries away
Bringin' new life on some people today-ay
I've tried so hard to keep from crying' so-oo
I've tried to tell myself to let you go
See you sittin' on your throne now
Tell me baby, what you see
Yeah. Anybody of the people
Oh oh. Oh tellin' lies about me-ee
Watch the sun as it rises kind of slow
Shining on the people now, letting it know
There's gonna come a time now when?
When I've tried
And you see how all your friends now baby
All of the lies
Try a little harder (oooh)
Make a smile
Try a little harder (oooh)
All-ll the while
Try a little harder (oooh)
Bring a sunny day. Yeah
Try a little harder to come my way-ay-ay
Ohhh as soon rises the starshine
Is gonna come a cloudy day-ay
Ohhh and the rain that you make now
Gonna wash me away-ay (Ayyyy)
Try a little harder (oooh)
Make a smile
Try a little harder (oooh)
All-ll the while
Try a little harder (oooh)
Bring a sunny day. Yeah, yeah
Try a little harder to come my way-ay-ay
Yeah baby
Would you try a little harderEmbed
