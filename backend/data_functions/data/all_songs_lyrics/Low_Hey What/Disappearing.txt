Disappearing Lyrics
Somewhere out on the ocean
Across the waves, the rise and fall
Deep beyond imagination
Some kind of madness, I don't know

Every time I see that ship go out
It feels like everything's complete
But somebody somewhere is waiting
Some other ocean at her feet

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na

That disappearing horizon
It brings cold comfort to my soul
An ever-present reminder
The constant face of the unknown, unknownEmbed
