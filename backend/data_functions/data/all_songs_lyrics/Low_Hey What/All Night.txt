All Night Lyrics
All night
All night
All night
All night

All night
You fought the adversary
It was no ordinary fight

In flight
Inferring on the silent
I tried to make my mind add up


Don't hide
Your secret's safe inside
I see a shadow in your eyes

Come find
Held up and tripped behind it
I tried to be so quiet
All night
All night
All night
All night

All night
You fought the adversary
It was no ordinary fight

All night
All night
All night
All night
All night
All night
All night
All night
All night
All night
All night
All nightEmbed
