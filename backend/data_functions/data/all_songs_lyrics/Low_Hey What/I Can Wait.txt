I Can Wait Lyrics
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait, I can wait, I can wait
But I can't wait for it all
And I can't wait too long

I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake
Must be another day
How long must I wait?


How you say, how you say, how you say, how you say, how you say?
I can't sail any more
Like a ship to the shore

I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
A mistake has been made
There's a price to be paid


If I could trade, I could trade, I would trade, I would trade, I would trade
I would give you a break
Help you carry the weight
I can take, I can take, I can take, I can take, I can take
And I can give it away
I could leave or stay

My mistake, my mistake, my mistake, my mistake, my mistake
Just get me out of thе way
Somebody else takе the stage


All night
All night
All nightEmbed
