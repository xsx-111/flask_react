Hey Lyrics
Hey

Hey
We didn't get past Michigan and Lake
Before we found ourselves beneath the weight
Hey
Told me that I never could contain
Went back and wept in the car beneath the shade
Hey
What does it cost you to give it away?
You never wanted it any other way
Hey
Speaking more and asked that you should pray
Maybe that's the last thing you should say
Hey


Hey
We didn't get past Michigan and Lakе
Before we found oursеlves beneath the weight
Hey
Told me that I never could contain
Went back and wept in the car beneath the shade
Hey
What does it cost you to give it away?
You never wanted it any other way
Hey
Speaking more and asked that you should pray
Maybe that's the last thing you should say
Hey
