White Horses Lyrics
The consequences of leaving
Would be more cruel than if I should stay
Though it's impossible to say I know
Still, white horses take us home


There isn't much past believing
Only a fool would have had the faith
Though it's impossible to say I know
Still, white horses take us home

Still, white horses take us home
Still, white horses take us home
Still, white horses take us home
Still, white horses take us home
Still, white horses take us home
