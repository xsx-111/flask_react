Days Like These LyricsWhen you think you've seen everything
You'll find we're living in days like these
They say you only take what you bring
Maybe that's just the way they speak
Know that I would do anything
Is it something that I can't see?
Everybody just chased by dreams
That's why we're living in days like these again
It isn't something you can choose between
It isn't coming in twos and threes
Always looking for that one sure thing
Oh, you wanted so desperately
No, you're never gonna feel complete
No, you're never gonna be released
Maybe never even see, believe
That's why we're living in days like these again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
