The Price You Pay (It Must Be Wearing Off) Lyrics
I put a lot of thought
Into the price you pay
To hear the morning come
Keep the ghost another day

I don't have to pause
To feel the magic burn
Deep within my heart
'Neath the surface of the earth

And I know what they want
To forget the hurt
But either side you're on
You get what you deserve
Take you at your word


And I know what you want
To forget the hurt
But either side you're on
It's not what you deserve
Take you at your word
I know it sounds absurd
I know it sounds absurd
I know it sounds absurd


It must be wearing off
It must be wearing off
It must bะต wearing off
It must be wearing off
