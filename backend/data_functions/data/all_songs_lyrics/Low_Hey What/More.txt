More Lyrics
I gave more than what I should've lost
I paid more than what it would've cost
You have some of what I could've had
I want all of what I didn't have

Oh, ooh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Oh, ooh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

I learned more than what they ever taught
They thought I could never pull it off
I saw more than what I ever sought
I should have asked for more than what I got

Oh, ooh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Oh, ooh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Oh, ooh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Oh, ooh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Oh, ooh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Oh, ooh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Oh, ooh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Oh, ooh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)Embed
