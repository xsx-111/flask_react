A Wasted Life LyricsI know you're walking down a lonely street
I know you can't get out of the heat
Baby, it's alright, don't have a wasted life
I know you have to feel a little used up
And no one can give you enough
Baby, hold on tight, don't have a wasted life
I love you too much
Don't have a wasted life
I love you too much
Don't have a wasted life
Don't have a wasted life
They give it to you from the time you're born
You keep trying to make one more score
Baby, alright, you got to stand and fight
So when you're lonely and you feel let down
You can call me, I'll come around and treat you nice
Don't have a wasted life
I love you too much
Don't have a wasted life
I love you too much
They give it to you from the time you're born
Someone's got to put the pressure on
Baby, alright, you got to stand and fight
So when you're lonely and you feel let down
You can call me, I'll come around and treat you nice
Don't have a wasted life
I love you too much
Don't have a wasted life
I love you too much
Don't have a wasted life
I love you too much
Don't have a wasted life
Don't have a wasted lifeEmbed
