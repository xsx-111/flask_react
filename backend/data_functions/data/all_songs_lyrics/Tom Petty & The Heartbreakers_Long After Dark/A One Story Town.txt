A One Story Town LyricsI'm for standing up, I'm breaking free
I don't want fate handed down to me
Yeah I'm for moving on to try another town
Time ain't changing nothing, take a look around
Oh, I'm lost in a one story town
Where everything's close to the ground
Yeah the same shit goes down
Nothing turns around
It's a one story town
She was only seventeen, but I held her to her word
Had to push her luck and thought she couldn't burn
No it didn't hurt me when she had to leave
She had a faraway feeling, wasn't part of me
Oh, I'm lost in a one story town
Where everything's close to the ground
Yeah the same shit goes down
Nothing turns around
It's a one story town
Yeah, I'm lost in a one story town
Where everything's close to the ground
Yeah the same shit goes down
Nothing turns around
It's a one story town1Embed
