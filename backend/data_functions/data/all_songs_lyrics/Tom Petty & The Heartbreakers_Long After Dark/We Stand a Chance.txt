We Stand a Chance LyricsStand back from me, honey
Because I don't know what I might do next
No I'm surprised by this, frightened by this
Nothing ever got me so out of my head, baby
We stand a chance
Baby, we stand a chance
Yeah, and I could be wrong, but you never know
We could stand the chance of a real love
Oh, God knows I love you, God knows I do
Baby, will you let me just prove it to you?
Come here to me, baby, come here to me now
I want to talk to you, talk to you and tell you somehow
That we stand a chance
Baby, we stand a chance
Yeah, and I could be wrong, but you never know
We could stand the chance of a real love
I'm so moved, I'm so changed
Baby, my whole world is a fountain of flame
Baby, we stand a chance
Baby, we stand a chance
Yeah, and I could be wrong, but you never know
We could stand a chance of a real love
I'm so moved, I'm so changed
Baby, my whole world is a fountain of flame
Baby, we stand a chance
Baby, we stand a chance
Yeah, and I could be wrong, but you never know
We could stand a chance of a real loveEmbed
