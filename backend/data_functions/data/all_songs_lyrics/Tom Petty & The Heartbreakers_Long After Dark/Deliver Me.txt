Deliver Me LyricsEvery woman and every man
Knows the feeling so well
Those times when the heart just can't understand
The times when you never can tell
So deliver me, deliver me
Baby, take this heart, set it free
Take this chance, take this dream
Baby, take this heart, deliver me
Well, I was born with something down inside of me
And it's carried me over, delivered me
Yeah delivered me, I'm standing at your gate
Just out of reach of the hands of fate
So deliver me, deliver me
Baby, take this heart, set it free
Take this chance, take this dream
Baby, take this heart, deliver me
Sometimes I wonder if this is worth the trouble
Sometimes I wonder if this is worth the fight
I never have made my mind up about it
I've just decided to let it all ride, let it all ride, let it all ride
So deliver me, deliver me
Baby, take this heart and set it free
Take this chance, take this dream
Baby, take this heart, deliver me
Baby, take this heart, deliver me
Baby, take this heart, deliver meEmbed
