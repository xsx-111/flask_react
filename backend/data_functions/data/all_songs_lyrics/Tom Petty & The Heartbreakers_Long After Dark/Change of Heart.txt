Change of Heart LyricsWell I fought for you
I fought too hard
To do it all again, babe
It's gone too far
You never needed me
You only wanted me around
It gets me down
There's been a change
Yeah there's been a change of heart
Said there's been a change
You pushed just a little too far
You made it just a little too hard
There's been a change of heart
I'll get over you
It won't take long
I've stood in your gallery
Seen what's hanging from the walls
You were the moon and sun
You're just a loaded gun now
It gets me down
There's been a change
Yeah there's been a change of heart
Said there's been a change
You pushed just a little too far
You made it just a little too hard
There's been a change of heart
What we've had all along
Looks like we finally found the turning point
Oh me oh my
Looks like it's time for me to kiss it goodbye
Kiss it goodbye
There's been a change
Yeah there's been a change of heart
Said there's been a change
You pushed just a little too far
You made it just a little too hard
There's been a change of heart1Embed
