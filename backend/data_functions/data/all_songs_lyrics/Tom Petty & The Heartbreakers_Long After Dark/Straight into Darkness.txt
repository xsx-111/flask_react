Straight into Darkness LyricsThere was a little girl, I used to know her
I still think about her time to time
There was a moment when I really loved her
Then one day the feeling just died
We went straight into darkness
Out over the line
Yeah straight into darkness
Straight into night
I remember flying out to London
I remember the feeling at the time
Out the window of the 747
Man, there was nothing, only black sky
We went straight into darkness
Out over the line
Yeah straight into darkness
Straight into night
Oh give it up to me, I need it
Girl, I know a good thing when I see it
Baby, wrong or right, I mean it
I don't believe the good times are over
I don't believe the thrill is all gone
Real love is a man's salvation
The weak ones fall, the strong carry on
Straight into darkness
Out over the line
Yeah straight into darkness
Straight into night
We went straight into darkness
Out over the line
We went straight into darkness
Straight into nightEmbed
