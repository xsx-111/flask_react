Between Two Worlds LyricsI got a dirty, dirty feeling that I just can't shake
Yeah my brain keeps burning and my body just aches
Yea I know a woman's body is only flesh and bone
A woman's body is only flesh and bone
How come I can't let go?
I'm between two worlds
I said oh yeah (oh yeah) out of my mind
I'm between two worlds
There's lot of talk about the danger zone
There's adventure novels about taking to the road
Yea I know a woman's body is only flesh and bone
I know a woman's body is only flesh and bone
How come I can't let go?
I'm between two worlds
Yea I know a woman's body is only flesh and bone
A woman's body is only flesh and bone
How come I can't let go?
I'm between two worlds
I said oh yeah (oh yeah) out of my mind
I'm between two worlds
Oh yea yea out of my mind
I'm between two worlds
I'm between two worlds
I'm between two worlds
I'm between two worlds
Oh yea yea out of my mind
I'm between two worldsEmbed
