The Same Old You LyricsHey, I remember you back in '72
With your David Bowie hair and your platform shoes
Your part-time job selling fast food
But out on the street, you was nobody's fool
Baby, way down deep, it's the same old you
Way down deep, you ain't hiding the truth
Just for a minute, you had me fooled
But baby, way down deep, it's the same old you
Well you can walk through the city on fire
You can try and turn away from the truth
Living life like a young politician
Sure of yourself and bulletproof
But baby, way down deep, it's the same old you
Way down deep, you ain't hiding the truth
Just for a minute, you had me confused
Baby, way down deep, it's the same old you
We could buy a '62 Cadillac
Put a Fender amplifier in the back
Drive straight to the heart of America
Turn up to ten, let that sucker blast
Baby, way down deep, it's the same old you
Way down deep, you ain't hiding the truth
Just for a minute, you had me fooled
Baby, way down deep, it's the same old you
Same old you
