Finding Out LyricsThere's something wrong, I can't get my finger on it
I must be looking over something
Sometimes at night, I've had to fight with this emptiness
It's been so hard to see there's something more than this
I'm finding out, I'm finding out
Yeah it look a little time to get what love was about
But honey, I'm coming around
I'm finding out
I've had enough of all this hardcore loneliness
I don't think pain is so romantic
I'm just a working man, I feel each day go by
I couldn't understand I was too weak to fight
I'm finding out, I'm finding out
Yeah it look a little time for me to stand up and shout
But honey, I'm coming around
I'm finding out
I have to thank you, baby, honey I must confess
You have pulled me from this river of loneliness
Baby, I'm finding out
Yeah it look a little time to get what love was about
But honey, I'm coming around
I'm finding out
I'm finding outEmbed
