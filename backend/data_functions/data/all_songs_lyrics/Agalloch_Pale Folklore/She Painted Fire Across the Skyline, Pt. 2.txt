She Painted Fire Across the Skyline, Pt. 2 Lyrics
She is the dark one
As a bird I watched her from my cold tower
In the heavens and when she fell from the northplace
I flew down and embraced her

I took her where the snow falls forever
She showed me the haunted woods
We gathered together in the oaken palace
Free from both death and life
The fire blazed in her eyes one day
And she tore my soul from my chest
With a bleeding heart, I flew back to my cold tower
To never escape and lie in a pool of death foreverEmbed
