As Embers Dress the Sky Lyrics
The shallow voice of the wind
Cries between these ebony wings
The shallow cries of the wind
Sing a swansong for mankind

Shine on morning skyfire
Ablaze this final day
The autumnal end, the dawn of man
The centuries fade below my feet

I soared above them as they worthlessly
Poured thought from a chalice
As wisdom would flow, twilight would come to pass
Drink, oh hallowed cup of life


Shine on evening skyfire
Paint the sky with the blood of a raven
Bereavement, oh garment of ebony
As embers dress the dusk of manEmbed
