She Painted Fire Across the Skyline, Pt. 3 Lyrics
I saw the nightfall, it called to me like a river of shadows
It sang to me with the cries of a thousand ravens that blackened the sky
As they took flight and sank the Sol
I shall never trust the sun again, Eridanis Nadir

I ran away far into the woods
To find the Sol, I called to her
"I don't want to be forgotten
I never wanted to be human, never!"

So, alas, the sun had descended
Her fire burned brilliant in the sky
The trees bore their withered silhouettes
That cast a spell upon unearthly white
No wolf shall keep his secrets
No bird shall dance the skyline
And I am left with nothing
But an oath that gleams like a sword
To bathe in the blood of man
Bathe in the blood of man
Bathe in the blood of man
Bathe in the blood of mankind
She painted fire across the skyline1Embed
