The River Lyrics
Once you're in the zone
The river flows down like a full stone
Water is your bed
The ripples cushion your head

I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river
I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

Once you're where I led
It will be clear what I have said
Float without a home
The river flows like another long road

I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river
I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

Frozen over home
The fading light shines on the white stone
Melt your little zone
And sink into the waterfall flow

I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river
I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
