Lonely Steel Sheet Flyer Lyrics
Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn
Lover you will be stolen from us in the morn
Lover conceal me, all of my body, I won't go
Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn

Lover its all me wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Look in the sky see, inside a jet stream goodbye
Caught in a wind beam, out in the sky stream, mornin'
Lover it's all me, a lonely steel sheet flyer

My lonely wings are ready for flight
The ocean is breathing between you and I
My lonely wings don't make it right
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly

Lover believe me it won't be easy when I'm gone
Blinder I will be, dead and awake see, I'll mourn
Lover believe me, it's not the TV, it's more
Lover believe me, it won't be easy when I'm gone

Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired
My head is dusty, my nose is crusty, this flight
Lover I'm lonely, a lonely steel sheet flyer

Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired
My head is dusty, my nose is crusty, this flight
Lover I'm lonely, a lonely steel sheet flyer

My lonely wings are ready for flight
The ocean is breathing between you and I
My lonely wings don't make it right
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly2Embed
