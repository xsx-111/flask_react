Every Hungry Woman Lyrics
Yeah, sad eyed woman
Oh you boogie 'til dawn
Yeah long about the break of day, yeah
Oh your man has up and gone

You got 13 lovely children
No proud father knocking at your door, yeah
But every hungry woman
Has been in your place before

Yeah, the doctor keep calling
Woah found you'd fallen
Yeah you backed him in the corner
Oh you're doing what you wanna

You got 14 lovely children
No proud father knocking at your door
But every hungry woman
Has been in your place before

You got 15 lovely children
No proud father knocking at your door
But every hungry woman
Has been in your place before

Whoa, the doctor keep calling
Yeah, found you'd fallen
Whoa you backed him in the corner
Yeah, you're doing what you wanna

You got 16 lovely children
No proud father knocking at your door, yeah
But every hungry woman
Has been in your place before

Alright
Sad eyed woman
Ohhhh2Embed
