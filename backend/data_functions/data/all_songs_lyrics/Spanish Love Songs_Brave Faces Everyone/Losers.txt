Losers Lyrics
Well, we're gonna waste the days
Getting outpriced of our apartments
Hoping we don't go homeless
We sure as shit ain't moving home
Watching television we're stealing from our parents
So many opinions on how we live
But there's no option for even how to get out of bed

And my bleak mind says it's cheaper just to die
The prick inside my head's laid off and daring me to try
And my bleak mind says, "This is all you got"
Hoping all this time, but all you'll find is
It gets harder, doesn't it?
It gets harder, doesn't it?

I won't see the doctor 'til
I'm down on my knees
Blacking out in strip malls to avoid
Taking care of what's in front of me, so
I'll live my life off points
From credit card financing
You'll stay stuck losing your jobs
Let's watch these options pile up
Or let's ask for help
And my bleak mind says it's cheaper just to die
The prick inside my head's laid off and daring me to try
And my bleak mind says, "This is all you got"
Hoping all this time, but all you'll find is
It gets harder, doesn't it?
It gets harder, doesn't it?
It gets harder, doesn't it?
It gets harder, doesn't it?

And we replaced my broken mattress
With another hand-me-down
Talking nightly about nothing
Feels like giving up somehow
Haven't we faced enough
To know this is how it goes?
We're mediocre, we're losers forever
We're losers forever

And my bleak mind says it's cheaper just to die
The prick inside my head's laid off and daring me to try
And my bleak mind says it's cheaper just to die
The prick inside my head's laid off and daring me to try
And my bleak mind says, "This is all you got"
Hoping all this time, but all you'll find is
It gets harder, doesn't it?
It gets harder, doesn't it?
It gets harder, doesn't it?
It gets harder, doesn't it?Embed
