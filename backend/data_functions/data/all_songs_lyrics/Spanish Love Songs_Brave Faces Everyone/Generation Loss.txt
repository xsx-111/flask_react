Generation Loss Lyrics
You twenty-nine year panic attack
You're not the fashionable kind
The kind where you wake up and say
"Man, I just wanna survive"
But this world is short on empathy
You got out of your parents' place
Started making money
Crashed your car and now they want your laces

And they gave you just enough
To make you feel like you fucked up
When you realized you couldn't keep yourself clean
Well, kid, you're not half bad
Could even be more than your dad
So why're you complaining
If they're not listening?

'Cause we're just so fucking tired
Of explaining ourselves
We throw a pill down our throats
Or ourselves into the ocean
'Cause half our friends are dead
The other half are depressed
In this budget-rate life
The borderline's looking thin
Driving out into the water
'Cause you took that leap of faith
All I see is you floating
So I turned my stereo up
You're living bender to bender
I only saw you when we were high
You're finally touching down and I'm folding

She said, "Enough is not enough"
You always feel like you've fucked up
So what's the point of keeping yourself in line?
They won't name you in the papers
See you out past the breakers
Same smile you've had since you were five

'Cause we're just so fucking tired
Of explaining ourselves
We throw a pill down our throats
Or ourselves into the ocean
'Cause half our friends are dead
The other half are depressed
In this budget-rate life
The borderline's looking thin
I know that life is long enough
Didn't think you'd speed it up
Feel selfish that we still want you alive
The memorial wasn't bad
Some people tried to understand
Thought you were complaining
But we weren't listening

'Cause we're just so fucking tired
Of explaining ourselves
We throw a pill down our throats
Or ourselves into the ocean
'Cause half our friends are dead
The other half are depressed
In this budget-rate life
The borderline's looking thin

So we throw ourselves into the ocean1Embed
