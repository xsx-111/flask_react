Beach Front Property Lyrics
Said, "It's the end of days"
And we’re just hoping for the beach front property
Knowing indecision daring some asshole to take a swing
Got eight hundred dollars to my name
Not sure what it means
Trying to take these bastards for a quarter of a million
Despite your Mom’s protesting

If every city is the same
Doom and gloom under a different name
Maybe we should find our home in one

I hate the rhythm of our lives these days
Stare into a dead space, shouting at my phone
Ducking in my seat 'cause someone brought a bag into the movie theater
Everyone shrugs at the same time
Yeah, yeah, we know you’re sick and sad the 30 somethings in a bar
Play us some nostalgia songs
'Cause no one really wants to hear about you anymore, I know

If every city is the same
Doom and gloom under a different name
Maybe we should find our home in one
We argue and assign the blame
Not like any of us feel the shame
Count on one hand all the good we’ve done
Said, "It's the end of days"
And you’re still pissing in the wind
Don’t believe in God
Figure he’d be a better planner than this
I’m tired anyway
Why the Hell would I care?
I’m tired anyway

If every city is the same
Doom and gloom under a different name
Maybe we should find our home in one
We argue and assign the blame
Not like any of us feel the shame
Count on one hand all the good we’ve done

I'm tired anyway
Why the Hell would I care?
I'm tired anyway1Embed
