Self-Destruction (As a Sensible Career Choice) Lyrics
Well, all I hear is, "Patience"
All I have are missed bank payments
I can't keep my head above the nonsense
This ain't gonna make me famous
But I can't eat off this paycheck
My dreams are quick-drying cement
Slipping through the tips of my fingers
Fill my pockets
Cannonball into the black when I hear you say

"It won't be this bleak forever" (Yeah right)
"It won't be this bleak forever" (And I hope you're right)
"It won't be this bleak forever" (Have you seen me lately?)
"It won't be this bleak forever" (Yeah right)

It's like I'm falling deeper and deeper
Thinking someday I just need a miracle
Need about 30 goddamn miracles
Well you say, "Be your own god"
You say, "You're sane, so get yourself right
So we can start again"
I'm so preoccupied with my own life
I can't see the world is burning down
'Til we're living under water
"It won't be this bleak forever" (Yeah right)
"It won't be this bleak forever" (And I hope you're right)
"It won't be this bleak forever" (Have you seen me lately?)
"It won't be this bleak forever" (Yeah right)

And I'm stuck here pulling out threads
But this won't move in reverse
And I'll die here in the Midwest
Why can't I live with that?

"It won't be this bleak forever" (Yeah right)
"It won't be this bleak forever" (And I hope you're right)
"It won't be this bleak forever" (Have you seen me lately?)
"It won't be this bleak forever" (Yeah right)

It can't be this bleak forever
It can't be this bleak forever
It can't be this bleak forever
Have you seen me lately?
It can't be this bleak forever1Embed
