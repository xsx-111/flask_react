Losers 2 Lyrics
Staring like a stranger from the dirt field
Across from my, my childhood home
Noticed how out of place I looked there
It's a place I can't afford
When my family lost it back in '08
We swore it was just a setback
And all we needed was to graduate
Keep ignoring facts

Don't you know you were born to die poor, man?
Don't you know that you're gonna do yourself in?
And you'll always wake up tired
Because there's nowhere we go from here

Stuck working at that third job, driving
Well-meaning moms to protest for minimum wage
Still depressed, still living for the weekend
Still terrified to die at your age
No cancer, no crash, it better all go as planned
Or one day soon, you're not gonna get by
You know damn well there ain't a promised land
The cost of living means, it costs to stay alive
Well don't you know you were born to die poor, man?
Don't you know that you’re gonna do yourself in?
And you'll always wake up tired
Because there's nowhere we go from here
They'll say that these are our exciting days
At least until they ask our age
Now I'm just a walking tragic ending
Fuck, I don't wanna be the last one standing

So I'm leaving the city
Maybe the country
Maybe the Earth
Gotta find a place of my own
Where the fuckups aren't cops
Patrolling neighborhoods they're afraid of
And the rest of us won't burn out
Displacing locals from neighborhoods we're afraid of
Now if we weren't bailed out
Every time by our parents, we'd be dead
What's gonna happen when they're dead?

Well don't you know you were born to die poor, man?
Don't you know that you're gonna do yourself in?
And you'll always wake up tired
Because there's nowhere we go from here
They'll say that these are our exciting days
At least until they ask our age
Now I'm just a walking tragic ending
Fuck, I don't wanna be the last one standingEmbed
