Kick Lyrics
When you saw your dad shoot up for the first time
It must've came as quite a shock
You sat numb in your room for hours
Ignoring the afternoon's drop-offs
You picture him, arms outstretched in a song
After Sunday school let out
He'd drive the family home and you'd
Talk about Jesus

But fifteen years can change a man
Alone in this wilderness

Say "keep your head up" if you're not okay
But not okay is what's expected
They claim you're a hero if you can make it off the couch
You know the truth in what they say
The world's gonna kick you either way

But now you're stuck in this routine
Just trying to make something on your own
Your older brother fled the country
The cops are coming 'round your home
But Kaylee has a baby on the way
They're not gonna leave her a single mother
The dope was legal but they roughed you up
For selling on the side
Yeah, twenty years will change a man
Ten with behavior is what you're looking at

Just keep your head down and you'll be okay
You're living up to what's expected
They'll claim you're nothing when you're walking out the door
You know the truth in what they say
The world's gonna kick you either way

And Mom won't even come around most days
You pop your prescription and you put on a brave face
Zone out to the local AM station
And try not to think about next month's visitation

I saw you last week, we haven't talked since graduation
You're moving "H" with a guy to catch up, but it's clear you're using
I didn't have the guts to be a better friend
But what's another ten grand gonna fix in the end?

Say "keep your head up" if you're not okay
But not okay is what's expected
They claim you're a hero, but you died there on the couch
You know the truth in what they say
The world's gonna kick you either wayEmbed
