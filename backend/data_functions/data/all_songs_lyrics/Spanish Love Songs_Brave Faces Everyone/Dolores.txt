Dolores Lyrics
The radio's droning, dulled out by the
Intercom on fire
Guiding the evening's choreography
And Katie has her hand in a young man's chest
Stain on her white shoes that won't wash out
So usual, not the last pair this year

And down the hallway, cries rise and fall
In between the nearly constant sirens
Someone turns on the news like we need it
It's just another white man with a grudge
The break room sits empty
Just like our hearts been draining in the waiting room
Think of your daughter at her wedding
And you know life isn't long enough

Your shirt's speckled red, you're holding onto a
Young girl's hand, so frail and cold
So casual, not even the last one today
And I wish for the fingers to count or the
Memory to remember each new city
But I lost track so long ago
I think it was around "260"
Well, they're praying for you
You
For you

They're praying for you
They're praying for you
For you
For you
They're praying for you
They're praying for you
They're praying for you
I said, "They're praying for you"
Isn't that good enough?Embed
