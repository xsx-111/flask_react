Optimism (As a Radical Life Choice) Lyrics
The pain is back in my chest again
Holding me down like a high school friend says
"The worlds about to end, you best start swimming"
You said, "Anxiety is the theme of all our lives these days"
Can't even have my coffee without exploiting someone
Or making another millionaire, or billionaire
What would it take to be happy?
I’ll probably start with the money

It's the clear backpacks, it's the two new fire exits
I’m buying a beer
Don't want to think of where I'm running
If another asshole takes a shot
It's the city burning down
While I stared at dirty pics you sent me
And I'm hiding in the desert
But I taste the ocean in my snot
Trying to find my footing
I know you're sick of walking

Don't take me out back and shoot me
I know my circuits are faulty
Now I've only ever been a kid
Pointing out dead dogs on the road
Take me down in the landslide
Help me weather this high tide
I’ll wear you out waiting for me to implode
But don’t take me out back and shoot me
But I'm done dying on the inside
Now that everything is dying outside
The sky is letting go
Of holding on like a crying child
Armageddon on my mind
I’ll try to smile all the time
Like Hell's a construct that I need
To make amends or keep myself clean
And yes, I'm aware it's fleeting

Don’t take me out back and shoot me
I know my circuits are faulty
Now I've only ever been a kid
Pointing out dead dogs on the road
Take me down in the landslide
Help me weather this high tide
I'll wear you out waiting for me to implode

Because the ocean's gonna rise
The river's finally gonna overflow
And leave us stranded
Trying to make it to the other side
But there's a crack in my lifeboat
And now I'm sinking
Well, I'm sinking, would you sink with me?
We're sinking
Take me out back and shoot me
Know my circuits are faulty
I've only ever been a kid
Pointing out dead dogs on the road
Take me down in the landslide
Weather this high tide
I'll wear you out waiting for me to implode
Don't take me out back and shoot me
I know my circuits are faulty
And that I've only ever been a kid
Pointing out dead dogs on the road
Take me down in a landslide
Can we weather this high tide?
Well, I'll wear you out watching the world implode
But don't take me out back and shoot meEmbed
