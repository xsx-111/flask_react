Brave Faces, Everyone Lyrics
Broken nose, another textured ceiling
I know where I am, I'll pretend like I'm lost
Sometimes I want to vanish completely
And call in sick from life
I woke up and didn't feel better
Don't know why I act surprised
At least each year is getting shorter
And the ocean's on the rise
'Cause I'm terrified there's no more waiting
I'm running out of what comes next
Running through jobs I'm gonna hate
Living paycheck to paycheck
Like my parents, and their parents
And their parents before them
I should be happy I have no personal effects
But I've got my encore
I'm back living on their floor

But I feel like burning down my life again
I watch the fire spread over my skin
Until I'm nothing left but skeleton

I saw a sign in Hanover
That said, "The future is in motion"
But the motion has me sick
It's okay, I'm sick of standing
I'm still paying off a good idea
From when I was twenty-three
A life spent living off loans
When I still don't know
What I love, I'm over-leveraged
My credit's gone weak
The city turned off the power
You know, it's dark most of the week
But if I burn this place down
We'd have some heat
At least I'm seeing things more positively
Because I swear to God, I'm an optimist
But I feel like burning down my life again
I watch the fire spread over my skin
Until I'm nothing left but skeleton
A pile of dust that's free, just floating in the wind
But brave faces, everyone
I'm always looking up and you're jumping
But brave faces, everyone

But this world, it has no empathy
We'll never find our own place
And if nothing gets better
It's as bad as it seems
Why can't we say, "Fuck it"?
You know it's not what we need

('Cause we're just so fucking tired)
(If you're not okay)
(I'm feeling lower than anyone)
(They're praying for you)
(I'm tired anyway)
(Or weather this high tide)
(And what is all your heartache worth?)
Brave faces, everyone
(Just let me ruin my guts tonight)
(Yeah right, it can't be this bleak forever)
(Pointing out dead dogs on the road)
(I'm tired anyway)
(This is all you'll get)
(Hoping all this time but all you find is)
(Be the last one standing)
I'm sick of yelling at strangers
Don't want to do this forever
And when it all burns down
Will you carry me over?
We don't have to fix everything at once
We were never broken, life's just very long
Brave faces, everyoneEmbed
