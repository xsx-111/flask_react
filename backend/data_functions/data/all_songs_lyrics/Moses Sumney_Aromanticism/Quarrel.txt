Quarrel Lyrics
He who asks for much has much to give
I don't ask for much, just enough to live
But in the light, morning will reveal the spoils of night
Through the walls of Jericho lies a heart of stone
With you, half the battle is proving that we're at war
I would give my life just for the privilege to ignore

Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel
Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel

To whom much is given, much is required
Luxurious liver, you never inquire
It ain't right, you see, who is your family?
If I don't have tools to fight, calling this a quarrel isn't right
Quoting this a quarrel so immorally implies
We're equal opponents and we both antagonize

Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel
Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel

Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel
Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel
We cannot be lovers
'Cause I am the other
We cannot be lovers
Long as I'm the other
