Untitled LyricsWaiting in the car
I shed out tears
Right by on the car
I stay up on weekdays for you
Of course I poise it
Of course I did
Of course I have no voice in it
Of course I did
Too young too dumb to turn me low
These bends have fallen to stay on course
Can I hit your end?
Did I demoralize?
Of course I poise it
Of course I did
Of course I have no voice in it
Of course I have no voice in it
Of course I did
