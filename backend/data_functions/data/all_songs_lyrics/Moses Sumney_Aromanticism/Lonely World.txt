Lonely World Lyrics
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely world
Casts a shadow on the shallow love it hurls
To the feet of swine it need not cast its pearls
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely world

And the sound of the void
Flows through your body undestroyed
And the sound of your voice
Flows from your body, white as noise

And the void speaks to you
In ways nobody speaks to you
And that voice fills the air
Fog in the morning going nowhere

Lonely, lonely, lonely face under a veil
After all the laughter, emptiness prevails
Born into this world with no consent or choice
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely...3Embed
