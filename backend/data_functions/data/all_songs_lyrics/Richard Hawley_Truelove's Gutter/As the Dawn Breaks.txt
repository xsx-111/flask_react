As the Dawn Breaks LyricsAs the dawn breaks
Over roof slates
Hope hung on every washing line
As your heart aches
Over life's fate
I know we never had much time
For us to give
But we did
There's something in those deep blue eyes
As the light creeps over the houses
And the slates are darked by rain
In this morning search for meaning
I hear a songbird's melody
I hear a songbird's melody
And she's singing just for me
As the light creeps over the houses
And the slates are darked by rain
In this morning search for meaning
I hear a songbird's melody
I hear a songbird's melody
And she's singing just for me
Oh, she's singing just for me
A simple songbird's melody1Embed
