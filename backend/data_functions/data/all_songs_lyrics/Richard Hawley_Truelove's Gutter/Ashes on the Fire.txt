Ashes on the Fire LyricsI wrote you a letter
Late last night
The words on the paper
My true heart's desire
Now in this bright morning
Oh, what did I find?
No sign of the letter
Ashes on the fire
This morning brought sorrow
This morning brought tears
They bloomed like a flower
From deep-seated fears
My words like an arrow
Aimed so much higher
My bow broke asunder
Ashes on the fire
I know that you weary
Of this life we've made
In silence I sit here
And read the flames
Come sit down beside me
You ghosts of the pyre
And nightly remind me
Ashes on the fire
Ashes on the fire
Ashes on the fireEmbed
