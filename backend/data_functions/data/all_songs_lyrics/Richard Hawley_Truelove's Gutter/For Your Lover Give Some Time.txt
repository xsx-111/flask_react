For Your Lover Give Some Time LyricsIt was your birthday yesterday
I gave a gift that almost took your breath away
But to be honest, I nearly left it on the train
For your lover give some time
You talk forever on the phone
To your mother and with my thoughts I'm left alone
Now and then I think how strange our love has grown
For your lover give some time
I will give up these cigarettes
Stay at home and watch you mend a tear in your dress
Have your name in a rose tattooed across my chest
And be your lover for all time
Maybe I will drink a little less
Come home early and not complain about the day
And give you flowers from the graveyard now and then
For your lover give some time
I think of places that I've seen
A skipping stone across the ocean I have been
A rootless man with no one else to share my dreams
And for my lover gave no time
Here's a toast to you, Helene
To all the cinemas we ran in from the rain
Laughing, clutching soaking newspapers to your face
And for your love you gave some time
I will give up these cigarettes
Stay at home and watch you mend the tears in your dress
Have your name in a rose tattooed across my chest
And be your lover for all time
Maybe I will drink a little less
Come home early and not complain about the day
And give you flowers from the graveyard now and then
And for my lover give some time
For your lover give some timeEmbed
