Soldier On LyricsNever say goodbye
You're the apple of my eye
The bells I hear them ring
And in the churchyard children sing
For so long
For so long
I've soldiered on
For so long
Another blessed morning comes
Thy will on earth be done
Blundered into the abyss
To seek the wonders of your kiss
I still can taste your lips
My hands upon your hips
For so long
For so long
I've soldiered on
For so long
As the stars they slowly die
Thunder cracks across the sky
These are the words I've longed to say:
Be with me, my love, always
But no our moonlit silhouettes they part and fade
I'm left with a loneliness that has no name
For so long
For so long
I'll soldier on
For so long
Never say goodbye
You're the apple of my eyeEmbed
