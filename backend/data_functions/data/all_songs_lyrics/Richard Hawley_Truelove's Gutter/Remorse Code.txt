Remorse Code LyricsYou're caught
In the net
Fathoms deep
In regret
Remorse code
The message sent
Count the cost
Of a force spent
In those white lines
Made your eyes wide
Unenlightened lies
In those white lines
The ship is wrecked
With all hands
Look to the reef
False lights from the land
Way off course
The fool's sail is set
Lashed to the wheel
To pay the stars their debt
With those white lines
Made your eyes wide
Unenlightened lies
In those white lines
The clipper calls
Her siren dares
And she gives you
A hand lock of hair
Laid to waste
Drowned alone
Burned out
A seashell of a soul
With those white lines
Made your eyes wide
Unenlightened lies
In those white lines
Oh, those white lines
Oh, those white lines
Oh, those white lines
Made your eyes wide
Unenlightened lies
In those white lines
I was likewise
In those white lines
Oh, those white linesEmbed
