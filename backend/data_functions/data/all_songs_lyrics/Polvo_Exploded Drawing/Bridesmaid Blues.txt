Bridesmaid Blues LyricsAnd you want to know
Be the first to avoid the curse
Live life in reverse
Cash a check like a nervous wreck
Too perplexed to break the hex
And you want to know
I speak the future in a crystal ball
High hands waving to the tip of your tongue
The stupid phrases of a of a rural charm
Hop the bus and leave the farm
Stars aligned, bursting high, such a bridesmaid
Stars aligned, bursting high, such a bridesmaid
Stars aligned, bursting high, such a bridesmaid
Stars aligned, bursting high, such a bridesmaidEmbed
