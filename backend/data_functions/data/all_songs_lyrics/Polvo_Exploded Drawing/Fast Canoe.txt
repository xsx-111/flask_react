Fast Canoe LyricsIf you're on a journey cause you had to work things out
Take your time to get it right
And I hope you erase all your doubt
If you had a notion
You're gonna sail across the ocean
In a boat built for one
Keep dry and stay near the sun
One thing I remember is
You never did a bad thing to me
I'll build a boat for two and I'll row it for you
I'm waiting for a postcard that you won't write
Just hoping there's a chance that you might
I'm clinging to a memory that we might share
Just trying to send a thought through the air
If you have a message
You want me to pass it along
Find a way to get it through
And I promise I'll whisper for you
But if you're undercover
You'd better leave your briefcase behind
You won't need a lock or a key to keep what you find
If you get in trouble and you need to make your escape
I'll carve a fast canoe and I'll send it to you
I'm waiting for a postcard that you won't write
Just hoping there's a chance that you might
I'm clinging to a memory that we might share
Just trying to send a thought through the air
I'm looking for a metaphor that you might like
But I can't find the one that you deserve to hear2Embed
