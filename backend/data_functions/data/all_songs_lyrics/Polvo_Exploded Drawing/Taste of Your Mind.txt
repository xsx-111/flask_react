Taste of Your Mind LyricsOnce upon a time we used to count stars on a clear night
The street lights have made it hard to see
You say there's magic in the drowned out constellations
Won't you make it magical for me
When we're drifiting through the chaos of the city
You're only looking straight ahead
I wanna stop to take a picture of the skyline
You would rather burn it down instead

Can i hold the weight of your mind
Can i have a taste of your mind
Can i climb the hill of you mind
Can i learn the ways of your mind
Can i buy the weight of your mind
Can i try a piece of your mind
Can i see the whole of your mind
Can i see the hole in your mind
I try to understand that blankness is a blessing
Even though it doesn't seem to be
You watch the passion with the wonder of a stranger
Won't you make it wonderful for me
When we're passing through equations of disaster
I subtract myself from what I see
You say there's beauty in the nature of the nightmare
Can't you make it beautiful for me
