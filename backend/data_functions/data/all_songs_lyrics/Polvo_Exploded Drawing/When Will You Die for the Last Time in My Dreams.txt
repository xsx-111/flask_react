When Will You Die for the Last Time in My Dreams LyricsShow me how it's done
You're a salesman's son
Go down to the end of your street and melt into the star-spangled night
Catch a first class flight
They'll take you to the edge of the world
It's flatter than the maps that they've drawn
When they own the law
They'll trust you to the young like they wish they were
Cause they've been there
They know you
They like your kind
They'll teach you who you are and they'll sell you to yourself
Somewhere south of your neighborhood
There's a chemical flavor
Not so far from your hotel
The scenery is bringing you down
Somewhere south of your border
Can you follow the order
Like an ancient explorer
They recognized your eyes and you still don't know why
When you see me wave
Don't wave back
I might not feel the need to explain what I mean
It's a dangerous dance
But if I had the chance
I'd get you at the edge of the world
It's stranger than the stories you choose
For the evening news
I never hear your name cause you write it all yourself
At the edge of the world
It's a job done well
They'll shoot you for a look inside your shiny plastic shell
Somewhere south of your neighborhood
There's a chemical flavor
Not so far from your hotel
The radio is casting a spell
Somewhere south of your border
Can you follow the order
Like an ancient explorer
They recognized your eyes and you still don't know why
When will you die for the last time in my dreams?Embed
