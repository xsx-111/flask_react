Snowstorm in Iowa LyricsNow get me around the bend
Just to meet, haven't got no friend
Number ten, he test the strength
Now he needs his forgotten faith
He's coming now
He's coming now
Mary she had it all
Now she sees it's starting to fall
With Jesus by her side
And ask for the kid or a ride
He's coming now
He's coming nowEmbed
