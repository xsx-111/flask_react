High-Wire Moves LyricsRegister shadows like an embassy intern
Never forget the way the cold floor burns
Working for customs in the corporal bonfire
Never forget the way the acrobat learns
There was a time I thought you would
It was a fantasy that wasn't meant to be
There was a time I thought you could
Become the enemy
Bring me back again from a diplomat
Tell me what it is and I will change it back
I know you're not a diplomat
You're just an acrobat practicing high-wire moves
Practicing high-wire moves
I'll be the jumble of all you control
Don't stop until the chalk's all gone
If I believe your inventions are halfway true
Will you relate when I'm struggling too
But why should I care when you think that the voice I chase
Is nothing special in the first place
Picture a barb-wire bridge and approach if you dare

Never forget the way that floor burns
Working for customs in the bonfire
Never forget the way the acrobat learns)
Register shadows like an embassy intern
Never forget the way the coal floor burns
Working for customs in the corporal bonfire
Never forget the way the acrobat learns
There was a time I thought you would
It was a fantasy that wasn't meant to be
There was a time I thought you could
Become the enemy
Bring me back again from a diplomat
Tell me what it is and i will change it back
I know you're not a diplomat
You're just an acrobat practicing high-wire moves
Practicing high-wire moves
I'll be the jumble of all you control
Don't stop until the chalk's all gone
But why should I care when you think that the voice I chase
Is nothing special in the first place
Picture a barb-wire bridge in approach if you dare
I'll meet you halfway there
Just 'cause I'm halfway thereEmbed
