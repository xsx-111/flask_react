In This Life LyricsAll I want to do is just assess the situation
Cultivate alliances, inspect the situation
In this life, it's for the strong
In this life you can't tell me I'm wrong
Thanks for the telephone, it keeps me in the know
Here's to the politics that make me want to go
In this life you can go insane
In this life you can stay the same
Don't be ashamed to paint a picture of yourself
You don't need to make it look like anybody else
In this life, well you might fall down
In this life you gotta get off the ground
And all you need to do is just assess the situation
Cultivate alliances, explain the situation
And this life was made you
You always seem to know exactly what to doEmbed
