Crumbling Down LyricsWhere did you get that burned out look?
Why did you sell all your
Favorite books
Everybody's got a question for you
Everybody wants to know if it's true
Everybody's saying that you stole it from them
Everybody's saying that you'll do it again
Everybody's saying that you're falling apart
I don't want to see you lost
I don't want to watch you lose your way
I don't want to have to say you seem ok
I don't want to make that choice
Pretending that I just don't hear your voice
Everytime I see you somewhere in this town
But everybody's saying that you're crumbling down
Where are you going with that nice tv
What happened to the one that you borrowed from me
Everybody's been looking for you
Everybody wants to know if it's true
Everybody's saying that you stole it from them
Everybody's saying that you'll do it again
Everybody's saying that you're falling apart
I don't want to see you lost
I don't want to watch you lose your way
I don't want to have to say you seem ok
I don't want to make that choice
Pretending that I just don't hear your voice
Everytime I see you somewhere in this town
But everybody's saying that you're crumbling down1Embed
