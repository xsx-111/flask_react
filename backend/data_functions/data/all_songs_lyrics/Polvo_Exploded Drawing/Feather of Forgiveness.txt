Feather of Forgiveness LyricsWhen you asked me what was on my mind
And said that you could keep it to yourself
You lied
Cause I've got the feeling you can't
I told you things I should have kept inside
And I know it's my fault cause I opened up the vault
But I will never think of you the same
I want to cover you with flowers of forgiveness
I want to touch you with the feather of forgiveness
I want to put you in a light that will hurt your eyes
I want to cover you with flowers of forgiveness
When you asked me what was on my mind
Well I thought that I was talking to a friend of mine
But I get the feeling that you're not
Something strange is gonna come your way
And I don't want to sound like a paranoid clown
But I will never think of you the same
I want to cover you with flowers of forgiveness
I want to touch you with the feather of forgiveness
I want to wash you in a river of forgiveness
I want to wrap you in the fabric of forgiveness
I want to put you in a light that will hurt your eyes (x3)
I want to cover you with flowers of forgivenessEmbed
