The Purple Bear LyricsEnter the fool
Swimming in a child proof pool
The cameraman says that you're looking so cool
We had to rent a school bus stuffed with sand
It's only gonna cost you a hundred grand
Your friends are in the background
And they're dancing well
And everybody hopes that the concept will sell
When i give the signal start eating dirt
Sing into a shovel
And take off your shirt
Let's go shopping in a posh boutique
Wear out more clothes then you wear in a week
But they can't see your face if you're looking down
And it's gonna look bad if they've been jumping around
Run slowly down the road
Think of a war starting when the fireworks explode
Walk into the church, start to confess
Now turn and face the priest
He's wearing a dress
Your friends are in the background
And they're dancing great
We have to wrap it up now
It's getting kinda late
So this is where you wrestle with the purple bear
And your gonna have to try not to mess up your hair
I'm so excited i could just explode
Cross your fingers and it might get shown
I told my parents to stay up late
But it's half past two
And there's been a mistake
I'm so excited i could just explode
Cross your fingers and it might get shown
I told my parents to stay up late
But it's half past two
And there's been a mistake1Embed
