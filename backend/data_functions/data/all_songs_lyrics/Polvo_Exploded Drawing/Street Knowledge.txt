Street Knowledge LyricsHow do I know that destiny is slow
I used to be a worker bee but now I'm a drone
Sun is bright and reflections a seat
We hear voices carried on a fertile breeze
In one ear and out the other
The voices they trail like a carpet's tail
Fly through the night with you on my rug
Like a bad location, kneel me and jump
You left for the city in the summer time
You know the streets were alive
With something to hide
They don't know how cool they know that song is forever on the radio
