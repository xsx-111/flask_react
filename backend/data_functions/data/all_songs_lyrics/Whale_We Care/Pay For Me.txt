Pay For Me LyricsPlease pick up speed (please, oh, speed it up)
When you forgive (forgive) them believe me (believe me)
I'm too pretty to shock (to shock)
So, for God's sake (Jesus)
Please feed me (daddy daddy daddy)
Driving you, daddy (ooo daddy daddy daddy)
You walk me (talk me) here alone (lalala)
Two of a club (you hit me too far)
(Swing) on the fairway to Hell (lalala-lalalala)
Loveliest girl right here will scream
Cuz you're my Santa Claus machine
Love me
Sugar daddy, pumpkin pie
Big colina, buy buy
Pay for me
Pull out my chair (siddown)
And light my (lalalala) unlit fire (a cigarette)
Go ahead, sucker (suffer)
Dress the way my (m-m-m-m-my) my handbag (itsam)
Providing love (love) for total affection ('fection)
24-hour (hour) item protection (yeah)
Lovely girl right here will scream
Cuz you're my Santa Claus machine
You need me
Sugar daddy, pumpkin pie
Big colina, buy buy
Pay for me
I'm so fragile at dawn (I yawn)
Radical and shaken (earthquake) and mixed (surf that)
When gravity kicks my ass
You better pay (cash money money)
For my tits to be fixed (tricks to fix your tits)
Lovely girl right here will scream
Cuz you're my Santa Claus machine
You love me
Sugar daddy, pumpkin pie
Big colina, buy buy
Pay for me
You leave me
Lovely girl right here will scream
Cuz you're my Santa Claus machine
You loved me
Sugar daddy, pumpkin pie
Big colina, bought bought
Paid for me
