Eurodog LyricsRich brat backpack client√®le
Furl a stale nine inch nail injure rail
White boy pick-pock paper trail
Fifty's easy-read: undead
Skinhead wrench-boy let you feel
His 2-foot/3-pound glockenspiel
So you're a dog, you'll try a phrase
Smear my braces in mayonnaise
Go, you Eurodog, go!
Go, you Eurodog, go! Go!
Go, you Eurodog, go!
Go, you Eurodog!
Go! Go! Go!
Prozac *coughcough* Prozac bliss
Is there a cure for being Swiss?
I can't help that I wanna fumble
Sarah Cracknell up her Chunnel tunnel
Stonewashed denim, ponytail
Polish guys, they dress to fail
Trash-white riots, 18 karats
Full-on becomes autopilot
Go, you Eurodog, go!
Go, you Eurodog, go! Go!
Go, you Eurodog, go!
Go, you Eurodog!
Go! Go!
Go, you Eurodog, go!
Go, you Eurodog, go! Go!
Go, you Eurodog, go!
Go, you Eurodog!
Go! Go! Go!Embed
