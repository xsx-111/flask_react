Happy In You LyricsOnce I met a boy
He told me that he planned for us
To spend some time
Once I met a boy
That told me that he knew that
Together we'd be alright
His brother said
"You don't know what you're doing
He's all over you"
I didn't think
That anyone could be like that
I was so happy in you, happy in you
(Py-py, py-py in you)
We talked on the phone
And got to know each other
Pretty well, I would say
We were in no hurry
We didn't go to bed
And I thought love had come our way
His brother said
"You don't know what you're doing
He just likes to be cruel"
I didn't think
That anyone could be like that
I was so happy in you, happy in you
(Py-py, py-py in you)
Then one night
When I was out drinking
Suddenly he was there
Something was wrong
I knew it, I could feel it
And I didn't know what to say
His brother said
"You don't know what you're doing"
I said, "What's on your mind?"
I looked into his eyes
And I found what I'd been missing
Well, love makes you blind
Happy in you
(Py-py, py-py in you)Embed
