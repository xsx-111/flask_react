Libation for Mr. Brown: Bid Em In... LyricsBid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in, yes
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Sun is hot and plenty bright
We gonna get down to business and get home tonight
Auctioning slaves is a real high art
Bring that young gal Roy, she’s good for a start
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Now here’s a really good buy only about fifteen
Her great-grandmammy was a Dahomey queen
Just to look at her face it sure ain’t homely
Like Sheba in the Bible, she’s black but comely
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
We’re gonna start at three, can I hear three?
Step up boys take a good look, see
Cause I know you want her once you've seen her
She’s young and rich, make a damn good breeder
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in, yes
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
She’s good in the fields, she can sew, she can cook
Strip her down Roy, let the gentlemen look
She’s full up front and ample behind
Examine her teeth if you got a mind
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in, yes
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Three-fifty is the bid I’m looking for four
If four hundred dollars, she’s a bargain show
Four is the bid, four fifty-five
Five hundred dollars, now look alive
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Don’t you mind them tears, that’s one of her tricks
Five fifty’s a bid, now who’ll say six?
She’s healthy, she’s strong, she’s well equipped
She makes a fine lady’s maid when she’s properly whipped
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Six is the bid, six twenty-five, six fifty, don’t be slow
Seven is the bid, seven twenty-five seven and a half gon’ let her go
At seven she’s gone, she’s gone, she’s gone
Drag her down Roy, chain her down Roy
Drag her down Roy, chain her down Roy
Drag her down Roy and bring the next one on
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in, yes
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in, come on
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
Bid 'em in, get ‘em in, bid ‘em in
