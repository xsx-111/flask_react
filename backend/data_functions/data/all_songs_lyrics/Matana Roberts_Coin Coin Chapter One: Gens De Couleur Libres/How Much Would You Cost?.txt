How Much Would You Cost? LyricsI wrote these words for my mother
I wrote this whole piece for my mother
But these words I wrote for her
I know how precious our lives can be
Dedicate this moment to you and me
Let's dance a Calinda, celebrate life
Reach for the sky, keep up your fight
How much would you cost?
How much would you cost?
I know how precious our lives can be
Dedicate this moment to you and me
Let's dance, celebrate life - it's short
Reach for the sky, keep up your fight
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
I know how precious our lives can be
Dedicate this moment to you and me
Let's dance, celebrate life
Reach for the sky, keep up your fight
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
I know how precious our lives can be
Dedicate this moment to you and me
Let's dance a Calinda, celebrate life
Reach for the sky, keep up your fight
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum-ba-dum
Dancing a Calinda-ba-dum
Thank you, very muchEmbed
