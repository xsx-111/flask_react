Kersaia Lyrics
I see,  the way he looks at me, and I wonder what does he have planned

Should I look back Or should I look away?
Do I have a choice or is inevitable?
The laws of the land say that I must submit
Yet the laws of my body confuse me
I am  a woman, bought and sold to bear the fruit of a seed that I do not wish to
Plant, but perhaps there's a way for me to survive, to strive, to , maybe even be me, to be free, me to be, me to be free, me to be me
How would I rectify in my soul, once I meet my maker?
Black man, red man, brown man, white man
Where is my savior? Where is he or where is she? Perhaps it is me
I have seen so much, but yet have experienced less than most dogs
I am smart, I am strong, I know how to survive, with the sophistication only known to the cunningness of beings
I am the beginning of the female hustling spirit
Hustling to survive so that others may strive to be something more than me
Hustling to  survive so that others may strive to be something more than me
Hustling to  survive so that others may strive to be something more than me
I am...
...Coin, coin
I am...
...Coin, coin
I am twenty five
There will never be any pictures of me

Jones, Jones, Jones, Jones, Jones...Embed
