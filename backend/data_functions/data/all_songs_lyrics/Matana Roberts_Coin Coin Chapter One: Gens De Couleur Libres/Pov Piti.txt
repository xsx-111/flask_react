Pov Piti Lyrics
I was born a child of the moon, in the year of 1742, the second daughter...

...Coin coin
My master was ruler of the land, governor, he was a  where I was born,  in the catholic church
The father, the son, and the hooooooly ghost
I watched my parents die of yellow fever
I cut open the womb of my dead mother to return the body still within of my brother, but yet I could not save him
Niggas are for working and not saving, niggas are for working and not saving
These tools of the earth, and the bush, and the moon
I am... coin coin
These tools of the earth, and the moon, and the bush
I was only sixteen, I was only sixteen
There will never be any pictures of me
Balthazar, Balthazar, Balthazar, Balthazar...Embed
