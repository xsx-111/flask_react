Turkish Song of the Damned LyricsI come, old friend, from Hell tonight, across the rotting sea
Nor the nails of the cross, nor the blood of Christ can bring you hope this eve
The dead have come to claim a debt from thee
They stand outside your door fourscore and three
Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind?
Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand?
Wailing away on the wall on the strand
As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned
You remember when the ship went down, you left me on the deck
The captain's corpse jumped up and threw his arms around my neck
For all these years I've had him on my back
This debt cannot be paid with all your jack
Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind?
Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand?
Wailing away on the wall on the strand
As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned
Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind?
Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand?
Wailing away on the wall on the strand
As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned
As I sit and talk to you, I see your face go white
This shadow hanging over me is no trick of the light
The specter on my back will soon be free
The dead have come to claim a debt from me
Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind?
Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand?
Wailing away on the wall on the strand
As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned
Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind?
Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand?
Wailing away on the wall on the strand
As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned
Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind?
Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand?
Wailing away on the wall on the strand
As you danced to the Turkish song of the damnedEmbed
