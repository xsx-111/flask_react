Turn Blue Lyrics
In the dead of the night I start to lose control
But I still carry the weight like I've always done before
It gets so heavy at times but what more can I do?
I got to stay on track just like Pops told me to

I really don't think you know
There could be Hell below...below
I really do hope you know
There could be Hell below...below

When the music is done and all the lights are low
I will remember the times when love would really glow
Like a dream I had before my world turned blue
When the light inside would only shine for you

I really don't think you know
There could be Hell below...below
I really do hope you know
There could be Hell below...below

I really don't think you know
There could be Hell below...below
I really do hope you know
There could be Hell below...below21Embed
