Little Child Lyrics
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

If you want someone
To make you feel so fine
Then we'll have some fun
When you're mine, all mine
So come, come on, come on

Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

When you're by my side
You're the only one
Don't you run and hide
Just come on, come on
Yeah come on, come on, come on

Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me (Oh yeah)
Baby take a chance with me (Oh yeah)
Baby take a chance with me (Oh yeah)Embed
