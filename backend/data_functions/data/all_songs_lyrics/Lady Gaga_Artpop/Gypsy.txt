Gypsy Lyrics
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So, I said...

I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (If you go with me)
For life (See the world with me)
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian, かんぱい !
Africa, India, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
I'm Latin-American
I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gypsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
Hey (Hey, hey, hey)31Embed
