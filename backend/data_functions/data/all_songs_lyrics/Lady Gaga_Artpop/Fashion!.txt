Fashion! Lyrics
(Fashion)
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine (Slay, slay)
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine (Fashion)

Step into the room like it's a catwalk (Fashion)
Singing to the tune, just to keep them talking (Fashion)
Walk into the light, displayin' diamonds and pearls in my (Fashion)
Married to the night
I own the world, we own the world

Look at me now, I feel on top of the world in my (Fashion)
Look at me now, I feel on top of the world in my (Fashion)
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine (Slay, slay)
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine (Slay, slay)
You've got company, make sure you look your best (Fashion)
Makeup on your face, a new designer dress (Fashion)
There's a life on Mars where the couture is beyond, beyond (Fashion)
Married to the stars
I own the world, we own the world

Look at me now, I feel on top of the world in my (Fashion)
Look at me now, I feel on top of the world in my (Fashion)
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine (Slay, slay)
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine (Slay)
(Slay, slay, slay, slay)

I take it off, I put it on
I feel alive when I transform
But this love's not material
Now take it in and turn me on
Zip me up, it can't be wrong
'Cause your new look's ethereal
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine (Slay, slay)
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Looking good and feeling fine
Fashion, je me sens au paradis en
Fashion, donnez-moi Christian Louboutins, fashion
Le monde est à moi, c'est la vie en fashion
Je suis en haute couture en fashion
Fashion, fashion, f-fashion
Fashion, fashion
Fashion, fashion28Embed
