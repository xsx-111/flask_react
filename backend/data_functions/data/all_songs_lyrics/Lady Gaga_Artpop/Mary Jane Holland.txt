Mary Jane Holland Lyrics
Lady of the Dam
Won't be a slave to the blonde, or the culture of the popular
(She won't, she won't)
Sing at you, I'll fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil inside
(I will, I will)

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Woo-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Oh-hoo!)
I don't like to boast
But our truffles are the most
Mad-magical in Amsterdam
(She won't, she won't)
So if you have fear, Apollo
Sit on my lyre, and play him like a piano, man
(I will, I will)

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Woo-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Oh-hoo!)
I know that Mom and Dad think I'm a mess
But it's alright, because I am rich as piss
When I ignite the flame and put you in my mouth
The grass eats up my insides, and my brunette starts to sprout
Introducing, ladies and gentleman, Mary Jane Holland!

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Woo-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Oh-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Woo-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Oh-hoo!)30Embed
