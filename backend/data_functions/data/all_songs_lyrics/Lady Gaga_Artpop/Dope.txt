Dope Lyrics
Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins

Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'll hate myself until I die

My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
Toast, one last puff and two last regrets
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
Up Heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of his soul

Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than dope36Embed
