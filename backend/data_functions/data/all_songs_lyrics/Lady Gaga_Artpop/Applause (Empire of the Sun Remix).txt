Applause (Empire of the Sun Remix) Lyrics
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV
Baby, could I bear being away from you
I found the vein, put it in here

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause (I know what you're waiting for)

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)

A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

I've overheard your theory "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now artâ€™s in pop culture, in me
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
(When the lights are meant to die
I know it's worth waiting for
When the lights are meant to die
I know it's worth waiting for

Touch, touch

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, make 'em touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-R-T-P-O-P
Put your hands up, make it real loud
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

A-R-T-P-O-PEmbed
