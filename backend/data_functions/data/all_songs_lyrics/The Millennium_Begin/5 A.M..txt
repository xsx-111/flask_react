5 A.M. LyricsFive o'clock in the morning
Life doesn't seem to be the same
It's beautiful, beautiful
So remember, remember
The dew drops are dampening
Sidewalks that we stroll along
The streets are bare
There's nobody there
In the misty dawn that surrounds the town
The world is speechless in the morning
And I can watch the sun wake up the day
Five o'clock in the morning
Funny how much it means to me
It's all so still, it gives me chills
Just standing there in the pure morning air
Five o'clock in the morning
Five o'clock in the morning1Embed
