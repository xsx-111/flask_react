I Just Want To Be Your Friend LyricsYou know I just want to be your friend
Cause I'd like our little drama
To have a happy ending
And finally be fear transcending
You know I'd just like to send you
A love light or maybe two
'Cause I know you're thinking 'bout me
And to when we were so free
If you only know there's a someone who really loves you
It's your heart and it's your soul
And it's you they want to know
You've got to love yourself before you love another
You know I just want to be your friend
Cause I'd like our little drama
To have a happy ending
And finally be fear transcending
Look into your eyes and say
"You I dare face me today
And if I play love's game to win
Can I give up this bag I'm in?"
You know I just want to be your friend
You know I'd just like to be your friend
You know I just want to be your friend
You know I'd just like to be your friendEmbed
