It Wont Always Be The Same Lyrics
I know where the next rain's gonna fall
I know where the next sun's gonna shine
And it's all clear to me
I can tell from what I see
And I know that it won't always be the same

You know every step you walk away
You think all your world will never end
But you're hardly ever right
When you're standing in the light
And again you find you can't recite your name

There's a change coming soon, can you see it?
There's a change coming soon, can you see it?

I can hear the sounds of coming winds
You can only hear your anger sound
But the louder voices rise
Only covers up your eyes
And you're trapped inside the lies that are your game

There's a change coming soon, can you see it?
There's a change coming soon, can you see it?
There's a change coming soon, can you see it?Embed
