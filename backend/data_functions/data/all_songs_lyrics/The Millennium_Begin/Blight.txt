Blight Lyrics
Oh, sing me a verse that will make
Everything that I do (Alright)
Everything is worse since we can't find
The one who is through (Wear white!)
You go your way, I go my way
Everything just seems to stop and go (Overnight)
I've been taken, you've been taken
Times have taken over what we know (To be right)

Oh, find me a way we can make
All the air that is here (Alright)
A time to collect all the dues
When we thought we were clear (In sight)
Houses falling, sponges calling
All of us are crawling far too long (With no light)
Micro-scheming adds to dreaming
Who can sing the one redeeming song? (Alright)

Hang on, don't you stop now
I think the time will come
We hold nothin', no gold
And love cannot be sold
I need to know that you're here
(Alright)Embed
