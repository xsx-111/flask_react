There Is Nothing More to Say LyricsOh if you will listen I will sing in your ear
Of some words that perhaps will sound strange
Don't you mind
And if you will listen then I know you will hear
What I say when I speak of the change you will find
There is something that you hear in so many of our songs
But it's something that we want you to know
Oh the time is going to come
When we're going to lead the way
You'll be shown the way
And shown the time
We only need to go
Oh if you will listen you will see what I mean
As you watch all the ways of the world that we're in
And if you will listen when you know what you've seen
You will watch and be ready when it's time to begin
There is something that you hear in so many of our songs
But it's something that we want you to know
Oh the time is going to come
When we're going to lead the way
You'll be shown the way
And shown the time
We only need to go
There is nothing more to say1Embed
