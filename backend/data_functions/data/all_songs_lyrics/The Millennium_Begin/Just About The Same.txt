Just About The Same LyricsOoooooh, lala lala
Ooooooh, lala lala

Stop for a moment just to see where you're going
If you're sure that that is what you wanna know
Now that you think that the end is worth knowing
Back to the start is where you wanna go

Hey, everybody is just about the same
Just about the same
Hey, when you finally see from where we came
From where we came
Ooooooh, lala lala
Ooooooh, lala lala, lalalala

Ask me a question and I'll give you an answer
Are you part of everybody? Yes you are
Where do you think all these people have come from
Are you the problem? Well I guess you are

Hey, everybody is just about the same
Just about the same
Hey, when you finally see from where we came
From where we came
Ooooooh, lala lala, lalalala
Ooooooh, lala lala, lalalala, lala lala, lalalala, lala lala, lalalalaEmbed
