Sing To Me Lyrics
All the things that I know I can feel
I might just feel with you
I'll tell of the things that can be real
If you want to make it true

Sing to me, make me stay
Show me how you love your way
Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba

And maybe I can show you that we can find
What we want to see
If you put your hand in mine
We'll go where you want to be

Walk with me, stay here by my side
And so free, forever we will ride

Sing to me, make me stay
Show me how you love your way
Show me how you love your way
Show me how you love your way
Show me how you love your way
Show me how you love your way...Embed
