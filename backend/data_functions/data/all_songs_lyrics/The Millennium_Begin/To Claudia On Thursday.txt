To Claudia On Thursday Lyrics
Take off your shoes and feel the grass
Lie back and let the hours pass
Don't give a thought to anything in the world
But you and me

Let the heavens kiss you with the breeze
Let the sunshine see you through the trees
Don't give a thought to anything in the world
But you and me

Just take your time
And let me get into your smile
Relax and find
Just what we can feel for a while

Open up your heart and breathe the air
Let the wind and light play in your hair
Don't give a thought to anything in the world
But you and me

Just take a look
And see all the love in the sky
And when you do
The love will reflect in your eye
Sing me a song without a sound
And I will hear it through the ground
Don't give a thought to anything in the world
But you and me

And everyoneEmbed
