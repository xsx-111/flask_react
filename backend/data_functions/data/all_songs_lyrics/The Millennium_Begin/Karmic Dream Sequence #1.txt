Karmic Dream Sequence #1 Lyrics
I have found shy corners of the world where you might be
I have lingered for you by the bright blue misty sea
In lonely walks down city streets
You are in everyone I meet
You are there, I know it's true
But where are you?

I've seen you slipping quietly across the ancient sand
I've heard you singing to the wind that put love upon your hand
But now I wonder where you've gone
How can I be so very wrong
You are there, I know it's true
But where are you?
Please tell me where are you

Come with me to the land of the crystal sea
Love is now and now is meant to be
I've captured you
You've captured me
All that's left is We

I have found shy corners of the world where you might be
I have lingered for you by the bright blue misty sea
In lonely walks down city streets
You are in everyone I meet
You are there, I know it's true
But where are you?
Please tell me where are you?
