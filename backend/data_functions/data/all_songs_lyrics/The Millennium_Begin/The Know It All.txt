The Know It All LyricsWhy don't you reincarnate any moment of your past?
Have you ever stopped to consider this could be your last life?
Hanging from the stony wall
One they called the Know It All
Took away his crystal ball
'Cause he said he saw
Mrs. Jones reads the newspaper every single day
They print what they know will make her want to buy their paper in the worst way
Hanging from the stony wall
One they called the Know It All
Took away his crystal ball
'Cause he said he saw
I think that this caper that they call life is getting strange
I think that those who can see should bring about a change
And if you tried you would be
Hanging from the stony wall
One they called the Know It All
They'll take away your crystal ball
'Cause you said you sawEmbed
