Some Sunny Day Lyrics
I can see a day when we'll know how to cry
There will come a time when we can sing to the sky
I can smile at you and you won't walk by me alone

I know life is going to be so sweet
We will all be dancing in the street
You will look at me and say
"So you're the one I have known"

Though this time, it may look like
It's not going to happen, ooh
All we have to do is close our eyes
And see that we are free to be

And I know that on some sunny day
All the love is going to come our way
You will smile at me and I will know
We're no longer alone

Though this time it may look like
It's not going to happen, ooh
All we have to do is close our eyes
And see that we are free to be
And I know that on some sunny day
All the love is going to come our way
You will smile at me and I will know
We're no longer alone
You will smile at me and I will know
We're no longer alone

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh...Embed
