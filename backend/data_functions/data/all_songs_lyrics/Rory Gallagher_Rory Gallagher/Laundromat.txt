Laundromat LyricsWhat do you think of that?
I'm sleeping down at the laundromat
If you should pass be sure to drop my bag
But I don't have no clothes to clean
To put inside the machine
One of the craziest place I've ever been
Come 'round and meet my friends
They'll be there with me right through to the end
Right through to the end
Right through to the end
Woah
Say I told you so
Maybe bad times come and go
You don't know that right now but then you'll never know
What do you think of that
I'm on the street like an old stray cat
If you should look for me you'd know exactly where to go
Well come 'round and meet my friends
Oh, they'll be there with me
With me to the end
With me to the end
Yeah
What do you think of that?
I'm sleeping down at the laundromat
If you should pass by drop right in
But I don't have no clothes to clean
To put inside the machine
One of the craziest place I've ever been
Oh, come around and meet my friends
They'll be there with me right through to the end
Right through to the end
Right through to the end
Right through to the endEmbed
