Just The Smile LyricsJust the smile that is spreading all over her face
Could warm up the room and set fire to the place
Yes it could, you know it could
Now the fog is clinging all over the town
Put one foot in front then you just might fall down
On the ground, she's in town
But like the rain that is falling all over the land
She cools down my mind when she touches my hand
Feels so good, yeah so good
Just the smile that is spreading all over her face
Could warm up the room and set fire to the place
Yes she could, you know it couldEmbed
