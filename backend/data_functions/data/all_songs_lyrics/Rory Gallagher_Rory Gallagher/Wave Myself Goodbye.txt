Wave Myself Goodbye LyricsWell I don't know anymore
I don't know why I feel so sore
I only know I love you more
I feel so blue I think I'll wave myself goodbye
The people say you fade away
From my mind you wouldn't stay
But you get stronger there everyday
You know I feel so alone I think I'll wave myself goodbye
This time next time it's all the same
I'll just go on playin a losin game
Until one day baby I'll even forget your name
Someday someday
It takes a fool too long to see
Can't make out the wood for the trees
I must have been blind as I could be
But now I feel so blue I think I'll wave myself goodbye
Well I don't know anymore
I've lost you for sure
I only know I want you more
I feel so blue I think I'll wave myself goodbyeEmbed
