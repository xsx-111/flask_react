For The Last Time LyricsYou've done me wrong
For the last time
You've sung your song
Now I'm going to sing mine
Out loud, so loud
Like the roaring sea
You've played around
For the last time
You've shown your claws
Now I'm going to show mine
Watch out, I'll be about
In the night
You ran around
Since the very first day
You've had your moment
Now I'm gonna have my play
So long, I'll be gone
In the night
You put me down
For the very last time
I hit the floor
But I got up on the count of nine
Goodbye, don't cry
When I'm goneEmbed
