Hands Up LyricsHands up reach for the sky
And I will tell you why
This is just a game I'm playin
You won't feel the same I'm betting now
Get up you know this time
That you made up your mind
Think of all the dreams you're chasin
Think of all the time you're wastin now
My world is upside down
My inside is inside out
I'm hangin to a leaf that's shakin
That's hangin to a branch that's breakin off now
Go out into the night
Left to the sky
You'll walk out the shoes you're wearin
Might even lose your blues, no tellin nowEmbed
