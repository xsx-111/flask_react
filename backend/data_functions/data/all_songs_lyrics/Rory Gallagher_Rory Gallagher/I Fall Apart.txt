I Fall Apart LyricsLike a cat that's playing with a ball of twine
That you call my heart
Oh, but baby is it so hard
To tell the two apart?
And so slowly you unwind me
'Til I fall apart
I'm only living for the hour
That I see your face
When that happens
I don't wanna be no other place
'Til the end of time
You'll be on my mind
I don't mind waiting for your love
For of time I've got plenty of
Rain or shine please bring out your love
Make it shine like the stars above
I'm only living for the moment
When I hear your voice
Oh, I'm waiting
I don't have any choice
And the day is long
So won't you come where you should be
Like a cat that's playing with a ball of twine
That you call my heart
Oh baby, is it so hard
To tell the two apart?
And so slowly you unwind it
'Til I fall apartEmbed
