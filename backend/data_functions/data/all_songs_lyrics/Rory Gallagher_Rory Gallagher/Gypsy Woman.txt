Gypsy Woman LyricsThe gypsy woman told me
You were your mother's bad luck child
The gypsy woman told me
You were your mother's bad luck child
You're having a good time now
You'll be having trouble after a while
Went to see the gypsy woman
To have my fortune told
She said run right home right away
And look through your keyhole
The gypsy woman told me
You were your mother's bad luck child
You're having a good time now
You'll be having bad times after a while
I believed everything the gypsy woman told me
Every single word she said
I ran right home right away
And looked through my keyhole
Another man in my bed
The gypsy woman told me
You were your mother's bad luck child
You're having a good time now
You'll be having bad times after a whileEmbed
