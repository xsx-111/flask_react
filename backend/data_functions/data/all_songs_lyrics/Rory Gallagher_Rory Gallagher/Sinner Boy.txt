Sinner Boy LyricsCity streets and rolling cars
The only sound you can hear
But you know you might be wrong
Just look right over here
Back up against the wall
Hands on the bottle
You're gonna walk on by
Then he cries you gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Take that sinner boy home
Wrap him up, keep him warm
He won't do no harm
Take him home right away
He's got no place to stay
Let him walk right inside your home
Go on and ask him his name
Let him try and explain
What in the world done him wrong
Tell the man, lift him up
Take away the paper cup
One more inside him won't do him no good
Sinner boy
Take that sinner boy home
Wrap him up, keep him warm
He won't do no harm
Take him home right away
He's got no place to stay
Let him walk right inside your home
Take that sinner boy home
Wrap him up, keep him warm
He won't do you, he won't do you no harmEmbed
