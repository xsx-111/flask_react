Well, by little I watched my love slow down
Yeah, yeah

Today you're laughing pretty baby
Tomorrow you could be cryin'

Today you're laughing woman
Tomorrow you could be cryin'

Tell me why all the good dogs can't ever run away
Yeah, yeah
Do you know what it means to be alone?
Today you're laughing pretty baby
Tomorrow you could be cryin'
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Do you know what it means to be alone?
Today you're laughing pretty baby
Tomorrow you could be cryin'Embed
