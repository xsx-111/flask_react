Most of It Lyrics
Alright, alright
Hard times (the most of it), upsides
Dark strikes, head high
Alright, alright (most of it)

I’m learning how to move
These mountains in my mind
I’m learning how to let go
When everything unwinds
And make the most of it
Just make the most of it
I’m learning how to be
When I don’t understand
I’m learning how to let go
'Cause it’s not in my hands
And make the most of it
Just make the most of it

And when weight of this journey takes its toll
You are the joy that moves me beyond control
I have a confidence deep inside my soul

'Cause I'm alright
Yes, I'm alright
Through the hard times
And the upsides
When the dark strikes
Keep my head high
'Cause I'm alright
I'll be alright
I’m learning how to live
In spite all of my fear
I’m learning how to hold on
To knowing You are near
And make the most of it (the most of it)
Just make the most of it (most of it)
I’m learning how to be
No matter what’s at hand
I’m learning how to hold on
Keep trusting in Your plan
And make the most of it (the most of it)
Just make the most of it (most of it)

And when weight of this journey takes its toll
You are the joy that moves me beyond control
I have a confidence deep inside my soul

'Cause I'm alright
Yes, I'm alright
Through the hard times
And the upsides
When the dark strikes
Keep my head high
'Cause I'm alright
I'll be alright
(Most of it)
(Most of it)
(Most of it)
(Most of it)

'Cause I'm alright, yes, I'm alright
Through the hard times and the upsides
When the dark strikes, keep my head high
'Cause I'm alright, I'll be alright

(Most of it)
(The most of it)Embed
