Gone Lyrics
I'm not what I seem
Only in this moment
Only in this moment I'm holding on
I'm still bound to bleed
This is just a moment
I thought you should know it
I'm gold then gone

I'm not what I seem
Only in this moment
Only in this moment I'm holding on
I'm no guarantee
I can barely focus
I know I seem hopeless
I'm gold then...

Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

I'm not what I seem
We can both be honest
I'm not what I promised
I'm off then on
Pray I find my peace
Pray I slay the dragon
Pray I break this madness and find the shore
"Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices. My flesh also dwells secure, for You will not abandon my soul to Sheol or let Your holy one see corruption. You make known to me the path of life; in Your presence there is fullness and joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore."Embed
