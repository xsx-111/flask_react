Lost? Lyrics
I’m lost in this place
At peace on my way
Your smile as I roam
Sings joy to my soul

All my running Your redemption retraced
At Your cross held my exhausted embrace
Now I wander in Your glorious maze
Lost in grace, lost in grace

I don’t want to escape
Enchanted, amazed
Wherever I go
No need for control

All my running Your redemption retraced
At Your cross held my exhausted embrace
Now I wander in Your glorious maze
Lost in grace, lost in grace

I’m in over my head, wrapped in light
Tapestries of wonder fill my eyes
Running under rainbows, so alive
The light of Your face
A vibrant array
My world is aglow
With color and hope

All my running Your redemption retraced
At Your cross held my exhausted embrace
Now I wander in Your glorious maze
Lost in grace, lost in graceEmbed
