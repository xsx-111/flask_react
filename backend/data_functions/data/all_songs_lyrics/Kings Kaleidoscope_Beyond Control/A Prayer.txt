A Prayer Lyrics
Will I fall or will I misstep?
Will I fall or will I misstep?
Will I call You with my last breath?
Will You be there for me after?
Will I waste inside the silence
Where the fear is fucking violent?
Wicked sinner thrown to lions
With no hope on the horizon
Will I fall or will I misstep?

If I fall or if I misstep
If I fall or if I misstep
If I call You with my last breath
Will You be there for me after?
'Cause I'm wasting in this silence
And my fear is fucking violent
I'm a child thrown to lions
Is there hope on the horizon
If I fall or if I misstep?

Jesus, where are You?
Am I still beside You?
Jesus, where are You?
Am I still beside You?
Jesus, where are You?
Am I still beside You?
Am I still beside You?
Jesus, where are You?
Jesus, where are You?
I’m right beside you!
I feel what you feel!
And I’m here to hold you
When death is too real!
You know, I died, too!
I was terrified!
I gave myself for you!
I was crucified
Because I love you!
I love you, child!
I love you!9Embed
