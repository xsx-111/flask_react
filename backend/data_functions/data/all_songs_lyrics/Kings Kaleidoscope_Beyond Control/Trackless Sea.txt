Trackless Sea Lyrics
Jesus, the calm that fills my chest
This peace unstirred, this joy of rest
My weary soul has found a charm
Within the shelter of Your arms

In desert wastes I fear no dread
I care not where my way is led

Fearless I walk the trackless sea
'Cause all my life is life with Thee
Fearless I walk the trackless sea
'Cause all my life is life with Thee

I’m holding on to feelings in between
The faith I want is bound in apathy
I’m tired of doubt and feeling incomplete
Still, this hope I hold is my reality

Mine
Reality
Reality
Reality
Hidden Track: "Hope"
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
You're my hope! Hold on!
Hold on, hold on to me!
You're my hope! Hold on!
Hold on to me, hold on to me!
You're my hope! Hold on!
Hold on, hold on to me!
You're my hope! Hold on!
Hold on to me, hold on to me!
You're my hope! Hold on!
Hold on, hold on to me!
You're my hope! Hold on!
Hold on to me, hold on to me!3Embed
