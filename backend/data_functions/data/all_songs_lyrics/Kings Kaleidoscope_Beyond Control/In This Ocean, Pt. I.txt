In This Ocean, Pt. I Lyrics
Here we go, ready
1, 2, here we go
1, 2, 3, 4

It's okay to be afraid
It’s alright in this ocean, this ocean
Come and feel, this is for real
Come alive in this ocean, this ocean
If we wait, it's no escape
We’re alive in this ocean, this ocean
To be whole, beyond control
Is to die

We’re afraid to set sail
We’re afraid to exhale
Afraid of adventure
We just stumble and stall
'Til we crumble and crawl
Back to our shelter
It’s enough that He’s here
It’s enough that He knows our frame
We are bound to the end
On a journey through fire and rain
It's okay to be afraid
It’s alright in this ocean, this ocean
Come and feel, this is for real
Come alive in this ocean, this ocean
If we wait, it's no escape
We’re alive in this ocean, this ocean
To be whole, beyond control
Is to die

Stepping out into faith
Terrified of our fate
Tense and uncertain
As our feet leave the shore
And the sails fill and roar
We need assurance
It’s enough that He calls us His own
And He knows our names
We are bound to the end
On a journey through fire and rain

It's okay to be afraid
It’s alright in this ocean, this ocean
Come and feel, this is for real
Come alive in this ocean, this ocean
If we wait, it's no escape
We’re alive in this ocean, this ocean
To be whole, beyond control
Is to die
Sailing, sailing, sailing, sailing…
Drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting…
Sailing, sailing, sailing...

Will You ever hear me call Your name?
Will You keep me when I can't think straight?
How am I supposed to live afraid?
I just wish this all would change
Are we drifting out here all alone?
In this haunted, empty, great unknown
Will You really come and bring shalom?
Will You breathe hope in my bones?Embed
