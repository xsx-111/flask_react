DUST Lyrics
Dust to earth and ash to ocean
(Evanescent, fading fast
You are all I really have)
I'm not home 'til heaven opens
(Life's a vapor while it lasts
You are all I really have)

Living for experiences
I romanticize thrill
Maximize my achievements
But I'm not satisfied still

I'm realizing, that all my striving
Is chasing wind, is chasing wind
But you freed me, so I can just be
Nothing to prove, nothing to lose

Dust to earth and ash to ocean
(Evanescent, fading fast
You are all I really have)
I'm not home 'til heaven opens
(Life's a vapor while it lasts
You are all I really have)
The vapor of humanity
A tapestry of vanity
The cycle of depravity
A carousel of fantasy

But you freed me, so I can just be
Nothing to prove, nothing to lose

Dust to earth and ash to ocean
(Evanescent, fading fast
You are all I really have)
I'm not home 'til heaven opens
(Life's a vapor while it lasts
You are all I really have)
Dust to earth and ash to ocean
(Evanescent, fading fast
You are all I really have)
I'm not home 'til heaven opens
(Life's a vapor while it lasts
You are all I really have)

Don't let me fall apart
Be near my wandering heart
Hold me closely through this race
Help me embrace Your pace
Don't let me fall apart
Be near my wandering heart
Hold me closely through this race
Help me embrace Your pacing
