Sabotage / Home Lyrics"Sabotage"

If this is living
Then I am finally finding out
Life’s misleading
If this is freedom
Then I'm not sure if I want it now
I have reached the ceiling
If this is success
Well then I should have expected less
I could keep on dreaming
'Cause if I’m honest
I am beginning to have my doubts
What do I believe in?

I can’t escape this sabotage
Taking what I want
But slowly I’m discovering
Exactly what is wrong
I pour myself out for myself
Such a selfish fool
When all I want is You
When all I want is You
This isn't living
I’m so defeated and uninspired
Life’s deceiving
This isn't freedom
I never stop, always running tired
I just keep on reaching
This isn’t success
I’m just a jumble of work and stress
And I’m always reeling
And if I’m honest
I am beginning to have my doubts
Who do I believe in?

I can’t escape this sabotage
Taking what I want
But slowly I’m discovering
Exactly what is wrong
I pour myself out for myself
Such a selfish fool
When all I want is You
When all I want is You
"Home"
Now, as I cross this parted sea
All I had is behind me
With my home now far from view
This is home right here with You
You have sabotaged this sea
Now You're walking here with me
This is home, right here with You
I am home, right here with You
Wade in the water
Wade in the water, children
Life is a restless maze
You are my hiding place
Life is a reckless haze
You are my endless grace4Embed
