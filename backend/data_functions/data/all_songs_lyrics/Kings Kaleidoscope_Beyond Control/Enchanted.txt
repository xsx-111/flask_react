Enchanted Lyrics
I'm trying to stay safe
In a digital escape
In an isolated world keep it tame
Cold and calculated truths
A reality I choose
In a regulated world feel no pain

Shadow in a matrix, searching for a light
Captive of the jungle, hiding in the night

Break me free to live enchanted
Enchanted
Beyond control
Control

I'm connected in a daze
Roam unconscious disengaged
In a simulated world I sustain
Swimming senseless through a void
Ease my appetite with noise
In a stimulated world go insane
Shadow in a matrix, searching for a light
Captive of the jungle, hiding in the night

Break me free to live enchanted
Enchanted
Beyond control

Hide me
Hide me
Hide me in your mystery
Hide me
Hide me
Hide me in your mystery

Break me free to live enchanted
Enchanted
Beyond control

Beyond control
Beyond... control
Control, control, beyond...
Beyond
This wilderness is wild
I'm living as a child, enchanted
Enchanted, beyond, beyond
Beyond control
Beyond, beyond, beyond control
Enchanted, enchanted
Enchanted...
Enchanted, enchanted
Enchanted, enchanted...Embed
