There and Back Again Lyrics
Take, take your time
Smell the roses, but steal the vines
Don't wait for the hands of time
To second guess and change your mind

Now shine
Here's your moment to shine
Shine

Lay it down, my friend
Close your eyes, breathe in
And I'll take you
There and back again
No more questions why
I'm not so surprised
Why you have
Been there and back again

Replace, replace that line
That spoke to you
But showed no signs
To be alive
So are you livin' or dead?
Have you made a choice to hear your voice
Or hold on to what they said?
Now shine
Here's your moment to shine
Shine

Lay it down, my friend
Close your eyes, breathe in
And I'll take you
There and back again
No more questions why
I'm not so surprised
Why you have
Been there and back again

Back again, back again
Back again, back again

Lay it down, my friend
Close your eyes, breathe in
And I'll take you
There and back again
No more questions why
I'm not so surprised
Why you have
Been there and back again
Lay it down, my friend
Close your eyes, breathe in
And I will take you
There and back again
No more questions why
I'm not so surprised
Why you have
Been there and back againEmbed
