Crashed Lyrics
Well, I was moving at the speed of sound
Head-spinning, couldn't find my way around, and
Didn't know that I was going down
Yeah, yeah
Where I've been, well, it's all a blur
What I was lookin' for, I'm not sure
Too late, didn't see it coming
Yeah, yeah

And then I crashed into you
And I went up in flames
Could've been the death of me
But then you breathed your breath in me
And I crashed into you
Like a runaway train
You will consume me, but I can't walk away

Somehow, I couldn't stop myself
I just wanted to know how it felt
Too strong, I couldn't hold on
Yeah, yeah
Now I'm just trying to make some sense
Out of how and why this happened
Where we're headed, there's just no knowing
Yeah, yeah
And then I crashed into you
And I went up in flames
Could've been the death of me
But then you breathed your breath in me
And I crashed into you
Like a runaway train
You will consume me, but I can't walk away

From your face, your eyes
Are burning to me
You saved me, you gave me
Just what I need
Oh, just what I need

And then I crashed into you
And I went up in flames
Could've been the death of me
But then you breathed your breath in me
And I crashed into you
Like a runaway train
You will consume me, but I can't walk away

And then I crashed into you
And then I crashed into you
And then I crashed into you
And then I crashed into you
And I crashed into you
Like a runaway train
You will consume me, but I can't walk away1Embed
