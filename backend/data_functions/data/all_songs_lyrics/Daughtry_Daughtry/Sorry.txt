Sorry Lyrics
Will you listen to my story?
It'll just be a minute
How can I explain?
What ever happened here
Never meant to hurt you
How could I cause you so much pain?

When I say I'm sorry
Will you believe me?
Listen to my story
Say you won't leave me
When I say I'm sorry
Can you forgive me?
When I say I'll always be there
Will you believe
Will you believe me?

All the words that I come up with
They're like gasoline on flames
There's no excuse, no explanation
Believe me
If I could I'd undo what I did wrong
I'd give away all that I own
When I say I'm sorry
Will you believe me?
Listen to my story
Say you won't leave me
When I say I'm sorry
Can you forgive me?
When I say I'll always be there
Will you believe

If I told you
I've been cleaning my soul
And if I promised you
I'll regain control
Will you open your door
And let me in?
Take me for who I am
And not for who I've been?
Who I've been

When I say I'm sorry
Will you believe me?
Listen to my story
Say you won't leave me
When I say I'm sorry
Can you forgive me?
When I say I'll always be there
Will you believe
When I say I'm sorry
When I say I'm sorry
When I say I'm sorry
When I say I'm sorry
When I say I'm sorry
Can you forgive me?
When I say I'll always be there
Will you believe?Embed
