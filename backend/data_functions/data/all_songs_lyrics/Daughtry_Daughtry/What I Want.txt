What I Want Lyrics
It always seemed that I was sorry for the things that I did
But never did a thing about it 'til I let you in
It's kinda funny 'bout the time that I was fallin' apart
You came and put me back together now

'Cause what I want and what I need
Has now become the same things you've been offering
As days go by, I've finally become what you want me to be

I still remember all the stupid things that I've said and done
But still, you stuck around with me when all your friends said, "Run!"
You've given me a name, I found myself inside all the flames
Becoming everything for you again

'Cause what I want and what I need
Has now become the same things you've been offering
As days go by, I've finally become what you want me to be

Don't tell me you saw it all along
God help me, I never knew I belonged
Guess I was wrong
'Cause what I want and what I need
Has now become the same things you've been offering
As days go by, I've finally become what you want me to be
'Cause what I want and what I need
Has now become the same things you've been offering
As days go by, I've finally become what you want me to beEmbed
