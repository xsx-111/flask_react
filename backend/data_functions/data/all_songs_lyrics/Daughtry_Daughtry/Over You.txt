Over You Lyrics
Now that it's all said and done
I can't believe you were the one
To build me up then tear me down
Like an old abandoned house
And what you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath
I fell too far, was in way too deep
Guess I let you get the best of me

Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought to doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally getting better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
And spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you
You took a hammer to these walls
Dragged the memories down the hall
Packed your bags and walked away
There was nothing I could say
And when you slammed the front door shut
A lot of others opened up
So did my eyes so I could see
That you never were the best for me

Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally gettin' better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
And spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through, I got over you

Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally gettin' better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
And spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
(Woooahhh)
I'm putting my heart back together
(Woooahhh)

'Cause I got over you
(Woooahhh)
I got over you
(Woooahhh)
I got over you
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you8Embed
