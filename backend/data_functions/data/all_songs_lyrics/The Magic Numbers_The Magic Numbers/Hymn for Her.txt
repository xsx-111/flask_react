Hymn for Her LyricsAs I wandered past through the old grey house
And the children laughed for they'd found me out
And the silly things I do when I'm around you
Make for wanting to believe that I have found you
And if Sunday rain
And if Sunday rain
And if Sunday rain
I don't wanna know
Just like I won't forget your face when I
Wake to find you here
Oh my lover won't you get away?
Love or loathe I need to feel again
It won't hurt to find love in the wrong place
I've been hurt before but all the scars have rearranged
It won't hurt to choose the path that we all walk alone
Oh my lord I I pray for just one day
Love or loathe I need to feel again
It won't hurt to find love in the wrong place
I've been hurt before but all the scars have rearranged
It won't hurt to choose the path that we all walk alone
And you love and you love and it never dies
Oh, when you love and you love and it never lies
Oh, and you love and you love and it never dies
Oh, when you love and you love and it never lies
Hymn for her
Hymn for her
Hymn for her
Hymn for her
It won't hurt to find love in the wrong place
I've been hurt before but all the scars have rearranged
It won't hurt to find love in the wrong place
I've been hurt before but all the scars have rearranged
It won't hurt to choose the path that we all walk alone
Oh my lord I pray for just one day
Love or loathe I need to feel againEmbed
