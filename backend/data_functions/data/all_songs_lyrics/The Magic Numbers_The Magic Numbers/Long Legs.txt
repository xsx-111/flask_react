Long Legs LyricsLong legs
Don't give me no head rush in the morning
Oh baby, it's bad too bad
I don't think I'll ever see your face again
And I don't wanna lose your love
And I don't wanna choose just one
Cos I've been having too much fun
Oh
Oh it's bad too bad
I don't think I'll ever feel the same again
Oh baby, I'll beg I'll beg
Cos I found it but I don't know what it is
And I don't wanna lose your love
And I don't wanna choose just one
Cos I've been having too much fun
Oh but it's gone..
And I don't wanna lose your love
And I don't wanna choose
Cos I've been having too much fun
Oh but it's gone
Long legs don't give me no head rush in the morning
Oh baby baby, I'll beg I'll beg
Cos you're leaving and I won't know how it ends
And I don't wanna lose your love
And I don't wanna choose just one
Cos I've been having too much fun
Oh but it's gone
And I don't wanna lose your love
And I don't wanna choose just one
Cos I've been having too much fun
Oh but it's goneEmbed
