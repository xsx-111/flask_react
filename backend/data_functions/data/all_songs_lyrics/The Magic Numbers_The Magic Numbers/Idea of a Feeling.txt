Idea of a Feeling LyricsI may have had an idea of a feeling
But it disappeared just as I was reaching
Now I think of all the nights I spend drinking
And if all my nights are gray
What if all you nights are gray
Oh there's a hole in the hall
And I'd give everything just to know
That you're looking in and you call me
Oh but don't forget to leave, at least your heart aches
And I've been trying to cry
Oh I've been a fool but I'm trying
And now all my nights are gray
What if all your nights are gray?
Oh there's a hole in the hall
And I'd give everything just to know
That you're looking in and you call meEmbed
