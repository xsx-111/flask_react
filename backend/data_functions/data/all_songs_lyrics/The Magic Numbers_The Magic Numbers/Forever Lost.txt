Forever Lost LyricsDarling, what you gonna do now
Now that you noticed
It all went wrong
I've been, I've been thinking
That you don't know me anymore
Don't let the sun be the one
To change you baby
I wanna learn how to lie
If I'm to know
Cos I wanna go where the people go
Cos I'm forever lost
Darling, what you gonna say now
Now that you noticed
It all went wrong
Looks like I'm driving
My friends all crazy
They say that they don't know me anymore
Don't let the sun be the one
To change you baby
I wanna learn how to lie
If I'm to know
Cos I wanna go where the people go
Cos I'm forever lost
Oh yeah I'm forever lost
Looks like it all went wrong
Looks like it all went wrong
Looks like it all went wrong
Looks like it all went wrong
What am I to do
What am I to do
Don't let the sun be the one
To change you baby
I wanna learn how to lie
If I'm to know
Cos I wanna go where the people go
Cos I'm forever lost
Oh yeah I'm forever lost
Darling what you gonna do now
Now that you noticed
It all went wrong
Now that you noticed
Now that you noticedEmbed
