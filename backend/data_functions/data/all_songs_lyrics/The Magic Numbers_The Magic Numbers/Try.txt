Try LyricsLoneliness, don't come around here
I've boarded up all the doors
There's nothing to give no more
I recall, a time when I knew it all
Wish someone done me wrong
So I can then do no wrong
But if you try to keep moving on
And it seems like it's always so hard
And if you left me
Darling I know I'll be found
And if you need me
Don't you let me know
It's alright...
Maybe I, had too little love to realise
All that I tried to give
Could never, ever be enough
But if you try to keep moving on
And it seems like it's always so hard
But if you left me
Darling I know I'll be found
And if you left me
And if you try
Oh and if you try
Oh and if you try, try
Oh and if you try, try
Oh and if you try, try
Oh and if you try...Embed
