Love Me Like You LyricsDon't let your white dress wear you out
Oh it hurts to look in your eyes
'Cause honey I can see him
All my life
I'd hurt the ones I'd loved
Oh but baby you can turn it round
She don't love me like you
She don't know what you do
And it's so hard
She don't care what you say
So just say it, say it anyway
It's so hard
All my life, they tried to push me down
Oh but baby you can turn it round
Oh but honey I still see him
Don't let your friends tell you why
'Cause I'm a bad, bad, bad
I'm the one
Oh but baby you can turn it on
She don't love me like you
She don't know what you do
And it's so hard
She don't care what you say
So just say it, say it anyway
It's so hard
All those years gone by
I only wanna find a way
To make it hard for you
All those years gone by
I only wanna find a way
To make it hard for you
You'll never forget it
The way that she let
She don't feel the same
I only wanna find a way
To make it hard for you
You'll never forget it
The way that she let
She don't feel the same
I only wanna find a way
To make it hard for you
She'll never forget it
The way that she let
She don't feel no pain
I only wanna find a way
To make it up to you
She'll never forget it
The way that she let
She don't feel the same
I only wanna find a way
I only wanna find
I only wanna find
She don't love me like you
She don't love me like you
She don't love me like you
She don't love me like you
She don't love
She don'tEmbed
