This Love LyricsThrough the gates of life she left
Through the years I've wept
Lying face down in the ground
I can't hold you now
Why did I choose to refuse you
Its not that I used you
I left when I should've
Believed that I could of held on
But you never let go
Or at least I don't think so
And if all I've got are these tears
Will the sun come up
And rid me of darkness again
Throw my hands up
Why did I choose to refuse you
Its not that I used you
When all of my words
Were withheld and unheard
I did fall
But you never let go
Or at least I don't think so
Said you know that I'm here
Said you know that I'm here
And if all I want is a room with you
To break down the windows and pull you through
If all I see is an empty sky
That pulls you out from the snow
I don't wanna know This Love
I don't wanna know
It's all I'll ever have
This love
I don't wanna know
This love
This heart
This is waking up
This love
This heart
This is waking up
This love
This heart
This is waking up
This love
This heart
This is waking up
This love
Maybe we can learn
This love
Maybe we can learn
This loveEmbed
