Wheels on Fire LyricsWheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
Well there's a light
And there's a hope
Come swing me baby
From this here rope
I sold you a lie
And prayed that maybe
Someday you'd return it
Lord knows I've earnt it
I keep finding words that leave you - I told you I don't mind
Something tells me I'm not meant to - I told you I don't mind
I keep finding words that leave you
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
Well there's a light
And there's a hope
Come swing me baby
From this here rope
I sold you a lie
And preyed that maybe
Someday you'd return it
Lord knows I've earnt it
I keep finding words that leave you - I told you I don't mind
Something tells me I'm not meant to - I told you I don't mind
I keep finding words that leave you
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbyeEmbed
