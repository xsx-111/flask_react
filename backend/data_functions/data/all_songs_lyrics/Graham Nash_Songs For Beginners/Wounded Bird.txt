Wounded Bird Lyrics
I've watched you go through changes
That no man should face alone
Take to heel or tame the horse
The choice is still your own
But arm yourself against the pain
A wounded bird can give
And in the end remember
It's with you you have to live
And in the end remember
It's with you you have to live

Stand your ground, I think you've got
The guts it takes to win
But you must learn to turn the key
Before she'll let you in
And understand the problems
Of the girl you want so near
Or you'll wear the coat of questions
'til the answer hat is here
You'll wear the coat of questions
'til the answer hat is here

Serenade your angel with a love song from your eyes
Grow a little taller
Even though your age defies
Feel a little smaller
And in stature you will rise
A hobo or a poet
Must kill dragons for a bride
And humble pie is always hard to swallow with your prideEmbed
