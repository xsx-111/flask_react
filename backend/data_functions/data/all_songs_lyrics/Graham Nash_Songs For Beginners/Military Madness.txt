Military Madness LyricsAh, one, two, three, four
In an upstairs room in Blackpool
By the side of a northern sea
The army had my father
And my mother was having me
Military madness was killing my country
Solitary sadness comes over me
And after the school was over
And I moved to the other side
I found another country
But I never lost my pride
Military madness was killing the country
Solitary sadness creeps over me
And after the wars are over
And the body count is finally filed
I hope The Man discovers
What's driving the people wild
Military madness
Is killing our country
So much sadness
Between you and me
War, war, war, war
War, war
War, war
War, war
War, war
War, war
War, war
War, war
War, war
War, warEmbed
