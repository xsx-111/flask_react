I Used to Be a King LyricsI used to be a king
And everything around me turned to gold
I thought I had everything
And now I'm left without a hand to hold
But it's all right, I'm okay, how are you
For what it's worth, I must say I loved you
And in my bed late at night, I miss you
Someone is going to take my heart
But no one is going to break my heart again
I used to be a king
And everything around me turned to rust
It's 'cause I built my life on sand
And I watched it crumble in the dust
Yeah, but it's all right, I'm okay, I want to know how you are
And what it's worth, I must say I loved you as you are
And in my bed where are you
Someone is going to take my heart
But no one is going to break my heart again
Someone is going to take my heart
But no one is going to break my heart again
And I used to be a king
But everything around me turned around
But I know all I have to do is sing
And I'll lift myself way off the ground
Yeah, but it's all right, I'm okay, how are you
For what it's worth, I must say I loved you
And in my bed, late at night, God I'll miss you
Someone is going to take my heart
But no one is going to break my heart again
No, no, no, noEmbed
