Man in the Mirror Lyrics
On the end of a tightrope
I'm over the town
I'd be good in a circus
But so would a clown
From the way that I feel
All my hang-ups are down
In the middle of nowhere
I found me a tree
And the fruit that we live on
Reminds me of me
Though we live in the air
I'm not sure that we're free

And I don't really have much to say
'Cause I'm living from day to day, somewhere
And I don't care what the people say
'Cause if everyone knows the way, we're nowhere

Two and two make four
They never make five
And as long as we know it
We all can survive
Make sure that the things you do
Keep us alive
And I don't really have much to say
'Cause I'm living from day to day, somewhere
And I don't care what the people say
'Cause if everyone knows the way, we're nowhere

Is the image I'm making
The image I see
When the man in the mirror
Is talking to meEmbed
