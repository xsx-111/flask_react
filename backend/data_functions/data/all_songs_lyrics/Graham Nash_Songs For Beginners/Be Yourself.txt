Be Yourself Lyrics
How does it feel
When life doesn't seem real
And you're floating about on your own
Your life is uncertain
So you draw the curtain
Pretending there's nobody home
But don't theorize
Look in your eyes
They can't tell lies
Though you disguise what you see
The mirror is free
But we once had a savior
But by our behavior
The one that was worth it is gone
Songbirds are talking
And the runners are walking
A prodigal son is coming home
And don't theorize
Look in his eyes
They won't tell lies
But if he defies what you see
He'll give you the key
Be yourself
Be yourself
Be yourself
Be yourself

We needed a tutor
So built a computer
And we programmed ourselves not to see
The truth and the lying
The dead and the dying
A silent majority
But don't theorize
Look in their eyes
Are they telling lies
The ones that they learned on TV
What a way to be free

Be yourself
Be yourself
Free yourself
Free yourself
See yourself
See yourself
Then you can free yourself
Be yourself
Be yourselfEmbed
