Independant Intavenshan Lyrics
Mek them gwaan
No outcome
But a reel of the real writers storm
Mek them gwaan
No outcome
But a wheel of the real writers storm
What a cheek
Them think we meek
And we can't speak up for we self
What a cheek them think we’re weak
When we can't stand up 'pon we feet
But make them gwaan
No outcome
But a reel of the real writers storm
Mek them gwaan
No outcome
For in the end we’ll walk thru the storm

The SWE can't set we free
The IMG can't do it for we
The communist party
Cho' them too arty-farty
And the labour rights men
Not go fight for your rights
So mek them gwaan
No outcome
But in the end as we'll walk right thru the storm
So mek them gwaan
No outcome
But in the end as we'll walk right thru the storm
What a cheek
Them think we meek
And we can't speak up for we self
What a cheek
Them think we weak
And we can't stand up ’pon we feet
But make them gwaan
No outcome
And in the ends we’ll walk right thru the storm
So make them gwaan
No outcome
And in the ends we'll walk right thru the storm

The CRE can’t set me free
The TUC can't do it for me
The Liberal Party them is not very hearty
And the Tory Party
I no feel no party
So mek them gwaan
No outcome
But a reel of the real writers storm
So mek them gwaan
No outcome
But a wheel of the real writers storm
