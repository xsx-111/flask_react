Time Come LyricsIt soon come
It soon come
Look out! look out! look out!
Fruit soon ripe
Fe tek wi bite
Strength soon come
Fe wi fling wi mite
It soon come
It soon come
Look out! look out! look out!
Wi feel bad
Wi look sad
Wi smoke weed
An if yu eye sharp
Read de vialence inna wi eye
Wi goin smash de sky wid wi bad bad blood
It soon come
It soon come
Is de shadow walkin behind yu
Is I stannup rite before yu
Look out!
But it too late now
I did warn yu
When yu fling mi inna prison
I did warn yu
When yu kill Oluwale
I did warn yu
When yu beat Joshua Francis
I did warn yu
When yu pick pan de Panthers
I did warn yu
When yu jack mi up gainst de wall
Ha didnt bawl
But I did warn yu
Now yu si fire burning in mi eye
Smell badness pan mi breat
Feel vialence, vialence
Burstin outta mi
Look out!
It too late now
I did warn yuEmbed
