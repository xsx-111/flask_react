Forces of Viktry LyricsForces of Viktry
And we're coming right thru
Yeah the forces of viktry
Know what you're gonna do
We mek a likkle beat
In 1978
And they fight and they fight
And they feed the state
Them holler
Which is forward
We knock â€˜pon the gate
Them holler
Which is forward
And there's nothing at the gate
Yeah, the Forces of Viktry
And we're coming right thru
Yeah the forces of viktry
Know what you're gonna do
We dressed in red
And we're feelin' dread
We dressed in green
And we're feelin' mean
We dressed in purple
And we're dressed in Yellow
We dressed in Blue
And we're coming right thru
Yeah, the Forces of Viktry
And we're coming right thru
Yeah the forces of viktry

Coming with their army
So don't you get balmy
Them coming with their blade
And them drive you insane
Coming with their bodies
And their mek their rounds
Coming with their tank
And Babylon get bombed
