If My Heart Was a House Lyrics
You're the sky that I fell through
And I remember the view whenever I'm holding you
The sun hung from a string
Looking down on the world as it warms over everything
Chills run down my spine as our fingers entwine
And your sighs harmonize with mine
Unmistakably, I can still feel your heart
Beat fast when you dance with me

We got older and I should've known
(Do you feel alive?)
That I'd feel colder when I walk alone
(Oh, but you'll survive)
So I may as well ditch my dismay
Bombs away
Bombs away

Circle me and the needle moves gracefully back and forth
If my heart was a compass, you'd be north
Risk it all 'cause I'll catch you if you fall
Wherever you go, if my heart was a house, you'd be home

It makes me smile because you said it best
I would clearly feel blessed if the sun rose up from the West
Flower balm perfume, all my clothes smell like you
'Cause your favorite shade is navy blue
I walk slowly when I'm on my own
(Do you feel alive?)
Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone
(Oh, but you'll survive)
So I may as well ditch my dismay
Bombs away
Bombs away

Circle me and the needle moves gracefully back and forth
If my heart was a compass, you'd be north
Risk it all 'â€‹cause I'll catch you if you fall
Wherever you go, if my heart was a house, you'd be home
If my heart was a house, you'd be home3Embed
