The Saltwater Room (Ocean Eyes Version) Lyrics
I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay, on the shore
Staring up at the stars that aren't there anymore
I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
So like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound
To my motion fatigue, farewell
With your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together isn't ever quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time

Can you believe that the crew has gone
And they wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep
So I can hardly relax or even oversleep
But I feel warm with your hand in mine
When we walk along the shoreline
I guess we'll never know why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
Yeah, all the time
All the time

Time together isn't ever quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Time together isn't ever quite enough
When we're apart what ever are you thinking of?
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time
Yeah, all the time1Embed
