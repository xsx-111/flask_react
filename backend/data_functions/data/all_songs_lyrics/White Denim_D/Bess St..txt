Bess St. LyricsYou don't know where you're going
You know you're not stayin' here
Oh, you can last another minute
Or you can last you through the year
You wanna own your confusion
You wanna own your confusion
You wanna do more amusin'
You wanna own your confusion
Why i-i-i
Why i-i-ow
Why i-i-i
Why i-i-ow
Maybe you shoulda been a butcher
You cut the pig for your friends
You're seduced by ideas
You break 'em all, you make 'em bend
Ooh
Ooh
Unimpressible on Bess St
Unavailable and discrete
Sustainable and so neat
Getting comfy in your new seat
Ooh
Ooh
Unimpressible on Bess St
Unavailable and discrete
Sustainable and so neat
Getting comfy in your new seat
Unimpressible on Bess St
Unavailable and discrete
Sustainable and so neat
Getting comfy in your new seatEmbed
