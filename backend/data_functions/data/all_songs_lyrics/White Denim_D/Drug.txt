Drug LyricsAll my folks and all you folks
We all beat around and keep our hopes
And talk drugs
We can take drugs
We can talk drugs
Measuring the weight in a flash and they
Anesthetized by the things that we say
For drugs
Oh for drugs
For drugs
For drugs
We are looking for counsel
We are looking for a place to dissolve
What could be the answer
To the voice at the end of a call
But just a little feeling
Just to replace it all
Just to replace it all
Just to replace it all
We write the lines in the palms of our hands
Revising the terms in our list of demands
For drugs
Oh for drugs
For drugs
For drugsEmbed
