Burnished LyricsThe bird and the snake
Over the sky how they fight
Two countries that kiss
Cross a river at night
A burnished mistake
How it gleams in the night
A piece of hot clay
The fine edge of a life
A relevant take on the nature of giving is more than I'm able to lift
A meaningful shake on the order of nature should be like sort of a gift
Apparently used to the musings of angels we chirp in the arms of a birch
Now you're gonna come and try to tell me now to leave
How you gonna come and try to tell me now to leave
I've been laying brick a'roofing house and laying seed
You've been layin' 'round absorbin' dirt amassin' need
How you gonna come and try to tell me now to leave
How you gonna come and try to tell me now to leaveEmbed
