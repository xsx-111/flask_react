Anvil Everything LyricsCrossed an ocean
Faced a fear
You were on a constant
But you didn't do it here
See the great collecting sunsets
Driving tunnels in their cars
See the other actors waiting
To take the kick in the dark
You know it's cruel
But you're careful
Anvil everything, your direction
Canvas memory and honor
Your heart concrete upon defeat
Watching cars leaping from the ground
Even when your heart feels like a gift you give
It isn't
It's one of a number of things
Performing a function in the body
Anvil everything, your direction
Canvas memory and honor
Even when your heart's a play thing
It's a given, it isn't
When nothing ever really happens
Anvil everything, your direction
Canvas memory and honorEmbed
