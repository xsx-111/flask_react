Is and Is and Is LyricsSailing and eyes wide
See billowing light at night
And then only color
Is and is and is, as it is
Oh it is and is and is, as it is
Framing flies in flight
Cayman bites that might
Cost them their lives
But it is and is and is, as it is
Oh it is and is and is, as it is
Their leaves live floating in the wind
Their road’s wheel starting to bend
Their house and it’s never tense
For what is and is and is, as it is
What is and is and is,  as it is
Katie was full of memories
She said “it won’t belong and it will never be the one”
Rudy was prone to believe in things
He said “It won’t be wrong unless we let it be the one”
Movement took hold inexplicably
Led everything onto some trickery but worse
That eve their eyes seem bright
On prayers they did not recite
But underneath them
What it is and is and is, did exist
What it is and is and is, did exist
Self-styled hunters diagnosed
Katie’s feeling as she mopped a kitchen floor
Rudy’s placed medic pictures in his hole
To discover he’d been wiped from them all
Composing disbelief with sounds made in the dark
Directing their relief, they formed electric arc
They formed electric arc
Katie was full of memories
She said “They don’t belong and I will never be the one"
Rudy let go of his dignity he said “It might be wrong but I will let them be the one”
Comfort came so quickly
They could leave behind their history .. ??
