Dead, Drunk and Naked LyricsWhen I was a young boy I sniffed a lot of glue
Mom sent me to rehab, they told me what to do
We didn't have much money; the Lord picked up the tab
They made me write Him love songs, sitting in my room
Now I just drink whiskey and drive around my friends
Get a haircut, get a job, maybe born again
And if you're living badly, we'll tell you how to live
Dead, drunk, and naked…
If you're out there listening, I just want you to know
I been doing just fine, psychiatrists tell me so
My scars are patched up; my arms have almost healed
My demons almost tranquilized, my pains almost killed
Me and old Jack Daniel's, become the best of friends
We got all them Baptists to die for our sins
I know the lord is coming
The South will rise again! (Dead, drunk, and naked)
Daddy used to tell me, everything comes down to what they say about you when you're not around
And I wish that he was here now, I'm sure he would be proud
No one talks about me now
The voices are too loud
So if you come to see me, I'm sure you'll be impressed
By how well I'm behaving and how well I'm dressed
If you come to see me, hope you're coming soon
Dead, drunk, and naked…1Embed
