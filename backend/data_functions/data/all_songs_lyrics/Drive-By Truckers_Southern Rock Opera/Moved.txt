Moved LyricsI used to live down in Alabama
Where the river's so muddy gotta watch where you step
Figurin' out things by the Railroad Bridge
And a cousin or two a-want to give me just a little help
There's damn sure not much to do down here
'Cept to cook it down
And run it in your veins
That's where the trouble started
I fucked a lot of friends
I fucked a lot of friends
Got a black line drawn right across my name
Before the soul dies
Before the sun burns out
I want to walk through heaven's gate
I want to walk through heaven's gate
Well I moved on over to Georgia
Where the people're so nice you gotta watch where you step
Lookin' for toes and feelings
Kicking and screaming, I said my sheets stay soaking wet
The sun looks like the sun again
I got me a woman who does just a little wrong
I'm through with addiction and heartache
I'm through with it
I'm through with it
Lord, now I'm sayin' so long
Yeah I made a valid attempt
But I can't change my spots
I lost everything again
I've lost everything I got, yeah yeah
And now my body dies
And the sun burns out
I'm gonna walk through heaven's gate
I'm gonna walk through heaven's gateEmbed
