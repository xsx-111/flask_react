Women Without Whiskey LyricsIf I make it through this year
I think I'm gonna put this bottle down
I guess as time goes on, I'll grow
To miss it less than I will now
And I think I'm gonna tell her
That I'm gonna go away for a while
'Til I can get this demon out
I know the bottle ain't to blame
And I ain't trying to
'Cause it don't make you do a thing
It just lets you
And when I'm six feet underground
I'll need a drink or two
And I'll sure miss you
Take me piece by piece
'Til there ain't nothing left
Worth taking away from me
The highway's humming in my head
And it's all I hear
Could you read my lips if I pulled you near enough?
Could you read my fortune
In the bottom of this coffee cup?
Can you tell me how to tell
When I've had enough?
If morning's a bitch with open arms
Then night's a girl who's gone too far
Whiskey's harder to keep
Than a woman, and it's
Half as sweet
But women without whiskey
Women without whiskey
Whiskey's hard to beat
Whiskey's hard to beatEmbed
