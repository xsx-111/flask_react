Wallace LyricsThrow another log on the fire, boys, George Wallace is coming to stay
When he met St. Peter at the pearly gates, I'd like to think that a black man stood in the way
I know "All should be forgiven", but he did what he done so well
So throw another log on the fire boys
George Wallace is a coming
Now, he said he was the best friend a black man from Alabama ever had
And I have to admit, compared to Fob James, George Wallace don't seem that bad
And if it's true that he wasn't a racist and he just did all them things for the votes
I guess Hell's just the place for "kiss ass politicians" who pander to assholes
So throw another log on the fire, boys, George Wallace is coming to stay
I know, in the end, he got the black people's votes, but I bet they'd still vote him this way
And Hell's just a little bit hotter cause He played his hand so well
He had what it took to take it so far
Now the Devil's got a Wallace sticker on the back of his Cadillac
Oh Alabama (3x)1Embed
