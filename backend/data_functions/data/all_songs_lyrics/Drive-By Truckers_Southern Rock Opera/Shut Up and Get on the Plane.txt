Shut Up and Get on the Plane Lyrics
Well your wishings and your feelings
Your bad dreams and intuitions
Are about as much use to me right now as a brand new set of golf clubs
We've been this close to death before
But we were just too drunk to know it
Guess the price of being sober is being scared out of your mind

When it comes your time to go, ain't no good way to go about it
Ain't no use in thinking 'bout it, you'll just drive yourself insane
There comes a time for everything and the time has come for you
To shut your mouth and get your ass on the plane

There ain't nothing I'd rather do right now
Than just go on home and lay around
But that ain't never an option for a working man like me
How much is enough, you ask?
Well I'll ask the man when I get a chance
All I know right now is there's somewhere else I'm supposed to be

When it comes your time to go, ain't no good way to go about it
Ain't no use in thinking 'bout it, you'll just drive yourself insane
Comes a time for everything and the time has come for you
To shut your mouth and get your ass on the plane
Screaming engines shooting flames
Dirty needles and cheap cocaine
Some gal's old man with a gun
To me it's all the same
Dead is dead and it ain't no different
Than walking around if you ain't living
Living in fear's just another way of dying before your time

When it comes your time to go, ain't no good way to go about it
Ain't no use in thinking 'bout it, you'll just drive yourself insane
Comes a time for everything and the time has come for you
Shut your mouth and get your ass on the plane
Shut your mouth and get your ass on the planeEmbed
