Angels and Fuselage LyricsLooking out the window, the trees are getting closer it seems
Thinking bout you Darling
Adding up the cost of these dreams
Strapped to this projectile, a blink ago we were back in school
Smoking by the gym door, practicing my rock-star attitude
And I'm scared shitless of what's coming next
I'm scared shitless, these angels I see in the trees are waiting for me
The engines have stopped now. We all know we are going down. Last call for alcohol
Sure wish I could have another round
And I'm scared shitless of what's coming next
Scared shitless, these angels I see in the trees are waiting for me
Waiting for me
Friends in the swamp
Friends on the ground, in the trees
