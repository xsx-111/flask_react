Days of Graduation LyricsBobby went out for a joy ride with my best girl
Left me at the party
He was my best friend and I miss him
It was almost June, and the three-quarter moon illuminated the rain-soaked streets like a candy wrapper
I guess that's why Bobby had his lights off
Tear-assing through the back part of town and those deserted country roads where me and Bobby tear-assed so many times before
Sometimes with my best girl, and sometimes, Bobby had him one too
But this night, he banked that curve just a little too hard, and that 442 went airborne
Hit a telephone pole and split in two, Bobby's skull was split right in two
And my girl was pinned in her seat, partially embedded in the dashboard
And for the next twenty minutes, the only sound in the night were her screams
And the sound of the wheel still spinning
In a little while, the ambulance came and the sound of it's siren mixed with the sound of the screaming girl and the spinning wheel
But when the story was told the next day at the graduation ceremony
Everyone said that when the ambulance came
The paramedics could hear "Free Bird" still playing on the stereo
You know, it's a very long song...Embed
