Road Cases LyricsGot them pretty road cases
Protect our asses, protect our faces, protect our guitars, protect our amps
Got them pretty road cases throw them out an airplane and they'll just bounce
Paint our name on them road cases, stencil and white spray paint
"Drive-by Truckers" on every one or maybe just "DBT"
Gonna get ourselves a big tour bus, maybe even an airplane
Fly around the world and back
Hope it don't run out of gas
Got them pretty road cases...
Someday we'll hock our road cases, when we don't need them anymore
To pay off that big cocaine dealer (the only thing they're useful for)
One day we'll sell our road cases, when we don't need them anymore
When we outlive our usefulness
The only thing road cases are useful for
Got them pretty road casesEmbed
