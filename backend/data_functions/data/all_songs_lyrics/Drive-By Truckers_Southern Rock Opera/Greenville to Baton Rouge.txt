Greenville to Baton Rouge LyricsOne more night, one more show, four down, eighty-four to go
This ain't no time for moving slow
Greenville to Baton Rouge
I'll call you up when I get through
The life I live is the life I choose
Greenville to Baton Rouge
The shows have sure been great this year
All eight cylinders all twelve gears
Call you up when I touch down at the airport in a Louisiana town
Street Survivors, feeling no pain
A little more rock, a little less cocaine
And don't forget about Stevie Gaines
Greenville to Baton Rouge
I'll call you up when I get through
If it's the last thing that I do
Greenville to Baton Rouge
Last night, you should have seen this plane. The right engine shot a twelve foot flame
But South Carolina made us glad we came
Now we're up in the air again
Once we hit Louisiana, baby, I don't care
Got a brand new airplane waiting for us there
Give this piece of shit back to Aerosmith
Wake me up when we get there
The right engine gave a little flash, the pilot panicked and dumped the gas
Everything is quiet, we're dropping fast
When we touch down gonna whup' his ass!
Greenville to Baton Rouge
Can't die now got a show to do
The life I live is the life I choose
Greenville to Baton Rouge
(One more for the mules...)Embed
