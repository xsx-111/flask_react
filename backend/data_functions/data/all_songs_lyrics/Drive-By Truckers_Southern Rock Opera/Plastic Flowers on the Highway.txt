Plastic Flowers on the Highway LyricsHe was ready for the big trip, he was moving to the city
He had packed his prize possessions and gave away the rest
He was almost doing ninety, the sky was blue, sun was shining
All the shit, he left behind for the big world waiting there
He was almost out of Leighton, when that phone truck didn't see him
Hit the brake and slided sideways, he never had a chance
Plastic flowers on the highway. Bits of glass for the machine to sweep away
Had to pass it on my way to where I'z going
For the next few minutes, I drove a little slower
Them M.A.D.D. mothers couldn't help him
He was sober, it was Sunday
He was full of good home cooking when he crashed the savior's door
Plastic flowers on the highway. A greasy spot on the asphalt for a while
Every morning, new babies being born, who'll do the best they can to hang around a little while
My community service had me working for the county
Cutting grass on the off-ramps and medians and such
Every quarter mile or so, stands a brand new reminder
Another traffic death in town. Something new to cut around
Crashed out on the highway. Plastic cross and a plastic bouquet
Paramedics in the by-stander's gaze
Plastic flowers on the highway. Bits of glass for the machine to sweep away
Had to pass it on my way to where I'z going
For the next few minutes I drove a little slowerEmbed
