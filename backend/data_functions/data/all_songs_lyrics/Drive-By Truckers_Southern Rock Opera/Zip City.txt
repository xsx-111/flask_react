Zip City LyricsYour Daddy was mad as hell
He was mad at me and you
When he tied that chain to the front of my car and pulled me out of that ditch that I slid into
Don't know what his problem is
Why he keeps sending me away
Don't know why I put up with his shit
When you don't put out and Zip City's so far away
Your Daddy is a deacon down at the Salem Church of Christ
And he makes good money as long as Reynolds Wrap keeps everything wrapped up tight
Your Mama's as good a wife and Mama as she can be
And your sister's puttin' that sweet stuff on everybody in town but me
Your brother was the first-born, got ten fingers and ten toes
And it's a damn good thing 'cause he needs all twenty to keep the closet door closed
Maybe it's the twenty-six mile drive from Zip City to Colbert Heights
Keeps my mind clean, gets me through the night
Maybe you're just a destination, a place for me to go
Keeps me from having to deal with my seventeen-year-old mind all alone
Keep your drawers on, girl, it ain't worth the fight
By the time you drop them I'll be gone
And you'll be right where they fall the rest of your life
You say you're tired of me taking you for granted
Waiting up 'til the last minute to call you up and see what you want to do
But you're only fifteen, girl, you ain't got no secretary
And "for granted" is a mighty big word for a country girl like you
I think that's just your Daddy talking
'Cause he knows that blood red carpet at the Salem Church of Christ
Ain't gonna ever see no wedding between me and you
Zip City, it's a good thing that they built a wall around you
Zip up to Tennessee or zip right down to Alabama
I got 350 heads on a 305 engine
I get ten miles to the gallon
I ain't got no good intentionsEmbed
