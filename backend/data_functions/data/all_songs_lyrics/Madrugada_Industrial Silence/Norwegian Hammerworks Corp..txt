Norwegian Hammerworks Corp. Lyrics
Let me tell you about the way the hammer moves
The hammer goes up and down
And hits the nail, on the head each time
That's the point
I write 1998
It's getting hard to go to sleep at night
And hard to get up in the morning
I tell myself, I'm going too hard, too rash, too long, too long
But this is not the truth
There's no sign of no big break down
It's just these little things that keep putting me of the track
Yeah, I have a notion of moving around in circles
Things just keep getting worse and worse
'Till they get all the way around
And then everything turns out alright
In one single flash I see book shelfs
Computer, cigarettes, photograph, pens and pencils
Pop-craving critics curving
A doctor tried to cure me of these ills
I stopped seeing him
I heard nothing more about being mentally ill
In one single flash comes words, no poetry
Did you put on weight
I take two, not one
A man with one arm
Best beer ever to come out of Belgium
If you kept drinking like this we wouldn't have to leave
It's not like I'm real hateful with our friends, our beloved friends
VCR, last goodbyes, this is not the time for old I love you's
This nail is bent and broken, straighten it out with the hands of love
This is where the hammer hit, this is its golden tongue
There speaks no more, this is his hand that will never move
This is his arm, well, this is where the hammer hit, this is when it tore apart
This nail is bent and broken, straighten it out with the hands of love
With the hands of love, with the hands of love
With the hands of love yeah, with the hands of love yeah
With the hands of love yeah, with the hands of love
With the hands of love, with the hands of love yeah
With the hands of love, with the hands of love yeah
With the hands of love yeah, uuh shalalala with the hands of love yeah
Yeah yeah.. Yeah yeah.. Yeah yeah
Let me tell you about the way the hammer moves
The hammer goes up and down
And hits the nail, on the head each time
That's the point, yeah
This mechanism can successfully be adapted to almost everything
Things like a personality, man enters the room feels like someone just left
Pain, loss, mother to silence, guitars and tambourines
Let me tell you about the way the hammer moves
The hammer goes up and down
And hits the nail, on the head each time
That's the point
I tell myself I'm going too hard, too rash, too long
Too long
Yeah, I tell myself I'm going too hard, too rash, too long, too long
But this is not the truth
There's no sign of no big break down
It's just these little things that keep putting me of the track
Yeah, I have a notion of moving around in circles
Things just keep getting worse and worse
'Til they get all the way around
And then eveything turns out alright
In one single flash I see book shelfs
Computer, cigarettes, photograph, pens and pencils
