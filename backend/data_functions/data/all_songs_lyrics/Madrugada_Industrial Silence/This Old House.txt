This Old House LyricsHow come the stars shine so bright
Here in this night, it will not end
There's a boy and a girl
Who know all the wrong words
And you and I need no more
It's so good to be alone with you
It's so good to be open eyed
They won't know us anymore
Once we step back into
This old house
In this old house
Where every door is open
Well listen real close
This old house
In this old house
We know there's more to this than there
The nation of the two
In this old house
This old house is where we
Consider it gone and the same
Now, there were days when we would fall
Those guiding stars would shine no more
Oh it's all right with me
We just don't talk it over
Stay the rest of this day in this bed
It's so good to be alone with you
It's so good to be open eyed
And they won't know us any more
Once we step back into
Oh, this old house
In this old house
Where every door is open
We'll take it real slow
In this old house
In this old house
We know there's more to this than there
Never leave this old house
Oh, in this old house
We know there's more to this than there
Never leave
This old house
Oh, in this old house, this old
We know there's more to this than there
We'll never leave
This old houseEmbed
