Beautyproof LyricsAin't got no destination
Bit sharp on apprehension
Real hot and coming up soon
New better news presentation
Face down in raw red meat
Skinny girl watching the ugly
Thank god for the little girls
Give us the blond with the curls
Yeah
What you've got is what gets me every time
The way you piss on everything real
Show me one that you think is so virtuous and clean
And I'll show you what I mean
No boots and no direction (no hars)
No hars and no depression (if you're feeling bored turn it off)
No boring conversation (a kiss)
No need for no constellation
No need to be aroused
No lipstick, leather and chrome
Press button and insert coin
Quit now this annotation
Slip both then constellation
Constellation
What you've got is what gets me every time
The way you piss on everything real
Oh show me one that you think is so virtuous and clear
Then I'll show you show you what I meanEmbed
