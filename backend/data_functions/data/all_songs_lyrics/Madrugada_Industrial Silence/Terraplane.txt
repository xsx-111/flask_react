Terraplane LyricsLord, throw your mercy down
And burn, burn me to, to the ground
Oh, I'm gonna ride that terraplane to the ground, now
I'm gonna ride that terraplane
I'm gonna ride it to the ground
To the ground
So you send your mercy down
Oh, Oh I'm gonna fall
I'm gonna ride that terraplane
I'm gonna ride that terraplane to the ground
To the ground
Oh
I'm gonna ride that terraplane
I'm gonna ride it to the ground
I'm gonna ride that terraplane
I'm gonna ride it to the groundEmbed
