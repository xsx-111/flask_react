Sirens LyricsWell hearts belongs
Like rock and skin
At peace with evil
And all within
A shadow looms above the river
And fire sweeps across the land
Our bones are twisted in their sockets
And even we must try to stand alone
Right here alone, yeah
Fire in work beneath your skin
Forever let us sleep
'Til sirens tear the night wide open
And even we awake, love
Oh, listen
The world is awake
Oh, it's time for the tellers to rise
And the blood of the angels
Heeeey alone lone lone lone lone
Hear my ban with evil, lone
And alone
Right here alone, yeah
Alone, oh ho oh
Alone, yeah
Lone, lone, loneEmbed
