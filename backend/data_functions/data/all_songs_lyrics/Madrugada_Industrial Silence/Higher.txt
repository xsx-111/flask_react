Higher LyricsHigher, there's no need to come down
Arising through the other ground
These people, these people don't mean a thing
But don't you think it's funny
That now they get to hear me sing
All right
We'll try this
We'll try this and see if it works
I want you just like that
Just like I
Always had you
Well, if it doesn't work
Then what we need is another try
When I'm like this
It strikes me: I'm the only one that knows you
So long, when will these hands be free
Throw life into these spinning heads
Oh, higher
There's no need to come down
Arising through the other ground
This song, this song is the same as always
Anyway I wanna shape it
Such a diamond, such a holiday
So long, when will these hands be free
Throw life into these spinning heads
Go honey, be a holiday
Go honey, be a holiday
Go honey, be a holiday
Go honey, be a holidayEmbed
