Shine - 1996 Demo LyricsDid I talk in my sleep, no
Hey, did I wake to find you cry, by my side
We'll never said that it would be easy
Just that the way love grows, we have to go to
Oh well, hunny you, tonight
I'm here, tonight
Oh no, fall like a star
Oh in time, you and I, we'll shine
Oh now, hold your hand on running water
And now, wipe the black out of the blonde
Well now your head falls down on me
And your beauty is as pure as tears
Oh well, hunny you, tonight
I'm here, tonight
Oh no, fall like a star
Oh in time, you and I, we'll shine
Oh, hunny you, tonight
I'm here, tonight
I'm here, tonight
Oh no, fall like a star
Oh in time, you and I, we'll shineEmbed
