Vocal LyricsYou better run, you better run
You better not wait too long
You better run, you better run
You better run for you have a heart
So let's start, so let's start
So let's start, tear it all apart
You better run, you better run
You better run for you have a heart
Well, oh, well, oh, you know it's only so much I can take
I buried my head in that pillow for a million days
So, oh, oh well, I'm sorry but I do not care to wait
Dare not walk through the light
Dare not walk through the light
Your vision's travelled far today
So why don't you run away
Your vision's travelled far today
Like in the times when you say
I have a cry, I have a cry, and I will not be contained
I have a cry, I have a cry, and I will not be contained, no
Oh well, oh you know it is only so much I can take
Buried my head in that pillow a million days oh, oh
Oh well, I'm sorry but I do not care to wait
Oh, dare not walk through the light
Dare not walk through the light, oh
Oh, dare not walk through the light
Dare not walk through the light2Embed
