Hush Sleep Tonight - 1996 Demo LyricsHush
Sleep tonight
Stop the moon
In its flight
In your room
Wild and white
Stay awake
One last night
Leave behind
All my clothes
All I need is my father's old coat
Slipping on
Travelling shoes
Once we wake up
Nothing to lose
Oh could it be ...
A little out of breath
And could we turn this way
And never turn away
Love, please burn to the ground
Some other day
When there's no-one around
Roll my sleeve up, feel the scar
Where I carved your name
Into my arm
Oh could it be ...
A little out of breath
Oh do we waste away
On perfect, sunny days
Oh lover rain like sunlight
Into my bed of bones
Oh could we turn this way
And never turn awayEmbed
