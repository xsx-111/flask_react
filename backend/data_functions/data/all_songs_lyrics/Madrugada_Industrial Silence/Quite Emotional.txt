Quite Emotional LyricsWe're slow raised by the break of day
You are now entirely mine again
Still I hold you in my arms
There is not much to talk about anyway
Quite emotional now
Drive by noise and straight to the bone, for you
Quite emotional now, not making sense
So I come here in your arms
You keep on whispering that you won't stop
I take it back, babe
Everything that I have said
And I hold you in my arms
There's no better place for you anyway
Quite emotional now
Drifting miles apart, of reasons away
Quite emotional now, not making sense
Quite emotional now, not making sense
Quite emotional now, not making sense
So I came in your arms, your hair
Quite emotional now
Bridge:
I don't believe you nowEmbed
