Electric LyricsPack your bag
Run away
Along a freeway
Out of town
Where the land
And the mind
It's over
It's alright
From despair
Dream the sheets
Spilling over
Spinning round
Waiting still
In the street
Ain't it better
Ain't it sweet
Oh oh
Holding holding on to you again
Holding holding on to you again
Don't rush it
Don't rush it my love
Oh
Holding holding on to you
Bet you lie
On your back
In the backseat
Of his car
Cattle black
Pepper night
Dylan thomas
Passed around
Passing out
On the floor
In the bathroom
Black light veil
We don't need
Once agian
Sing their songs and drink their wine
Oh
Well how long did you stay there
Well I can believe my eyes
Well how long will I take this
Well I can hold on, no hold on
Holding holding on to you again
Holding holding on to you again
I'm ready
I'm ready my love
Holding holding on to youEmbed
