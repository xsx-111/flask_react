Strange Colour Blue LyricsBlue
Strange colour blue
Sixteen tons on the moon
Blue
Strange colour blue
Coming back to you
Pushing through
Pouring rain
Nearly there
Nearly there
Oh, blue
Blue
Strange colour blue
Sixteen tons on the moon
Hey little mister driver man
Keep your head up
We are nearly there
I am racing
Outside and below myself
Nearly forgot myself there
Nearly there, yeah
Oh, everybody's sleeping now
An industrial silence singing
And the rain will keep hammering down from overhead
Now there's a blue, blue, strange colour blue
Let me dream of me and you
Oh, how the rain keeps coming down
Pour, oh, running down the window
Like a vein on my arm
Oh, running down the window
Like a vein on my arm, yeah
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
Nearly there
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
Nearly there
Oh, blue
Strange colour, a colour blue
Yeah, a colour blue
Oh, blue blue blue yeah
Strange colour, a colour blue
Yeah, a colour blue
Oh, blue blue blue, yeah
Strange colour, a colour blue
Oh, a colour blue
Hey little mister driver man
Keep your head up
We are nearly there
Nearly thereEmbed
