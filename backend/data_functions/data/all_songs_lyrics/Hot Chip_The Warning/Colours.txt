Colours LyricsColours are what
Keep me alive
Colours are what
To hold in my head
Colours are where my
My old meets new
Colours are where my
My brain finds blue
Colours and colours and colours of colours
Colours and colours and colours of colours
Colours and colours and colours of colours
Colours and colours and colours of colours
Colours and colours and colours of colours
Bursts are where
I find a face
Bursts are made
To colour me rich
Bursts are blocks
Stickle bricks
Bursts of colour
Until I'm sick
Colours and colours and colours of colours
(I only wanted for to see)
Colours and colours and colours of colours
(There's nothing in this heart but me)
Colours and colours and colours of colours
(Everything you want is not free)
Colours and colours and colours of colours
Colours and colours and colours of colours
(I'm everything a girl could need)
Colours and colours and colours of colours
(There's nothing in this heart but me)
Colours and colours and colours of colours
(If everything you want is free)Embed
