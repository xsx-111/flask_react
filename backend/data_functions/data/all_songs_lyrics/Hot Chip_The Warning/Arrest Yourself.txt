Arrest Yourself LyricsI do my best to dehydrate me but I think you'll forsake me
When I'm deep inside and make me like I'm locked in a lake
I do my best to rehydrate you at the risk of absurdity
There's nothing left between us but a state of emergency
Arrest yourself
If there's wonky in my diction then I think it's affliction
If there's fact I've lost my fiction then I think it's affected
If it's loose around your neck you'd take it only with affection
If you feel it coming on then go get away defeated
Arrest yourself
Don't make it hard for me go suffer yourselfEmbed
