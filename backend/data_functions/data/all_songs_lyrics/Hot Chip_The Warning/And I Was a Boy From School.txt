And I Was a Boy From School Lyrics
And I was a boy from school
Helplessly helping all the rules
And there was a boy at school
Hopelessly wrestling all his fools
And there was a girl at school
Blaming all the words she learned from home
Nothing could keep her a child
Long hours, don't you know we tried?

We tried, but we didn't have long
We tried, but we don't belong
We tried, but we didn't have long
We tried, but we don't belong

Now I met you on the street
Heartlessly breaking rules, we meet
Lives are found and loves are lost
Say goodbye to nothing everything caused
Now I find you on the street
Breaking rules, hopelessly we meet
Lives are found but loves are lost
Say goodbye to everything, nothing caused
We tried, but we didn't have long
We tried, but we don't belong
We tried, but we didn't have long
We tried, but we don't belong

I got, I got lost
(You said this was the way back)
I got, I got lost
(You said this was the way back)
I got, I got lost
(You said this was the way back)

We tried, but we didn't have long
We tried, but we don't belong
We tried, but we didn't have long
We tried, but we don't belong3Embed
