(Just Like We) Breakdown LyricsCome around and around just like we breakdown
With a fist and a fall we meet with the floor
On the ropes in the hope of making once more
All in the name of what we're not sure
Come around and around just like we breakdown
With a fist and a fall we meet with the floor
On the ropes in the hope of making once more
All in the name of what we're not sure
Lay down in our beds, it's caught in our heads
There's a room full of notes that build to a dread
Is there room to ignore what we are here for
Turn on the lights and open the door
Ring on your finger, a block on your heart
Hold on my friend, an end is the start
Ring on your finger, a block on your heart
Hold on my friend, an end is the start
Come around and around just like we breakdown
With a fist and a fall we meet with the floor
On the ropes in the hope of making once more
All in the name of what we're not sure
Ring on your finger, a block on your heart
Hold on my friend, an end is the start
Ring on your finger, a block on your heart
Hold on my friend, an end is the startEmbed
