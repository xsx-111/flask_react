Tchaparian LyricsI'm looking for a face to attack
It could be that I'm kissing your kneck
You will not know because I'm laid back
So watch yourself I'll come with a smack
I've hit you hard it's time for some bounce
I've left a scar there's blood in our dance
I rock the club straphobia stance
Now fix yourself your heart's in my lungs
Sip on something sleepy why not get a little overdose
Sip on something sleepy why not get a little overdose
Sip on something sleepy why not get a little overdose
Sip on something sleepy why not get a little overdose

What can you find in parade
What can you find a rave
What can be drunk in a dream
What can be dreampt in a dream
It's all a tech it's all a tongue talk
I'll spell it out just pass me the chalk
If I could teach you soon would be taught
We're looking for something to report
