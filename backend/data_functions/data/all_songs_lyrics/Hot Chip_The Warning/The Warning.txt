The Warning Lyrics
Excuse me, sir, I'm lost
I'm looking for a place where I can get lost
I'm looking for a home for my malfunctioning being
I'm looking for the mechanical music museum

This is a warning, I'll spell it out for you
For you
This is a warning, I'll spell it out for you

Excuse me, miss, I'm a dog on heat
I'm a complicated being with love songs to beat
I'm a poor, starving baby who can march all night
I'm a mechanical music man and I'm starting a fight

Hot Chip will break your legs
Snap off your head
Hot Chip will put you down
Under the ground

Excuse me, child, I am trying to see
All the colours of wonder your brightness can be
Return to nothingness, enjoy just might be right
But prepare yourself for a mechanical fright
This is a warning, I'll spell it out for you
For you
This is a warning, I'll spell it out for you
For you

Hot Chip will break your legs
Snap off your head
Hot Chip will put you down
Under the ground
Hot Chip will break your legs
Snap off your head
Hot Chip will put you down
Under the ground

Excuse me, son, I'm found
I'm looking for a place where I was once found
There's nothing in a world where the melody is broken
There's always some way to make a silence be spoken

Hot Chip will break your legs
Snap off your head
Hot Chip will put you down
Under the ground
Hot Chip will break your legs
Snap off your head
Hot Chip will put you down
Under the ground3Embed
