Look After Me LyricsLook after me and I will look after you
That's something we both forgot to do
Look after me and I will look after you
That's something we both forgot to do
I find it hard to see your face, day to day
Cannot remember it well enough, only the details and such, then I see it in my head
When I am with you it's familiar and beautiful, and I love it as I love you
As night comes in I know it better, seeing it clear again
Look after me and I will look after you
That's something we both forgot to do
Look after me and I will look after you
That's something we both forgot to do
As if I'm squinting I see you are so  far from me, far from me
As if by miracle I see the room I see a screen
With words and music these images they come back to me, back to me
Crystal clear in my head, but it's behind the screen
Look after me and I will look after you
That's something we both forgot to do
Look after me and I will look after you
That's something we both forgot to do
Look after me and I will look after you
That's something we both forgot to do
Every time I see your face I break down and cry
I see it in your family as they walk on by
Come back to me and I'll come back to you
That's something we don't always do
Come back to me and I'll come back to you
That's something we don't always doEmbed
