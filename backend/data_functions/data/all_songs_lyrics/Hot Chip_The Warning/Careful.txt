Careful Lyrics
Every year, exactly this time of year
They go up, balloon up into the air
And hold onto one who is near
Remember everything is here

Every year about this time of year
I am with you as if you are here
I remember the way it fell through
You and all we all could do

I hope that you will be careful
The stories you told are hopeful
I hope that they aren't just artful
I hope that you will be carefulEmbed
