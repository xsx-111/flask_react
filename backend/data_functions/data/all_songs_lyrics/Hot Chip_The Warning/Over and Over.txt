Over and Over Lyrics
Laid back
Laid back
Laid back, we'll give you laid back
Laid back
Laid back
Laid back, I'll give you laid back

Over and over and over and over and over
Like a monkey with a miniature cymbal
The joy of repetition really is in you
Under and under and under and under and under
The smell of repetition really is on you
And when I feel this way, I really am with you

Laid back
Laid back
Laid back, I'll give you laid back

Over and over and over and over and over
Like a monkey with a miniature cymbal
The joy of repetition really is in you
Under and under and under and under and under
The smell of repetition really is on you
And when you look this way, I really am with you

I started thinking I knew what I had to do (Tell you)
I got you thinking that I knew just what to do (Tell you)
I started thinking I knew what I had to do to (Tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you)
I started thinking I knew I what I have to do (Tell you)
I got you thinking that I mean just what you do (Tell you)
I started thinking I knew what I had to do to (Tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you)

Over and over and over and over and over
Like a monkey with a miniature cymbal
The joy of repetition really is in you
Under and under and under and under and under
The smell of repetition really is on you
And when you look this way, I really am with you
