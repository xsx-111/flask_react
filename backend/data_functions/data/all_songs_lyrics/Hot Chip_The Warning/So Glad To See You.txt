So Glad To See You LyricsSo glad to see that you came
Like all birds together we will squawk and we squeak
The joy comes from all our beaks
And ringing bells is our fun
Now our ass is moving as one
If we are forgetting all the rules that we learnt
As all the rule books are burnt
And just as A follows B
Our chorus must always be
So glad to see that you came
We had best times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home
I have but one true friend
She sings to me in my solitude
And I know her name
I tried to know her, in all her changes
And I don't know her place
And I don't see her face
When we come together then we forget ourselves
And just as night follows day
The beginning must become the end
And so we will start again
When we come together then we meet other souls
And then we make our goodbye
And we lay our bones to rest
As birds we dream of the sky
Please let me go
Please help me go
So glad to see that you came
We had nice times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home
We had best times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home
I have but one true friend
She sings to me in my solitude
And I know her name
I tried to know her, in all her changes
And I don't know her place
And I don't see her face
When we come together then we forget ourselves
And just as night follows day
The beginning must become the end
And so we will start again
When we come together then we meet other souls
And then we make our goodbye
And we lay our bones to rest
As birds we dream of the sky
Please let me go
Please help me go
So glad to see that you came
We had nice times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go homeEmbed
