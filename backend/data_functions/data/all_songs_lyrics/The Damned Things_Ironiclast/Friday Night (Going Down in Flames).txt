Friday Night (Going Down in Flames) Lyrics
Write a note and keep the car running
Hide the evidence in front of their eyes
The heat of passion
In the sweat we're baptized
Don't ask if I know what I'm doing
Cause I don't, no I don't
But if I have to, I'll do it on my own

And if you look for rhyme or reason
Your head will spin cause

All I want is another good time
It's Friday night
And Sunday's saints have gone away
They're out of sight
Cause all I want is another good time
It's Friday night
And if we're all going down in flames
I think the devil just called my name

Cross the world in search of balance
The white whale keeps eluding me
We've got our hooks in
Now we're dragged by our feet
Don't ask if I know where it's going
Cause I don't, no I don't
But where I end up is where I'll rest my bones
And if you look for rhyme or reason
Your head will spin cause

All I want is another good time
It's Friday night
And Sunday's saints have gone away
They're out of sight
Cause all I want is another good time
It's Friday night
And if we're all going down in flames
I think the devil just called my name

My mind is racing
The room's in a spin
And I'm tired of knockin'
So just let me in
You know where I'm headin'
And I know where you've been
But that ain't gonna stop us from giving in

And if you look for rhyme or reason
Your head will spin cause
All I want is another good time
It's Friday night
And Sunday's saints have gone away
They're out of sight
Cause all I want is another good time
It's Friday night
And if we're all going down in flames
I think the devil just called my name
All I want is another good time
It's Friday night
So let my demons draw the line
Just stay on your side
All I want is another good time
It's Friday night
And if we're all going down in flames
I think the devil just called my nameEmbed
