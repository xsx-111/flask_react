Little Darling Lyrics
C'mon, c'mon, little darling
Put on your favorite shoes
C'mon, c'mon, little darling
I'm gonna give you the blues

I'll make sure to keep a light on
To draw you in
Like a flame you're burnin' up, darling
To go out again

Quiet down, baby
You're not listening to what I say
(We're all the way, we're all the way)
Dry your eyes, honey
Let the broken record play
(We're all the way, we're all the way)
Quiet down, baby
You're not listening to what I say
(We're all the way, we're all the way)
Little darling gotta save my soul

C'mon get loud, little darling
You've got a lot to prove
C'mon get high, little darling
Hearts gonna beat 'til they bruise
I don't mean to keep you waiting
And wondering
Like a wave I'm rolling in, darling
To go out again

Quiet down, baby
You're not listening to what I say
(We're all the way, we're all the way)
Dry your eyes, honey
Let the broken record play
(We're all the way, we're all the way)
Quiet down, baby
You're not listening to what I say
(We're all the way, we're all the way)
Little darling gotta save my soul

I come and go, but never disappear
A million miles until we're in the clear
I come and go, but never disappear
I keep running back to you, little darling

Little darling gotta save my soul
Little darling gotta save my soul
Little darling gotta save my soulEmbed
