A Great Reckoning Lyrics
I'll let the coin toss figure it out
If that's alright
I can't be bothered with affairs of the heart
When I'm trying to ruin my life
Place your money down to beat the spread
You give me more credit than you should ever invest
And if it's bad luck that suits us
Then I'm one of a kind

The king gets his aces cracked
My good name's no good anymore
Awareness is leaving me
But I don't miss it, I don't know
I'm not wanted, I reckon
I reckon, I reckon

It's not necessity that kept you around
Of that I'm sure
Unless you need to keep falling apart
Then I'm your safest bet
We've been counting cards, trying to win
I lost more dignity then I had to spend
And if it's bad luck that suits us
Then I'm one of a kind

You can't take me anywhere
My good name's no good anymore
The king gets his aces cracked
And I don't miss it, I don't know
I'm not wanted, I reckon
I reckon, I reckon

You can't take me anywhere
My good name's no good anymore
The king gets his aces cracked
And I don't miss it, I don't know
I'm not wanted, I reckon
I reckon, I reckon
Tonight I am ending the world 
Every night I am ending the world
This is my great reckoningEmbed
