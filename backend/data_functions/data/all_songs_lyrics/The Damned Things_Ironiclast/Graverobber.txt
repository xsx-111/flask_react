Graverobber LyricsI got caught dragging the scraps from the heap by the junkyard dogs
They won't leave me alone, no
'Cause I went for the pearl they keep in the mouth of the pig
But he won't let it go, no he won't let it go
So I broke the lock to the vault where they buried my child
But he won't stay alive, no he can't be revived
Don't push me, I said I was leaving
I just wanted to stick my hands up the shirts of the grieving
Graverobber, you can't take me home
I don't care what nobody says, lord
That's my bed on the side of the road
Graverobber, your hands are getting cold
We take another drink of the dust that don't just blow
It pours straight from the veins of the ghost of our lord
And it won't be long until my cask is a casket
And I've righted all my wrongs
Graverobber, you can't take me home
I don't care what nobody says, lord
That's my bed on the side of the road
Graverobber, your hands are getting cold
I lost what I've found in the feedback and chemicals
We're growing mold on the fruits of our labours
I lost what I've found in the feedback and chemicals
We're growing mold on the fruits of our labours
I go back to the well
With my head in my hands
And my tail between my legs
I go back to the well
With my head in my hands
And my tail between my legs
Graverobber, you can't take me home
I don't care what nobody says, lord
That's my bed on the side of the road
Graverobber, your hands are getting coldEmbed
