Handbook for the Recently Deceased Lyrics
We're breaking up, getting lost in the static
You're getting blurry right in front of me
The footsteps growing quiet in the hallway
As I let go, let go
The gravity that attracts us helps us implode
Or else we'd keep dividing
But I know, I know

We're aimed straight at each other
We are doomed to crash
So strike up a fire, light up the town
'Cause we're aimed straight at each other
This was meant to last
So don't try to fight it, the chaos will calm us down

Our lips move but we speak in a language
That neither one of us can understand
You sleepwalk through the tape and the sirens
I let go, let go
The rules of our attraction were carved in stone
And yet you keep resisting
But I know, I know

It doesn't matter, it's a disaster
It doesn't matter
The chaos will calm us down
