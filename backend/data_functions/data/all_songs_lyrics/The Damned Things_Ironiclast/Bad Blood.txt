Bad Blood Lyrics
You couldn't tell it by the tone that I want you?
You couldn't guess from the vibe that you're mine?
Shot glasses, burnt out cigarettes
You wanted nothing, baby, get in line
I couldn't stay but I thought you'd be waiting
Holding your breath while I wore out the crown
Clock freezes, no change in scenery
I closed my eyes and you opened the ground

So I watch and I wait and I pace
You gave me rope so I'm hanging around
Bad blood
Is maybe what we need tonight in our veins
Bad blood
We're dancing on the edge of the knife
Can you feel it?
Tonight we bring our bodies to life 
I come crawling back through the cracks in your windows
I'm seeping into your skin through the walls
Grand delusions of petty criminals
If I'm not everything I'm nothing at all


Bad blood
Is maybe what we need tonight in our veins
Bad blood
I'm crashing right in front of your eyes
Can you feel it?
Tonight we bring our bodies to life 
Where was I when you thought I crossed the line?
Where was I when the gears began to grind?
Where was I while the band kept playing on?
Where was I when you knew I was wrong?

Bad blood
Is maybe what we need tonight in our veins
Bad blood
I'm crashing right in front of your eyes
Can you feel it?
Tonight we bring our bodies to life 
So, come on, baby, get in line
Tonight we bring our bodies to lifeEmbed
