Coming Back to a Man LyricsYou still wear your hair to your shoulder
You still look like a Friday night
You're still caught somewhere between the plans and the dreams
So that neither end up turning out right
And I myself look a few moments older
When I learned that love is not as simple as I thought
It starts to feel more real and the wounds all start to heal
Whether I want them to or not
So tell me why you think I should forgive what you did
And ill tell you if I understand
Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid
And you're now coming back to a man
It means a lot that you came here to speak to me
And I will listen in a way I never could before
I'll catch the pause between each word and when your presentation's heard
Then I'll need to show you to the door
Cause some people were just meant to be a memory
To be called upon to remind us how we've changed
The way the scattered ever-busy bright lights of a city
Might look off to a distant mountain range
And the guy you know is someone I work hard at keeping hid
And he is very good at sticking to the plan
Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid
And you're now coming back to a man
I might think of you more often than I'm willing to admit
But I can't show every card I'm holding in my hand
Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid
And you're now coming back to a man
You still wear your hair to your shoulder
You still look like a Friday night
You're still caught somewhere between the plans and the dreams
So that neither end up turning out rightEmbed
