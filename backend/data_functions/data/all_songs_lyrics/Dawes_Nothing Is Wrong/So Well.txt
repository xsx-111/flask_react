So Well LyricsI am an old old sailor
With a future much shorter than his past
I live alone, I do not wander
A world that just slips further from my grasp
And from my home I watch the people
Struggle through the burden of each day
That's where Marie sweet and gentle
Smiles to me when she passes on her way
And she does it so well
She pulls me out of times cruel spell
For long enough to finally tell
That nothing is wrong
I am a boy, I am a child
With those simple dreams still burning in my heart
I've known Marie for a while
She shows me where all my beginnings are
And once a week she takes me dancing
She shows me friends and places I never knew
And it always ends watching her leaving
With men she knows that don't understand what loneliness will make you do
And she does it so well
She shows me where my dreams dwell
She shows me how to find myself
And that nothing is wrong
I am a lonely singer
With a song for every feeling I cannot name
And I find Marie in every measure
And somehow the clearer she becomes the longer I'm away
And she does it so well
I was still falling in love when she said farewell
For long enough to finally tell
That nothing is wrong that nothing is wrongEmbed
