Time Spent in Los Angeles Lyrics
These days my friends don't seem to know me
Without my suitcase in my hand
And when I'm standing still
I seem to disappear
But maybe that's how I found you
Maybe that's taught me exactly what I want
Maybe meeting you so far away from home
Is what makes it all so clear

But you got that special kind of sadness
You got that tragic set of charms
That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles
Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms

When people ask me where I come from
To see what that says about man
I only end up giving bad directions
That never lead them there at all
It's something written in the head lights
It's something swimming in my drink
And if I were the moon
It would be exactly where I fall
Cause you got that special kind of sadness
You got that tragic set of charms
That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles
Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms


I used to think someone would love me
For the places I have been
And the dirt I have been gathering
Deep beneath my nails
But now I know what I've been missing
And I'm going home to make it mine
And I'll be battening the hatches and pulling in the sails

'Cause you got that special kind of sadness
You got that tragic set of charms
That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles
Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms
Cause you got that special kind of sadness
You got that tragic set of charms
That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles
Makes me wanna wrap you in my armsEmbed
