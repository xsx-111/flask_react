If I Wanted Someone Lyrics
Like the memory from your mother's house
From before you got too old
Like the feeling from a photograph
Before its meanings all got told
The words I say can be silver
But what's left unsaid can be gold
So get to know me once I go away

Maybe 'cause I come from such an empty-hearted town
Or maybe 'cause some love of mine had really let me down
But, the only times I am lonely is when others are around
I just never end up knowing what to say

If I wanted someone to clean me up
I'd find myself a maid
If I wanted someone to spend my money
I wouldn't need to get paid
If I wanted someone to understand me
I'd have so much more to say
I want you to make the days move easy

I took everything I thought
From what it means to be a man
We need words to be put
To what we do not understand
While you lean into the echoes
And you do not raise a hand
Oh woman, help me see it like it is
If I wanted someone to clean me up
I'd find myself a maid
If I wanted someone to spend my money
I wouldn't need to get paid
If I wanted someone to understand me
I'd have so much more to say
I want you to make the days move easy
If I wanted someone to clean me up
I'd find myself a maid
If I wanted someone to spend my money
I wouldn't need to get paid
If I wanted someone to understand me
I'd have so much more to say
I want you to make the days move easy

If I wanted someone to clean me up
I'd find myself a maid
If I wanted someone to spend my money
I wouldn't need to get paid
If I wanted someone to cut me down
I'd have handed you the blade
I want you to make the days move easy
I just want you to make the days move easy4Embed
