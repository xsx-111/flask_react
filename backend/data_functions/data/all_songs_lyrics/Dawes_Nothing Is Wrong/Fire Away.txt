Fire Away LyricsThis one's going out to you
As the taxi pulls away
A song to keep you company for the ride
There's something wrong with a goodbye
In the middle of a day
So pretend I am still sitting at your side
And if you want to talk about the differences
Between the shackle and the man
Or if you've got reasons no one ever let you say
Then fire away
Fire away
This one's going out to you
On the day they let you out
For the thousand ways they ask if you're okay
Because whatever answer that you give
It's only gonna play into their doubts
And be just half of what's behind each word you say
So if you finally wrote that heartbreak song
That the experts never could
Or if you just wanted someone to listen to you play
Then fire away (hey)
Fire away (hey-ey)
This one's going out to you
If you ever start to slip
And you learn to read between these lines you've drawn
When what is wrong and what is right
Seem more like just the ocean and the ship
And the straight line that you've followed here is gone
And if that same old fox comes and sweeps you up
Each time you spread your wings
I could at least love you through each stumble, shift and sway
So fire away (hey-ey)
Fire away (hey-ey)
Fire away-ay
When you need someone to walk away from
When you need someone to let you in
When you need someone to walk away from
When you need someone to let you in
(Through each stumble, shift and sway)
When you need someone to walk away from
(Through each stumble, shift and sway)
When you need someone to let you in
(Through each stumble, shift and sway)
When you need someone to walk away from
(Through each stumble, shift and sway)
When you need someone to let you in
(Through each stumble, shift and sway)
When you need someone to walk away from
When you need someone to let you inEmbed
