Marilyn Lyrics
I'm looking up at you, yeah
Are you looking up at me, yeah?
Our teeths shining
Teeths are shining, yeah

Now I know, I know, I know I do
Even if it looks like I thought this through
We could drive into the sea
I saw you looking up at me, yeah

Now I know, I know, I know I do
Even if it looks like I thought this through
We could drive into the sea
I saw you looking up at me, yeah

Are you looking up at me, yeah?
I'm looking up at you, yeah
I'm looking up at you, yeah
Are you looking up at me, yeah?

I've got nothing on
So, what are you thinking?
I'm looking up at you, yeah
Are you looking up at me, yeah?1Embed
