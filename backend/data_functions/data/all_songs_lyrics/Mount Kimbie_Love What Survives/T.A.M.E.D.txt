T.A.M.E.D Lyrics

Think about me every day
I'm alone forever
Think about me every day
I'm alone forever

Think about me every day
I'm alone forever
Think about me every day
I'm alone forever

Think about me every day
I'm alone forever
Think about me every day
I'm alone forever

Dark cloud, that came as some surprise
Here now, so take your own advice
Eat alone and care about, we really should
But my, my, my, you made me so unkind
Dark cloud, that came as some surprise
Here now, so take your own advice
Eat alone and care about, we really should
But my, my, my, you made me so unkind

Dark cloud, that came as some surprise
Here now, so take your own advice
Eat alone and care about, we really should
But my, my, my, you made me so unkind

Think about me every day
I'm alone forever
Think about me every day
I'm alone forever

Think about me every day
I'm alone forever
Think about me every day
I'm alone forever1Embed
