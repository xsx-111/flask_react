How We Got By Lyrics
Blocking out the thought is how we get by
When we get it wrong
Blocking out the thought is how we get by
When we get it wrong
Blocking out the thought is how we get by
When we get it wrong
Blocking out the thought is how we get by
When we get it wrong

Blocking out thought
Blocking out thought

When I get it wrong, when I really get it wrong
When I get it wrong I really get it wrong
When I get it wrong I really get it wrong
When I stall I really stall
When I stall I really stall
When I stall I really stall

In a triumph stag and I'm nowhere near the track
Holding onto the road like it's my last day
Teach me like it's your last day
Like it's your last day too
Teach me like you would have me do for you
Blocking out thought
