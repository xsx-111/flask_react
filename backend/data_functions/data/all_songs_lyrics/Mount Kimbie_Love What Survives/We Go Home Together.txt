We Go Home Together Lyrics
Cold like money, other arms reach out for me
So stunning, the wood for the trees
Other eyes smile tenderly
Saturday pouring, ice is clattering
Hanging off the ceiling
Grip on this feeling
Then we leave at your word
At your word, at your word

And it's the best it could've been
We go home together
To our innermost
We go home together
And then we leave
And it's the best it could've been
We go home together1Embed
