Fly Away LyricsIt's hard to tell you why
You'll have to wait and see
Your wings will grow
And then you'll know
The joy of being free
To float upon the air
And drift along the breeze
You'll greet a friend
Then rise again
So high above the trees
And I can show you how
But you'll have to make your own way
Patience now
Tomorrow you can fly away
Heartbreakers all
When you arrive at the Ball
Oh how you sway
You're going to steal hearts away
I know it's not so bad
For I was once like you
Enjoy yourself
There's nothing else
That you can say or do
And most of all be calm
Be beautiful and shy
Your time will come
And like the sun
You'll reach up to the sky
And I can show you how
But you'll have to make your own way
Patience now
Tomorrow you can fly awayEmbed
