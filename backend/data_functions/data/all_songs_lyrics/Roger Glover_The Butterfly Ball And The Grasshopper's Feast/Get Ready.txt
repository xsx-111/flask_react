Get Ready LyricsWake up, wake up
It's time to get up
The sun is shining
Now's the day we've all been waiting for
Hurry, hurry
Don't be lazy
Stop your dreaming
Here's a dream come true that you can keep for evermore
Get ready
Get ready
Get ready now
Bats and badgers
Gnats and gadflies
Waterboat men
Wake up for the greatest day of all
Ants and dormice
Open your eyes
Mobilize now
Get yourselves together for the feast and for the ball
Get ready
Get ready
Get ready nowEmbed
