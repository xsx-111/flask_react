Sir Maximus Mouse LyricsHe sits in seclusion
Will take no intrusion into his world
They all bow their faces
From men in high places to the office girl
He's Sir Maximus Mouse
And he lives in a house bought with pieces of paper
If a deal's up for grabs
Or there's cash to be had he's the taker
He's facing a crisis
A drop in cheese prices force him to sell
Playing with other lives
He makes sure that he survives, they can go to Hell
He's Sir Maximus Mouse
And he lives in a house that he bought from the Devil
If they question his shares
Then his books will show they're on the level
With luxury living
His charity giving is a clever scheme
Enormous donations
Help public relations foster the dream
He's Sir Maximus Mouse
And he lives in a house that could pass for a palace
Like a fortress in which
Like a demon or witch he can vanishEmbed
