No Solution LyricsDon't start complaining now
The damage is done and you know how
Don't make a fuss you're not so bad
If you don't want to look so sad
Don't drink the water
It's bad for you
Don't drink the water
It's sad for you can't drink it anymore
I don't mind if you don't care
About your house or what you wear
But these times affect us all
Whether you hop or fly or crawl
Don't drink the water
It's bad for you
Don't drink the water
It's sad for you can't drink it anymore
(No solution)
There's a way to make it clean
It doesn't have to be a dream
What was once can be again
I know how but I don't know when
Don't drink the water
It's bad for you
Don't drink the water
It's sad for you can't drink it anymore
