Watch Out for the Bat LyricsWatch out for the Bat now
Or that'll be that now
The price you will pay is dear
So don't be ashamed to fear
That is what makes you care
Makes you beware
Don't worry about it
You'll find you're without it
The Bat's going to take your life
He's going to take your wife
The Bat's going to make you plead
Make you bleed
So make no mistake there
You'll end up as steak (rare)
Always be on your guard
For this life is hard
Death is a breath away
Every dayEmbed
