Harlequin Hare LyricsI'm harlequin hare
I haven't got a care
I'm going to the ball
Bang on your drum
Tell everyone come
Come all
And part of my style
Is making you all smile
There's Nathaniel Gnat
In his cavalier hat
And a twinkle in his eye
By the light of the moon
The ladies all swoon
And sigh
And part of his style
Is making them all smile
Grasshopper goes
Wherever his nose
Will tell him to go
Fancy and free
And letting his fee-
Lings show
And oh what a sight
He'll be at the ball tonightEmbed
