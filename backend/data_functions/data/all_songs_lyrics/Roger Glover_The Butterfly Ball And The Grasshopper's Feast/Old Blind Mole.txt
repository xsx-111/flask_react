Old Blind Mole LyricsOld Blind Mole
It's home sweet home down in his hole
Old Blind Mole
He don't need me or you
Old Blind Mole
He don't need gasoline or coal
Old Blind Mole
He don't need me or you
Self contained
Always been the same
Obeys no rule
Nobody's fool (he's so cool)
Old Blind Mole
He never robbed and he never stole
Old Blind Mole
He don't need me or youEmbed
