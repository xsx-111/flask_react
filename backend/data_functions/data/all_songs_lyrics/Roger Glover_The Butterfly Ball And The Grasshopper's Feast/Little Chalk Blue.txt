Little Chalk Blue LyricsThere's no one here that feels no pain
Deep inside we're all the same
And when the light begins to end
We meet a friend
Some people symbolize
The hope and fears beyond our eyes
And now you shine so clear and true
Believe in you
Fly on, little chalk blue
Fly on, I'm following you
And everybody in the world
Is following too, fly on
When you're looked behind a door
You need your freedom there much more
And by your wings we'll learn to see
You hold the key
Fly on, little chalk blue
Fly on, I'm following you
And everybody in the world
Is following too
Following you, fly onEmbed
