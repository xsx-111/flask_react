Behind the Smile LyricsBehind the smile the stranger lies
Beware of what is in his eyes
Looks like fun but he's after you
It's not so funny what that smile can do...
Behind the smile there lies a face
Filled with cunning, but he's full of grace
Comes on friendly but is deadly too
Beware or he'll take care of you...
An innocence so well rehearsed
And so na√Øve
That's all you ever see
Behind the smile you cannot see
Lies another full of mystery
Don't be fooled by that friendly grin
The jaws of death are going to call you in...Embed
