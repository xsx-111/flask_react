Sitting in a Dream LyricsI'm just passing time before the ball
Playing my guitar
I don't have to be where I don't want to be at all
Maybe I'll go far
Going nowhere
Sitting in a dream
Ah in a dream
Sitting in a landscape full of sighs
Dream away the day
Making up a tune about the blueness of the skies
This is where I'll stay
Going nowhere
Sitting in a dream
Ooh in a dream
Watching as a red and white balloon
Sails across my mind
In between the images that drift along my tune
Smile as they unwind
Going nowhere
Sitting in a dream
Ah in a dreamEmbed
