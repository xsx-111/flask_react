Together Again LyricsI can't recall
If there's a ball
Should we be there?
It seems to me
We ought to be
With someone somewhere
Give us another
Oh pardon me, brother
For laughing
It's good to be back together again
The candle dims
My vision swims
Too much cheer
The feeling's good
But I know that I should
Be going from here
Give us another
Say, hey, brother
Where are you going without me?
I'm glad that we are together againEmbed
