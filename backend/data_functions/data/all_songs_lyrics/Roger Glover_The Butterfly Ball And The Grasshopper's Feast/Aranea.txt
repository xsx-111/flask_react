Aranea LyricsOh Aranea, you're so divine
It's hard to take my eyes off you
You really shine
Oh Aranea, you seem so wise
And every time I look into
Your spider eyes
My hopeful heart just flies
Time is flying too
So brush your hair and lace your shoe
You know the ball won't wait for you
Tonight
Oh Aranea, you're proud and tall
When you descend on silken threads
Down to the Ball
You'll look the best of allEmbed
