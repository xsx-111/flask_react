Saffron Dormouse and Lizzy Bee LyricsSaffron Dormouse:
Pots and pans all spick and span
Hanging there in a tidy row
Careful Tom don't scuff up the floor
Please don't make me scrub it again today
We're on our way to the ball
Lizzy Bee:
All day long I'm working like a slave
But you'll never hear me complain
In the sunshine or the rain
Saffron Dormouse:
I've been asleep all winter
And now the spring is here
It's time for you to hear my song
Lizzy Bee:
(Hope it's not too long)
Saffron Dormouse:
Every room is clean and bright
Now we'd better be on our way
Tom make sure you've got everything
Lock the door and give me the key
Let's go to see the show at the ball
Lizzy Bee:
Back to work tomorrow, but tonight
Going to eat and dance 'till I fall
At the feast and at the ballEmbed
