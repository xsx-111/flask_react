Homeward LyricsNow the ball is over
It's time to get back home
I need a star to guide me
I'm feeling so alone
Feeling so alone
Morning mustn't find me
Sleeping in the sun
Now the dawn is breaking
A new day just begun
New day just begun
Glow worm lighting
Darkness fighting
Guiding one and all
Homeward going
Moving flowing
Homeward from the ball
Wings are sadly folding
Here comes another day
Oh, I'd like to stay forever
And dance the night away
Dance the night away
Glow worm lighting
Darkness fighting
Guiding one and all
Homeward going (Take me home)
Moving flowing
Homeward from the ball
Homeward going
Moving flowing
Homeward from the ball
Homeward going (Take me home)
Moving flowing (Take me home)
Homeward from the ball
Homeward going
Moving flowing
Homeward from the ballEmbed
