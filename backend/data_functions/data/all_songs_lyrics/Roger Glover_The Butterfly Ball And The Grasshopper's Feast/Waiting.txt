Waiting LyricsI'm waiting here for something good to come my way
And I've been waiting patiently all day
The sunshine begins to stretch across the sky
I'm just waiting, oh I am waiting
People that are restless, moving here and there
Somehow they seem to go nowhere
So I remain and watch the world go by
I'm just waiting, oh I am waiting
I don't know what I'm waiting for but that's all right
Every thing I need is in my sight
I'm free as every kingfisher should be
And I'm just waiting, oh I am waitingEmbed
