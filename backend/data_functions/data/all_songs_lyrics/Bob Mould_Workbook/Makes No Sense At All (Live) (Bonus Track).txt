Makes No Sense At All (Live) (Bonus Track) LyricsWalking around with your head in the clouds
Makes no sense at all
Sell yourself short, but you're walking so tall
Makes no sense at all
Is it important?
You're yelling so loud
Makes no sense at all
Walking around with your head in the clouds
Makes no sense at all
Makes no difference at all
I don't know why you want to tell me
When I'm right or when you're wrong
It's the same thing, in your mind, the only time
I'm right is when I play along
You concern yourself with evidence
It's evident to me
Well you say you've got the tiger by the tail
But I don't see these things that wayEmbed
