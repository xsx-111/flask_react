Celebrated Summer (Live) (Bonus Track) LyricsLove and hate was in the air, like pollen from a flower
Somewhere in April time, they add another hour
I guess I'd better think up a way to spend my time
Just when I'm ready to sit inside, it's summer time
Should I go fishing or get a friend to hang around
It's back to summer, back to basics, hang around
Getting drunk out on the beach, or playing in a band
And getting out of school meant getting out of hand
Was this your celebrated summer? Was that your celebrated summer?
Then the sun disintegrates between a wall of clouds
I summer where I winter at, and no one is allowed there
Do you remember when the first snowfall fell
When summer barely had a snowball's chance in HelEmbed
