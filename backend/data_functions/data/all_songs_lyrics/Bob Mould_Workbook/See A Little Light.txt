See A Little Light LyricsListen, there's music in the air
I heard your voice coming from somewhere
But look how much we've grown
Well, I guess I should have known
As the years go by, they take their toll on you
Think of all the things we wanted to do
And all the words we said yesterday
Well, that's a long time ago
You didn't think I'd really go now
Are you waiting? I know why
You're already saying goodbye
Are you ready? I know why
I see a little light
I know you will
I can see it in your eyes
I know you still care
But if you want me to go
You should just say so
(Chorus)
Are you waiting? I know why
You're already saying goodbye
Are you ready? I know why
I see a little light
I know you will
I can see it in your eyes
I know you still care
I see a little light
I know you will
I can see it in your eyes
Ah, ah, ah, ooh
(Chorus x3)Embed
