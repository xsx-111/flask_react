All Those People Know (Bonus Track) LyricsAll those people know
The way it really goes
I went to all the streets
Without much food or clothes
And everybody knows
The difference between
The truth I bring to you
The lies all in a scene
(x2)
Leave if you must
If you want to be asked to
But what's left is the rest
Leave if you must
If you want to be asked to be left
What's left is the rest
Ohhhh
All those people know
The way it really goes
I went to all the streets
Without much food or clothes
And everybody knows
The difference between
The truth I bring to you
The lies all in a scene
Leave if you must
If you want to be asked to
But what's left is the rest
Leave if you must
If you want to be asked to be left
What's left is the rest
And everyone knows (x13)Embed
