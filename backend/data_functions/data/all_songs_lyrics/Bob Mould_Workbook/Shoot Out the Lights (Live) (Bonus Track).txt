Shoot Out the Lights (Live) (Bonus Track) LyricsIn the dark, who can see his face?
In the dark, who can reach him?
He hides like a child
He hides like a child
Keeps his finger on the trigger
You know he can't stand the day
Shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights
Keep the blind down on the window
Ah, keep the pain on the inside
Just watching the dark
Just watching the dark
Ah, he might laugh but you won't see him
As he thunders through the night
Shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights
In the darkness the shadows move
In the darkness the game is real
Real as a gun
Real as a gun
As he watches the lights of the city
And he moves through the night
Shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights
Ah, shoot out the lightsEmbed
