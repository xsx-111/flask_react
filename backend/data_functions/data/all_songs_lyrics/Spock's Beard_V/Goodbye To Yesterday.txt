Goodbye To Yesterday LyricsWhen all that's good seems to wear you down
When the river is far and wide
And you can't stand up for falling down
You're a believer who's found they lied
And the past has your hands firmly tied
Try ... to find a way
Try ... to say goodbye to yesterday
Goodbye to yesterday ... say goodbye ...
When you push they push on you
It's hand to mouth and day to day
Do you have your baggage or do your bags have you?
You're doing fine - It's not too late
To lay your burden down and walk through heaven's gate
Try ... to find a way
Try ... to say goodbye to yesterday
Goodbye to yesterday
Say goodbye
You've got to find a way
To say goodbye ...Embed
