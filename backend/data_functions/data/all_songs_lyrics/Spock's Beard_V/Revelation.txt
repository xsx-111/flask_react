Revelation LyricsGot a locket on a string
She caresses as she brings me jasmine tea
Breaking out of who she was
She confesses that she's not sure how
And I cannot explain now
But the rain keeps coming down
It's the rain of revelation
Just keeps comin' down
Just keeps comin' down
It's the pain of pure elation
Just keeps comin' down
Just keeps comin' down
She's a shifted paradigm
She's my partner in my crime against the clock
If she's the wind then I'm a fan
Blowing through and changing who I am
And I don't understand how
But she's blowing through me now....
It's the rain of revelation
Just keeps comin' down
Just keeps comin' down
It's the pain of pure elation
I can't live without
I can't live without, I can't live with....
I had somethin' black and somethin' blue
But I never heard a thing that's true
And I always thought there's nothing new under the sun
And I cannot explain now
But the rain keeps coming down
It's the rain of revelation
Just keeps comin' down
Just keeps comin' down
It's the pain of pure elation
I can't live without
I can't live without
It's through now.....
I've gone undergroundEmbed
