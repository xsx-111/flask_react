Thoughts (Part II) LyricsI thought I'd come to you and say
All the things I had on my mind
I thought it might be really great
To show you how I feel inside
Then I think ... MAYBE NOT ...
You wouldn't speak to me
I would be left behind
We'd be through if you knew
All the things in my mind
I'd probably feel worse
You'd probably scream and shout
Scratch and curse or even worse
Quietly shut me out
I thought I'd come to you and say
Everything within my heart
I just can't look the other way
And wait for us to grow apart
Then I think ... WHAT'S THE POINT?
This might just go away
I think I'll think some more
Either way I will pay
And suffer for evermore
You wouldn't speak to me
I would be left behind
We'd be through if you knew
All the things in my mind
I thought I'd come to you and say
All the things I had on my mind ...1Embed
