All On A Sunday LyricsAll on a Sunday
I woke in the morning
But my head said too soon
So I slept until noon
In the blink of a memory
My consciences left me
And it stayed gone until
The sun came to fill the room
I wanna live just like you
I wanna feel like you do
I wanna lay it down
All on a Sunday
I wanna fly to the moon
I'll see the world from my room
All on a Sunday
The wind and the weathering were on channel 14
So I flipped to Ben-Hur
Feeling warm and secure
The stars of the 80's
And the corporate ladies
Flashed on my screen
'Til I started to dream again
I wanna live just like you
I wanna feel like you do
I wanna lay it down
All on a Sunday
I wanna fly to the moon
I'll see the world from my room
All on a Sunday
I wanna live like the longest and curviest driveway
Tucked in bed no one knows that I've lost my mind
I wanna live just like you
I wanna feel like you do
I wanna lay it down
All on a Sunday
I wanna fly to the moon
I'll see the world from my room
All on a SundayEmbed
