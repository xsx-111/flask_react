The Great Nothing LyricsI. From Nowhere
(Instrumental)
II. One Note
One note timeless
Came out of nowhere
It wailed like the wind and night
It sought no glory
It added no meaning
Not even a reason why
No thought
No need to say something
No message to sell
It played without a buzz or a showing
Out of the great nothing
It came without fail
One man with his mind full
Trying to get somewhere
He thought, "Man this thing could fly!"
He had good intentions, even some feeling
He thought, "Lord, I've got to try ..."
No thought
He had to say something
His message would sell
He got a buzz without knowing
Into the great nothing
The boy slipped and fell
III. Come Up Breathing
Come up breathing
Up from the water
Man, he was so submerged
Where's the feeling?
It must be way under
Far from the spoken word
No, no - no corporate ladder
No hometown parade
The fat cats just keep getting fatter
What does it matter
The thing must be played...
One note timeless...
Don't let the buzz get you down
Don't lose your memory or you'll sink fast and drown
But you can't seem to sleep for the thoughts in your mind
Since you can't stand to think you have one hell of a time
Hanging with submergers you drink yourself blind
You think it's fine
You've got time...
IV. Submerged
The boy has got potential
But he's never had commercial success
There's flies in his ointment
There's Stuyvesants and liquor on his breath
We'll have him charge the gate
We'll have to set him straight
We'll have him seal his future fate
Before it's too late
I worked with him closely
It must have been ten years ago
Of all the pains in the asses
He's the worst
I've had the bad taste to know
He's undirectable
Completely uncoachable
But perhaps we can put him
In an altered state
Before it's too late
V. Missed Your Calling
See the writing on the wall
Once the man who had it all
You threw it all away, look around and nothing's left
You've got nothing to forget
No golden yesterday
'Cause you missed your calling
You could have lived up in the sky
You missed your calling every time
Watch the lady throw the rune
Have her come up to your room
She comes from Montreal
There's no limelight only lime
And Tequila's made you blind
It's time to lose it all
'Cause you missed your calling
You could have lived up in the sky
You missed your calling one more time
The boy has got potential
But he'll never have commercial success
We gave him good direction
But he always thought that he knew what's best
We tried to set him straight
His calls will have to wait
We tried to change his future fate
But now it's too late
Something keeps telling quiet now, quiet now - quiet now
Mother says quiet down, quiet down - quiet down...
VI. The Great Nothing
One note timeless
Came out of nowhere
Just when all hope was gone
And nothing matters
But that it's breathing
It ends as it has begun
No thought
No need to say something
No message to run
From the ashes
Out of the great nothing
Without a buzz or a showing
Out of the great nothing
With nobody knowing
It plays on and on ...Embed
