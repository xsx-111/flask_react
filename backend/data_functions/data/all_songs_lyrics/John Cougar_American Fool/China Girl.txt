China Girl LyricsChina girl
I met you on the sea sand
You touched me with your cool hand
Your perfume's in the wind
China girl
Your daddy tells you white lies
To keep you from my blue eyes
To know me is no sin
And I won't break you, China girl
If you take me into your world
It's been my good fortune to find you
China girl
Stolen flowers are sweetest in the mornin'
The Eastern sun is dawnin'
Your silk's against my skin
China girl
Take me to your jasmine place
Cool me with your subtle grace
To know me is no sin
And I won't break you, China girl
If you take me into your world
It's been my good fortune to find you
China girl
And I won't break you, China girl
If you take me into your world
It's been my good fortune to...
Find you, China girl
If you take me into your world
It's been my good fortune to find you
