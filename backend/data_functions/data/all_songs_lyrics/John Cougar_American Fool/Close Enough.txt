Close Enough LyricsI may not be a pillar in my town
Or have the kind of job you think that I should
I know you see me out running around with a couple of people
You think are no good
I've tried to clean it up a couple of times, but I'm a
Backslidin' fool when it comes to walkin' that line
It's OK. You think you're better than me
Yeah, that's all right, girl, that's all right

'Cause I'm close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
I'm close enough for a little rock and roll
Yeah, it's true, I don't plan my time
When you're lookin' for me, I'm hard to find
I know you don't wanna run around with me
With my socks fallin' down, girl, I'm just poor company
I've seen your face, and it's a one-eyed jack
We like to talk about this or that
None of these things really interest me
Hey, that's all right, girl, that's all right
'Cause I'm close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
I'm close enough for a little rock
I know you think I'm a rough cut, baby
I ain't as rough cut as I am the blood on your hands
Gonna love that blood right off of your hands

Yeah, that's all right, girl, that's all right
Close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
I'm close enough for a little rock and rollEmbed
