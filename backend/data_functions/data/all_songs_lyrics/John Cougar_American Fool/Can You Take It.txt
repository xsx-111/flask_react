Can You Take It LyricsI was courting a Southern belle
Her daddy was a rich 'un, too
Sports car outside her door
She was pretty good looking, too
You call me up, want me to come over
When the servants are all in bed
And she said
"Daddy's on a flight tonight
Does that put any ideas in your head?"
I say to her:
Take it all the way
Can you really take it all the way down?
Can you really take it all the way down, down, down?
Down, down, down
So we watch a little TV
I drink up the family wine
She said, "You're such a snake in the grass, boy
But tonight, you're mine."
But wait a minute, wait a minute, baby
Are you tryin' to make a fool out of me?
She said, "I've seen men like you before
I've got a long family tree."
And she said to me:
Take it all the way
Can you really take it all the way down?
Can you really take it all the way down, down, down?
And I say to myself:
Even a fool like me can be the lovin' kind
Even a fool like me can be the lovin', lovin' kind
Take it all the way
Can you really take it all the way down?
Can you really take it all the way down, down, down?
Take it all the way
Can you really take it all the way down?
Can you really take it all the way down, down, down?Embed
