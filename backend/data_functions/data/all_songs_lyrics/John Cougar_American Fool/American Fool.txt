American Fool LyricsSome people say I'm obnoxious and I'm lazy
Some people say I take advantage of the younger girls and they're right
Some people say should have been taught a few more manners at home
Some say I'm chauvinistic better of just to leave me alone
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
If I can't please myself could I really please you?
Being brought up
The American fool
Being brought up
The American fool
Some people like to talk and tell you their ideals and how it's supposed to be
Some people are fools like me and say what's on their mind immediately
Some people don't say at all and some just care too much
Some people, some people, some people are driving me crazy
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
When I can't please myself could I really please you?
Some people say I'm obnoxious and I'm lazy
Some people say I take advantage of the younger girls and they're right
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
If I can't please myself could I really please you?Embed
