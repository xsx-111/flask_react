Gene by Gene Lyrics
I got a brain, it's a left hand drive
I don't sleep, other side
I ride a bullet like Steve McQueen
Each town I intervene
A gram of kief and the barn is jumping
It's alright, we got time
I got a radio hit in mind
I can't see, am I blind?

Every night and day I never dug it
In the U.S.A, I delete myself

Gotta get to know you gene by gene
You're my jellybean
Get out the shower
And I'm four fifteen
When I'm dead, when I'm clean
Fatboy and the barn is pumping
It's alright, it's just tight
Got to get into a better business
Deep down happiness

Every night and day I never dug it
In the U.S.A, I delete myself
I delete myself3Embed
