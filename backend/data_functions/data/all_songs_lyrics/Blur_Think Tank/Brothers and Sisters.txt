Brothers and Sisters Lyrics
Brothers and sisters
Rebuild your lives
We're all drug takers
Give us something tonight

A cartoon in a ketamine
Jelly mixed with margarine
White doves from the war machine
Every body moving
Cocaine is for murderers
Codeine for the jurors
Caffeine been through all of us
Everybody horny
Crackwhores back in town again
Eggships sniffing benelyn
Burning all the oil again
Smoking makes you holy
Textin abbreviates the brain
Aspirin takes away the pain
Rock on, everyone the same
That's the way it is

Brothers and sisters
Rebuild your lives
We're all drug takers
Give us something tonight
Rohypnol like a chloroform
Sugar from the day you are born
Washed out like a dinosaur
Really don't believe it
Sticky sniffing superglue
Sulphates keeps you in a zoo
Monkeys turning into you
Everybody horny
Acid good up on the moors
Gimpo stops you getting bored
Beta's busy making laws
Procaine stops you screaming
Librium for anxiety
Drinking is our society
Guessing out of tirety
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
Even when we're pissed
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

Brothers and sisters
Rebuild your lives
We're all drug takers
Give us something tonight2Embed
