Crazy Beat Lyrics
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah
Crazy beat crazy crazy crazy...


You got to get it together, stop shooting at me
You're just a teenage industry
Why are the C.I.A. having fun
They think you're clever because you've blown up your lungs

But I love to hear that crazy beat
Gets the people dancing on their feet
And I love to hear the paradise
I love my brothers on a Saturday night yeah

Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah
Break up

I'm on my mobile and I'm talking to the president
I got to get him for the money I've spent
Trying to get him to party with me
And even offered him ecstasy
But I love to hear that crazy beat
Gets the people dancing on their feet
And I love to hear the paradise
I love my sister and I love her tonight

Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah

Break up
It's a beat

But I love to hear that crazy beat
Gets the people dancing on their feet
And I love to hear the paradise
I love my brothers on a Saturday night
But I love to hear that crazy beat
Gets the people dancing on their feet
And I love to hear the paradise
I love that feeling and I love her tonight
And I love to hear that crazy beat
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)Embed
