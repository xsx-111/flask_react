Caravan Lyrics
Caravan's lost
To sun and the dust
No-one loves you
When you are lost
Yeah I'm a clown
Pulling my world down
I believed I was strong
But you are the stone

And when it comes
You'll feel the weight of it
The weight of it
The day will come
And you'll get away from it
Away from it

Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

I try to quit
But my heart won't buy it
I got family
The caravan comes back for me
And when it comes
You'll feel the weight of it
The weight of it
And the day will come
And you'll get away from it
Away from it

Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la5Embed
