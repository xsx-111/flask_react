Good Song Lyrics
Waiting, got no town to hide in
The country's got a hold of my soul
TV's dead and there ain't no war in my head, no
And you seem very beautiful to me

Sleeping but my work's not done
I could be lying on an atom bomb
I'll take care cause I know you'll be there
And you seem very beautiful to me

It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling and rolling
Picture in my pocket looks like you
It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling, rolling, rolling along6Embed
