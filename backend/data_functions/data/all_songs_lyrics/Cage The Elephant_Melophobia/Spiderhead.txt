Spiderhead Lyrics
I am the one you left for dead
Say you want it, too
You are the bullet in my head
And as you stand over my grave
Tell me it's okay
Your porcelain lips upon my face

Either I'm in heaven, or I'm in hell
Am I losing my mind here? 'Cause I can't tell
I've been waiting for answers for way too long
Seems I'm always waiting around

Spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
You may take my eyes, but baby, I'm not blind
It all works out in time, you know I'm gonna be alright
You may take my eyes, but baby, I'm not blind

Talk to me now

I think your mother wants me dead
Say you want it, too
I am a schizophrenic man
I wouldn't change you if I could
Say you want me, too
Treat me cold, I'll play it cool
Spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
You may take my eyes, but baby, I'm not blind
It all works out in time, you know I'm gonna be alright
You may take my eyes, but baby, I'm not blind

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
You may take my eyes, but baby, I'm not blind
It all works out in time, you know I'm gonna be alright
You may take my eyes, but baby, I'm not blind18Embed
