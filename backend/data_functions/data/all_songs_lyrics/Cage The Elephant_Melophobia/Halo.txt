Halo Lyrics
Every time I get away
You find a way to reel me back in, aah
Tell me that you love me
Hold me tight so we can always be friends, aah
I swear
I said it before and I'll say it again! Aah
Every time I get away
You find a way to pull me back in, aah

Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?
Why does it take so long?

You knew I couldn't help myself
I had to lay low
Got so high, couldn't help myself
I lost my halo

Took me by the hand and said remember all the good times we had, aah
I remember how you took my favorite knife
And slipped it under my skin, aah
I swear
I said it before and I'll say it again! Aah
Every time I get away
You find a way back under my skin
Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?

You knew I couldn't help myself
I had to lay low
Got so high, couldn't help myself
I lost my halo

All my life with a skeleton
I had to let go
Got so high, couldn't help myself
I lost my halo
I lost my halo
I lost my halo14Embed
