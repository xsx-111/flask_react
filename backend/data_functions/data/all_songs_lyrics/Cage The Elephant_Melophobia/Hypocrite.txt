Hypocrite Lyrics
Tonight, bleeding from the holes in my face
But I don't want to give it away
You did it for the family name
Crash collide into space
You, your favorite color red
I guess that I'm the hypocrite
You're not responsible
I'm responsible

Who's to blame?
Tell me, who's to blame?
Tell me who

I won't ever do that again
I've been all over the place
I watched the strawberry fields
Dry up and wither away
And if you ask me to stay
You know that's where I will be
Won't ever do that again
Don't wanna do that again

You call me Baby Blue
For all the evil schemes I pull
We sit and watch the waves break
I made a lot of mistakes
Crash collide into space
Who's to blame?
Tell me, who's to blame?
Tell me who

I won't ever do that again
I've been all over the place
I watched the strawberry fields
Dry up and wither away
And if you ask me to stay
You know that's where I will be
Won't ever do that again
Don't wanna do that again

Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh

I won't ever do that again
I've been all over the place
I watched the strawberry fields
Dry up and wither away
And if you ask me to stay
You know that's where I will be
Donâ€™t wanna do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do that again
Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh
