Take It Or Leave It Lyrics
Baby, you should know by now that I’m right for you
But every time I step to you, you change your tune
Sweet wheel of death keeps us holding our breath
I step to the right, you move to the left
And there's no one else I'd rather die to myself

Oh why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm starting to unwind
I've been tripping over you
So tell me something new
Take it or leave it

Maybe I should pack my things and move on
Maybe I'm fooling myself and you're already gone
Watching the flames wither and fade
Trying to make sense of the look on your face
I'm down on my knees just praying that I can hold on

Oh why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm learning to unwind
I've been tripping over you
So tell me something new
Take it or leave it
Baby, please
Oh baby, please
Stay with me
Or cut me free
It’s killing me

Oh why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm starting to unwind
I've been tripping over you
So tell me something new
Take it or leave it
Take it or leave it18Embed
