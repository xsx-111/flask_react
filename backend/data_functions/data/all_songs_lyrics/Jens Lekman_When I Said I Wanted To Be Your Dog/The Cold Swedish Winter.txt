The Cold Swedish Winter Lyrics
I met her in a snowstorm
I was outdoors plowing
She just walked up to me and said
"Hey boy, how's it going?"
I admired her straight-forwardness
And brushed away my fringe
As a signal of well-being
And accepting her challenge
We went home to her place
And cooked up some chili
Warmed us from the inside
Cause the outside was chilly
We had to be quiet
To not wake up her family
But I made a high-pitched sound
When her cold fingers touched me

She said "shhh
Please be quiet
I know you don't want to
But please deny it"
She said "shhh
Please be quiet
I know you don't want to
But please deny it"

When people think of Sweden
I think they have the wrong idea
Like Cliff Richard who thought it was just
Porn and gonorrhea
And Lou Reed said in the film
"Blue in the Face"
That compared to New York City
Sweden was a scary place
They seem to have a point
After meeting with this girl
Maybe not Cliff Richard
But Lou has surely met her
The doubt in her eyes
When I said I wanted to kiss her
For the sake of liking her
And not because of the blizzard
She said "shhh
Please be quiet
I know you don't want to
But please deny it"
She said "shhh
Please be quiet
I know you don't want me
But please deny it
Cause the cold Swedish winter
Is right outside
And I just want somebody
To hold me through the night
The cold Swedish winter
Is right outside
And I just want somebody
To hold me through the night"

In two thousand years
This place will be covered by ice
And the people who will dig us up
Will be in for a big surprise
After carefully studying
Our calcium-nourished bones
They'll find enclosed
Our hearts of stone

Singing the cold Swedish winter
Is right outside
And I just want somebody
To hold me through the night
The cold Swedish winter
Is right outside
And I just want somebody
To hold me through the night1Embed
