If You Ever Need a Stranger (To Sing at Your Wedding) LyricsIf you ever need a stranger
To sing at your wedding
A last minute choice, then I am your man
I know every song, you name it
By Bacharach or David
Every stupid love song that's ever touched your heart
Every power ballad that's ever climbed the charts
You think it's funny
My obsession with the holy matrimony
But I'm just so amazed to witness true love
And true love can be measured
Through these simple pleasures
They are waiting there for you to be discovered
I would cut off my right arm to be someone's lover
And maybe I'll meet her there tonight at the wedding buffet
I walk up to her
When she's caught the bouquet (Ooh, ooh)
And oh
It's just like a whirlwind
(Ooh, ooh)
(Aah, ooh)Embed
