Tram #7 to Heaven Lyrics
Did you take tram number seven to heaven?
Did you eat your banana from 7-Eleven?
I'm driving in my daddy's car
Life is aching in my heart
If we someday have to part
Where do I go when you take

Tram number seven to heaven
Tram number seven to heaven
Tram number seven to heaven

I'm walking
I'm walking in your tracks
Millions have turned backs
Fifteen heart attacks later

Tram number one is full of fun
Tram number two is couchie coo
Tram number three is misery
Tram number four knocks at your door
Tram number five I'm still alive
Tram number six I think I'm fixed
Tram number seven
Tram number seven to heaven
Tram number seven to heaven
Tram number seven to heaven
Tram number seven to heaven

I'm fixed
I'm fixed
I'm fixed
I'm fixed
I'm fixed
I'm fixed
I'm fixedEmbed
