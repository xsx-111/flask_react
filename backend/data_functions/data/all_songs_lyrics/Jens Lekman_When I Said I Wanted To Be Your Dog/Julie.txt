Julie Lyrics
Oh Julie
Meet me by the vending machine
Oh Julie
I'm gonna buy you a wedding ring

Eating french fries by the dock of the bay
Lots of ketchup and mayonnaise
You said this town's too big for our hearts
You can't tell where it ends or starts

Oh Julie
The future could be so bright
Oh Julie
The ticket inspector's out of sight

What will you do when you graduate
If you stay here you'll suffocate
And all your friends are moving to London
While the cherry trees are still in blossom

Oh Julie
Oh hold me
Hold me trough the sweet hereafter
Being with you can be very fatal
Somehow we forget to pray for the angels
Then the angels make sure that our hearts are devoured
Make us jump from the Eiffel Tower

Oh Julie
You know that I ain't for hire
But you can have me
You can trade me for your cigarette lighter

Take a step from the humdrum
Tearing down the Coliseum
They said we'd hit the bottom
But the cherry trees are still in blossom

Julie
You know that I ain't for hire
But you can have me
You can trade me for your cigarette lighter

Oh JulieEmbed
