You Are the Light (By Which I Travel into This and That) LyricsYeah, I got busted
So I used my one phone call to dedicate
A song to you on the radio
Yeah, I got busted
In custody, I imagined our melody
Being played on a grand piano
I saw your face in front of me
It was perfect clarity
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel
And it was you
Cause you are the light by which I travel into this and that
You are the light
You are the light by which I travel into this and that
Yeah, I got busted
I painted a dirty word on your old man's Mercedes-Benz cause you told me to do it
Yeah, I got busted
But soon they released me cause the cops were sad
And they didn't know how to prove it
Oh, I saw your face in front of me
It was perfect clarity
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel
And it was you
Cause you are the light by which I travel into this and that
You are the light
You are the light by which I travel into this and that
It's all so obvious, so obvious
Why would anyone need a map or a compass?
It's so beautiful
To be guided by you
Cause you are the light
You are the light by which I travel into this and that
You are the light
You are the light by which I travel into this and that
You are the light, light
You are the light, lightEmbed
