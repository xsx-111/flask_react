Do You Remember the Riots? LyricsDo you remember the riots in Gothenburg
In the summer of 2001?
Boy, we sure had fun
I held your hand so proud
It was shaking from what I learned was doubt
In the warm summer sun
And I saw my face on a screen
They filmed us from a helicopter
The most frightened face I've seen
Red in the face like a lobster
Do you remember the riots in Gothenburg
In the summer of 2001?
Boy, we sure had fun
Down the avenue
The black, black crew are throwing rocks at the cop stand then everything stop
They started a bonfire
A couple of days prior
I wanted to do that, too
Burn down the avenue
And I saw my face on a screen
They filmed us from a helicopter
The most frightened face I've seen
Red in the face like a lobster
And your hand slipped out of mine
I couldn't see no love in your eyes
I knew what I had to do
Burn the avenue
And I'm not a political fighter
And I don't even have a cigarette lighter
But I wanna see that fire
I just wanna see that fire (Wanna see that fire)
I just wanted to see that fire
Burn down the avenue
Do you remember the riots in Gothenburg
In the summer of 2001?
Boy, we sure had funEmbed
