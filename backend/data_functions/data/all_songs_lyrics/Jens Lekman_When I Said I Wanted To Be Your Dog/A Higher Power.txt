A Higher Power LyricsShe said, "let's put a plastic bag over our heads
And then kiss and stuff
'Til we get dizzy and fall on the bed"
We were in heaven for five or six minutes
And then we passed out
And I was so in love, I thought I knew what love was all about
In church on Sunday, making out in front of the preacher
You had a black shirt on with a big picture of Nietzsche
When we had done our thing for a full Christian hour
I had made up my mind that there must be a higher power
A higher, higher power
A higher, higher power
At the Christmas party, I hold your hair when you vomit
I help you up to brush your teeth
And then I kiss your stomach
We lie still on your bed
The room is lit only by the telly
And it's a perfect night for feeling melancholy
A higher, higher power
A higher, higher powerEmbed
