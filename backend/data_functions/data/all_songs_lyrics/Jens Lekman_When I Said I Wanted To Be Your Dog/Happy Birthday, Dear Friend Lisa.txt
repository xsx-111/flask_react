Happy Birthday, Dear Friend Lisa LyricsOh happy birthday, happy birthday
Little Lisa, today is your day
Sing hallelujah, you know they blew ya'
There are too many candles in your cake
But don't you worry, there's no hurry
The Jehovah's are standing by your door
And they are offering eternal suffering
Eternal life, but you say no
Turn on the radio, clean the windows
Do it in slow-mo as the day unfolds
Oh how the sun shines inside you, just like I do these days are gold
The nights are silver, they make you shiver
Tomorrow the Jehovah's will come by
And they will ask you of an excuse
Not to accept eternal life
Aah
But I love you, yes I love you
But I would never kiss your lips
Cause there's a friendship, a lovely kinship
Here's a tulip to match your eyes
Oh drinking cheap wine to bossa nova
You're a supernova in the sky
The Jehovah's in their pull-overs
Are no Casanovas like you and I
Oh happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Oh happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Oh happy birthday, little Lisa
Happy birthday to youEmbed
