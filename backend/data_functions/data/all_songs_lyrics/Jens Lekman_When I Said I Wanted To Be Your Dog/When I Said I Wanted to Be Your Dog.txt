When I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog LyricsEvery day you make a fine loaf of bread
And after work just before sunset
You head down to the city park
There you're alone with the birds in the dark
And I've seen other people do that too
But they're old and you're 22
They lost hope and soon they'll be gone
They'll just vanish with the setting sun
But I know, yes I know
They're flying within you again
But I won't let them get you
Cause you're my only friend
You're my only friend
When I said I wanted to be your dog
I wasn't coming on to you
I just wanted to lick your face
Lick those raindrops from the rainy days
You can take me for a walk in the park
I'll be chasing every single lark
I'll be burying all the skeleton bones
Peeing on every cold black stone
But I know, yes I know
They're flying within you again
But I won't let them eat you
Cause you're my only friend
My friend
My only friend
You're my friend1Embed
