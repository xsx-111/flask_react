Running From My Soul LyricsOoh woman, taste my rock and roll
Ooh woman, make it hot as coal
And I'm running
Running to my very soul
One day woman walking down that street
I saw my lover she sure looked sweet
Oh now mean I feel my rock and roll
And I'm running
Running to my soul
Ooh woman, taste my rock and roll
Ooh woman, make it hot as coal
And I'm running
Running to my very soulEmbed
