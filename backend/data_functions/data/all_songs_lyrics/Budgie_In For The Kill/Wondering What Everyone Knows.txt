Wondering What Everyone Knows LyricsI never walk in the street
Or gather round where people meet
With you on my head and me on my toes
Wondering what everyone knows
Wondering what everyone knows
I bystand for the post, but all my letters are lost
With you on my head and me on my toes
Wondering what everyone knows
Wondering what everyone knows
Wondering what everyone knows
Darkness in white you can feel through the light
Of the darkest cloud and touch my hand
You are a sound in my head
Sew up my ears with your thread
With you on my head and me on my toes
Wondering what everyone knows
Wondering what everyone knows
Wondering what everyone knowsEmbed
