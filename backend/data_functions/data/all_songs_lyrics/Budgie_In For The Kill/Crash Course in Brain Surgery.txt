Crash Course in Brain Surgery Lyrics
Look inside, and you will see
That words are cutting deep inside my brain
Thunder burning, quickly turning
Knife of words is driving me insane
Insane
Yeah, yeah

Raven black is on my track
He's shown me how to neutralize the knife
Show to me in surgery
The art of finding words to conquer life
Conquer life
Yeah, yeah

Oh, baby, like that rock and roll
Oh, baby, get out of my soul

Now the wicked lance I fear
Driven from my heavy mounted brain
Crash course in brain surgery
Stop the bloody knife of love again
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
