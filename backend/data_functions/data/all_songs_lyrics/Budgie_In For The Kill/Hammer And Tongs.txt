Hammer And Tongs LyricsWoman I can hear you woman in my soul
I wish I was your daddy I wish I was your mammy
Just lay down your hammer and tongs
Woman I can love you woman think you know
I wish I was you daddy I wish I was your mammy
Just lay down your hammer and tongs
Woman live like a song look around at
Who you see the tongs
Woman see the marks of life
That you thought are right are wrongEmbed
