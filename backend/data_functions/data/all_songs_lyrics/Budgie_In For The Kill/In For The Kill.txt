In For The Kill LyricsLiving ain't easy it opens your head
Layin' and prayin' you wish you were dead
When I was born I was given a will
That the meaning of life is I'm in for the kill
Loving, knowing, giving, showing
Love is seeing and ever being
Motor cruising, midnight boozing
Altar singing and bells that are ringing
You got a reason to listen to me
For I am a messenger carrying the key
Money is nothing to hold into wills
And the meaning of life is I'm in for the kill
Loving, knowing, giving, showing
Love is seeing and ever being
Motor cruising, midnight boozing
Altar singing and bells that are ringing
You see me moving around, playing on people's minds
Well, I won't be for nobody, I only have a way of return
Take me and make me, do what you want
You ain't gonna mock up me
Well I am the tolls and I am the right
And I am the earth and the sea
Hey there, you with a look that is bruised
Gonna say it with a face that's red
It's only the ones who can take the pain
Who can wear that golden hat
I'm only trying to help you live in a world
That is hot and rough
It's me and you and a cat named Boo
And a woman who has run out of stuff
Lawman with a face of steel and a bone with a broken eye
You'll go with that Tokyo set and her name written over the sky
Road up, lost his song, you don’t really know
All birds in bikini wear, Lord she’s got a body to show
Mother of all it’ll make you strong to be what you will be
Wake up mad and you won’t be dead, you’ll stand alongside of me
Be a man or be a boy or be what you will be
Or be a dog or be a car but not a man like me
Living ain't easy it opens your head
Layin' and prayin' you wish you were dead
When I was born I was given a will
That the meaning of life is I'm in for the kill
Loving, knowing, giving, showing
Love is seeing and ever being
Motor cruising, midnight boozing
Altar singing and bells that are ringing
You got a reason to listen to me
For I am a messenger carrying the key
Money is nothing to hold into wills
And the meaning of life is I'm in for the killEmbed
