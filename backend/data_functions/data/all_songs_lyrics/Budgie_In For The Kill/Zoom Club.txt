Zoom Club LyricsCome on everyone of you g.i's
You are the ones who can care
Speed on you wonderful dropouts
We'll break the walls of this room in
Zoom along, superstar
All over the land
Move on music man
Come on everyone of you people
You ain't got mud in your eyes
Tell everybody with hunger
Eat up the music tonight
Come on you'll only get harder
I wanna get it to you
You are my life
You turn around in your zoot suit
Come on everyone of you preachers
You do the best that you can
Move on every one of you teachers
You do the best that you canEmbed
