Living On Your Own LyricsWhen you're living on your own
And things around you start to go
You're on your own, well baby you're on your own
When I see it in your smile
I can tell it ain't your style
You're on your own, well baby you're on your own
You're alone if you don't know it
And pretty soon, it takes its toll
Maybe I should ask you why
You need everything
But you ain't got it, cause you're living on your own
One day soon this will be gone
And the love of life it could be
But 'til then you'll look at me
Then you'll feel it grow
And you'll always know
You ain't got it living on your own
And when I see you look at me
And I can tell how it will be
You're on your own well baby you're on your own
I can tell the way you smile
And just you wait and in a while
You're on your own well baby you're on your ownEmbed
