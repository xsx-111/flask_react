Forests and Sands LyricsI'm in a van and you're holding my hand
You are traveling with me through forests and sands
I've been innocently learning your language
And you've been taking full advantage haven't you?
Oh, don't say it's true
I lost a friend I'm the saddest again
And we kissed once, even that was in lust
I know you need more than given moments
And sentimental sorries and words only spoken seem lame
And I won't win your heart that way
Oh, it feels like none of this is real
I pretend that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood
Pumping through my veins could freeze
Like the river in Toronto then I'd be pleased
You said I made you feel warm
Said I made you feel warm inside
Oh, it feels like none of this is real
I pretend that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood
Pumping through my veins could freeze
Like the river in Toronto then I'd be pleased
You said I made you feel warm
Said I made you feel warm inside
It feels like none of this is real
I pretend that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood
Pumping through my veins could freeze
Like the river in Toronto then I'd be pleased
You said I made you feel warm
Said I made you feel warm inside
If the blood
Could freeze
I'd be pleased
I'd be pleasedEmbed
