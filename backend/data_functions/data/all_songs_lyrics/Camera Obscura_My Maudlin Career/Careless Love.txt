Careless Love LyricsHoney, I've been really struggling to think of you
And I being friends
I blow hot and cold, yeah, I’m like a yo-yo
So I don’t think I should see you again
Careless love and acting tough
Oh, it wasn't my style I had enough
I don't think that we can really be friends
And honey, I've been really struggling to think of you
And I and all the mess
You're often bought and sold
The love you give ebb and flows
So I don't think I should see you again
Careless love and acting tough
Oh, it wasn't my style I had enough
I don't think that we can really be friends
But I'll try again...
Oh, the love I feel for you is real
Oh, the love I feel for you it is real
Honey, I've been really struggling
To see this thing through to the end
Careless love, acting tough
Oh, it wasn't my style I had enough
I don't think that we can really be friends
But I'll try again...Embed
