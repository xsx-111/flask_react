My Maudlin Career LyricsYou kissed me on the forehead, now this kiss is giving me a concussion
We were love at first sight, now this crush is crushing
I retraced your steps through the city of romance lazily
I took to the desert with your harshest words and they saved me
I'll bail you out again, I've got the readies
I'm not a child I know we're not going steady
Your pain's gigantic but it's not as big as your ego
I promise not to abandon you, please let me go
I've harbored worried feelings like they were worth protecting
You say I'm too kind and sentimental like you could catch affection
Oh in your eyes there's a sadness enough to kill the both of us
Are those eyes overrated? They make me want to give up on love
I'll brace myself for the loneliness
Say hello to feelings that I detest
This maudlin career must come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career must come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career must come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career must come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career must come to an end
I don't want to be sad againEmbed
