You Told a Lie LyricsIf you were a season, you would be in bloom
I wish I had good reason to see you soon
No need to convince me that you were a catch
I bought my ticket I'm sold at last
Who was it that said that love conquers all?
Oh he was a fool cause it doesn't at all
Should I believe you told a lie?
On the way to my heart and on the way back
Are my eyes the coldest blue?
You said once this was true
If it is I don't know what I'll do
Cause I'm stuck with them
And they're stuck on you
Was I a quiet little nothing that never challenged anyone?
Or was I a lazy, lazy snake?
Do you want me to be a gentle diplomat?
Oh you can beg and you can plead
Are my eyes the coldest blue?
You said once this was true
If it is I don't know what I'll do
Cause I'm stuck with them
And they're stuck on you
Are my eyes the coldest blue?
You said once this was true
If it is I don't know what I'll do
Cause I'm stuck with them
And you're stuck on you
Cause I'm stuck with them
And they're stuck on you
I'm stuck with him
And they're stuck on you
I'm stuck with them
And they're stuck on youEmbed
