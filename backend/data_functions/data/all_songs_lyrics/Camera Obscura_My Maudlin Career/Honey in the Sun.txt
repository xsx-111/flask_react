Honey in the Sun Lyrics
A half full moon in Mexico City I think of you
And when I saw the Southern Cross I wished you had too
I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew
But it's as warm as saxophones and honey in the sun for you
Oh, I've been spending half the year in a plane going up and down
And you've been seeing other people from a nearby town
Been obsessing and getting depressed about us
Excess baggage and other stupid band stuff

I wish my heart was cold but it's warmer than before
I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew
But it's as warm as saxophones and honey in the sun for you

When you said the veins in my left hand were shaped like a tree
Was that the very last time you really looked at me?
I'm in training to become as cold as ice
I'm determined to protect my feelings to disguise
And when I said I didn't love you, I told a lie
Because there is no one above you though I try
Would you laugh at the time I spent calling your name
Over and over and over and over again?

I wish my heart was cold but it's warmer than before
I wish my heart was cold but it's warmer than before
I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew
But it's as warm as saxophones and honey in the sun for you
The trouble is I got me close to hating me
And when I wake up in the morning it's your face I see
Oh, you once made me feel less afraid
You've got me pouring myself over this page

I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew
But it's as warm as saxophones and honey in the sun for youEmbed
