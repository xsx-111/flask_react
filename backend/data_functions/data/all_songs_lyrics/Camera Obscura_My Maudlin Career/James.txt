James LyricsJames, he came to my place
He said he had to see my face
He hopes that we can still be friends
In his own way, he'll love me till the end
And James, he came to the door
Wanting to know for sure
Why love gets up and goes
I'm sorry but it had no place to grow
Oh, James, my love for you is stronger, don't you know?
I'd like to celebrate you, dear
All in all it's been a pretty good year
I looked deep within myself
I got scared by just how hard I fell
Oh, James, you broke me, I thought I knew you well
Oh, you and me, honey and bee
Oh, sun and moon, I'll be fine by June
I could tell that you weren't well
Oh, James, you broke me, I thought I knew you well
Oh, James, you broke me, I thought I knew you wellEmbed
