Swans LyricsThere are flowers in my house
And I bought them myself
No surprises in the record collection
You must have thought I was someone else
I'm still afraid to get lost
In a city I might explore
But I'm not afraid to have
An eloquent boy at my door
At my door
At my door
At my door
Oh, you want to be a writer
Fantastic idea
You say you've never seen America
I really think you'll like it there
Maybe you should travel with me
Is this the best idea
Because you've never seen a Redwood
And you've never touched a deer
A deer
A deer
Dear
A deer
A deer
My dear
Are swans deceiving us all?
Oh I for one should know
I never felt myself so graceful
And I never swam so slow
So slow
So slow
So slowEmbed
