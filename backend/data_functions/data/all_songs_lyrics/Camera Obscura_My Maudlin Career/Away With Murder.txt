Away With Murder LyricsHow many times have you told me you wanna die?
How many times have you told me now that you've tried?
Oh and how many times will I let you get away with murder?
Oh and how many times will you make me feel more alive?
Hey, I got a feeling there's something going wrong
I put my thoughts in a letter, send it when I'm feeling strong
Ain't it time you became the girl that you wanted to be
Oh I told you all along there was no point looking to me
Oh, it's been hard to be strong
All of this going on
Yes, it's been hard to be strong
With all this going on
I've been lonely too, like you
I'm just like you
I'm just like you
People have been travelling miles just to hear us sing
It's a February night and I don't wanna feel anything
To get away, maybe I could sell kisses
In Portland I tried my pretty hand at fishing
Oh, it's been hard to be strong
With all this going on
Yes, it's been hard to be strong
With all this going on
I've been lonely too, like you
I'm just like you
I'm just like you
Hey, I got a feeling there's something going wrong
I put my thoughts in a letter, send it when I'm feeling strongEmbed
