Ferris Wheel on Fire Lyrics
Well now first of all
We became what we always had feared
Every engine holds
All their oils on fire appeared
They finally broke through
And on your shoulder
This weight has been placed upon you

And everything we ever were

But, now I'm keeping still
In someone's bright carnival ride
And all the crowd just cheers
As the bolts break and metal collides
Spiraling through
And flying up over the hills
And now everything's broken in two

And everything we ever were

But now most of all
I am holding you under my skin
Watch these buildings fall
Watch as each weak resistance caves in
All over you all implode
And now finally fading from view
Is everything we ever were
Now, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, IEmbed
