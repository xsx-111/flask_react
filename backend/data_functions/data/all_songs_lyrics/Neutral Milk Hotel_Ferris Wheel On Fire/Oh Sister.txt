Oh Sister Lyrics
Oh sister, don't be afraid of me
I won't be nailing you down in the nursery
Just like the rest of them did
With those watery, wandering fingers of spit
That were supposed to be glorious and fine
Oh sister, won't you believe in me
I only wanted to be hard on the family
Here with you now in this silly infirmary
Your mother makes frantic and drunk calls
From Germany all of the time
And oh sister, sweet brown and beulahery
And milk from your blisters
On your grandmother's jewelry
There in the parlor all naked in front of me
Watching the lights from the cracks
Making archery animal designs

Rose Wallace Goldaline just moves her mouth over anything
That's fleshy free and flowering like oranges out in the open
But don't you waste your sins again
She don't need you or won't fuck your friends
And you, you're American
Self-important boiling over
To prove that she must still exist
She moves herself about her fist
And won't ever never give a shit
About all those words you're wasting
To gain some pretty, bright and bubbly
Wondrous dream
You'd like to kill and cling
And claim her as your own
But don't you worry
All those dainty and dirty emotions
Just go away and fade out on their
Own sister, now that you're leaving
Our fingers will falter
Our lungs will be leaking
All over each other and without even speaking
We'll know that it's over and smile and go greeting
Whatever comes next
And oh, sister
You're getting married with some angry twister
That you'll have to carry home
Drunk every evening from the cemetery
If he makes it back half alive you can
Bury him under your sheets
And oh, sister
Now that you're grieving
I can not imagine there is any meaning
Forgetting you ever could once had
The feeling that made you keep on
And pretend you were breathing of all of this world
And in an age of empty rings
I don't want to feel a thing
I don't even want to know
And Rose Wallace Goldaline
Don't you ever die on me
Donâ€™t you own the way you go4Embed
