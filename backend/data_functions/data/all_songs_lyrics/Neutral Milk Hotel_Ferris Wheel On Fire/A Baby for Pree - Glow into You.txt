A Baby for Pree / Glow into You Lyrics
Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen
Makes babies to breathe
With their hearts hanging open
All over the sheets
As soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer
And with bees in her breath
And the rest of her ringing
They'll sting through her chest
With a force hard and beating
Till wonderfully wet
She will get until she's soaked inside her clothes
And there is no sorry to be sorry for
For a roll around the floor
Some afternoon so sound and soft
It made her swallow all her sweat
With every bit of breath she coughs
And when the day it came to pour
All her babies all across the bathroom floor
She will be swimming in them all forever more

Glow right into you
I will glow right into you
I will glow right into you
And I let you down
Swollen and small
Is where you'll find me now
That silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out
You'll never hear me talk

Glow right into you
I will glow right into you
I will glow right into you

And I will be strong
Strong enough to shout
Above your voice that's blaring on
With your face that's falling out
Into the dust of what you want
I'll never hear you talk

Glow right into you
I will glow right into you
I will glow right into you
Oh and with my little fingers
I could make it all crumble
I could make it all over
Before you would even know
