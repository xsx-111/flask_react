King of the Blues LyricsHe was born in Mississippi in 1924
He was born in Mississippi in 1924
Left his home with no money
He had to pay his dues
But he knew the time was coming
When he'll be king of the blues
King of the blues
Lost his heart to a woman
Lucy was her name
Lost his heart to a woman
Lucy was her name (yes, it was!)
When he hears her sing so sweetly
He knows he just can't lose
When he holds her in his arms he knows
That he's the king of the blues
He's "The Hunter" with the "Crosscut Saw"
"Born Under a Bad Sign"
Found his baby messin' down the "Laundromat"
He "Almost Lost his Mind"
Yeah!
He was born in Mississippi in 1924
He was born in ol' Mississippi in 1924
Doesn't need no Jester
To keep him amused
He's got Lucy by his side
He's making headline news
Doesn't need no palace
Like Freddie down in Dallas
Well you can call him what you like
I call him "King of the Blues"
(That's right! Mr Albert King of the blues!)
Let me hear you!Embed
