Too Tired LyricsI lay down last night
Too tired to wake
I had a chill this morning
Too tired to shake
I got a good poker hand
Too tired to win
I can hear my baby knockin'
Too tired to let her in
I'm tired
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm tired
Too tired
Too tired for anything
I'm too tired to walk
Too tired to run
I can hear my baby callin'
Too tired too tired
I'm tired
Yes I'm tired
I'm tired
Too tired for anything
(Take over Albert, I'm too tired for this!)
I'm tired of prospherity
I'm tired of luck
I'm sitting on a pin
I'm too tired to get up
I'm tired
I declare I'm tired
I'm too tired
Too tired for anything
(Oh Albert I'm tired!)
(You better take over, Albert!)
I'm too tired baby!Embed
