Walking by Myself LyricsYou know I love you
You know it's true
I'll give you all my love, babe
What more can I do
I'm walking by myself
I hope you understand
I just want to be your lovin' man
I love you
Yes I love you with my heart and soul
I wouldn't mistreat you
For my weight in gold
I said I'm walking by myself
I hope you understand
I just want to be your lovin'
I just want to be your lovin'
I just want to be your lovin' man
That's rightEmbed
