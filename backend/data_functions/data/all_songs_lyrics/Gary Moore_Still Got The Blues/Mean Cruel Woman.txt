Mean Cruel Woman LyricsIt was early one morning I was walking down the street
It was early one morning I was walking down the street
I saw my baby with another man
Made my poor heart skip a beat
Well she was looking at him
The way she looks at me
She was looking at him
The way she looks at me
I was blinded by my tears
I thought that I'd never see
Well she's a mean cruel woman
As cruel as a woman could be
She's a mean cruel woman
As cruel as a woman could be
This time you pushed me too far baby
You're gonna see the back of me
Well she's a mean cruel woman
As cruel as a woman could be
I said she's a mean cruel woman
Cruel as a woman could be
This time I'm walking out the door
You're gonna see the back of me
She's a mean cruel woman
As cruel as a woman can be
I said she's a mean cruel woman
Cruel as a woman could be
This time I'm walking out the door
You're gonna see the back of meEmbed
