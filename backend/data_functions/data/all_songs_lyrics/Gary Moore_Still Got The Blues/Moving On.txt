Moving On LyricsI'm gonna leave this place tomorrow
I'm gonna leave this town behind
I'll be gone before the morning
On the other side of the mound
That's why I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on
I've been tired of the same old faces
And I'm sick of the same old names
I'm getting bored with the same old places
Everybody starts to look the same
That's why I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on
I've been trying to settle down here
But my feet just won't stay still
And I heard that the grass is greener
On the other side of the hill
That's why I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on
Give me one more for the road!
I'm gonna leave this town tomorrow
I'm gonna leave this place behind
You can bet your bottom dollar
All my troubles will be far behind
That's why I'm moving on
I'm a-moving on
I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on
I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on
Said I've been hanging around too long
It's time I was moving on
Wow! Get out of here!Embed
