Midnight Blues LyricsIt's the darkest hour
Of the darkest night
It's a million miles
From the morning light
Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues
When the shadows fall
I feel the night closin' in
There must be some reason
For this mood I'm gettin' in
Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues
Every evening after sundown
As the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
Why these blues won't go away
Every evening after sundown
As the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
Why these blues won't go away
It's the darkest hour
Of the darkest night
It's a million miles
From the morning light
Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues
I've got those midnight blues
I've got those midnight blues
I've got those midnight bluesEmbed
