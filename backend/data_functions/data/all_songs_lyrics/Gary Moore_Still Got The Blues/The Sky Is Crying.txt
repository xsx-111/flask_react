The Sky Is Crying LyricsThe sky is cryin'
Look at the tears rollin' down the street
The sky is cryin'
Look at the tears rollin' down the street
I been lookin' for my baby
I wonder where she can be
That's right
I saw my baby one mornin'
And she was walkin' on down the street
I saw my baby one mornin'
And she was walkin' on down the street
Yes, she was
You know it hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat
Here we go, play it for me
I've got a bad, bad feelin'
My baby don't love me no more
I've got a bad, bad feelin'
My baby don't love me no more, no
The sky is cryin'
Woh, look at the tears rolling down my nose
The sky is cryin'
Look at the tears rollin' down the street, yeah
The sky is cryin'
Look at the tears rollin' down the street
I been lookin' for my baby
I wonder where my baby can beEmbed
