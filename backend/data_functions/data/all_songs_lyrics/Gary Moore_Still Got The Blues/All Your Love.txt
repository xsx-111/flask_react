All Your Love LyricsAll your lovin' is lovin'
All your kissin' is kissin'
All your lovin' is lovin'
All your kissin' is kissin'
Before I met you baby
I never knew what I was missin'
All your lovin' pretty baby
That I got in store for you
All your lovin' pretty baby
That I got in store for you
When I say I love you baby
You gotta say you love me too
All your lovin' pretty baby
That I got in store for you
All your lovin' pretty baby
That I got in store for you
When I say I love you baby
You gotta say you love me too
All your lovin' pretty baby
All your lovin' pretty baby
All your lovin' pretty baby
All your lovin' pretty baby
Before I met you baby
I never knew what I was missin'Embed
