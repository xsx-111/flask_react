Oh Pretty Woman LyricsOh pretty woman sure's the risin' sun
Says all your cheap paint and powder
Ain't gonna help you none
'Cos she's a pretty woman
Right down to her bones
So you might as well leave your skin alone
Pretty woman
What's the matter with you?
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Oh pretty woman whatcha gonna do
You kept on foolin' around
Till I got stuck on you
So you can drop your messin'
Come down off your throne
Stop using my poor heart
As just a steppin' stone
Pretty woman
What's the matter with you?
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Oh pretty woman that's all right for you
Now you just go on doin' what you wanna do
But someday when you think
That you got it made
You're gettin' water deep enough
So you can't wade
Pretty woman
What's the matter with you?
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Oh pretty woman
Just can't make you love meEmbed
