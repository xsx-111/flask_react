That Kind of Woman LyricsShe's that kind of woman
No doubt about how she feels
She's holding promises
Her eyes won't tell
Her lips are sealed
And I like her like that
She's kind of crazy
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
Standing in the doorway
With the sunlight in her hair
She's watching the wind blow
You know she don't have a care
I like her like that
She's kind of crazy
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
She's got to look so cool
You know what I mean
Got the wickedest smile that I've ever seen
I'd crash my heart on the side of the street
That she once stood on
She's that kind of woman
I like her like that
She's pretty amazing
I understand why I want some more
Of that kind of woman
One look from hell knocks me on the floor
That kind of woman
She's that kind of lady
That you meet in a dream of dreams
Put others in shadows
But you know this woman's real
And I like her like that
She's kind of crazy
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
I think I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
I said I know what I'm looking for
That kind of woman
That kind of woman
That kind of womanEmbed
