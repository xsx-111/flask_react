Left Me with the Blues LyricsI can't eat
I can't sleep
Stare at the ceiling
I'm counting sheep
Ever since you walked out
You left me with the blues
I get angry
I get mad
Think about before it turned so bad
Ever since you walked out
You left me with the blues
I never thought that it could end like this
If you would treat me this way
I never thought that I'd live to see
The day when you'd turn your back on me
I just can't seem to think straight
There's no way I can concentrate
Ever since you walked out
And you left me with the blues
Play some blues
I never thought that it would end like this
That you would treat me this way
I never thought that I'd live to see
The day when you'd turn your back on me
I just can't seem to think straight
There's just no way I can concentrate
Ever since you walked out
And left me with the blues
Ever since you walked out
And left me with the blues
Yeah, I wanna hear some more bluesEmbed
