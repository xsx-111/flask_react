Texas Strut LyricsOne, two, three, four!
Let me tell you about the Texas blues!
I went down south to Dallas
To hear those cowboys wail
Came across that Billy Gibbons
That ol' man ZZ trail
I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
The Texas blues
Got myself in double trouble
When I saw that Texas Flood
Stevie says the sky is crying
Superstitions in his blood
I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
The Texas blues
Howl, howl, howl, howl!
I heard that Houston Twister
Well, he can run you off the tracks
When he plays that cold cold feeling
You get the shivers down your back
I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
The Texas blues
Howl, howl, howl, howl!
Well, I'm going back to Dallas
Walk or waiting for your bus
Riding off into the sunset
You won't see my feet for dust
I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
Well I just can't lose with the Texas blues
The Texas blues
The Texas blues
Howl, howl, howl, howl!
Howl, howl, howl, howl!Embed
