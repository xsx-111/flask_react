Listen LyricsListen brothers, this has got a lot to do with you
And my sisters, it also does concern you too
You waste you time hanging around
With all those freaks out there in town
Not knowing, all the time
Ther laughing at you like a clown
Laughing at you like a clown
Can you see now, that time is right now, right now
No time to waste, my friend
You've got to act, now act now
Come around one day you'll see
People will treat it as their destiny
Its nothing so strange my friend
Only folks who wanna be just men
Only folks who wanna be just men
Ooo listen brothers, and my sisters
Listen brothers, eaw yea, and my sisters
Listen Brothers
Dont you think im trying to put you down
And my sisters
Dont want to see you treated like a bum
Get your minds, two can love
Doing what you know is right
You must make a stand one day
For its time you stop but think in flight
For its time you stop but think in flight
Can you see now
That time is right now, right now
No time to waste, my friend
You've got to act now, act now
Come around one day you'll see
People will treat it as their destiny
It's nothing to waste my friend
Only folks who wanna be just men
Only folks who wanna be just menEmbed
