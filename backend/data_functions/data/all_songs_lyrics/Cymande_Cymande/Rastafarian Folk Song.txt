Rastafarian Folk Song LyricsThis is a Rastafarian folk song
Dedicated to the world's first hippie
Hail Jah Rastafari
Hail Jah Rastafari
(Ahh, say the words, ahh, speak the words, speak the Words)
Behold how good and how pleasant it is
(Praise be, praise be)
For brethren to dwell together in unity
(Yes, Oh, praise to be to Rasta, true words brother
Say the words, true words, say the words, lord, say the words)
It is like the precious ointment upon the head
Which runneth down to the beard
(Oh, Oh, Oh,)
Even I-Man's beard
That went down to the skirt of I-Man's garments
(Praise, praise Rastafari, peace, peace and love)
When I was a scar faced man
Everybody know Fi me name
Now I am a bearded man
Nobody know Fi me name
Allah, Allah, Allah Allah Jah
Everybody know Fi me name
Only Babylon and them
Could ever know Fi me name
Speak brother
Peace and love is the message
Rastafari is bringing you this message
Yes
We don't need a Rastafari
Everybody know Fi me name
Kings of kings and lords of lords
Would ever know Fi me name
Allah, Allah, Allah Allah Jah
Everybody know Fi me name
Only Babylon and them
Could ever know Fi me name
Yes
Peace, peace my friend
Rastafari is bringing this message
Power to the people, power to the people
And right on, right on
Allah, Allah, Allah Allah Jah
Everybody know Fi me name
Only Babylon and them
Could ever know Fi me name
Allah, Allah, Allah Allah Jah
Everybody know Fi me name
Kings of kings and lords of lords
Could ever know Fi me nameEmbed
