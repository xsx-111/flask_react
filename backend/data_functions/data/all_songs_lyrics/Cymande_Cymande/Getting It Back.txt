Getting It Back LyricsI don't wanna feel down
Cause my name is getting around
I said the whole world is letting me down now
Cause I don't know where I'm bound

Yes I guess I'm going down down down
And I feel I'm gonna drown
Yeah I guess I'm going down down down
And I feel I'm gonna drown
Once I used to be high
Now all my friends pass me by
I got teardrops in my eye
Somebody else got all the smiles

Because I guess I'm going down down down
And I feel I'm gonna drown
Yeah I guess I'm going down down down
And I feel I'm gonna drown
Going down down down
Going down down down
Going down down down
Going down
Got to tell you now
Because I'm going down down down
Down down down
(?)
But how can I ride on
When I'm going down down down
Going down down down
Going going
(?)
Right down to the ground now
(?)
I need a little help now
