Mighty Heavy Load Lyrics
People have seen me
Said I'm changing fast
Worry shall have changed you
Since I saw you last
Blind man walking around
And has a dream
Seeking their goal
That they have never seen

A mighty heavy load
I've got to bear every road I travel
A might heavy load
That I've bore for centuries more (believe me now)
A mighty heavy load
I've got to bear every road I travel
A mighty heavy load
That I bore for centuries gone

(Yes, whoa)
We have waited for all of these
Precious words
Nothing spoken
Nothing heard
Innocent seeking
The time of change
Seems to pass
They must be out of range

A mighty heavy load
I've got to bear every road I travel
A might heavy load
That I've bore for centuries more (believe me now)
A mighty heavy load
I've got to bear every road I travel
A mighty heavy load
That I bore for centuries gone
A mighty heavy load
I've got to bear every road I travel
A might heavy load
That I've bore for centuries more (believe me now)
A mighty heavy load
I've got to bear every road I travel
A mighty heavy load
That I bore for centuries gone

Yes, tell them
I'm bearing a load
It's so heavy now
Hear me singin, oh man
I've got to know
That load's so heavy now
What a load
They hear me singin
Oh GodEmbed
