Bra LyricsTime has been lost in trying
We have been left outside
Looking at passions dying
Emotions grow strong all the time
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
They might have said we're lying
No matter how hard we try
Those that are watch them crying
So as the helpless die
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
Time has been lost in trying
We have been left outside
Looking at passions dying
Emotions grow stronger all the time
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
Alright still go on
Alright still go on
Alright still go on3Embed
