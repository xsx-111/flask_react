Monkeys LyricsI bagsy yours
If you'll bagsy mine
I'll take a chance
If you'll take the blame
Forget it
Forget it
Keymon
Keymon
Boys are the same
Brains in their pockets
Girls are the same
Knock it and rock it
Remember
Remember
Keymon
Keymon
I'm not a holy man
I'm too lowly for that
I'm not a praying man
I'm not ready for that
Keymon
Keymon
I bagsy yours
If you'll bagsy mine
I'll take a chance
If you'll take the blame
Forget it
Forget it
Keymon
