Going Up LyricsAin't thou watching my film
Analysing me
Rusty junker squawker
Shaking up to say
If we should pull
The plugs out, on our history
And all of history
Yeah
Things that shouldn't be
Things that couldn't be
No, things that had to be
Don't you see?
Don't you see?
It's going up up up
It's going up
It's going up up up
It's going up
Let's get the hell out of here
Let's get the hell out of here
Going up
Going down
D'you want to know what's wrong with the world?
Everywhere there's people with no flowers in their hair
Flowers in their hair
Flowers
D'you want to know what's wrong with the world?
Everywhere there's people with no flowers in their hair
Flowers in their hair
FlowersEmbed
