Crocodiles LyricsI read it in a magazine
I don't wanna see it again
I threw away the magazine
And looked for someone to explain
I don't wanna look back
I can't look around
I don't wanna see it coming round
Listen to the ups and downs
Listen to the sound they make
Don't be scared when it gets loud
When your skin begins to shake
'Cause you don't wanna look back
You gotta look tall
You gotta see those creeps crawl
I know you know
I know you know
I can see you've got the blues
In your alligator shoes
Me, I'm all smiles
I got my crocodiles
I don't wanna look back
I can't turn around
I don't want to see it coming down
Met someone just the other day
Said wait until tomorrow
I said, hey what you doing today
He said, I'm going to do it tomorrow
Met someone just the other day
Said wait until tomorrow
I said, hey, what you doing today
I'm going to do it tomorrowEmbed
