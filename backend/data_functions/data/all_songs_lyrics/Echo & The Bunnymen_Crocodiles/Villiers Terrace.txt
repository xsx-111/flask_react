Villiers Terrace LyricsI've been up to Villiers Terrace
To see what's a-happening
There's people rolling 'round on the carpet
Mixing up the medicine
I've been up to Villiers Terrace
I saw what's a-happening
People rolling 'round on the carpet
Biting wool and pulling string
You said people rolled on carpet
But I never thought they'd do those things
I've been up to Villiers Terrace
I've been in a daze for days
I drank some of the medici-i-i-ine
And I didn't like the taste
I've been up to Villiers Terrace
I've been in a daze for days
People rolling 'round on your carpet
Biting wool and pulling string
You said people rolled on carpet
But I never thought they'd do those things
Been up to Villiers Terrace
To see what's a-happening
People rolling 'round on the carpet
Passing 'round the medicine
Been up to Villiers Terrace
I saw what's a-happening
There's people rolling 'round on my carpet
Biting wool and pulling string
You said people rolled on carpet, boys
But I never thought they'd do those things
