Would you mind if we laugh at you
Do you mind if we sing with you

Make us proud of you
Do something we can't do
Do it, do it
Do it, do it
Do it

They hope I'm heading for a fall

Julie says
I think it's time you stopped stalling
We think it's time you start falling
Fall

D'you mind if we laugh at you
Mind if we sing with you
Daddy says
Brother says
Make us proud of you
Do something we can't do
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do itEmbed
