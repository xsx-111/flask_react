Stars Are Stars LyricsThe sky seems full
When you're in the cradle
The rain will fall
And wash your dreams
Stars are stars
And they shine so hard
Now you spit out the sky
Because it's empty and hollow
All your dreams
Are hanging out to dry
Stars are stars
And they shine so cold
I saw you climb
Shadows on the trees
We lost some time
After things that never matter
I caught that falling star
It cut my hands to pieces
Where did I put that box
That had my name in it
I saw you climb
Shadows on the trees
We lost some time
After things that never matter
The cogs have clicked and
The clocks will have their say
And they'll make another day
You came here late
You've gone home early
Who'll remember now
You've gone away
Gone away
Gone away1Embed
