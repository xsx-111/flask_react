The Hitman Lyrics
Here we go
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, I'm the hitman, stand aside
I'm the hitman, I want your life
Ain't no escaping, don't run and hide
There goes the neighborhood
(I'm gonna kill for your love)
That's right!

Hitman, now don't you cry
I'm just it, man, and you might get fried
Gun in my pocket, don't get me wrong
I'll be your hitman
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a head shredder
That's better!

Baby, baby, baby, I'm a hitman
Hitman, hitman (Yeah!)
Yeah, trouble in the East
Trouble in the West
Struggle with the beast
What a thief, what a pest
Come back mother
Nuke that sucker
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Who knows what I'm talking about?
Waste that brother
All right, ooh!
That's the way to do it, ah-ha!

I'm the hitman, I'm your prize
But this hitman
Can cut you down to size
Love me baby, don't be so cool
Love me, love me, baby
I've been to the hitman school
Yeah, yeah!
You're gonna make my day
Gonna blow you away

When the fun begins
(Hitman) Are you ready for the sting?
Gonna waste that thing
(Hitman) Hitman is king
Go, go, yeah, hitman, hitman
Oh yeah, ow!
