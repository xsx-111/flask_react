Delilah Lyrics
Delilah, Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You're irresistible
You make me smile
When I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope
You make me laugh and I like it
You get away with murder so innocent
But when you throw a moody
You're all claws and you bite
That's alright!

Delilah, Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You're unpredictable
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go
To sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over
My Chippendale suite

Delilah, Delilah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eye
Meeow meeow meeow
Delilah, I love you, Delilah
Ooh, you make me so very happy
You give me kisses
And I go out of my mind, ooh
Meeow meeow meeow
You're irresistible, I love you, Delilah
Delilah, I love you

Hah-hah
You make me very happy
Oh yeah
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your, your, your kisses
I love your kisses3Embed
