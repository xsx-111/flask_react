Steamer Trunk Lyrics
Why you turned out the way you did
That thunderstorm is still crashing in your cranium
Find that all these funny faces look the same
I know who's to blame, but I swore I wouldn't say

It's time that I got moving on
As you're still burning the dress you wore to senior prom
Trying to forget how you've been touched
I loved you so I told you, but it didn't matter much

And I'm trying to figure out
What you're all about
These days I don't have much to say to you
And I've been drunker than a skunk
Ever since the day I left you
With your darkest secret safely packed away up in my steamer trunk

Why I turned out the way I did
Someone somewhere dropped me on my cranium
I'm sorry, can you repeat what you just said?
My short term memory is gone, but my long term's far from dead
I'm trying to figure out
What you're all about these days
I don't have much to say to you
And I've been drunker than a skunk
Ever since the day I left you
With your darkest secret safely packed away up in my steamer trunk

I'm trying to figure out
What you're all about
These days I don't have much to say to you
And I've been swearing like a sailor
Ever since the day I left her
With your darkest secret safely packed away up in my steamer trunkEmbed
