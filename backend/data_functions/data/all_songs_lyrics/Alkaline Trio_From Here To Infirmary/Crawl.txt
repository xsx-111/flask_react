Crawl LyricsWaking up zeroed in on medicine
Am I waking up at all today?
Seeing lights, feeling pain, there's my cure on ice
I can walk but I will crawl there
I will crawl there
Sitting straight, feeling faint, an exhausted smile
Screens my words but I will hear them
Here's a phrase that we all know, but I can't make sense
I don't know words but I will hear them
I still hear them
Never ran away for the sake of scars
Tried not to move but she was armed
And shots were fired
Now a hole in the head of this wounded liar
Never had a drink that I didn't like
Got a taste of you, threw up all night
I got more sick
With every sour second rate kiss
Everything I never would miss again
Waking up, I'm zeroed in on medicine
Am I waking up at all today?
I'm seeing lights, feeling pain, there's my cure on ice
I can walk but I will crawl there
I will crawl there
Never ran away for the sake of scars
Tried not to move but she was armed
And shots were fired
Now there's a hole in the head of this wounded liar
Never had a drink that I didn't like
Got a taste of you, threw up all night
I got more sick
With every sour second rate kiss
Everything I never would miss again
Now I don't know, now I don't know
I don't know who your boyfriend isEmbed
