Trucks and Trains LyricsThese days go by like trucks and trains
Some hit so hard you barely feel a thing
Lights out right now, back then and forevermore
Lights out left now, these robots marching to the nearest liquor store
There's something green that's leaving town
Always thought it was blue, always knew I was wrong
Where it goes, hell knows maybe somewhere better than here
And what they say of the grass on the other sides true
Too much time looking up is turning everything blue
Including me, including you, including you
These times count down like boats and planes
Some wash away in undertow, some plummet down in flames
Lights out right now, back then and forevermore
With sirens on, this ambulance is racing to the west coast shore
There's something blue that's leaving town
We always talked about black, we're considering brown
Where it goes hell knows, maybe somewhere better than here
And what they say of the grass on the other sides true
Too much time looking up's turning everything blue
Including me, including the ocean, including you
Feel the ocean blue engulfing you
I view the deep blue sea
It's turning red right in front of me
There's something gray that's leaving town
And it's way beyond me how it gets off the ground
Where it goes hell knows, maybe somewhere better than here
And what they say of the grass on the other sides true
Too much time looking ups turning everything blue
Including me, including the pilots, including youEmbed
