Take Lots with Alcohol LyricsHello, what the hell am I doing here?
That's a really nice suit, this is a really comfortable chair
See, I don't know if you can help me or not
Cause I don't feel sick, no I don't feel sick
But the pains in my head have almost put me underground
I don't really care if I am healthy or not
Just clean my head up, doc, I'll give you anything you want
See, I don't know why I don't fall in love
Well, maybe I know why, and maybe you could make it stop
We'll cut it up and bury it and leave it underground
And I'll take to wishing and fall under sleeping safe and sound
Just give me medicine, prescribe me anything
Just knock me out and walk me through the door
Well I have no desire
To see through my own eyes anymore
Hello, what the hell are you doing here?
You made a really strange face, this is a really uncomfortable air
I see I'm boring you, maybe I bore myself too
That's why I need help, I'm cleaning blood off dusty shelves
I've been cut up in this room so many times it might take days
And those stress cracks in the wood, how nicely they soak up the stains
Just give me medicine, prescribe me anything
Just knock me out and walk me through the door
Well I have no desire
To see through my own eyes anymore
Been telling myself these jokes for so long, well so long
I'm a has-been who is heckled on the stage
Been telling myself these jokes for so long, well so long
I'm a has-been who is heckled on this stageEmbed
