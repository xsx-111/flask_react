Armageddon Lyrics
I wrote the words to this song on the back of a photograph
Behind your back it goes
A little something like this is way too big to miss
I got a letter in the mail
The sender failed to let me know where it came from
Opened it up and sure enough, there we were, arm in arm again

I know it's small but my last call's been called, half an hour ago
I know it's late but do you think you could at least fix it for me?
Then I'll go, I'll go alone
I swear I won't tell a soul
I'll drink this beer and write in fear of a song everybody hates

Armageddon, let the light in
Before we say goodbye, give us something to believe in
Armageddon, we're not begging
For too much, I don't think
Need a goodbye kiss before we sink

I wrote the words to this song on the back of a photograph
Behind your back it goes
A little something like this is way too big to miss
I got a letter in the mail
The sender failed to let me know where it came from
Opened it up and sure enough, there we were, up in arms again
Armageddon, let the light in
Before we say goodbye, give us something to believe in
Armageddon, we're not begging
For too much, I don't think
Need a goodbye kiss before we sink

We sink, we sink
We sink, we sink

Armageddon, let the light in
Before we say goodbye, give us something to believe in
Armageddon, we're not begging
For too much, I don't think
Need one last salute before we sink1Embed
