Bloodied Up LyricsYou don't say much of anything
When questioned of your whereabouts, your whereabouts
And I just can't see through the evidence
It's evident, it's right in front of me in black and white and red
And I don't believe in much of anything
I'm glad I have people I call friends
If it was up to me, I'd never have to miss you
It's for the better in the bitter end I guess you'd know the best
You have every right to be this appalled with me
Join the club, I signed up a long time ago and I know how you feel
And when you decked me, you left me knocked out on the floor
I came to bloodied up, but you weren't around
I picked my teeth off the ground like they'd been there before
You don't say much of anything
When questioned of your whereabouts, your whereabouts
And I just can't see through the evidence
It's evident, it's right fucking there in black and white and red
You have every right to be this appalled with me
Join the club, I signed up a long time ago and I know how you feel
And when you decked me, you left me knocked out on the floor
I came to bloodied up, but you weren't around
I picked my teeth off the ground like they'd been there before1Embed
