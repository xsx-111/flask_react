Another Innocent Girl LyricsHe likes to act like he's all grown up
He wanted to grow up to be
An actor, but he never told anybody
He likes to spill all of his guts
On the top of a well stocked bar
And then swallow them bit by bit
Remembering every scar
It's a valid reason for every drink
And a new tattoo is a new reason to think
He likes to pretend that he's all sewn up
It makes for a much stronger case
But there is blood underneath that skin
That scar is not so easy to erase
He walks with a glass cane now, he's careful
When holding his body up straight
Can't go outside anymore when it's raining
Can't smash up that beautiful face
Another innocent girl just made his list
That self pity shit is just too hard too resist
Yeah, when we get home, you'll see
That this part of him is now part of me
He likes to act like he's all grown up
He wanted to grow up to be
An actor, but he never told anybody
He likes to spill all of his guts
On the top of a well stocked bar
And then swallow them bit by bit
Remembering every scar
It's a valid reason for stronger drinks
And a new tattoo is a new reason to think
Yeah, when we get home, you'll see
That this part of him is controlling me
And it's way too easy to fake this smile
And lead you on
Maybe I'm wrong
Everyone gets bored once in awhileEmbed
