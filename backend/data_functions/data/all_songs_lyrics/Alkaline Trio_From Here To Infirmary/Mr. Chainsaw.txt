Mr. Chainsaw LyricsWhen was it that you lost your youth or traded
It for something more for them to use, so jaded
Why is it that you never said
I love you more than just a friend?
I pray this gridlock never ends
And when we get there just depends
I found out recently that you are leaving
For good I hope I softly tell my ceiling
It's better now to be alive
Sleeping is my 9 to 5
I'm having nightmares all the time
Of running out of words that rhyme
Everything that you could never say
Would never matter anyway
I took a hammer and two nails to my eardrums long ago
Before that steak knife took my eyes
I looked up to the sky
For the last thing I would ever see
For the last time I'd cry
When was it that you sold your life or wasted
Every bite of that small slice you never tasted?
I guess I should be one to talk
There's nights that I can't even walk
There's days I couldn't give a fuck
And in between is where I'm stuck
From blocks away I heard somebody screaming
That small child inside of you that you left bleeding
You stabbed him up not once but twice
Cubicles will now suffice
Some say it's the roll of the dice
I think they're wrong, I know I'm right
Every breath that I could barely breathe
Could barely make it past my teeth
I took a blowtorch to both of my lungs a long, long time ago
And every step that I could take
Is one more difficult to make
Mr. Chainsaw came and took my legs a long, long time ago
In case you're wondering, I'm singing about growing up, about giving in
In case you're wondering, I'm singing about growing up, about giving in
In case you're wondering, we're singing about growing up
About growing up and giving inEmbed
