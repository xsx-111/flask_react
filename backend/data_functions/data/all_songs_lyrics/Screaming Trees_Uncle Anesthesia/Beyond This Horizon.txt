Beyond This Horizon LyricsCount the miles before they pass you by
Shadow of the sun has crossed the sky
Fill your head with everything you find
Beyond, beyond this horizon
Beyond, beyond this horizon
Beyond, beyond this horizon
Somewhere in the valley where you lie
Pray for those whose sun will never rise
Ghosts are laughing everywhere you land
Take another step and then you can't
Beyond, beyond this horizon
Beyond, beyond this horizon
Beyond, beyond this horizon
Count the miles before they pass you by
Shadow of the sun has crossed the sky
Fill your head with everything you find
Beyond, beyond this horizonEmbed
