Uncle Anesthesia LyricsTries to preach us in the dark
By the river I hear you talking
Strike a match to Western sky
Blowing fire in the sweet sweet summertime
Alright
Eyes betray what your words don't speak
Burn my gaze with sadness turn your head away
I'd rather be almost anywhere else
A step away from madness
Oh
No man's promised land tell me what you may
Saw the moonlight waiting somewhere further on the way
Wrong turn to Jahannon and I wonder if you'd stay
No man

Just a preacher in the dark
By the river I hear you talking
Strike a match to the Western skies
Blowing fire in the sweetest summertime
Oh
No man's promised land tell me what you may
Saw the moonlight waiting somewhere further down the way
Wrong turn to Jahannon and I wonder if you'd stay
No man, no man, I wonder if you'll stay
Yeah, I wonder if you'll stay
I wonder if you'll speak
Yeah, wonder if, wonder if, wonder if
Wonder if you'll stay at home
Wonder if, wonder ifEmbed
