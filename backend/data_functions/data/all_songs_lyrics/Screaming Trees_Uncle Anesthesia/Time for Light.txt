Time for Light Lyrics
Where are you walking to?
There's a trapdoor straight ahead falling through
What are you gonna do, gonna do?

Visions of us on the wall
Sisters spellbound in the hall
House is dark and everybody's happy

Close my eyes to the dawn
There's a wheel of destruction coming on
It's all we never said, never said

Visions of us on the wall
Sisters spellbound in the hall
House is dark and everybody's happy

The time for light is over
Darkness drops you in deep
These are things we shouldn't let go, girl
Secrets that you should know
But it's alright
Yes, it's alright
Oh come on, it's alright
Didn't I say that it's alright?
As far as you know, it's alright
Where are you walking now?
Fate just set a trap coming down
Our heads are filled with all the things we used to hear
Everything never said, never said

Visions of us on the wall
Sisters spellbound in the hall
House is dark and everybody's happy
(Fuck the house)Embed
