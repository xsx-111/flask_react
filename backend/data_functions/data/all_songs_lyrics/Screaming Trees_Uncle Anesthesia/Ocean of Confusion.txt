Ocean of Confusion LyricsOn a day so long ago now, no one can remember
There's a chance this too will pass vanish in the haze
This is moving too far under the skin of your sight
Ocean of confusion took me back to the end of the night
Transparent dreams fade in my head and in my eye
I'm looking back for one last time
Make a dash towards the door in sudden disarray
As the daylight turned to rust
The more you want to stay
Trapped within the silence
And do you think it's alright
Close your eyes and try to fly
Back to the end of the night
Transparent dreams made in my head and in my eye
I'm looking back for one last time
Now day has broken, scattered in the wind
Lies still unspoken, nothing left to say
Sliding by a picture and then fold it in your hand
Ride it out in hopelessness, now you'll understand
This is moving too far under the skin of your sight
Ocean of confusion took me back to the end of the night
Transparent dreams made in my head and in my eye
I'm looking back for one last time ...time
Back to the end of the night ...nightEmbed
