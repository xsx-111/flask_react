Story of Her Fate LyricsDeep into my tears
Hold me under drownin' in despair
So many years, only place to hide
Where she could fly never in the sky
And I would not hesitate
To tell the story of her fate
In a storm was she dead or disappeared?
Or did she fly, never said, goodbye, goodbye?
Yep
Leaves have turned to gold
And all the trees have fallen to the ground
I can't explain, all along I knew
That she would fly but I think she's died
Goodbye, yeah, goodbyeEmbed
