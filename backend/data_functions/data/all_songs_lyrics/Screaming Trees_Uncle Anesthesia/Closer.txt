Closer Lyrics
Histories are held within your heart so let it go
Open all the doors around your eyes and let us know
Certain keys were held within your hand so let it show

Bring us closer to the flame
Bring us closer to the fire
Where's the spark within your eye?
Where is the spark?

Thunder in your ears until you can't hear this at all
Rivers flow in tears until your destiny's dissolved
Drifted through the years until a voice receives your call

Bring us closer to the fire
Bring us closer to the flame
The end and beginning are the same
It's all the same


Mysteries are kept within your heart so let it show
Open all the doors around your eyes and let us know
Certain keys were held until they must have let you go
Bring us closer to the flame
Bring us closer to the fire
This world can't take us any higher

Bring us closer to the, bring us closer to the fire
Oh yeah, yeah
Higher and higher and higher
Bring us higher and higher and higher
Bring us closer to the, bring us closer to the fire
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, no you can't
Higher and higher and higher
Bring us closer to the, bring us closer to the fire
Oh yeah-yeah, oh yeah-yeah, oh yeah-yeah
Oh yeah-yeah, oh yeah-yeah, oh yeah-yeah

Bring us closer to the, bring us closer to theEmbed
