Lay You Down LyricsNowhere is the soul I felt
Now I've lost my way
Nowhere is the place I've been
Promise not to stay
How it was and always is
Sometimes it never will begin
And it won't take very long (too long)
If you come around
If it all goes wrong
You can lay your head down
Nothing is inside the hollow shell I left behind
Nothing left of innocence
It's drifting with the tide
How It was and always is
Maybe it never will begin
And it won't take very long (too long)
If you come around
If it all goes wrong
You can lay your head downEmbed
