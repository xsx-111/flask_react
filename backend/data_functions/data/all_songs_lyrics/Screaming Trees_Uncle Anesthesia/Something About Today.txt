Something About Today LyricsGone so long and feeling so let down
Seems as though I'm living underground
There's something about today, I can't explain
Walked on burning bridges so I said
I think I'll take another way instead
There's something about today, I can't explain
War from sea to oily sea
Waves have washed home their disease
All the miles couldn't make it change
I might know tomorrow, not today
Chased by shaded nightmares till I'm dead
Following most everywhere I tread
There's something about today, I can't explain
There's something about todayEmbed
