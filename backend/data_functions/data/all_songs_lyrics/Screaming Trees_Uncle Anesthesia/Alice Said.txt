Alice Said LyricsAlice said to come on in now
It's time for bed
The hour's quite late
I need a nap to clear my head
Laid it down, the pillow softly calls to you and me
I've been sat down, bounced all around
Now I can't see, blind happily...
Alice said have you forgotten what we'll be
Concealed in smiles that come too late
Now I can't see
The sun goes down, thoughts go astray
She might take my soul away
Don't close the shades until the twilight fades
Yep!
Alice said to come on in now
It's time for bed
The hour's quite late
I need a nap to clear my head
The sun goes down, thoughts go astray
She might take my soul away
Don't close the shades until the twilight fades
Don't close the shades until the twilight fades
Alice said...(repeat to fade)Embed
