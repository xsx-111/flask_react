Disappearing LyricsDon't you try to find me anymore
I want to stay outside of your world this time
We've thrown it all away
That was one mistake I never thought you'd make
Once you loved the path that has no end
Close the door and think a while
And you are all alone
Staring into nothingness
Your eyes'll turn to stone
Return to yesterday, there is no easy way
Once you walked away but now you stay, yeah
Faded out are memories
And moments that you took
Locked away inside a box
Never thought you would follow it down and back
Disappear in your own tracks
Don't you think you've had enough of thatEmbed
