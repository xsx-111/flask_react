Bed of Roses LyricsWhere do you stand when it's all over
Washed from the earth and down to the sea
Do you lie in a bed of roses
Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it now
I see your shadow knocking at my door
All plastic face and shaking hands
Now how much space could ever hold you here
Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it now
Where do you stand when it's all over
Washed from the earth and down to the sea
Do you lie in a bed of roses
Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it now
Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it nowEmbed
