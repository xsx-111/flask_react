Caught Between LyricsWhen you walked into the room
Never seen your face up here
On the ground with all that crawls
To your head before the dawn
Now I'm caught between and tired of all this pain
Holds you under but the shadows still remain
Voices tap you from behind
Did one say that I was wrong
Go ahead and blind yourself
Feeling never will be gone
Now I'm caught between and tired of all this pain
Holds you under but the shadows still remain
Time has taken me down from my pedestal
Then you walked into the room
Never seen your face before
Close my eyes and see the sky
Won't follow you there anymore
Now I'm caught between and tired of all this pain
Holds you under but the shadows still remain
Time has taken me down
It's taken me down, way down there
You know that it's taken me
Oh, I said, "Lord, don't take me"
And now it's taken me down
Down by the ground now
Woah, yeah yeahEmbed
