I Can Be a Frog Lyrics
She said I can be a frog
I can be a bat
I can be a bear
I can be a cat
She said I can be a lion
I can be a Gila monster
I can be a warrior Indian
I can be a helicopter
She said I can be a wolf
I can be a finch
I can be a jaguar
Or a locust on a branch
She said I can be a monkey
I can be a tiger
I can be a tornado
Knocking down your wires

Well, it seems like she can be anything
Any kind of creature she wants to be
Oh, it seams like she can be anything
Any kind of frog
Any kind of bear
Any kind of monkey
She wants to beEmbed
