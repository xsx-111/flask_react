What Does It Mean? Lyrics
You and me, we've lit our fuse
I don't care if we're born to lose
Going to infinity
Out all night, sun's too bright
Though I'm blind, it'll be all right
Going to infinity

What does it mean
Infinity

You and me, we've lit our fuse
I don't care if we're born to lose
Going to infinity
Out all night, the sun's too bright
Though I'm blind, it'll be all right
Going to infinity


You and me know it ends too soon
But I know we've got a death wish too
Going to infinity
Out all night, we're burning away
I'm left tired and I sleep for days
Going to infinity


You and me know it ends too soon
But I know we've got a death wish too
Going to infinity
Out all night, we're burning away
I'm left tired and I sleep for days
We're going to infinity
