Just Above Love Lyrics
There is something just above love
And that's what she hears, and that's where she is
I don't know how people
Arrive at themselves

Sometimes you can hear them trying
They're trying for something a little bit harder
It's high and they're already high
It's high, it's higher than they are

It's high, and they're already high
It's high, and it's higher than they are
But they're going for something that's just above love
And that's where she is, and that's where she lives

There is something just above love
And that's what she hears, and that's what she hears
And that's where she lives, and that's where she is
And that's where she isEmbed
