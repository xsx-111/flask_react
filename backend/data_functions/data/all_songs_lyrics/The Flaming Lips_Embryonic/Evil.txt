Evil Lyrics
I wish I could go back
Go back in time
I wish I could go back
Back in time
I would've warned you
Those people are evil
And it's hard to understand
I'll never understand

I wish I could go back
Go back in time
But no one ever really can
Go back in time
I would have shown you
Those people are evil
And they'll hurt you if they can
I'll never understand
Understand

I'll never understandEmbed
