Virgo Self-Esteem Broadcast LyricsYou think the forces have control
Well, there are no forces
And they have no control
Yes, it's just you and me
We fear anything that looks like the sun
And we, by our own design are helpless
This is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginning
This is the beginningEmbed
