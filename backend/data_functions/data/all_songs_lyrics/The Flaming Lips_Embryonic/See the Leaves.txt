See the Leaves Lyrics
Without hope
Without love
She sees herself
From below and above
Her untied hand
She smears the spit
Pleasure and suffering
Her beliefs conflict

It brings a smile
She cannot pretend
To believe that life
Really has no end

See the leaves
They're dying again
See the moth
It's flying again
See the leaves
They're dying again
See the moth
It's flying again
It's trying again
It's trying again
It's trying again
It's trying againEmbed
