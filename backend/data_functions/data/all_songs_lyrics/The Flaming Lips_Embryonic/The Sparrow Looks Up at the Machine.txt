The Sparrow Looks Up at the Machine LyricsWhat
What does it mean?
To dream what you dream
To believe what you see
Why
Why do we fear
To try to fly near
Underneath the machine
What
What does it mean?
To dream what you dream
To believe what you see
Why
Why do we fear
To try to fly near
Just beneath the machine
Just beneath the machine
Just beneath the machine
Just beneath the machine
Just beneath the machineEmbed
