Powerless Lyrics
Honey, you're just paranoid
You should do what you enjoy
No one is ever really powerless
That's what she said and she gave me a kiss
No one is ever really powerless
Now I think I know what that really is

It only happens if you try
Pain and pleasure both get you high
No one is ever really powerless
That's what she said, now I can't forget
No one is ever really powerless
No I think I know what that really isEmbed
