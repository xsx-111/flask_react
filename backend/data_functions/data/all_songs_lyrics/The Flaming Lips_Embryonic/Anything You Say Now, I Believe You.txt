Anything You Say Now, I Believe You Lyrics
I used to wonder, oh
What was life
I used to wonder, oh
What was truth
I just asked a perfect kind of question
Know I know the way the sky gets blue

Anything you say now I believe
Anything you say now I believe

I used to wonder, oh
How long is the sun
And why we are crushed to death by the moon
Now you showed me how the space is full of them
And there isn't anything I can do

Anything you say now I believe
Anything you say nowEmbed
