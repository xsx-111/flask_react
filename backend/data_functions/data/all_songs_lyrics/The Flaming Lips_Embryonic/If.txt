If Lyrics
People are evil, it's true
But on the other side
They can be gentle too
If they decide

But they don't always decide
We live on the impulses
Love is powerful
But not as powerful as evil

People are evil, it's true
But on the other side
They can be gentle too
If they decide

They decideEmbed
