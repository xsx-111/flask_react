Worm Mountain Lyrics
When you try
You will see
When you fail
You will be
Up on the mountain
But down in a hole
Only nature
Has control

When you run
You will hear
Through the mist
A bell rings clear
But the ring
Is just a sound
Of your starburn
Burning out

On the mountain
Way up high
There are worms
With diamond eyes
When you squeeze them
It makes a light
Through the forest
When you're blind1Embed
