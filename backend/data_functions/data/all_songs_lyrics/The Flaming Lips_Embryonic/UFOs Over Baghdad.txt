UFOs Over Baghdad Lyrics
I saw them coming
Landing softly in the sand
Come to land, a loving hand

I saw them landing
Sending sparks like falling snow
Heard their trumpets, peace blown

And what I saw forever changed me
From what I was before
These are beings who came from far, far away
To change the mind of war

I saw them coming
And I saw, in their eyes
Saw new kind of love I didn't recognize
Some kind of loveEmbed
