Silver Trembling Hands Lyrics
She keeps feeling for the blindfold
She keeps wishing for the secret society to fall
She keeps watching for the jaguar
With a silver trembling hand
Dagger
Night
Fight
Tomorrow
She forgets about the fear

When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high

She puts diamonds on her forehead
They remind her how the animals and trees and insects call
Is it wrong not to believe
Nature makes us all complete
Daggers
Night
Fight
Tomorrow
She forgets about the fear
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's highEmbed
