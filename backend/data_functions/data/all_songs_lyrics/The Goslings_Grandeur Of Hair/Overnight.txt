Overnight LyricsIt's a gate
Better open wide
It's a gate color of a red line
It's a scared line
Alright I've had a broken headlight
And I'm on a deadline and I
Saddest mother in the breadline
Can you see some strange black arriving
Sticking around somehow surviving
I rise I rise I'm rising out the window
I'm rising out the window I rise
I'm rising out the window I'm riding
Out the window
Glass eyeEmbed
