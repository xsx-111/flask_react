Haruspex LyricsIn my life, I have seen
The sky writing down
The tale of God's love
In the hair of the sun
In the stars, we were young, all new
There it is, some right arm
Taking on what is
What is doubt
And in life, when I'm gone
I'll be far, far too rich
To bear this gift
Someone please bring me back
Solid are the mighty
Forward are the meek
Take two sticks and rub together
Feet are walking on the sleek
Never saw the change of guard
In seasons shallow cheek...Embed
