Hundred Lyrics
The how I can't recall
But I'm staring at what once was the wall
Separating east and west
Now they meet amidst the broad daylight

So this is where you are, and this is where I am
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred

It's hard I must confess
I'm banking on the rest to clear away
'Cause we have spoken everything
Everything short of I love you

You, right where you are, from right where I am
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred

And who's to say it's wrong?
And who's to say that it's not right?
Where we should be for now?
So this is where you are, and this is where I am
So this is where you are, and this is where I've been
And this is where I've been
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred2Embed
