Dead Wrong Lyrics
If only I knew what I know
I'd make it a point to say so
To everyone that got me here
And everyone that made it

Clear I was dead wrong all along
You said it for my sake
That I would not lose my way
When I was astray

I'm doing the best that I could
Trying my best to be understood
Maybe I'm changing slowly
I'd get out, turn around if only I

Knew I was dead wrong all along
You said it for my sake
That I would not lose my way
When I was dead wrong all along

Mine is not a new story
Mine is not a new story
Mine is nothing new
But it is for me
So I was dead wrong all along
You said it for my sake
You thought I'd lost my way
When I was dead wrong all along
You said it for my sake
That I would not lose my way

Did I really lose my way?
Or are you afraid?4Embed
