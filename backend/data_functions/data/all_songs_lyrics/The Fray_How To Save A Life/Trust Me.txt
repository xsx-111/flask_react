Trust Me Lyrics
Looking for something I've never seen
Alone and I'm in-between
The place that I'm from and the place that I'm in
A city I've never been
I found a friend or should I say foe
Said there's a few things you should know
We don't want you to see, we come and we go
Here today, gone tomorrow

We're only taking turns
Holding this world
It's how it's always been
When you're older, you will understand

If I say who I know, it just goes to show
You need me less than I need you
Take it from me, we don't give sympathy
You can trust me, trust nobody
But I said you and me, we don't have honesty
The things we don't wanna speak
I'll try to get out, but I never will
Traffic is perfectly still
We're only taking turns
Holding this world
It's how it's always been
When you're older, you will understand

And then again, maybe you don't
And then again, maybe you won't

When you're older, you might understand
When you're older, you might understand2Embed
