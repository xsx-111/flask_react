Water with the Wine LyricsMet him on a Monday
And he said he loved me so
Walked me to my door
Before I knew it to my living room
I thought there was no need for worry
When he took me in his arms
Drank some whisky
Hung his coat upon the stand
That's when the music started
I heard the light switch click
I stumbled on a lost shoe
The fever's starting
This man was getting hot
I got no strength to make him stop
I guess it's too late
But I'll know next time
To mix some water with the wine
The sun came pouring in at five
Upon my face
I felt the taste of last night's love
Upon my lips
I wasn't sure if I had dreamt it
Or had not
But there across the pillow was the face
I had forgot
That's when he said he loved me
Could be the truth this time
He put his arms about me
Fever's starting
This man was getting hot
I got no strength to make him stop
I guess it's too late
But I'll know next time
To mix some water with the wineEmbed
