Save Me LyricsSinking
Caught up in a whirling motion
Such a strange sensation
The currents uncertain
Like sails of a mill
I spin
Like wheels I move in a circle
While you stand on the bank
Immune or evasive
Throw me a lifeline
Save me...
Intimacy and affection
Frozen
In this game of chance
I forfeit
Full hand of love
With no counters
Like a moth
With no flame
To persuade me
Like blood in the rain
Running thin
While you stand on the inside
Looking in
Save me...
Inside looking in
Complete in yourself
Throw me a lifeline
Save me...
Stand on the bank
Immune or evasive
Throw me a lifeline
Save me...Embed
