Like Fire LyricsI'm trembling
You got the touch
I'm under
And you got the power
When I feel your body next to mine
I know everything is gonna be all right
Hey, I'm trembling
I'm all on edge
I'm under
And you've got the power
You can be fire
Or sugar sweet like honey
Like honey
When you wanna be
When you're around me
It's like the sun up above
You may be fooling
But I'm deep in love
Let's stay together
That's how it should be
I'll only leave
If you leave me
I'm walking
I'm in the air
Who needs money
To ease the care
All it takes is just one kiss
Just one kiss will buy off a million tears
I'm walking
I'm in the air
You can be fire
Or sugar sweet like honey
Like honey
When you wanna be
I'm walking
I'm in the air
When I hear you call my name
Gives me the feeling that I love so much
I'm under
You've got the power
I'm under
You've got the power
Call me on the telephone
Just to say you love me and how muchEmbed
