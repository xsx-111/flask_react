Somebody Who Loves You LyricsI don't know what you're thinking
Should I stay or say goodbye
You blow smoke on the ceiling
You don't wanna look into my eyes
You've got somebody who loves you
But now I wanna see you fan the fire
Wrap the sheets around you
With me hugged up inside
I wanna see you fan the fire
Come on stoke the blaze
And don't run for cover
You've got somebody who loves you
Somebody loves you
You've got somebody who loves you
Somebody loves you
Cozy corner your arms around you
So tired of one night stands
Left with longing from misspent passion
With one more human to despise
You've got somebody who loves you
Don't mine for gold in the dim lit cafes
And as the gypsy once foretold
Love is dark but no stranger
Mistaken shyness can be costly
Too hasty a goodbye
Then you've lost me
You've got somebody who loves you
Somebody loves you
I wanna see you fan the fire
Come on stoke the blaze
And don't run for cover
Mistaken shyness can be costly
Too hasty a goodbye
Then you've lost meEmbed
