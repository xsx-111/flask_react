Help Yourself LyricsIf you're gonna do it do it right
Don't leave it overnight
If you're gonna help me help me now
Another ten minutes will be too late
Like a crying child
I need comfort now
Don't pick me up
When the tears are dry on my face
Need someone to help me
But not you, you're not ready
Seems you have trouble helping yourself
It takes time to notice
But you don't seem to know time keeps moving
What you're doing is wasting my time
You would help me more
Help me more if you helped yourself
Help yourself
Help yourself
You wanna get yourself together
Don't you wanna put yourself to right
I said get yourself together
Don't you wanna put yourself to right
I said no, don't apologise
You've done your best
Seems it still ain't right
Leave me alone
No more to be said
To get it right you got to do it yourself
I'm going out to help myself
Help myself
Help myself
I'm going out to help myself
Help myself
Help myself
If you're gonna say it say it now
Don't leave it overnight
If you're gonna hold me hold me tight
I don't wanna leave
Not if it seems all right
Like a crying child
I need comfort now
Don't pick me up
When the tears are dry on my face
You've got to govern the situation
Nut not you, you're no
And anyway, hold up
Hold up
Hold up
You're trying to sort out your mind
You've got to get it together
You've got to get it together
It would help me more
Help more if you helped yourselfEmbed
