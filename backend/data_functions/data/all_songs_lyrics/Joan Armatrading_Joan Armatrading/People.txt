People LyricsPeople to the left of me
People to the right
I wanna be alone
But it just gets worse all the time
Can't make it work
People all around me
In love, in pain
Some are integrated
Driving me insane
They're gonna drive me right out of my head
Scheming
There's people cheating
Pressure from all sides
Chain you
They'll try to change you
There's no escaping
People
People
People
Standing right in front of me
Moving up behind
Ringing on my phone
I got no place to hide
Nowhere to go
People all around me
Singing out of tune
Draw me, don't trace you
Oh leave me alone
I gotta find somewhere else I can go
Once I wanted loving
Somebody of my own
That's all changed
Love somebody of my own
That's all changed
People all around me
In love, in pain
Some are integrated
Driving me insane
They're gonna drive me right out of my head
People
