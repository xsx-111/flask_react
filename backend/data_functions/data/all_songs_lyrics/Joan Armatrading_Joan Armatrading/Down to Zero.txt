Down to Zero LyricsOh the feeling
When you're reeling
You step lightly thinking you're number one
Down to zero with a word leaving
For another one
Now you won't put you're feet back on the ground
Down to the ground
Down to the ground
Down to the ground
Down to the ground
Brand new dandy
First class scene stealer
Walks through the crowd and takes your man
Sends you rushing to the mirror
Brush your eyebrows and say
"There's more beauty in you than anyone"
Oh, remember who walked the warm sand beside you
Moored to your heel let the waves come rushing in
She took the worry from your head
But then again
She put trouble in your heart instead
And you fall
Down to the ground
Down to the ground
You'll know heartache
Still more crying when you're thinking of your mother's only son
Take to your bed
You say there's peace in sleep
But you dream of love instead
Oh, the heartache you'll find
Can bring more pain than a blistering sun
But oh when you fall
Oh when you fall
Fall at my door
Oh the feeling
When you're reeling
You step lightly thinking you're number one
Down to zero with a word leaving
For another one
Now you won't put you're feet back on the ground
Down to the ground
Down to the ground
Down to the ground
Down to the ground
You'll know heartache
Still more crying when you're thinking of your mother's only son
Take to your bed
You say there's peace in sleep
But you dream of love instead
But oh when you fall
Oh when you fall
Fall at my doorEmbed
