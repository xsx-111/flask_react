Tall in the Saddle LyricsSay what you will
You can't take the stars at night
Take your love
But that doesn't stop my life
You've been fooling around
I looked to you for love
Thought you walked on holy ground
But oh, you're mean
I thought that here
Was a guy, brave and strong
A brother to his brothers
Brave ans strong
Was preaching what to practice
But that don't mean a thing
You're mean
Tall in the saddle
One of these days you're gonna have to dismount
You don't leave me downhearted
But I'm sorry that you had to go
'Cos we had fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun
We had fun while it lasted
We had fun while it lasted
You were God's gift to girls
You persuaded
Then you beat up on their hearts
You made it, you made it
You made it, you made it
Oh you're just mean
Tall in the saddle
One of these days you're gonna have to dismount
You don't leave me downhearted
But I'm sorry that you had to go
'Cos we had fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun
We had fun while it lasted
We had fun while it lastedEmbed
