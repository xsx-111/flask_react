Never Give Up LyricsI'm a mine of information
I'm a stranger to the cause
I been watchin' you watchin' me babe
But the words I had are lost
Just wanna go down to be found
Wanna rise up in your flat
I wanna be everything you need babe
And I'm begging you to say in my heart
A room with a view
There's only a fool there
I will never give up , never give up , never give up
I will never give up , never give up , never give up
I will follow you home
How can you turn me away
Did you ever get hungry or thirsty
With a dream to satisfy
You don't wanna be safe from being lonely
But you're throat is kinda dry
Did you ever get senseless or defenseless
An exception to the rule
Ain't nobody pushin' you but you're rushin' in
And I'm beggin' you to stay in my heart
Whatever it takes to make you belong there
I will never give up , never give up , never give up
I will never give up , never give up , never give up
Love knows no other way
Being together and hearing you say you'll be mine
You're my world
And I'll be forever yours
Did you ever get hungry or thirsty
With a dream to satisfy
You don't wanna be safe from bein' lonely
But you're throat is kinda dry
Did you ever get senseless or defenseless
An exception to the rule
Ain't nobody pushin you but you're rushin' in
And I'm beggin' you to stay in my heart
A room with a view
There's only a fool there
I will never give up , never give up , never give up
I will never give up , never give up , never give up
I will follow you home
How can you turn me away
I will never give up , never give up , never give up
I will never give up , never give up , never give up
I will follow you home
How can you turn me awayEmbed
