Life Story LyricsDon't wanna stay here
Not very nice
You boiled me over
Now you're cold as ice
From what you gave me
To what you made me
I should be homeward bound
Why am I hanging 'round
Knowing your life story began with somebody else
Find your glory out there with somebody else
I'll be where you find me
I'll be somebody else
Somebody else
Dog in the manger
Teller of lies
I see a stranger laughing in your eyes
Though I don't know how
I'm in the way now
No matter what you do
I go on loving you
Knowing your life story began with somebody else
Find your glory out there with somebody else
I'll be where you find me
I'll be somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else
Deeper than your valleys
Longer than your memory
I go to your stories end
Your life story began with somebody else
Find your glory out there with somebody else
I'll be where you find me
I'll be somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody elseEmbed
