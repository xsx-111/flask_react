Promises LyricsHere by my side
Are you close enough to take me to your paradise
Or am I going down to my loneliness
Could you be loving me more or less
Do you know
Are you ready for the feeling
Can you learn to grow
Out in a world of tears we
We were hanging on
We come together
We find the sun
You all over me, all over
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Promises to be there
Promises to be there
Life, where the few may not ever find a heaven
I could be with you
Out in a world where nights
Tthey don't ever end
We got each other my love
My life, my friend
You all over me, all over
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Promises to love me
Promises to love me
Out in a world where nights
They don't ever ever end
We've got each other my love
My life, my friend
You all over me, all over
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Promises to be there
Promises to be there
Yeah...yeah...yeah
(Die away)
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Promises...
Promises...
Promises...
Promises...
(promises to be there
Promises to be there)
Promises to be there
Promises
Promises to be there
Promises
Promises to be there
