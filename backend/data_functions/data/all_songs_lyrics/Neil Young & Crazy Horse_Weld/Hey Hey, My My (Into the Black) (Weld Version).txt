Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) (Weld Version) LyricsHey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my

Out of the blue and into the black
Thay give you this but you pay for that
And once you're gone, you can't come back
When you're out of the blue and into the blaaaack


The King is gone, but he's not forgotten (Johnny Rotten, Johnny Rotten)
Is this the story of Johnny Rotten? (Johnny Rotten, Johnny, Rotten Johnny Wuhuuuu)
It's better to burn out, then to fade awaaaaaaay
The king is gone, but he's not forgotten


Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll will never die
There's more to the picture than meets the IIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Hey hey, my myEmbed
