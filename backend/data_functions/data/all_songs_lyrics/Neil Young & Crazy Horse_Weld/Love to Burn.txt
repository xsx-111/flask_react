Love to Burn Lyrics
Late one night I was walking in the valley of hearts
A spirit came to me and said: You gotta move to start
You gotta take the first step
You gotta grow to be tall
And then she me told something, something that I'll never forget

You got love to burn
You better take your chance on love
You got to let your guard down
You better take a chance
A chance on love (On Love)

Take chance on love
On love
On love
On love


In the valley of hearts there's a house full of broken windows
And the lovers inside just quarrel all the time
Why'd you ruin my life?
Where you takin' my kid?
And they hold each other saying: How did it come to this?
You got love to burn
You better take your chance on love
You got to let your guard down
You better take a chance
A chance on love (On love)

Take chance on love (On love)
Take chance on love (On love)
On love


Late one night I was walking in the valley of hearts
A spirit came to me and said: You gotta move to start
You gotta take the first step
You gotta grow to be tall
And then she me told something, something that I'll never forget

You got love to burn
You better take your chance on love
You got to let your guard down
You better take a chance
A chance on love (On love)
Chance on love (On love)
On love
On love
