Love and Only Love LyricsLong ago in the book of old
Before the chapter where dreams unfold
A battle raged on the open page
Love was a winner there overcoming hate
Like a little girl who couldn't wait
Love and only love will endure
Hate is everything you think it is
Love and only love will break it down
Love and only love, will break it down
Break it down, break it down
Tomorrow is a long long time if you're a memory
Trying to find peace of mind
Spirit come back to me
Give me strength and set me free
Let me hear the magic in my heart
Love and only love will endure
Hate is everything you think it is
Love and only love will break it down
Love and only love, will break it down
Break it down, break it down
Long ago in the book of old
Before the chapter where dreams unfold
A battle raged on the open page
Love was a winner there overcoming hate
Like a little girl who couldn't wait
Love and only love will endure
Hate is everything you think it is
Love and only love will break it down
