Farmer John (Weld Version) LyricsFarmer John, - I'm in love with your daughter 
Yeah the one, - with the champagne eyes 
I love the way she walks, i love the way she talks
I love the way she wiggles, she wiggles when she walks
Farmer John, - I'm in love with your daughter 
Yeah the one, with the champagne eyes
I love the way she walks, I love the way she talks
I love the way she moves, she moves, she moves
Farmer John, I'm in love with your daughter   
Solo
Farmer John,  I'm in love with your daughter  
Yeah the one, with the champagne eyes
I love the way she walks, I love the way she talks
I love the way she moves, she moves, she moves, moves
Farmer John ..
