Roll Another Number (Weld Version) Lyrics
It's too dark to put the keys in my ignition
And the morning sun is yet to climb my hood ornament
But before too long I might see those flashing red lights
Look out, mama - Because I'm coming home tonight

Think I'll roll another number for the road 
I feel able to get under any load 
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standing on the sound
Of this open-harded people going down

I'm not going back to Woodstock for a whiiiiiiile
Though I long to see that lonesome hippie girl smile
I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day
No, I don't believe
I'll be going back that waaaaay

Think I'll roll another number for the road 
I feel able to get under any load 
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standing on the sound
Of this open-harded people going down
Think I'll roll another number for the 
I feel able to get under any load 
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standing on the sound
Of this open-harded people going down
Think I'll roll another number for the roooooaaaaadEmbed
