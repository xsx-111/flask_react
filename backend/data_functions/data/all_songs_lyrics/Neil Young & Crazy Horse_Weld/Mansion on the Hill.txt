Mansion on the Hill LyricsWell, I saw an old man walkin' in my place
When he looked at me, it could've been my face
His words were kind but his eyes were wild
He said "I got loath to love, but I want one more child"
There's a mansion on the hill
Psychedelic music fills the air
Peace and love live there still
In that mansion on the hill
Around the next bend, take the highway to the sun
Or the rocky road, it really don't matter which one
I was in hurry but that don't matter now
'Cause I had to get off of that road of tears somehow
There's a mansion on the hill
Psychedelic music fills the air
Peace and love live there still
In that mansion on the hillEmbed
