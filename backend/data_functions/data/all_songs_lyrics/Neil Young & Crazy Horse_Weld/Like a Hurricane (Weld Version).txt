Like a Hurricane (Weld Version) LyricsOnce I thought I saw you
In a crowded hazy bar
Dancing on the light
From star to star
Far across the moonbeam
I know that's who you are
I saw your brown eyes
Turning once to fire

You are like a hurricane
There's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
To somewhere safer
Where the feeling stays
I want to love you but
I'm getting blown away

I am just a dreamer
But you are just a dream
You could have been
Anyone to me
Before that moment
You touched my lips
That perfect feeling
When time just slips
Away bеtween us
On our foggy trip

You are like a hurricane
Thеre's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
To somewhere safer
Where the feeling stays
I want to love you but
I'm getting blown away

Once I thought I saw you
In a crowded hazy bar
Dancing on the light
From star to star
Far across the moonbeam
I know that's who you are
I saw your brown eyes
Turning once to fire
You are like a hurricane
There's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
To somewhere safer
Where the feeling stays
I want to love you but
I'm getting blown away
