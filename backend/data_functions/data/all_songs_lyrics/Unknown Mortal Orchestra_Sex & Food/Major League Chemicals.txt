Major League Chemicals Lyrics
She wanted to find a way
To be someone else for a day
Major league chemicals make her grave
Miracles in a bathroom stall

She knows, she knows, she knows
Major league chemicals
She knows, she knows, she knows
Major league chemicals

She wanted to find a way
To be someone else for a day
Major league chemicals make her grave
Miracles in a bathroom stall

She knows, she knows, she knows
Major league chemicals
She knows, she knows, she knows
Major league chemicals

She knows, she knows, she knows
Major league chemicals
She knows, she knows, she knows
Major league chemicalsEmbed
