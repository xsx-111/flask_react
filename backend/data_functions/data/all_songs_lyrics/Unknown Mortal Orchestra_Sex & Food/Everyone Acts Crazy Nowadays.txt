Everyone Acts Crazy Nowadays Lyrics
I'm caught beyond the feeling I won't live far beyond this
I'm caught beyond the feeling I won't live far beyond these years
We're growing in a vicious garden
We don't complain or nothing
Did you hear that sound? Silence
Kinda jumpy now
Backwards despite this feeling
Backwards despite this feeling

I'm caught beyond the feeling I won't live far beyond this
I'm caught beyond the feeling I won't live far beyond these years
We're growing in a vicious garden
We don't complain or nothing
Did you hear that sound? Mayday
Gonna chop it down
Forward despite this feeling
Forward despite this feeling

Everyone acts crazy nowadays
Everyone acts crazy now
But we are taking all kinds of shit
Taking all kinds of shit
Everyone acts crazy nowadays
Everyone acts crazy now
But we are taking all kinds of shit
Taking all kinds of shit
I'm caught, beyond the feeling I won't live far beyond this
I'm caught, beyond the feeling I won't live far beyond these years
We're growing in a vicious garden
We don't complain or nothing
Did you hear that sound? Mayday
Gonna chop it down
Forward despite this feeling
Forward despite this feeling

Everyone acts crazy nowadays
Everyone acts crazy now
But we are taking all kinds of shit
Taking all kinds of shit
Everyone acts crazy nowadays
Everyone acts crazy now
But we are taking all kinds of shit
Taking all kinds of shit5Embed
