How Many Zeros Lyrics
Topless with the top down
How many zeros do you need?
Through the territory of fear
How many zeros do you need?

Sometimes bruises equal memories
Pulled towards that love like gravity
Sometimes bruises equal memories
Pulled towards that love like gravity

Work like an illusion
How many zeros do you need?
Freud auto-correction
How many zeros do you need?

Sometimes bruises equal memories
Pulled towards that love like gravity
Sometimes bruises equal memories
Pulled towards that love like gravity

La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-laEmbed
