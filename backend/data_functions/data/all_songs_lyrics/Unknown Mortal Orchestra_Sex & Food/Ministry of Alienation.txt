Ministry of Alienation Lyrics
Amoral, but not evil
Sick of fake democracies
No one will fuck the ugly robot
Samael owns history

My thinking is done by your machine
Can't escape the 20th century
Handing in my resignation
At the Ministry of Alienation

Not heaven, just California
Escape with you or from it all
Terraform a hostile wasteland
Like the rapture in reverse

My thinking is done by your machine
Can't escape the 20th century
Handing in my resignation
At the Ministry of Alienation2Embed
