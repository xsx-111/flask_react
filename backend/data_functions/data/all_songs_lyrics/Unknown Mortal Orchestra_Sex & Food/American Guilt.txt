American Guilt Lyrics
Tape over the camera
No more utopian videos
Eyes painted on eyelids
Viva la Mexico

No
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh

Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt
Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt
Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt
Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt

Land of the expensive
Even the Nazis are crying
History's private property
Viva la Mexico
No
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh

Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt
Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt
Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt
Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt

Tape over the camera
No more utopian videos
Eyes painted on eyelids
Viva la Mexico

No
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh
Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt
Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt
Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt
Oh no, here it comes, the American guilt13Embed
