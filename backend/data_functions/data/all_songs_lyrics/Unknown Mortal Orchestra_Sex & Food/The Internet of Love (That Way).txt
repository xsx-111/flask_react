The Internet of Love (That Way) Lyrics
I wake up alone
Do you wake up with someone else?

Only you could love me
Only you could love me
That way
That way
That way
That way

Awoke with long fingernails
In the internet of love

Only you could love me
Only you could love me
That way
That way
That way
That way

I helped you raise
Our imaginary child
Only you could love me
Only you could love me
That way
That way
That way
That way1Embed
