Hunnybee Lyrics
Warm rain and thunder
Days are getting darker
A week is such a long time
Eras rot like nature
Age of paranoia
Don't be such a modern stranger
Oh angel

Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting

Of heaven, tongues are fencing
Too many leaves in the city
Careful like an orchid
Love survives forever
Age of paranoia
Don't be such a modern stranger
Oh angel
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting


Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting18Embed
