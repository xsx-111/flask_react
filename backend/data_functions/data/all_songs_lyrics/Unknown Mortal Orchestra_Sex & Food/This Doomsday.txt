This Doomsday Lyrics
God said it takes far more than confession
Be a good man or give me your best impression
God said my blood's too warm for forgiveness
Set forth on the interstellar ark of sinners

God's face was so big on that day
Lord, don't let me get bored Sunday
Left with a million things to say
Left me on this doomsday

God said the confusion is the feeling
Write a hook here or let it be unappealing
God said read me in the cliff's erosion
Sunlight feels so good but I just can't see nothing

God's face was so big on that day
Lord, don't let me get bored Sunday
Left with a million things to say
Left me on this doomsday
God's face was so big on that day
Lord, don't let me get bored Sunday
Left with a million things to say
Left me on this doomsday2Embed
