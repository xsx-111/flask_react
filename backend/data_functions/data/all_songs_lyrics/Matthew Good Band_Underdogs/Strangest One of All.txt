Strangest One of All LyricsHate deliver me back into the shiny land
Of opportunity where I have the name I am
Melted down no-smile action figure man
Pop community cooler than, cooler than
So bad, I kind of of felt I was the same
So glad you heard
The strangest one of all
The strangest one of
High fidelity lovers in a Lo-Fi land
Care facility where they own the name I am
Melted down, she pulls the strings, I move and wham
Barely new and we're cooler than, cooler than
So bad, I kind of felt I was to blame
So glad you heard
The strangest one of all
The strangest one of all
The strangest one of all
The strangest one of
When will you see these things
In another way, any other way
And in another way
And in another way
And in another way
And in another way
So bad, I kind of felt I was to blame
So glad you heard
So bad, I kind of felt I was the same
So glad you heard
The strangest one of all
The strangest one of all
The strangest one of all
The strangest one of
Cooler than, cooler than
Gonna be cooler than, cooler than
Cooler than, cooler than
The strangest one of allEmbed
