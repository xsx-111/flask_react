Indestructible LyricsI died in a motor crash
I came back for you, the perfect version of myself
Tomorrow we start again
Tomorrow came and went
I'm indestructible, how
And I'm indestructible
And I'm indestructible, how
And I'm into, I'm in two
We won't say a thing
While you give your life away
Give your life away, not a thing
We won't say a thing
While you give your life away
I died in an amusement park accident
I came back for you so you wouldn't be alone
And if I go away again
You can have my stereo
I'm indestructible, how
And I'm indestructible
And I'm indestructible, how
And I'm into, I'm in two
We won't say a thing
While you give your life away
Give your life away, not a thing
We won't say a thing
While you give your
I'm indestructible
And I'm indestructible
And I'm indestructibleEmbed
