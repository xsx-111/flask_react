The Inescapable Us LyricsThe day I met you decay will let you
Learn to bend
We are better butterflies
All meek we get the end
It makes me sick
It makes me laugh when I shouldn't
Kill what I came to keep alive
Your turn to spill
Your turn to spill
Your turn to spill, now
That's fate looking our way
Your sparkling spot hasn't caught on
That's fate stealing away
Your sparkling spot hasn't caught on
Hasn't caught on
The day we met up it's hard to get up
And live it down
We are smaller maybe
Than what we can't get around
It makes me sick
It makes me laugh when I look at you
Clap while it's kicking us around
And what it spills
And what it spills
And what it spills is
Fate, looking our way
Your sparkling spot hasn't caught on
That's fate stealing away
Your sparkling spot hasn't caught on
Hasn't caught on
Hasn't caught on
Hasn't caught onEmbed
