Deep Six Lyrics
Deep Six
Come to bare
Good night and take care
Who knows
Maybe our luck could change
Polyurethane
People live in the rain
Who knows
Maybe our luck could change

And I don't know
Where you think you are
And I don't know, pretend to know, I don't know
Where you think you are

Big crash
Funny car
Is where you've been
Where you are?
Think fast
And kill what you cannot change
Still though
This is fun
Find a box
When I'm done
Who knows
Maybe my luck could change
And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Where you think you are
And I don't know, pretend to know, I don't know
Where you think you are

Deep six
Come to bare
It's midnight everywhere
Who knows, who knows
Polyurethane
People live
In the rain
Who knows
Maybe our luck could change

And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Where you think you are
And I don't know, pretend to know, I don't know
Where you think you areEmbed
