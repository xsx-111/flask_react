My Out of Style is Coming Back LyricsSome days are short
Some days are longer
I sold my skin
I sold the skin that I am in for a plan
My out of style is coming back
I'm bored but I'm excited
Our out of style is coming back
We're bored but we're excited
Some days are more
Some days than others
I'll shed my skin
I'll shed my
My out of style is coming back
I'm bored but I'm excited
Our out of style is coming back
We're bored but we're excited
And I tried but it failed me
Like everything that's cool is old in my skull
And I tried but it failed me
Living only to die dumb
My out of style is coming back
I'm bored but I'm, bored but I'm
Our out of style is coming back
I'm bored and I'm crooked like
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody
And everybody, ohEmbed
