Invasion 1 LyricsWe wore pink in the 80's
What were we thinking?
I got a brain cloud from the black light in your room
Built up B.C. just crazy
But it just made us jumpy
When we should have been smooth
How do they save you from yourself?
How do they save you from yourself?
How will she save me from myself?
I know just what you mean
Who will spearhead the invasion?
I know just how you feel
Who will spearhead
(Unintelligible)
Dropped off the face of the Earth
Bobby is my hero for that
Down a hole with the Grinch's antler dog
And Yukon Cornelius
When I'm sober I need this
I know just what you mean
Who will spearhead the invasion?
I know just how you feel
Who will spearhead
All right
I know just what you mean to me
Who will spearhead the invasion
I know just how you feel
And I feel, and I feelEmbed
