Middle Class Gangsters LyricsAin't got no action grip
Don't come with a full compliment of weapons
Get off your illin' tip
I don't recognize anybody from around here anymore
And I don't want to be, no, no
Your punching bag
Are we losing?
Are we middle class gangsters?
Wasn't looking at your girlfriend
Didn't touch your Mustang when I was
In the parking lot
What don't you comprehend
Well I'll speak slowly if you're on something
Or faster if you're not
And I don't want to be, no, no
Your punching bag
Are we losing?
Are we middle class gangsters?
So put on British steel
Curse today and how you're feeling
Well everybody up and down my block
They used to matter when we used to rock
And I don't want to be
Your punching bag
Are we losing?
Are we middle class gangsters?
