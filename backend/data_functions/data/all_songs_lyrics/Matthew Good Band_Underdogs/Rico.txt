Rico LyricsRico was a short man
Wants to live with a long-haired girl in Cosa Meda
Rip off fruit stands
During the getaway she will drive the Vespa
He's gonna buy a parrot
That speaks her language
But all it'll say is "what are you doing with him?
Let's take off, take off, take off, take off"
And everyone's gotta be something
Me, I'm garbage
It's all I ever wanted to be
Shock me again and I'll say
Anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
I'll say anything you want me to
Anything you want
Let it play out
Buy the rights to Endless Love
If your friends don't like it you can tell them, from me
To fuck off, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off
Everyone's gotta be something
Me, I'm stupid
It's all I ever wanted to be
Shock me again and I'll say
Anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
I'll say anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
I'll say anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
Anything you want me to
Anything you want
Everyone's gotta be something
Me, I'm loaded
It's all I ever wanted to be
Shock me again and I'll stay
I'll stayEmbed
