Gutter Cat vs. The Jets Lyrics
I met an alley cat
Pussyfootin' around
Till the break of dawn
Found me knocked out flat on my head
Some feline beauty
Waved her tail my way
I just had to stay
I couldn't get the blood off my hands

She made my eyes bug out
Her tail stand up
And I ain't even in heat for a month
Meow
House cat
You really got it made
Sleepin all night
And perfect delight of day
Some feline beauty
Waved her tail my way
And I just had to stay
I couldn't get the blood off my bed
She made my eyes bug out
Her tail stand up
And I ain't even in heat for a month
Some bad cats from 4th Street
Come down to our alley
Well, we say that's cool
But just stay away from me and my boys
Eyes clash, and claws slash
And green-eyed fur goes flyin
Midnight, catfight
Neck-bite, die

When you're a Jet
You're a Jet all the way
From your first cigarette
Till your last dyin day
When you're a Jet
Let 'em do what they can
Little boy, you got friends
You're a family man
The Jets are in gear
They're always well-respected
You're never alone
When company's expected
You're well-protected
Here come the Jets
Like a bat out of hell
Someone gets in our way
Someone don't feel so well
When you're a Jet
You stay a JetEmbed
