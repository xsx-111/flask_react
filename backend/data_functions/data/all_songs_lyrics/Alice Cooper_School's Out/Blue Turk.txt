Blue Turk Lyrics
I'm lazy, you know it
I'm ready for the second show
Amazin' thing growin'
Just waitin' for the juice to flow

But you're so very picturesque
You're so very cold
Tastes like roses on your breath but
Graveyards on your soul
I'm hurtin', I'm walkin'
I'm achin' for another go
You're squirmin', wet baby
Nothing bad comin' very slow
And it's burnin' holes in me

You're so very picturesque
You're so very cold
It tastes like roses on your breath but
Graveyards on your soul
Woah-woah-woah

One spastic explosion
Two pressure cookers go insane
It makes me act crazy
I shiver but I love this game

But you're so very ordinary
You're so very lame
Tastes like whiskey on your lips and
Earthworms rule your brain1Embed
