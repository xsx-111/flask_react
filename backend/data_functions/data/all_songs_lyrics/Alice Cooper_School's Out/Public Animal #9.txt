Public Animal #9 Lyrics
(Hey, hey, hey, yeah!)
(Hey, hey, hey!)

Me and G.B
We ain't never gonna confess
We cheated at the math test
We carved some dirty words in our desk
Well, now it's time for recess
Old man waitin by the monkey bars
Tradin all his ball cards
And they promised him a gold star
And they told him he could go far

Hey, Mr. Bluelegs
Where are you takin me?
I'm like a lifer
In the state penitentiary
If I keep my nose clean
I won't get my eyes shined
But I'm proud to be
Public Animal Number Nine
License plates are runnin
Out of my ears
I'd give a month of cigarettes
For just a couple of lousy beers
Or even a bottle of real cheap wine
But that's the price you pay to be
Public Animal Number Nine
Number Nine, oh!
Hey, Mrs. Cranston
Where are you takin me?
I feel like a lifer
In the state penitentiary
She wanted an Einstein
But she got a Frankenstein
Yeah, I'm proud to be
Public Animal Number Nine

Ow! Public animal number nine
Public animal number nine
Public animal number nine, nine
Public animal number nine, number nine
Number nine, number nine
Number, number nine, animal number nine
Public animal number nine, nine
Public animal number nine
Public animal number nine, ergh!
Public animal number nine
Public animal number nine
Public animal number, number nine, nine
Public animal naa!Embed
