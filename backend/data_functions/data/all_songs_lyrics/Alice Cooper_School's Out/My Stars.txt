My Stars Lyrics
My stars, so far
No one's callin me home
Space brain, vagabond
Living on my own

Come all you faithful
You know all you people should come to me
I'll make you arms work
And I'll make your legs work
I'll make you see
Ladada-dadada
Dadada-dadada
Da-da-dum, whoa-yeah
Well I swear by the air
I'll be made to breathe
You'll pay very dear for this banishing deed
The power alone stored in my little hand
Could melt the Eiffel Tower
Turn the Sphinx into sand
Oh, oh, oh

Oh no, thar she blows
Spreadin crazy news
All night, cannonball
Loves to light the fuse
And everyone blows up
And nobody grows up to fill dad's shoes
But that doesn't matter
Cause no little boys really wanted to
Ladada-dadada
Dadada-dadada
Da-da-dum, woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah
I stared at the squall line
I stared at the fault line
I see a funnel black there
I think I see a crack there
Landscapes alive
And it's movin' my feet
All I need's a Holocaust
To make my day complete, oh
