Alma Mater Lyrics
Rain is falling down my cheek
Searching for the sea
Tomorrow, like the rain
I'll be back home again

I watch, the bus
As it pulls out of view
Someday like that bus
I will be leaving too
But you know
It breaks my heart
To leave you, Camelback
My high school

And now, alone
Crying in my beer
Cause old friends said goodbye
I guess I'll be leaving too
But you know
It breaks my heart
To leave you, Cortez
I'll miss you
Yes I will, yes I will
You know I will
Yes I will, yes I will
You know I will

Well, so long (so long)
Everybody (everybody)
I hope that I would see you again (again)
Goodbye (goodbye)
Everybody (everybody)
I finally grew up
They finally let me out of school
Hey, remember the time, 'member the time
We took that snake and we
We put it down little Betsy's dress?
Now, I don't think Miss Axelrod
Was much impressed
Now, I don't think Miss Axelrod
Was much impressed
Well, I don't think Miss Axelrod
Was much impressed
Oh, goodbye (goodbye)
Everybody (everybody)
I hope that I would see you again (again)
So long (so long)
Everybody (everybody)
How do you like that?
They finally let me out of school
Goodbye (goodbye)
Ah, I wanna get out of here
They let me out of school
How 'bout that, uh?
(They let me out of school) Goodbye
Hey, goodbye guys, maybe I'll see
Maybe I'll see you around some time, uh?
Ey, don't make a stranger of yourself, uh?
Remember the Coop, uh?
I ho, I hope
You don't forget me or nothing
GoodbyeEmbed
