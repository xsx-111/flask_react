Autumn Sweater Lyrics
When I heard the knock on the door
I couldn't catch my breath
Is it too late to call this off?

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

I tried my best to hide
In a crowded room, it's nearly possible
I wait for you, oh, most patiently

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

So I looked for your eyes
And the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them
I'll try hard, I'll try always, but it's a waste of time
It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily
Like in the beginning
In the beginning
We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

You in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater4Embed
