Tiger Mountain Peasant Song Lyrics
Wanderers this morning came by
Where did they go, graceful in the morning light?
To banner fair, to follow you softly
In the cold mountain air

Through the forest, down to your grave
Where the birds wait, and the tall grasses wave
They do not know you anymore, more, more, more

Dear shadow alive and well
How can the body die?
You tell me everything
Anything true

Into town one morning I went
Staggering through premonitions of my death
I don't see anybody that dear to me

Dear shadow alive and well
How can the body die?
You tell me everything
Anything true
Jesse
I don't know what I have done
I'm turning myself to a demon
I don't know what I have done
I'm turning myself to a demon4Embed
