Meadowlarks Lyrics
Meadowlark, fly your way down
I hold a cornucopia and a golden crown
For you to wear upon your fleecy down

My meadowlark, sing to me

Hummingbird, just let me die
Inside the broken ovals of your olive eye
I do believe you gave it your best try

My hummingbird, sing to me


My hummingbird, sing to me

Don't believe a word that I haven't heard
Little children laughing at the boys and girls
The meadowlark singing to you each and every day
The arc light on the hillside and the market in the hay2Embed
