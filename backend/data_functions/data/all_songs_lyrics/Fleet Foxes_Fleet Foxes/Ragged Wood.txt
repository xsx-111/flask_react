Ragged Wood Lyrics
Come down from the mountain, you have been gone too long
The spring is upon us, follow my ornate song
Settle down with me by the fire of my yearning
You should come back home, back on your own now

The world is alive now, in and outside our home
You run through the forest, settle before the sun
Darling, I can barely remember you beside me
You should come back home, back on your own now
You should come back home, back on your own now

In the evening light, when the woman of the woods came by
To give to you the word of the old man
In the morning tide when the sparrow and the seagull fly
And Johnathan and Evelyn get tired


Lie to me if you will at the top of Barringer Hill
Tell me anything you want, any old lie will do
Call me back to, back to you
Lie to me if you will at the top of Barringer Hill
Tell me anything you want, any old lie will do
Call me back to, back to you
Back to you, back to you, back to you, back to you10Embed
