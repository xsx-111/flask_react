Oliver James Lyrics
On the way to your brother's house in the valley, dear
By the river bridge, a cradle floating beside me
In the whitest water on the bank, against the stone
You will lift his body from the shore and bring him home

Oliver James, washed in the rain
No longer
Oliver James, washed in the rain
No longer

On the kitchen table that your grandfather did make
You and your delicate way will slowly clean his face
And you will remember when you rehearsed the actions of
An innocent and anxious mother full of anxious love

Oliver James, washed in the rain
No longer
Oliver James, washed in the rain
No longer

Walk with me down Ruby Beach and through the valley floor
Love for the one you know more
Love for the one you know more
Back we go to your brother's house emptier, my dear
The sound of ancient voices ringing soft upon your ear

Oliver James, washed in the rain
No longer
Oliver James, washed in the rain
No longerEmbed
