Quiet Houses Lyrics
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down
Darkening, darkening
Darkening, darkening
Darkening, darkening
Darkening, darkening

Come to me, come to me
Come to me, come to me
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down

Quiet houses, lit up by candlelight
In the gloom of the dawn
Quiet houses, lit up by candlelight
Light of an English songEmbed
