Blue Ridge Mountains Lyrics
Lie down with me my dear, lie down
Under stormy night, tell nobody

My brother, where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee

You're ever welcome with me any time you like
Let's drive to the countryside, leave behind some green-eyed look-a-likes
So no one gets worried, no
So no one gets worried, no

But Sean, don't get careless
I'm sure it'll be fine
I love you, I love you
Oh, brother of mine

In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest
And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light
Terrible am I, child?
Even if you don't mind

In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest
And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

Terrible am I, child?
Even if you don't mind, no15Embed
