Your Protector Lyrics
She left a week to roam
Your protector's coming home
Keep your secrets with you, girl
Safe from the outside world
You walk along the stream
Your head caught in a waking dream
Your protector's coming home, coming home

As you lay to die beside me, baby
On the morning that you came
Would you wait for me?
The other one would wait for me
As you lay to die beside me, baby
On the morning that you came
Would you wait for me?
The other one would wait for me

You run with the devil
You run with the devil

Tell your brother to be good
Tell your sister not to go
Tell your mother not to wait
Tell your father I was good
As you lay to die beside me, baby
On the morning that you came
Would you wait for me?
The other one would wait for me3Embed
