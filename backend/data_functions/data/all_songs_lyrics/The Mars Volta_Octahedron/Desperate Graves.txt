Desperate Graves Lyrics
The swarms that I speak are the wrists I have cut
By flooding the tubs where the warmth held her up
The lockets believe that the secret of love
Has caught its own tail and it just won't give up

When I breathe, the heavens can't hold me
And I can't believe anymore
The light brings the highest execution
Show me the wings I must cut

In your landfill days, these are desperate graves
Give me the altar, red will shine
This pendulum won't wait
In your landfill days, these are desperate graves
Give me the altar, red will shine
This pendulum won't wait

If I slay your spirit with twin current volts
That weak in your knees in the pit of my palms
Dressed in the slurs of bovine engines
To feast upon the carcass of your mother
When I breathe, the heavens can't hold me
And I can't believe anymore
The light brings the highest execution
Show me the wings I must cut

In your landfill days, these are desperate graves
Give me the altar, red will shine
This pendulum won't wait
In your landfill days, these are desperate graves
Give me the altar, red will shine
This pendulum won't wait

When I turn the dial and leave the gas on
I'm the matchstick that you'll never lose
These are the splinters made from a single blade
I'm the matchstick that you'll never lose
I light the key that locks you in
I'm the matchstick that you'll never lose
And you'll wear the burden of all my burns
I'm the matchstick that you'll never lose

In your landfill days, these are desperate graves
Give me the altar, red will shine
This pendulum won't wait
In your landfill days, these are desperate graves
Give me the altar, red will shine
This pendulum won't wait
In your landfill days, these are desperate graves
Give me the altar, red will shine
This pendulum won't wait
In your landfill days, these are desperate graves
Give me the altar, red will shine
This pendulum won't wait1Embed
