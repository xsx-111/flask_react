Copernicus Lyrics
Close the doors
If you want to see her breathing again
Blur the days
Sleeping is just not an option

How come every time I walk you crawl?
When you cut out all the letters that make up this note
I won't, I won't give up 'til I find out
'Til I find what happened to you

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
Holds a maximum vacancy
As I held you in crippled bandages
Don't you stay up and wait for me

Left dangling in the wind

You're not there
I poke needles in the neck of a doll
She pokes back
Asking why can't I just let her out
How come every time I walk you crawl?
When you cut out all the letters that make up this note
And why I won't give up 'til I find out what happened to you

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
Holds a maximum vacancy
As I hold you in crippled bandages
Don't you stay up and wait for me

Left dangling in the wind

Don't let the days escape
What I did brings more of them
And we'll be waiting just for them
Over my dead body
Over the search they lead
And they won't find them anymore
Don't let the days escape
What I did brings more of them
And we'll be waiting just for them
Over my dead body
Over the search they lead
And they won't find them anymore
Now that I collect
From cells that we once shared
With multi-headed union
Of multiple selves

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
Holds a maximum vacancy
As I held you in crippled bandages
Don't you stay up and wait for me

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
Holds a maximum vacancy
As I hold you in crippled bandages
Don't you stay up and wait for me

Left dangling in the wind1Embed
