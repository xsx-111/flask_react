Teflon Lyrics
I just don't know the layman's terms
To call the mess you breed
What thaws beneath this surface
Soils blood to your family tree

The dates, they change with each new phase
I'm anxious bouts of nervous

What am I without the bruises?
This switch, it won't come on
What do I do to lose it
Beneath this distress call? Oh

Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with the body inside
Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with the body inside

Frames of infrared
Keep scrolling into focus
Scarab crank the busy signal
With the habits that you noticed
The dates, they change with each new phase
I'm anxious bouts of nervous

What am I without the bruises?
This switch, it won't come on
What do I do to lose it
Beneath this distress call? Oh

Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with the body inside
Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with the body inside

Taking all the hostages into the Oval Office
Draw the curtains, part their hair and pull the trigger softly
If they have me committed, then I'll just take you with me
One driver in your motorcade is all it takes, is all it takes
Sandmen grains in Teflon veins is all it takes, is all it takes

What am I without the bruises?
This switch, it won't come on
What do I do to lose it
Beneath this distress call? Oh!
Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with the body inside
Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with the body inside1Embed
