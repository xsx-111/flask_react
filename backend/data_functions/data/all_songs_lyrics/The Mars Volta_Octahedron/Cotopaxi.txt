Cotopaxi Lyrics
When Sanskrit was my mother tongue
Scarabs filled my pillow
Tarmac strips to pave for them
Thrones from which to teach
And in that pulse the future said
Story had been spun
You wet your bed so sleep in it
Cards can't make a house

Up that hill go the last of my crumbs
We'll be lucky if we eat tonight
And up that hill go the last of my crumbs
That's why I'll magnify a hole

When light years came and light years passed
Tugging on the brink
Spoils reported missing
Put down in its sleep
Strangled in the background
Fitted for a mask
The future won't believe you
Past the ransom fast
Up that hill go the last of my crumbs
We'll be lucky if we eat tonight
And up that hill go the last of my crumbs
That's why I'll magnify a hole

Don't beat around the pulpit
There is no lost and found
Where is the devil waiting, trying to disguise?
I've seen what you used to look like
Down here you won't survive

I've got the weight of half of the world
Don't stop dragging the lake, don't stop dragging the lake
I won't come home if you can't come home
Even if you make a grave with my name
I've got the weight of half of the world
You better keep on looking for me
I won't come home if you can't come home
Don't stop dragging the lake, don't stop dragging the lake

Up that hill go the last of my crumbs
We'll be lucky if we eat tonight
Up that hill go the last of my crumbs
That's when I'll magnify a hole (In your abdomen)
Find me the head
And I'll show you the body
Lay it to rest
Don't say you're sorry4Embed
