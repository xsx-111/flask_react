With Twilight As My Guide Lyrics
I'm bolted from within
From long conniving heights
The hail, it makes a special sound
That always stays into the night

She tells me I'm not capable of what they accuse me
With no remorse I stand and say that guilty is what I plead

My devil makes me dream
Like no other mortal dreams
With a blank eye corner
The only way to see him in the tunnel where he slept
By the longest tusk of corridors, numb below the neck
In my heart, where he keeps them in a vault of devil daughters

When I bend in kicking form
With twilight as my guide
In every home the ghost veins gossip
You can hear them if you try

When my quill begins to squirm from the ashes in your urn
Your deviance is anything but faithful
My devil makes me dream
Like no other mortal dreams
With a blank eye corner
The only way to see him in the tunnel where he slept
By the longest tusk of corridors, numb below the neck
In my heart, where he keeps them in a vault of devil daughters

Every body hangs like dead leaves
Don't you hurt these branches waiting
I've been watching you fall to me
Don't desert me, I'm not waiting

My devil makes me dream
Like no other mortal dreams
With a blank eye corner
The only way to see him in the tunnel where he slept
By the longest tusk of corridors, numb below the neck
In my heart, where he keeps them in a vault of devil daughters1Embed
