House Where Nobody Lives LyricsThere's a house on my block that's abandoned and cold
The folks moved out of it a long time ago
And they took all their things and they never came back
It looks like it's haunted with the windows all cracked
Everyone calls it the house, the house where nobody lives
Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams
Did they throw it away?
Did they know what it means?
Did someone's heart break?
Or did someone do somebody wrong?
Well the paint was all cracked, it was peeled off of the wood
The papers were stacked on the porch where I stood
And the weeds had grown up just as high as the door
There were birds in the chimney and an old chest of drawers
Looks like no one will ever come back to the house where nobody lives
Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams
Did they throw it away?
Did they know what it means?
Did someone's heart break?
Or did someone do somebody wrong?
So if you find someone, someone to have, someone to hold
Don't trade it for silver, oh don't trade it for gold
'Cause I have all of life's treasures and they're fine and they're good
They remind me that houses are just made of wood
What makes a house grand ain't the roof or the doors
If there's love in a house, it's a palace for sure
Without love, it ain't nothin' but a house
A house where nobody lives
Without love it ain't nothin' but a house
A house where nobody lives1Embed
