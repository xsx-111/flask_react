Georgia Lee Lyrics
Cold was the night and hard was the ground
They found her in a small grove of trees
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
She's too young to be out on the street

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?

Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia from dropping out of school
I was doing the best that I could
But she kept runnin' away from this world
These children are so hard to raise good

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?

Close your eyes and count to ten
I will go and hide but then be sure to find me
I want you to find me and we'll play all over
We will play all over again
There's a toad in the witch grass, there's a crow in the corn
Wild flowers on a cross by the road
And somewhere a baby is crying for her mom
As the hills turn from green back to gold
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?Embed
