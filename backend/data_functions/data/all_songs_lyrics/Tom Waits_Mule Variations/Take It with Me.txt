Take It with Me LyricsPhone's off the hook, no one knows where we are
It's a long time since I drank champagne
The ocean is blue as blue as your eyes
I'm gonna take it with me when I go
Old long since gone, now way back when
We lived in Coney Island
There ain't no good thing ever dies
I'm gonna take it with me when I go
Far far away a train whistle blows
Wherever you're goin', wherever you've been
Waving goodbye at the end of the day
You're up and you're over and you're far away
Always for you and forever yours
It felt just like the old days
We fell asleep on Beulah's porch
I'm gonna take it with me when I go
All broken-down by the side of the road
I was never more alive or alone
I've worn the faces off all the cards
I'm gonna take it with me when I go
Children are playing at the end of the day
Strangers are singing on our lawn
It's got to be more than flesh and bone
All that you've loved is all you own
In a land, there's a town
And in that town, there's a house
And in that house, there's a woman
And in that woman, there's a heart I love
I'm gonna take it with me when I go
I'm gonna take it with me when I goEmbed
