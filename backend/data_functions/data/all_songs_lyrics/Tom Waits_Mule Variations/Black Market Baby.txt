Black Market Baby LyricsShe lives in a house that's way back off the road
There's a man with a lantern and he carries her soul
A coal stove and a bed, a skillet and a hound
She drove a camel through a needle in this sinking boardwalk town
She's my black market baby
She's my black market baby
She's a diamond that wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal
I swang out wide with her on hell's iron gate
Anything that you wanted, you could have
My eyes say their prayers to her, sailors ring her bell
The way a moth mistakes a light bulb for the moon and goes to hell
She's my black market baby
She's my black market baby
She's a diamond that wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal
There's no prayer like desire, there's amnesia in her kiss
She's a swan and a pistol and she will follow you like this
In Moberly, Missouri at the Iroquois Hotel
She checked in with the President and she ran up quite a bill
She's my black market baby
She's my black market baby
She's a diamond that wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal
She's whiskey in a teacup, she gives blondes a lousy name
She's a bonsai Aphrodite and a ticket back to Spain
She's a hard way to go, there ain't no way to stop
Every time you play the red, the black is coming up
She's my black market baby
She's my black market baby
She's a diamond that wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coalEmbed
