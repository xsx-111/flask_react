Pony LyricsI've seen it all, boys, I've been all over
Been everywhere in the whole wide world
I rode the high line with old blind Darby
I danced real slow with Ida Jane
I was full of wonder when I left Murfreesboro
Now I am full of hollow on Maxwell Street
And I hope my pony
I hope my pony
I hope my pony
Knows the way back home
I walked from Natchez to Hushpukena
I built a fire by the side of the road
I worked for nothin in a Belzoni saw mill
I caught a blind out on the B&O
Talullah's friendly, Belzoni ain't so
A 44 will get you 99
I hope my pony
I hope my pony
I hope my pony
Knows the way back home
I run my race with burnt-face Jake
I gave him a Manzanita cross
I lived on nothin' but dreams and train smoke
Somehow my watch and chain got lost
I wish I was home in Evelyn's kitchen
With old Gyp curled around my feet
I hope my pony
I hope my pony
I hope my pony
Knows the way back homeEmbed
