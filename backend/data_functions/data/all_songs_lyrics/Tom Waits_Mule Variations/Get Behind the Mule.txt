Get Behind the Mule LyricsMolly b'Damn smote Jimmy the Harp
With a horrid little pistol and a lariat
She's goin' to the bottom
And she's goin' down the drain
Said she wasn't big enough to carry it
She got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
She got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Choppity-chop goes the axe in the woods
You gotta meet me by the fall down tree
Shovel full of dirt upon a coffin lid
And I know they'll come lookin' for me boys
And I know they'll come a-lookin' for me
Got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Big Jack Earle was 8'1'
He stood in the road and he cried
He couldn't make her love him
And couldn't make her stay
But tell the good Lord that he tried
Got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
You got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Dusty trail from Atchison to Placerville
On the wreck of the Weaverville stage
Beulah fired on Beatty for a lemonade
I was stirring my brandy with a nail, boys
Stirring my brandy with a nail
Got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
You got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Well the rampaging sons of the widow James
Jack the Cutter and the pock-marked kid
Had to stand naked at the bottom of the cross
And tell the good Lord what they did
Tell the good Lord what they did
You got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
You got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Punctuated birds on the power line
In a Studebaker with Birdie Joe Hoaks
I'm diggin' all the way to China with a silver spoon
While the hangman fumbles with the noose, boys
The hangman fumbles with the noose
You got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
You got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Pin your ear to the wisdom post
Pin your eye to the line
Never let the weeds get higher than the garden
Always keep a sapphire in your mind
Always keep a diamond in your mind
You got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the mule in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the mule in the morning and plowEmbed
