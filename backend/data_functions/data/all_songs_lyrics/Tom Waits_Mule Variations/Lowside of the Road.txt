Lowside of the Road LyricsI'm on a black elevator goin' down
Little Joe from Kokomo, it rattles to the ground
The dice is laughin' at the man that he throwed
I'm rollin over to the lowside of the road
The moon is red and you're dancin' real slow
Twenty-nine miles left to go
The chain monkeys help you with your load
You're rollin over to the lowside of the road
Jezebel is naked with an axe
The prosecution tells you to relax
Your head feels like it's ready to explode
You're rollin' over, you're rollin' over
Well, the clapper has been ripped out of the bell
The flapper has been kicked right out of hell
When the horse whips the man that he rode
You're rollin' over to the lowside of the road
The dog won't bite, if you beat him with a bone
She's so shy when she's talkin' on the phone
The ground rises up and starts to groan
You're rollin' over to the lowside of the road
To the lowside of the road
To the lowside of the roadEmbed
