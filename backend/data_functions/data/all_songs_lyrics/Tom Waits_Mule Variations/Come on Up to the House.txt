Come on Up to the House Lyrics
Well, the moon is broken and the sky is cracked
Come on up to the house
The only things that you can see is all that you lack
Come on up to the house
All your cryin' don't do no good
Come on up to the house
Come down off the cross, we can use the wood
You gotta come on up to the house

Come on up to the house
Come on up to the house
The world is not my home
I'm just a-passin' through
You gotta come on up to the house

There's no light in the tunnel, no irons in the fire
Come on up to the house
And you're singing lead soprano in a junkman's choir
You gotta come on up to the house
Does life seem nasty, brutish, and short?
Come on up to the house
The seas are stormy and you can't find no port
Got to come on up to the house
You gotta come on up to the house
Come on up to the house
The world is not my home
I'm just a-passin' through
You gotta come on up to the house

You gotta come on up to the house
Come on up to the house
The world is not my home
I'm just a-passin' through
You gotta come on up to the house

There's nothin in the world that you can do
You gotta come on up to the house
And you been whipped by the forces that are inside you
Gotta come on up to the house
Well, you're high on top of your mountain of woe
Gotta come on up to the house
Well, you know you should surrender, but you can't let go
You gotta come on up to the house

Gotta come on up to the house
Gotta come on up to the house
The world is not my home
I'm just a-passin' through
You gotta come on up to the house4Embed
