10:15 Saturday Night Lyrics
10:15 on a Saturday night
And the tap drips under the strip light
And I'm sitting in the kitchen sink
And the tap drips

Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip...

Waiting for the telephone to ring
And I'm wondering where she's been
And I'm crying for yesterday
And the tap drips

Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip...
