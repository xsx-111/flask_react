Grinding Halt Lyrics
One, two, three, four!

No light, no people
No speak, no people
No cars, no people
No food, no people

Stopped short, grinding halt
Everything's coming to a grinding halt

No sound, no people
No clocks, no people
No fine, no people
No me, no people

Stopped short, grinding halt
Everything's coming to a grinding halt
Everything's coming to a grinding halt

Slow down
Slow down
No people
Slow down
Everything's coming to a
Everything's coming to a
Everything's coming to a
Everything's coming to a2Embed
