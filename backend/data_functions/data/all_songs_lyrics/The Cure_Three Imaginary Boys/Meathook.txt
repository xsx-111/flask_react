Meathook Lyrics
I went into the butcher
I said I wanted, wanted, wanted some meat
Pass me some of that steak over there
You know it...

I lost my heart to a meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook

The butcher man was some lady, who really stole my...
Pass me some of that stuff, that slaughterhouse art

I lost my heart to a meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook
Specimen in my heart
It's tearing me all apart
It's ripping out my insides but I just can't get away
I just can't

Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook, meat
I lost my heart to a meathook
Meathook, meathook, meathook, meathook
Meathook, meathook
Small talk, fun 
My, my, my, my, my, my, oh... meat1Embed
