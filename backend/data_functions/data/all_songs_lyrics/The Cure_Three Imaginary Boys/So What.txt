So What Lyrics
Yeah, cake icing and a... decorating set
Special offer, only 3 pound 30
Save 1 pound 52 on recommended retail price
Give your cakes and pies a professional look
With this superb decorating set
I'm not meant to be here, but so what?
And nobody's, nobody's taken your place
Nobody's taken your place

Each set includes a turntable, a nine inch icing bag
With six high definition nozzles and adapter
And a fifteen-inch food decorating bag
With three piping nozzles
Please send off this leaflet, post it today
And if you knew nothing could replace you
If you were sane, your heart wouldn't ache
But so what?
So what? So what?

Order now, allow twenty one days for delivery
Offer closes 31st of December, 1979
Oh, British Sugar Bureau
When I told you what I, and I
And I wouldn't ask you to pretend that we were one
And still another time
Forget all the lies, forgive me the wounds
And all the world was used to love
And yes, we'd still be happy in another time
But so what?
So what?
So please send me icing and decorating sets
I enclose a cheque and postal order number
So what?
So what?4Embed
