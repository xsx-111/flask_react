Foxy Lady Lyrics(Jimi Hendrix)
When you're ready?
So do we... is it two verses?
No, Lol, no
This is a good intro!

You know you are a cute little heartbreaker
You know your eyes swim, little lovemaker

I want to take you home
I won't do you no harm
You've got to be all mine, all mine

I see you come down on the scene, foxy
You make me want to get up and scream, foxy

I've made up my mind
I'm tired of wasting, tired of wasting all my precious time
You've got to be all mine, all mine

I've made up my mind
I'm tired of wasting all my precious time
You've got to be all mine, all mine1Embed
