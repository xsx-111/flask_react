Surrender To Me Lyrics
I know it never came easy
Girl, you drive me out of my mind
Your fine and still kind of sleazy
Now I want to make you mine
Somehow, I don't believe you
I really need you now
You know you're so good at teasing
Maybe that's what I like
Sometimes you're hot when you're freezing
Don't want to let you out of my sight
Somehow, I don't believe you
I really need you
I don't believe you
And I really need you
(Hey) You never believe what I say
You're gonna surrender someday
Surrender to me

Surrender to me
Surrender to me all the way
Surrender to me all the way (yeah, yeah)
Surrender to me

You've got an attitude
A hardheaded woman that I can't refuse
Your love is kind of rude
You love me like you got nothing to lose
Somehow, I don't believe you
I really need you
I don't believe you
And I really need you
(Hey) You never believe what I say
You're gonna surrender someday
Surrender to me
Surrender to me
Surrender to me all the way
Surrender to me all the way (yeah, yeah)
Surrender to me
All the way
All the way
All the way

All the way
Surrender to me all the way
Surrender to me
