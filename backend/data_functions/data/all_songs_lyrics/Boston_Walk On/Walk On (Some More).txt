Walk On (Some More) Lyrics
Take a look around tell me what you can see
I guess that all depends on exactly what you want it to be
Don't know all the answers everybody's running away, hey
If you want to win the game then you know it's a shame not to play

Everybody get carried away
And everybody's got something to say
To remind you
Keep looking behind you
It's never easy to see
What it takes to believe right from wrong

Never going back where I've gone
Walk On
Hey alright, we're not gonna turn back now
Walk On
Walk On
Just Walk OnEmbed
