Magdalene Lyrics
I, I know I'm a dreamer
It's easy to see I want to be a believer
And fly right through the air
Now I'm wide awake
I want you to take me there

The things that you told me
I don't know if I was dreaming
And dreams aren't enough
Life is so lonely
I need someone to believe in
Are you in love?
Can't you see that's everything to me
That's enough

Magdalene, let me hear it said so I am sure
Answer me - can't you see that's all I'm waiting for?
Here I am on my knees once more
Magdalene

Time must lead you somewhere
I don't want to wait
I know you can take me there
The way that you hold me
I don't know if I was dreaming
And dreams aren't enough
Life is so lonely
I need someone to believe in
Someone to love
Can't you see that's everything to me
That's enough

Magdalene let me hear it said so I am sure
Answer me - can't you see that's all I'm waiting for?
Here I am on my knees
Oh, I'm begging you please
Magdalene
