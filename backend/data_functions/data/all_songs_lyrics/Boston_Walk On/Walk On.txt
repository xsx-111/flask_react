Walk On Lyrics
Take a look around and tell me what you see
I guess that all depend on exaclty what you want it to be
Is your cup half-full? Is your cup half-empty?
How can you get what you need in the land of plenty?

Everybody gets carried away
Everybody's trying everyday to remind you
(Ooo) Leave it behind you
What's it take to see?
What's it take to believe right from wrong?
Never knowing where you belong
Walk On
Walk On

Sometimes I feel like I'm just doing time
Everybody wonders where you're going when you step out of line
Don't know all the answers, someone's got to stand up and say "Hey!"
If you want to win the game then you know you're gonna have to play

Everybody's got to find a way
And everybody's trying everyday to remind you
What's standing behind you?
What's it take to see?
What's it take to believe right from wrong?
Never knowing where you belong
Walk On
Walk On
Walk On
There's no turning back
Walk On
Get your train on the trackEmbed
