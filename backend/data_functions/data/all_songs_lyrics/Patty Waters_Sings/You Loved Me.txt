You Loved Me LyricsYour love has never been for me
I'm certain of it now
But there is so much of my heart
Lost to you somehow
I lived each day with you in mind
And though you didn't know
You loved me
I wonder
Could you
Ever love
You may not spare the time
But you're
The one
Who told me
About how patience is no crime
I didn't need to be near you
To feel your strength, dear sir
I change my mind too late, that's all
You're still the man you were
You'll never know how much you gave
And what it meant to me
You loved meEmbed
