Chicago People LyricsStill want just lately, this won't do
Too long, still all lost until just lately
A hollow moon to keep on starting
The weather's fine, it's just what they say
Don't I count on an old friend to get the judge out on me?
A  of too much patience, open arms invitation
Get along to gather the notion, I'd rather up on me
And still I brought enough this trial to anywhere
To all my brotherly up above it
I should try not to let it loose this time
You're gonna know it
Bleeding bleeding bleeding bleedingEmbed
