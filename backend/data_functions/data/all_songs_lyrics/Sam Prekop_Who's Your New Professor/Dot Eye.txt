Dot Eye LyricsDo I believe I’ve been wrong?
I couldn’t say for sure (don’t I)
Obsession craves all my time
It’s no wonder, love (can I)
Twilight things to remember now
The presence is real
The less I know, the better now
Gotta mind that door
And so I’ve been down two long ways
Gotta know for sure (don’t I)
We don’t believe in this grace
All this talking, no wonder why
Settle down on the reveries
The wrong time to go
Diluted now
It’s growing impatient
Follow now your ability
It’s all we see
It’s “all I need is a remedy” to you
Still I get standing still too long
I know it’s doubtful
Still here, but I’m bound to now
I get along to nowhereEmbed
