Two Dedications LyricsIt's too late for me and what do I suppose I, I started to rely?
I'm feeling all my precious revenge, yeah
I'm staring nowhere and settle on to it
It's too late for me and still I keep talking within, yeah
I do what you want to
Some of them to always
I say what you want to
Two eyes got in my way
Reflections eye to eye, so one of them mistreated
The chance I know I'm gone and meditate the far-out I'm in, yeah
Surrender to reply, I give a lot to gеt there, don't lie
Do what you want to
Somе of them keep it always, still on time
I say what you want to, do nothing 
Two eyes got in my way
What am I gonna do?
Dedications all about and then it's all to pieces
I'm still alive, rather I'd rather know
I'm going to toast just them
Look a little further behind a stare
Already feel no pain and finally so fleeting
We are there to hold 
Do what you want to
Some of them keep it always, still on time
I say what you want to, do nothing 
Two eyes got in my way
What am I gonna do?
Dedications all about and then it's all to pieces
I'm still alive, rather I'd rather know
I'm going to toast just them
Look a little further behind a stareEmbed
