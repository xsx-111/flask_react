Something LyricsStill I wonder what I've been
Understanding all the ways
That you're bound to let me know
I thought I'd keep it close to mind
I'd rather say we're just starting
Carefully on our way
And there's no reason
I know there's something
Cross our minds together
With standing mystery
You fell in my hands without notice
I had to try and think
Do you want?
Will you stay?
As soon as only I am able
I'm taking my time all evening, yeah
Still on, still on too
Still on too
Still on, still on too
Still on
What do you wonder?
Does it make sense?
Walls collide every day
Up on lies, malady
Still on my mind
I don't know just lately
You made it
But I'll wait and see
As soon as only I am able
I'm thinking that it's what I found
Something's got to give
I won't let go, so you knowEmbed
