Look What I Stole for Us, Darling (Introduction) Lyrics("Thóg héileacaptar an Aerchór cailín cúig bliana déag d’aois as Oileán Inis Arcáin...")
Aodhagan went hunting for food and money
Through the streets of Walthamstow
But the dim Sunday passed with nary a catch
And the dogs came home alone
Eat me now...
("We inspect our genitalia on a regular basis.")Embed
