Chemical Cosh LyricsAlcohol, heroin, THC
Care in the impotent (numb) community
Resignation, irony, under scrutiny, so events can slip
From memory of history, a voluntary dictatorship
Chemical (cosh!)
One kind for the rich, and one for the poor
The only distinction is the thickness of their front door
Unless it makes you act up, the law won't mind
You play this game, the land is yours, the warden is blind
Chemical (cosh!)
Chemical (cosh!)
It's the only kind we got (cosh!)
If you won't come across
They will have it known you're mad if you don't fit (with) their equation
They will have you for not being rich or body-tax evasion
And they'll pay some stoned stockbroker's son
To phone and say, "I'm coming 'round and bringing my machine gun!"
Chemical (cosh!)
Chemical (cosh!)
It's a stab in the neck and a boot in the chops
From the earth-loving decade which denim forgotEmbed
