Out of Control LyricsBreaks away the chains that bind me
Gives me sympathy
Keeps me running on the high road
Keeps me living free
Never tries to steal my thunder
Helps me through the night
Always there to help and guide me
Makes me feel alright
There ain't no doubt about it
Just can't live without her
Moves my very soul
When we touch I lose control
I'm outta control
I lose control
I'm outta control
When I feel depressed and lonely
She never asks me why
Always knows just when to leave me
When I start to lie
Tries to think about the next day
So I can survive
When I come home tired and weary
She keeps me satisfied
There ain't no doubt about it
Just can't live without her
Moves my very soul
When we touch I lose control
She breaks away the chains that bind me
Gives me sympathy
Keeps me running on the high road
Keeps me living free
Never tries to steal my thunder
Helps me through the night
Always there to help and guide me
Makes me feel alright
There ain't no doubt about it
Just can't live without her
Moves my very soul
When we touch I lose control
I'm outta control
I lose control
I'm outta control
