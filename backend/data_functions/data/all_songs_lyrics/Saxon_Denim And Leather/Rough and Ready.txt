Rough and Ready LyricsWell, you're brought up on the street
Did ya make it on your own
Are ya living in the shadow
Crawling in the night
Sleeping in the subway
Beggin' for a fight
Makes ya grow up hard, boy
Aren't you ready for a fight
I don't need no one
You can keep you sympathy
I live on my own
I would make that company
I don't need no one
You can keep you sympathy
I live on my own
I would make that company
I'm rough and ready tonight
Crawling in the night
Standing on the corner
Asked ya for smoke
I kick you in the deep, boy
Steel away you girl
Talked into a night fight
They cut me to the bone
Don't ya mess with me, boy
Ya better leave me alone
I don't need no one
You can keep you sympathy
I live on my own
I would make that company
I don't need no one
You can keep you sympathy
I live on my own
I would make that company
I'm rough and ready tonight
Maybe seeing a call girl
I'll take ya for a ride
The cops will never break me
Steal away my pride
If you're looking for a good time
And ya wanna ride with me
And you're feeling rough and ready
Rough and ready with me
You can change my life
You can read my mind
I don't want no one
I don't have no one
I don't need no one
You can keep your sympathy
Well, you're brought up on the street
Did ya make it on your own
Sleeping in the subway
Begging for a fight
Makes ya grow up hard, boy
Ain't you ready for a fight
I don't need no one
You can keep you sympathy
I live on my own
I don't need no one
You can keep you sympathy
I live on my own
I would make that company
I'm rough and ready tonight
Rough and ready tonight
