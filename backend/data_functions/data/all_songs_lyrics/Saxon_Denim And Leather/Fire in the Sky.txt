Fire in the Sky LyricsThere's a fire in the sky
There's a feeling in the air
When the ground starts to tremble
The first attack is here
You won't stand a chance
When the missiles start to fly
They never tell the people
Till the holocaust is here
When the fire's in the sky
You'll be running for your lives
When the fire's in the sky
Prepare yourselves to die
Where, where are the shelters
They said they would be there
You'll need, need some protection
From the radiation flare
Don't, don't start a panic
It won't do you no good
You'll just have to wait
For the end of all mankind
If you're near the point of impact
There's nowhere you can run
If the heatwave don't get you
The shockwave surely will
There won't be no more heroes
There's no one left to fight
It's the end of our planet
We'd commit eternal sight
When the fire's in the sky
You'll be running for your lives
When the fire's in the sky
Prepare yourselves to die
When the fire's in the sky
You'll be running for your lives
When the fire's in the sky
Prepare yourselves to die
To die, to die, to die ...Embed
