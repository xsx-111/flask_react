Midnight Rider LyricsRide the silver eagle out of JFK
Up the eastern seaboard destination Portland Maine
When we saw the people at the concert hall
The seats were for five thousand it made us feel so small
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
Right on through the USA
Stopped off at Niagara taking pictures of the falls
Tried to cross the border were accosted by the law
People down in Texas from the red hot burning sun
They couldn't stand the heatwave but we just kept rollin' on
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
Right on through the USA
Driving into Nashville on the highway interstate
Had a holdup on the freeway we end up being late
Flew into Chicago but we never heard the blues
Played some rock 'n' roll there then down to Batton Rouge
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
Right on through the USA
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
Right on through the USA
Fought the vigilante at the end of our first tour
We made a lot of friends there we'll see them all next year
As we fought the big deadline, oh, we won't forget the days
We rode the silver eagle right across the USA
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
Right on through the USA
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
Right on through the USA
Midnight rider
