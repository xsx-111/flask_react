Never Surrender LyricsI was born on the back streets
On the rotten side of town
I never had me nothin'
Just people puttin' me down
Living on the dark side
Across the railroad track
Leaving wasn't easy
But I'm never going back
Never surrender
When you're up against the world
Never surrender
Stand up fight them all
Never surrender
When you're up against the world
Never surrender
Stand up fight them all
I'm sticking in the fast lane
I never wanna quit
I'm taking all my chances
I'm gonna take 'em quick
I started at the bottom
But I'm headed to the top
Ain't nobody gonna hold me back
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
Never surrender
When you're up against the world
Never surrender
Stand up fight them all
Never surrender
When you're up against the world
Never surrender
Stand up fight them all
I was born on the back streets
On the rotten side of town
I never had me nothin'
Just people puttin' me down
I'm living on the darkside
Across the railroad track
Leaving wasn't easy
But I'm never going back
Never surrender
When you're up against the world
Never surrender
Stand up fight them all
