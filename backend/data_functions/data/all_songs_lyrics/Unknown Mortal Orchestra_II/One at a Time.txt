One at a Time Lyrics
I'm only floating on the breeze
Sweet dreams are falling from the trees
I'm on my knees
I'm fumbling through my pockets for my keys
One at a time, mama please

I'm only lonely through the night
I'm sweating, fretting through the flight
I'm out of sight
I'm crying, I am flying like a kite
One at a time, out of sight

One at a time
One at a time
One at a time
One at a time

I'm only floating on the breeze
Sweet dreams are falling from the trees
I'm on my knees
I'm fumbling through my pockets for my keys
One at a time, mama please
I'm only lonely through the nightEmbed
