The Opposite of Afternoon Lyrics
Overcast in the good of the night, it's alright
Moles are crashing out of the dirt
Oil is in the cradle of its golden moon tonight
Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon

Overcast in the good of the night, it's alright
Moles are crashing out of the dirt
Oil is in the cradle of its golden moon tonight
Open eyes in the gardens of sight, it's alright
Only when you crawl in the dirt
Frozen invitations to a solvent gloom tonight

Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon

Only gods in a mountain at night, it's alright
Fools and molten virgins alike
Rolling in the naked and the fragrant doom tonight
Solarizing a portrait of light, it's alright
Woven sparkled cotton and void
Open elevation of the cult of... tonight
Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon
Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon

Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon
Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon3Embed
