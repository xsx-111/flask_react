Monki Lyrics
He wants to give her everything she wants
All of the sins in her mind
All of her enemies fallen and cryin'
All of the tear drops on her tongue

It's in her conscience
That whatever God gives
Her someone to mourn
Who cares what God is?
Or what a guitar is?
Or that you were born?

Monki, Monki
He wanted you
Monki, Monki
He wanted you

And when he stops saying things you want to hear
Pull up your knickers in a mood
He wants to outclass these crass devotees
Deletes your picture from his phone
It's in his conscience
That musical notes give him
Someone to mourn
Who cares what God is?
Or what a guitar is?
Or that you were born?

Monki, Monki
She wanted you
Monki, Monki
She wanted you


It's in his conscience
That musical notes give him
Someone to mourn
Who cares what God is?
Or what a guitar is?
Or that you were born?

Monki, Monki
She wanted you
Monki, Monki
She wanted you5Embed
