Secret Xtians Lyrics
I'm going to hide from the rain
I am tired of running 'round while these nuns eat my grain
Ransacking, wolfpacking rats in a cult of fame, so lame
Secret Christians are all the same

Don't be grumpy and cold
If you want to, I can burn up a hole in this coal
Don't be surprised if it warms up right when we die tonight
Secret Christians are not too bright

Na na-na  na na na
Na na-na na na na
Na, na-na, na na-na, na
Na, na-na, na, na-na
Na, na na, na, na-na, na-na
Na na na-na-na-na  na-na na2Embed
