Fortune 500 Lyrics
I'm at the gates, I'm climbing over the wall
To trepan the Queen and burn the dogs in the hall
A trail of destruction, but at least it's a trail
I am compelled to take you by the throat
They sing in my ears and make me feel like I'm loved
I don't want this, I never spoke up enough
Think of the people that I'm doing it for
I know the ways that I have been a slave
I've done the things that I was here to do
My twin, my twin, my dragon twin goes hard

So ring the alarm, I'm in the palace garage
Fortune 500 like the back of my hand
I know I'm only living half of a life
They said that I should do this for my sons
So is this the lot or should I take out the king?
The queen of my island, just an animal thing
Limp as a doily flapping blood in the wings
They speak in ways I do not understand
They know I've come to isolate the mouths

I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won
Fortune 500 like the back of my hand
Fortune 500 like whatever you ask
I know the ways that I have been a slave
(I know the ways that I have been a slave)
I've done the things that I was here to do
(I've done the things that I was here to do)
I am compelled to take you by the throat
(I am compelled to take you by the throat)
They speak in ways I do not understand
(They speak in ways I do not understand)

I've won, I've won, they told me that I've won1Embed
