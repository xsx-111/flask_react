Regret Lyrics
Regret, regret
Regret, regret

First you'll see me on the news
Then never again (Regret, regret)
I'm rolling in my grave (Regret, regret)
Feeling like a grenade (Regret, regret)
Maybe you're the coldest (Regret, regret)
If you've never felt it (Regret, regret)
Maybe you're the luckiest (Regret, regret)
If you never did it (Regret, regret)

But did you imagine it
In a different way?
Did you imagine it
In a different way?

Did you ever watch your life
Slide out of your hands? (Regret, regret)
You wish it never had (Regret, regret)
But all of that's in the past (Regret, regret)
Maybe I'm a human (Regret, regret)
The "trying to click 'undo' man" (Regret, regret)
Or maybe an automaton (Regret, regret)
Oh, how'd it all go so wrong? (Regret, regret)
But did you imagine it
In a different way?
Did you imagine it
In a different way?
Did you think that everything
Everything would change?
Did you imagine it
In a different way?

Regret, regret (Ha-ha, ha-ha)
Regret, regret
Maybe you're the luckiest (Regret, regret)
If you never felt it (Regret, regret)

But did you imagine it
In a different way?
Did you imagine it
In a different way?
Did you think that everything
Everything would change?
Did you imagine it
In a different way?
