Zero Pharaoh Lyrics
They tell me there’s a Pharaoh in town
And now the town has gone to the dogs
They tell me he’s a household name
Only no-one has a house anymore

They tell me there’s a way to cheat death
And how you let him do what he wants
I bet you say he never does wrong
I don't know why you say it so much

If all your children made it out alive
Then why would you ever go back?
Take your Pharaoh, put him in the black sack
Why don’t you think for yourself?

You’re living in an overturned boat
You’re waiting for Valhalla to call
But every time you try to give blood
You somehow end up sucking it in

If all your children made it out alive
Then why would you ever go back?
Take your Pharaoh, put him in the black sack
Why don’t you smash him all up?
Give me the gun, give me the gun
Give me the gun, give me the gun
Give me the gun, give me the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun
Give me the gun, give me the gun
Give me the gun, give me the gun
Give me the gun, give me the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun

With all these riches boiling at your cold spit
Why would you ever say no? Oh, would you ever say no?
All this fire drenched over all of your foes
Then why would you ever say no? Oh, would you ever say no?
And all those people laying down their whole lives
Why won't you ever say no? Oh, would you ever say no?
I'll break your Pharaoh and throw him in the Red Sea
I’m gonna take it myself2Embed
