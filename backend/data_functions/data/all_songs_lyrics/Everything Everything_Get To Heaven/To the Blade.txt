To the Blade Lyrics
So you think there's no meaning
In anything that we do?
Maybe it's the silence
Maybe it's the war
Try to understand it
Try your best to understand the world
You're bleeding down the highway
You just want to listen to the road
Well, you called him a liar
And you called him a piece of dirt
And never can you take it back and
Never can you make it right
In the final seconds
I think he knew everything you are
A plague on the horizon
In the cold arena where you're

Trapped
In the moment you met
In the lifetime alive
What you said wasn't loud enough, but you did know how
Ooh
You can take it from me
There's a light in your eyes
There's a thing that you're always saying and it is no words
And they called you a witness
And they called you the next of kin
Maybe you don't hear their questions
Or you don't want to take it in
No one saw it coming
Nobody could see the underside
He was straighter than an arrow
Pointed at a target in his mind
And his bow was his anger
But his blade was this cursed time
He didn't want to be your prisoner
Any more than you'd be mine
Try to know the difference
Sleep until you see it lift away
I'll be waiting for you
A reservoir between us, 'cause you're

Trapped
In the moment you met
In the lifetime alive
What you said wasn't loud enough, but you did know how
Ooh
You can take it from me
There's a light in your eyes
There's a thing that you're always saying and it is no words

Yes
It's the back of your mind
It's the hand of a god
It's the thought that you might have done it but you can't know why
Ooh
Don't you waste any life
There's a truth in the blood
There's a thing he was always saying and it is no words7Embed
