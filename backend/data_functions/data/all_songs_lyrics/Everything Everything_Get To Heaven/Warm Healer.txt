Warm Healer Lyrics
We got ourselves another one
We got ourselves another Jane Doe, (Ooo-ooh) Doe (Aaa-ah)
I never let the others go
But every time I look around they (Aaa-ah) form (Ooo-ooh)
See the shadow-men bow down to
The head of a baby calf, calf
If it isn’t love then why do
I feel that I’m split in half, half, half, half?

Babe, don’t look the other way
I love your face and there’s no more time
Babe, I saw what you did tonight
It’s ugly but it is all I want
Babe, they call me the medicine man
But my old spells don’t work anymore
Don’t ask for me tomorrow, kid
I think you’ll only find a grave man, (Ooo-ooh) man (Aaa-ah)
Just take a look outside the walls
And try to tell me something that’s good (Aaa-ah) now (Ooo-ooh)
'Round my neck I feel some great weight
The Chupacabra clings on, on
That’s the rhythm my Pigdog loves
It’s gotta mean something's wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
Babe, don’t look the other way
I love your face and there’s no more time
Babe, I saw what you did tonight
It’s ugly but it is all I want
Babe, they call me the medicine man
But my old spells don’t work anymore

(Take aim)


Babe, I saw what you did tonight
It’s ugly but it is all I want
Babe, you don't want me sucking you down
What's all that young life been wasted on?2Embed
