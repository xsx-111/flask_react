Distant Past Lyrics
Drag my tongue across the sand
So happy just to crawl across the land
Soon I'll be the best around
I'm gonna keep my plunder underground
Hard flesh, cold against the rain
Dust billowing around my brazen brain
Saw off all my stinking limbs
Blood dripping down my sunken monkey chin

Baby, can you leave it in the (Distant past)?
Baby, can you leave it in the (Distant past)?
Girl, I'm from the very, very (Distant past)
Girl, I'm from the very, very (Distant past)
Baby, can you leave me in the (Distant past)?
Baby, can you leave me in the (Distant past)?
Girl, I wanna take you to the (Distant past)
Girl, I wanna take you to the (Distant past)

Take me to the distant past, I want to go back
(Distant past, distant past)
Save me from the distant past, I want this so bad
(Distant past, distant past)
Take me to the distant past, I want to go back
(Distant past, distant past)
Save me from the distant past, I want this so bad
(Distant past)
Two thumbs, I cross the Rubicon
Slack-jawed, but you’ll never be passing it on
Plug hole, down the drain you go
Your body never made it past the snow
Canine fangs up out my throat
You're bleeding over Eden like a goat
Tall blade, a triffid in every field
I'm blooming like a fuming human shield

Baby, can you leave it in the (Distant past)?
Baby, can you leave it in the (Distant past)?
Girl, I'm from the very, very (Distant past)
Girl, I'm from the very, very (Distant past)
Baby, can you leave me in the (Distant past)?
Baby, can you leave me in the (Distant past)?
Girl, I wanna take you to the (Distant past)
Girl, I wanna take you to the (Distant past)

Take me to the distant past, I want to go back
(Distant past, distant past)
Save me from the distant past, I want this so bad
(Distant past, distant past)
Take me to the distant past, I want to go back
(Distant past, distant past)
Save me from the distant past, I want this so bad
(Distant past, distant past)
Past, the past
I’m back, I’m bad
The past (Crom), the past
(Distant, dis–, distant, dis–, distant
Distant, dis–, distant, –tant past
Distant, dis–, dis–, distant past)
Stop, start something
Start, get better
Stop, just leave nothing
Stars, sky

Take me to the distant past, I want to go back
(Distant past, distant past)
Save me from the distant past, I want this so bad
(Distant past, distant past)13Embed
