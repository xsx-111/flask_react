The Wheel (Is Turning Now) Lyrics
"He held my hand when I died"
"He told me all I could ask"
The politician bleats so blind
With his hard hat on rotating in a circle
"Gimme some rosacea, nicotine to stain ya"
Boys on the altar waiting to be crushed

(You wanna know)
But as he takes the stage I'm gone
(You wanna know)
Oh, what the hell is all this?

Oh, is it in the way he calls your name? (Calls your name)
Or is it in the way he prays for rain? (Prays for rain)
The wheel is turning now (It's really turning now)
It's really turning now

Bone, to the blade
My letter, white feather, no halves
"Dread," that's what the devil said
My prison, my prison, my guard
"He laid his hands upon me"
"He took a hold of my life"
The terror and the old blood screech
"When you mix those colours, something's gonna happen
I don't wanna see them, I don't wanna know them"
I spasm on the floor and wait for it to end

(You wanna know)
But as he throws the crutches down
(You wanna know)
Eleven-thousand knees bent let them know you're coming

Oh, is it in the way he calls your name? (Calls your name)
Or is it in the way he makes you pray? (Makes you pray)
The wheel is turning now (It's really turning now)
It's really turning now

Do you wanna know how far you've come?
Do you wanna know how far you've come?
Do you have any idea?
Do you have any ideas?
Do you wanna know how far you've come?
Do you wanna know how far you've come?
Do you have any idea?
Do you have any ideas?7Embed
