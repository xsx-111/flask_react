Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread Lyrics
A holy man with a pale, yellow liver
Crossed my palm on the banks of the river
On the banks of the river

The hands loom heavy with only an hour to go
I hold my breath but the seekers will find me
Priest and pauper, the leper, uh
Can't change his spots, the King knows, and I know it, eh
And everybody knows

Spring, sun, winter, dread
I don't want to get older (No way, no way)
Spring, sun, winter, dread
I don't want to get older (No way, no way)

Are those my people, or are they barbarians all?
I need a shoulder to talk to about it
Swing the hammer, the fragments, eh
A skull exploded on you, on all you
And showers on the infant's bed

Spring, sun, winter, dread
I don't want to get older (No way, no way)
Spring, sun, winter, dread
I don't want to get older (No way, no way)
Spring, sun, winter, dread
I don't want to get older (No way, no way)
Spring, sun, winter, dread
I don't want to get older (No way, no way)
You are a thief and a murderer too
Stole the face that you wear from a craven baboon
’Cause you did it to her, and you did it to him
And you did it before and you'll do it again, I know it
You are a thief and a murderer too
Stole the face that you wear from a craven baboon
’Cause you did it to her, and you did it to him
And you did it before and you'll do it again, I know it
You are a thief and a murderer too
Stole the face that you wear from a craven baboon
’Cause you did it to her, and you did it to him
And you did it before and you'll do it again, I saw it
You are a thief and a murderer too
Stole the face that you wear from a craven baboon
’Cause you did it to her, and you did it to him
And you did it before and you'll do it again, I know it
You are a thief and a murderer too
Stole the face that you wear from a craven baboon
’Cause you did it to her, and you did it to him
And you did it before and you'll do it again, I know it
You are a thief and a murderer too
Stole the face that you wear from a craven baboon
’Cause you did it to her, and you did it to him
And you did it before and you'll do it again4Embed
