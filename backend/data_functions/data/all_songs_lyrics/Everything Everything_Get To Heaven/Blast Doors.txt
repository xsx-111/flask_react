Blast Doors Lyrics
You can tell the past, boy, I can tell the future
Give me a lobotomy and I can be your tutor
Open up the blast doors, then we can be neutered
I can smell your fingerprints all over my computer
So give me all the black-brown, sticky sugar water
Swing you by your neck, mama, this can be your future
Something very strange about your picture in the mirror
When you move, it doesn't move, now how could that be weirder?
Just keep on rubbernecking, yeah, whatever feels familiar
I can send my brain on a holiday forever
You can fire a rocket at a rocket, it's the future
If you weren't already dead, I wouldn't have to school ya

You say you're gonna change, yeah
But you don't have any time, yeah
Down in my beast heart, I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind, I open my wild eye
Down in my beast heart, I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind, I open my wild eye

Go tell it to the plain-clothed officer behind us
What are you, a master of disguise and keeping silent?
Drop another depth charge, coiling like a viper
Eyes so close together make it harder for the sniper
Shoot a starving porno for the yuppies in a circle
Second death upon you, swimming backwards like a turtle
Man, I really trusted you, I thought you were civilian
I could shove a magnet in your mouth and make a million
So did you pack your bag, or did somebody pack it for you?
Take me to the sad, sad party that you're bound to
Whether you're a 'have-not' or a 'have', I got a question
Are you living dead, or is this some kind of possession?
You say you’re gonna change, yeah
But you don’t have any time, yeah

Down in my beast heart, I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind, I open my wild eye
Down in my beast heart, I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind, I open my wild eye
Down in my beast heart, I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind, I open my wild eye
Down in my beast heart, I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind, I

I hear the death rattle of a time wasted
Time wasted
You know that I believe in it
You know that I believe in it
But I'm wasted

Oh, you say you’re gonna change, yeah
But you don’t have any time, yeah
You say you’re gonna change, yeah
But you don’t have any time, yeah
(Beast heart, empire)
(Blind I, wild eye)
Down in my beast heart, I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind, I open my wild eye
Down in my beast heart, I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind, I open my wild eye
Down in my beast heart, I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind, I6Embed
