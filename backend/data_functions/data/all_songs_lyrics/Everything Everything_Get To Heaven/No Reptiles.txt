No Reptiles Lyrics
Slip from the trees to the dirt to the menace
To the wild to the car, under snow, cut to ribbons
Like a coral to your shin, like a manacle to swing
Fresh from the breast, now a river running fat
To the manor born a rat, to the manor born a flea
To a flood to a drain, now a rubber, now a chain

I was in the war
You were in the war

Plump from the sugar-water pump
With the city at your back to the cannon with a match
From a milk into a mass grave
Never mind that, I can take that
Bones in a bowl like a toad-in-the-hole
Take the shape of the mould
Like a mummy on a pole and a merry little head
Bob around when you're dead

I was on my knees
You were on your knees
And no reptiles
Just soft boiled eggs in shirts and ties
Waiting for the flashing green man
Quivering and wobbling just like all the eggs you know

I’m going to kill a stranger
So don’t you be a stranger

Oh baby, it’s alright
It’s alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair
Old enough to run
Old enough to fire a gun
Oh baby, it’s alright
It’s alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair
Old enough to run
Old enough to fire a gun
Oh baby, it’s alright
It’s alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair
Old enough to run
Old enough to fire a gun

Just give me this one night
Just one night to feel like I might be on the right path
The path that takes me home
Wise enough to know myself
Just give me this one night
Just one night to feel like I might be on the right path (Home)
Old enough to fire a gun
Just give me this one night
Just one night to feel like I might be on the right path
The path that takes me home
Wise enough to know myself
Just give me this one night
Just one night to feel10Embed
