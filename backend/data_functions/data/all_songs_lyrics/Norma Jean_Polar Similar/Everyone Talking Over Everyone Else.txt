Everyone Talking Over Everyone Else Lyrics
Sit and listen to the voices fade
(and sing again)
Give them space to destroy it all
(and build again)
Fill the space with the lies you shed
(and start again)
Every sorrow, every misery
Can and will be brought to life
If you put it in a story or a lie
Every sentence that you recognize
Every word of every kind
But I was waking up
I am stronger now
Every influential interview
I was in between the lies
But I was waking up, I am stronger now

Sit and listen to the voices fade
(and sing again)
Give them space to destroy it all
Every picture, every photograph
I was disappearing lines
But I was showing up in the center of life
Sit and listen to the voices fade
Sit and listen to the voices fade
Sit and listen to the voices fade
Every motion
Every point of view
I was always giving up
But I have woken up
Every time of day
Sit and listen to the voices fade
(Sit and listen to the voices fade)
Sit and listen to the voices fadeEmbed
