IV. The Nexus LyricsWe've all heard them say
“It takes one to know one”
“It takes one to know one”
“It takes one to know one”
Well small lies are big lies and we've all told both
The whole world is wounded
While you stand around
And heal like an angel
You might think all of this sounds so crazy
But we want to fall where there are padded walls
I don't wanna be inside while the walls are closing in
If you want to make this all work then you're gonna have to try
One word said softly and perseverant
Is the twin of an outright speech
But lies always travel faster than the truth is said
Lies always travel faster than the truth is said
But the lies always travel faster than the truth is said
The lies always travel faster than the truth is said
Truth is said
We've all heard them say
“It takes one to know one”
“It takes one to know one”
Yeah
Cause I don't wanna be inside while the walls are closing in
If you want to make this all work then you're gonna have to try
I don't wanna be inside while the walls are closing in
If you want to make this all work then you're gonna have to try
We've all heard them say
(The whole world is wounded)
(The whole world is wounded)
(The whole world is wounded)

I found your house
I heard you lived here
I found your window
So I approached it
I welcomed your presence
I had a box there
So I opened it
Inside was a piece of paper with a name written on it
It was
It was yoursEmbed
