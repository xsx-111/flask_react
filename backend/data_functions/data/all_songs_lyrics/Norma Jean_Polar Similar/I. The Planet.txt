I. The Planet LyricsI hope you burn
I'll be the king of the ash
I hope you burn
I'll be the king of the ashes
What you're feeling is the loneliness of God
What you're feeling is the loneliness of God
I hope you burn
I'll be the king of the ash
I hope you burn
I'll be the king of the ashes
What you're feeling is the loneliness of God
What you're feeling is the loneliness of God
What you're feeling is the loneliness of God
What you're feeling is the loneliness
Loneliness of God2Embed
