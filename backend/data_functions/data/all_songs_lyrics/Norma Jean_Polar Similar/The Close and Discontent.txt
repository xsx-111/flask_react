The Close and Discontent LyricsWe don't need to hash out anything
When your friendship death toll says it all
It swims like a shark cutting through
Blood inked waters, safe from sight
Clouded in blood and seeking a leg to sink its teeth into
So sorry to tell you I'm leaving this sea never to return
And all of this time I'm
Just trying to tell you this one thing
Don't bring me into this
Don't bring me into this
I wish you well, yeah
Clouded in blood and seeking a leg to sink its teeth into
So sorry to tell you I'm leaving this sea never to return
And all of this time I'm
Just trying to tell you this one thing
Please don't bring me into this
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish youEmbed
