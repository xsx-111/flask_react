Death Is a Living Partner LyricsSomeone take me down to the river
And leave no trail for which to return
Let the muddy water fill my lungs
Fill my lungs
And leave no trail for which to return
Let the muddy water fill my lungs
Fill my lungs
Fill my lungs
Fill my lungs
The invincibility of our youth has just given away
(And I hope it does)
To the inevitability of our death, yeah
The invincibility of our youth has just given away
(And I hope it does)
To the inevitability of our death
So don't raise your glass
Don't raise your glass
Don't raise your glass
Redemption wears a red dress but carries a white flag
I'll wear that red dress for you
The invincibility of our youth has just given away
(And I hope it does)
To the inevitability of our death, of our death
The invincibility of our youth has just given away
(And I hope it does)
To the inevitability of our death
So don't raise your glass
Don't raise your glass
Death is a living partner
A consummate consummate one
A consummate consummate one
Consummate consummate one
Consummate consummate oneEmbed
