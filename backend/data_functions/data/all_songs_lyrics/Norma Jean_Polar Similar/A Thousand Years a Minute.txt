A Thousand Years a Minute LyricsI am just a sensory of what I've said and done
This is what I tell myself to pacify the room
“I suppose living like this is good to you?”
I'm taking what you're giving but the giving takes away
Is that what you came for?
Is that what you came for?
Yeah
This is what I tell myself to pacify the room
“I suppose living like this is good to you?”
I'm taking what you're giving but the giving takes away
Is that what you came for?
Is that what you, is that what you
I should really go backwards like you do
If I wanted to start over again
I don't want to be like you, like you do
I don't want to embrace my ghosts again
Once, twice, and every desperate time
Once, twice, and every desperate time
So you wanted to live (Once, twice, and every desperate time)
Is that what you came for?
So you wanted to die (Once, twice, and every desperate time)
Is that what you came for?
So you wanted to live (Once, twice)
Is that what you came for?
So you wanted to live
Is that what you came for?
So you wanted to die
Once, twice, and every desperate time
And every desperate time
Is that what you came for?
Try not to fall into the dark again
So try, try, try, try
Try not to fall into the dark again
So try, try, try, try
Try not to fall into the dark again
So try, try, try
I should really go backwards like you do
If I wanted to start over again
I don't want to be like you, like you do
I don't want to embrace my ghosts again
Is that what you came for?
Is that what you came for?
