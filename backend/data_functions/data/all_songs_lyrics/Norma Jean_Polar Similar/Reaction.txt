Reaction Lyrics
Reaction!

You're acting like
You don't sympathize
With anything at all
Or anyone for any reason
You're desperate to fill the space

And that makes me a weight
Pulling you away
I just made a decision
This condition is only what you made
Its calling out your name
I just want a reaction
A reaction
Reaction from you!
(Reaction from you!)

Negatives and positives will drift
Contained on whispered avenues
So run
Get out while you can
Break a lot of glass
Leave the place in shambles
Be careful of what you leave behind
You will walk across companies of friends
And accumulate all the pieces that you lost
You have to know
I sympathize with you

And that makes me a weight
Pulling you away
I just made a decision
This condition is only what you made
Its calling out your name
I just want a reaction
A reaction
Reaction from you!

Breathing down your neck
I just made a decision
This condition is only what you made
Its calling out your name
I just want a reaction
A reaction
Reaction from you!
Reaction from you!Embed
