1,000,000 Watts Lyrics
Yeah!

If you wanna speak of the devil
You will feel the wave of his or her invented wings
We see the shadow of the axe before
It falls on the necks of the sheep
But if the light has a secret shade
I am the lamb that has become the wolf
Yeah!
1,000,000 watts because I'm feeling alive
But you're broken on the inside, baby
And that will never have the final say

I feel bad that you're angry
But I'm sorry
I don't care for what it's worth
If it ever comes down to me or you
You're probably going to die

So take yourself outside
And be alone to meditate with a cigarette
We see the shadow of the axe before
It falls on the necks of the sheep
But if the light has a secret shade
I am the lamb that is becoming the wolf
I feel bad that you're angry
But I'm sorry
I don't care for what it's worth
If it ever comes down to me or you
You're probably going to die

Words of war become acts of war
War!
Words of war become acts of war
Come on
Yeah!
Words of war become acts of war

I'm not fucking around
Yeah!
One million watts because I feel alive
You're broken, broken
One million watts because I feel alive
But you're broken on the inside, baby
And they will never have the final say
They will never have the final say
They will never have the final say
I feel bad that you're angry
But I'm sorry
I don't care for what it's worthEmbed
