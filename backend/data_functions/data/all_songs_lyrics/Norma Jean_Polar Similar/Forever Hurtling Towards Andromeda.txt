Forever Hurtling Towards Andromeda LyricsYou said love nothing
And nothing that you love can be used against you
But if you're trying to save me
Then you'll have to try harder
The sound is an infinite saint
That brings me to its knees

To find my way through space
Hurtling like a comet
To find my way through space
But if you're trying to save me
Then you'll have to try harder
If you're trying to save me
Then you'll have to try

To find my way through space
Hurtling like a comet
To find my way through space
Hey
You've fallen on your dreams
They're running like a river
And sounding like a stream
We save for opposite ears
It doesn't matter what we say
It doesn't matter what we say
What has to, does!
Does!
What has to, does!
What has to, does!
What has to, does!
What has to, does!Embed
