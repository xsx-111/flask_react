An Ocean of War Lyrics
This is a break up scene
You're livin' like a cinematic dream
This is a break up scene
You're livin' like a cinematic
This is a break up scene
You're livin' like a cinematic dream
This is a break up scene
You're livin' like a cinematic

Just give me a chance to say everything
You're not thinking it through at all
Like you never saw it coming
This is not an opening
So just give me a chance to say
We never saw us coming
But if you wanted to leave me
All you had to do was ask (If I want to be the guesser of you)
If you say you're my darling
I'm gonna throw up and die (If I want to be the guesser of me)
Everything is under control

This is a break up scene
You're livin' like a cinematic dream
This is a break up scene
You're livin' like a cinematic
Everything is under control

Just give me a chance to say everything
You're not thinking it through at all
Like you never saw it coming
This is not an opening
So just give me a chance to say
We never saw us coming
But if you wanted to leave me
All you had to do was ask (If I want to be the guesser of you)
If you say you're my darling
I'm gonna throw up and die (If I want to be the guesser of me)

This is a break up scene
You're livin' like a cinematic dream
This is a break up scene
You're livin' like a cinematic dream
Does it hurt you to know that it does not hurt me at all?
At all?Embed
