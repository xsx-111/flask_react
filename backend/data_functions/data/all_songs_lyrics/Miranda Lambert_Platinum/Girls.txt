Girls Lyrics
Imagine a fighter with a centerfold face
Comes from a long line of blue collars and lace
With a grip like reigns to a steed and kisses for days
And imagine a winner holding pink champagne
Who stills loves her daddy but changes her name
An overachiever, even she don't believe her own fame

You can't change her mind (Even if you wanted to)
You can always try (She'll through you, she'll see through you)
If you think she's the only one that she'll want in this world
Then you don't know 'bout nothing about girls

Imagine you're best friend and you're worst enemy
Begs you to stay and then wishes you'd leave
Like Marilyn Monroe she can be who you want her to be

You can't change her mind (Even if you wanted to)
You can always try (She'll through you, she'll see through you)
If you think she's the only one that she'll want in this world
Then you don't know 'bout nothing about girls

Go on, go on
Give her everything and more
Love her all you want
She was never yours
You can't change her mind
You can always try
If you think you're the only one that she'll want in this world
Then you don't know 'bout nothing about girls
If you think you're the only one that she'll want in this world
Then you don't know nothing
Know nothing
