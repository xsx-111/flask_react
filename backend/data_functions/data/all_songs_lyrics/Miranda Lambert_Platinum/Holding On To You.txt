Holding On To You LyricsI've seen the south of France
I've seen the sunset dance
Over Sunset Avenue
I've seen the Rolling Stones
Got real high on rock 'n' roll
Seen a lot of dreams come true
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding onto you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding onto you
Baby over the years
I've been moved to tears
By the wonders of this old world
One of God's mysteries
It never fails to get to me
Is the moment when I'm holding onto you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding onto you
I've seen a newborn child
Puts stars in her mama's eyes
And I pray to the man in the moon
I got drunk with the Highwaymen
Felt the burn of the desert wind
Seen some promising I do's
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding onto you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding onto you
Baby over the years
I've been moved to tears
By the wonders of this old world
One of God's mysteries
It never fails to get to me
Is the moment when I'm holding onto you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding onto you
Baby we just rolled in
It's cold here in Michigan
Got a sold-out show tonight
Pretty soon we'll hit the stage
I'll feel the lights hit my face
We'll see some magic in the room
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding onto you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding onto you
No no no no
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding onto you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding onto youEmbed
