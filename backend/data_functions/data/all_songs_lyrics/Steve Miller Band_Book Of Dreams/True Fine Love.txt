True Fine Love Lyrics
I ain't complaining
But I'd sure like to find me
A true, fine love
Someone another
That's as sweet as your mother
A true, fine love

'Cause the time is right
For walking in the moonlight
I have suddenly found I'm ready to settle down
So come on, get your rocks off
I'm gonna knock your socks off
You'll see, oh yeah
So come on, pretty baby
We're going to raise a family

There'll be no hesitating
'Cause I'm so tired of waiting
For a true, fine love
Someone another
Like a sister or brother
A true, fine love
'Cause the time is right
For walking in the moonlight
I have suddenly found I'm ready to settle down
So come on, get your rocks off
I'm gonna knock your socks off
You'll see, oh yeah
So come on, pretty baby
We're gonna raise a family

I ain't complaining
But I'd sure like to find me
A true, fine love
Someone another
That's as sweet as your mother
A true, fine love

'Cause the time is right
For walking in the moonlight
I have suddenly found I'm ready to settle down
We'll have a boy for you, we'll have a girl for me
Come on, baby, raise a family
So come on get your socks off
I'm gonna knock your rocks off1Embed
