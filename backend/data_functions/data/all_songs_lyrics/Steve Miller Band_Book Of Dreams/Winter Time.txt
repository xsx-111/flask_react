Winter Time Lyrics
In the winter time
When all the leaves are brown
And the wind blows (So chill)
And the birds have all flown for the summer
I'm calling, hear me calling, hear me calling

In the winter time
When all the leaves are brown
And the wind blows (So chill)
And the birds have all flown for the summer
I'm calling, hear me calling, hear me calling
I'm calling, hear me calling, hear me calling
In the winter time

In the winter time
When all the leaves are brown
And the wind blows (So chill)
And the birds have all flown for the summer
I'm calling, hear me calling, hear me calling1Embed
