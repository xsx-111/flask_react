Earthfriend Lyrics

You can move out mountains
You can talk to the sea
You can laugh at the people
But you can't laugh at me

All the afternoon shadows
All the darkness of night
Didn't think it all ???

The roads are imagination
They made it that way
The dark clouds are happy
The Sun's yellow waves

All the afternoon shadows
All the darkness of night
Didn't think it all ???
Ohh...

You can move out mountains
You can take time standstill
You can laugh at the people
But you can't undo a hill

All the afternoon shadows
All the darkness of night
Didn't think it all ???
