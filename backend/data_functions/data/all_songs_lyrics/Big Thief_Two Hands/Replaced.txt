Replaced Lyrics
Move along through Santa Fe
And  make a new beginning
What's  that you were starting to say?
Or have you forgotten?

'Cause, 'cause the unlit moon would rather hide
Be  replaced by the mystery of the stars
Because  in your room, we gather
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart

Pull  on your new wool coat
Try to remember the words you once wrote
The canyons that catch in your throat
The fault lines that carry and cradle the river

'Cause,  'cause the unlit moon would rather hide
And be replaced by the mystery of the stars
Because in your room, we gather
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart (Go on, now)

Because, because the unlit moon would rather hide
Be replaced by the mystery of the stars
Because in your room, we gather
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart
To be replaced by the mysteryEmbed
