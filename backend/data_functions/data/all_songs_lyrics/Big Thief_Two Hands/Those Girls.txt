Those Girls Lyrics
Dropped call, mid fall
Only you can know for now
Island, demons
Only you can hold them down

Those girls might hear me crying
The one, the only jealousy I have is dying
With all along, your arms around me
Try

Island, demons
ZoÃ«, you come over now
'Cause those girls keep telling me things
And only you can hold them down

Those girls might hear me crying
The one, the only jealousy I have is dying
With all along, your arms around me
Try

Those girls might hear me cry
The one, the only jealousy I have is dying
With all along, your arms around me
