Rock and Sing Lyrics
Without his body
Naked and bare
Quiet and obviously not there
I am that naked thing swimming in air
Why does that mean anything?
Why do you stare?

Lean on your table
Ask what you want of me
I am unable
Cry with me, cry with me

Within this body
Confuse
Confuse my home for a refuge
I don't want to be scared of (I don't want to be scared of)
Anybody coming in (Anybody coming in)
I don't want to lock my door anymore

Hand me that cable
Plug into anything
I am unstable
Rock and sing‚ rock and singEmbed
