Two Hands Lyrics
You somehow let me down
Both hands and a gentleman
You could not take me through
New plans or tell me who
New friends, I can make some too
I know
You somehow took me in
Both arms, my marked up skin
Two hands, places you had been
I needed

And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny

Now you call my bluff
All clear and it gets so rough
Stone-faced in the light
The air and the jagged bite
Cold air, the wisdom of the night
Between us
And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny
To deny, deny, deny

Somehow we exist
In the folds, and now we'll kiss
Both hands, the mystery before us
She's reaching
But I could not take you through
New plans, or tell you who
New friends, you can make some too
I knowEmbed
