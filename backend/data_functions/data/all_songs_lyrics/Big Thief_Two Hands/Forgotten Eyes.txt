Forgotten Eyes Lyrics
Forgotten eyes are the ones which we lose
Forgotten hands are the ones which we choose
To let go of, but it is no less a bruise
On the collective arm keeping us high and gone
Forgotten dance is the one left at birth
Forgotten plants in the fossils of earth
And they've long passed but they are no less the dirt
Of the common soil keeping us dry and warm

The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection‚ hmm-mm

Hollow-eyed on Eddie Street‚ no sirens to hear
Just trash and soiled needles clawing the veneer
And no crying but it is no less a tear
On the common cheek with which we smile
Hollow-eyed on Eddie‚ is it they or is it I?
Is it me who is more hollow as I'm quickly passing by?
And the poison is killing them, but then so am I
As I turn away

The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection, hmm-mm
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
