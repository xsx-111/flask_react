Shoulders Lyrics
Please wake up
Please wake up
Touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You brought me in
You brought me in
So touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You showed me how
To keep myself from burning out

They found you in the morning
The blood was on your shoulders
They found you at the corner
Your head was doubled over
And the blood of the man
Who killed my mother with his hands
Is in me, it's in me, in my veins

Please wake up
Please wake up
Touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You brought me in
My best friend
So touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You showed me how
To hold my sin
And kiss the bad ways I have been
They found you in the morning
The blood was on your shoulders
They found you at the corner
Your head was doubled over
And the blood of the man
Who's killing our mother with his hands
Is in me, it's in me, in my veins
It's in me, it's in me, in my veinsEmbed
