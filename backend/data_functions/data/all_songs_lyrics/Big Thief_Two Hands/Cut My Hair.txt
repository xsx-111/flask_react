Cut My Hair LyricsPlease cut my hair
Take  me to the kitchen
What  are the chances you have a scissor?
Maybe a pair?
It's longer than I can even bear
You  wanna be alone
Use  your ammunition to empty your arm
You ask me to leave you, I won't
Not  while the knife is at your throat
Annie reminds me
The diamond mines are burning
I push her around
But  she keeps returning
Teeth drool and bared
Make a clean incision, hold me for ransom
Tell me I'm pretty, tell me I'm rare
Talk to the boy in me, he's there
We do-si-do
Swaying in the kitchen, rocking slowly
Tell him to sound the alarm
Is he gonna keep me safe from harm?
Annie reminds me
The diamond mines are burning
I push her around
But she keeps returningEmbed
