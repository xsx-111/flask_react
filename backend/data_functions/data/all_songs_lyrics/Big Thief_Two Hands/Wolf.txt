Wolf LyricsHello to the morning moon
Woke up as you left the room
Pillow still warm
Scent like meadow grass
Has the feeling come to pass?
Has the feeling come to stay?
What can we say?
Wishing you would hang around
Living on the waterfront
Witnessing the gameless hunt
Mermaids don't kill
That's the way they sing so fine
Now your lips are on the line
Now there is a broken tongue
Met you so young
Felt so frozen
How you seem to follow through
On everything you yearn for
Steps so fair
So much certainty
Now as far as we can see
The water's getting deeper
My safekeeper
The wolf is howling for me
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
When she holds me in her jaw
All my blood dripping
Will I be free
To cease gripping?
Finally laying on the ground
Open hands empty
I'll return back again
If she'll let me
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, oohEmbed
