Big Dogs Lyrics
Def Squad, Wu-Tang, haha
Uh-huh, yeah
Yeah (Yo, yo), uh
Yo, yo-yo (Yeah, word up, uh)
Yo, yo-yo (Redman, uh)
Yo, yo (Iron Lung)
Yo, yo-yo-yo (Word), yo-yo, yo, yo-yo
E-Dub uh, word, yo

Call us guerillas of the mist, raunchy vocalists
Your code name? Doc, what's your name? Hot Nicks
Who them slick kids puffin' that shit, holdin' they dicks?
Yo, them same two drivin' your whip, fuckin' your bitch
Hold me down, son, yo, I hold you down with the pound
You got a lot of biscuits, ayo, but where they at now?
Diggy-down-down, we Reservoir Dogs, you puppy chow-chow
Got my mittens on the kitten, making it meow-meow
Yo, we bring the beef to you infested with the mad cow disease
We set to load, cock and squeeze
Boo-yah, we too hard to hold off
One arm slam ya like Nikolai Volkoff
When I dip-dip-dive, uh (Dive, uh), the anti-socializer ('Lizer)
Everything be ice cream, observe the Frusen Glädjé
We rock ya, knock ya fuckin' whole team off the roster
Starting lineup, Iron Lung and Funk Doctor
Stomp with the big dogs (Check it, check it out)
Stomp with the big dogs (Check it, check it out)
Stomp with the big dogs (Check it, check it out)
Stomp with the big dogs (Check it, check it out)

Johnny Blaze the Ghost Rider (Uh)
Ghost stories by the campfire (Uh), we nightbreed, vampire
Be duckin' from the head rushin' (Uh) Wu-Tang production (Uh)
Percussions bringin' repercussions (Uh) I hold my mic sideways bustin'
Another one bites the dust and (Uh)
Cardiac arrest clutchin' (Uh) your chest suckin' (Uh)
Your last breath, M-R, period, Meth
Niggas dyin' from paper cuts, bleedin' to death
Down these mean streets, Jonny Quest (Uh)
From ASCAP to NASDAQ, get that money sack (Uh)
These habitats ain't no place to raise a family at
These alley cats (Uh) be at war with these dirty rats (Uh)
So watch your back when you come to the slums (No)
There ain't nowhere to run from the Iron Lizza-Lung (Uh)
Phasers on stun, I be givin' it to son (Yeah)
My plague spares no one, my uzi weigh a ton (Word up, Meth yo)

Stomp with the big dogs (Check it, check it out)
Stomp with the big dogs (Check it, check it out)
Stomp with the big dogs (Check it, check it out)
Stomp with the big dogs (Check it, check it out)
We're on the move (Check it, check it out)
We're on the move (Check it, check it out)
We're on the move (Check it, check it out), stomp with the big dogs
We're on the move (Check it, check it out, yeah, dynamic duo, uh)

Pon cock, the Don Juan Doc
Send crews back to the shoeshine box, connect the dots
My description, Black male, yellowed and mellow
I make it hard for MCs to run neck and elbow
With D-O, penal code, Deebo knows
To duck when he hear the bike with the squeaky clutch
Swallow this hard act to follow
You could parachute off my slang and use my rhymes to toggle
I'm tense, so smooth I can't be fingerprinted
I stomp harder in slow motion (Den-den, den-den-den)
Yo, fuck your applaud, bitches still rush me
Like they rushed the store before Soul Train Awards
Incorporate a law, whoever ain't raw get they hand chopped
By Jamal with the Wu sword (Ooh-whee)
My crew specialize in snakin' your bitch
Robbin' you while you on the floor, shakin' and shit
I'm doin' me, now do you (Yo, who you?), Doc
I bomb shit 'til the conflict's crucial, I
Be the Black El Niño, I mean, yo, I'm supreme
Like the team show, what you paid your cream for
(To see us sit down?) Yo, nah, we get the fuck up
(And leave the one you with) Then take her from Usher
That's right, six-double-o with chrome pipes
U.S. Marshals, out to pen us up like Snipes
(Throw it in drive) Fuck takin' me and Meth alive
(Ayo, you lick that-a-way) You lick out the other side
Uh, yeah, yeah2Embed
