Cheka Lyrics

Riggidy-raow! Steppin' out the crowd throwin' bolos
Fliggidy-flame on! Twin chrome fo'-fo's
Loadin' it up, cocking it back, ready to splash for real
Spit flows out the gill, God tried to build
It's hectic, 45-6 gimme a grip
That's more dollars in them thongs than them go-go chicks
Bitch I'm drunk, pumpin' slugs out of cannon
Shut ya after-party down when Meth and Red in
Check it, Bricks and Shaolin, no joke!
And when I hit the pussy call me Daddy Long Stroke
Oh Anna, I'm hittin' pigeons out in Atlanta
Banana split, hachoo, spit! (Oh shit!)
Sticking ya, ripping ya for all ya funds
I wet ya like a 141 water guns
Cock d' like Rocky, got you scared to death
So hold on you bitches, 'cause here come Red-Meth!

Microphone check, micro-microphone checka!
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka!
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka!
Fuck with me and Meth and we break ya fuckin neck-a (Remember this?)
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka! (Remember this?)
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka! (Remember this?)
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka! (Remember this?)
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka!
Okay to hey hey baby, me and Doc about to blow
My Saturday Nights are special and they're pointed at your nose
Ayy yo, save the speculations and the rumors
Comin' sooner than you think, I knock a fat bitch out her bloomers
Givin' tumors, hardcore, givin' it to 'em raw
Landshark, Southpaw, so kids say I Jabb-er-jaw
One, two, no ending or beginning to my cypher
I'm winning tell the news like Peter Jennings
Depending, on any given day I'm representing
The struggle, my great grand who lived through the lynching
Oh yes y'all, if you got the weed, who got the blunts?
Take a guess y'all, Kool-Aid bustin' through the wall
Mr. Meth y'all, ahh-chuu! Comment alllez-vous?
I used to hawk chickens, now I'm maxin' with Badu
I represent Wu, my uzi weighs a ton
I'm swingin' the track from Staten
'Cause Staten's where I'm from

Microphone check, micro-microphone checka!
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka!
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka!
Fuck with me and Meth and we break ya fuckin neck-a (Remember this?)
Microphone- heck, micro-microphone checka! (Remember this?)
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka! (Remember this?)
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka! (Remember this?)
Microphone check, micro-microphone checka!
