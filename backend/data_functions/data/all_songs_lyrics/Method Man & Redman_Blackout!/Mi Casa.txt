Mi Casa Lyrics
Whatchu crazy??!!? Since a buck tooth baby
Doc is like straight "Fuck you! pay me" like Jay-Z
Lazy niggas complain
Doc load up the cartridge and start kicking game like Acclaim
Those who you call Doggs'll rat your name
Those who say they love you'll tap your change
That's why I fold down 4 fingers
Say fuck the world and Jimmy da earth out with Coat hangers
Rap game and street game don't sleep
Its a cold world better pack your own heat
Niggas ain't happy to the cash on "E"
Then the hash and the cat and a bag is on me
Yeah Right!! My bear hugs air tight
New Yorkers no no turning on a red light
Me against 40 of you? A fair fight
Microphones get took you shook wear white

You don't got no ends in Mi Casa
(And its your stopper meth tical man and funk docta)
You dont got no wins in Mi Casa
(Bomb Droppa throw you outch ya mind who shot ya)
You dont got no ends in Mi Casa
(Hit it Hip Hoppers turn it up a notch make it it hot cha)
You dont got no wins in Mi Casa
(I'm warnin you partner Meth tidal man and funk docta)
Every time I turn around somebody in my business
Time for you to testify can I get a witness
Actin like bitches
Dirty Dick niggas look suspicious
Ain't physically fit for the fitness
Welcome to the game of death, polly wanna biscuit?
First prize a one way ticket to my shit list
And I spread it like a rumor or a sickness
Stand-by let a chicken head lay a chicklet
Can I slap a fat ass with the quickness?
Stupid ass niggas goin' raw get the syphilis
Coming through son I'mma fuck you and your district
Mis-representing misinterpreting and des misfit
Playboy, you ain't got no balls plus your dickless
And I'm like a plumber laying pipes in your misses
No man can hold hold me nor can control me
Next time you see me holla like you know me!

You don't got no ends in Mi Casa
(And its your stopper meth tical man and funk docta)
You dont got no wins in Mi Casa
(Bomb Droppa throw you outch ya mind who shot ya)
You dont got no ends in Mi Casa
(Hit it Hip Hoppers turn it up a notch make it it hot cha)
You dont got no wins in Mi Casa
(I'm warnin you partner Meth tidal man and funk docta)Embed
