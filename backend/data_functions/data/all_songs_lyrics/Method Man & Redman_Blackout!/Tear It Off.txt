Tear It Off Lyrics
Whooooo! Yo yo yo, yo yo
Huh
Yo, vanglorious!
This is protected by the Red (and Tical!)
Slap it down (Way out of bounds)
Throw in the towels ('Fore we gun down)

Yo, flipmodes, toilet bowls explode
When Doc come drop a shitload
Grip fours, mushrooms, did those (Ah!)
Dee pistol-whip hoes, a bitch owes
Money, bro I stick a zip code (Heh)
Tiptoed, before Doc hit skid row
Thirsty? Sniffing out a pig nose
My Benz built with wings and 6-0s
My flows is North Pole cold
My hands got areas to fit snow
Doc, mixin hoes and discos (Heh)
My dogs, let em walk with ripped clothes (Woof-woof-woof)
Shows, niggas pack six rows
"We're losin him!" His heart won't get pulse
Crack your backs off a ten percent dose
Lip closed? I can hum and ship gold
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Back up, don't make me shoot y'all
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
You don't, want to fuck with us, you don't

I gets down, rip sound, with this stick style
Pist-al, lick round, get off my dick now
Get crabbed, hostile, you kids is docile
Timid, cared to get in it, these dogs is Rockwild
Unchained, untamed, you know my name
Act strange, pack flame, it's not a game
Just ill flows, that kills shows, you can feel, yo
Kickin in you do', like a steel toe, for real, though
Y'all gon' learn, I spit germs (Hock-ptui)
When you come short on Big Worm
You get burned (Tsssss)
Punks don't get turned, they get done, and get sun
Come get some, the last vict-im, lie in a ditch (Haha!)
Now who wanna fuck with Hot Nikk' (what!)
Niggas chew gum with they ass and pop shit
Me and Funk Doc get, toxic (C'mon!)
A bowl of rice and some chopsticks
Donâ€™t make you Wu, just imposters
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Back up, don't make me shoot y'all
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
You don't, want to fuck with us, you don't

Try to O.K. Corral with Doc and Meth Tical
Bar saloon fight, without weapons out (Yeehaw!)
Stretch marks, like belly on Kevin Liles
One yard to score, only second down
Hoes play wifey, wanna settle down
Tryin to lock cash? Bitch better bounce
Boyfriend jump in, Meth shut him down
Pound to echo loud, 'bout seven miles (Bop-bop-bop...)
Doc, Dirty Jersey hunt em down
Uncut, rhymes won't even fit the file
Baddest man out the bunch, pick him out
Drunk with a gun, miss you? Hit the crowd
Snitches, someone kiss to stitch your mouth
Wilder then winos on liquor droughts (Haha!)
Mrs. Howell, Mary-Ann, dig em out
Ginger watch, with the gun in Skipper mouth
Love the ruckus, and love to dish it out (C'mon!)
Pre-washed MCs, start rinsin out
Get your whole camp put on the missin file
Pushin twelve out, bumpin digital (Hah!)
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Back up, don't make me shoot y'all
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
You don't, want to fuck with us, you don't

We Just-Ice, men or mice, ain't nuttin nice
(Fuck your life!) Your type just too light to fight (Uh-huh)
We move right, on Fright Night, when niggas bite (Huh)
We bust pipe, 'pon those that suck tight (C'mon)
We alright, you all hype and all trife
In The Source with half-mic, you half-liked (Uh-huh)
And half-dead, blasted on flatbed
I'm past fed, eyes red, the hash head
Burn something, earn something and learn something
Take my turn fronting, Def Jam ain't heard nothing yet
Suspect, roughnecks, book 'em, Dan-o
You get busted, never leave home without my musket (Bow!)
Trust this, out for justice, clown
And caught on Judgment Day, call Joe Brown (Ha!)
Take MCs to town if they starbound
Ashes to ashes, they all fall down (Down, yeah)
Master you bastards with hazardous tactics (Ah!)
Semi-automatic full rap metal jacket (Yeah)
Blasted in plastic your brain on the mattrress (Ah!)
All you kids is ass-backwards and vice-a versa (C'mon!)

Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
Back up, don't make me shoot y'all
Tear the roof off the mother
Tear the roof off the mother
You don't, want to fuck with us, you don't

Come on, yo tear the roof off
Nigga, yo tear the roof off
Back up, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't, want to fuck with us, you don't

Huh..
Yo, you don't want to fuck with us, you don't
Yo, you don't want to fuck with us, you don't3Embed
