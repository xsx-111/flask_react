1, 2, 1, 2 Lyrics
Come on
1, 2, 1, 2, uh uh
1, 2, 1, 2
Mr. Meth, Funk Doc
1, 2, 1, 2, uh uh
1, 2, 1, 2
DJ Scratch on the track
1, 2, 1, 2
Wa wa 1, 2, 1, 2
Break your mothafuckin' back
1, 2, 1, 2
Ah yo yo

My lyric is AWOL
Batter up, play ball
Fuck y'all analog niggas, we be digital
Subliminal command from the 5-star general
Attack you from the blind side, invisible
To the naked eye
Where them criminals?
Better have your 8 essential vitamins and minerals
When Wu is coming through, you know the outcome (Critical!)
Conditionin' your physical for injurin'
The officer and gentleman who stack private Benjamin
Off a beat like this
I keep a night stick
In case any stick up kid with heat might miss
I chicken fry rice bitch in a white trench
Bustin off two macks, I'm like "I'm hit!"
Yo, I'm just playin'
I clear the crowd out like a pepper spray can sprayin'
I throw lightning out the arms, Raiden
Your guard should pray
Next year I do nothin' more than Y2K
{Hook: Method Man (Redman)}
We say
Wa wa wa wa 1, 2, 1, 2
Wa wa wa wa 1, 2, 1, 2
We say
Wa wa wa wa 1, 2, 1, 2 we say
Wa wa wa wa 1, 2, 1, 2
We say
Wa wa wa wa 1, 2, 1, 2
Wa wa wa wa 1, 2, 1, 2
And if you say fuck me
(I'mma say fuck you)
Wa wa wa wa 1, 2, 1, 2
From debutant down to stripper
I'm too nonchalant
A drink mixed with four kinds of liquors
Catch me at the bar "Fu Bar"
Ladies know who we are and dream of fuckin' a star
Who da scrub?
Shotgun in his man car, burnin' up
Forever gettin' thrown out the club
It be us, Paul
Shot out and bugged
I smoke bud, sniff a bee's ass to get a buzz
I'm everything you think you don't know

Yo Meth
I throw a 5 in the power
Pop a wheelie with the front end hittin' speed bumps, 40 miles per hour
I'm out at Howard, next to Baltimore
Takin' change out the fountains at shopping malls
Rats can only afford Chuck-E-Cheese
The blood in my genes is tough like Buddy Lee
Semi-dart auto off ya, blood coughin'
Meth pull the last spark plug with a heart pump
{Hook}
Call me Will, enemy at state
When Funk Doc run the scam
New jacks stutterin', dudder? man from the upper hand
Punch, atomic bomb'll hit many
From Bricks to South Park, you dyin' with Kenny
While you bailin', I'm trailin'
Rockin' hard hat helmets
Clip the satellite surveillance
When I walk by, you better not be kickin'
Or I'll put two more in that teriyaki chicken

You've just been fitted for them cement shoes
This is bottom of the lake raps
Stab you in the back, Kung Fu
52 cops can't withstand the 52 blocks
Unless they bust like 52 shots
I'm the has-been that have not
Battle kids at Maxwell's house
Know when I'm good to the last drop
What's my name? Meth, his name, Doc
Just like urban
See me in the grand transportation splurgin'
Drivin' with a turban who push a black Suburban (come on)
We rollin' windows half down through the urban
Network, law, lay it down like a Persian
M to the E to the F, spell curtains

Get out your car, sucker
This ain't yours
Robbed you with a gun that's filled with paintballs
And broads got the nerve to act funny
You a champagne ho with Kool-Aid money
Frown bitch, Doc up in that tail quick
You back down a point on NFL Blitz
Iâ€™m liable to break fool and take two
And punch a hole in the earth to escape through
{Hook}

DJ Scratch
Not ready for prime time playas
Mr. Meth, Funk Doc
Def Jam 2000 muthafuckasssssss!!! (echos out)
Hold me down, baby
Nod your head to this
Come on!

Ey yo, this is WKYA radio
We kickin' your mothafuckin' ass
Yo, Flex!

That's right, it's goin' down
Redman, Method Man, blackin' the funk out
Now listen!Embed
