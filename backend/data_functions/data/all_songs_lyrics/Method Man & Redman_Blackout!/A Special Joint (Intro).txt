A Special Joint (Intro) Lyrics
Do you want to get high man?

Does Pinocchio have wooden balls man?

Well yo, I got a joint I've been saving here for a special occasion

Ah, niggas, bitches, welcome
A full tank of gas, a pound of weed, a bird called Pinky
To the east, driver to the east
Funk doctor and the phenom
By the way, this is protected by the red
The track and tical with the key

Oh shit, where the keys at?Embed
