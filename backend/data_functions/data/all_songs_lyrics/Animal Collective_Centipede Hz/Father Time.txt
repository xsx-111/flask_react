Father Time LyricsOpen up your locket
Does solidarity breed from a good foundation?
Things speed out of date now
You can be falling and when you're up it's blown up
With all new buildings painted
They're not your colors
They're all the places you went to
You don't get what they offer but hey that's Nathan
And didn't he pass a long time ago?
Where'd he go, where'd he go now?
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
We exorcised the weekend
Now all the demons can't play but they snuck into Thursday
Looking out for panthers from the road again
But didn't they pass a long time ago?
Where'd they go, where'd they go now?
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?
Luck it's not real or it's real, no it's not real, maybe it's only real
When lightning landed and hit you right where you were standing
Or when your imagination shows you
What only time is supposed to tell you
Then I imagine time
He's got real big hands and bigger plans
From a long time ago
And did I remember suitcase?
And all the things in my head
And all the expectations of doing something special
I could be gone today, but where do they take?
Luck it's not real
Though my feelings say its real
Maybe it's only real when someone blinds you
When they had always been so kind to you
Imagination won't get moldy
Can't wait for time to unfold me
And then I imagine time
He's got real big hands and bigger plans
From a long time ago
There are none too small
There are none too small
There are none too small
There are none too small2Embed
