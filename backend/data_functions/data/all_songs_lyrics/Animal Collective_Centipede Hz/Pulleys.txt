Pulleys LyricsPulleys and vines
The natural cages
Trees said their smarts aren't in the books they wrote
Wooden notes
Pulleys like vines
Like minded people do they
Feel afraid?
Feel afraid?
Pulleys and vines and they use them for all kinds if you
Mind it grows
Mind it grows
Mind it grows
Mind it grows
Pulleys and vines
Why do they want me to move up?
(you go)
Tunnels and caves
The humanoid mazes
Heart said a place to hide is a head
Oppose
Up the nose
Tunnels or caves
Different people can they kiss amazed?
Kiss amazed?
Tunnels and caves are magnificent places to escape you'll go
Escape you'll go
Escape you'll go
Escape you'll go
Tunnels and caves
We're here to help you are you feeling low?
Feeling low
Feeling low
Feeling low
Pulleys and vines
The natural cages
Trees said their smarts aren't in the books they wrote
Wooden notes
