New Town Burnout LyricsWhen I make it
When I make it
When I make it
Back home
Back home
I'll take my shoes off
I'll take my coat off
I'll leave my belongings alone
Alone
No more at the wrong time
No more in the wrong place
No more getting through trials in sight
No more little fights
Never more a broke mess at night
Out of my body, out of my mind
Out of my body, out of my mind
Out of my
Lift this weight, weight, weight
Leave my light, light on, light
Lift this weight, weight, weight
Leave my light, light on, light
Lift this weight, weight, weight
Leave my light, light on, light
Lift this weight, weight, weight
Leave my light, light on, light, light on
Light
Light
