Rosie Oh LyricsAs I walked across the bridge
With a backpack cross my shoulder blades
The Everglades below the wooden cracks
You had offered up a ride
So I might not get accosted by
The watery slide
But I said no, I’d rather not
Said no, I’d rather not
Said no, I’d rather not step in
As I left my home I cried
And a substituted figure tried
To reconcile the things I'd left behind
You had opened up the door
And made a place where I could sit inside
And fortify
But I said no, I’d rather not
Said no, I’d rather not
Said no, I’d rather not step in
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
Now no one's been invested in
How no one knows what's best for him
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
When no one's left to light the load
Then so one goes to lift alone
I'd like to embrace it
Like to embrace it
Like to embrace it all
Have I made this or is it
That I've been made?Embed
