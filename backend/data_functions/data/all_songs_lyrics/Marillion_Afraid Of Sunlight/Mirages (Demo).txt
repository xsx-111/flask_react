Mirages (Demo) LyricsAbsence makes the heart go mad
All the solid things become mirages
The certain things, sand running in the hour glass
Running away I scream along the ledge
As the windows back and close
I run around try to prove the sunrise
I believe in belief but it's proof I need
Can you show me it's me?
Can you show me it's me?
Traveling makes the mind go vague
All the special faces fade away
Spinning like a heat haze shimmering
Please send Polaroids or an ear in the post
A map to the treasure, a key to the closed
I need you like hell, can you help me again?
Can you show me it's me
Can you show me it's me
I run dry, I run out, I run cold, I need help
Trying to prove the sunrise
Trying to prove the tides
Trying to prove the blue moon sky
And is it you? Is it you?Embed
