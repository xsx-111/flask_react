Beautiful LyricsEverybody knows we live in a world
Where they give bad names to beautiful things
Everybody knows we live in a world
Where we don't give beautiful things a second glance
Heaven only knows that we live in a world
Where what we call beautiful is just something on sale
People laughing behind their hands while the fragile
And sensitive are given no chance
And the leaves turn from red to brown
To be trodden down
To be trodden down
And the leaves turn from red to brown
Fall to the ground
Fall to the ground
We don't have to live in a world
Where we give bad names to beautiful things
We should live in a beautiful world
We should give beautiful a second chance
And the leaves fall from red to brown
To be trodden down
To be trodden down
And the leaves turn green to red to brown
Fall to the ground
And get kicked around
You strong enough to be...
Have you the faith to be...
Sane enough to be...
Honest enough to say...
Don't have to be the same
Don't have to be this way
C'mon and sign your name
You wild enough to remain beautiful?
Beautiful
Beautiful
And the leaves turn from red to brown
To be trodden down
Trodden down
And we fall green to red to brown
Fall to the ground
We can turn it around
You strong enough to be...
Why don't you stand up and say?
Give yourself a break
They laugh at you anyway
So why don't you stand up and be
Beautiful
Beautiful
Black, white, red, gold and brown
We're stuck in this world
Nowhere to go
Turning around
 What are you so afraid off?
Show us what you're made of
Be yourself and be beautiful
