Evil Angel Lyrics
Hold it together
Birds of a feather
Nothing but lies and crooked wings
I have the answer
Spreading the cancer
You are the faith inside me

No
Don't
Leave me to die here
Help me survive here
Alone
I don't remember
Remember

Put me to sleep, evil angel
Open your wings, evil angel

I'm a believer
Nothing could be worse
All these imaginary friends
Hiding betrayal
Driving the nail
Hoping to find a savior
No
Don't
Leave me to die here
Help me survive here
Alone
Don't surrender
Surrender

Put me to sleep, evil angel
Open your wings, evil angel

Fly over me, evil angel
Why can't I breathe?
