Unknown Soldier Lyrics

Borderline
Dead inside
I don't mind
Falling to pieces
Count me in
Violent
Let's begin
Feeding the sickness
How do I
Simplify?
Dislocate
The enemy's on the way

Show me what it's like
To dream in black and white
So I can leave this world tonight

Full of fear, Everclear
I'll be here, fighting forever
Curious, venomous
You'll find me climbing to heaven
Never mind, turn back time
You'll be fine, I will get left behind
Show me what it's like
To dream in black and white
So I can leave this world tonight
Holding on too tight
Breathe the breath of life
So I can leave this world behind

(Ooh)
It only hurts just once (Ooh)
They're only broken bones (Ooh)
Hide the hate inside (Ooh)
(Oh)
(So I can leave this world behind)

Show me what it's like
To dream in black and white
So I can leave this world tonight
Holding on too tight
Breathe the breath of life
So I can leave this world behind4Embed
