You Lyrics
My hands are broken and time is going on and on
It goes forever (how long?)
So, I got high and lived all that life
I have taken all for granted

Promise me you'll try to leave it all behind
'Cause I've elected hell
Lying to myself
Why have I gone blind?
Live another life
You

The only way out is letting your guard down
And never die forgotten (I know)
And forgive me, my love
I stand here all alone and I can see the bottom

Promise me you'll try to leave it all behind
'Cause I've elected hell
Lying to myself
Why have I gone blind?
Live another life
You
