The Diary of Jane (Acoustic) Lyrics
If I had to I would put myself right beside you
So let me ask would you like that? Would you like that?
And I don't mind if you say this love is the last time
So now I'll ask do you like that? Do you like that?

Something's getting in the way, something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

Try to find out, what makes you tick as I lie down
Sore and sick, do you like that? Do you like that?
And I don't mind, if you say this love is the last time
Just let me say that I like that, I like that!

Something's getting in the way, something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page, as I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

Desperate I will crawl, waiting for so long
No love, there is no love
Die for anyone, what have I become?
Something's getting in the way, something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page, as I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of JaneEmbed
