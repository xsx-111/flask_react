Dance With The Devil Lyrics
Here I stand
Helpless and left for dead

Close your eyes
So many days go by
Easy to find what's wrong
Harder to find what's right

I believe in you
I can show you that
I can see right through
All your empty lies
I won't stay long
In this world so wrong

Say goodbye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the Devil tonight

Trembling
Crawling across my skin
Feeling your cold, dead eyes
Stealing the life of mine
I believe in you
I can show you that
I can see right through
All your empty lies
I won't last long
In this world so wrong

Say goodbye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Hold on
Hold on (Oh)


Say goodbye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Hold on
Hold on
(Ooh)
