No Right Thing Lyrics
You won't hear my name I can't watch you throw it all away (away)
You are playing games, I'm done trying to help you run down, escape (escape)

But you look away, and I look to you
That's where we are, and what we saw was you
On your own, and I'm on my own
And we were wrong, there's no right thing

I've been you've been my everything
And i've seen your worst baby
This is what it comes to
Knowing we're broken
I've been changing my whole scene
You need somebody different
This is where we got to
Knowing that you're the wrong thing

But you look away, and I look to you
That's where we are, and what we saw was you
On your own, and I'm on my own
And we were wrong, there's no right thing
But you can't see me, when you're pushing me away
You can't see me, when you're pushing me away
I'm the one who sees you, I'm the one who needs you
You can't see me, when you're pushing me away
You can't see me, when you're pushing me away
I'm the one who sees you, I'm the one who needs you

But you look away, and I look to you
That's where we are, and what we saw was you
On your own, and I'm on my own
And we were wrong, there's no right thing2Embed
