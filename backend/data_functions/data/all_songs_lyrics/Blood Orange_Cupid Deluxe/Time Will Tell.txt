Time Will Tell Lyrics
No, you should do it

Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've kept your eye on
It is what it is
Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've kept your eye on
It is what it is
(And it keeps on running back)

Finishing 8 or 9 tell me its the perfect time
Oh, oh
(And it keeps on running back)
Told you I'll be waiting hiding from the rainfall
Yeah, eah
(And it keeps on running back)

Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
(And it keeps on running back)
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
(And it keeps on running back)
(And it keeps on running)

Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've kept your eye on
It is what it is
(And it keeps on running back)
Even if it's all you know just keep your heart in
Anyway to keep it up just never let yourself down
(And it keeps on running back)
Even if it's something that you've kept your eye on
It is what it is
(And it keeps on running back)
Oh, oh
(And it keeps on running back)
(And it keeps on running back)
Finishing 8 or 9 tell me its the perfect time
Oh, oh
(And it keeps on running back)
(I've kept it open, and wanted nobody to be my friend)
Told you I'll be waiting hiding from the rainfall
Yeah, yeah
(I've wasted moments in the Bowery light, and lost it all)

Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
(I've kept it open)
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Yeah, eah

(And it keeps on running back)
(And it keeps on running back)
(And it keeps on running back)
Time will tell
(And it keeps on running back)
Time will tell
Time will tell
(It keeps on running back)
Time will tell
(And it keeps on running back)
Time will tell
Time will tell
(It keeps on running back)
(And it keeps on running)8Embed
