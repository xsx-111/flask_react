Always Let U Down Lyrics
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always

I traveled from Dublin
You said you'd change the world
You sing like Sinatra, always
You pulled them for miles now, like Garbo in Berlin
You played them for zeroes, just like always
Tonight some bitch is hassling me
And tonight it feels so good feeling cheap
I can only disappoint you

You turned a man cuckoo
Half animal half grace
The chick was a teaser, always
Tonight their hips will swivel and turn
So we drove to the place where we first met

I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always7Embed
