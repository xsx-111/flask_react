On The Line Lyrics
Tell me if you caught my lie
My heart's not true
Tell me if we're on the line
Are we there, oh?
Tell me if you're in my life
Don't go, baby, are we on the line
Are we through?

Baby, are we on the line
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Is our love on the line?
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Look and tell me what I'd find
Tell me, baby, are you mine?

Tell me if you caught my lie
My heart's not true
Tell me if we're on the line
Are we there, oh?
Tell me if you're in my life
Don't go, baby, are we on the line
Are we through?
Baby, are we on the line
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Is our love on the line?
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Look and tell me what I'd find
Tell me, baby, are you mine?

So baby, is it all you got?

Baby, are we on the line
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Is our love on the line?
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Look and tell me what I'd find
Tell me, baby, are you mine?5Embed
