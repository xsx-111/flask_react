Chosen Lyrics
It was the last weekend of September
I stayed up all night long
Waiting for the fire ache in my heart to subside
It never happened
He was the most beautiful boy I'd ever seen
Most beautiful boy I'd ever met
My favorite books
Around the clock scars of my knee
I see him behind my lids in a bright grey shirt
I see him tripping running and falling, covered in dirt
I see a lot of these things lately I know
I know none of it is real

It's in the way that he moves but I don't want to choose

Another day and I'll lose, but i don't want to choose

Face to the ground, change the sound
Time in your mind, make it right

It's in the way that he moves but I don't want to choose
Another day and I'll lose, but i don't want to choose

Baby, let me take you home6Embed
