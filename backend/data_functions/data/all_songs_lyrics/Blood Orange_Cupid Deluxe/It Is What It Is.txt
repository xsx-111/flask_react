It Is What It Is Lyrics
I've kept it open
And wanted nobody to be my friend
I've wasted moments in the Bowery light
And lost it all
So, are you smoking?
Don't tell me, baby, you can't work this out
I've wasted moments in the Soho nights
And lost it all

Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've had your eye on
It is what it is

On your own worries
I'm nothing even when I'm with my friends
But you make me think that I'm alive
When I'm alone

Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've had your eye on
It is what it is (And it keeps on running back)
Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've had your eye on
It is what it is
Why wasn't it real?
Why wasn't it real?

Talk me through the stages before I go home
Why wasn't it real?
Roxy got me twitching and I'm home alone
Taking it for granted that you're here with me
Just tell me the truth
Am I just a lonely fabled obsessive?
That ain't got no clue5Embed
