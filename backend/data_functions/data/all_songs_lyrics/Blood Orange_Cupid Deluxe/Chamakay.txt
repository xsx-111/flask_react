Chamakay Lyrics
If giving left me lonely
If giving was my friend
I'm keeping all the old themes
I'm keeping my loose ends
But now you're feeling empty
I tried my best last time
I'll leave you with your feelings
I'll leave you in your lies

I'm nothing without subtle
Heartache at its best
Are you the one who breaks my
Heart out of my chest

I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you waiting for a guy/girl like me to come along
Come along, to come along
Baby girl you're wrong
I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you waiting for a guy/girl like me to come along
To come along, to come along, to come along
Baby girl you're wrong
If giving left me lonely
If giving was my friend
(Giving was my friend)
I'm keeping all the old themes
(Keeping all the old themes)
I'm keeping my loose ends
(My loose ends)
But now you're feeling empty
(Now you're feeling empty)
I tried my best last time
(Tried my best this time)
I'll leave you with your feelings
(I'll leave you in your lies)
I'll leave you in your lies

I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you waiting for a guy/girl like me to come along
Come along, to come along
Baby girl you're wrong
I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you waiting for a guy/girl like me to come along
To come along, to come along, to come along
Baby girl you're wrong11Embed
