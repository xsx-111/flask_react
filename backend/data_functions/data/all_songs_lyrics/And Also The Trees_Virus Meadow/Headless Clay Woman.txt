Headless Clay Woman LyricsUnder amillion scattered stars
From rippled earth that's cracked and sleeping
Under the frozen static stars
The headless clay woman's
Shimmering body stands
And the frost that locks her nakedness
Melts away
Through air that's crystal black ink shadows
As sharp as the thickest thorn and the ice
She moves painless, slow and flowing
Across the wild and trembling path
And the headless clay woman's
Motionless beauty shines
Restless stars reflect in wet red streams
Across her back
Her bare feet step over the split stones
Past the water pump and the pail
Round and round the paint flaking empty house
And past the glass warped window
And the headless clay woman
She stands half up and half down the stairs
She cannot see the bottom
And she cannot see the top
A million stars are shining
A million stars...
As she lies back down
In the frozen warped worldEmbed
