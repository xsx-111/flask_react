Slow Pulse Boy LyricsSomewhere the blast furnace explodes
Plumes of amber in the night sky
Each explosion bounces
From horizon to horizon
From horizon... to horizon
And for a while, the slow pulse boy
Stood by the window
And let the fire sink into his skin
Again all was still
But for the empty tin
Rolling up and down a gutter
On the breeze
Then we were standing very close
I could live in the space
Between his heartbeats
Outside the blast furnace errupts again
And dark red rivers
Filled our veins with frenzy
We could tear up the floors
And find all the things we'd ever lost
And the fire burns in our jack boots
So we chase the explosions
From horizon to horizon
Wrap ourselves around the distance
For as long as we can hold
Somewhere a girl is singing
There is calm in the air
But there is greater calm than I can bear
Tomorrow the sun shines1Embed
