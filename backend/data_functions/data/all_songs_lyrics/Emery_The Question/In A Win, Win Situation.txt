In A Win, Win Situation Lyrics
I've noticed your design
‘cause I'm not blind
I'm like a cigarette
Burning, burning every night
But there's no ash that falls
There's only telephone calls
In the afternoon
Stretching through a thousand walls

So I'll pray
For words to say
To make these miles disappear
If you can't sleep alone
I'm better off, I'm better off
If you can't sleep alone

If we're measuring with time
In seconds or in lifetimes, there's no difference
It's constantly just passing by
But there's nothing at all
Not Valium or slow songs to
Relax my view, just you
Maybe your new perfume
So I'll pray
For words to say
To make these miles disappear
If you can't sleep alone
I'm better off, I'm better off
If you can't hear the song
Then turn it off, then turn it off
If you cast the first stone
Then throw them all
Then throw them all

I start to sleep, but it's not over
The second hand is moving slower now
I'd take it all back to start over again
Just between the rock and paper
The scissors cut in so much deeper
I'd take it all back
To start over again
Again, again, again

And I'll stay here
You’ll be gone for another year
The plans that I’ve made
Have fallen on deaf ears
And I’m beside myself now that you have gone
I’m beside myself now that you have goneEmbed
