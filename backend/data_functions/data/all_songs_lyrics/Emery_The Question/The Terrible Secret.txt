The Terrible Secret Lyrics
Pave these streets with open arms
It's always you we have waited on
The skin, the taste, the drug, the need
I am asking, telling you, don't leave
Erase the lines that we have drawn
It's always you we have waited on and waited on and on and on

These are our words that fill these mouths
But all the letters of the alphabet could never spell it out
These palms and frames that we tear through
To cling to something that is bigger than the failed attempts at you

Wait, wait, wait
I don't want to see
Wait, wait, wait
I am not the person anyone would want to be

The perfect shoes with the matching clothes
It is the lie we are always told
But nothing masks the shallow touch
Like saying words that cost so much
While you are an addict to the need
To find yourself a way to breathe
The sex, the purge, the vein, the look
To replace the feelings that we have took
These are our words that fill these mouths
But all the letters of the alphabet could never spell it out
These palms and frames that we tear through
To cling to something that is bigger than the failed attempts at you

Perfection
It's perfection
But never quite enough and never could disguise
The drugs to make it stay
The wanting in your eyes
The money that you spent
But you are still an accident

We are more than words that fill our mouths
Drink with eyes that tell us the answers that we need

These are our words that fill these mouths
But all the letters of the alphabet could never spell it out
These palms and frames that we tear through
To cling to something that is bigger than the failed attempts at you

Wait, wait, wait
I don't want to see
Wait, wait, wait
I am not the person anyone would want to be
Waiting here 'til you leaveEmbed
