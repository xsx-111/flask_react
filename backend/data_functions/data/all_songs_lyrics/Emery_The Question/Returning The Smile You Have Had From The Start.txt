Returning The Smile You Have Had From The Start Lyrics
You wanted to know if
If it was worth the pain that it has caused us
Both our lives - subtract one life
To know why it was you deserved this

As simple as I can
I'll tell you the difference
Between a pencil and a pen
And where it will leave us now
As your body lets you die
And I sit here still alive

In my memory I wrote you down in ink
I never wanted to erase your story
Even with the tragedy it brings

The fluid in your lungs
That tells you you're losing, stop breathing
The medicine that comes will fix you
Will help you but takes you from conscious to sleep
Place my hands to face and weep
In my memory I wrote you down in ink
I never wanted to erase your story
Even with the tragedy it brings

Something beautiful
Something torn from my hands
I'm not ready for you to die
(I can't leave here like this, get away from her)
This day will end with a life complete
(Get away from her, from her now)
(That's not all, that's not all, that she was
I don't want to say goodbye yet)
This day will end with a life complete
(  this day will end this day)
My closest friend here in front of me
(Will end this day will end this...)

You wanted to know if
If it was worth the pain that it has caused us
Both our lives - subtract one life
To know why it was you deserved thisEmbed
