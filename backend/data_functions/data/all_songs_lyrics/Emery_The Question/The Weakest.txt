The Weakest Lyrics
Point the gun (in your way)
Just pretend that it is time (it is time)
Say the word and I will fire
Sometimes I get so tired of their lies (it never stops)
It's worth more than my life (than my life)
Say the word and I will die

There's no peaceful passing of this new sickness
That I have introduced
To everyone around me
Saying that I'm the cause of all their crime
And when they're drunk I pour the wine

Let's leave this place and say that we escaped
We'll say that there's no difference between right and wrong tonight
We'll leave no trace of plans that we have made
So they can't find us and take what is ours

Point the gun (in your way)
Just pretend that it is time (it is time)
Say the word and I will fire
Take me far from this less-than perfect design
My contributions only go so far
Without monetary gain for my part

Let's leave this place and say that we escaped
We'll say that there's no difference between right and wrong tonight
We'll leave no trace of plans that we have made
So they can't find us and take what is ours

Running with the scissors
Pointed at your heart from your hand
Is that your plan?
I don't have time for questions concerning your future position

Let's leave this place (it won't happen this time)
And say that we escaped (decisions that are mine)
We'll say that there's no difference between right and wrong tonight
We'll leave no trace (the finger and the gun)
Of plans that we have made (to be the only one)
So they can't find us and take what is ours (take what is ours)

Put on your coat (it's time to go)
Dancing very close (with what I want)
Taking every inch to (it's farthest point)
Losing precious time (is not a choice)
When I'm dealing with you (I heard your voice)
Giving up the fight (with arms that bruise)
Delicately shading (these grays and blues)
But I could never stop (bleeding for you)
Endless dedication (my gift to you)Embed
