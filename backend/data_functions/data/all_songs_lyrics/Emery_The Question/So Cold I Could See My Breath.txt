So Cold I Could See My Breath Lyrics
Let's start with just the basics then
I'm sure that we could fake it when
It's time to say how much it meant
And we walk out so innocent

You can be so persuasive
When you say it's
More than a day trip
And convince me
I'm condescending
When I ask, "Will this be ending?"
How quickly lust can pretend that it's love

We're just the boys and girls that think they always know
With answers for the world
The ambiguity shows
We're just the boys and girls that dance with all their clothes
(We are the boys and the girls)
Hiding under the sheets
Believing nobody knows

All the suspense
That we've created
Now it's wasted
And we can't change it
The beginning to the ending
I find myself remembering
How quickly lust can pretend it's love
Designing words to help us believe
It's so much more than just tonight
So we have got to get this right
How quickly words can become our hands
(You want it more, you want it more)
Resigning everything we believe (you want it more, you want it...)
You want it, you want it
More

We're just the boys and girls that think they always know
(we are the boys and the girls)
With answers for the world
The ambiguity shows
We're just the boys and girls that dance with all their clothes
(we are the boys and the girls)
Hiding under the sheets
Believing nobody knows

You could be the one to stay
Made from earth for just this day
But something tells me it's not right
That we could lose it all tonight
I'm no better on my own
Leave the message on your phone
Always trying what I can to be a child and not a man
We're just the boys and girls that think they always know
(We are the boys and the girls)
With answers for the world
The ambiguity shows
We're just the boys and girls that dance with all their clothes
(We are the boys and the girls)
Hiding under the sheets
Believing nobody knows

My hands across your clothes (my hands across your clothes)
And me with all the plans
(Something I'll be)
To keep us boys and girls (to keep us boys and girls)
Another woman and man
(So that I won't always lose)Embed
