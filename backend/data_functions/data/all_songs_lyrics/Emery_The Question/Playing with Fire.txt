Playing with Fire Lyrics
Pardon me for saying so, but you look more pitiful
Than I had ever imagined
Despite perfect fashion
And your photographs depict you so differently
I always thought you would be some sort of match for me

So let's decide who can survive
Stomping feet and racing beats of hearts that don't ever slow
Then I'll write letters on white paper
Expressing my deep disappointment

Dripping where I stand from my watery hands
Hoping to get past the open bedroom door
Where her clothes on the floor remind me of our conversations
The feeling of slight hesitation to turn out the lights

14 days now since we started (I'm not)
To complicate the situation (I'm not hiding from this situation)
I'm not hiding (I'm not)
I'm just buying some time for us to find the back door
(I'm not hiding from this situation)
We will come out when it's safe for us
When it's safe for us
When it's safe for us, us
For us all
There's nothing left to say (Don't believe me when I say it's over.)
To excuse the way that I've behaved
I still feel him
Gripping like a stain to this fabric
(By the time you're gone it's all uncovered)
Torn in every seam, then thrown away

One without regret, I will not forget
One without regret, I will not forget

Why should I take all the blame for my mistakes?
(One without regret)
You were there with every promise made to break
(I will not forget)
When did you become the one without regret?
(One without regret)
Kill me, burn me down, I swear I won't forget
(I will not forget)
When did you become the one without regret?
(Kill me, kill me, kill me)
Kill me, burn me down, I swear I won't forget
(Kill me, kill me)Embed
