In A Lose, Lose Situation Lyrics
Don't be late
There's no time to be afraid
There's a way
To clean up the mess you've made

If I could tell the truth
Or lie would I
Attempt the two at the same time
Expect you to apologize for trying
To make me so uptight
Don't say it's just a game
We play
I can't lose the taste

If you regulate how the blood is pumping
Through the veins
From my heart into my head
(In time this blood supply
Will change me from red to white)
Every thought that you know I'm thinking
May as well be the knife stuck in my back
This taxing fever makes me gravitate
To this place
(This is still my life
Not yours to defy)
Anyone in their right mind would never let you inside
Anyone in their right mind
I've broken ties with the neighborhood
I'm feeling like a bum in the city
Waiting only to take a drink
From an empty glass
Of nothing good
Sinking like a stone in the sea
Without the oxygen I need

Deciding as I wait for it to entertain
Careful not to breathe in, to breathe in, to breathe in
The right time and the right way to elevate
Careful not to breathe in, to breathe in, to breathe in
To breathe in the air
That so proudly puts to death
My own fathers name

I remember when your hands started shaking
There's a better way
To clean out the mess you've been makingEmbed
