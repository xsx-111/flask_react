Studying Politics Lyrics
It's like a pencil with erasers at both ends
I want it all but we're dealing in percents
And these activities that you have engaged in
This is the politics of seeing you dance with him
We began with concluding remarks
Break up the pieces and examine the parts
Your words always cut when they're clich√©
But here's my knife because I came for the buffet

This is the way it goes
With you a part of it
Nervously saying words
That oh so tightly fit
A mark beneath the chin
I've caught you once again
It's in the way you sell every word and phrase
And leaving me to know how much the meaning weighs
Saying that but meaning this
Using hands for emphasis

You'd like to think that you're the best
Part of me but I confess
There is nothing left of you here
These parallels and silly games
Hide your face and say the name
Say the name
This is the way it goes
With you a part of it
Nervously saying words
That oh so tightly fit
A mark beneath the chin
And I've caught you once again
It's in the way you sell every word and phrase
And leaving me to know how much the meaning weighs
Saying that but meaning this
Your tears for emphasis

There's that smile again
You fake it and I follow you right in
What a fool I've been
To fall for it each time

This is the way it goes
With you a part of it
Nervously saying words
That oh so tightly fit
It's in the way you sell every word and phrase
And leaving me to know how much the meaning weighs
This is the way it goes
With you a part of it
Nervously saying words
That oh so tightly fit
It's in the way you sell every word and phrase
(This is the way it goes)
And leaving me to know how much the meaning weighs
(With you a-part of it)
Black Dress and your eyes are telling white white lies
White white lies
Black Dress and your eyes are telling white white lies
White white liesEmbed
