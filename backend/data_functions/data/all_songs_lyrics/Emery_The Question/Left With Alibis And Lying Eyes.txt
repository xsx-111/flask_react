Left With Alibis And Lying Eyes Lyrics
Watching someone stop breathing
Feel their arms and palms releasing
The color, the smell of their skin, all of this with your fingerprints
And there isn't a thing that we can do

Drive, drive, drive, drive, I don't want to get caught
We'll say, we'll say we're innocent
There is enough to prove we're not
They will believe anything
I'm packing all my clothes and never going to go home again
There isn't one thing we've forgot
You'll see, we'll get away with this

My jeans, your shoes, we'll throw away everything we've used
But there's still your worried mouth to match your worried eyes
The only two things left to find

Drive, drive, drive, drive, I don't want to get caught
We'll say, we'll say we're innocent
There is enough to prove we are not
They will believe anything
I'm packing all my clothes and never going to go home again
There isn't one thing we've forgot
You'll see, we'll get away with this
There's no compromise so remember this
Your hands are lies
It is too late for ifs
(Murderer, with your teenage eyes, resist confession)
We'll go home and close the doors and pull the sheets up to our heads and sleep
(Oh, the weight is so much; my heart is hollow with this foolish thing I've done)
And there isn't a thing they can do

Drive, drive, drive, drive, I don't want to get caught
We'll say, we'll say we're innocent
There is enough to prove we are not
They will believe anything
I am packing all my clothes and never going to go home again
There isn't one thing we've forgot
You'll see, we'll get away with thisEmbed
