Oceanic Feeling Lyrics
It's a blue day
We could jump Bulli
When I hit that water
When it holds me
I think about my father
Doin' the same thing
When he was a boy
When he was a boy
It's a blue day
We could go fishing
You'll catch the big one
Ah

Slidin' the knife under the skin
Grateful for this offering
And all the livin' things under the sun
Under the sun

Little brother, I think you're an angel
I see your silver chain levitate
When you're kickflipping
Baby boy, you're super cool
I know you're scared, so was I
But all will be revealed in time (Time, time)
Oh, look, the rays are in the bay now
Can you hear the waves and the cicadas all around?
I can make anything real
Brain so hot, it's a summer body
Every day is blue and never cloudy
Don't look down
I can make anything real

In the future
If I have a daughter
Will she have my waist
Or my widow's peak?
My dreamer's disposition or my wicked streak?

Will she split a tab with her lover?
And laugh at the stars like her mother
When she was a girl?
When she was a girl?

Now the cherry-black lipstick's gathering dust in a drawer
I don't need her anymore
'Cause I got this power
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)
And tune in (Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in)
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)
And tune in (Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in)
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe
Oh, was enlightenment found?
No, but I'm tryin', takin' it one year at a time
Oh, oh, can you hear the sound?
It's shimmerin' higher
On the beach, I'm buildin' a pyre
(Use the wood brought in by the tide)
I know you'll show me how, I'll know when it's time
To take off my robes and step into the choir13Embed
