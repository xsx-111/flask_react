Dominoes Lyrics
I heard that you were doing yoga
With Uma Thurman's mother
Just outside of Woodstock
Now you're watering all the flowers
You planted with your new girlfriend
Outside on the rooftop

Just another phase you're rushing on through
Go all New Age, outrunning your blues

Fifty gleaming chances in a row
Then I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again

I know
Know a girl who knows a
Another girl who knows the woman that you hurt
It's strange to see you smoking marijuana
You used to do the most cocaine
Of anyone I'd ever met

Just another phase you're shooting on through
The whole world changеs right around you
You get fifty gleaming chances in a row
And I watch you flick thеm down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again (Don't get up)
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again12Embed
