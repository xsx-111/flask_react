Leader of a New Regime Lyrics
Wearing SPF 3000 for the ultraviolet rays
Made it to the island on the last of the outbound planes (Ah-ah)
Got a trunk full of Simone and CÃ©line, and of course, my magazines
I'm gonna live out my days

Won't somebody, anybody, be the leader of a new regime?
Free the keepers of the burnt-out scene another day
Lust and paranoia reign supreme
We need the leader of a new regime11Embed
