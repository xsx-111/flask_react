Night Lyrics
Here I am, driving through Japan at night
Here I am, pretending everything's alright
And I've got so far to go before the morn
And I can't believe how much it hurts at home
Here I am, living life inside a comic book
Here I am, bored with everything

And I can't believe that I'm here to stay
'Cause I never worked it out this way
And I love you more than I can say
But I hate you every other way

Rain, falling down
Rain, falling down
Rain, falling down
Rain falling down over me

I think I'm closer now
I think I'm closer now
It's getting closer now
Under the light of the moon

I think I'm closer now
I think I'm closer now
It's getting closer now
Under the light of the moon

And I can't believe that I'm here to stay
'Cause I never worked it out this way
And I love you more than I can say
But I hate you every other...
And I'll keep my world from falling apart
In the corner of an aching heart
So say you'll come into the city
Come back with me please

Rain, falling down
Rain, falling down
Rain, falling down
Rain, falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling downEmbed
