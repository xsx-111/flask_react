Thing Beyond Things (bonustrack) LyricsOnce when I was young, I used to dream for hours and hours
I'd dream a world that wasn't small
And I'd travel to a valley where under trees and earth
I'd set my girl
And I knelt down by her head
And lay roses in her hair and I kissed her gently...
So this is what you are
As the sun sets in my eyes I know
I know I know I know I know I know I know  I know I know
And I know this one's the light
And the warm inside of me
Is the oldest wound that I've nursed along
...So don't try to get inside
These things inside are wrong, things beyond things
It's sick now
It's rotten to the core, its eyes bulge and gaze at me...
...Lovingly...
And I remember this smell from my dreams except it was sweeter then...
And even in this room, where I used to lock my secrets
It's starting to smell just like my friend
And I told you not to breathe, so now I sit and watch the rain, I know
I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know
And I know this one's the dark
And the warm inside of me, is the oldest fear that
I've nursed along...
So don't try to get inside
These things inside are all just thingsEmbed
