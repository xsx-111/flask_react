Hide Nowhere Lyrics
Cold blue waves
Cold dead sky
See in the sea what I need to be
Cold blue waves
Cold blue mind... (hear them talk about)
Cold dead mind
See in the sea what is and what will be
Every dream I have wants me to stay
Every night I try to find a way
I hide nowhere
They hide in my world
I have nowhere to go
Dreams come as they...
Sleep comes as it...
Dreams come as they doEmbed
