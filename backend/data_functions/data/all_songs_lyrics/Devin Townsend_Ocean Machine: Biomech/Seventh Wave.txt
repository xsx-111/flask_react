Seventh Wave Lyrics
O Earth, what changes hast thou seen?
There where the long street roars, hath been
The stillness of the central sea
The hills are shadows, and they flow
From form to form, and nothing stands
Like clouds they shape themselves and go
Running away, running away
Running away forever
It was her only chance of finding home
Running away, running away
Running away together...
With only thoughts of finding home
I'll wait for the ocean to rise up
And meet me as it rose up before
(I'll know the time)
I'll wait for the ocean to rise up
And greet me as it rose up before
(I'll know the year)
Because you're never alone
...Even when you're alone
You're never alone...
Watch the seventh wave
Running away, running away
Running into the weather
With only thoughts of finding home
Running away, running away
Running away forever
I realize I'm on my own
On my way pass it on
On my way pass it on
I'll wait for the ocean to rise up
And meet me as it rose up before
(I'll know the time)
I'll wait for the ocean to rise up
And greet me as it rose up before
(I'll know the year)
We're never alone
Even when you're alone
We're never alone... watch the oceanEmbed
