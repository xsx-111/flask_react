Voices in the Fan LyricsWho's the weakest now?
Caught up in the wire
I'm already gone
Who's the weakest now?
It's the grey days that
I'll remember the most
It's the grey times in the water
Before morning
I won't be alone
Think of me at night
Send my love to home
I'll be alright
It's the grey days that
I'll remember the most
It's the grey times in the water
Before morning
And it's only tonight that
I'll be able to leave
And it's only the weak
That cry for me in morning
Because tonight there will be no sleep
Tonight it comes for me
Please, help them understand
I've become the voices in the fan
