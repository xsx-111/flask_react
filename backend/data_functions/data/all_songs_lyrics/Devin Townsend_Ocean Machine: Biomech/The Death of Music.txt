The Death of Music LyricsQuestion
Leapt like dog from man
Terminate high thinking
Known in your prophecy
Sun
Son
Sun it shifts, and brittleness subsides
To sleep
Sleep away
One comes, the rain will always be
And things I am
Are things that should not be
They laughed at me but we never bothered
My friends and I
There were no others
Now it comes
Bolt across the blue
Shadows dance over the land
Walls high, water deep
Brick and steel gathering speed
Guess it's just a feeling
Guess it's just a feeling
Rain may come
The rain may never be
In things you are
Are things I need to be
My friends were there but they never bothered
Now there's you and I and
There are no others
It's like when death becomes musical
It's musical
It's like a death becomes musical
Musical
And it comes...
To make sure that he will never rise
And the groans from the bellies
Have never cried this hard
And the eyes of the wicked ones
Have never been full of dust
In the middle of the sea it waits...
Closer
Home, nor anywhere on Earth on that final day will anyone be apart
One
Schooled
Together
Towards the sea
And we may drown, fly, fall from faith
But the pain won't be realized
Because the emotions will hit as god should
And the mountains will offer no shelter
And the clouds will be no cover
No matter where we run
Don't die on me
Don't go away
When I need you here
In my need
The rain will come
The rain will always be
In things I am
Are things that have to be
My friends have come and I never bothered
Myself and I
There is no other
It's like a death becomes musical
It's musicalEmbed
