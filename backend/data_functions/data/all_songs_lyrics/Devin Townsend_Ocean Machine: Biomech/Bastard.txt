Bastard LyricsNot one of the better days
Nighttime, turn around
Lonely is the city tonight
Nighttime, all around
Lonely in the city tonight
Grey people stare at a static sky (as you will)
Ours is not to question why
Same thing, every time
It always seems to need what I'm not
To all the hopeful ones:
Nobody gives a f*ck what you've got
I only wish that I could pray to god
(but you will)
Stay longer
Please don't leave me alone
Bastard, mother, father, no...
Time passed quicker than you will ever know
And they can push me harder
But you know I'll never go
And they will justify it, but you know
It will take them slow
The girl from blue city
The lights from across the harbour
And the boys are out on the corners
Sex in the neon basements (red and smelly)
And don't feel a thing (it's too cold to worry)
So in the corner by the dock
Where there's no light
It smells like piss but no one knows
And right now just to sleep would be alright
...Feel old, gone where the feelings go
...Gone now in a field of green
Gone where feelings go...Embed
