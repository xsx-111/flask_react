Life Lyrics
"In the exuberance of life there's an awareness that one day we will have to look death in the eye."
My life is all that I've known
And it's all that keeps me here
My time is all that I own
So I won't let it slip away...

How long can this life go on
Who we are what we are...
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
Wouldn't you rather live it on your own
Even when it bends you over
So when it comes time to go home
You don't let them fade away
Away...

How long can this all go on?
How long till it's over?
And how long till it all comes down?
...And how bad do we need a new reminder?

I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
"In death, not only are the mightiest and most humble brought down to the same level, but we're no different from any other organism."1Embed
