Think Locally, Fuck Globally LyricsHey, chavorale, think locally
Hey, palo mande, fuck globally
I come to New York to start a gypsy punk revolt
Now that it's rockin' so why don't I just go home?
Hey, chavorale, think locally
Hey, palo mande, fuck globally
Think locally
Fuck globally
I can't believe back home they failed to understand
That I am simply a chavo kind of man
Hey, chavorale, think locally
Hey, palo mande, fuck globally
Think locally
Fuck globally
And if the country we invented will fall from grace
I guess we'll have to fly away in our own space
Hey, chavorale, think locally
Hey, palo mande, fuck globally
Think locally
Fuck globally
