I Would Never Wanna Be Young Again LyricsBy the desperate and confused
Emotion of the youth
I was brought to crisis island
Where after getting checked for fleas
And barricades of embassies
I was sculpted to be overworked and silent
But since the early age
I broke out of that cage
And learned how to make marching drums from fish can
And I knew I'll run away
And so without further delay
I said, "Two tears in a bucket, motherfuck it"
And it seems like I ran and ran
Through the garbage and quicksand
And after getting checked for fleas
And barricades of embassies
I would never never never
Wanna be young again
So
But sudden wind it stole my hat
And I went on chasing it
Before I was just another burned out carnie
Every freak on every day
Lives a life one certain way
And that way is ain't no nothin' but a birthright
But since the early age
I broke out of the cage
And learned how to make marching drums from fish can
And I knew I'll run away
And so without further delay
I said, "Two tears in a bucket, motherfuck it"
And it seems like I ran and ran
Through the garbage and quicksand
And after getting checked for fleas
And barricades of embassies
I would never never never
Wanna be young again
What?
And it seems like I ran and ran
Through the garbage and quicksand
And after getting checked for fleas
And barricades of embassies
I would never never never
Wanna be young againEmbed
