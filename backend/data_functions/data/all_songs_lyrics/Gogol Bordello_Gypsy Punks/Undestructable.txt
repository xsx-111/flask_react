Undestructable LyricsWhen I was younger I lived in fear
That incarceration of some kind is near
I checked my head, in tact with rules
I nearly became a goddamn fool
But I've heard voices not in the head
Out in the air they called ahead
Through ripped out speakers
Through thick and thin
They found a shelter
Under my skin
How many darkest moments and traps
Still lay ahead of us?
Undestructable
How many final frontiers we gonna mount
With maybe no victory laps?
Undestructable
But if you stepped on path of sacred art
And stuck it out through thick and thin
God knows you become one
With undestructable
And so no longer live I in fear
Them are too greedy to pay my asylum bills
This is my life and freedom's my profession
This is my mission throughout all flight duration
There is a core and it's hardcore
All is hardcore when made with love
The love is a voice of a savage soul
This savage love is undestructable
How many darkest moments and traps
Still lay ahead of us?
Undestructable
How many final frontiers we gonna mount
With maybe no victory laps?
Undestructable
But if you stepped on path of sacred art
And stuck it out through thick and thin
God knows you become one
With undestructable
Undestructable!
How many...
Undestructable
How many final frontiers
With maybe no victory laps?
Undestructable
But if you stand on path of sacred art
And stuck it out through thick and thin
God knows you become one
With undestructable
Ох сколько мгновений чёрных
Невозможных
Нам всем предстоит преодолеть
Ох сколько пиров победных впереди
Но всё равно нам не успеть
Но если, если сокровенный путь один -
Ты будешь несокрушим
Несокрушим!
