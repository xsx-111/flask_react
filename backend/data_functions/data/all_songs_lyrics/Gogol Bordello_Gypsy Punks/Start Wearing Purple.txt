Start Wearing Purple Lyrics
I wanna tell everybody a true story

Start wearing purple, wearing purple
Start wearing purple for me now
All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish
I promise, it's just a matter of time
So yeah, ha

Start wearing purple, wearing purple
Start wearing purple for me now
All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish
I promise, it's just a matter of time

I know you since you were a twenty, I was twenty
And thought that some years from now
A purple little little lady will be perfect
For dirty old and useless clown
So yeah, ha

Start wearing purple, wearing purple
Start wearing purple for me now
All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish
I promise, it's just a matter of time
I know it all from Diogenes to the Foucault
From Lozhechkin to Passepartout
I ya klyanusʹ, obossav dva palʹtsa
Chto muzyka poshla ot "Zvukov MU"!

Start wearing purple, wearing purple
Start wearing purple for me now
All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish
I promise, it's just a matter of time...
So yeah, uh ah uh ah

Start wearing purple, wearing purple
Start wearing purple for me now

So why don't you start wearing purple
Why don't you start wearing purple
Start wearing the purple for me now!

All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish
I promise, it's just a matter of time...
So Vio-vio-violetta! Étta!
Va-va-va-vaya dama ty moya!
Ékh podaĭte nam karetu, vot étu
I my poedem k ebenyam!
So yeah, ah

Start wearing purple, wearing purple
Start wearing purple for me now
All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish
I promise, it's just a matter of time2Embed
