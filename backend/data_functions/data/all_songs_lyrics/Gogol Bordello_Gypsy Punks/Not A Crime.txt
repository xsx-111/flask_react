Not A Crime Lyrics- Я письмо достал, Николай Иванович!
- И опять запрещенное?
- Совершенно запрещенное: Белинского к Гоголю! Ах, Николай Иванович, какое письмо!
Drop the charges!
Запрещенное давай!
The fire and the power, you know?!

(In the old time it was not a crime, drop the charges
You people don't you realise the sun rises?)
(Drop the charges, man! Drop the charges!)
(Right you are! And this time, let the people know...)
In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a crime!
(What are you talking about?)
In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a crime!
Not a crime!
(It's all nonsensical!)
Not a crime!
In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a crime!
In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a crime!

Not a crime!
Drop the charges!
Not a crime!
Not a crime!
Not a crime!
Ох, да запрещенное давай!
Reality!
Чужая душа - потемки...
А своя - тем паче!..
Spices, creation, realisation, naturalisation
What are you talking about? It's all about time 'cos today you go to nature
Not a crime!
In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a crime!
In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a crime!
(Not a crime, not a crime!)
Not a crime!
Not a crime!
Not a crime!
Ох, да запрещенное давай!
Drop the charges, man!
Not a crime!
Drop the charges!
Not a crime!
Сидел нога болтал, работать не хотел
Not a crime!
(It's not a crime, it's legal - perfectly natural)1Embed
