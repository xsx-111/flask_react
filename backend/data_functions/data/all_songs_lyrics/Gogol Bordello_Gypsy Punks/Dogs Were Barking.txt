Dogs Were Barking LyricsDogs were barking, guests were parking
And my wedding was about to start
Dogs were barking, monkeys clapping
Then I got up on table and I said:
I'll meet you 10:45 on the Broadway Canal
In a disco-radical-transglobal...
Beat fun coolo feel sextouro
Выдержит не выдержит ли аппаратура...
А наша мама---Diaspora!!!
Папа в Gogol Bordello!!!
Энергия пробуждения ия-я-я!!!
Dogs were barking, monkeys clapping
Bears were dancing and girls were cutting loose
Cops were lurking, kids were snarkling
Then her father came up to me and said:
Вы бывали когда-нибудь на выставке собак?
She was a 5-45, наше дело - табак...
Да я же старый добрый Opta-Hotza-Htzulo-Dzigit!
Говорят просто больной, да ничего же не болит!
Наша мама ---Diaspora!!!
Папа в Gogol Bordello!!!
Энергия пробуждения ия-я-я!!!
Remember things, things that are eternal...
Remember things...you forgot those things
Нельзя понять, нельзя измерить
Только бросать, и только ввысь!...
To make it all even more crooked
Is impossibility of the suicide
You pull the trigger, yet you are still standing...
Just somewhere else, but with same dick in your hand
And the dogs were barking, and the guests were parking
And the monkeys clapping and girls were cutting loose
Thinking 'bout things, things that are eternal
When her mother came up to me and said
Dogs were barking, cops were lurking
And my dancing was about to start!
Monkeys clapping...
...Party!
...Давай товарищ, like tovarisch would...
I met a crazy dancer
A party tabashi
She held me by the hair I held her by the aaass
...nananana...
She was a crazy dancer...
...nananana...
She was a crazy dancer
Baja kuka napade original mixtura
С улицы до улицы до Брилиан Басура
Beat fun coolo feel sextouro
Выдержит не выдержит ли аппаратура!
...nananana...
And the dogs were barking, and the guests were parking
And the monkeys clapping and girls were cutting loose
Thinking bout things, things that are eternal
When her mother came up to me and said
Dogs were barkingEmbed
