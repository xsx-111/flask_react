Underdog World Strike LyricsI am a foreigner and I'm walking
Through new streets
But before I want to I see the same deeds
Inherited by few a power machine
That crushes you and strangles you
Right in your sleep
But be it me, or it's you, the leisure class
I think we all know:
That be it punk, hip-hop, be it a reggae sound
It is all connected through
The gypsy part of town...
Let's go!
It's the underdog world strike!
It's the underdog world strike!
And let your Girl Scouts lip-synch
About the freedom
Just the way you like them
But soon enough you'll see them
Soon enough they all turn around
And soon enough you'll see them
In a different part of town
But be it me, or it's you, the leisure class
I think we all know:
That be it punk, hip-hop, be it a reggae sound
It is all connected through
The gypsy part of town...
Let's go!
It's the underdog world strike!Embed
