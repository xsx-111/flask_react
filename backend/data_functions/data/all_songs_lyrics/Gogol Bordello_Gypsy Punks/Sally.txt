Sally LyricsSally was a fifteen year old girl from Nebraska
Gypsies were passing through her little town
They dropped something on the road, she picked it up...
And cultural revolution right away begun!
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun
They always were afraid that I was schizophrenic...
They always were afraid что родину продал
А по правде я был просто маленький медведик
Сел на велосипедик и все нахуй проебал...
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun
О, да, да, да
Oh no
Чего?
From all the tables of contents that Mother Earth provides
I'd like to be a big fat fucking fly
The one that spins around your head all day and all night
And sound of it is just like a what?...
...but by the accident of some kind divine dispensation
I ended up being walking United Nation
And I survive even fucking radiation
A big fat fucking what?
And I would visit you a lotEmbed
