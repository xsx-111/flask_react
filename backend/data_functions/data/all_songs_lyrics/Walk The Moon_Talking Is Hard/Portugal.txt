Portugal Lyrics

I know everyone you know
You know everyone I know
Our Venn diagrams are one circle
You grow up when I'm not looking
We grow apart without knowing
And all of a sudden I'm leaving

So I say I'm sorry I can't, I've got plans
As I watch the time slip through my hands
What you don't know now one day you'll learn
Growing up is a heavy leaf to turn
A heavy leaf to turn

Take me with you
'Cause even on your own
You are not alone
Take me with you
'Cause even by yourself
My love, you are something else

One summer turns into ten summers
One lover turns into ten others
But this memory is still with me
So close, bring me in so close
Your clothes, underneath my clothes
Once upon a time in Portugal
So I say I'm sorry I can't, I've got plans
As I watch the time slip through my hands
What you don't know now one day you'll learn
That growing up is a heavy leaf to turn
A heavy leaf to turn

Take me with you
'Cause even on your own
You are not alone
Take me with you
'Cause even by yourself
My love, you are something else

(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
No matter what you want
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Somebody else wants it just as bad
No matter what you got
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Somebody else has got it worse
No matter when I got to you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Somebody else got to you first
So I say I'm sorry I can't, I've got plans
As I watch the time slip through my hands
What you don't know now one day you'll learn
Growing up is a heavy leaf to turn
A heavy leaf to turn
Take me with you
'Cause even on your own
You are not alone
Take me with you
'Cause even by yourself
My love, you are something else
(I know everyone you know)
Take me with you
(You know everyone I know)
'Cause even on your own
(Venn diagrams are one circle)
You are not alone (oh no, you are not alone)
(I know everyone you know)
Take me with you
(You know everyone I know)
'Cause even by yourself
(Venn diagrams are one circle)
You can carry with you anyone else17Embed
