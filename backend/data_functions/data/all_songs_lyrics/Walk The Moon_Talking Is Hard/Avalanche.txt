Avalanche Lyrics
Eighteen / thousand-year-old soul
Midwest shooting star
In the days she waits
But she moonlights rock 'n' roll
Playing a raindance with her guitar
Sometimes you only get one chance

You got a look in your eyes (your eyes)
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night
I don't want to wait 'til the next life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops

Last call and everybody's watching
Her voice rings out like a storm
Sometimes the past echoes in the future
Started long before we were born
Sometimes you only get one chance

Universe won't wait for you
It's do or die, whatcha gon-gon-gonna do?
You got a look in your eyes
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops

You got a look in your eyes
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night
I don't want to wait 'til the next life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops14Embed
