Sidekick Lyrics
We walk out the cinema
About to go our separate ways and I...
I almost wave goodbye
When you let your hair fall in your face
And I often wonder why the things that I want
Are so hard to find
But I often fail to see the things that I need
Are right here by my side

Something in the air is giving me bad ideas
Something in the air is giving me dangerous thoughts like:

Why don’t you stay at mine tonight?
(Why don’t you stay at mine tonight?)
Why don’t you stay with me and be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick?

Keys left hanging in the door
A trail of shoes and winter coats
And we’re kissing on the kitchen floor
Our friendship up against the ropes
And don’t you wonder why
The things that you want
Are so hard to find
Well it just occurred to me
The one that I need
Could be right here by my side
Something in the air is giving me bad ideas
Something in the air is giving me wicked thoughts like:

Why don’t you stay at mine tonight?
(Why don’t you stay at mine tonight?)
Why don’t you stay with me and be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you want to be my?
Do you want to be my?
Do you want to be my?

Something in the air is giving me bad ideas
Something in the air is telling me you could be my sidekick, sidekick
Do you, do you, do you wanna be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick?
If so, come on LET’S GO!!
AY AY AY AY!
