We Are the Kids Lyrics
Don't wanna wait 'til the morning
Don't wanna wait 'til the morning comes
You know the bigger picture changes when your colors run
I got my hand in my pocket
And there's a diamond at my fingertips
Don't wanna wait 'til the morning
You and I, we live for this

I rip holes in my shirt
There's mud on my shoes
There's sun on my skin
I am brand-new
We shout at the cops
We howl at the moon
Just a matter of time
Don'tcha get it?

We are the kids that you never can kill
You never can kill, you never can kill
You say that we won't, but you know that we will
You know that we will keep on

Don't wanna wait for permission
We got our own fresh set of rules
We take that old school fashion, shape it into something new
You got your hand in my pocket
You like to dance with my fingertips
Don't gotta wait for permission
You and I, we live for this
We are the kids that you never can kill
You never can kill, you never can kill
You say that we won't, but you know that we will
You know that we will keep on
I said
We are the kids that you never can kill
You never can kill, you never can kill
You say that we won't, but you know that we will
You know that we will keep on

Lost boys lost girls
High tides wild animals
We won't live forever
Hand over the future
Hand over the future
Hand over the future
Hand over the future
Now now now now

I rip holes in my shirt
There's mud on my shoes
There's sun on my skin
I am brand-new
We shout at the cops
We howl at the moon
Just a matter of time
Don'tcha get it?
We are the kids that you never can kill
You never can kill, you never can kill
You say that we won't, but you know that we will
You know that we will keep on
I said
We are the kids that you never can kill
You never can kill, you never can kill
You say that we won't, but you know that we will
You know that we will keep on
C'mon
Hand over the future
Hand over the future
Hand over the future
Hand over the future
Lost boys lost girls
Hand over the future
Hand over the future
Now now now now6Embed
