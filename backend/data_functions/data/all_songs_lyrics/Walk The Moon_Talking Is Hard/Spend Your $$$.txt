Spend Your $$$ Lyrics
Can you imagine?

The TV says Mother is hurtin'
That the clock reads quarter to twelve
So I shop my face off at Urban
Just trying to look a little more like myself

What do you spend your money on?
I hope it's something of value!
What do you spend your money on?

The first time to your apartment
I was peeking in between my fingers
Oh the things I hoped we had in common
Wishful thinker

What do you spend your money on?
I hope it's something of value
Are you the driver or is someone driving you?
What do you spend, spend your
What do you spend on your money on?
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

You take me up to the party and we cross right over the barrier
I'm not sure what's more disarming than fake breasts and miniature terriers

What do you spend your money on?
I hope it's something of value!
Are you the driver or is someone driving you?
What do you spend on spend on
What do you spend on your money on?
I hope it's something of value!2Embed
