Up 2 U Lyrics
You better trust that voice in your head
That your world is not what it seems
It's not the monster under your bed
It's the one with you in the sheets

It's hard enough just making money
It's hard enough just trying to feel alive
Meanwhile our fever is running
And kings bow down to the dollar sign
(Change)
Well don't ask me, don't ask me to change (change)
Cha-a-ange

It's up to you

Giants think the world is theirs
Well I got a handful of magic beans
And there's a raindance in my head
And if you want a storm come dance with me

It's hard enough just making money
It's hard enough just trying to feel alive
Meanwhile our fever is running
And kings bow down to the bottom line
(Change) Well don't ask me, don't ask me to change (change)
It's up to you
It's up to you

(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
I can't believe my eyes
Got to believe there's some way
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
I can't believe my eyes
Got to believe there's some way
I can't believe my eyes
Got to believe there's some way
I can't believe my eyes
I can't believe my eyes

It's up to you6Embed
