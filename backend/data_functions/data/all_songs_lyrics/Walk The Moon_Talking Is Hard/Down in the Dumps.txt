Down in the Dumps Lyrics
I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
No, I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
You can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down

Way back in '95: scraped knees, tough love, ah yea
Grass stains were just a sign of the times
Big kids look at us now, too adult to say "big whoop"
Letting any old bummer get under my hide
But ooh, I'm gonna take control

I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
No, I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps

So I'll walk that tightrope wire
But what am I really made of?
Scared of heights like I'm scared of falling in love
But ooh, I'm gonna take control

Because I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
No, I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
You can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
But I wonâ€™t let you bring me back, bring me back down

So think back to '95
And reach arms-length deep, ah yea
Cause they'll try to pierce your childhood hide
But ooh, I'm gonna take control

I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
No, I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
I said, I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
No, I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down in the dumps
You can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring me back, bring me back down
You can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring, bring me back6Embed
