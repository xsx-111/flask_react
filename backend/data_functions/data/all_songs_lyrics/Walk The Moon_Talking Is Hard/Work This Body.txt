Work This Body Lyrics
It was a strange place and a tender age
I was just a babe in school
Saw them roll their eyes at me every time that I thought that I was cool
Well God knows I was no chosen one
That just wasn't my prime
Yeah it's just a matter of time, honey
It's just a matter of time

And I will work this body
I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night and in the pouring rain
Yeah I'm a workaholic and I swear, I swear
Yeah one day I will beat you fair and square
Show me what you got
Work this body on the floor
Who do you think you are?
C'mon meet me on the court
Que ferais-tu?
Putain, Je ne sais pas!

It ain't no matter of “if” honey
It's just a matter of “when”
Oh, some Sunday when it's my face in the newspaper again
All the rag magazines, black limousines, they'll be getting in line
Yeah it's just a matter of time, honey
It's just a matter of time
And I will work this body
I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night and in the pouring rain
Yeah I'm a workaholic and I swear, I swear
Yeah one day I will beat you fair and square
Show me what you got
Work this body on the floor
Just who do you think you are?
C'mon meet me on the court
Que ferais-tu?
Putain, Je ne sais pas!
Ne vien pas pleurer vers moi…

And I will work this body
I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night and in the pouring rain
Yeah I'm a workaholic and I swear, I swear
Yeah one day I will beat you fair and square
And I will work this body
I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night and in the pouring rain
Yeah I'm a workaholic and I swear, I swear
Yeah one day I will beat you fair and square9Embed
