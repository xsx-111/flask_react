Aquaman Lyrics
The real-life love
Is under the mirror of the surface
So cut my cord
I wanna know how deep we can take it
See the thing you've been chasin', honey
You'll never find it wearing a life-vest
You gotta risk your neck
But know in your heart it will be worth it

So here we go
Head first, and no regrets
And no rules—we can stay as long as we want
Slow-dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on

It's been my fashion to keep my head dry and get my feet wet
But step by step, I've been letting you lead me towards the deep end
Well I learned my lesson, honey
Just when you think you're all adult swim
That's precisely when somebody shows you to the ocean

So here we go
Head first, and no regrets
And no rules—we can stay as long as we want
Slow-dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
Just keep holding on, holding on to me
Under, under the troubled surface of the sea
Just keep holding on, holding on to me
Just keep holding on, holding on to me
Oh here we go

Head first, and no regrets
And no rules—we can stay as long as we want
Slow-dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
Head first, into the water
And so it hits me—I guess we could breathe all along
One breath after another
All I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on13Embed
