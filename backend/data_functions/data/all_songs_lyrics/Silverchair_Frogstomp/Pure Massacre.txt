Pure Massacre Lyrics
People dying for no reason at all
Age is no difference or if you're large or small

Families being torn apart
Doesn't have to be this way
Some people, just have no heart
It's happening every day

Pure massacre
Pure massacre...
Pure massacre
Pure massacre...

Machine guns pumping, hearts thumping
Death is all around
People crying for freedom
No one hears the sound

Pure massacre
Pure massacre...
Pure massacre
Pure massacre...
There's people crying
There's people dying
But someone's taken it all, yeah

Machine guns pumping, hearts thumping
Death is all around
People crying for freedom
No one hears the sound

Pure massacre
Pure massacre...
Pure massacre
Pure massacre...
Pure massacre
Pure massacre...
Pure massacre
Pure massacre...

It's gonna be a pure massacre
Yeah!1Embed
