Findaway Lyrics
One, two, three, four

You've been locked up, and you need to escape
You broke the law, it was your first offence
Drug addiction, subtracting all your privileges
But giving up just makes no sense

We'll find a way
We'll find a way

Don't give in, don't give in
Don't give in, don't give in
Ohhh

All you can think about is breaking free
You can't make it on your own
You're thinking negative, nothing can go right
It's eating you down to the bone

We'll find a way
We'll find a way
Don't give in, don't give in
Don't give in, don't give in
Ohhh
 Ohh, ohh, ohh

We'll find a way
We'll find a way

Don't give in, don't give in
Don't give in, don't give in
OhhhEmbed
