Tomorrow Lyrics
It's twelve o'clock and it's a wonderful day
I know you hate me, but I'll ask anyway
Won't you come with me to a place in a little town?
The only way to get there's to go straight down
There's no bathroom and there is no sink
The water out of the tap is very hard to drink

Very hard to drink

You wait 'til tomorrow
You wait 'til tomorrow

You say that money isn't everything
But I'd like to see you live without it
You think you can keep on going living like a king
Ooh, babe, but I strongly doubt it

Very hard to drink
Very hard to drink

You gonna wait 'til, fat boy
Fat boy, wait 'til tomorrow
You gonna wait 'til, fat boy
Fat boy, wait 'til tomorrow
You wait 'til tomorrow
You wait 'til tomorrow
You gonna wait 'til, fat boy
Fat boy, wait 'til tomorrow
You gonna wait 'til, fat boy
Fat boy, wait 'til tomorrow
Oh, yeah5Embed
