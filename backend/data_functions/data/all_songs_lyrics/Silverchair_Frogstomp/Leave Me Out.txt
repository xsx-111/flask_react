Leave Me Out Lyrics
Ohh, you can lead a throne
But I'm something you don't own
No...
Greed is a sin
So don't lead me in
Ohh...

Ohh, you can leave me out
Leave me out
Leave me out
Ohh, ohh, yeah


Ohh, you can leave me out
Leave me out
Leave me out
Ohh, ohh, yeah yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh


You can leave me out
Leave me out
Leave me out
Ohh, ohh, yeahEmbed
