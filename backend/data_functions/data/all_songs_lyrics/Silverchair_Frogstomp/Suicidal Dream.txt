Suicidal Dream Lyrics
I dream about how It's gonna end
Approaching me quickly
Living life of fear
I only want my mind to be clear
People making fun of me
For no reason but jealousy
I fantasize about my death
I kill myself from holding my breathe

My suicidal dream
Voices telling me what to do
My suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too

Help me comfort me
Stop me from feeling what I'm feeling now
The rope is here
Now I'll find a use
I'll kill myself
I'll put my head in a noose

My suicidal dream
Voices telling me what to do
My suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too
Dreaming about my death, dream
Suicidal, suicidal, suicidal dream
Suicidal, suicidal dreamEmbed
