Undecided Lyrics
Ohh, there's no time
To choose for yourself
It's like the candle's lit at both ends now
Deteriorating health
Parent's breakin' up
Wish they would decide
Whether to stay together
Can't make up their minds

They wonder why you need someone
You get no freedom at all
They want you to drop down and conform
They make your self-esteem fall

Undecided, can't make up their mind
Your parents collided and left you behind

If there's a lock to their minds
Can you tell me please
I'll be straight
Straight to get the keys
Undecided, can't make up their mind
Your parents collided and left you behind

Her mother doesn't even know her name...
Undecided
If there is trouble, well she just gets the blame
But denies it

Undecided, can't make up their mind
Your parents collided and left you behind

Undecided
Undecided
Undecided
Undecided
