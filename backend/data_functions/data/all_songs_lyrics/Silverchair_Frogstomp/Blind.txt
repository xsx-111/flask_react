Blind LyricsI need to get out
There's something wrong 'round here
I have no doubt
We're all gonna die from fear
Everything's dark
And I cannot find
What I've been looking for
So I'd have to say I'm blind
But he cannot see
Yeah, he cannot see
He's blind
Oh, yeah
I'm blind
Oh, I'm blind
If you do
Shed a tear
Don't come to my place
Because I
I won't be here
There's no love lost
Between you and me
And that's the way that I like it
I wanna live life like a normal man
And I think I can
But he cannot see
Yeah
He cannot see
He's blind
Oh, yeah
I'm blind
Yeah, oooh
No, oh
Yeah
