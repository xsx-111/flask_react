Blue and Lonesome (Live) LyricsThe lonesome sound of a train going by, Make me wanna stop and cry
I recall the day he took you a way, I'm blue, I'm lonesome, too
When I'm hear that whistle blow, I wanna pack my suitcase and go
The lonesome sound of a train going by, Make me wanna stop and cry
In the still of the night, in the pale moonlight, The wind it moans and sighs
There awful blues, I just can't lose. I'm blue, I'm lonesome, too
When I'm hear that whistle blow, I wanna pack my suitcase and go
The lonesome sound of a train going by, Make me wanna stop and cryEmbed
