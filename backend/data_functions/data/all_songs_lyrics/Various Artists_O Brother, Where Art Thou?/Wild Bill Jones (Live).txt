Wild Bill Jones (Live) LyricsAs I went down for to take a little walk
I came upon that Wild Bill Jones
He was a walkin' and a talkin' by my true lover's side
And I bid him to leave her alone
He said my age is twenty one
Too old to be controlled
I pulled my revolver from my side
And I destroyed that poor boy's soul
He reeled and he staggered and he fell to the ground
And then he gave one dying moan
He wrapped his arms around my little girl's neck
Saying, "Honey, won't you take me home?"
So put them handcuffs on me boys
And lead me to that freight car gate
I have no friends or relations there
No one for to go my bail
So pass around that old long necked bottle
And we'll all go on a spree
Today I saw the last of Wild Bill Jones
And tomorrow'll be the last of me...Embed
