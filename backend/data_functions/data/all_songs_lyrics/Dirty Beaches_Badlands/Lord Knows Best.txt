Lord Knows Best LyricsThe Lord knows best
When it comes to you
And you know well that I
Don't give a damn about anything
But you
Oh, yes, you do!
I've traveled through the streets
And I've walked through the valleys
The Lord knows best that I
Don't give a damn about anyone but you
Oh, yes, He does!
The Lord knows best
When it comes to you
Oh, yes, He does!
When it comes to you
Oh, yes, He does!
When it comes to you
Oh, yes, He does!
When it comes to you1Embed
