Horses LyricsBlack horses riding in the dead of the night
I can see them loose horsemen entering you
I can hear them screaming, calling out my name
When you hear them sounds, it's calling out yours too
Black horses ride in the dead of the night
I can see the patterns putting the inner work out
And when they hear them screaming back, I can hear them neigh
And when you hear them scream, it's calling out yours too
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Let us stay somewhere away from you
When you hear screaming, it's calling your name
They're here to steal your soul away from you
When you hear them sounds, it's calling out yours too
Black horses riding in the dead of the night
I can see them loose horsemen entering you
I can hear them screaming, calling out my name
When you hear them sounds, it's calling out you too
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
They're here to steal your soul away from you
And when you hear screaming, it's calling out your name
They're here to steal your soul away from you
When you hear them sounds, it's calling out yours too
Black horses ride
Black horses ride
They're here to steal your soul
They're here to steal your soulEmbed
