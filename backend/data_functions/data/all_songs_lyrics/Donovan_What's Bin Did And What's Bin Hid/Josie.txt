Josie LyricsJosie, I won't fail ya
I won't fail you, have no fear
Josie, I won't fail ya
Give me one more chance, the day is near
The meadows they are burstin'
The yellow corn lies in your hand
And with the night comes sorrow
As the tide of dawn slips on the land
The long breezes are blowin'
All down the sky, into my face
I've a weary kind of feelin'
Like my time has come and gone to waste
I love you darlin' Josie
The trees of pine they grow so tall
How come you came to love me
When you didn't love me at all
Josie, I won't fail ya
I won't fail you, have no fear
Josie I won't fail ya
Give me one more chance, the day is near
My Josie looks a child now
As she lies beyond my breast
In the night I think about her
In the day, I get no rest
I cut me a young pine cone
And I gave it to the river deep
It sail'd 'way by your window
Where you lay so long in sleep
God bless you darlin' Josie
With your sparkling eyes so bright and clear
Josie, I won't fail ya
I won't fail you, have no fear
Josie, I won't fail ya
I won't fail you, have no fear
Josie, I won't fail ya
Give me one more chance, the day is nearEmbed
