Shallow Then Halo Lyrics
Winged water
Feathered river
Dirty rich soil
Strong and fertile

Winged water
Feathered river
Dirty rich soil
Strong and fertile

The then shallow she
Earth as we know it
The then hallow she
A sky for the sacred

Stars in my eyes
Stars in my face
Womb in the belly
Capital place
Stars in my eyes
Stars in my face
Womb in the belly
Capital place
The then shallow she
Earth as we know it
The then hallow she
A sky for the sacred
In my
In my
In my
In my
In my
In my

Winged water
Feathered river
Dirty rich soil
Strong and fertile
Winged water
Feathered river
Dirty rich soil
Strong and fertile

Stars in my eyes
Stars in my face
Womb in the belly
Capital place
Stars in my eyes
Stars in my face
Womb in the belly
Capital place

In my eyes (at my...)
In my eyes (stars in my eyes)
At my feet (at my...)
In my eyes
At my feet
Stars in my eyes
Stars at my feet
I have stars in my eyes (stars at my feet)
Stars in my eyes (I have stars at my feet)
Stars in my eyes
Stars at my feet
Stars
Narada
Narada
Narada
Stars at my arms, stars at my feet
Stars at my arms, stars at my feet
Stars at my arms, stars at my feetEmbed
