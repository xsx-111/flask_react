Blood Bitch LyricsBlood woman
Blood bitch
There's a corona
A corona swelling
Pressing hands
Against the scar
There's no warmth
There's no warmth to be felt
Sometimes it’s dry water
Sometimes it’s cold flame
Neither one or the other
Has much form or shape
Cold burns powerful
Has powerful needs
Holds back
Whispered words of fire
I’ll paint the blood bitch
The blood bitch black
Lift up your heels
You’ll see burnt soles2Embed
