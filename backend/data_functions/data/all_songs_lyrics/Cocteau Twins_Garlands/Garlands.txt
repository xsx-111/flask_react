Garlands LyricsGarlands evergreen
Forget-me-not wreaths
Chaplets see me drugged
I could die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Well with these sweet garlands
We’ll never find out (Lana)
We’ll never find out (Dinah)
Walk with these stitches
Cravings come out (cravings)
My cravings come out (out then)
Garlands evergreen
Forget-me-not wreaths
Chaplets see me drugged
I could die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Well with these scarce scars
Cravings come out (cravings)
My cravings come out (out then)
Well with these strange scars
I’m more bound to
I’m more bound to
Garlands evergreen
Forget-me-not wreaths
Chaplets see me drugged
I could die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Well with these dark glasses
Cravings come out (cravings)
My cravings come out (out then)
Well with these stitches
I’m more bound to
I’m more bound toEmbed
