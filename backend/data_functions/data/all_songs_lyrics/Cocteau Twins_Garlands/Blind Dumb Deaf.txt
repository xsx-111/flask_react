Blind Dumb Deaf LyricsBlind, dumb, deaf and I’ll find
I was never a part of it (blind deaf)
Blind, dumb, deaf and I’ll find
I was never a part of it (blind deaf)
At the bosom or the breast
At the forehead or the fist
Blind, dumb, deaf and I’ll find
I was never a part of it
Blind, dumb, deaf and I’ll find
I was never a part of it (lay-ay)
My mouthing at you
My tongue the stake
I should welt, should I hold you
I should gash, should I kiss you
Blind, dumb, deaf and I’ll find
I was never a part of it
Blind, dumb, deaf and I’ll find
I was never a part of it (daydaydaydayday)Embed
