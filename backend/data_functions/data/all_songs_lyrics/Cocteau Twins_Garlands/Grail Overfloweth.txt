Grail Overfloweth LyricsGrail overfloweth
There is rain
And there is ink and there is love
Grail overfloweth
There is rain
And there is ink and there is love
Grail overfloweth
There is rain
And there’s saliva and there’s you
Grail flood on the outside
I see
It’s not me
It’s your whole world
You see you
It’s me
Who sees you
Well, I don’t know, I said its name
Well, I don’t know, I said it’s you again
Grail overfloweth
There is me again
There is you and me
There is me again
When I open my eyes
There is me again
There is rain
RainEmbed
