Wendell Gee Lyrics
That's when Wendell Gee
Takes a tug upon the string
That held the line of trees
Behind the house he lived in
He was reared to give respect
But somewhere down the line, he chose...

To whistle as the wind blows (Gonna miss you, boy)
And whistle as the wind blows did he (Gonna miss you, boy)

He had a dream one night
That the tree had lost its middle
So he built a trunk of chicken wire
To try to hold it up
But the wire, the wire turned to lizard skin
And when he climbed inside...

There wasn't even time to say (Gonna miss you, boy)
Goodbye to Wendell Gee (Gonna miss you, boy)
So whistle as the wind blows (Gonna miss you, boy)
Whistle as the wind blows did he (Gonna miss you, boy)
There wasn't even time to say (Gonna miss you, boy)
Goodbye to Wendell Gee (Gonna miss you, boy)
So whistle as the wind blows (Gonna miss you, boy)
And listen as the wind blows did he (Gonna miss you, boy)

If the wind were colors (Gonna miss you, boy)
And if the air could speak (Gonna miss you, boy)
Then whistle as the wind blows (Gonna miss you, boy)
And whistle as the wind blows (Gonna miss you, boy)Embed
