Auctioneer (Another Engine) Lyrics
She didn't want to get pinned down by her prior town
Get me to the train on time, here, take this nickel, make a dime
Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave
What is at the other end? I don't know, another friend
Another wife, another morning spent

Listen, listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

We never wrote the reasons that I need explained
Some things are givens and others get away
This time, it's for myself, you call it what you may
Okay, we won't say goodbye so long, so much more

And listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

Listen to the bargain holler
Listen to the barter holler
Listen to the auctioneer
Get me to the train on time
Here, take this nickel, make a dime
Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave
What is at the other end?
I don't know, another friend
Another wife, another morning spent

Listen, listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine
Another engine, another engine

Do I stand the bargain holler? Listen to the barter hollerEmbed
