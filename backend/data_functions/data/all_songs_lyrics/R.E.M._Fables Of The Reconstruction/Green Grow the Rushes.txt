Green Grow the Rushes Lyrics
The wheelbarrow's fallen
Look at my hands
They've found some surplus cheaper hands
Rubbing palms and pick and choose
Who will they choose?
Here is the news

Look at that building
Look at this man
Haloed and whitewashed
Gone to find a cheaper hand
He'll offer a pound
Offer a pound

Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
The compass points the workers home

Pay for your freedom
Or find another gate
Guilt by associate
The rushes wilted a long time ago
Guilty as you go
Stay off that highway
Word is, it's not so safe
The grasses that hide the greenback
The amber waves of gain again
The amber waves of grain

Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
The compass points the workers home

La-la-la la la lye (Green grow the rushes go)
La-la-la la la lye (Green grow the rushes go)
La-la-la la la lye (Green grow the rushes go)

La-la-la la la lye (Green grow the rushes go)
La-la-la la la lye (Green grow the rushes go)
La-la-la la la lye (Green grow the rushes go)Embed
