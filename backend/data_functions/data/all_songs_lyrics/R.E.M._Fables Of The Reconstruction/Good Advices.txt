Good Advices Lyrics
When you greet a stranger
Look at his shoes
Keep your money in your shoes
Put your trouble behind
When you greet a stranger
Look at her hands
Keep your money in your hands
Put your travel behind

Who are you going to call for?
What do you have to say?
Keep your hat on your head
Home is a long way away

At the end of the day, I'll forget your name
I'd like it here if I could leave
And see you from a long way away

When you greet a stranger
Look at his shoes
Keep your memories in your shoes
Put your travel behind
Who are you going to call for?
What do you have to say?
Keep your hat on your head
Home is a long way away

At the end of the day
When there are no friends
When there are no lovers
Who are you going to call for?
What do you have to change?
A familiar face, a foreign place
I'll forget your name
I'd like it here if I could leave
And see you from a long way away

Who are you going to call for?
What do you have to say?
Keep your hat on your head
Home is a long way awayEmbed
