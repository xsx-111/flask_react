Maps and Legends Lyrics
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached

Called the fool and the company
On his own, where he'd rather be
Where he ought to be
And he sees what you can't see, can't you see that?
(He sees what you can't see)

Maybe he's caught in the legend
Maybe he's caught in the mood
Maybe these maps and legends
Have been misunderstood

Down the way, the road's divided
Paint me the places you've seen
Those who know what I don't know
Refer to the yellow, red, and green
(Can't you see that?)

Maybe he's caught in the legend
Maybe he's caught in the mood
Maybe these maps and legends
Have been misunderstood
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached

The map that you've painted doesn't seem real
He just sings whatever he's seen
Point to the legend, point to the east
Point to the yellow, red, and green

Maybe he's caught in the legend
Maybe he's caught in the mood
Maybe these maps and legends
Have been misunderstood
Have been misunderstood

Is he to be reached? He's not to be reached
Is he to be reached? He's not to be reached
Is he to be reached? He's not to be reached anymore1Embed
