Old Man Kensey Lyrics
Old man Kensey
Wants to be a sign painter
First, he's got to learn to read
He's going to be a clown on TV
Flexes his elbow, taut and free
(That's my folly) I believe

Drink up the lake
Kensey's awake
(If that's my folly)
That's my mistake

Old man Kensey
Wants to be a goalie
First, he's got to learn to count
He's going to be a clown on a circus mount
Letters to me signed in sopped up tar
(That's my folly) Kensey's going far

John, Bill and Ed
Stand on your head
(If that's my folly)
I'm ready to go
Old man Kensey
Wants to be a dog catcher
First, he's got to learn to stand
He's gonna be a clown in a marching band
Letters to me signed, ransom, greed
(If that's my folly) I believe

Drink up the lake
John, Bill and Ed
(If that's my folly)
That's my mistake
Kensey's awake
Stand on your head
(If that's my folly)
I'm ready to go

Drink up the lake
Stand on your head
(If that's my folly)
I'm ready to goEmbed
