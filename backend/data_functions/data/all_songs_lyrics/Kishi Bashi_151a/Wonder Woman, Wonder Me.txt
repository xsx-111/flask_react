Wonder Woman, Wonder Me Lyrics
When candy was a remedy, we'd make it up
We'd destroy ourselves in the yard, the yard
I held you in a wooden place, I was hungry then
It was hours before it went dark, went dark
Oh wonder woman, wonder me
You bewitched me with your gold and blue from the start, the start

Kin-kon-kan-kon, kaneganaru
Kin-kon-kan-kon, kaneganaru
Kin-kon-kan-kon, kaneganaru
Kin-kon-kan-kon, kaneganaru

When Pluto was demoted I
Felt a sigh of relief, I never knew why, knew why
Like all the things in The Quickening, we share the fallen few
There can be only one, only one

Kin-kon-kan-kon, kaneganaru
Kin-kon-kan-kon, kaneganaru
Kin-kon-kan-kon

And when at night I'd find that silent space
Where I'd gouged my heart for you
Where dreams dwelled safe is now a dangerous place
For idle thoughts anew
Kin-kon-kan-kon, kaneganaru
Kin-kon-kan-kon, kaneganaru

Memories overtaken by
The desire to throw them away and into the sky, the sky
Bound by the Newtonian
He said what goes up must always come down, come downEmbed
