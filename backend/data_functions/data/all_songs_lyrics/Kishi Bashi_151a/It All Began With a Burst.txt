It All Began With a Burst Lyrics
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta

And the source was your laughter, threw me off the wall
Used your face as a mascot, ay-ay-ay
And the medicine came after, left me in a storm
Many miles from the Cessna
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta

One of many in the mess hall, family there and all
Making money on the desktop, ay-ay-ay
Was at war with the fast cars, many chemicals
In the eyes of the master (Burst!)
(Master in every way)
Sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, sa
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta

For the love of the soft game, ay-ay-ay
Made of models set in plaster, ay-ay-ay
When in doubt of the last year, gather all your fear
Dip your hand in the blender (Burst!)
In your wallet was your gender, stolen when in Rome
In the shadow of your blender, ay-ay-ay
Was a secret of the bedroom, blemish in the chrome
In the eye of the bender (Burst!)

(Chiku!)
Sa ka ni sa, sa ka ni sa, sa ka ni sa, sa ka ni sa
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa kesa kesa
Kesa ka ni sasareta kesa ka ni sasareta
Ke-sa ka ni sa-sa-re-ta

It all began with a burst now, every several months
And the chemicals came after, ay-ay-ay
It was a race to be faster, quicker than the worst
In the style of the master
(Burst!)Embed
