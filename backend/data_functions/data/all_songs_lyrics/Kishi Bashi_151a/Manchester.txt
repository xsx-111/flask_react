Manchester Lyrics
I wrote me a book
I hid the last page
I didn't even look
I think I locked it in a cage
Wrote a novel
Cause everybody likes to read a novel
It started with a word
And it started pretty well
About a rare and fragile bird that I couldn't even spell
On the table
I think I left it on the table
I found the last page in the sky
Cold and sweet, like an apple
I found you and now the story has its proper end

Oh hello
Will you be mine?
I haven't felt this alive in a long time
All the streets are warm today
I read the signs
I haven't been this in love in a long time
The sun is up, the sun will stay
All for the new day
The very last breath of the hero of our tale
Would you only to guess
Did he truly prevail
In the the sequel?
I guess I'll have to write a sequel
My favorite part's when I die
In your arms like a movie
It's tragic, but now the story has its proper end

Oh hello
Will you be mine?
I haven't felt this alive in a long time
All the streets are warm and grey
I read the signs
I haven't been this in love in a long time
The sun is up the sun will stay
All for the new day

Will you be mine?
The days are short and I've wrote me my last rhyme
All the streets are warm today
I read the signs
I haven't been this in love in a long time
It's been a long timeEmbed
