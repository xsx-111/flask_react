Bring Me Simple Men Lyrics
Welcome back, my battered brother
Shake hard and take the upper hand
And may it never be forgotten
Who here is the better man
But there's no competition, buddy
And why it doesn't need to hurt
You can keep the motor running
I'll unload into the dirt

Bring me simple men free of pride
I like simple men true and tried

Take a lesson here from Abel
Leave your swagger by the way
There's an element unstable
That your confidence betrays
Every big shot is a hunter
Every hunter's got his prey
You can tell me I'm a good sport
But that doesn't make me game

Just a simple friend, I like simple men
