Run from Me Lyrics
Run from me, darlin'
Run, my good wife
Run from me, darlin'
You better run for your life

Run from me, baby
Run, my good wife
Run from me, baby
You better run for your life

And each time I see you
I contemplate
What I love most of all
Your swinging gait

Run from me, darlin'
Run, my good wife
Run from me, darlin'
You better run for your life

Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, runEmbed
