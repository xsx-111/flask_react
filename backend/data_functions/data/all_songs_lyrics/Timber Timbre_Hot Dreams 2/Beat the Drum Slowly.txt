Beat the Drum Slowly Lyrics
Deco tower, rainbow fountain shower
Crystal column, silver tabloid entry
The celebrity century
A faded trait of the golden age
That flickered out into celluloid ashes
Phantasms fantastic

Outran the avalanche
Outran the avalanche
Outran the avalanche to the cameras rolling
We beat the drum slowly

The family jewels, the swimming pool
Yards marked by emerald coffins
We heard crimes often and softly
A mystery mist, new systems shift
Things recognized from television channels
Nostalgia signals, unscrambled
