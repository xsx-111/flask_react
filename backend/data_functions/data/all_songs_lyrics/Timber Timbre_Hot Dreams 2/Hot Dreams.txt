Hot Dreams Lyrics
I wanna dance, I wanna dance, I wanna dance with a black woman
I wanna still, I wanna still, I wanna still my mind
And I want a chance, I want a chance, I want another chance
To distill, to distill their time

And I wanna write, I wanna write, I wanna write
To someone so true
I wanna wake, I wanna wake, I wanna wake
From hot dreams, hot dreams of you
Oh, hot dreams
(Hot dreams)
(Hot dreams)

I wanna rise, I wanna rise, I wanna rise up beside you
I want to be, I want to be, I want to be a champion in your eyes
And I will follow through, follow through on all my promises and threats to you, babe
Hot streams, hot streams will fork and divide, fork and divide

I wanna take, I wanna take, I wanna take
Take all of your air
I wanna find, I wanna find, I wanna find
Another daydream, another nightmare
I wanna lie, I wanna lie, I wanna lie
Lie me down in your stream
I wanna wake, I wanna wake
I wanna wake from hot dreams
I wanna wake from hot dreams of you, babe (Hot dreams)
I wanna wake from hot dreams of you, babe (Hot dreams)
