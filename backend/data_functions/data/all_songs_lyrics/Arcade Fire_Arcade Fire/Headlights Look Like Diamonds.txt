Headlights Look Like Diamonds Lyrics
The red lights mean you're leaving
The white ones mean returning
Tell me how this story ends
And I'll keep them fires burning

The headlights look like diamonds
The taillights burn like coals
Tell me how this story ends
Before the fires go cold

The countryside's deserted
There's no one on the farms
The suburbs all are sleeping
The earthquakes set off car alarms

All after all now we aware
All after all the time we share
There's so much fears of world
Hopes of world, tears of worldEmbed
