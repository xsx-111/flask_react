The Woodlands National Anthem Lyrics
I guess we'll have to move
The neighborhood is on to us
Let's join the little babes
Throwing rocks in front of us

Riding on my bicycle
I pass my sister on a bus
Let's take the country road
Before our parents send for us

Trees keep falling at my feet
I guess it's time to build a boat
Make a raft of our bodies
Do you think that it'll float

What I said was not a joke
But you just licked the envelope
I'm tired of dating, let's elope
But you just licked the envelope

Three cheers for my parents
Lonely failed experiments!
Three cheers for my parents
Lonely failed experiments!
Don't you dare blame my parents
I'm the only failed experiment
Don't you dare blame your parents
You're the only failed experiment
Don't you dare blame your grandparents
Mom's the only failed experiment
Don't you dare blame your grandparents
Dad's the only failed experiment
Don't blame God
Just blame God
Don't blame GodEmbed
