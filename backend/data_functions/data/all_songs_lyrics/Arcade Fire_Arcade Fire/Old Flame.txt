Old Flame Lyrics
You knew in five minutes
But I knew in a sentence
You knew in five minutes
But I knew in a sentence

So why do we go
Through all of this again
Your eyes are fluttering
Such pretty wings
A moth, flying into the
Same old flame again
It never ends

It's not like I dropped the bomb
On my conscience mom
It takes fightin' day and night
To make such a good thing die
Out, everyone out
I give too much shit at home
In my heart and mind
It gets me every time
