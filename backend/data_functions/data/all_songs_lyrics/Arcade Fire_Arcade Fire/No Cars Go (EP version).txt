No Cars Go (EP version) LyricsWe know a place where no planes go!
We know a place where no ships go!

Hey!
No cars go!
Hey!
No cars go, where we know!
We know a place no spaceships go!
We know a place where no subs go!

Us kids know!
No cars go!
Where we know!

Between the click of the light and the start of the dream!
I don't want any pushing and I don't want any shoving
We're gonna do this in an orderly manner
Women and children! Women and children!
Women and children, let's go!
Old folks! Let's go!
Babies needing cribs! Let's go!Embed
