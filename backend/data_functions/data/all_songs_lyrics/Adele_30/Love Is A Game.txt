Love Is A Game Lyrics
All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely, you know that I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see

That love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

How unbelievable (Unbelievable)
Of me to fall for the lies that I tell (Lies I tell)
The dream that I sell (Dream I sell)
When heartache, it's inevitable (It's inevitable)
But I'm no good at doing it well
Not that I care (I don't care)
Why should anything about it be fair?
When love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

No amount of love
Can keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied)
I can't keep up (Can't keep up, can't keep up)
When I keep changing my mind (Change my mind, change my mind)
The feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise

Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

Oh, you know I'd do it all again
I love it now like I loved it then
I'm a fool for them
You know I'm, you know I'm gonna do it, oh
I'll do it all again like I did then7Embed
