In the Darkest Place Lyrics
In the darkest place
I know
That is where you'll find me
Even though you didn't have to remind me
I shut out the lights

Your eyes adjust
They'll never be the same
You know I love you so
Lets start again

Since you put me down
It seems
I've been very gloomy
You may laugh, but pretty girls look right through me
They don't sense the faintest glimmering
That is the torch I bear
There's light enough for me to find my way
But I only have to tell myself that by now
You could be with someone else
Is there light beneath your door and
Laughter from within?
Do your friends come around
Saying, "Try to find another lover"?
He won't love you like I do
In the darkest place
I'm lost
I have abandoned every hope
Maybe you'll understand I must
Shut out the light

Do your friends come around
Saying, "Try to find another lover"?
He won't love you like I do
In the darkest place, that is where you'll find me Embed
