Tears at the Birthday Party Lyrics
Think back now when we were young
There were always tears at the birthday party
You know how children can be
So cruel
That's how it starts, but

What if we never learn how to behave?
I did something, and you never forgave me
I never thought that it could be like this
But now I see
I see you share your cake with him
Unwrapping presents that I should have sent
What can I do?
Must I watch you?

Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles
So Happy Birthday again
And it's the same every year
Seems that I remember it as something more, but
You know how children can grow
So strange
I still adore you
What if we never learn from our mistakes?
But then, you'll never know how my heart aches
I never thought that it would be like this
But now I see
I see you share your cake with him
Unwrapping presents that I should have sent
What can I do?
Must I watch you?

Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles
So Happy Birthday again
Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles
So Happy Birthday again
One day I know he'll forget
To pay you the compliments you're after
You'll hang your sad, aching head
Behind a brittle smile or a shrill of laughter

What if we only get what we deserve?
Somehow I couldn't quite summon the nerve
Upon each anniversary
Then do you ever think of me?
Unwrapping presents that I should have sent
What can I do?
Must I watch you?
Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles, So Happy Birthday again Embed
