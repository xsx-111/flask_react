Such Unlikely Lovers Lyrics
On a hot city day
When your white shirt turns to grey
That's when she'll arrive
When you look how you feel
Someone steps upon your heel
That's when she will come
Listen now
I'm not saying that there will be violins
But don't be surprised if they appear
Playing in some doorway
Still I can't believe that this is happening

We're such unlikely lovers
Though no one seems to notice as they hurry by
Ask me what I'm thinking, and I won't deny it
Can you believe it's happening? 

There were no magic spells
You can keep the flowers and bells
They just don't seem right
Can it actually be?
Me and you and you and me
Though we're like day and night
Listen now
I'm not saying that there will be violins
But don't be surprised if they appear
Playing in some doorway
Still I can't believe that this is happening
We're such unlikely lovers
Though no one seems to notice as they hurry by
Ask me what I'm feeling, and I won't deny it
Can you believe it's happening?
I am bewildered
Can you believe it's happening?
Somebody help me
Can you believe it's happening?Embed
