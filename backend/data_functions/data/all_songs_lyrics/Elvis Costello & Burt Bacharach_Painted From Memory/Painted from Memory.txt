Painted from Memory Lyrics
Such a picture of loveliness
Didn't you notice the resemblance?
Doesn't it look like she could speak?
Those eyes I tried to capture
They are lost to me now forever
They smile for someone else

Funny, how looks can be deceiving
But she's not easily
Painted from memory

You'd think that I would know by now
Those eyes I tried to capture
They are lost to me now forever
They smile for someone else

And so this had to be
Painted from memory

She is gone, and I must accept it
She is lost to me now
But I can't look away just yet though
She smiles for someone else
And so this had to be
Painted from memory
Funny, now I can see
How looks can be deceivingEmbed
