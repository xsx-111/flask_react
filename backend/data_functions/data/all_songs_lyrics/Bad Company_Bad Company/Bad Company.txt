Bad Company Lyrics
Mmm

Company, always on the run
Destiny, mmm, is a rising sun
Oh, I was born six-gun in my hand
Behind a gun, I make my final stand, hey
It's why they call me

Bad company and I can't deny
Bad company 'til the day I die
Oh, 'til the day I die
'Til the day I die

Rebel souls, deserters we are called
Chose a gun and threw away the song
Now these towns, they all know our name
Six-gun sound is our claim to fame
I can hear them say

Bad company and I won't deny
Bad, bad company 'til the day I die
Ha, ha, oh yeah
'Til the day I die, ooh
Oh

Hey, hey, hey
Bad company, I can't deny
Bad company 'til the day I die
What'd I say now?
Is bad company
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bad company 'til the day I die
Whoa yes

Said I'm young and I'm free
Oh, but I'm-a bad company
That's the way I play, yeah
Dirty for dirty, heh
Oh, somebody double-cross me
Double-cross for double-cross
Yeah, we're bad company
Oh, the cold wind blowing, ah
Mmm yeah7Embed
