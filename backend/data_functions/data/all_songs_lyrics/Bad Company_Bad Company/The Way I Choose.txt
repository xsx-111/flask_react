The Way I Choose LyricsI live my life the way that I choose
I'm satisfied, nothing to lose
I don't ask no favors, I don't know the reason why
If I don't ask no questions, I don't get no lies
You give your love tederly
Every way that you move is closer to me
I don't need nobody to tell me the reason why
If I love only you baby, I'll be satisfied
Baby answer my question
If you won't say hello, don't say goodbye
I don't need nobody to tell me the reason why
If I love only you baby I'll be satisfied
You know I'll be satisfied
Because because because you satisfy my love
You satisfy my love
Don't say goodbye and leave me to cry
Don't say goodbye
Girl you're walking away1Embed
