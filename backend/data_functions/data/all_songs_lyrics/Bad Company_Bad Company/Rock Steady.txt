Rock Steady LyricsWell, when I want to rock steady
I know, I got to get ready
Close my eyes and I let myself go
Listen to, oh, baby, let the music flow
Turn on your light and stay with me a while
And ease your worried mind
Turn on your light, now babe
And stay with me a while and rock steady
Yeah, oh, now rock steady
Yeah, rock, rock steady now
When my love, yeah, gets a little bit too heavy
She's mine an' I got to get ready
Close my eyes and let myself go
I listen too, yeah, and I let the music flow
Yeah, it's flowing now
Turn on your light and stay with me a while
And ease your worried mind
Turn on your light
And stay with me a while and rock steady
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn on your light and stay with me a while
And ease your worried mind; turn on your light
Stay with me a while
And rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Babe, turn on your light
And ease your worried mind
Yeah, turn on your little light
Oh, and rock steadyEmbed
