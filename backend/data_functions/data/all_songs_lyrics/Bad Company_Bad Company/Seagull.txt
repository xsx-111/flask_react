Seagull LyricsSeagull, you fly across the horizon
Into the misty morning sun
Nobody asks you where you are going
Nobody knows where you're from
Here is a man asking the question
Is this really the end of the world?
Seagull, you must have known for a long time
The shape of things to come
Now you fly, through the sky, never asking why
And you fly all around 'til somebody, Shoots you down
Da da da da da da da down
Mm mm mm mm, mm mm
Seagull, you fly, across the horizon
Into the misty morning sun
Nobody asks you where you are going
Nobody knows where you are from
Now you fly through the sky, never asking why
And you fly all around 'til somebody, yeah
Shoots you down. Mm mm, yeah
Seagull you fly, seagull you fly away
And you fly away today
And you fly away tomorrow
And you fly away, leave me to
My sorrow
Mm, mm, mm
Seagull go and fly, mm, mm, mm
Fly to your tomorrow, leave me to my sorrow, flyEmbed
