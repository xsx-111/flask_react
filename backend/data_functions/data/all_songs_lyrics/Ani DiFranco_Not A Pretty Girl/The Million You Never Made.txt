The Million You Never Made LyricsThe air comes off the ocean
The city smells fishy
The air is full of fish and mystery
Whispering who, what, when
I am warning you i am weightless
And the wind is always shifting
So don't hang anything on me
If you ever want to see it again
I am telling you i'm different than you
Think i am
And you can dangle your carrot
But i ain't gonna reach for it
Cuz i need both my hands
To play my guitar
And life is a sleazy stranger
Who looks vaguely familiar
Flirting with a bimbo named disaster
At the end of the bar
And i am telling you that i am different
Than you are
At night when you're asleep
Self hatred's going to creep in
You can try to blame it on the devil
The one who's bed you sleep in
And don't tell me what they did to you
As though you had no choice
Tell me, isn't that your picture?
Isn't that your voice?
If you don't live what you sing about
Your mirror is going to find out
Oh yeah
I'd like to go to all the pretty parties
Where all the pretty people go
And i ain't really all that pretty
But nobody will know
Cuz everybody loves you
When you're a star
And nobody questions
What it takes to go that far
And life is a sleazy stranger
And this is his favorite bar
No i don't prefer obscurity
But i'm an idealistic girl
And i wouldn't work for you
No matter what you paid
And i may not be able
To change the whole fucking world
But i could be the million
That you never made
Oh yeah
I could be the million that you never made
I could be the million that you'll never make
You're looking at the million that you'll never makeEmbed
