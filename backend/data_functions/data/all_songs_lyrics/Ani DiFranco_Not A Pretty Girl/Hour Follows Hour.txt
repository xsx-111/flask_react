Hour Follows Hour LyricsHour follows hour like water follows water
Everything is governed by the rule
Of 'one thing leads to another'
You can't really place blame
'cause blame is much too messy
Someone's bound to get on you
While you were trying to put it on me
And don't fool yourself into thinking things are simple
Nobody's lying still the stories don't line up
Why do you try to hold on to what you'll never get a hold on?
You wouldn't try to put the ocean in a paper cup
'Cause I have had something to prove
As long as I know there's something that needs improvement
And you know that every time I move
I make a woman's movement
And first you decide what you've gotta do
Then you go out and do it
And maybe the most we can do
Is just to see each other through it
Hour follows hour like water in a river
And from one to the next
We don't know what each hour will deliver
We just call it like we see it
Call it out loud as we can
And then afterwards we call it all water over the dam
Maybe the moral higher ground
Ain't as high as it seems
Maybe we are both good people
Who've done some bad things
I just hope it was okay
I know it wasn't perfect
I hope in the end we can laugh
And say it was all worth it
'Cause I have had something to prove
As long as I know something that needs improvement
And you know that every time I move
I make a woman's movement
And first you decide what you've gotta do
And then you go out and do it
And maybe the most that we can do
Is just to see each other through it
We make our own gravity to give weight to things
Then things fall and they break and gravity sings
We can only hold so much is what I figure
Try and keep our eye on the big picture
Picture keeps getting bigger
And too much is how I love you
But too well is how I know you
And I've got nothing to prove this time
Just something to show you
I guess I just wanted you to see
That it was all worth it to meEmbed
