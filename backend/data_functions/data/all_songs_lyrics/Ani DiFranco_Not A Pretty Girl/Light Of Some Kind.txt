Light Of Some Kind LyricsI wish i didn't have this nervous laugh
I wish i didn't say half the stuff i say
I wish i could just learn to cover my tracks
I guess i'm not concerned about getting away
'cause every time i try to hold my tongue
It slips like a fish from a line
They say if you want to play
You should learn how to play dumb
I guess i can't bring myself to waste your time
'cause we both know what i've been doing
I've been intentionally bad at lying
You're the only boy i ever let see through me
And i hope you beleive me when i say i'm trying
And i hope i never improve my game
Yeah i'd rather have these things weighing on my mind
And at the end of this tunnel of guilt and shame
There must be a light of some kind
There must be a light of some kind
I must have blown a fuse or something
Cause it was so dark in my mind
She came up to me with the sweetest face
And she was holding a light of some kind
And i still think of you as my boyfriend
I don't think this is the end of the world
But i think maybe you should follow my example
And go meet yourself a really nice girl
'cause we both know. . 
In the end the world comes down to just a few people
But for you it comes down to one
But no one ever asked me if i thought i could be
Everything to someone
There's a crowd of people harboured in every person
There are so many roles that we play
And you've decided to love me for eternity
I'm still deciding who i want to be today
Cause we both know. . Embed
