Tiptoe LyricsTiptoeing through the used condoms
Strewn on the piers
Off the west side highway
Sunset behind
The skyline of jersey
Walking towards the water
With a fetus holding court in my gut
My body highjacked
My tits swollen and sore
The river has more colors at sunset
Than my sock drawer ever dreamed of
I could wake up screaming sometimes
But i don't
I could step off the end of this pier but i got
Shit to do
And an appointment on tuesday
To shed uninvited blood and tissue
I'll miss you i say
To the river to the water
To the son or daughter
I thought better of
I could fall in love
With jersey at sunset
But i leave the view to the rats
And tiptoe backEmbed
