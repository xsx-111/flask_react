Shy LyricsWell the heat is so great
It plays tricks with the eye
It turns the road into water
Then from water to sky
And there's a crack in the concrete floor
That starts at the sink
Yeah, there's a bathroom in the gas station
And I've locked myself in it to think
Back in the city
The sun bakes the trash on the curb
The men are pissing in doorways
And the rats are running in herds
And I've got a dream with your face in it
That scares me awake
I've put too much on my table
Now I've got too much at stake
And I might let you off easy
Yea I might lead you on
I might wait for you to look for me
And then I might be gone
There's where I've come from and where I'm going
And I am lost in between
I might go out to that phone booth
And leave a veiled invitation on your machine
And you'll stop me, won't you?
If you've heard this one before
Oh the one where I surprise you
By showing up at your front door
Saying, "Let's not ask what next
Or how or why
I'm leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy"
Don't be shy
The door opens, the room winces
The housekeeper comes in without a warning
And I squint at the muscular motel light
And say "Hey good morning"
As she jumps her keys jingle
She leaves as quickly as she came in
And I roll over and taste the pillow with my grin
Well the sheets are twisted and damp
Oh the heat is so great
And I swear I can feel the mattress
Sinking underneath your weight
Oh yeah sleep is like a fever
And I'm glad when it ends
Oh the road flows like a river
And it pulls me round every bend
Stop me, won't you?
If you've heard this one before
Oh the one where I surprise you
By showing up at your front door
Saying, "Let's not ask what next
Or how or why
I am leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy"
Don't be shy
Well the heat is so great
It plays tricks with the eye
It turns the road into water
Then from water to sky
And there's a crack in the concrete floor
It starts at the sink
There's a bathroom in the gas station
And I have locked myself in it to think
And you'll stop me, won't you?
If you've heard this one before
Yeah the one where I surprise you
By showing up at your front door
Saying, "Let's not ask what next
Or how or why
I am leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy"
You'll stop me, won't you?
If you've heard this one before
Yeah the one where I surprise you
By showing up at your front door
Saying, "Let's not ask what next
How or why
I'm leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy"
Don't be shy
No dont be shy
No don't be shy
No don't be shy
Come on fucker don't be shyEmbed
