Worthy LyricsYou think you're not worthy
I'd have to say i agree
I'm not worthy of you
You're not worthy of me
Which of us is deserving
Look at the human race
The whole planet at arm's length
And we don't deserve this place
What good is a poker face
When you've got an open hand
I was supposed to be cool about this
Yeah i remember cool was the plan
Tried to keep it all under wraps
But the wraps kept going slack
I keep turning around
I keep coming back
Give me your vertical
Your horizontal line
I want to take each of them
Bend them to fit mine
The world is too good for me
I am such a naughty girl
But when we're together
We're too good for this world
You think you're not worthy
I'd have to say i agree
I'm not worthy of you
You're not worthy of me
I'm not worthy of you
You aren't worthy of me...Embed
