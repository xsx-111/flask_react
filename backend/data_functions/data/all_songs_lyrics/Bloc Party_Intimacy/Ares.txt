Ares Lyrics
War, war, war, war
I want to declare a war
My fist breaks your porcelain nose
There are other things my hands can do
To create or to destroy
Mini gods and goddesses
First person singular
Set it, set it, set it off
War, war, war, war
Keep the past, the future is ours
Man-made natural disaster
Blocking out all of the sun
Superman and mitsi turbo
Speed, agility, super strength
Wipe the blood off those knuckles
Spark it, give me twos on that

War, war, war, war
I want to declare a war
True say blud that when we ride
We don't stop for nobody
The Africans and the Bengalis
He knows all the rudeboys
Reebok, Nike, Adidas, Puma
"Rer, rer, rer, this shit is long"
It's all getting
(It's all getting)
Quite highly charged
(Quite highly charged)
Get out of the way
(Get out of the way)
Or get fucked up
(Or get fucked up)
We dance to the sound of sirens
We dance to the sound of sirens
We dance to the sound of sirens
We dance to the sound

And to think that these hands
Could work wonders with their touch
Listening to dead singers
In your room in '98

We dance to the sound of sirens
We dance to the sound of sirens
We dance to the sound of sirens
We dance to the sound
We dance to the sound
We dance to the sound
We dance to the sound
We dance to the soundEmbed
