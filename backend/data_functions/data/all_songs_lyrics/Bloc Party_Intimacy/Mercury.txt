Mercury Lyrics
My Mercury's in retrograde
My Mercury's in retrograde
Mer- Mer- Mercury's in retrograde
My Mercury's in retrograde

Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury, Mer- Mer- Mercury's in
Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde

This is not the time, the time to start a new love
This is not the time, the time to sign a lease
Try not to worry about what's forgotten
Try not to worry about what's been missed

Scars on my shins and scars on my knuckles
Today I woke up in a basketball court
Jonjo's in Sydney and he ain't returning
I'm sitting in Soho, tryna stay drunk

In any bar in the world
From Silverlake to Williamsburg
You could pick another stranger
And fall in love
Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde
Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde

This is not the time, the time to start a new love
This is not the time, the time to sign a lease
Try not to worry about what's forgotten
Try not to worry about what's been missed

Bleeding gums and v- veins protruding
I'm starting to hate all of your clothes
Neumayr's in LA and she ain't returning
I'm sleeping with people I don't even like

In any bar in the world
From Silverlake to Williamsburg
You could pick another stranger
And fall in love

Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde
Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde
Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde
Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde
When I saw you last night, I wanted to say
Run away with me, away from the cynics
That this could be the start of something truly real
But all that I could say was, "Hey"
Was, "Hey," was, "Hey," was, "Hey"

Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde
Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde
Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde
Mercury, Mercu- Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde

Mercury's in retrograde
My mercury's in retrograde
Mer- Mer- Mercury's in retrograde
My Mercury's in retrogradeEmbed
