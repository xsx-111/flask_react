Talons Lyrics
And in the dark it comes for me
Malevolent and without form
Uprooting trees, destroying cars
Cold and relentless with arms outstretched
No bolt nor brick nor crucifix
Can hold it back
I have been wicked
I have been arrogant

And when it comes it will feel like a kiss, silent about it
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
And I cannot say that I was not warned or was misled
When it comes it will feel like a kiss

Awaken from dreams of drunken car crashes
You've saddened my friends and claimed all my lovers
I try to stand still so it will not see me
Its talons rake the side of my face
Oh, when did you become such a slut?

And when it comes it will feel like a kiss, silent about it
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
And I cannot say that I was not warned or was misled
When it comes it will feel like a kiss
And I did not think I'd catch fire
When I held my hand to the flame
And I didn't think it would catch up
As fast as I could have run
Fate came a-knocking
When I was looking the other way
A new disease came in the post
For me today

And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
And when it comes
And when it comes
And when it comes
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss3Embed
