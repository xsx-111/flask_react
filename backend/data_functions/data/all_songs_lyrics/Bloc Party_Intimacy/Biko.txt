Biko Lyrics
(You're not doing this alone)
(You're not doing, you're not doing this alone)

For my sweetheart, the melancholic
You have crossed the River Styx
And the waves have taken you away
As I lay my head on your chest
I can hear it in your veins
Wake me up when you come to bed

So toughen up
Biko toughen up
Biko toughen up
This world isn't kind to little things
(You're not doing this alone)

Was my love not strong enough to
Bring you back from the dead?
If i could eat your cancer I would
But I can't (You're not doing this alone)
So I keep writing these songs for you
To steal you from your grave
We can dance in our front room again
So toughen up
Biko toughen up
Biko toughen up
I need you to be strong for us
So toughen up
Biko toughen up
Biko toughen up
This world isn't kind to little things
(You're not doing this alone)

Don't you know that when you stand
You stand up for the both of us?
Remember that when the darkness looms
(You're not doing this alone)
Every tear you shed is cleansing
Taking the pain away from you
I left you blueberries in the fridge
The little things that I can do
(So toughen up) (I can do)
(Biko toughen up) (That I can do)
(Biko toughen up) (That I can do)
I need you to be strong for us

So toughen up
Biko toughen up
Biko toughen up
This world isn't kind to little things
(You're not doing this alone)
Resist, resist
Resist, resist
So toughen up
(Resist)
Biko, toughen up
(Resist)
Biko, toughen up
(Resist)
I need you to be strong for us
So toughen up
(Resist)
Biko, toughen up
(Resist)
Biko, toughen up
(Resist)
This world isn't kind to little things
(You're not doing this alone)2Embed
