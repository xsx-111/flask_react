Your Visits Are Getting Shorter Lyrics

I can see it in your eyes now
You have come to resent me
Condescension
In the silence
Your fingers are tired, girl
How they falter against my thigh
Your kisses are pining
For the lips of someone else

Your visits getting shorter
Your heart is getting further from me
Your touch is getting colder
Always somewhere you need to be

Boys in blue blazers
Boys on motorbikes
Boys in your math class
Who'll do anything you ask

You're pulling the trigger
And the gun is in my mouth
A subtle annoyance
Laced with disgust
When you get older
And those boys grow tired of you
You can come find me
I can never hate you
Your visits getting shorter
Your heart is getting further from me
Your touch is getting colder
Always somewhere you need to be

Boys on your left side
Boys on your right
Boys by your locker
Who'll do anything you ask

Let's spend the whole day in bed then
'Cause if we don't, you'll want to
Want to leave
I try to hold something I can
I try to hold something I can
Never keep

Your visits getting shorter
Your heart is getting further from me
Your touch is getting colder
Always somewhere you need to be
Boys on your left side
Boys on your right
Boys by your locker
Who'll do anything you ask
