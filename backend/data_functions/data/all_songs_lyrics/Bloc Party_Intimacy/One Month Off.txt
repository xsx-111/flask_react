One Month Off Lyrics
Well, there were seven years between us
Seems that all my friends were right
That we can't survive on your bedroom eyes
And a Spanish guitar
When we started this it was paradise
Not just Bethnal Green
And it's just not right this waiting game
Making a cuckold of me

I can be as cruel as you
Fighting fire with firewood
I can be as cruel as you
Fighting lies with lies
(If you need time)

And it's just not like me to lash out
But enough is enough
Tell me what the others can do
That I can't
Translucent and sun-bleached skin, yeah
When did you get so LA?
How can you desert me after
What we've been through?
Stuck on a dream that somewhere it's better
You'll be the one missing out

I can be as cruel as you
Fighting fire with firewood
I can be as cruel as you
Fighting lies with lies
(If you need time)
I can be as cruel as you
Fighting fire with firewood (if you need time)
I can be as cruel as you
Fighting lies with lies

If you need time, time, time
Time, time, time

I can be as cruel as you
Fighting fire with firewood
I can be as cruel as you
Fighting lies with lies
(If you need time)
I can be as cruel as you
Fighting fire with firewood (if you need time)
I can be as cruel as you
Fighting lies with lies
I can be as cruel as you
Fighting fire with firewood
I can be as cruel as you
Fighting lies with lies
Fighting lies with lies, with lies, with lies
Fire with, fire, fire with, firewood, wood
Lies, lies, lies, lies1Embed
