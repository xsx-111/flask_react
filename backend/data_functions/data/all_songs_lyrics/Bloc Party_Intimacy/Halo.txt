Halo Lyrics
It was your hair that did it
It was your hair that lit the fuse
A golden brown halo
Like sunlight peering through trees
I ask you for the time
But I am asking for so much more
A moth to your lightbulb
You made my heart beat faster

Paralyse me with your kiss
Wipe those dirty hands on me
Maybe we're looking for the same thing
Maybe you're the one who will complete me

Oh how beauty burns
Lips and eyes and fingertips
The spark of desire
On every point our bodies meet
Behind your eyes were stars
Infinite and serene
How I could suffer for you
You fascinate and magnetize me
Paralyse me with your kiss
Wipe those dirty hands on me
Maybe we're looking for the same thing
Maybe you're the one who will complete me

Sometimes I think
I would float away
If this sadness
Didn't weigh me down

Paralyse me with your kiss
Wipe those dirty hands on me
Maybe we're looking for the same thing
Maybe you're the one who will complete me2Embed
