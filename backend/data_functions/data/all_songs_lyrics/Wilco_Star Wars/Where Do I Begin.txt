Where Do I Begin Lyrics
Alright
At least you cried
A point of pride
Has torn in two
What was we
Where we meets you
From where we end
To where do I begin

We're so alone
We're never alone
Forever in debt
To the stomach I get
When things can't be known
Our paths overgrown
From where we end
To where do I begin

Why can't we tell
When we're in hell?
Why can't I say something
To make you well?
When things can't be seen
Confined within the dream
From where we end
To where do I begin
From what was left behind
To you're my friend
I won't ever, ever, ever
Fall apart like that again
From where we are
To where do I beginEmbed
