Taste the Ceiling LyricsI was only asking for a moment of the truth
I can't fight the feeling when I'm hanging out with you
Why do I forgive you, because I get confused
I could never leave behind the part of me that you refuse
I was on the ceiling, I could almost feel the sun
Try the words in sequence but that's never how it's done
Why do our disasters creep so slowly into view
I was only after a friend to follow through
I couldn't lose
I know why you don't really know me
I don't think you can call it home
All alone I couldn't taste another thing
I was on the ceiling and I swore it might be true
I could fight the feeling but not quite as well as you
I don't know, won't you come and show me
I don't think it's what you did before
All alone I couldn't take a case like you1Embed
