King of You Lyrics
Wave after wave
Wishes unspoken
Talks like a blowtorch
Palms out and frozen

Who said it's easy?
Language is losing
I swallow the steam
And claim to be stupid

Nails on the threshold
Moon free, don't make me the king of you

Past is a point
Behind the horizon
Bottom of the flame
Burning the garden

Smiling on the threshold
Moon free, don't make me the king of you
Well, I'm a soldier for you frightened
Climbing, don't make me the king of you
Wave after wishes
My boon companion
Talks to the frost
But who will cheer the champion?Embed
