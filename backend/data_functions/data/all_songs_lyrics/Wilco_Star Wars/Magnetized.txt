Magnetized Lyrics
Orchestrate the shallow pink refrigerator drone
Carried in the shadows almost bone
Everyone wastes my time

The moment that you thought would murder motions you wait
Every apprehension alien, ache, ah
Everyone wastes my time

Everybody goes
I'm, I'm lonely

I sleep underneath
A picture that I keep of you next to me
I realize we're magnetized

Orchestrate the shallow pink refrigerator drone
Carried in the shadows, ah
Everyone wastes my time

I sleep underneath
A picture that I keep of you next to me
I realize we're magnetized
I realize we're magnetized
Realize we're magnetized
Realize we're magnetized5Embed
