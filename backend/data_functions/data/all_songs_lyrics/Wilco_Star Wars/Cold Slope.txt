Cold Slope LyricsSo-so and you don't really care
Stand alone and you're there all day
Some would say you're never really there
Although you still take up space
I know I know and you know that I know
It's a power play
I, I won't recognize you
I won't recognize you
Anymore
So-so and you don't really care
Stand alone and you're there all day
Some would say you're never really there
Although you still take up space
I know I know and you know that I know
It's a power play
And I won't, atone take some wild bile wicked
Entrees over chant-lace fade
I'm on a cold scope, raking down
Where's our receiver?
Oh, look on the phone
And you can say what you want
Or I'll say what you want
Why turn the tape, undertake a weak wall
Summon the stone
I advocate aiming for the weak wall
Summon the stone
And you can say what you want
But you don't know what you want
I'll say what you want
Now I'll say
All I will say
I, I won't recognize you
I won't recognize you
