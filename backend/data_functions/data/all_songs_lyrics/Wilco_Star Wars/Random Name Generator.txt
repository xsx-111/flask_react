Random Name Generator LyricsCome on, listen to the weed whistle way
I belong to the stars in the day
I ran away eternal instigator
I was old
I remember the Milky Way, why?
I belong to the stars in the sky

Random name generator
You don't know me cold as night
Somebody hold me in the diamond light
Narrator
Mr. Narrator
I want to name every new born child
A miracle only ever grows wild
Invisible

Random name generator
I kinda like it when I make you cry
A miracle only once in a while
A random name
Random name generator
I change my name every once in a while
A miracle every once in a while
I create
I am the flame, a flame creator
A random name generator
Come on, cuff me to the weed whistle whine
If I miss your breeze will you miss mine
I kinda like it when I make you cry
A miracle every once in a while
Come on, cuff me to the weed whistle whine
I think I miss my family fineEmbed
