You Satellite LyricsSomehow
A satellite
Can of light
It's so red
Unbottle the halo, a satellite
Can chains change any failure
When all along
Someone can change it, follow on
Sometimes, I don't hate it lately
What I don't know I'm gonna bleed it away
Reunite
The dynamite
I'll catch it all and reunite
Dynamite, oh how high
I'm more moved by the maybe, it's ok
But you can't sing what you can't give away
I've come all this way to hold your hand
I became a calendar while I was waiting
I, I won't live any what you can't give it away
I, I won't miss any what I'm giving away
Don't wanna go and I don't wanna stay
You satellite
You satellite
You satelliteEmbed
