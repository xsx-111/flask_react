Pickled Ginger LyricsAlone in the zone of the sad
Where no one gives a zig to the zag
I never let you rot
I'll never bet you don't know
Some might glisten the knot
I'll never let it show
Know when I'm towin' the drag
Where no one gives a zig to the zag
Oh
I might have to let you rot
I'm sad to let you go
I can't remember the night
I know what I'll never know
No one tells me how to behave
I'm mowing and I'm growing the grave
No one tells me how to be saved
I'm growing 'til I go to my grave
I
I'll never let you rot
I'll never bet you don't know
Some might glisten the knot
I'll never let it show
I'll going to let it rot
You'll never guess what's below
Some might glisten the knot
I'll never let it showEmbed
