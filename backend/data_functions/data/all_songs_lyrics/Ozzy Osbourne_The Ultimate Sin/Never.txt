Never Lyrics
It is the voice of your laughter that echoes in vain
In the vessel of your sorrow and pain
It is the beat of a heart that you hear in your mind
Something's missing, but you cannot explain
You've searched your soul for feeling
Over and over now, over and over now
There is no use in dreaming
Over and over now, over and over now
It is the chain that you're dragging that was once your relief
That's like everything that's born to die
And the birth of a doubt that was once your belief
Is drowning in the tears that you cry
It all remains a mystery
Forever and ever now, ever and ever now
The things that were are history
Forever and ever now, ever and never now

It's never too late to cry
It's never too late for goodbyes
It's never too late to cry
You know you were born to die
Oh, God

If the Messiah is coming, will he be too late
To reconcile our tears with our hate?
And the memory of freedom that imprisons our heart
As we're greeted by the cold hand of fate
It's never too late to cry
It's never too late for goodbyes
It's never too late to cry
You know you were born to dieEmbed
