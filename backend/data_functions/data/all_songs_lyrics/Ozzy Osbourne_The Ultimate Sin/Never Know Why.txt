Never Know Why Lyrics
If we're offensive and pose a threat
You fear what we represent is a mess
You've missed the message that says it all
And you'll never know why
Oh no, you'll never know why
We rock
It's just a feeling how we excite
You cannot rule everybody in sight
But you condemn, don't understand
And you'll never know why
Oh no, you'll never know why

We rock, rock, rock 
You'll never know why
We rock

I leave you cold and in disgust
Don't try to tame me, you'll eat my dust
I know that you know not what you do
That's why you'll never know why
Oh no, you'll never know why

We rock, rock, rock 
You'll never know why
We rock, rock, rock 
You'll never know why
We rockEmbed
