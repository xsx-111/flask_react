Lightning Strikes Lyrics
Won't you listen because I'm at it again
Lightning striking, and on that you can depend
They say that lightning never strikes the same place twice
Gods of thunder, sit and watch the event
You know I take no prisoners
My back's to the wall
You know I must be going
When destiny calls
Until I feel that thunder shattering my brain

I won't stop rocking all night, rocking all night
Until the lightning strikes again
Rocking all night, rocking all night
Until the lightning strikes again

Tell your mama that you're going to be late
But not to worry, we'll just be rocking all night
The lightning strikes before you hear the thunder roar
We're becoming the children of the night
I'm not apologizing
I am what I am
There is no compromising
I don't give a damn
Until I feel the thunder boiling in my veins

Oh no, I've lost control
Here we go, it's only rock & roll
The silver light is flashing
As all turns to gold
In my head voices screaming
And I'm being told
If you will only listen, you will hear them too
