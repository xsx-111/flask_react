Fool Like You Lyrics
I hear you breathing though you're so far away
Can you just go where you're going to?
I couldn't give a damn or two about a fool like you
That's true
Are you just too cool? No, you're just perfectly cold
And what goes around still comes around
I think it's all summed up and down in a fool like you
That's true

Today is just another day
You hold your ticket into nowhere
It's up to you if you'll stay
And turn your day into a nightmare

You think you know it, you think you know it all
But you don't even have a clue
And control is still in view for a fool like you
That's true
Is there a reason for the way that you are
Or does it just come naturally?
To have an idiosyncrasy and be a fool like you
That's true
You're hearing what you want to hear
Misunderstanding all you see
An attitude in all of us
Is it really you and me

He's hiding, residing deep within the crowd
A hand out, he'll pull you down
You've been found guilty, committed every crime
But still they say you must go free
Looks like haunted I will be by a fool like you
That's true
By a fool like you 
Looks like haunted I will be by a fool like you
That's true
By a fool like you, 
Looks like haunted I will be by a fool like you
That's trueEmbed
