Killer of Giants Lyrics
If none of us believe in war
Then can you tell me what the weapon's for?
Listen to me everyone
If the button is pushed there'll be nowhere to run
Giants, sleeping giants
Winning wars within their dreams
Until they wake when it's too late
And in God's name blaspheme

Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Marches of protest not stopping the war
Or the killer of giants
The killer of giants

Mother Nature, people state your case without its worth
Your seas run dry, your sleepless eyes are turning red alert

Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Rising so proudly, it has nowhere to fall
This killer of giants
This killer of giants, yeah
Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Marches of protest not stopping the war
Or the killer of giants
Oh, the killer of giants
Killer of giants Embed
