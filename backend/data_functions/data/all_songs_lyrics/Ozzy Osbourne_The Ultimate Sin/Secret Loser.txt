Secret Loser Lyrics
Trapped in a lonely body
I'm losing control
Can't show my emotions
And I'm losing my soul
Could it be that I'm obsessed
With feeding my disease?
I couldn't make it known
The hidden things that no one sees

Yeah, loser
I'm a secret loser
Loser
I'm a secret loser

Fighting a losing battle
Pretending to win
Repenting to holy unknowns
Pretending to sin
All I do is hide the wounds
Where blood just won't congeal
Couldn't ever take my soul
Because isn't there to steal
Yeah, loser
I'm a secret loser
Loser
I'm a secret loser, now

Though I'm the loser, there is no winner
There's nothing left to win
The hidden reasons now in deletion
Are lost in sin
So heed my warning, the time is dawning
I'll tell you, here's the twist
The truth is lying, below the surface
I don't exist

Loser
I'm a secret loser
Loser
I'm a secret loser, now

Seeing is not believing
It don't mean a thing
Although it appears to be that
The loser is king
I can understand that what you see
You think is real
But underneath the surface
Is a wound that cannot heal
Yeah, loser
I'm a secret loser, Loser 
I'm a secret loserEmbed
