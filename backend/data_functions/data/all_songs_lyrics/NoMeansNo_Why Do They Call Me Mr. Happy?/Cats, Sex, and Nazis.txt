Cats, Sex, and Nazis Lyrics
Lies  can often give you power
(Okay, here we go!)
We care a lot! (That's a lie!)
We care a lot! (That's a liar!)

I spy with my lizard eye
And everything I see is a lie
You know when I told you that I would never lie?
Well, that was the first time (wrong)
Take all the pleasures that you seek
May your heart be full and still be bleak
Cold and alone, hard as stone
Like a fuck when there is no one home
Beauty and fame are meaningless, besides
The ability to kill with a look in your eye
But I defy you to see through me
Nothing is all that you will see

Cats, sex, and Nazis
That's why they call me Mr. Happy
Are you a believer? Well, I'm the deceiver
But I lied when I said that honesty was dead
I really believe all the things I say to you
It's just that none of them are true
Zombies eat human flesh
Which part do you like the best?
I like the heart the best
Zombies eat human flesh

Alright! (Take the best, leave the rest!)
If I haven't done all that I could do to hurt you
It's because my love is true
Or because my feelings are a lie
And we live just to suffer and die
I'll put a guarantee on all the beauty that I see
The fairest, the best, the first of the blessed
All those whose souls are the ugliest
Hopelessly lost in their apt bitterness (ah fuck you)
Love me and you shall be free
To join my eternal captivity
Just don't ask me if I believe all this bull
My head is empty but my bowels are full
I don't really think this way
I did yesterday, but not today

Cats, sex, and Nazis
That's why they call me Mr. Happy
Are you a believer? Well, I'm the deceiver
But I lied when I said that honesty was dead
I really believe all the things I say to you
It's just that none of them are true
Zombies eat human flesh
Which part do you like the best?
I like the heart the best
Zombies eat human flesh

I spy with my lizard eye
And everything I say is a lie
What about you? What will you do
When the sound of my voice touches you?
When you hear me say this is true
And the sound of voice touches you
This is true, this is true
The sound of my voice touches you
This is true, this is true
The sound of my voice touches you
This is true, this is true
This is true, this is true

Cats, sex, and Nazis
That's why they call me Mr. Happy
Why do I keep saying this over and over all the time?
Because it rhymes, moron!
What do you wanna hear now, a love song?
Are you in love?
Is it politically correct
Or are you just another fucking reject?
Are you getting all of this?
Are you getting all of this?
Are you getting all of this?
Or is there something you have missed?
Zombies eat human flesh
Which part do you like the best?
I like the heart the best
Zombies eat human flesh
Zombies eat human flesh
Which part do you like the best?
I like the heart the best
Zombies eat human flesh

Do you know why they call me Mr. Happy?
(No. No.)
Has anyone heard a rumor, seen something on the TV
Maybe 60 Minutes, Dan Rather mentioned it I think one time -
As to why they call me Mr. Happy?
(I must have missed it...)
(No)
(...but I've come to work and I brrrought my lunch.)
You mean no one has a clue?
No one knows the reason behind my appellation of Mr. Happy?
(No, not around here)
(I don't think so Rob!)
Well, I'll tell you
(Okay! Okay! Oka-oka-okay!)
It's because I'm so fucking smart
(Ha ha ha ha!)
(Oh, is this on? Is this on? What? What? Is this on?)Embed
