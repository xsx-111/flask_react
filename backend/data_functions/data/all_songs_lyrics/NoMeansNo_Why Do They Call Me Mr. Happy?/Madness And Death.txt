Madness And Death LyricsThere are no words that can describe
The joy I feel just in being alive
And when I look inside of me I see
Love, faith and fidelity
Within the dark night of the soul
There lies a hidden, warming glow
And if that glow were blue and white
Could you sleep dreamless through the night?
But if that glow were red and black
Would you want your money back?
It's hard enough, hard enough
Just to survive, just to be alive
It's hard enough, hard enough
Just to survive, just to be alive
Madness, madness, madness and death
Madness, madness, madness and death
Madness, madness, madness and death
Madness, madness, madness and death
Respect! Humility! Respect!
Madness and death, madness and death
Respect! Humility! Respect!
Madness and death, madness and death
All you see and all you know
Hangs from a stick before your nose
The bread of life, all that you wish
Is lying at your fingertips
If all you see is what you want
And what you see is what you get
Then cease your searching, low and high
Listen to my whispered lies
Ask for nothing
Close your eyes
It's hard enough, hard enough
Just to survive, just to be alive
It's hard enough, hard enough
Just to survive, just to be alive
SURPRISE!
Madness, madness, madness and death
Madness, madness, madness and death
Madness, madness, madness and death
Madness, madness, madness and death
Respect! Humility! Respect!
Madness and death, madness and death
Respect! Humility! Respect!
Madness and death, madness and deathEmbed
