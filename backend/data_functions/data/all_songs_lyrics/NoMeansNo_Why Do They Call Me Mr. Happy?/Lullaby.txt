Lullaby LyricsLet the bells ring out, let the bells ring out
The hero is dead and the children are in bed
Let the bells ring out
Let the bells ring out, let the bells ring out
The hero is dead and the children are in bed
Let the bells ring out
All around, people in the town, they be dancing in the street
Young and old, the lame and the whole, they be dancing in the street
Everybody be moving, everybody get high
Everybody be moving, everybody get high
All around, people in the town, they be dancing in the street
Young and old, the lame and the whole, they be dancing in the street
Everybody be moving, everybody get high
Everybody be moving, everybody get high
Let the bells ring out, let the bells ring out
The hero is dead and the children are in bed
Let the bells ring out
All around, people in the town, they be dancing in the streetEmbed
