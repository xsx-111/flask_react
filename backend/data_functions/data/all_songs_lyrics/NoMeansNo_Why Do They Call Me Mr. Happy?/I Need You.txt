I Need You LyricsI want to come home now
I've been away too long
I want to come back
I'm too sick at heart and scared to go on
I can't pretend any more
To you I can't pretend
I need a friend
I can't be alone any more
I need you, I need you now
I need you, I need you now
Cut off, apart, isolated
In my pride, in my hatred
My face is sad and afraid
Black in the sun and white in the shade
The night reflects it
In every window I pass
In every pane of glass
I can't last like this, I can't last
I need you, I need you now
I need you, I need you now
I need you now, I need you now
I need you
All those I pushed away
They walk with me, live in me now
And the silence of what I never said
Screams in my ears and pounds in my head
But when I look at you
I know I could never lie
You see all of me when I look into your eyes
I need you, I need you now
I need you, I need you now
I need you now, I need you now
I need you now
I woke up dreaming that I was
Dead beside you on the bed
I stroked my hand across your hip
And lingered with my fingertips
From beyond, from far away
Blessing where the shadows lay
I whispered what I could not say
How you took my breath away
How you took my breath away
How you took my breath away
How you took my breath away
There is no world and I am a shadow
You are no woman and I am no man
There are only eyes and arms and hands
The eyes that cut me out
The arms that hold me round
The hands that reach out to pick me up
And lift me from the ground
Go ahead, raise me from mud
Then in the light burn me down
And whether I live forever, heaven sent
Or am doomed to die, earth bound, it doesn't matter
You may let the years drip from my face
As the world turns round and round
But as long as I can breath
Can lift my voice and make a sound
In everything I am, in everything I do
I am your servant, I need you
I need you, I need you now
I need you, I need you now
I need you now, I need you now
I need you now
I need youEmbed
