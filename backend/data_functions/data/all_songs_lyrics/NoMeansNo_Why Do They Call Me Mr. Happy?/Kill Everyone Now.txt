Kill Everyone Now LyricsKill! Everyone! Now!
Here it is lonely, here where I lie
Here it is empty, here in my heart
Here there is no one, here where I am
Here it is empty, here in my heart
Here where I lie
Grab the handle! Cock the hammer!
Pull the trigger! Change the channel!
Grab the handle! Cock the hammer!
Change the channel! Pull the trigger!
Kill everyone now
Please, kill everyone now
Kill everyone now
Kill everyone now
Here it is empty, here in my heart
Here it is lonely, here where I lie
Here there is no one, no one, no one, here where I am
Here it is empty, here in my heart
Here where I lie
Grab the handle! Cock the hammer!
Pull the trigger! Change the channel!
Grab the handle! Cock the hammer!
Change the channel! Pull the trigger!
Kill everyone now
Please, kill everyone now
Kill everyone now
Kill everyone now
Kill them all!
I guess they'll be breast-feeding in space soon
Remember, a stitch in time saves precious bodily fluids
There is no future without - Plastic! Plastic! Plastic!
Chairman Mao was a great cook, he fed all of China
One billion
Two billion
Three billion
Four billion
Five billion
Six billion
Served, served, served, served
Would you like fries with that, ma'am?
How 'bout a sundae?
Kill them all, yeah!
Here it is empty, here in my heart
Here it is lonely, here where I lie
Here there is no one, no one, no one, here where I am
Here it is empty, here in my heart
Here where I lie, kill everyone now
Kill everyone now, kill everyone now
Kill everyone now
Cock the hammer, cock the hammer
Cock the hammer
Oh look, a Dunkin' DonutsEmbed
