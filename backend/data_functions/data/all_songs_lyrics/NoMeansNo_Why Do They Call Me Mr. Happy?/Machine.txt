Machine LyricsI don't like to see you cry
You're alone and I know why
I can free your life from sin
Open up and let me in
Let me, let me, let me, come in
Machine, I'm a good machine
Machine, I'm a good machine
On you I lean, I lean, I lean, I lean, I lean, on you I lean
Machine, I'm a good machine
Believe in one another
Depend on one another
Be good to one another
I am the other
I'm a good machine, yeah, yeah, yeah
Machine, I'm a good machine
I love it, believe me, you know it's true
Believe me, I know it, you love it too
I mean it, I see it, I know it's true
I see it, I know it, you love it too
When we walk and talk about it
Talk together, I feel fine
When we walk and talk about it
Talk together, walk in line
We walk together, talk about it
Talk together, I feel fine
We talk about it, walk together
Talk together, walk in line
I guess I'm alright
Oh yeah, alright, alright
You know I'm okay
Okay, alright, alright
Oh yeah, it's alright
Alright, alright, alright
I'm okay, it's alright, I feel fine
It's okay, it's alright, in fact it's mine
I'm a big machine
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Machine, I'm a good machine
Of thee I sing, I sing, I sing, I sing, I sing of thee, I sing
Machine, I'm a good machine
Believe in one another
Depend on one another
Be good to one another
I am the other
I'm a big machine
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I love it, I made it, it's what I do
You know it, you've seen it, it looks like you
Don't you just love it, it's just like you
I love it, you love it, you know it's true
When we walk and talk about it
Talk together, I feel fine
When we walk and talk about it
Talk together, walk in line
We walk together, talk about it
Talk together, I feel fine
We talk about it, walk together
Talk together, walk in line
I guess I'm alright
Oh yeah, alright, alright
You know it's okay
Okay, alright, alright
Oh yeah, I'm alright
Alright, alright, alright
I'm okay, it's alright, I feel fine
It's okay, it's alright, in fact it's mine
I'm a big machine
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Machine, I'm a good machine
On you I lean, I lean, I lean, I lean, I lean, on you I lean
Machine, I'm a good machine
Look at me and watch yourself
Everyone is someone else
When you speak the echoes chime
The voice is yours but the words are mine
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine
