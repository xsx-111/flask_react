Slowly Melting LyricsOur floating houses on molten granite
Our liquid planet, it is a home for us all
I'm firmly planted, my earth is solid
I feel a presence but there is nothing at all
I wanted something, down here is something
It's really something but there is nothing at all
Slowly melting, we're
Slowly melting, we're
Slowly melting, we're
Slowly melting
Seed to tree, earth to birth
We are surrounded, we flourish in the decay
We mark the seconds and count the hours
Cross off the days of what is slipping away
We start out loudly and go in circles
All things converging, we find an end to each day
Slowly melting, we're
Slowly melting, we're
Slowly melting, we're
Slowly melting

The sun is burning, the earth is turning
The earth is dying, it's slowly melting away
We start to finish, the fuel exhausted
And once I had it, but now it's passing away
If there is nothing, what is that presence?
I'm slowly melting, but what is slipping away?
Slowly melting, we're
Slowly melting, we're
Slowly melting, we're
Slowly meltingEmbed
