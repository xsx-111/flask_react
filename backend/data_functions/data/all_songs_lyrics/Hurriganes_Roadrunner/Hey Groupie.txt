Hey Groupie LyricsHey groupie won't you take my hand
I'll show you where heaven stand
It's just like they did on the movies a street
It's just like they did oh
When the Lily was Queen
Don't you know i can show you how
Lily took that old mans proud
She took him to a place called lsd
She took him to die
Baby can't you see
Oh Lily
Come on darling let me try
Just a little rocking while
Come on rolling in the rag
I'm rolling, i'm bowling
If your not around
Hey groupie won't you take my hand
I'll show you where heaven stand
It's just like they did on the movies a street
It's just like they did oh
When the Lily was Queen
Guitar solo
Come on darling let me try
Just a little rocking while
Come on rolling in the rag
I'm rolling, i'm bowling
If your not around
Hey groupie won't you take my hand
I'll show you where heaven stand
It's just like they did on the movies a street
It's just like they did oh
When the Lily was QueenEmbed
