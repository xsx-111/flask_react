Mister X LyricsSpoken intro: Hey guess whos come to town
It´s Mister x and he´s looking for foxes
And when he find that fox
He´s gonna have him some fun
I´m a black cat boogie lover
I´m a red hot stud
I´m a holy rolling coaster
Shaking out of my love
Got midnight shifts to work on
Got money left to burn
Got beer in my freezer
Got nothing left to learn
I´m your man
I´m the hoochie coochie toker
I´m the first in line
There ain´t no-one here to match me
I´m a lucky number nine
Got snakeskin sneakers and a mohair zoot
Big banana in my larder
Baby just feel my fruit
I´m your man
Guitar solo
I´m the honky mojo worker
I´m the man with all the jive
Foxes seem to stick around
Like bees around the hive
Thunder in my eyes
Raining in my bones
Lightning in my pocket
Baby come on ride my storm
I´m your man
I´m your man
