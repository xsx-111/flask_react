I Will Stay Lyrics(Intro)
I will stay by your side now and forever
I will always only be in love with you
Is it true when you say that you love me?
And is it true that I'm the one?
In the day we walk together
In the night I think of you
Is it true when you say that you love me?
And is it true that I'm the one?
(Solo)
I will phone your mother and ask her
If I can marry you
I will stay by your side now and forever
I will always only be in love with you
Is it true when you say that you love me?
And is it true that I'm the one?
