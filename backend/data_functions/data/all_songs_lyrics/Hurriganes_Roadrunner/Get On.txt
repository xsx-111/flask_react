Get On LyricsJust a sweet Carolina, just a rockin' little mama
Just leave my baby in old Alabama
Rockin' in the evenin' when the sun goes down
Mean guitar, that's a swingin' old town
Rockin' and a-rollin' just a little while
Ain't got no rollin', ain't got no holdin'
Get on, get on baby, get on
Get on, get on baby, get on
Well, let me be, rock and rollin' free
Well, old Alabama, just a sweet Carolina
Just a-rockin' and rollin' may leave town
Got to be a scoogie, lay on my boogie
Let me hear you say you got my hole around
Got to be a scoogie, bing bong bang
Ain't got no rollin', ain't got no holdin'
Get on, get on baby, get on
Get on, get on baby, get on
Well, let me be, rock and roll with me
Well, go go baby dancin' rock and roll
And twist and shout, you'll be rockin' the bowl
Just a little baby, she's rollin' around
Ain't got no rockin' or rollin' in town
Got to be a scoogie of the neighbourhood
Ain't got no rollin', ain't got no bowlin'
Get on, get on baby, get on
Get on, get on baby, get on
Do you rock and roll? Ain't got no moving on
Get on, get on baby, get on
Get on, get on baby, get on
Play me one more time, rocking and the roll
Get on, get on baby, get on
Get on, get on baby, get on
Just a-moving your arse, rocking and fast
Get on, get on baby, get on
Get on, get on baby, get on
Stop the music! Rocking is slowEmbed
