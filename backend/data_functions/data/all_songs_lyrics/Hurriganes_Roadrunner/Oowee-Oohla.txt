Oowee-Oohla LyricsI was walking down the streets of Boston town
A couple bad robbers came and hit me down
Oowee oohla, oh let us rock
Came a pretty girl and she held me nice
IÂ´m in seventh heaven feeling oh my,oh my
Oowee oohla , oh let us rock
I just need a baby who will take my heart
And i need a sugar
Who will never,ever,ever,ever part
Oowee oohla, oowee oohla
Oh let us rock
Guitar solo
