Tallahassee Lassie LyricsWell, she comes from Tallahassee
She's got a hi-fi chassis
Maybe looks a little sassy
But to me she's real classy
Yeah, my Tallahassee Lassie
Down in F-L-A
Well, she dances to the Drag
The Cha-cha, Rag and Mop
Stomping to the Shag
Rocks the Bunny Hop
She dances to the Rock
She dances to the Stroll
She dances to the Walk
She can rock and roll
She's my Tallahassee lassie
Yeah, my Tallahassee lassie
She's my Tallahassee lassie
Down in F-L-A
Well, she dances to the Drag
The Cha-cha, Rag and Mop
Stomping to the Shag
Rocks the Bunny Hop
She dances to the Rock
She dances to the Stroll
She dances to the Walk
She can rock and roll
She's my Tallahassee lassie
Yeah, my Tallahassee lassie
She's my Tallahassee lassie
Down in F-L-A
Come on, baby
Come on, sugar
Come on, honey
Come on, rolling
Yeah, my Tallahassee Lassie
Down in F-L-AEmbed
