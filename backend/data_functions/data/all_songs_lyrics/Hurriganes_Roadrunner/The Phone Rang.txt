The Phone Rang LyricsThe phone rang
It was Lindy Loo
She said are you alone
I said 'umm waiting for you
Cause my momma was away
And my poppa was away
And the house could be shaking
To the sweet sweet sound of rock and roll
The bell rang
I opened the door
It was the whole damn gang
I nearly fell right on the floor
Cause my momma was away
And my poppa was away
And the house could be shaking
To the sweet sweet sound of rock and roll
-Guitar solo-
The siren rang
The cops had come
We were taken away
We were just having fun
Cause my momma was away
And my poppa was away
And the house could be shaking
To the sweet sweet sound of rock and roll
Rock and roll , rock and roll
Rock and rollEmbed
