Love That Burns Lyrics
Would you love me tomorrow
Like you say you love me now
Would you love me, would you love me tomorrow
Like you say you love me now
When the flames of our flesh have stopped burning
And the fire of our love has cooled down

Too many times I've given too much
Baby, give me your love to me in return
Too many times I've given too much
Baby, give me your love in return
Give me your mind and your heart
Oh, but please don't leave me with a love that burns

And don't you use me as your fool
Baby, because my heart can't stand another lie
Woman never use me, don't use me as your fool
Baby, because my heart can't stand another lie
And if you can't love me tomorrow
Please leave me now in my room to cry1Embed
