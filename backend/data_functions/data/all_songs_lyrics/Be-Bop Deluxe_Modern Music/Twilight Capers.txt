Twilight Capers LyricsAll the white horses ran bleeding to the end
Shot through the heart by dear devoted passion
And the falling stars that never fall
But send ambassadors to call
Still call the guilty to heaven
All the wild ones keep their shades pulled down
They hid their dead eyes from the ground
They starve their souls with murder proud
Beneath the shroud, beneath the shroud
And in a corner by the door, in a picture on the wall
Hangs a man of hollow leather
I can see his broken grin
His fallen hope, his glorious sin
Bejewelled and robed in splendour
See the clouds form without sound…
Dark and swollen, torn and bound by the storm
That scream around in the heads
Of those he found beneath the ground, beneath the ground
In the grey corridors of melting ice
In the cod golden claw of autumn nights
You can find us again in paradise
We are the voice in the shadows
The curse that binding
We are the crack in the mirror
The seeker finding
We are the light in the lantern
Your blindness brought you
We are the dazzling phantoms
Of dark misfortune…Embed
