Bring Back the Spark LyricsI've been up all night
Itâ€™s been down so long
There's a fire in my heart
If you feel the same
Won't you feed my flame
You can help bring back the spark
Bring back the spark
You can bring it back
Bring back the spark
You can bring it back
You've been killing time
It's a crime sublime
I can't even see the scars
If you get away
You can save my day
You can help bring back the spark
Bring back the spark
You can bring it back
Bring back the spark
You can bring it back
There's a star in the sky in morning
I keep thinking it's some kind of warning
They say the end of the world is near
They say no-one survives but have no fear it's not this year
Has the dream begun
Nightmares in the sun
I hear voices in the dark
If you know the game
Won't you ease my pain
You can help bring back the spark
Bring back the spark
You can bring it back
Bring back the spark
You can bring it backEmbed
