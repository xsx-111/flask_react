The Gold at the End of My Rainbow LyricsThe cup of sorrow overflows…
Nothing shows, no nothing glows
But my soul is all at sea
The night has had it’s way with me
This game is growing rather grim
And some of us must sink or swim
But I’ll play the sailor brave
From the cradle to my grave
‘Cos you’re the gold at the end of my rainbow
The ghost with the silver smile
You’re the gold at the end of my rainbow
Oh, won’t you stay with me
Please won’t you stay with me
Oh, won’t you stay with me awhile
Our enemies are at the gate
Well armed with jealousy and hate
But my sword is in my hand
And I will fight at your command
The storm is raging in my head
The things I’ve done
The words I’ve said
Never change your skies to grey
For I will chase the clouds away
‘Cos you’re the gold at the end of my rainbow
The ghost with the silver smile
You’re the gold at the end of my rainbow
Oh, won’t you stay with me
Please won’t you stay with me
Oh, won’t you stay with me awhileEmbed
