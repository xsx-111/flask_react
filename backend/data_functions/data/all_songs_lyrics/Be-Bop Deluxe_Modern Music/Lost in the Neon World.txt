Lost in the Neon World LyricsThis jet-age life is getting worse
I feel I'm half a universe away
I left my home some time ago
To fight the creatures of the USA
You tell me that this neon world is free
Say this is the place I ought to be
The time has come for me to go
You say it's far too, feeling slow todayEmbed
