Autosexual LyricsAway
We go
So fast
(x3)
Feel im speedin' on
The highway's leading
Screaming like a jet tonight
Don't know what I'm after
But my wheels are going faster
Than the speed of light
Thunder screams thunder
I think I'm going under
With my streamlined thrill
Burning, I'm burning
Got a psycho desperate German
Making fastest kill (Oh yeah)
Away
We go
So fast
