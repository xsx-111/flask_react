Forbidden Lovers LyricsForbidden lovers
We hid our hearts beneath the stars
Under the covers
In midnight rooms and shining cars
I'm glad they came
To taste your pain
We're both insane on this crazy night
Such a crazy night
Forbidden lovers
A secret message on the phone
Heaven's above us
And hell's below, so I am told
Beware the shame
And paper game
It's all the same when you sell your soul
To a love so bold
Oh will you be my secret lover?
My tragic romance in the rain?
And we will sail thee off together
For you can help me clear my fame
Wake up in a strange bed
Pearly whites and cloud web
Photograph my wild head
Shoot me to the stars
Shoot me to the stars
Forbidden lovers
We walk in silence through the void
There are no others
For only darkness knows the choice
At your command
An all night stand
A pleasure grand and a deep delight
Forbidden lovers
We cruise the highways of desire
Represents fathers
Above you heads and climbing higher
We touch the sky
With wings so wide
And angels hide on the demon's shore
On the demon's shore
Oh will you be my secret lover?
My tragic romance in the rain?
And we will sail thee off together
For you can help me clear my fame
Wake up in a strange bed
Pearly whites and cloud wed
Photograph my wild head
Shoot me to the stars
Shoot me to the starsEmbed
