Modern Music (Reprise) LyricsModern music on my radio
Another station and another show
If only I could let my feelings flow
When you're lonely and you're far away
When those steel guitars begin to play
Please don't let them steal your heart away
From me
Please don't let them steal your heart away from me
Please don't let them steal your heart awayEmbed
