Down on Terminal Street LyricsI took a walk down terminal street last night
To see the ancient faces living there
I saw the sunken eyes of agony
And saw the desperate stations of despair
The madman waiting for the spirit girls to come
In a song well written but unsung
I saw the smiling wardens cracking down the noose
In which my drowning head was hung
Oh, down on terminal street
Oh, down on terminal street
The street cafe was closed to all but ghosts
Who glide the alleys searching for their lair
I heard a voice like winter call my name
Said very soon that I would join them there
And all the creatures born of ink and rage and lies
Crawled off my pan and ran across the page to die
Fascination was the germ of their disease
Degradation is the term of their release
Oh, down on terminal street
Oh, down on terminal street
Oh yes, I'm down on terminal street tonight
Oh no, not down on terminal street tonight
Oh yes, down on terminal street tonight
Oh no, down on terminal street tonight
Oh yes, I'm down on terminal street tonight
Terminal street!Embed
