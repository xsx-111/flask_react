Dancing in the Moonlight (All Alone) LyricsBurning, my love for you is burning
Yearning, for the day when I'm returning
All alone, I wonder if you're all alone
Moonlight, you're dancing in the moonlight
All night, I need to hold you all night
All alone, I wonder if you're all alone
When will this journey be through?
I'd like to make love to you (to you)
Moonlight, you're dancing in the moonlight
All night, I need to hold you all night
All alone, I wonder if you're all alone
All alone, I wonder if you're all alone
All alone, I wonder if you're all aloneEmbed
