Honeymoon on Mars LyricsI wonder if you're all alone
Beneath those diamond stars
Honeymoon on Mars
Tonight this desert world is ours
I'll meet you by the towers
For cocktails in the bar
Out in Hollywood
We're going out there in July
Out in Hollywood
We'll watch the plastic shell roll by
It's just a flash across the sky (x3)Embed
