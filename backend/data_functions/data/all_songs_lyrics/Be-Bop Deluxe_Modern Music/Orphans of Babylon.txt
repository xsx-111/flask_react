Orphans of Babylon LyricsOoh in Babylon
Your secret's on the run
We're hiding from the sun, tonight
My mind has been set free
I dream of sorcery
Bring all your sins to me, tonight
The airships cross the sky in sight of you
They fly their message high to read the daily news
Nothing here for certain
Nothing is the truth
Hid behind the curtain
We'll rob you of your youth?
Draw on the video
We'll watch the naked show?
It's all the rage you know, tonight
Kiss me and load my gun?
Go put your nylons on
I'll have you, everyone, tonight
The airships cross the sky in sight of you
I'll shoot them as they fly, there's nothing else to do
Nothing here for certain
Nothing is the truth
Leave behind the curtain
Rob you of your youth
Orphans of Babylon
We are the chosen ones
We'll do what no one's done tonight
So kiss the truth goodbye
We'll climb upon your lies
We've got no alibis tonight (x4)
Tonight
Tonight
