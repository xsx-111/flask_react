Kiss of Light LyricsThe woman of moon flew into my room last night
She tortured my body and made me feel sorry
Though I though I was right
Gave me the kiss of light … Gave me the kiss of light …
Gave me the kiss of light … Gave me the kiss of
Light my candle, hold my hand
I’m grinning like a fool
Spread your love around my head
I’m feeling rather cruel
Alone in the dance hall we spoke of her next incarnation…
I asked what it took and she gave me a look
Needing no explanation
Gave me the kiss of light … Gave me the kiss of light …
Gave me the kiss of light … Gave me the kiss of
Lightning flashing, thunder crashing
Love is such a thrill
Re-arrange my holidays and move in for the kill
She gives me the kiss on light
And all my mirrors are windows
She gives me the kiss of light
And I don’t know where the time goes
I’m down on my knees, it’s easy to see how everything has its’ place…
And mine is to be her taste of the sea this morning…
We walked through the towers, the sky fell in showers
We caused a sensation
The future was changed as we stood in the rain
At the back of the station…
Gave me the kiss of light …
Gave me the kiss of light …
Gave me the kiss of light …
Gave me the kiss of light …Embed
