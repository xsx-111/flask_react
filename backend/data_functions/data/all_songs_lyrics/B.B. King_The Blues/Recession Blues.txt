Recession Blues LyricsSince this recession I'm losing my baby
Because the times are getting so hard
Yes, since this recession I'm losing my baby
Because the times are getting so hard
Yes, I have to stop running around
Man, you know it's breaking my heart
Yes, I can't afford no liquor
All I can buy is beer and wine
Yes, I can't afford no liquor people
All I can buy is beer and wine
Well I can get my baby what she wants
And she stays cross al the time, yes help me
Yes, please somebody
Please go out to Washington for me
Yes, please, please somebody
Please go out to Washington for me
Yes, think about us out here
Help me get out of this miseryEmbed
