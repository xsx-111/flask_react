Five Seconds Lyrics
Strolling through the slaughterhouse of love
Rags and ruins and stars above
I'm as naked as I can be in this life
This labyrinth is only one straight line
Back and forth, up and down your spine
Emptiness of heaven in your ears and my eyes

One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five seconds to live
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five is all I can give
One one thousand - Two one thousand - Three one thousand
Four and five seconds again
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds - Four seconds - Five seconds
Here we go!

You are the air that I breathe!

Sweet annihilation in your hands
Your own personal Stalingrad
I'm just a piece of archaeology in your mind
I'll be your private amusement park
Rollercoasterin' in the dark
Come and turn this nightmare upside down and let's ride
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five seconds to live
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five is all I can give
One one thousand - Two one thousand - Three one thousand
Four and five seconds again
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds - Four seconds - Five seconds
Here we go!

You are the air that I breathe!
You are the air that I breathe!
You are the air that I breathe!
(Don't pull my nerve!)
You are the air that I breathe!
(Don't pull my nerve!)
You are the air that I breathe!
(Don't pull my nerve!)
You are the air that I breathe!
(Don't pull my nerve!)
You are the air that I breathe!
(Don't pull my nerve!)
You are the air that I breathe!
All that I need!
All that I need!
Our house is burning right before our eyes
And ain't nobody a bit surprised
You prayed for rain and I fell down all night
Love me 'till the ambulance arrives
Until I can't hear the screams and cries
And I'll be choking on my ABC's all night

One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five seconds to live
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five is all I can give
One one thousand - Two one thousand - Three one thousand
Four and five seconds again
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds - Four seconds - Five seconds
Here we go!

You are the air that I breathe!Embed
