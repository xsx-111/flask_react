Caipirinha Lyrics
Everyday
Is a dream, it's obscene
I wish I was there
Far away
Having fun in the sun, my feet in the sand
But here I am
Freezing cold, shoveling snow
But why should you care?

I wish I was there
I wish I was there
It always begins
And never ends

Winter breeze
And I freeze, screaming "Please"
I wish I was there
Cruel cold, chilled by snow
All alone, a stone in the air
But here I am
Sweat and heat at the beach
And you're not my friend
I wish I was there
I wish I was there
It always begins and never ends

Chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah
Chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah
Chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah
Chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah
Chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah
Chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah, chaka-ooh-ah

I wish I was there
I wish I was there
It always begins and never ends
Never ends, never ends
I wish I was there1Embed
