Sucker Lyrics
You suck
You suck
You suck
You suck
You suck
You suck
You suck
You

When I fall asleep you take a peek indoors
I will take what's mine, you will take what's yours
You play with loaded dice and a gun in the drawer
But now I'm going to even the score

There's one born every minute, sucker, sucker
So keep it in your pants, will you, sucker, sucker
What makes you think you're my only lover?
The truth kinda hurts, don't it, motherfucker?
Sucker

You suck
You suck
You suck
You
You see my fingers twitching and my nervous glance
I thought you were bluffing, but you saw my hand
Lost in phony laughter and free mixed drinks
It's time to take a chance, I think

There's one born every minute, sucker, sucker
So keep it in your pants, will you, sucker, sucker
What makes you think you're my only lover?
The truth kinda hurts, don't it, motherfucker?
