Your Neighborhood Spaceman LyricsI'm your neighborhood spaceman
You don't know who I am
Or where I've been
Circling like a satellite
The sign post in the sky
Look at me!
I'm really just a tambourine
The world is shaking me
So listen!
Cos now I'm gonna sing
I'm comin' home
You hear my song through the galaxy
When timeless light has reached your eyes
World has lived and died, but we're here
Time and space are landing right where we're standing
Open up your hand and something good will happen
Drinking from the sun we found our own new planet
Stars align a thousand times that old black magic
When no one is looking -
Ain't gonna shut my mouth and I'm crying out
When no one is looking -
Under your balcony, singing the serenade
When no one is looking -
I swallow thunder clouds, I kiss the hollowed ground
When no one is looking -
I eat the desert sand and drink the Rio Grande
When no one is looking -
I'm crying raindrops and chewing mountain tops
When no one is looking -
I break another rhyme and I'm stopping time
I'm your neighborhood spaceman
And your breath is moving through me
On the surface of this moon
I can say to you "It's okay"
Somebody inside of us
Makes this joy a must
Then we'll be
Knee deep in ecstasy
No gravity to hold us down again
We're free!
A thousand light years
From this place
I see the look on your face
And I'm there
Time and space are landing right where we're standing
Open up your hand and something good will happen
Drinking from the sun we found our own new planet
Stars align a thousand times that old black magic
When no one is looking -
I'm gonna buckle down, I'm gonna hit the ground
When no one is looking -
I got to understand, I'm packin' up again
When no one is looking -
I'll pull the car around cause I'm leaving town
When no one is looking -
I'm just a rocket man, I've seen the light again
I'll never give up -
I'll never let you down, I'll bring you the crown
I'm open enough -
But on the other hand, I wanna be the man
I'll never give up -
I'll never let you down, I'll bring you the crown
I'm courageous enough -
But on the other hand, I'm out of here, my friendEmbed
