Kill the DJ LyricsYour happiness is my business
I'm practicin' like a violin
I see your face when I hear that song
It's in my head playing on and on
Play me, play me
It's much too quiet to drink at home
It's much too kinky on the telephone
Stick in a quarter, let that jukebox sing
Don't let that goddamn record spin again
Play me, play me, play me
Play me!
(play me, play me, play me, play me )
On every street corner, every bar
On every radio in every car
In every club, every dance floor
Hiding right behind every door
In every restaurant, every plane
On every ghettoblaster from here to Spain
In every elevator, every PA
The speakers pumping calling out your name
Play me!(play me, play me) Play me!(play me, play me) Play me!(play me, play me) Play me!(play me, play me)Embed
