Pacer LyricsNow I like to get loud
I like to go to the other side
Just to think, you were just passing by
Riding around
You spat in my eye
Just to think, you were just passing by
We were hike to hike
Breezing by
You broke the pace
Just a twisted kid, never learned to ride
Now I like to get loud
I like to go to the other side
Just to think, you were just passing by
We were hike to hike
Breezing by
You broke the pace
Just a twisted kid, never learned to ride
Now my wheels are off the ground
They keep spinning around
Just to think, you were just passing by
Now I like to get loud
Go to the other side
Just to think, you were just passing byEmbed
