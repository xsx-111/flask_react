Empty Glasses LyricsEmpty glasses
There's just ice cubes
Where's the waitress?!?
Where's my other shoe?!?
That's the boy I like now (?)
Got this full cup
I have a chance
At the port
I was convinced!
The joint's on the snare!
Empty
Empty
Empty glasses
Empty glasses
The joint's on the snare!!
Empty
Empty glasses
There's just ice cubes
Where's the waitress?!?
Where's my other shoe?!?
(There's my other shoe!)
The joint's on the snare!
Empty
Empty
I had a chance
At the port; I was convinced!
The joint's on the snare!
Empty
