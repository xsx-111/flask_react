I Am Decided LyricsI'd like to fly out
Fly away from here
Find you up with beers
Man I'm stoned
I want to change
And not make a sound
I'm out of town
I am decided
I will be better to fly tonight
I need to learn
How you look so well
And you glow
I want to know
Better watch your ass
The time is moving fast
I am decided
I will be better to fly tonightEmbed
