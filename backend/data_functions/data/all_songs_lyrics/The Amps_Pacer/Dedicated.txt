Dedicated LyricsIf you wore one big mask
You'd never get a chance to kick ass
Demons in the spring
I can hear them sing
"I'll be coming"
Whenever note follows note
Dedicated all to you (me)
Dedicated all to you (me)
Aaaaaaah hope you've got a minute
Yeah, I'd love a minute of time
Or they all go "Fuck it if you're winded"
You know, givin' me the rhyme
Demons in the spring
I can hear them sing
"I'll be coming"
Whenever note follows note
Dedicated all to you (me)
Dedicated all to you (me)
Aaaaah, hope you've got a minute
Yeah, I've got a minute of time
For they all go, "Fuck it if you're wasted"
You know, givin' me a rhyme
Demons in the spring
I can hear them sing
"I'll be coming"
Whenever note follows note
Dedicated all to you (me)
Dedicated all to you (me)
Dedicated all
Dedicated, dedicated, dedicated
If you wore one big mask
You'd never get a chance to kick ass
Demons in the spring
I can hear them sing
"I'll be coming"
Whenever note follows note
Dedicated all to you (me)
Dedicated all
As long as note follows note
The string things out for string
So many for "moi"
Dedicated all
Dedicated, dedicatedEmbed
