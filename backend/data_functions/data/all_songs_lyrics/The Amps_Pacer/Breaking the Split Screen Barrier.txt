Breaking the Split Screen Barrier LyricsYou gave me no assist
At the holidays
Now that they're dead and gone
Power on
Humming eighty venus
Humming eighty venus
Humming eighty venus
I know you're not sane anymore
That doesn't mean you're fine
One in this alter-sound
Die around
Humming eighty venus
Humming eighty venusEmbed
