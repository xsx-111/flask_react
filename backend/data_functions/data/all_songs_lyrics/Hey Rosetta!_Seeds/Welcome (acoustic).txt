Welcome (acoustic) LyricsYou'll be a bright light coming out of the dark
All the doctors blinking hard
You'll be lightning coming out of the storm
It's a message, it's a miracle
You'll do all right
You've got your mother's eyes
You've got your daddy's head
Everything you need
For this hard ride
They'll be strapping you on
All the ups and downs and you can't get off
Yes, trouble we're handing off
And you've got to do better than us
It'll be all right
You've got lots of time
Got your daddy's love
Everything you want
I can feel you and what you're gonna be
You'll be stronger, you'll be smarter than me
Oh baby, I'll say it again
You're the most incredible thing
Sorry, this is it
It's cold and hard and badly lit
And there's no backing out of it
So forget where you've been
It'll never be that good again
And we must only look ahead
Soon you're 33
And everything you tried to be
Is pulled apart by fear and greed
Let young hands build you up
And carve your face in honest rock
With sunlight on your noble jaw
May young hands build you up
I'm happy that you've come along
I'm happy that you've come, I'm happy that you've come
Oh baby, I'll say it again
I'll say it again, I'll say it
You're the most incredible thingEmbed
