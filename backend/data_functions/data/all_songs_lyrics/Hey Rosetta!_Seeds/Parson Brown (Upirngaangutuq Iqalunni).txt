Parson Brown (Upirngaangutuq Iqalunni) LyricsCouldn't shake the cold away
A year alone, stock still and stuck in snow
Two black eyes, this phony smile
My senses dead, my body bent in ice
Then you took off your winter clothes
And you leaned against with your eager innocence
My brittle knotted wrists twitched
Reaching out for it
When we're running from the hospital, don't stop. don't stop
Though the guards'll call, and the cops'll come, don't stop. don't stop
They do not know us. we don't stop because of our love. our love
And we don't need their law, like the paper it's written on, it will fade. it will melt away
Like snow, it runs to the river belowEmbed
