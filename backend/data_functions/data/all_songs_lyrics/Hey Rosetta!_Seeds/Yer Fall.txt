Yer Fall LyricsIn the wet grass out back
We spread the sheet
And with one last easy laugh
The night released
We breathed the dark, the shaking stars
The distant, constant cars
Breathed the sweet
Air between us
What was it like?
To be young, strong, stupid and drunk
Soft in the jagged night
My open, rosy throat
Dekeing secret knives
Now we close these petals
To the oncoming ice
And I'm not coming out, I'm not coming out, I'm not coming out, I'm not coming out
My love, my love is dead I buried it
In the falling leaves, looking awful green, in the whipping wind
My love, my love is dead I buried it
And it's better hid, all the shit we sling into the whipping wind
My love, my love is dead I buried it
Just an honest kid, I always did everything they said
My love, my love is dead I buried it
What a senseless thing! this heart in shreds in the whipping wind!Embed
