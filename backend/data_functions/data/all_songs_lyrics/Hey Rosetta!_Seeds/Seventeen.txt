Seventeen LyricsWe watch the land
And imagine our bodies buried within
All the blurring green
Imagine our bodies hovering
We're always on the edge
We're always on the edge of something bigger than this
Said: I ain't married yet
Not some marionette
I cut my strings and I went wandering
Between two poles
One was dirt and the other was gold
They push and pull
If one is evil is the other one good?
Is it good?
Cause we're always on the edge
We're always on the edge of something bigger than this
Cause we're always on the edge
We're always on the edge of some impossible trick
I spit my piece
The words are sweet
But they hardly speak
So I shut my teeth and I won't say anything
I'm losing you. I can see it
I'm losing you. I can see it
I can see it. I can see through. the thin skin's moving. I can see through it
Like a loose balloon, I am lost and loving the viewEmbed
