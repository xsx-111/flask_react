Bricks LyricsJust feel them multiply
Like hungry flies in the sweet summer night
In the woods they were waiting, in a word they arrived
One doubt from your red mouth, and armies align
And once you say it you can't take it back
It was a beautiful home we had, built with our own two hands
And the amber years we got left, gone in a single breath
They put their eyes to their rifles
There was a quick fist of light
And we were bricks in a pile
Cause once you say it you can't take it back
Oh once you say it you can't take it back
Feel them multiply
Like a hundred eyes aiming at the words in your breath
And then the flies break the flesh and go into your chestEmbed
