Bandages LyricsIt will come around
But everything is now
I know everything is right now
And the loneliness is a lot
The nothing weighs a ton
I mean the nothing weighs a fucking ton
That half of the bed
Empty like a page
Of the cursive claims you've yet to make
Oh, the promising light
Bending like a spine
Or the whiteness that your pen could write
If you get these bandages off
You could stand, you can walk
Leave these towels and gauze
You get up, you get out
Into the sun
That's where we belong
We've been abed too long
All our weaknesses are growing strong
And the winter always ends
With water on your lips
The April rain comes swinging in
Take these bandages off
Let me stand, let me walk
Leave these towels and gauze
Let me up, let me out
Into the sun
'Cause, come she will
Come she will
Oh Come, she will
Come she will
She will
She comes, oh
She comes, son
She cooooomes
She comes, oh
She comes, son
She cooooomes
She comes, oh
She comes, son
She cooooomes
She comes, oh
She comes, son
She cooooomes
She comes, oh
She comes, son
She cooooomes
She comes, oh
She comes, son
She cooooomes
She comes, oh
She comes, son
She cooooomesEmbed
