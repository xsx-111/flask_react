Yer Spring LyricsLong we were searching these serpentine streets for the signs of a spark
Fucking around in the dark
Long we were held in the thrum and the desperate heat of the clubs
Drinking deep from that cup
We'd drink it up
We'd drink it up
We'd drink it up
Each step was something
The beat in the blood and the heat in our hands
Of Twelve regular men
So when we come down Cathedral Street
Hollow and beaten to the room that I rent
I'm going back up again
I'm going up
I'm going up
I'm going up
I'm going up
But while everything is blooming
You know the wilting always waits
To steal away your body
To steal away your brains
Oh man, I hate this part
When the car sails off the bridge
Am I the knuckles white inside?
Am I the water rushing in?
Am I rising up?
Am I rising up?
Am I rising up?
Singing:
Silent night, holy night
Take my eyes, take my mind and lay me down!
Oh! Sweet winter kiss on these heavy lids!
Sweet winter gift of dreamless sleep, lay me down! Draw me out!
Doctor unbandage my eyes
I feel the light and I'm ready to be out in it
Doctor uncover my ears
I hear the chorus weeping, I see the people singing
Doctor unbandage my eyes
I feel the light and I'm ready to be rising!
Doctor uncover my ears!
I hear the chorus weeping! I see the people singing...
Let the loser up
Let the loser up
Let's get him up
Let's get him up
Let's get him up
Let's get him up
Let's get him up
Let's get him up
