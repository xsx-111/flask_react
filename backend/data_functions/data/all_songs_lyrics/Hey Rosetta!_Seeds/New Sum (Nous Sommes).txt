New Sum (Nous Sommes) LyricsOh see the great citizens
With all their white sticks tapping brick
They can't see the wire strung in between them
And all that young scum reeling
But oh you do your blinded best
With all these arrows through your chest
Feel em forcing through and they're forcing you
To follow through to where they want you
Was it a trick of light? shook my head from side to side
I seen a million lines, the finest thread strung spine to spine
Animals run on the sidewalks
Animals run in the national parks
And all the bankers and all the beggars and all the bears are brothers
Is it a trick of light? I shake my head from side to side
We rub our eyes and shake our fists at the passersby
We scare the kids but mama it's all for the best
What is the new sum, us tied up? with no thumbs?
Is it a noose hung? and us tied up? with no thumbs?
Yeah but in the new sum you gotta count us, we see the lines run
We see the lines run, can you see them? can you see them?
Can you see them?Embed
