Mambo Rock LyricsHey mambo, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Everybody's doing it, mambo rock
There's an island in the Carribean Sea
Where the natives dance and rock with plea
The mambo dance in a different way
They do the crazy mambo rock all day
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Everybody's doing it, mambo rock
Where the waves roll up on the golden sand
Grab your chick right by the hand
You can clap and stamp your feet
To that crazy rockin' mambo beat
Oh, hey mambo, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Everybody's doing it, mambo rock
Through the red hot day and the cool-cool night
When the mambo moon is shining bright
They love to dance around the clock
To that crazy rockin' mambo beat
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Everybody's doing it, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Hey mambo, mambo rock
Everybody's doing it, mambo rockEmbed
