Thirteen Women LyricsLast night I was dreaming
Dreamed about the H-bomb
Well, the bomb went off
And I was caught
I was the only man underground
There was a thirteen women
And only one man in town
Thirteen women
And only one man in town
And as funny as it may be
The one and only man in town was me
Well, thirteen women
And me the only man around
I had two gals every morning
Seeing that I was well fed
And believe you me
One sweetened my tea
While another one buttered my bread
Two gals gave me my money
Two gals made me my clothes
And another sweet thing
Bought me a diamond ring
About forty carets, I suppose
Well, thirteen women
And only one man in town
There was a thirteen women
And only one man in town
There was something I can’t forget
Because I think of those
Thirteen women and yet
Well, thirteen women
And only one man around
I had three girls dancing the mambo
Three girls balling the jack
And all the rest really did their best
Boy, they sure were a lively pack
I thought I was in heaven
And all of these angels were mine
But I woke up and I ended the dream
Cause I had to get to work on time
Well, thirteen women
And only one man in town
There was a thirteen women
And only one man in town
No, I can’t tell you where I’ve been
Cause I kinda think that someday
I’ll go back again
To those thirteen women
And me the only man aroundEmbed
