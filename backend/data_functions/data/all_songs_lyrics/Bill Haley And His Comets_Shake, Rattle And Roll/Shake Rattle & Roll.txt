Shake Rattle & Roll Lyrics
Get out in that kitchen
And rattle those pots and pans
Get out in that kitchen
And rattle those pots and pans
Well, roll my breakfast
'Cause I'm a hungry man

I said, shake, rattle and roll
I said, shake, rattle and roll
I said, shake, rattle and roll
I said, shake, rattle and roll
Well, you'll never do nothing
To save your doggone soul

Wearing those dresses
Your hair done up so nice
Wearing those dresses
Your hair done up so nice
You look so warm
But your heart is cold as ice

I said, shake, rattle and roll
I said, shake, rattle and roll
I said, shake, rattle and roll
I said, shake, rattle and roll
Well, you'll never do nothing
To save your doggone soul
Go
Go
Go
Go

I'm like a one-eyed cat
Peeping in a seafood store
I'm like a one-eyed cat
Peeping in a seafood store
I can look at you
And tell you don't love me no more

I believe you're doing me wrong
And now I know
I believe you're doing me wrong
And now I know
The more I work
The faster my money goes

I said, shake, rattle and roll
I said, shake, rattle and roll
I said, shake, rattle and roll
I said, shake, rattle and roll
Well, you'll never do nothing
To save your doggone soul
Shake, rattle and rollEmbed
