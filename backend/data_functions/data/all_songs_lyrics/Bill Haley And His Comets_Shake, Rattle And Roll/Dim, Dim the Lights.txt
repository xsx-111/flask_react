Dim, Dim the Lights LyricsOh, what a crazy party
All the gang’s here too
The beat is really jumping
Like a kangaroo
I’m full of soda and potato chips
But now I wanna get a taste
Of your sweet lips
So dim, dim the lights
Turn down the lights
I want some atmosphere
The furniture was bouncing
‘Round the room with glee
And rocking like a boat
Upon a stormy sea
I dig the crazy flock
That’s running wild tonight
But still, I haven’t had a chance
To hold you tight
Looking at his earrings
Bouncing off the back
Look at Susie kissing and hugging Jack
Look at Nancy dancing
In her stocking feet
We’re all going crazy
With the mambo beat
But everybody’s really having lots of fun
But honey, as for me
The night has just begun
Cause now I wanna tell you things
And hold you tight
But how can I do it
With the room so bright?
So dim, dim the lights
Turn down the lights
I want some atmosphereEmbed
