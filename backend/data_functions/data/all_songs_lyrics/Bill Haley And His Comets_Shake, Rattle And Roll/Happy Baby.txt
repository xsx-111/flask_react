Happy Baby Lyrics(Happy, happy baby, happy, happy baby)
(Happy happy baby, happy happy baby)
(Happy happy baby)
I got a baby and my baby's happy with me (happy baby)
I got a baby and my baby's happy with me (happy baby)
A slick little chick and she treats me tenderly (happy baby)
Well, I got a date with my baby, can't hesitate (happy baby)
Well, I got a date with my baby, can't hesitate (happy baby)
She's a real gone gal and man I just can't wait (happy baby)
My baby and me don't fight
We hug and we kiss all night
I love her with all of my might
She's a cute little smoothy
And she sure is groovy
Well, I'm going steady and happy I'm gonna be (happy baby)
Well, I'm going steady and steady I'm gonna be (happy baby)
Wanna keep my baby as happy as she can be (happy baby)
(Happy happy baby, happy happy baby)
(Happy happy baby, happy happy baby)
(Happy happy baby)
My baby and me don't fight
We hug and we kiss all night
I love her with all of my might
She's a cute little smoothy
And she sure is groovy
Well, I'm going steady and happy I'm gonna be (happy baby)
Well, I'm going steady and steady I'm gonna be (happy baby)
Wanna keep my baby as happy as she can be (happy baby)
(Happy happy baby, happy happy baby)
(Happy happy baby)
Well, my baby is happy with me!Embed
