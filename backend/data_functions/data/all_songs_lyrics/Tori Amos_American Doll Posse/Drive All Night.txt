Drive All Night Lyrics
I got a spandex dress and it managed to fit
Hey now, come and wreck it man
I got a kid that calls the cops before the party's started
That generation needs a lesson in sin
Now you're in my door, you say you're running on empty
Girl, I sure could use a friend

But it's a long road that goes on and on
And it drives and divides my flesh from your thorn
And it's clear, dear man, I'm not sleeping anymore
Congratulations as you lose control
And do you still need a sign to let me drive?
'Cause I can drive all night
Said I can drive all night

You say you got a vampire in your head
Love, you got one in your kitchen
She's been stringing you out since we were kids
A black hole that could swallow Jesus
And if you want the girl in the blue velvet band
She'll charm you into oblivion

But it's a long road that goes on and on
And it drives and divides my flesh from your thorn
And it's clear, dear man, I'm not sleeping anymore
Congratulations as you lose control
And do you still need a sign to let me drive?
'Cause I can drive all night
Said I can drive all night
He said "Girl, maybe I can't play your hero
In your last picture show...

But I can drive up all night
Said I can drive all night
Said I can drive all night
All night
All night "Embed
