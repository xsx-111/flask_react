Miracle Lyrics
Okay what if I could hold on, but then
Would nightmares turn back into dreams once again?
Would Lady Luck say this game has no end?
But dawn does not rise to darkness
Hold on, break your fall

I cry, "Miracle, Miracle"
But she's run from all the judges in her favourite dress
I cry, "Miracle, Miracle"
I could have used one today
"No, Miracle, Miracle"
God, I hope she's not gone far
'Cause, boys, not many D.J.s can make you a star

I look to the children, they shrug, "Don't ask us
Hope was yours to protect till we grow up"
I asked a cowboy, "Can you save the day?"
He said, "If I had me a few braves as I'm too late"

I cry, "Miracle, Miracle"
But she's run from all the judges in her favourite dress
I cry, "Miracle, Miracle"
I could have used one today
I cry, "Miracle, Miracle"
But she's run from all the judges in her favourite dress
I cry, "Miracle, Miracle"
I could have used one today
"No, Miracle, Miracle"
God, I hope she's not gone far
'Cause, boys, not many D.J.s can make, make, make you a star
I hear Miracle
I hear Miracle
I hearEmbed
