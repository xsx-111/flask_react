Body and Soul Lyrics
Sweet co, co-communion
Sweet co, co-communion
Sweet co, co-communion

I have waited all my life
You say you are bonafide to be my judge
Lay your law down on me, love
Seven devils, bring them on
I have left my weapons 'cause I think you're wrong
These devils of yours they need love

Come and kneel with me, body and soul
Come and kneel with me, body and soul
Come and kneel with me, body and soul
Body and soul
Body and soul

Sweet co, co-communion
Sweet co, co-communion

In my temple, boy, be warned
Violence doesn't have a home now, but ecstasy
That's as pure as a woman's gold
Seven devils bring them on
I have left my weapons 'cause I think you're wrong
These devils of yours they need love
Come and kneel with me, body and soul
Come and kneel with me, body and soul
Come and kneel with me, body and soul
Body and soul
Body and soul

I'll save you from that Sunday sermon
Boy, I think you need a conversion
Body and soul
Body and soul

Come and kneel with me, body and soul
Come and kneel with me, body and soul
Come and kneel with me, body and soul
Body and soul
Body and soul1Embed
