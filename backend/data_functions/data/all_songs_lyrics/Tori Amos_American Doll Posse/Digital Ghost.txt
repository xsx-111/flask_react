Digital Ghost Lyrics
It started as a joke
Just one of my larks to see
If somehow I could reach you so
I swam into your shores
Through an open window
Only to find you all alone
Curled up with machines
Now it seems you're slipping
Out of the land of the living

Just take a closer look
Take a closer look
At what it is that's really haunting you
I have to trust you'll know this digital ghost
But I fear there's only so much time
'Cause the you I knew is fading away

Hands, lay them on my keys
Let me play you again
I am not immune to your net
Find me there in it
I won't go even if in
Your heart only beats 1 and 0s
Switch you on my friend
Pull you from that rip current
But only you can fight against this
Take a closer look
Just take a closer look
At what it is that's really haunting you
I have to trust you'll know this digital ghost
But I fear there's only so much time
'Cause the you I knew is fading away

Fading
Fading away1Embed
