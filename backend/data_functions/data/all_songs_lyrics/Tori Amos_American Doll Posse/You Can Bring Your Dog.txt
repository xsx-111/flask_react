You Can Bring Your Dog Lyrics
You can bring your dog, I got three
He can play the wolf for the evening
If you were to get lost behind these locks

Ain't that a good thing?
Ain't that a good thing?
Ain't that a good thing 'cause

I'm not making any promises
I'm not living to be the Mrs
I'm not making any promises, honey
But you still got that something, pretty boy
You still got that something as a man
You still got that something
Of this I know, of this I know

That one fancies herself as a black lab
I hear that your old flame is a pure breed
Me? I guess you could say I'm a Siamese

Ain't that a good thing?
Ain't that a good thing?
Ain't that a good thing 'cause
I'm not making any promises
You'll be too busy boy to sue her for damages
I'm not making any promises, honey
But you still got that something, pretty boy
You still got that something as a man
You still got that something
Of this I know, of this I know

You can bring your dog, anytime
You can bring your dog
You can bring your dog
You can bring them all
You can bring your mom
Bring your dog, baby, baby, baby
Please now bring bring your love1Embed
