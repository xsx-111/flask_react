Velvet Revolution Lyrics
Feeling radical in cotton, purified in my satin
But the bomb of the season is a velvet revolution

I look at the sky
And feel the tears of the prophets crying
I look at the sky
And feel the rain, the rain of tears

Feeling radical in cotton, purified in my satin
But the bomb of the season is a velvet revolution
All you killers of the children, there's a new commandment
The true Divine Creator wants a velvet revolution
All you killers of the children, there's a new commandment
The true Divine Creator wants a velvet revolution1Embed
