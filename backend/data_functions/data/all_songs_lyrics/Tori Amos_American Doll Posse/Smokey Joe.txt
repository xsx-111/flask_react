Smokey Joe Lyrics
Smokey Joe, you're calling at the station
"If I kill him there are complications"
I did not ask for this
"Oh, but love, yes you did"

Maybe it terrifies me
It's too, too easy
It's too easy
This quiet siege
It's too, too easy
To wish you harm
Maybe it terrifies me
You threw black ice
At the bottom of the river

Smokey Joe hey what's a revelation
My dark twin, the annihilating feminine
"That one's past is not a destination
Does not need civilising
It is a road for fools
Who need empty approvals"

Maybe it terrifies me
It's too, too easy
It's too easy
This quiet siege
It's too, too easy
To wish you harm
Maybe it terrifies me
You threw black ice
At the bottom of the river
Smokey Joe hey can you pass the pipe
A song-less robin, she became
You have been blessed now go be wise
He stole my sister Clitorides
"It is a coward who will say he's not afraid
These silken rubber gloves
Of dying when clearly he is potently alive"
Choking his vitriolic tongue

Maybe it terrifies me
It's too, too easy
It's too easy
This quiet siege
It's too, too easy
To wish you harm
Maybe it terrifies me
It's too easy
This quiet siege
It's too, too easy
You threw black ice
At the bottom of the river

Smokey Joe is calling at the station
Calling at the station1Embed
