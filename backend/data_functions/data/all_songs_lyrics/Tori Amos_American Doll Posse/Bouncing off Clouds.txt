Bouncing off Clouds Lyrics
Bouncing off of clouds we were
Is there a love lost and found?

Make it easy, make this easy
It's not as heavy as it seems
Wrapped in metal, wrapped in ivy
Painted in mint ice cream

We could be bouncing off the top of this cloud
I put on my silver
Bouncing off the top of this cloud

Failure to respond, but
I did. but did you listen

Bouncing off the top of this cloud
I put on my silver
About what you said, has it come to this?
I put on my silver
Bouncing off the top of this cloud
Well, you can stare all day at the sky
But that won't bring her back, that won't bring her back
You say you're waiting on fate
But I think fate is now, I think fate is now
Waiting on us

Make it easy, easy, easy
We could make this easy, easy love, easy
We could make this easy, make this easy
It's not as heavy as it seems
We could make this easy, make this easy
It's not as heavy as it seems
Wrapped in metal, wrapped in ivy
Blue umbrellas smiling

We could be bouncing off the top of this cloud
I put on my silver
About what you said, has it come to this?
I put on my silver
Bouncing off the top of this cloud
I put on my silver
About what you said, has it come to this?
I put on my silver
Bouncing off of clouds we were1Embed
