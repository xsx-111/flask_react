Girl Disappearing Lyrics
7 am, so it begins again
1 zip favouring familiar silhouettes
Left whips and chains behind I'm boycotting trends
It's my new look this season

Riding on backs of palominos primed for an attack
It's as good, as good as it gets

With girl disappearing
What on earth's occurring?
'Cause she's right in front of me
A girl disappearing
To some secret prison
Behind her eyes she whispers
"Big surprise, there was
No protection by this urban light
So I'm running to
A constellation where they can still see you"

Envy can spread, herself so thinly
She slipped in before I could notice it
In my own war, blood in the cherry zone
When they pit woman against feminist
Riding on backs of palominos ditching the blond shell
Working her hell on that red carpet

With girl disappearing
What on earth's occurring?
'Cause she's right in front of me
A girl disappearing
To some secret prison
But she's right in front of me
A girl disappearing
To some secret prison
Behind her eyes she whispers
"Big surprise, there was
No protection by this urban light
So I'm running to
A constellation where they can still see you"
Then I'm running too
If that's a consolation 'cause I can still see you1Embed
