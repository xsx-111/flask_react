My Posse Can Do Lyrics
I don't know what you've been playing
I don't know why I've been staying
I got me some better things to do
I do mind what you been saying
I don't know why I've been staying
I got me some better things to do
Boys, you give me the beat

Tippy-tippy-ty, tippy-tippy-toe
Tippy-tippy-ty all over the world
There be things that my posse can do
Tippy-tippy-ty, tippy-tippy-toe
Tippy-tippy-ty all over the world
There be things that my posse can do

Save yourself the lie, I see it in your eyes
You've been having you a wonderful crime
She can flip her hair, I can flip you off
You got talents but, baby, I'm thinking they're not enough

I don't know what you've been playing
I don't know why I've been staying
I got me some better things to do
I don't do so well in traffic
Or with leaders who don't have it
I got me some better things to do
Boys, you give me the beat
Tippy-tippy-ty, tippy-tippy-toe
Tippy-tippy-ty all over the world
There be things that my posse can do
Tippy-tippy-ty, tippy-tippy-toe
Tippy-tippy-ty all over the world
There be things that my posse can do

A Formula One racer or the Pope
Presidential posts you say aren't for girls
That's the way it's been up until today
There's another way
Maybe this girl's got a taste to misbehave

I don't know what you've been playing
I don't know why I've been staying
I got me some better things to do
Brothers, I say hallelujah
You proselytise and compute
All them things that your posse can do
Boys, you give me the beat

Tippy-tippy-ty, tippy-tippy-toe
Tippy-tippy-ty all over the world
Tippy-tippy-ty, tippy-tippy-toe
Tippy-tippy-ty all over the world
Tippy-tippy-ty, tippy-tippy-toe
Tippy-tippy-ty all over the world
There be things that my posse
There be things, I say, yo, hallelujah
There be things that my posse can do
Boys, you give me the beatEmbed
