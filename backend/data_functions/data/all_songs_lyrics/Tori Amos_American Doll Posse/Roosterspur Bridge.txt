Roosterspur Bridge Lyrics
Somewhere down past Roosterspur Bridge
Perhaps just a trick of the light
I thought I heard the sweetest guitar
Was it a rock and roll Jesus?

Sometimes I think
I think I understand
The fear in the boy
The fire in the man
Sometimes I watch
The wonder in your eyes
That and you leaving
I have memorised
That and you leaving
I have memorised

Drove all night through Sliding Rock Falls
Thinking I'd find something that we'd lost
Can't remember when you stopped laughing
Or when I stopped wanting to win

Sometimes I think
I think I understand
The fear in the boy
The fire in the man
Sometimes I watch
The wonder in your eyes
That and you leaving
I have memorised
Do you even see me now?
Do you think of us still?
Do I always read things in
Before a day's deliverance
On Roosterspur bridge

Sometimes I think
I think I understand
The fear in the boy
The fire in the man
Sometimes I watch
The wonder in your eyes
That and you leaving
I have memorised
That and you leaving
That and you leaving
I have memorised, yeah1Embed
