Teenage Hustling Lyrics
You think you can come around here
All up in his face
All up in my world

You better know, you better know, you better know
I'm at your door, I'm at your door, I'm at your door
You better know, you better know, you better know
I'm at your door, I'm at your door, I'm at your

You gotta right, you gotta right to know
You gotta right, you gotta right to know
Me and my teenage hustling

I've been working it
Since I's fourteen
Me and my teenage hustling
I've been working it
Since I's fourteen
Me and my teenage hustling
It's gonna save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me
From your dirty dealings
You're a dirty girl
You're such a dirty girl
You better know, you better know, you better know
I'm at your door, I'm at your door, I'm at your door
You better know, you better know, you better know
I'm at your door, I'm at your door, I'm at your

Maybe the riddle of this accident goes back to your gossip
With a ferocious strategy you play wounded in his cockpit
But I think that you forgot my days of teenage hustling

You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your door
You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your

You gotta right you gotta right to know
You gotta right you gotta right to know
You gotta right you gotta right to know

Me and my teenage hustling
I've been working it
Since I's fourteen
Me and my teenage hustling
I've been working it
Since I's fourteen
But you been skanking around with your talentless trash
You only shoot blanks at your cocksure best
Me and my teenage hustling
Me and my teenage hustling
It's gonna save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me
From your dirty dealings
Now I don't mind a dirty girl
Said I don't mind a dirty girl
You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your door
You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your door1Embed
