Yo George Lyrics
I salute to you, Commander
And I sneeze
'Cause I have now an allergy
To your policies it seems

Where have we gone wrong, America?
Mr. Lincoln we can't seem to find you anywhere
Out of the millions, from the deserts to the mountains
Over prairies, to the shores

Is this just the madness of King George?
Yo, George
Is this just the madness of King George?
Yo, George
Well you have the whole nation
On all fours1Embed
