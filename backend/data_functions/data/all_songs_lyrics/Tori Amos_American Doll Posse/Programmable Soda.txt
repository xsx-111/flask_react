Programmable Soda Lyrics
Think of me as programmable soda
Too much cherry?
Baby, then you can just add cola

Think of me as programmable soda
'Cause you can, can be a cruel fella
So okay, then I just back off
The vanilla

Think of me as programmable soda
Cause I've come, I've come to accept that
For lovelies you are a fanatic
But I can't, I can't let that throw me
Into a genital p-p-panic

Think of me as programmable soda
Too much cherry?
Baby, then you can just add cola
Think of me as programmable soda
When you think
And, boy, when you drink
When you think of me1Embed
