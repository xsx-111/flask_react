Posse Bonus Lyrics
This is your posse bonus, this is your extra
This is your posse bonus 'cause I like you
This is your posse bonus, this is your extra
This is your posse bonus 'cause I like you

Because I like you, cause I like you, porcupine
Burrow your way to freedom

This is your posse bonus, this is your extra
This is your posse bonus 'cause I like you

Eat your greens
Feed your head
Mind the doubts, they harvest them
Broccoli
Feed your head
Their ideas are fried in fat

This is your posse bonus, this is your extra
This is your posse bonus 'cause I like you
Because I like you, cause I like you, porcupine
Burrow your way to freedom

You say you're not bothered
To lie beneath pigs
Then go on, Laura
Here's a flower for your grave

This is your posse bonus, this is your extra
This is your posse bonus 'cause I like you
I like you
I like you1Embed
