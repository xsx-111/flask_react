Shintaro LyricsOh Tokyo, lived Shintaro
Little koga ninjas tried to take him away
But Shintaro he's not alone
Got Koga ninjas of his own
They help him in the fight
Look out here come the samurai
Gisha girls with silk and curls
Giggle about this guy
They want to comb his pony tail
Become Mrs. Samurai
But he's a fat little jap chap
But don't you tell him that
He might slice you in two
Or get tombay the mist on to you
Oh Toyko, Lived Shintaro
Oh Toyko, Lived Shintaro
Oh Toyko, Oh ToykoEmbed
