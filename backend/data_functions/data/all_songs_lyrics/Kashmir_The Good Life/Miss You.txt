Miss You LyricsThere's a shark deep down under
I try to call her name
But the dark water's between us
It makes me call in vain
Surfing on the surface
With my fingers in the water
But she seems to have lost her
Interest in me
I miss you all the time
Though you sit next to me
I hope you feel just fine
Wherever you may be
Whatever's in your way
Among the few indulgent sailors
I am the patient one
You're the muse
So involved with
The fingers in your hair
I miss you all the time...
I pray for you
For your return
In me you will forever burnEmbed
