Gorgeous LyricsThe lonely loonies on the playground
Reveal their shadows to the day
They crash in planes on smack and weird sounds
And leaves us gold upon their graves
Our lives becomes less ordinary
Show us that it doesn't hurt to die
Is it so gorgeous
Is it enchanted
Is it revealing
I feel so lucky I have seen you
And rapture spread among the crowd
I wish for once I could have met you
Before they wrapped you in a shroud
The giants always get their heads chopped
Or drown in muddy waters in the south
Is it so gorgeous
Is it enchanted
Is it forever
Is it so gorgeous
Is it enchanted
Is it eternal
With a rude tongue dressed in spiteful eloquence
You would call
Calling for a love that never came
You would wait, you would call
And you'd wait and you'd call
Back here I am in search of answers
I won't accept what I was told
It's only fair to die from cancer
When you're old enough to say you're old
The reverb you left is never over
Tolling for the only one who is not present -
Still so gorgeous
So enchanted
So forever
Is it so gorgeous
Is it enhanted
Is it eternal
Is it tomorrowEmbed
