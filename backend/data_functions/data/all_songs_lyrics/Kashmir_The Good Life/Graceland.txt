Graceland Lyrics
I wish I lived in Graceland
But I only had one day
A postcard from the main land
Is all I have today

Forty thousand million
And a Rolls Royce engine
Couldn't take me anywhere
Yes I tried with aspirin
And a nice calm weekend
But my heart has left me here

I wish I had that skin tan
That you are born into
They'd see me as a warm man
Just like they're seeing you


I drown in my drool
Over all the goodies that they get
I drown in a pool
In a pool of my own sweat
