Mom In Love, Daddy In Space Lyrics
Walking bones
Choose your own direction
Go have fun
Some place else
Bring your soul
And your Beach Boys records
I can't stand
To have you here
So worn out
Cold and dehydrated
The fortune is spent
And dad is in space

Every home should have a mom in love
And a daddy in space
Chinese porcelain cats
To guard her love
In the window space
Show her some respect
She's all worn down

For years to come
I will not forget you
As my son
As my pain
Time will heal
What now feels so wounded
Tears are spilled
And the holes will fill
Every home should have a mom in love
And a daddy in space
Chinese porcelain cats
To guard her love
In the window space
Show her some respect
She's all worn down
Show her some respect
She's all worn down
Show her some respect
She's all worn down

Every home should have a mom in love
And a daddy in space
Chinese porcelain cats
To guard her love
In the window spaceEmbed
