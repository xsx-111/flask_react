I Want To Touch You Lyrics
I always thought the way you talked was neat
And I dreamed that when you speak, you speak to me
But you're always out of reach and i can't control my speech
And I'm scared that when we meet, I'll want to touch you

I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you


You're the only soul inside that makes me shake
And the crazy senseless things you make me take
It would really make my day if you'd only move away
'Cause I'm scared that if you stay, I'll want to touch you

I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you

But you're always out of reach and i can't control my speech
And I'm scared that when we meet
I'm fermenting, can't you see

I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
Touch you, touch you, touch you, touch you, touch youEmbed
