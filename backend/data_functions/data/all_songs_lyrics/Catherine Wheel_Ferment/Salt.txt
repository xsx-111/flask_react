Salt Lyrics(Oh safe towards yourself)
(She wants you with all your heart)
Between me always spinning ride
I slowly roll and seem to fly
The taste of salt and spinning ice
The taste of you it brings me higher
In this your shine
It's always time
It's always time
Oh we're only salt
Oh we're only salt
Oh we're only salt
It always felt like suicide
It always takes my life aside
To say I might, to say I will
The hardest part the heart is real
We miss your shine
It's only time
It's only time
It's only salt
It's only seas
It's only time
It's only time
I want to see myself in time
We miss your shine
It's only time
It's only timeEmbed
