Tumbledown LyricsShout just to make it clear
So loud so as you don't hear
That I made no sound
The second time around
If all is turned around
So smooth just to show you care
You built a new mountain there
That I can tumble down
The very first time around
The very first time around
The very first time around
I let you see how high life could be
But you dropped me down
The very first time around
The very first time around
The very first time around
(are you in love with someone) ??? (let me tumble down) ???Embed
