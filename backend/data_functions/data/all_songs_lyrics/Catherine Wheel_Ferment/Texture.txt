Texture Lyrics
Safe on the shore I've been sleeping
Faced by the thoughts I've been keeping
To break down the door of my life
I need more texture

You need to give me more texture, texture, texture
You need to give me more texture

So deep inside I've been dreaming
In a space too confined, too concealing
It's a race to remind you of days I can't find

You need to give me more texture, texture, texture
You need to give me more

To break down the door of my life
I need more texture

You need to give me more
You need to give me more
Texture, texture, texture
You need to give me more texture, texture1Embed
