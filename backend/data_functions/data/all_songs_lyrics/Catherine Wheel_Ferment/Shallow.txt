Shallow LyricsYou're wasting time
Time to shake and throw down
But I can't fight
You are the one to say goodbye
And when you shout my mouth is dry
Only when you try
Is your shallow water running high
You know what's inside
So glad to see
You take my hand between your knees
And once inside
I'll only take the things that shine
You always said those things were mine
You only said goodbye
When your shallow water got too high
You know what's inside
Only when you try
Because your shallow water growing high
You know what's inside
You know what's inside
You know what's inside1Embed
