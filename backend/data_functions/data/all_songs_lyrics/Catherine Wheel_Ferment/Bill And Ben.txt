Bill And Ben LyricsYou're saying far too much
Your thoughts that twist and touch
You're killing time in the dark
That's coming down
Ah that's coming down
Ah...
You are young and full of heart
You are real but you are torn apart
It's taking all my time
How many days to find
Just staring up at the sun
That's coming down
Ah that's coming down
Ah...
You are young and full of heart
You are light and you are dark
You are real but torn apart
You are losing
You are young and full of heart
You are light and you are dark
It makes me mad, it makes me mad
You are real but you are torn apart
Ah ... Ah...Embed
