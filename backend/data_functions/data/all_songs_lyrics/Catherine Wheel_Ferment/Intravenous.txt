Intravenous LyricsI feel of ice
It's broken underground
You say it twice
Eventually turn 'round
Always it's the same
You never understand me
Understand me
It's too confused
And this is never found
I'm just like you
Inject me when I'm down
Always it's the same
You never understand me
Always it's the same
Your intravenous life is easy
Is easy
Always it's the same
You never understand me
Always it's the same
Your intravenous vein is easy
It's easyEmbed
