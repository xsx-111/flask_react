Ferment LyricsSugar in the heart is burning
Sweet on lips and eyes are glowing
All the things you take are spinning 'round
Such a waste but you can't taste
What's coming down
All the time you save
You can turn this movie around
Needle stings and blisters breaking
Swinging moods and conscious fading
All the things you dream while spinning 'round
Always it seems to bring you, bring you down
All the time you save
You can turn this movie around
You can turn this movie around
Ferment
Ferment
Ferment
Ferment
Judy's always fading sugar voices when the sweetness is fermented
Ferment
Fermenting, fermenting, fermenting, oh
Light, your fading light
Ferment your life
Your fading light
Ferment your life
Fermenting, fermenting, fermenting...Embed
