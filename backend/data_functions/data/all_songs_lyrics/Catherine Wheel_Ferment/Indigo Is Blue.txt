Indigo Is Blue LyricsFar from the place where I start
Is a message that you bring
Dashed aside and torn apart
Apologizing as I write
Sometimes I fade away
Sometimes I fade away
Sometimes I fade away
Sometimes...
The shame of never meaning what I say
Of looking 'round for something new
To chase the eagerness away
I use the energy to stay
Slowly falling as I fade
Indigo is blue
Indigo is blue
Sometimes I fade away
Sometimes I fade away
Sometimes I fade away
Sometimes I fade away
I fade away...Embed
