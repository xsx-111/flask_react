Balloon LyricsFlying, show me how it feels
As dreams grow sinking clouds that must be real
Losing a touch of what is mine
It's proving tough as steel and dull as life
Ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon
Ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon
Ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Gliding cuts you down and shakes your ground
I'm reeling from the height of silent sound
You know it always takes inside
As dreams go up the earth is lost in flight
Ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon
Ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon
Ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Come down, come down, come down...
Come down, come down, come down...
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon
Ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon
Ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon
