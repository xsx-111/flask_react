Flower To Hide LyricsSo make it shine
No need to fade
I'll make it hard on you
I'll make it glow
No need to show you this time
I'll make it easy
And I know
The sunlight bleaches you
It colours everything you do
And I know
A flower's fading far too soon
So think of a time
It's something to cling to
Imagine a life
That never escapes you
Conceal it behind
The colour and perfume
A flower to hide
A violet surprise
And I know
The sunlight bleaches you
It colours everything you do
And I know
A flower's fading far too soon
And I know
The sunlight bleaches you
It colours everything you do
And I know
The sunlight bleaches you
A flower's fading far too soonEmbed
