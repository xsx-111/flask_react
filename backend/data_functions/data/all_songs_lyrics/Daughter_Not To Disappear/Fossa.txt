Fossa Lyrics
I said too much, said the wrong thing
Remembering the image I was trying to project to you
Casting illusions, think I'm losing my head
Sometimes I feel
Be what you want, I can be what you want
Be what you want, I can't be what you want
(Be what you want, I can be what you want
Be what you want, I can't be what you want)

I don't know you now
But I'm lying here, somehow
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I feel sick
You're drowning in the pit of my stomach
Oh I know it's my fault
While you're busy diving down I find I feel alone (feel fine, (feel) feel fine, (feel) feel fine)
Feel a little out of my mind ((feel) feel fine, (feel) feel fine, (feel) feel fine)

Oh I'm stuck, I've said too much
I'm going mad
Checking checking waiting waiting
For some kind of response from you
Let me know
I haven't opened up
The floodgates again, to another man
Who controls the pain but never says anything, anything, anything
I don't owe you much (be what you want, I can be what you want)
But I miss you so (be what you want, I can be what you want)
I miss him (I miss him, I miss him, I miss him, I miss him, I miss him, I miss him)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Be what you want, I can be what you want)
I feel sick (Ooh-oo-)

You're drowning in the pit of my stomach
You don't know that I'm caught
Thinking you remind me of someone I can't face no more
I've gotta get him out of my mind
While you're busy diving down
I find I feel alone
I feel alone
I've gotta get him out of mind
While you're busy diving down
I find I feel alone
I feel alone
I feel alone4Embed
