How Lyrics
Moving on
Just moving in slow motion
To keep the pain to a minimum
Weightless, only wait for a fall

How long must I wait for you?
Undone in the evening
How must I wait for you
To become what I need?

Holding on, souvenirs
His words inked from birthdays
Goodbye to our empty ruins
Yeah that's when I saw her
Hold me back
Hold me back
All I am
All I am

How long
Before the last dance?
How come he's the one
To let me down?
How come they glow
Different in the evening?
How come they stare
Distant into daylight?
Like it's all alright
Like it's all alright6Embed
