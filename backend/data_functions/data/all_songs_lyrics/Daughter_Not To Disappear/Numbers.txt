Numbers Lyrics
Take the worst situations
Make a worse situation
Follow me home, pretend you
Found somebody to mend you

I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom

Chemically enlaced faces
Blackout nights in tight spaces
We'll feel distant embraces
Scratching hands round my waist, yeah
I'll wash my mouth but still taste you

I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
You better, you better, you better
You better make me
Me better, me better
You better make me better
You better, you better, you better
You better make me
Me better, me better
You better make me better
You better, you better, you better
You better make me
Me better, me better
You better make me better
You better, you better, you better
You better make me
Me better, me better
You better make me better

I feel numb, make me better
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb, make me better
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb in this kingdom11Embed
