The End Lyrics
This is the end, this is the end
You will wait to find that I am still here
And you've been waiting for the light to shine
Wake up, wake up, wake up
I'll be the answer to the question I can't answer
It's a question you can't spit it out
Can we find, we find, we find a way out
A way out

It's easier to understand
We die, we're buried underground
But I have stayed awake since then
I'm tryna find a new best friend
You instigate, come after chasing
Oh, what the hell should I say then?
I've missed you
Let's spend the future talking about the past
How you said goodbye
How I fucked your mind up
How

We really are something else
I'd say you were sent here just to keep me in check
My pulse is quick
My neck is stretched
Cruel lover says I need to just get over it
Get over him
Get over myself
They say there's something in your sky
We should pay attention
I don't care to realize
I'm too busy moping
They say there's something in our seas
We should all be careful
I'm not swimming anyway
I'm too busy moping
They say there's something in my house
That I should just get out, get out
I don't want to be escaping
No, I'm too busy moping around
I'm too busy moping around
I'm too busy moping around
I'm too busy moping around
I'm too busy moping around
Ooh
Ooh, 
Run

Take a run home, I don’t like where you’re going
Run home, I don’t like what you're saying
Run home, I don’t laugh where you’re going
Run home, I don’t like what you're saying
Take a run home, I don’t like where you’re going
Run home, I don’t like what you're saying
Run home, I don’t like where you’re going
Run home, I don’t like what you're saying1Embed
