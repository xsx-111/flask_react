Alone / With You Lyrics
I hate sleeping alone
Terrified with the lights out
I hate living alone
Talking to myself is boring conversation
Me and I are not friends
She is only an acquaintance
I hate dreaming of being alone
'Cause you are never there
Just a shadowy figure with a blank face
Kicking me out of his place
I hate walking alone
I should get a dog or something
I hate eating alone
I hate eating alone

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

I hate sleeping with you
'Cause you are never there
Just a shadowy figure with a blank face
Kicking me out of his place
I hate living with you
I should get a dog or something
I hate walking with you
Talking to myself is boring conversation
You and I were once friends
Now you're only an acquaintance
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

I hate dreaming of being with you
I hate dreaming of being with you
I hate dreaming of being with you
Terrified with the lights out
Terrified with the lights out

I hate feeling, feeling alone (Ooh-ooh)
I hate feeling, feeling alone (Ooh-ooh)
I hate feeling, feeling alone (Ooh-ooh)
I hate feeling, feeling alone (Ooh-ooh)
I hate feeling, feeling alone (Ooh-ooh)
I hate feeling, feeling alone (Ooh-ooh)
I hate feeling, feeling alone (Ooh-ooh)
I hate feeling, feeling alone (Ooh-ooh)6Embed
