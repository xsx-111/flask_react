Goodbye, baby
Baby, goodbye

Goodbye baby, so long, girl
I know you ain't gonna like it
But I'm stepping out of your world
For I'm coming to your party
And I won't be able to stay
But I'm gonna kiss you (Kiss you) one more time
Then I'm going away
Come on and sing it to me

Goodbye, baby
Baby, goodbye

You may be lonely, yes, you may be hurt
Like a fool I gave you candy
And you fed me dirt, yes
But I'm coming to your party
And just before the break of day
I'm gonna touch you (Touch you) one more time
And I'm going away
Sing it to me again
Goodbye, baby
Baby, goodbye
(Listen when I'm preachin' a little bit sometimes, mmm)

I see that train coming down a long and lonesome track
Girl, you know that I've got to go home now
And deep down in your heart you know that I'm coming back
And I'm gonna look for you at that party
'Cause all the time I know I'll find you there
And listen, I'm gonna dance (Dance)
Dance with you one more time, oh yeah
Sing it to me now

Goodbye, baby
(It makes you wanna sing sometimes)
Baby, goodbye
(And sometimes it'll make you wanna moan when you think about going home)
Goodbye, goodbye, baby, baby
(Sometimes it makes you wanna cry, children, cry, cry)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
