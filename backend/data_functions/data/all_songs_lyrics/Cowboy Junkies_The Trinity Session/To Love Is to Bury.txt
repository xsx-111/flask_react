To Love Is to Bury LyricsI buried him down by the river
'cause that's where he liked to be
And every night when the moon is high
I go there and weep openly
He and I were married
By this river 'neath this willow tree
And with God and friends witnessing it
He pledged his life to me
To me he was Earth
And I rooted in his soil
I to he was Sky vast and free
Of the burdens from which he toiled
Then one night a terrible fight
Words spoken better left unsaid
With his wedding vows ringing in my ears
He gave his life to me
They say to love is to bury
Those demons from which we all hide
But tonight by this river 'neath this willow tree
Becoming one of Earth and SkyEmbed
