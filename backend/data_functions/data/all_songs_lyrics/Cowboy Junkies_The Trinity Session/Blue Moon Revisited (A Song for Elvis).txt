Blue Moon Revisited (A Song for Elvis) LyricsI only want to say
That if there is a way
I want my baby back with me
'cause he's my true love
My only one don't you see?
And on that fateful day
Perhaps in the new sun of May
My baby walks back into my arms
I'll keep him beside me
Forever from harm
You see I was afraid
To let my baby stray
I kept him too tightly by my side
And then one sad day
He went away and he died
Blue Moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue Moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
I only want to say
That if there is a way
I want my baby back with me
'cause he's my true love
My only one don't you see?Embed
