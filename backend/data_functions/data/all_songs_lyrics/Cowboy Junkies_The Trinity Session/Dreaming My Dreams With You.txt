Dreaming My Dreams With You LyricsI hope that I find what I'm reaching for
The way that it is in my mind
I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore
And maybe to have learned this time
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you
But I won't let it change me, not if I can
I'd rather believe in love
And give it away as much as I can
To those that I am fondest of
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you
Someday I'll get over you
I'll miss dreaming with you
Someday I'll get over you
I'll miss dreaming with you
