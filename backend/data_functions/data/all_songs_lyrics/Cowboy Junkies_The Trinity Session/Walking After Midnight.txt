Walking After Midnight LyricsI was walking after midnight
Yeah, out in the moonlight
The way we used to do
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for you
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for you
I stop to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's a-crying for me
And as the skys turn gloomy
The night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well that's just my way
Of saying "I love you"
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Searching for you
I'm always walking after midnight
Yeah, out in the moonlight
Hoping you may be
Somewhere a-walking after midnight
Searching for me
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for youEmbed
