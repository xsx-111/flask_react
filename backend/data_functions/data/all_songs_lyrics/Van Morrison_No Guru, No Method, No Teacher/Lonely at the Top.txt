Lonely at the Top LyricsLonely at the top
Lonely at the bottom too
Don't know when it's gonna stop
I just don't know what to do
Lonely in the middle
Lonely in the end
Tell me, why you wanna be
Lonely at the top?
Crazy people on the phone
I can't seem to get no rest
Tell them that I'm not at home
Disconnect my telephone
Lonely in the middle
Lonely in the end, my friend
But why you wanna be
Lonely at the top?
If there ever's seen a king
Then tell me he's been here and gone
Tell me that you seen his clothes
Tell me that he have them order
He's lonely in the middle
Lonely in the end
Did you see the king
Lonely at the top?
Lonely at the top
Alright
Lonely in the middle
Lonely in the end
But why you wanna be
Lonely at the top?
Lonely at the top
Lonely at the top
Baby, you and me
Baby, stick with me
Baby, stick with me
Baby, can't you see
Baby, you and me
It's lonely at the top
Baby, you and me
It's lonely at the top
It's lonely at the top
Lonely at the top
It's lonely at the top
Lonely at the top
It's lonely at the top
It's lonely at the top
It's lonely at the top
It's lonely at the top
It's lonely at the topEmbed
