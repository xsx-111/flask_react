Oh the Warm Feeling Lyrics
Oh the warm feeling
As we sat beside the sea
Oh the warm feeling
As I sat by you

Like a child within the kingdom
As we sat beside the sea
Oh the warm feeling
As I sat by you (As I sat by you)

And it filled me with devotion
And it made me plainly see
And it healed all my emotions
As I sat by you (As I sat by you)

As we sat inside the sunshine
And we sat beside the sea
Oh the warm feeling
As I sat by you

And it filled me with religion
And it gave great comfort to me
Oh the warm feeling
As I sat by you (As I sat by you)
Oh the warm feeling
As we sat beside the sea
Oh the warm feeling
As I sat by you (As I sat by you)Embed
