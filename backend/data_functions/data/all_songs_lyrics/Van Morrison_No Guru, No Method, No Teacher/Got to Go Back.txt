Got to Go Back Lyrics
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah

When I was a young boy back in Orangefield, yeah
Used to look out my classroom window and dream, yeah
And go home and listen to Ray sing
"I Believed In My Soul" after school
Ah, that love that was within me, yeah
You know it carried me through
Well it lifted me up and it filled me
Meditation contemplation too

Got to go back
We've got to go back
Got to go back
Got to go back (Got to go back)
For the healing go on with the dreaming

All these people in the street
And the summer's almost here
Got to go outside in the fresh air
And walk while it's still clear
Breathe it in all the way down
To your stomach too
And breathe it out with a radiance
Into the nighttime air
Got to go back
We've got to go back
Got to go back (Got to go back)
Have you got to go back (Got to go back)
For the healing go on with the dreaming

Got my ticket at the airport
Well I guess I've been marking time
I've been living in another country
That operates along entirely different lines
Keep me away from porter or whiskey
Don't play anything sentimental, it'll make me cry
Got to go now my friend
Is there really any need to ask why?

I guess we've got to go back
Got to go back
People I've got to go back (Got to go back)
Well we've got to go back (Got to go back)
For the healing go on with the dreaming
Ah, we've got to go back
Baby we got to go back
People, got to go back (Got to go back)
Got to go back (Got to go back)
For the healing go on with the dreaming
With the dreaming, la la la la la
With the dreaming
With the dreaming
With the dreaming
With the dreaming
Go to sleep
