Ivory Tower Lyrics
When you come down
From your ivory tower
You will see how it really must be
When you come down, down
From your ivory tower
You will see how it really must be
To be like me
To see like me
To feel like me

Take a look at me, I'm a poor man's son
I never did no harm to no one
You've got money in the bank
I don't have none

When you come down
From your ivory tower
You will see how it really must be
When you come down, down, down
From your ivory tower
You will see how it really must be
To be like me
To see like me
To feel like me
You got rose coloured glasses
In a world that you really think
Has so much glamour to you
You've got opinions and judgments
About all kinds of things
That you don't know anything about

Don't you know the price I have to pay
Just to do everything I have to do?
Do you think that there is nothing to it?
You should try it sometime

When you come down, down, down
From your ivory tower
Oh you will see how it really must be
Oh when you come on down, down, down
From your ivory tower
Oh you will see how it really must be
To be like me
To see like me
To feel like me

To see like me
To feel like me
To see like me
To feel like meEmbed
