A Town Called Paradise Lyrics
Copycats ripped off my songs
Copycats ripped off my words
Copycats ripped off my melody
It doesn't matter what they say
It doesn't matter what they do
All that matters is my relationship to you

Gonna take you out
Get you in my car
We're going for a long long long drive
We're going down to a town called Paradise
Down where we can be free
We're gonna drink that wine
We're gonna jump for joy
In a town called Paradise, alright

We're going up the mountainside
Child, you can look for miles
And see the vision in the west
We're gonna swing round
And look north, south, east and west
And go 'round in a circle too
And we're gonna start dancing
Like we've never danced before
I'm gonna take you in my arms
I'm gonna squeeze you tight
Say everything will be alright
We're gonna get that squealin' feelin'
Gonna take you down
Baby to a town called Paradise
Down where we, we can be free
They say it doesn't matter what they say
Baby it doesn't matter what they do
All that matters is my relationship to you
We're gonna ride all night long
All along the ancient highway
Gonna be there when the mornin' comes
Oh by the river
And we drive down, down to be free
Paradise, we'll be dancing
Paradise, get my imagination too
Paradise, get my will power
Paradise, yeah, get my mindEmbed
