Thanks for the Information Lyrics
Thanks for the information
Never give a sucker an even break
When he's breaking through to a new level of consciousness
There always seems to be more obstacles in the way
Thanks for the information
I know it's only a combat zone
Thanks for the memory
I'll just have to carry on on my own

(And it's wonderful) And it's wonderful
(Marvelous) And it's marvelous
Oh baby that we can make it through
Sometimes I wonder
How we can ever make it from day to day

Thanks for the information
What you gain on the hobby horses, you lose on the swings
I like mine over easy
And you can have your sunny side up
I don't wanna quibble over insignificant details
And I've tried every trick in the book
Thanks for the information
I know I should look before I leap
(And it's wonderful) And it's wonderful
(Marvelous) Yeah, and it's marvelous
How we can ever make it through
Sometimes I wonder
How we can ever make it at all

Thanks for the information
Subliminal dummy tech or MTV
And with her everything light becomes heavy
And everything heavy becomes light
Ah, they took me down to the watering hole
Because I happened to mention I was dying of thirst
Then they told me he who believes first will be later
And he who heads later will be first

(And it's wonderful) And it's wonderful
(Marvelous) Baby, and it's marvelous
How we can ever make it through, yeah
Sometimes I wonder
How we can ever make it at all

Thanks for the information
Oh never give a sucker an even break
When you're on to something it's a dime in a dozen
People start coming out of the woodwork
Thanks for the invitation
I know I must be on to something big
Every time I take two steps forward
I end up having to take three back
Wonderful (And it's wonderful)
And it's marvelous (Marvelous)
How we can ever make it through
Sometimes I wonder
If we can ever make it at all

Thanks for the information
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Every time I'm ready for a major breakthrough
I always have to think in terms of better or worse
Thanks for the information
Thanks for the memory
Thanks for the information
Thanks for the memoryEmbed
