Here Comes the Knight Lyrics
On the road with my sword
And my shield in my hand
Pressing on to the new day

This love will surely last forever
This love will surely last always

In the valley I see horsemen pass
Baby, baby, baby, baby, they don't want this love to last
There's a battle for the throne
And it's raging down in your soul
It says

This love will surely last forever
This love will surely last always
This love will surely last forever
This love will surely last always

Been accused of truth and alchemy
Been accused of speaking out for freedom too
I gave a demonstration in front of a crowd
A man saw my hands and he began to shout
Here come, here come, here come horsemen through the pass
They say cast a cold eye on life on death
There's a battle for the truth
And it means to thine own self be true
It goes

This love will surely last forever and ever, baby
This love will surely last always
Oh this love, this love will surely last forever and ever
Oh this love will surely last always

Forever and ever, forever and ever, and ever and ever
(This love will surely last forever
This love will surely last always
This love will surely last forever)Embed
