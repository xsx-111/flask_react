Talk to Me LyricsWhen we've all outsold our worth
We'll come crashing down to Earth
Before the time being it's fine
So lets make full use of our time
So will you just
Talk to me
When you talk the rain stops falling
Talk to me
When you talk the rain stops falling
Falling
Talk to me
When you talk the rain stops falling
FallingEmbed
