Cloudburn Lyrics
Never see the sky
You live in the void
Never go outside
'Cause you're paranoid
Cloud burning bright
The burn feels so good
Cloud burning bright


Never see the sky
You live in the void
Never go outside
'Cause you're paranoid
Cloud burning bright
The burn feels so good
Cloud burning bright


Never see the sky
You live in the void
Never go outside
'Cause you're paranoid
Cloud burning bright
The burn feels so good
Cloud burning bright
