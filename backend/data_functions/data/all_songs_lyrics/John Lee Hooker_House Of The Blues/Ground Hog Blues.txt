Ground Hog Blues LyricsIt's a low-down dog, a dirty Groundhog that rootin' round my in back door
Yes if I catch him there rootin' there , Lord, he won't root there no more
Yes he stand and he watch me, in the morning when I leave home
Yes he stand and he watch me, Lord, in the morning when I leave home
Then when I leave home in the morning, yes, he hangs around all day long
Give me some toads'n' frogs' hips
I'm gonna, gonna, put it all together
I'm gonna, gonna mix it up together
I'm gonna, gonna whup it all up good
I'm gonna, gonna kill that ol' dirty Groundhog
I bet'cha my bottom dollar then man, he, he won't root there no more

Na he ain't gonna root no more there
I said goodbye baby, Lord, I'm leavin' you now
I said goodbye baby, Lord, I'm leavin' you now
I done did what I want to done, killed that dirty ground hog

Yes he's through!Embed
