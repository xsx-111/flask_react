Louise LyricsLouise, you the sweetest gal I know
Louise, you the sweetest gal I know
Yeah, you made me walk from Chicago, baby
Down to the Gulf of Mexico
Now, look a-here, Louise
Now, what you tryin' to do?
You tryin' to make me love you
And you love some other man too
Whoa Louise, baby that will never do
Yeah, you know you can't love Big Bill, baby
And love some other man too
Louise, I believe
Somebody been fishin' in my pond
They been catchin' all my perches
Grinding up the bone
Whoa Louise, baby why don't you hurry home?
Yeah you know, you know, Louise
I ain't had no lovin', not since you been gone
Louise, you know you got ways
Like a rattlesnake and a squirrel
Now, when you start the lovin'
I declare, it's out of this world
Whoa Louise, baby, why don't you hurry home?
Yes, I ain't had no lovin' baby
Not since my Louise been gone
Louise, the big boat's up the river
Now she's on a bag of sand
Now she don't strike deep water
I declare she'll never land
Whoa Louise, baby why don't you hurry home?
Yeah you know, you know Louise
I ain't had no lovin', not since you been goneEmbed
