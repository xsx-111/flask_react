Union Station Blues LyricsI went to Union Station this morning
When my baby got on board
Lord I was down there trying
When my baby sat way down inside
People I was standing there crying this morning
When my baby sat way down inside
Lord all my heart was hurting for me
People I just couldn't keep from crying
Lord you know how I feel
I feel gone down the line
She left this morning
He said man, don't worry
There'll be another train going the same old way, mmm, mmm
He said man, please don't worry
There'll be a train going the same old way, mmm
Well I found my baby
Man, some old lonesome day
You may go away baby
Lord, but you will be coming back, mmm
I was standing here when you left me, baby
I'll be here when you come back againEmbed
