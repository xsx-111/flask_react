Leave My Wife Alone LyricsHey man! Leave my wife alone!
I done told you once and ain't gonna tell you no more
Next time I tell I'm gonna mow you down
I said leave her alone, I said leave her alone
I said man don't you know leave my wife alone
I said look at her babe what have you dun-done?
Got my lover got her on her thumb
Better leave him alone, better leave him alone
I done told you once ain't gonna tell you no more
Oh!
Have mercy!
I said look at her babe what you dun-done?
Got my lover got her on her thumb
I done told you baby, done told you baby
I done told you baby, leave that man alone
De lata de lata de lata do
I said baby now baby leave that man aloneEmbed
