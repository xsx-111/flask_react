Love Blues LyricsOh, baby, nobody move me the way you do
Oh, baby, nobody move me the way you do
When you look into my eyes baby
Oh, baby chills me through and through
Oh, baby, baby, nobody move me the way you do
Oh, wee baby, nobody move me the way you do
When I look into your eyes baby
Baby you know it chills me through and through
Oh, baby, oh baby
Oh, baby, oh baby
Lord, it chills me baby
Well, well, baby, chill
Baby, chilled me through and through
Every time, you, you, you, hug and kiss me darling
Hug and kiss me darling
Yes, yes, yes
Well, well, well, well, well, well baby
God knows, I get ideas
Nobody move me baby
Nobody move me baby
Nobody move me the way you do
Oh, baby, you gonna leave me baby
You gonna leave me baby
Please, please, please, baby
Baby, please, don't leave me crying
