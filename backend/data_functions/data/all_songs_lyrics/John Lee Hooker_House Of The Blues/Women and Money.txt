Women and Money LyricsWhiskey and women almost wrecked my life
Whiskey and women almost wrecked my life
Got me to the point today, got nowhere to lay my head
Yea women, go from man to man
Yea women, go from man to man
I said money, go from hand to hand
Ooh, look what a shape I'm In
Ooh, Lord, look what a shape I'm In
I done lost everything, everything but my mind
I had money, and women on the other hand
Oh, I had money people, and women on the other hand
, my money passed to another hand
Ooh, wee, got no money now
My money gone, my baby gone to another man!Embed
