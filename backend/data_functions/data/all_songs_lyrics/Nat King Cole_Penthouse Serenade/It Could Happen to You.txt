It Could Happen to You LyricsHide your heart from sight
Lock your dreams at night
It could happen to you
Don't count stars
Or you might stumble
Someone drops a sigh
And down you tumble
Keep an eye on spring
Run when church bells ring
It could happen to you
All I did was wonder
How your arms would be
And it happened to meEmbed
