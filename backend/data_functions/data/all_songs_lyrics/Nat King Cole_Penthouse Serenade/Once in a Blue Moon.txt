Once in a Blue Moon LyricsThe room is empty
The lights are dim
And my heart wonders
If I'll ever see you again
My tears are hungry
For an open door
When your arms held me
I never felt that way before
I'll be waiting
I'll be watching
Under a blue moon
The taste of heaven
Only happens
Once in a blue moon
Once in a blue moon
Do you remember
When the wind blew free
And we fit together
So naturally
If the wind closes a door
It will open anotherEmbed
