Jesus Is Here Today LyricsLet us pray pray pray
Pray pray pray
And give thanks unto the Lord
We're going to glory
We'll fall down on our knees
Coz Jesus is here to stay
Let us pray pray pray
Pray pray pray
And give thanks unto the Lord
We're going to glory
We'll fall down on our knees
Coz Jesus is here to stay
Let us sing sing sing...
Sing sing sing
For I know he's here to stay
I can feel him in my soul
Coz he has made me whole
And Jesus is here to stay
Let us shout shout shout
Shout shout shout
Let the world know just what it's all about
He rose from the grave
My soul he has saved
Because Jesus is here to stay
Let us march march march...
March march march
To the alter of the Lord
We'll sing his praises aloud
And shout, shout with the crowd
Coz Jesus is here to stay
Let us pray pray pray
Pray pray pray
And give thanks unto the Lord
We're going to glory
We'll fall down on our knees
Coz Jesus is here to stayEmbed
