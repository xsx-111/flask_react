My journey to the sky LyricsOne perfect morning
I was all alone
Listening to
The blaze of summer
Drifting, I was falling
I was floating in a golden haze
Breathing in the sky blue sounds
Of memories of other days
And in my dreams I was a child
Flowers in my mouth and in my eyes
And I was floating through the colors of a sky
Up to the stars and angels
Up, up, up to Heaven
Up, up, up forever
Up, up, up to Heaven
Up, up, up forever
Turning in my climb
I looked down on a lake
Traced upon the water
There I saw your face
Sang in recollection
Of the times we shared
Then pushed on ever upward
To the sky
And in my dreams I was a child
Flowers in my mouth and in my eyes
And I was floating through the colors of a sky
Up to the stars and angels
Up, up, up to Heaven
Up, up, up forever
Up, up, up to Heaven
Up, up, up foreverEmbed
