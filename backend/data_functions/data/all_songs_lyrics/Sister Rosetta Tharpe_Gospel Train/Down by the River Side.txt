Down by the River Side LyricsI feel so bad in the morning
I feel so bad in the middle of the day
I feel so bad in the evening
That's why i'm going to the river, to wash my sins away

I'm gonna lay down my heavy load, down by the riverside
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
I'm gonna lay down my heavy load, down by the riverside
I'm gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I
Ain't a gonna study war no more
Well, I'm gonna put on my long white robe
(Where?) down by the riverside (Oh)
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
I'm gonna put on my long white robe
(Where?) down by the riverside
I'm gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
Well, I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield
(Where?) down by the riverside
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield
(A-ha) down by the riverside
I'm gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no moreEmbed
