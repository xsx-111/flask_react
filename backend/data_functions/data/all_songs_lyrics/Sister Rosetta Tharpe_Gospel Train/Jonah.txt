Jonah LyricsIn the Bible we are told
Of a prophet who was called
To a city that was steeped in awful sin
All the people in that place
Were devoid of saving grace
And the prophet seemed afraid to enter in
Over there, over there
In that land bright and fair
Oh, he'll tell me all about it over there
On the hallelujah strand
I'll take Jonah by the hand
And he'll tell me all about it over there
Then this prophet forth was sent
That old Nineveh might repent
But instead of that to Tarshish he set sail
Oh! the winds began to blow
Overboard did Jonah go
And he found a mercy seat inside the whale
Over there, over there
In that land bright and fair
Oh, he'll tell me all about it over there
On the hallelujah strand
I'll take Jonah by the hand
And he'll tell me all about it over there
In the cold and briny deep
Tears of grief did Jonah weep
And the big fish threw him out upon the shore
Then he gladly went his way
Preached to Nineveh night and day
And he did not care to backslide any more
Over there, over there
In that land bright and fair
Oh, he'll tell me all about it over there
On the hallelujah strand
I'll take Jonah by the hand
And he'll tell me all about it over there
Oh, some people don't believe
That a whale could him receive
But that does not make my song at all untrue
There are whales on every side
With their big mouths open wideâ€”
Just take care, my friend, or one will swallow you
Over there, over there
In that land bright and fair
Oh, he'll tell me all about it over there
On the hallelujah strand
I'll take Jonah by the hand
And he'll tell me all about it over there
Many souls are tossed about
By the whales of fear and doubt
But the Savior wants to take them by the hand
If they will His voice obey
He will save them right away
And will guide them safely to the promised land
Over there, over there
In that land bright and fair
Oh, he'll tell me all about it over there
On the hallelujah strand
I'll take Jonah by the hand
And he'll tell me all about it over thereEmbed
