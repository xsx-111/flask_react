Strange Things Happening Every Day LyricsOh, we hear church people say
They are in this holy way
There are strange things happening every day
On that last great judgment day
When they drive them all away
There are strange things happening every day
Every day
(Every day)
Every day
(Every day)
There are strange things happening every day
Every day
(Every day)
Every day
(Every day)
There are strange things happening every day
If you want to view the climb
You must learn to quit your lyin'
There are strange things happening every day
If you hew right to the line
You can live right all the time
There are strange things happening every day
Every day
(Every day)
Every day
(Every day)
There are strange things happening every day
Every day
(Every day)
Every day
(Every day)
There are strange things happening every day
Jesus is the holy life
Turning darkness into light
There are strange things happening every day
He gave the blind man sight
Then he praised Him with all his might
There are strange things happening every day
Every day
(Every day)
Every day
(Every day)
There are strange things happening every day
Every day
(Every day)
Every day
(Every day)
There are strange things happening every dayEmbed
