How Far from God LyricsWell I look down the road and I wondered
Yes, I wondered, oh Lord, I wondered
I look down the road and I wondered
Just to see how far, see how far I was from God
And I buckled up my shoes and then I started walking
And I started walking, oh, I started walking
I just buckled up my shoes and I started walking
Just to see how far I was from God
Now I used to, used to have some playmates
I used to have, use to have some playmates
I used to have some playmates
To walk and talk, walk and talk with me
But ever since I, since I received a blessing
Oh, I received a blessing, I received a blessing
Ever since I received a blessing
Oh, my so called friends, they turned their back on me
I look down the road, look down the road and I wondered
Oh yes, I wondered, oh yes, I wondered
I look, I look, I look down the road and I wondered
I wondered to see how far, how far that I was, was from God
One more time
Oh, and I wondered, oh, I wondered
I wondered, oh, I wondered
Just to see how far I was from GodEmbed
