This Train LyricsThis train is a clean train, you know, this train
This train is a clean train, I said, this train
This train is a clean train, everybody riding in Jesus' name
This train is a clean train, I said, this train
This train has left the station, you know, this train
This train has left the station, I said, this train
This train has left the station and this train takes on every nation
'Cause this train is a clean train, I said, this train
It's the prettiest train I ever have seen, this train
It's the prettiest train I ever have seen, oh, this train
It's the prettiest train I ever have seen
But if you want to ride it, you better get redeemed
'Cause this train is a clean train, I said, this train
Hey, this train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory, I said, this train
Hey, this train is bound for glory, everybody riding her must be holy
'Cause this train is a clean train, I said, this train
Hey, this train don't pull no jokers, I said, this train
This train don't pull no jokers, ah, ah, this train
Hey, this train don't pull no jokers
No tobacco chewers and no cigar smokers
'Cause this train is a clean train, I said, this train
This train is a clean train, I said, this train
This train is a clean train, I said, this train
This train is a clean train, everybody's riding in Jesus' name
'Cause this train is a clean train, I said, this train
Hey, this train is a clean train, I said, this trainEmbed
