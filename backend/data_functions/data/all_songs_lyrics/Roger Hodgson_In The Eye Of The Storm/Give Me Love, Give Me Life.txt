Give Me Love, Give Me Life LyricsIt's feeling like it's time to ring the changes
It's feeling like it's time to be reborn
'Cause here we go again, proclaiming it's the end
We're reaching out for something to bring it back again
We're living on good fortune, we're cheating all our friends
So tell me, oh tell me, now where's it going to end
I hope it's not too late to see the danger
I'd really like to wake and see the dawn
'Cause here we go again, we're trying to pretend
We're blaming one another for what is ours to mend
We're fighting for the future, we're ringin' out the past
It feels good, it feels good but is it going to last
Chorus:
Give me love, give me love, give me joy, give me pain
Give me light, give me starting again
Give me hope, give me hope, give me sun, give me rain
Get me up, get me dancing again
Give me life, give me life, give me high, give me low
Give me truth give me something to know
Give me time, give me time, give me room, give me rope
Give me sign, give me reason to hope
'Cause everything is a turn up, turnaround
And everything is upside, upside-down
Well everything's not like you'd like it to be
Everything is a two-bit, two-bit town
And everybody's just out to drag you down
Well nothing is as you'd like it, like it to be
Well everything is a turn up, turnaround
And everything is upside, upside-down
Well everything's not like you'd like it to be
Everything is a two-bit, two-bit town
And everybody's just out to drag you down
Well nothing is as you'd like it, like it to be
I may not love you, but I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Repeat Chorus
Things just ain't what they used to be, ain't what they ought to be
Ain't what they've got to be, gonna be probably
Things just ain't gonna get to me, ain't gonna bother me
Ain't gonna worry me, hurry me, let it be
Repeat Chorus'Embed
