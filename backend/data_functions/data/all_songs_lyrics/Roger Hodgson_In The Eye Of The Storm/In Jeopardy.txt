In Jeopardy LyricsIn jeopardy, in jeopardy, I feel I'm about to cry
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, oh tell me the reason why
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, I'm watching the feeling grow
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, oh tell me I want to know
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, the writing is on the wall
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, I can't seem to sleep at all
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, we utter a lonely cry
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, who cares if we live or die
Chorus:
Who's in your mind, who's in your conscience
Part of the crime, part of the nonsense
Do what we can, pray for tomorrow
Living our lives, watching, waiting, feeling as much as we can
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, so where is the golden age
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, we're ready to turn the page
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, it's getting so out of hand
In jeopardy, in jeopardy, I wish I could understand
Repeat Chorus
Who's in your mind, who's in your conscience
Part of the crime, part of the nonsense
Do what we can, pray for tomorrow
Living our lives, watching, waiting, working, playing
Singing, dancing, running as fast as we can'Embed
