Lovers in the Wind Lyrics
Time is always on the run
We've only just begun
Lovers in the wind

Life is all we have to share
You know we must take care
Lovers in the wind

There was a time, when it was hard to know
Reaching out, reaching out for somewhere to go
There was a light born on the darkest day
But no one wants to know, and no one wants to try

Love is all I have to give
It's all I need to live
Lovers in the wind

There was a time, when it was hard to know
Reaching out, reaching out for somewhere to go
There was a light born on the darkest day
But no one wants to know, and no one wants to cry
Time is always on the run
We've only just begun
Lovers in the wind1Embed
