Hooked on a Problem LyricsI'm hooked on a problem, it won't go away
So many opinions, I don't know what to say
Can somebody help me, what they trying to do
Life used to be simple, life used to be fun
But it's all catching up on me, tell me what have I done
Can somebody help me, what they trying to do
Chorus:
Hey don't you ever get lonely, hey don't you wish it was easy
Facing the world on your own
I'm hooked on a problem, it won't let me go
The way people look at me feels like twenty below
Can somebody help me, what they trying to do
I'm walking a tightrope with stars in my eyes
In danger of falling, won't you kiss me goodbye
Can somebody help me, what they trying to do
Repeat Chorus
If you know the answer, what I'm tryin' to say
I need a solution, 'cause I'm wasting away
Can somebody help me, what they trying to do
Won't somebody help me, what they trying to do
Can somebody help me, what they trying to do'Embed
