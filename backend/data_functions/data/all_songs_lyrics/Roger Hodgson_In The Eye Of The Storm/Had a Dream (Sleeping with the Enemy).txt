Had a Dream (Sleeping with the Enemy) Lyrics
"No no no no no! Just do as you're told!"
"Used to be such a nice boy"

Yeah!

Had a dream, I was born
To be naked in the eye of the storm
And now it's standing right in front of me
What's it going to do to me? Who knows?
Had a dream, it was time
To be taken to the front of the line
Well, that is not a place you wanna be
Sleeping with the enemy, you know

I don't care what the future brings
Give a damn about anything
I'd be fine if they'd only leave me alone
But it's time, gotta take a stance
'Cause I won't get a second chance
And I know now I have to make it alone
Yeah! 

Had a dream it was war
And they couldn't tell me what it was for
But it was something they could lie about
Something we could die about, you know
Anytime, anyplace
When you look that man in the face
Well, it is not a face you wanna see
Sleeping with the enemy, you know


Mary, can you hear me? Can you tell me what it's all supposed to mean?
Holding out a photograph of all that I have seen
I wish I could hold you, I wish I could hold you
Hey!

Had a dream, it was time
To be a witness at the scene of the crime
Well, that is something you can analyze
Something you can criticize, who knows?
So we wait, hesitate
And we're making such a mistake
Oh, whatever can the matter be?
Sleeping with the enemy you know
I don't care what the future brings
Give a damn about anything
I'd be fine if they'd only leave me alone
But it's time, gotta take a stance
'Cause I won't get a second chance
And I know now I have to make it alone
Yeah!
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
But you wanna know
Whoo!
Ooo yeah
Woo!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woo!
Oh, yeah
All right, all right, all right, yeah
Woo!Embed
