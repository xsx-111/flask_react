Trip to the Fair LyricsI took a trip down to look at the fair
When I arrived I found nobody there
It seemed I was all alone
Must be that they've all gone home
A trip to the fair, but nobody was there
A trip to the fair, but nobody was there
Voices of yesterday make not a sound
Even the roundabout stopped going round
I wonder just what it means
Is everything how it seems?
A trip to the fair, but nobody was there
A trip to the fair, but nobody was there
A creak as the dodgems came onto the scene
Wheels began turning I started to scream
A carousel swung around
My head spun and hit the ground
A trip to the fair, but nobody was there
A trip to the fair, but nobody was there
I close my eyes to disguise the fear from inside
Trembling within my own mind I find no place to hide
Stars of tomorrow shine through the grey mist that has gone
I wish that this trip to the fair had never begun
Suddenly thousands of faces I see
Everyone seemed to be staring at me
Clowns laughed in the penny arcade
What was this game my mind played?
I took a trip down to look at the fair
When I arrived I found nobody there
It seemed I was all alone
Must be that they've all gone home
A trip to the fair but nobody was there, but nobody was there
A trip to the fair but nobody was there, but nobody was there1Embed
