Disappointed (Live) Lyrics
Our unsleepable friend
Gets the message on an ill-wind
All your friends and your foes
Would rather die than have to touch you
To say the least, truly disappointed
Truly, truly, ah-ha-ha

I've drank too much
And I've said too much
And there's nowhere to go, but down
Young boy - I wanna help you
? see these lines? I'm truly disappointed
Truly, truly

Don't talk to me now
About people who are nice
'Cause I have spent my whole life
In ruins...
Because of people who were nice
Oh, this world it may lack style, I know
But each bud must blossom and grow

Young girl one day we really will be old
But the thing is, I love you now
This is the last song I will ever sing (NO!)
Ahhh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Goodnight
And thank you (Morrissey!)Embed
