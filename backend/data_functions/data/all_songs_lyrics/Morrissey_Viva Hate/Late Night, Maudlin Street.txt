Late Night, Maudlin Street Lyrics
Winter coming
Winter push on (push on)
Oh, winter push on
Winter is so long
Winter moves on

The last night on Maudlin Street
Goodbye house
Goodbye stairs
I was born here
And I was raised here
And I took some stick here
Love at first sight
May sound trite
But it's true, you know
I could list the details
Of everything you ever wore
Or said, or how you stood the day
And as we spend the last night
On Maudlin Street
"Goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
Around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
Became what you see
Here I amâ€”the ugliest man
It's the last night on Maudlin Street
And truly I do love you
Oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
You framed beside my bed
Oh, it's childish and it's silly
But I think it's you in my room
By the bed
Yes, I told you it was silly
And I know I took strange pills
But I never meant to hurt you
Oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
Everyone had gone to bed
Nobody stays up for you
I had sixteen stitches
All around my head
The last bus I missed to Maudlin Street
So, he drove me home in the van
Complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
Don't leave your torch behind
A power cut ahead
1972, you know
And so we crept through the park
But no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
Off a clothesline for you
But you without clothes
Oh I could not keep a straight face
Me without clothes?
Well a nation turns its back and gags
I'm packed
I am moving house
A half-life disappears today
Every hag waves me on
Secretly wishing me gone
Well, I will be soon
Oh I will be soon
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
They took you away in a police car
Dear Inspector, don't you know?
Don't you care?
Don't you know about love?
Your gran died
And your mother died
On Maudlin Street
In pain and ashamed
With never time to say
Those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
Well, it's only bricks and mortar!
And... truly I do love you
Wherever you are
Wherever you are2Embed
