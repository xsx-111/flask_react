Bengali in Platforms Lyrics
Bengali, Bengali
Bengali, Bengali
No, no, no
He does not want to depress you
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
He only wants to impress you
Oh...
Bengali in platforms
He only wants to embrace your culture
And to be your friend forever
Forever (forever)

Bengali, Bengali
Bengali, Bengali
Oh, shelve your Western plans
And understand
'Cause life is hard enough when you belong here

A silver-studded rim that glistens
And an ankle-star that blinds me
A lemon sole so very high
Which only reminds me - to tell you
Break the news gently
Break the news to him gently
"Shelve your plans, shelve your plans, shelve them"
Bengali, Bengali
It's the touchy march of time that binds you
Don't blame me
Don't hate me
Just because I am the one to tell you
That life is hard enough when you belong here
That life is hard enough when you belong here

Oh...
Shelve your Western plans
Oh...
Shelve your Western plans

'Cause life is hard enough when you belong
Life is hard enough when you belong here
Oh...
Shelve your Western plans
Oh...
Shelve your best friends
'Cause life is hard when you belong here
Oh...
Life is hard enough when you belongEmbed
