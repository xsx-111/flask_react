Alsatian Cousin Lyrics
Were you and he lovers?
And would you say so if you were?
On a forecourt
On a Friday
Passing my way

Were you and he lovers?
And if you were, then say that you were!
On a groundsheet
Under canvas
With your tent-flap
Open wide

A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring me home and have me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
Oh!
Is that the best you can do?

So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
"Were you and he lovers?"3Embed
