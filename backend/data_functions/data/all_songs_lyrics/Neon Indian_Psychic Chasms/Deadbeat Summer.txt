Deadbeat Summer Lyrics
Going blind from the heat
In the middle of a sunlit street
Seeing thoughts on repeat
But I'd rather get something to eat
Feeling senseless and beat
And I wonder at the chance that we'll meet

Deadbeat summer
It's just a deadbeat summer
Deadbeat summer
It's just a deadbeat summer
Deadbeat summer
It's just a deadbeat summer
Deadbeat summer
It's just a deadbeat summer

You're the one that I miss
From last summer when I'd stolen a kiss
Hear the endless hiss
As it rolls into the starlit abyss
All my dreams reminisce
Never thought this time it'd be like this
Deadbeat summer
It's just a deadbeat summer
Deadbeat summer
It's just a deadbeat summer
Deadbeat summer
It's just a deadbeat summer
Deadbeat summer
It's just a deadbeat summer7Embed
