Ephemeral Artery Lyrics
Seeming stripped of all the faults that you've assessed
You're possessed
To impress
Jilted facades are a losing game at best
Your shadowed face
Scattered hands
Timid shrugs still displaced

Let it spill onto the street
Either way we're incomplete (ah)
You know it doesn't hurt to cheat
Hurt to cheat
Hurt to cheat
Hurt to cheat
Hurt to cheat (ah)

Broken mirror shards laid out and rearranged
Still the same
Just reframed
Inverse reflection you're expecting to receive
But whom you seek
Doesn't ring
Any bells so to speak
Let it spill onto the street
Either way we're incomplete (ah)
You know it doesn't hurt to cheat
Hurt to cheat
Hurt to cheat
Hurt to cheat
Hurt to cheat (ah)

Let it spill onto the street
Either way we're incomplete (ah)
And I'd rather be obsolete
Than complete
Than complete
Than complete
Than complete
Than completeEmbed
