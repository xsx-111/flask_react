Should Have Taken Acid with You Lyrics
Should have taken acid with you
Touch the stars and the planets too
Should have taken acid with you
Melt our tongues and become unglued
Should have taken acid with you
Touch the stars and the planets too
Should have taken acid with you
Melt our tongues and become unglued

Should have taken acid with you
Take our clothes off in the swimming pool
Should have taken acid with you
Told my parents that I'm staying with you
Should have taken acid with you
Take our clothes off in the swimming pool
Should have taken acid with you
Told my parents that I'm staying with you12Embed
