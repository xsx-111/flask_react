Psychic Chasms Lyrics
Mind waves rolling through, carry me far into the tide
Where all my thoughts are found
Colored haze slowly looms, piercing through like sulfur fumes
While I'm just contemplating sounds

Distant looks from your face, take me to another place and time
Where we were never found
Night drains just to wake in the end, it's always fake
And all your thoughts been left to drown2Embed
