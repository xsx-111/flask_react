Terminally Chill Lyrics
Fast asleep she's been waiting to creep for a long time
Faint lit eyes slowly swallowing vibes from the waistline
Only dreams can deliver these things to my bedside
Airy shrugs says she's pulling the plugs to the outside

Lengthy days in a lovesick haze chemical fire
Lofty phase pulling minimum wage fans the desire
Lucid nights bring her perfumed sight to admire
All in all moments to recall and retire8Embed
