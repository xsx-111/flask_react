Pray Lyrics
We pray, pray for the light to reign
We call, we call the day
We rise, pray for the wind to blow
We know, we know the way

No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive
No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive

We pray, pray for the light to reign
We call, we call the day

No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive
No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive

Go, go, go

We rise, pray for the wind to blow
