Goodbye Baby (Baby Goodbye) Lyrics
Goodbye baby
So long girl
I know you ain't gonna like it
But I'm stepping right out in your world
For I'm coming to your party
And I won't be able to stay but I'm gonna
Kiss you one more time, Lord
Then I'm going away

(Goodbye baby)
Hmm
(Baby goodbye)
Hmm

You may be lonely
Yeah, you may be hurt
Like a fool I gave you candy
You turned around and treated me like dirt
But still I'm gonna come to your party
And just before the break of day
I'm gonna touch you
One more time, Lord
Then I'm going away
Sing it to me again
(Goodbye baby)
Hmm
(Baby goodbye)
Hmm

Look out, what you see?
I see a train a-coming
A train a-coming down the long lonesome track
I'll tell you, girl, I gotta go on home now
But deep down in your heart
You know that someday I'm, I'm coming back
And I'm gonna look for you
At your party
'Cause all the time I know that I'll find you there
And listen, I'm gonna dance with you
One more time
Oh, oh oh yeah
Sing it to me tonight now

(Goodbye baby)
Sing it sweet
(Baby goodbye)
Lord, you're singing so sweet tonight
(Goodbye baby)
Goodbye baby baby baby baby
(Baby goodbye)
I'll see you around sometime, Lord
(Goodbye baby)
Uh huh, I'll be on my merry way
(Baby goodbye)
Bye bye bye bye byeEmbed
