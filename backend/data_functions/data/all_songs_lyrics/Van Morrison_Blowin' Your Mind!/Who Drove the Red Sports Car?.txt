Who Drove the Red Sports Car? Lyrics
Who drove the red sports car from the mansion
And laid upon the grass in summer time?
And who done me out high time fashion
And made me read between the lines?
And who said, "Follow the mind, it's your only chance
Sit on your throne
You got to make it on your own, on your own"?

And who said, "Ha, ha, look at you, look at you
You got jam on your face."
And who did your homework and read your Bible
And signed your name every place?
And who said, "Fortunes untold lie, don't go by gold
You're much better known, you got to make it on your own
On your own." Ah, ah, uh-huh

And do you remember, do you remember this time
I said a long time ago when I came walkin' down
I came walkin' down, ha, by Maggie's place, ha ha ha
It started comin' on rain, huh, it started comin' on rain

Cause I had nothing on but a shirt and a pair of pants
And I was getting wet, I was getting wet
Saturated, saturated, baby
And Maggie opened up the window
And Jane swung out her right arm
She said, "Hi!" I said. "Hi, how're you doing, baby?"
She said, "Come on in out the rain, come on in out the rain
Lord, come on in out the rain, sit down by the fireside
And dry yourself." Achoo, do it, do it, a-ha ha ha, I got caught
I got caught An I got, got a bag, got a bag, baby, oh Lord
I said, "I don't mind if I do, I don't mind if I do." Ha, aah...
Haa, it's a bag
I mean, huh, you know you gotta
You know, you sort-a turn it upside down
Somethin' like, put it on a rack
Fold it n', press it 'n
(Fades)
Call it a record or somethin' like that goin'
You guys have got a sure thing...Embed
