Midnight Special LyricsWell you wake up in the mornin'
When the ding-dong ring (ding 'em man, ding 'em)
Go over to the table
Ya see the same old (damn) thing
Knife n' fork upon the table
And nothin' in my pan
Say anything about it
A-get in trouble with the man
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine an ever lovin' light on me
If you ever go to Houston
Boy, ya better walk right
You better not stagger
And you better not fight
Or the sheriff gon' arrest you
Lord, and carry you down
And if the jury find your guilty
You're penitentiary bound
But let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine an ever lovin' light on me
Let the midnight special (hoo)
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine an ever lovin' light on me
Yonder comes Miss Rosie (yeah) (oh yeah)
How in the world do you know? (how do ya know?)
Well, I know her by her apron (oh yeah)
And the dress she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder
Piece a-paper in her hand (yeah)
She's a-gonna tell the (my) Captain
To let loose (release) her man
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine an ever lovin' light on me
(Me, me, me)
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Well let the midnight special
Shine an ever lovin' light on me
Well I done my time, boy (well, yeah)
Hoot n' holler n' cryin'
Well the man are call me
An I'll be ridin' down the line
But let the midnight special (Lord)
Shine a light on me (yeah)
A-let the midnight special
Shine it's ever lovin' light on meEmbed
