Spanish Rose LyricsThe wine beneath the bed
The things we've done and said
And all the mem'ries
That come glancing back to me
In my loneliness
You're standing in the bridge
Beyond that stretch but our love reach
And consciousness has found me sometimes wondering
Where you're at
Umm, take me back again
Take me back one more time, Spanish rose
The way ya pulled the gate
Behind you when you said, "It ain't too late
Come on, let's swing the town and have a
Ball tonight
Yeah, hopin' you'd come through
And many others, too
And all the friends we used to have in days gone by
I'm wondering
If you'll take me back again
Take me back one more time, Spanish rose
And when the lights went out there
No one was about
And all the country in full bloom
In the room we danced
And many hearts were torn
And when the word went 'round
That ev'rything was wrong
And just couldn't be put right, it
Tore me up, it tore me up, Lord
In slumber you did sleep
The window I did creep
And touch your raven hair
And sang that song
Again to you
You did not even wince
You thought I was the Prince
To come and take you from your misery
And lonely castle wall
Uhm, take me back again
Ah take me back one more time, Spanish RoseEmbed
