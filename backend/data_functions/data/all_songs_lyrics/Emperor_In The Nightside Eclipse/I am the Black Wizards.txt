I am the Black Wizards LyricsMightiest am I
But I am not alone in this cosmos of mine
For the black hills consist of black souls
Souls that already died one thousand deaths
Behind the stone walls (of centuries) they breed their black art
Boiling their spells in cauldrons of black gold
Far up in the mountains
Where the rain fall not far
Yet the Sun cannot reach
The wizards, my servants
Summon the souls of macrocosm
No age will escape my wrath
I travel through time and I return to the future
I gather wisdom now lost
I visit again the eternally ancient caves
Before a mighty Emperor thereupon came
Watching the mortals "discovering" my chronicles
Guarded by the old demons
Even unknown to me
Once destroyed their souls are being summoned
To my timeless prison of hate
It is delightful to feast upon the screaming souls
That were destroyed in my future
How many wizards that serve me with evil, I know not
My empire has no limits
From the never ending mountains black
To the bottomless lakes
I am the ruler and has been for eternities long
I am them
(I am them.)
(I am them.)
From the never ending mountains black, to the bottomless lakes
I am the ruler and has been for eternities long
My wizards are many, but their essence is mine
Forever they are in the hills in their stone homes of grief
Because I am the spirit of their existence
I am them
I am them
