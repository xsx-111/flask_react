Beyond The Great Vast Forest LyricsBeyond the great vast forest
Surrounded by majestic mountains
Dark rivers float like tears of sorrow
Frost submerge the holy ring of fire
They shall rise again, for they are of Him....
The Dark Lord of eternities
These are the Devils of Darkness
They can not be laid to rest forever
Resurrection... They shall haunt again
"Phantom der nacht", the creatures of the night
Blood is life
Blood is life
Their art of death is infernal
Like their life eternal
See the castle so proud
But yet so grey and cold
Their art of death is infernal
Like their life eternal
See the castle so proud
But yet so grey and cold
Grey and cold
Grey and cold
The frost submerge
The Moon is on the rise
Hear the nocturnal howling of the wolves...
The children of the night
They shall rise again
Resurrected through our gathering of the ancient and evil
They shall rise again, for they are of Him....
The Dark Lord of eternities
These are the Devils of Darkness
They can not be laid to rest forever
Resurrection... They shall haunt again
"Phantom der nacht", the creatures of the night
Blood is life
Blood is life
In the name of the almighty Emperor they shall riseEmbed
