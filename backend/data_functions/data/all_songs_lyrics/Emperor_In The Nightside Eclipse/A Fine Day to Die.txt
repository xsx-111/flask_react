A Fine Day to Die LyricsOrgy of silence, conspiracy of peace
Only the sound of the cold northern breeze
Twinsun sink fading behind the black lake
Asleep is the mountains, yet the night is awake
Strange is the night. Now black stars rise
And many Moons circle through silent the night
Along the black mountainside, scattered
By the campfires awaiting the dawn
Two times a hundred men in battles
Tried by the steel in the arrow, axe and the sword
By battle worn, hunger torn, awaiting
For the Sun to break through the cold haze
And for the banners of Ebal to appear
On the hill in the Sun's first warm rays
The elder among the men looked deep into
The fire and spoke loud with pride
Tomorrow is a fine day to die
(Guitar solo)
Now the morning advance from far East
Now the Sun breaks through dustclouds and haze
Now a forest of spears appears on the hill
And steel shines bright in the Sun's first rays
(Guitar solo)
Die
