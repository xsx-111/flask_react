Towards The Pantheon LyricsMay the wolves start to howl again
May the age of darkness arise
We will travel for eternities
Into the unknown to reach what we seek
Fight the ways through the barriers of light
Through the wastelands
Where nothing but grief have become
The eternal memory
Shield of life
Sword of death
Held up high into the sky
Guided by the shining Moon
In the starry sky above
In the horizon
Beyond black clouds of destruction rages
Like dancing shadows of pain
...of pain
We will grant Him their pain
He will grant us His flame
In flesh and blood
He will arise
To deliver the key
As the armours black robe
Slides across the landscape
We see the land of wisdom
Strength and pure evil...
Darkness, frost, hate...
The throne will be ours
May the wolves start to howl again
May the age of darkness arise
May we touch the black flames
Of the past again and forevermoreEmbed
