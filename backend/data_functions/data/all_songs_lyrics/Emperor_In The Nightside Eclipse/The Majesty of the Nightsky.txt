The Majesty of the Nightsky LyricsLike the tide, shadows flow towards the shore of light
The night comes whirling like a maelstrom
Warring waves of crackling clouds embrace this nightside landscape
The heavens bleed, through open wounds, the dim light of the Moon
The winds are crying mournfully and tears fly with the gusts
They whip my clenched faces freezing skin with ice-cold burning cuts
Too long I have suffered the desert sands of time
But as I drown in darkness it will release the sign
My soul will leave this mortal coil of flesh and earthly life
To fly into the mist of night, into the nightside eclipse
And experience existence on the other side
As a stone of scorching enthusiasm
I refract the reflecting surface of this unfathomable sea
Growing circles of grief and pain slides across the land
As an omen of the horror yet to come
The strength of a thousand fire-breathing demons
Breed in my infernal, sinking soul
And as I reach the surface once again
These powers are under my control
Now I am one with the nightsky majestyEmbed
