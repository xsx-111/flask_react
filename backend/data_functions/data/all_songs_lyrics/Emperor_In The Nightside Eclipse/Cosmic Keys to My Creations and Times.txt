Cosmic Keys to My Creations and Times LyricsThe heavens are lit by the stars
Where years of secrets of universal forces lay hid
They shine so bright, but yet
They have seen more evil than time itself
Reflected in the deepless lakes
(They are drowning in black elements)
They are the planetary keys to unlimited wisdom
And power for the Emperor to obtain
(They) being the gods of the wolves
Whom upon they bark at night
Requesting their next victim in thirst of blood
I enjoy those moments I may haunt with these beasts of the night
What kinds of beings are existing at the deeps of my lakes?
They surely must be of an evil race
For no friendly thing can live
In such depressive waters
(Here is also a planet similar to the Moon, but its phases is only one
And it is in its most powerful for all and ever...
There passes no light without the barking of the wolves.)
All these landscapes are timeless
And this is all just a part of cosmos
(But) all is mine and past and future is yet to discover...
Much have been discovered, but tomorrow
I will realise I existed before myself
I will be reborn
Before I die
I will realise planets ages old
Created by a ruler with a crown of dragon claws
Arrived with a stargate...
A king among the wolves in the night...
An observer of the stars
I will realise planets ages old
Created by a ruler with a crown of dragon claws
Arrived with a stargate...
A king among the wolves in the night...
An observer of the stars
An observer of the stars
An observer of the starsEmbed
