The Burning Shadows of Silence LyricsBenighted darker and darker
As I walk through the woods
Into the silent shadows
As the sky goes from dark to black
Ice cold whispers burns my skin
From nowhere to the deepest of my soul they speak unto me...
Grievance of sadness, like the gift of sorrow
A Moon, a bloodred full Moon lights my black heart's night
Lightning cracks the sky and thunders roll
Through the night a chaos of storms arise
Purgatory
Burning flames catch my eyes
Into the shadows (so dark) I hear the choirs of evil
A "joy" in blasphemy beyond my darkest fantasies
The Gate is open...
Into the silent shadows I crawl
Upon the throne so cold
Atmosphere of melancholy
I will forever burn...
Burn... burn...
Into the silent shadows I crawl
Upon the throne so cold
Atmosphere of melancholy
I will forever burn...
Into the silent shadowsEmbed
