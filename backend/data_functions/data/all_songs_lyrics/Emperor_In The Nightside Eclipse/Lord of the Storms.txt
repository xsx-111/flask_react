Lord of the Storms Lyrics


Earthquakes are breaking the silence
A vision of hate
A wicked, foul spell of evil
Dark winds command the throne
Cleansed by the evil hand
A crusade of the burning land
A servant in the shape of a snake
Blackens the bodies red
Then it appears, the storming wind
A challenging scar burns through the light
A cloud of darkness prepared for me
To complete the circle of death
The serpent gains mastery of the wind
Through the storms and through the streaming snow
Sorrow blackens the Earth when the Moon fades
Dark winds command the throne
Earthquakes are breaking the silence
A vision of hate
A wicked, foul spell of evil
Dark winds command the throne
Cleansed by the evil hand
A crusade of the burning land
An embrace from DeathEmbed
