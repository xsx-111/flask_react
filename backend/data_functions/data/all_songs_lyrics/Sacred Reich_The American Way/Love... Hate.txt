Love... Hate LyricsIn a world so big and cold you seem so all alone
Then someone enters your life and makes it all seem right
Sometimes things do change
Love turns to bitter rage and you say "Never again"
But emotions always mend
It's the root of all disharmony
But it's the need to feel complete
It's a physical attraction
A chemical reaction
A walking contradiction
A push, pull affliction
It's a love...hate relationship
You can see it in our band
We're all so different
Every solution we come to starts with an argument
But through adversity the music's in our heart
We'll stay together you can't tear us apart
It's the root of all disharmony
But it's the need to feel complete
It's a physical attraction
A chemical reaction
A walking contradiction
A push, pull affliction
It's a love...hate relationship
Love...hate is it one in the same
I can't differentiate between love and hate
Love...hate is it one in the same
I can't differentiate between love and hate
I hate to love, I love to hate you love and hate is it one in the
Same love...hate
We always take for granted the one's that we love
We think they'll always be there
And we treat them as such
But if we really make an effort to
Show them that we care
Our love will shine through and the hate will disappear
It's the root of all disharmony
But it's the need to feel complete
It's a physical attraction
A chemical reaction
A walking contradiction
A push, pull affliction
It's a love...hate relationshipEmbed
