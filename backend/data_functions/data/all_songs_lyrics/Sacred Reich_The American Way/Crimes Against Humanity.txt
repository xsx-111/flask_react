Crimes Against Humanity LyricsToxins, pollutants and poisonous gasses
Without notice take their toll on the masses
Air becomes thicker than the water we drink
People unaware of the spread of disease
Smoke fills the sky and the sun disappears
Rain from above is like acid filled tears
The fragile balance of sky and earth has been altered forever
Harmony disturbed
Towering temples of modernization
Megatropolis monument to civilization
Pollution and waste is direct indication
To the growing problem of the world's situation
Smoke fills the sky and the sun disappears
Rain from above is like acid filled tears
The fragile balance of sky and earth has been altered forever
Harmony disturbed
What will it take to make us see
These are crimes against humanity
Not only you, not only me but even our future society
These are crimes against humanity
Pain and suffering are what can be found
Violence and hatred are what abound
Building the weapons that we can't use
Can't we see they have only one use
We need more compassion not more war planes
Are we so blind uncaring insane
Brought into this world with nothing
And with nothing we're destined to depart
What will it take to make us see
These are crimes against humanity
Not only you, not only me but even our future society
These are crimes against humanity
