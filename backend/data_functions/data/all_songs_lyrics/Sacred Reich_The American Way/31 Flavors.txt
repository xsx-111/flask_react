31 Flavors LyricsVanilla is smooth, Chocolate is kickin'
Strawberry is sweet, all deserve a hearty lickin'
Have em all, three scoops piled high
Variety is the spice of life
Well you can have soft serve or hard sugar cones
Root beer floats or my banana split
Do you like nuts or some sticky whip creme
Come lick it off and be my Dairy Queen
I said I love The Chilis, Freaky, Uplift, Mother's Milk
Faith No More, Mike Patton's voice is smooth as silk
Metallica's music makes me want to rage
Sting's lyrics have something to say
Jimi Hendrix plays guitar like no one else
Black Sabbath, Ozzy's voice is sick as hell
Prince, Fishbone, NWA
These are the things that I like to play
Mr. Bungle, is so very cool
So don't be an ignorant fool
There's so much music for you to choose
So don't just be a metal dude
It's cool foolEmbed
