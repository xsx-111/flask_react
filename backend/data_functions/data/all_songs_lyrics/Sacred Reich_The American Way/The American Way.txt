The American Way LyricsTruth and honor faith and pride all convictions surely died
Honesty's time has passed
Time for lies is here at last
Truth is false I'm so fed up
How did we come to be so fucked
Hate fear pain death all our country has got left
Talk to children hear them say daddy left again today
Brother steals and mommy lies
Future lost before their eyes
The sun was lost behind the clouds they rapped it up and blacked it out
Acid rain fell today, it came and washed our hopes away
This was once the land of dreams now these dreams have turned to greed
In the midst of all this wealth the poor are left to help themselves
A capitalist's democracy no one said that freedom's free
Lady Liberty rots away, no truth, no justice the American way
Don't look past your TV
All of us are what we see
A looking glass into our lives
What we watch is what we buy
Priorities are out of whack
Who is next to stab our back
Doesn't it make you mad to have lost all that we've had?
This was once the land of dreams now these dreams have turned to greed
In the midst of all this wealth the poor are left to help themselves
A capitalist's democracy no one said that freedom's free
Lady Liberty rots away, no truth, no justice the American way
Doesn't it fill you with disgust that there's no one left to trust
Is this happening is this real
My body numb I cannot feel
Are you happy are you sad are emotions a thing of the past
I have no tears I cannot cry no one
Mourns for a world that's died
This was once the land of dreams now these dreams have turned to greed
In the midst of all this wealth the poor are left to help themselves
A capitalist's democracy no one said that freedom's free
Lady Liberty rots away, no truth, no justice the American way1Embed
