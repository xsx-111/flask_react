The Way It Is LyricsWe knew your reputation
We hoped that things could be different
But you just proved us wrong
And now you're up to your same old tricks
I guess we learned a lesson that people don't change overnight
Things will work out well
With a little hard work it'll be alright
How could we be so foolish to rush head first, without a thought
I guess it goes to show
If you're unprepared you will be caught
But now we've learned a lesson
A lesson which we won't forget
With our newfound wisdom things'll work out in the end
This is the way it is
Not how things should be
This is the way it is
This is reality
This is the way it is
Not how things should be
This is the way it is
This is reality
You seemed so sincere
We'd work together it'd be lot's of fun
But all you saw was money
It's not the issue 'til the music's done
To you it's doing business
To us it's doing what we love
We'll just do our thing
We won't give in for a buck
This is the way it is
Not how things should be
This is the way it is
This is reality
This is the way it is
Not how things should be
This is the way it is
This is reality
Like a soul attaining heaven we must ascend to greater heights
Got to make a change got to make a change
The time is right now I wish you well
And thank you for what you've done for me
To quote you "Mr. Businessman" there's things in life that aren't free
This is the way it is
Not how things should be
This is the way it is
This is reality
This is the way it is
Not how things should be
This is the way it is
This is realityEmbed
