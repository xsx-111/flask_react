State of Emergency LyricsJailed and beaten, left to die
Political prisoners of apartheid
Youth of the nation violently oppressed
In the quest for freedom thousands dead
How can we let this be
In their country they must be free
When will segregation end
When will the masses be free again
I can't conceive of this injustice
I can't believe it's going on
White man's law is held supreme
Black man have no rights at all
How can we let this be
In their country they must be free
When will segregation end
When will the masses be free again
In this age let's have harmony
All people can be free
This injustice must now end
The masses will be free again
How can we let this be
In their country they must be free
When will segregation end
When will the masses be free again1Embed
