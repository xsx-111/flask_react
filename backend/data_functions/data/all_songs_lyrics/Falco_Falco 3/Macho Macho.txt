Macho Macho Lyrics
That's underground
And fly

Macho Macho
I don't like your style
Macho Macho
You'll be floatin' on the river Nile
Macho Macho
So get down on your knees and pray
Macho Macho
I'm gonna blow your Macho Macho mind away, away
 x2
And the boys are singin'
Na, nana, nana, nana
Hip, hip
Na, nana, nana, nana

So listen
I heard a story the other day
And I've been wonderin' what they got to say
They said, I heard you took ma lady for a ride
I heard it lasted to the morning light
So listen
I am not a violent boy
But you touched my lady and she's my favourite toy
And you're a
Macho Macho
I don't like your style
Macho Macho
You'll be floatin' on the river Nile
Macho Macho
So get down on your knees and pray
Macho Macho
I'm gonna blow your Macho Macho mind away, away
 x2
And the boys are singin'
Na, nana, nana, nana
Hip, hip
Na, nana, nana, nana

Macho Macho
I don't like your style
Macho Macho
You'll be floatin' on the river Nile
Macho Macho
So get down on your knees and pray
Macho Macho
Cause I'm gonna blow your Macho Macho mind away, away
And the boys are singin'
Na, nana, nana, nana
Na, nana, nana, nana
Na, nana, nana, nana
Na, nana, nana, nana

Macho Macho
I don't like your style
Macho Macho
You'll be floatin' on the river Nile
Macho Macho
So get down on your knees and pray
Macho Macho
I'm gonna blow your Macho Macho mind away, away

Macho, Macho
I don't like your style
Macho, Macho
You'll be-
Macho, Macho
Hip, hip
Macho, Macho
Macho, Macho
Hip, hip
Macho, Macho
And the boys are singin'
Hip, hip
And the boys are singin'
Hip, hip
The boys don't sing anymoreEmbed
