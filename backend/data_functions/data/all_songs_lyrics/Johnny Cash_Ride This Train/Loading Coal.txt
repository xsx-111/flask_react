Loading Coal Lyrics
My Pappy said when I was seventeen
"You're six feet tall and your face is clean
And it don't look right for a boy that old
To not make a living loading coal"

Loading coal, loading coal
I'm a double first cousin to a dag-blamed mole
Never get rich for to save my soul
In forty-eleven years of loading coal, loading coal

Ain't never got acquainted with a dollar bill
And I don't ever reckon that I ever will
A dollar isn't made for a fellar I'm told
That scoops up a living loading coal

Loading coal, loading coal
I'm a double first cousin to a dag-blamed mole
Never get rich for to save my soul
In forty-eleven years of loading coal, loading coal

I cussed everything in the mining camp
From a shovel and my pick to my carbide lamp
But I know mighty well till I grow old
I'll still be a-cussing, but loading coal
Loading coal, loading coal
I'm a double first cousin to a dag-blamed mole
Never get rich for to save my soul
In forty-eleven years of loading coal, loading coal

I know just as well as coal is black
One of these days the mines were strike
And I'll sit around starving till I'm finally told
There's a nickel more a ton for loading coal

Loading coal, loading coal
I'm a double first cousin to a dag-blamed mole
Never get rich for to save my soul
In forty-eleven years of loading coal, loading coalEmbed
