Going to Memphis Lyrics
Bring a drink of water, Leroy
Bring a drink of water (no)
If I could get to the mercy man
He'd give me some I know
I got a gal in Vicksburg
Bertha is her name
Wish I was tied to Bertha
Instead of this ball and chain

I'm going to Memphis
That's right Lord, yeah

A dude took all my money
Wouldn't let me see the cards
I owe the boss about a hundred years
For sleeping in his backyard

I'm going to Memphis (yeah Memphis)
Yeah I'm going to Memphis

Like a bitter weed, I'm a bad seed
But when that levee's through and I am too
Let the honky-tonk roll on
Come morning I'll be gone
I'm going to Memphis
Yeah Memphis

I never been to Chicago
But it must be a mighty fine place (that's right)
I couldn't get past Tennessee
With Mississippi all over my face

I'm going to Memphis
(That's right Lord, Memphis)

Well, the freezing ground at night
Is my own folding bed
Poke salad is my bread and meat
And it will be till I'm dead
Well, I brought me a little water
In a Mr. Prince Albert can
But the boss man caught me drinking it
And I believe he broke my hand
They all call me crazy for sassing Mr. Scott
My brother was killed for a deed I did
But I this remember what, yeah
Well another boy is down
The shovel burned him out
Let me stand on his body
To see what the shoutin's about
I'm going to Memphis (yeah Memphis)
Yeah I'm going to Memphis

Like a bitter weed, I'm a bad seed
But when that levee's through and I am too
Let the honky-tonk roll on
Come morning I'll be gone

I'm going to Memphis
Yeah Memphis
(Yes Lord, Memphis-bound)1Embed
