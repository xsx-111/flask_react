Old Doc Brown Lyrics
He was just an old country doctor in a little country town
Fame and fortune had passed him by, though we never saw him frown
As day by day in his kindly way, he'd serve us one and all
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small

Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he would receive a fee
He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he
He had to sell his furniture, couldn't pay his office rent
So to a dusty room over a livery stable, Doc Brown and his satchel went

And on the hitching post at the curb below to advertise his wares
He nailed a little sign that read "Doc Brown has moved upstairs"
One day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door
Old Doc Brown was lying down, but his soul was no more

They found him there in that old black suit, on his face was a smile of content
But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent
So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
Beside each debtor's name old Doc had writ these words "Paid In Full"

Old Doc should've had a funeral fine enough for a king
It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing
'Cept Jones the undertaker, he did mighty well
Donating an old iron casket he had never been able to sell
And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and style
But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile
We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one
Because he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done

We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed his sign
We'd painted it white and to all of us, it certainly did look fine
Now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint
There aren't nothing left but Doc's own sign and that's getting pretty faint

But you can still see that old hitching post, as if an answer to our prayers
Mutely tellin' the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved upstairsEmbed
