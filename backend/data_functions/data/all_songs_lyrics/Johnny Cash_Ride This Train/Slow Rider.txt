Slow Rider Lyrics
I ride an old Paint, he's on the weary side
And I am a saddle tramp about to cross the Great Divide
Where there's grass in the Coulees and water in the drawl
And the forty-pound saddle won't make us both raw

Slow rider, slow rider, move on a little more
The sky boss is waiting at the big ranch house door

I can't help but missing the daughters that I had
One went to Denver, the other went bad
My young wife died in a poolroom fight
But I try to keep singing from morning till night

Slow rider, slow rider, move on a little more
The sky boss is waiting at the big ranch house door

Whenever I die, take my saddle from the wall
Strap it on Snuffy, lead him out of the stall
Throw me on his back and turn him toward the West
He knows how to take me to the spot I love best
Slow rider, slow rider, move on a little more
The sky boss is waiting at the big ranch house doorEmbed
