Boss Jack Lyrics
Pick a lotta cotton, drag a long sack
Coming across the field, well, I see Boss Jack
He's a riding straddle of a single-foot roan
When you know that horse, you'll leave him alone
That ole roan's got green in his eyes
Mean as the devil and twice as wise
A fire in his nose and a bow in his back
Can't nobody ride him but Boss Jack
"Come on children, bend your back
Work a little faster, fill your sack
Then you hitch up the wagon, take it to the gin
Finish picking before the winter sets in"
Now here a while back when the crop was laid by
Remember who took us on a big fish fry?
Caught a heap of catfish, goggle-eye, and carp
Dashed and sang to the guitar and the harp
Well, someday old Boss Jack is going to set us all free
Gabriel's gonna blow for you and me
Angels going to bring that chariot from above
Flapping their wings like a turtle dove
"Come on children, bend your back
Work a little faster, fill your sack
Then you hitch up the wagon, take it to the gin
Finish picking before the winter sets in"Embed
