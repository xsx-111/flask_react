The Fable of Willie Brown LyricsWell I knew a boy named Willie Brown
He was a lover of our town
Wherever he went, the girls fell down
And cried for Willie Brown
Crazy 'bout Willie Brown
Tall and dark and lean and long
Big as a bull and twice as strong
He loved the girls and turned 'em down
A chic was Willie Brown
Dashin' Willie Brown
Well a new girl moved in on our street
We knew that she and Will would meet
But then when we inquired around
She'd not met Willie Brown
She said "Who's Willie Brown?"
The prettiest girl you ever saw
Head to toe without a flaw
When they met one night in town
She fell for Willie Brown
In love with Willie Brown
But the trouble was that we all knew
Willie Brown was fallin' too
Then he announced when June comes 'round
She'll marry Willie Brown
She's in love with Willie Brown
But then the girl denied it all
She said "It's true that I did fall
But he took my love for granted
Now, to heck with Willie Brown
Conceited Willie Brown"
Willie Brown was shocked to learn
That his love had at last been spurn
So on a hill ouside of town
We buried Willie Brown
We buried Willie BrownEmbed
