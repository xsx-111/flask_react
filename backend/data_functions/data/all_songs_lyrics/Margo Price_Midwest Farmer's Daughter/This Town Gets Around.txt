This Town Gets Around Lyrics
In this town everybody's trying
To get a piece of everybody else
It gets hard to tell a real friend from a fake one
So many promises, favors, and lies
Most of the city wears a good disguise
And even I too have been known to wear one

As the saying goes, it's not who you know
But it's who you blow that'll put you in the show
And if that's not the case, I hear you pay 'em
But I don't come easy and I'm flat broke
So I guess it's me who gets the joke
Maybe I'd be smarter if I played dumb

I can't count all the times I've been had
Now I know much better than to let that make me mad
I don't let none of that get me down
From what I've found, this town gets around

Well the very first manager I had
He was old enough he could have been my dad
He took me out for drinks and talked a big talk
He said, "Darling, sign on the dotted line
Kiss my cheek and drink this wine
But if you walk on me, then you can just walk"
I can't count all the times I've been had
Now I know much better than to let that make me mad
I don't let none of that get me down
From what I've found, this town gets around

When I first came here the streets were paved with gold
And you can walk that road, I've been told
But I won't put out or be controlled
I don't write the shit that gets bought and sold
Ask any man, he might know
Who used to live on Music Row
That was then and this is now
And he told me this town gets around
From what I've found this town gets aroundEmbed
