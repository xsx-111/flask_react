Since You Put Me Down LyricsSince you put me down
I've been drinking just to drown
I've been lying through the cracks of my teeth
I've been waltzing with my sin
He's an ugly evil twin
He's a double-crossing, back-stabbing thief
I killed the angel on my shoulder
With a fifth of Evan Williams
When I found out you were never coming home
I killed the angel on my shoulder
Since you left me for another
I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone
No darling, I won't speak your name
I hope that you will do the same
But I pray my voice will haunt you above the ground
And if I see your face again
Don't consider me your friend
You made me feel like an orphan and act like a clown
I killed the angel on my shoulder
With a handle of tequila
So I wouldn't have to spend my nights alone, all alone
I killed the angel on my shoulder
Since you left me for another
I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone
All the vampires at the bar
They won't ever get too far
They're just sucking all of the good blood out of this town
But I'm an outcast and I'm a stray
And I plan to stay that way
Even if I fall from my grace, I'm gonna land back on the ground
Oh, I killed the angel on my shoulder
With a bottle of the Bulleit
So I wouldn't have to hear you bitch and moan, moan, moan
I killed the angel on my shoulder
Since you left me for another
I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone
Said I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone1Embed
