About to Find Out Lyrics
Well I've had about enough of your two-cent words
And the way you're running your mouth
No you haven't got a clue or another thing to do
Except to take another picture of yourself
You're living high on the hog looking down at us all
It may have come so easy and happened so fast
But the harder they come, they fall

You have many people fooled about your motivation
But I don't believe your lies
You blow so much smoke it's bound to make you choke
I see the snakes in both of your eyes
But you wouldn't know class if it bit you in the ass
And you're standing much too tall
You may have come so easy and happened so fast
But the harder they come, they fall

Tell me what does your pride taste like honey
Or haven't you tried it out?
It's better than the taste of a boot in your face
Without any shadow of a doubt
You better learn where the line is
You missed a lot you've gotta learn about
How's it gonna feel to be put in your place
Well I guess you're about to find out
Some folks today have got nothing to say
Except to talk about their wealth
But the poor's still poor and the war's still war
And everybody wants more for themselves
Like a rich man's child you never walked a mile
One day you won't have nothing to sell
You may have come so easy and happened so fast
But the way I see it you fell

Tell me what does your pride taste like honey
Or haven't you tried it out?
It's better than the taste of a boot in your face
Without any shadow of a doubt
You better learn where the line is
You missed a lot you've gotta learn about
How's it gonna feel to be put in your place
Well I guess you're about to find out
I said how's it gonna feel to be put in your place
Well I guess you're about to find out1Embed
