Weekender LyricsI went down to the county jail and turned myself in
Spending all my weekends here far from my good-timin' friends
Things just went from bad to worse, but I don't know when
The only thing I know for sure is I ain't going back again
They took me down to cellblock B after stripping off my clothes
Put me in a monkey suit and threw me in the throes
Like a rat in a maze, a cow in the herd, or a sparrow with a broken wing
Now I know the reason why the caged bird has to sing
'Cause I'm just a weekender in the Davidson County Jail
And my old man, he ain't got the cash to even go my bail
Should have listened to my mama and quit my life of sin
Before I went backsliding again
This bed is hard and the room is cold, my cellmate's got a cough
She takes her meds and sleeps all day, got six more weeks till she's off
She said she beat her boyfriend up while high on crack cocaine
Now she sits and watches her life go down the drain
'Cause she's just a weekender in the Davidson County Jail
Her old man ain't got the cash to even go her bail
She should have listened to her mama and quit her life of sin
Before she went backsliding again
Walk into some other room, they tried to make me eat
Red-dyed gravy, cardboard bread, and something that looked like meat
One tough girl from cellblock C picked a fight with the man at the desk
Mighty Sue was sent back to her room and I bet you know the rest
'Cause we're all just weekenders in the Davidson County Jail
My old man ain't got the cash to even call my bail
Should have listened to the good Lord, maybe quit my life of sin
Before I went backsliding again
Before I went backsliding againEmbed
