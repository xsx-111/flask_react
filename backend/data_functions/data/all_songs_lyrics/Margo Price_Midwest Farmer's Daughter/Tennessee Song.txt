Tennessee Song Lyrics
Let's go back to Tennessee
You and me
Let's go back to Tennessee
Let's go back

Get off your chest what's on your mind
Pull the cork and pour the wine
Spill the beans, break the bread
The way you sing could wake the dead
I've been thinking about the road
Saddle up and let it roll
I don't know what suits you best
Sixty-five or Forty West

Without a doubt I may be wrong
But I've got a feeling going strong
In this world we won't be long

The future ain't what it used to be
Let's go back to Tennessee
Mountain high and valley low
Let's build down where the waters flow
Dig a well, pump the crank
Catch our dinner from the river bank
City life's a poison pill
Take me down where the wind is still

Take your time, baby, don't take long
Play another southern song
In this world we won't be long

Let's go back to Tennessee
You and me
Let's go back to Tennessee
Let's go back

Way back when the land was free
By nature and sovereignity
Lakota lived here long ago
Living off the buffalo
Seasons go, seasons come
Who we are and where we're from
The truth is clear to those who know
As above, so below
Take your time but don't take long
Play another southern song
In this world we won't be long

Let's go back to Tennessee
You and me
Let's go back to Tennessee
Let's go back
Let's go back to Tennessee
You and me
Let's go back to Tennessee
Let's go back
Let's go back
Woo-ooh-oohEmbed
