How the Mighty Have Fallen Lyrics
You thought you'd see how green the grass it grew
On the other side that divides me from you
You said I held you back from bigger things
Now that you're running wild, you're running back to me

How the mighty have fallen like they do every time
And to me you come crawling with your crown at your side
You were high on your mountain, now it's back to the farm
How the mighty have fallen right back into my arms

I never meant to keep you from being you
But I know that's an easier thing to say than do
You brushed me off and said I'd never grow
Now that you're on your knees, you're smaller than before

How the mighty have fallen like they do every time
And to me you come crawling with your crown at your side
You were high on your mountain, now it's back to the farm
How the mighty have fallen right back into my arms
How the mighty have fallen right back into my armsEmbed
