Hands of Time Lyrics
When I rolled out of town on the unpaved road
I was fifty-seven dollars from being broke
Kissed my mama and my sisters and I said goodbye
And with my suitcase packed, I wiped the tears from my eyes
Times, they were tough growing up at home
My daddy lost the farm when I was two years old
Took a job at the prison working second shift
And thatâ€™s the last time I let them take what should be his

'Cause all I want to do is make a little cash
'Cause I've worked all the bad jobs busting my ass
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine
And turn back the clock on the cruel hands of time

When I hit the city, I joined the band
Started singing in the bars and running with the men
But the men, they brought me problems
And the drinking caused me grief
I thought I'd found a friend, but I only found a thief
Soon I settled down with a married man
We had a couple babies, started living off the land
But my firstborn died and I cried out to God
Is there anybody out there looking down on me at all?
'Cause all I want to do is make something last
But I can't see the future, I can't change the past
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine
Turn back the clock on the cruel hands of time

Still I keep a-running fast as I can
Trying to make something honest with my own two hands
And I ain't got the breath to say another bad word
So if I ever said it wrong, won't you forget what you heard?

'Cause all I want to do is make my own path
'Cause I know what I am, I know what I have
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine
Turn back the clock on the cruel hands of time

Cruel hands of time
Cruel hands of time
Cruel hands of timeEmbed
