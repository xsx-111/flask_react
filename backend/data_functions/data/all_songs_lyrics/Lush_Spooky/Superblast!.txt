Superblast! LyricsMe in the world losing tears, shedding fears
Strain for the sun, make you run, make you come
You don't know, you don't know
I'm in my home all the time, on my own
Low finger fine, take what's mine, from behind
You don't know, you don't know, it's not there, you don't care
You're still inside of me beneath the cotton core
My pictures smile at me and soon they'll rise and soar
Fill up my space, turn around, fade and trace
Be absolute, blue and white, fatal fruit
She nylon smile full of lies, shining eyes
Cover my grin, take a chance, maybe win
It's not there, it's not fair, you don't know, you don't careEmbed
