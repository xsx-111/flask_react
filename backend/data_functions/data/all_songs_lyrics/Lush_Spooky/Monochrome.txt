Monochrome LyricsWake with the sun
What's going on, when you're gone
Fall asleep when you're near
What's going on, when you're here
And sometimes I think if I stand by the phone it may ring
And sometimes I worry and fear what tomorrow may bring
And you sing
And you sing
Breathe with your sigh
Makes me high, don't know why
Touching your skin
Wishing you were within
Your eyes are like saucers but mine are just clouded in gray
I've so much to tell but I can't and you just go away
Anyway
Won't you stay
Wake with the sun
What's going on, when you're gone
And when I lost control
I was cold, and I felt old
The ground is beneath me but slowly it's falling away
You say we're like children so why won't you come out and play?
And sometimes I think if I look at the phone it may ring
And sometimes I worry and fear what tomorrow may bring
When you sing
When you singEmbed
