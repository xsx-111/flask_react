Tiny Smiles LyricsI'd like to do
Something for you
You want me to
She's just the same
She likes to play
I'll hide kisses in your hair
Don't feel ashamed
You're not to blame
It's just a game
But just the same
What would they say

Baby angel on my knee
Our lips are sealed
Come sit with me
Slide on my knee
Sing just for me
And for a while
I'll make you smile

Baby angel on my knee
I know what you want from me
I'll make you smile
Outside she's listening
To laughter and whispering
But she won't say nothing to him, see
She's just the same
She's just the sameEmbed
