Ocean LyricsCome with me
Into a cool blue stream
Bleed into oceans green
Lips open wide
Drinking the tide
Reach for me
Here where the ocean sea
Melts and you sink with me
Deeper inside
I'll make you mine
Take me down
Down where their voices drown
Down where the only sound
Echoes for me
Floating away
Under the waves
Kiss me again
You'll tell me when
Salt on my lips
Cool fingertips
Under the sea
Stay here with meEmbed
