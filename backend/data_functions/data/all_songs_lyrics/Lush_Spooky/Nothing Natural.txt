Nothing Natural LyricsBefore I met you I was blind
Pills and liquid filled my mind
Beneath your outline I was new
Overflowing with your tune
And don't you know you're beautiful
Next month I missed you like a child
Couldn't see past you though I tried
And don't you know you're beautiful
And don't you know you're beautiful
Now I think of every hour
When you still retained your power
And the precious nights we'd share
When we'd breathe in common air
The feeling now you've gone
This wretched life goes on
The knife inside of me
It turns just like a key
The sunlight always comes too soon
My body asks me what to do
I was so small and vulnerable
And you were only beautiful
The seasons shining in your hair
And it was more than I could bear
But I can see you in my smile
And you are only beautiful1Embed
