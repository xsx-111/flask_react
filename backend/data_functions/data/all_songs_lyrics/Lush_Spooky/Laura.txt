Laura LyricsMirror maid, tummy ache
Make-up run
Lipstick girl, black stick curl
In the new york sun
Inside out, you know about my
Silly game
Even though, you don't know
About my name
Where I've been
What I dream
What I've seen
Clumsy eyes realise how to
Write the word
Basically, you sing for me
When I am hurt
Stoned and blind, never mind
Luckie's song
Press the keys, I can be
Where you belong
I'm a fan
Of your hand
Ooh
And
I'm in love
Cry above
Ooh
And
I'm a fan
Of your hand
Every man
