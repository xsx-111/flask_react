Untogether Lyrics
It's not easy but try to picture this, do
You remember that we were once together
Isn't it strange, isn't it? I'm sorry it's come to this but
Why are we here, bothering? What was it we talked about? So...

Just remind me of why I'm wasting so much
Time pretending that there is something more than
Only this, only this pointless accusation
Tell me again, why are we here?

I'm not offended by the things that you say
'Cause it's such a predictable way to behave
Talk and insult me 'til you're blue in the face
You were right, I was wrong, now does that make you happy?
I'm quite aware of all the bad things I did
You don't have to remind me of why you dislike me
There's no solution to the mess that we're in
It's so sad and so boring, I wish you'd just leave me alone

But I understand the games you play
I'm ashamed of all the things I did to you
I'm not offended by the things that you say
'Cause it's such a predictable way to behave
Talk and insult me 'til you're blue in the face
You were right, I was wrong, now does that make you happy?
I'm not offended by the things that you say
'Cause it's such a predictable way to behave
Talk and insult me 'til you're blue in the face
You were right, I was wrong, now does that make you happy?
I'm not offended by the things that you say...Embed
