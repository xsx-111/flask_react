Take LyricsHe's perfect
At least within his dreams
He's perfect
To satisfy my scheme
He doesn't know my game
I don't recall his name
And though it's true
My flesh is new
Believe me dear
My mind is clear
He's smiling
(smiling at me)
He thinks he's won the night
I'm laughing
(laughing at him)
Imagine what you like
I know he's seen
Inside I'm green
But still he's blind
To what goes on inside my mind
He's smiling
(smiling at me)
He thinks he's won the night
I'm thinking
(thinking of me)
Imagine what you like
He claimed his prize
I had my price
I know it's cruel
But I refuse
To be the only one to loseEmbed
