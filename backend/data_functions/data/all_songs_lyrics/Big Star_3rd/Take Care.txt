Take Care Lyrics
Take care not to hurt yourself
Beware of the need for help
You might need too much
And people are such

Take care, please, take care

Some people read idea books
And some people have pretty looks
But if your eyes are wide
And all words aside

Take care, please, take care

This sounds a bit like goodbye
In a way it is I guess
As I leave your side
I've taken the air

Take care, please, take care
Take care, please, take care1Embed
