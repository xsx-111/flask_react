Thank You Friends Lyrics
Thank you, friends
Wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you
I'm so grateful
For all the things you helped me do

All the ladies and gentlemen
Who made this all so probable
Thank you, friends
I rejoice to the skies
Dear ones like you do the best I do
As far as can see my eyes

Without my friends I got chaos
I'm often a bead of light
Without my friends
I'd be swept up high by the wind
All the ladies and gentlemen
I said all the ladies and gentlemen
I said all the ladies and gentlemen
I said all the ladies and gentlemen
Who made this all so probable
Thank you friends
(Thank you again)
Thank you friends
(Thank you again)
Dear, dear, friends
(I wanna thank you again)
Thank you friends
(I said, thank you again)
I said, thank you again
I wanna thank you again
Never too late to start1Embed
