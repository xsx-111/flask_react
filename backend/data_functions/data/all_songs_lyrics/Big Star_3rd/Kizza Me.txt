Kizza Me Lyrics
Dreams and wishes, like shooting stars
Coming up rushes
I want to white out
I want to white out

I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you, yeah
Kizza me
Lesa, why not

Curse wild, windy linen
Warm life, so-and-so
I want to white out
I want to come on out

I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you, yeah
Kizza me
Lesa, why not
Dreams and wishes, like shooting stars
Coming up rushes
I want to white out
I want to white out

I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you, yeah
Kizza me
Lesa, why not
That's enough, baby1Embed
