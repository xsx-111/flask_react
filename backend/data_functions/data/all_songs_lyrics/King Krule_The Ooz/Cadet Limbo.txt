Cadet Limbo Lyrics
Has it been this long?
Has it been this long since I saw you there?
Well, has it been this long?

Has it been this long since I’ve had this bond?
Lost to where I belong
I don’t ever wanna leave this night
And has it been this long?
Waltzing deep space lullaby
Well, has it been this long?
Lost paradise for one
I can see your face
Lost to where I belong
I walked across you everyday
As I floated along
Spent most of my time orbiting your waist
And had it really been this long?
Since I got lost in space?


Has it been this long since I’ve had this bond?
Has it been this long since I’ve had this bond?5Embed
