Czech One Lyrics
The train’s motion
Untidy echo
And she pants

She asked me why I’m here
But I come here every night
Do you need to tell her something?
No, I need a place to write
And as the sea of darkness forms
And casts us into night
You ask me what her name was called
But I found it hard to write
One time I was impaled forlorn
And thrown into a pile
I said you know where I’m coming from
And she looked me in the eye
Loverboy, you drown too quick
You're fading out of sight
Is it the numb density?
Can’t even look her in the eye
Where tiny men have been absorbed
For questioning the sky
To when and where the stars were formed
That glance upon this night
Light-years to sit upon
And paint us as we lie
And to think it's us she's wasted on,
Can't even look her in the eye
See I’ve found a new place to mourn
She asked me who died
Well if there’s a dark uniform
I need a place to hide
As simple as his faith had gone
The burning of the spire
And yet he still searched for warmth
But it was cold by the fire

She grips me tight, she grips me tight
But I still rip at the seams
I can’t sleep at night, never slept at night
But she still sits in my dreams
I’m out of sight, so out of sight
But she sees what I see
She's watching me
She's still watching me
She still sees what I see
The train’s motion
