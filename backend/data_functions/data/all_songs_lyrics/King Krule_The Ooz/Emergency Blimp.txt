Emergency Blimp Lyrics
No help still
No help still

He said it hurts when he stares at lights
I guess my brain was full, indecision's on the lefthand side
But the doctor said it's cool, just take these in the dead of night
Within the deepest sleep, you'll fall, my head hit bed, but my mind's still alive

These pills just make me, these pills just make me drool
I say these pills just make me, these pills just make me, these pills just make me, these pills just make me drool

I told him he weren't doing things right
So he put me on some more, no change as a year flew by
I gave that fraud a call, he sniggered when I told my plight

He told me I was, he told me I was wrong
He told me I was, he told me I was
He told me I was, he told me I was

And now she's sat alone, the deep of night
She's sitting in a pool, makes incisions on the righthand side
Her blood is in me, her blood is in the song
Yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in the song
Yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in the walls

Yeah, no help still
Yeah, no help still
No help still
No help still2Embed
