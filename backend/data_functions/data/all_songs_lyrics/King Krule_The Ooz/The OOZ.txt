The OOZ Lyrics
Hello?
Through moans of the dead
The universe in skulls
Hello?
As oceans stand still
Steel structures dissolves
Of dust soft fuzz
Is anybody out there? Hello?
She pants, she pants
All I can see is her mouth
Is anybody out there? Hello?
Its motion, it's urgent, its trigger
Is there anybody out there?
Pulling us in, she pants
Is there anybody out there?
Distortion trails up spines
The locomotive has arrived
Is there anybody out there?
The locomotive has arrived

I don’t know why
I search for you
Could we align?
Can we meet here?
Until the end of time
Is there anybody out there?
'Cause I'm all alone
In soft bleeding, we will unite
We OOZ two souls, pastel blues
Heightened touch from losing sight
Swimming through the blue lagoon
Basking in the dark of night
Of depths unknown to be explored
We sink together through the sky (the sky)

I don’t know why
I search for you
Could we align?
Could we meet here?
Until the end of time

Is anybody out there?
A lover's sigh
To be absorbed
But I let go, I slip alone
Sorrow weeps my lucid eye (lucid eye)
Abandoned bodies by numb minds
The universe salutes, Lucifer cries
Within heartbeats, you strum goodbye
Within your heartbeats, you say goodbye
I don’t know why
Is anybody out there?
Could we align?
She pants she steals
Can’t you breathe
Through moans of the dead
The universe in skulls
As oceans stand still
Steel structures dissolve
She weeps
Her sweet sting
Bleeding perfume perpetually
It overflows, it sinks
It drips in obnoxious ink
On streets, in clothes
She leaps, she limps
Tense liquid herbivore
Cannibal pacifier
She pushes me off
It’s cold by the fire6Embed
