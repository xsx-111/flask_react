A Slide In (New Drugs) Lyrics
Won’t be wasting my time
Won't be wasting my time

I'm used to saying, “I don’t belong”
A burdened youth outcast from young
But how are you? I'm wasting your own time
And once consumed, spit gunk from lungs
To tell the truth, I haven't done
But how are you? I'm wasting your own time
My skin is bleach, my hair is long
I have no teeth, I've never done
My gums are raw and bleeding all the time
The shapes are grey, the cityscape
Bourgeoisie change to replicate
How can I be feeling the same as you?

'Cause they
Girl, they
Won’t be wasting my time
They, the suns will sinks
Won't be wasting my time7Embed
