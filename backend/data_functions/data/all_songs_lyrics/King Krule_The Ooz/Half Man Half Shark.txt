Half Man Half Shark Lyrics
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark

Half man with the body of a shark
Man, you know they left me in the dark for days
Ah man, if you try and it works, well maybe it can stay
It was a corrosive touch, I just lost too much in my soul
Perhaps the emotive rush turned my brain to mush
I’ll never know
You were so fine the moonlight
Head aligned with your eyes in my sight
Caught everything
Simple soft thoughts, simples soft thoughts become menacing
Twisted raw adrenaline
Racing through my bones, racing through my body

I’ll never know
Ah man, if you try and it works, well maybe it could stay
It’s the evoking trust holding this frame of rust, I had to let go
To let this place combust you must refrain from lust
Dismantle the throne

You were so fine the moonlight
Head aligned with your eyes in my sight
Caught everything
Simple soft thoughts, simples soft thoughts become menacing
Twisted raw adrenaline
Racing through my bones, racing through my body

And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to hide it
You’re not even there
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to fight it
You’re not even aware
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to fight it
You’re not even there
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to fight it
You’re not even there
Brother, brother
I’ve only got two fighting hands
Brother, brother
Make it hard for us to understand
Brother, brother
I’ve only got two fighting hands
Brother, brother
They make it hard for us to get together in this land
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with the body of a shark
Don’t try to hide it
Half man with the body of a shark
See world, you’ll never know
At least when you look to the stars they still glow
Well, not for me though
Body and head are empty, even when we're toe to toe
Well, I suppose I’ll forever be the only one who knows
Aspirations ingrown, I’ll forever be alone
See world, you’ll never know
At least when you look to the stars they still glow
Well, not for me though
Body and head are empty, even when we're toe to toe
Well, I suppose I’ll forever be the only one who knows
Aspirations ingrown, girl, I’ll forever be alone
They just don’t care2Embed
