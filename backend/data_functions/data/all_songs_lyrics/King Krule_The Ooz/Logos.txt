Logos Lyrics
She smoked me whole and blows out Os
The sink had sunk, it overflows
The door is shut, my eyes are closed
I hear her moan or what I suppose
The thing about her, I must let go
Why I sing about her, she’ll never know
The bookie's shut, all bets are blown
The license bust, the shops are closed
I caught my mum, she stumbles home
Through open ground, back to broken homes
I thought about her, her smell through clothes
Her spoken smoke, mixed with my cologne
We were soup together, but now it’s cold
We were glue together, but it weren’t to hold
Her solvents dissolved
Her solvents dissolved
Her solvents dissolved

The ups and downs, deep velvet folds
The landslides in, depression poles
Once thought was shed, but always holds
Reflection taunts my empty soul
The sky will weep on my way home
The bus won’t let me on, I’ll have to stroll
And in my head, tormented prole
As lies were fed, he swallowed whole
The soup was grey, intense charcoal
He molded clay at intervals
The lights would change, the same logo
I passed your house, it looked so cold
In dreams together, white noise arose
She draws me in and swallows whole6Embed
