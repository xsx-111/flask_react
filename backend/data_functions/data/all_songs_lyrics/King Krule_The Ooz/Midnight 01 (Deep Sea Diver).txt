Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver) LyricsBathed city
Bathed city
The liquid scenery
Cast an indigo complexation
To drift so carefree, moonlight reflects in the pool of darker times
And to sink to darker measures
Submariner seeks pride from depths hard to find, forever wading
A pool of strange things
Its guilt, is craving, this comfort, it’s quilt
And outside I think it’s raining
Why’d you leave me? Because of my depression?
You used to complete me but I guess I learnt a lesson
Things are even
But don’t even out
The deep sea diver’s in doubt
*murmurs*
*murmurs*
*murmurs*
And if we swim down low
This pressure might go beneath the covers the cotton ceiling
And if we swim down low
This pressure might grow beneath city lights I’m wandering home
And if we swim down low
The pressure might go beneath the sheets I’m covered in
And if we swim down low
The pressure might grow those woes were still hovering
This day’s slipping
I feel my feet drift
Tarmac city skin
I walk the beat swift
The sunsets, the moon lifts
Those blue hours, those blue hours
Those blue hours, that blue shift3Embed
