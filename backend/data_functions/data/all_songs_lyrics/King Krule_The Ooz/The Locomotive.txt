The Locomotive Lyrics
I’m not in the mood, but I gotta move
At least what I was hoping
The barriers stayed open
Now it’s just for the wait
And how unjust is this weight
My back was so broken
Tear me apart, pull me open
(Look inside) See the corrosion
The Tannoy spoke my name
This vessel was delayed
No objects in motion
A subject to smoking
The platform sighs, “My empty emotion”
As trackies walk on by
I’m alone, I’m alone
In deep isolation
In the dead of night, in the dead of night
Waiting for the train
In the dead of night I howl
We all have our evils
We’re told just to keep calm
Curled up and feeble
Plagued by our brains, the internal sinking pain
I wish I was equal, if only that simple
I wish I was people (I wish)
The train it now arrives, I plead just take me home
Step the gap of minds, he steps the gap of minds
We all have our evils
We’re told just to keep cool
The soul of the people
I wish I was equal, I wish I was equal, I wish I was equal
Twist the soul of the people2Embed
