La Lune LyricsSins will swallow explicit
Kinks of hollow mystic
That sit deep in a limp twitch
Turns a pale tanner
Handspan a hammer
Consults a cold manner
That lies deep in the grammar
Mono inner collision
Born to mid decision
Born bare invision
Just to master a sigh
They found reasons to try
Clone the sea at night
Brave waves bathe the eye
Well I crave ways to dry
Well I was raised to the moon
Just to hold a gaze with you
Cross the other side
It won’t be long till you’re inside
Till you’re inside my heart
*murmurs*
Used heat cooling
Steady steeps falling
Brain keeps stooping to avoid
Thoughts of matter
Pristine platter replicates the flatter of a nervous crane
Some won’t understand and it my deplete a man
By seeping through the cracks of bland
They found reasons to try
Clone the sea at night
Brave waves bathe the eye
Well I crave ways to dry
See I was raised to the moon
Just to hold a gaze with a view
Across the other side
It won’t be long till you’re inside
Till you’re inside my heart
Till you’re inside
Till you’re inside my heart
To be with you, such a view
To be elevated to you
To be elevated to you6Embed
