Slush Puppy Lyrics
Don't you dare baby, dare baby, dare
Face me already, replace me already
Nothing's working with me
Nothing's working with me
Don’t you dare baby, dare baby, dare
Face me already, replace me already
Don’t be scared, don’t be scared, don’t be scared
Deface me already
I’m a waste, baby
And I’m alone
So you come over
I’m down under sea
I’m down under
Nothing's working with
Me, nothing’s working
With me
I’m this worthless you see
Nothings working with me
Nothings working with me
Nothings working with me8Embed
