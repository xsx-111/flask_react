The Safest Place Lyrics
In my heart your love has found
The safest hiding place
Inside is a field and trees and a lake
Around is a wall, no one from hell could break

In there you'll shine
In there you will cry

My heart has been a lonely warrior
Who's been to war, so you can be sure
In my heart your love has found
The safest hiding place

Inside is a stream
Around is a wall no one from hell could break

In there will shine the light of heaven's eye
In there you will cry

My heart's been a lonely warrior
Who's been to war so you can be sure
Your love's in a sacred place
The safest hiding place
My heart has been a lonely warrior before
Who's been to war, so you can be sureEmbed
