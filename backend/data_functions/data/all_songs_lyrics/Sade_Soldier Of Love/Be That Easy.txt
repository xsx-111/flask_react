Be That Easy Lyrics
You, baby, were like the sky
You held me up to let me fly
That's just like you to tell me I've nothing to fear

But I am a broken house
I'm holding on a broken bough
Now it's easy for me to see

It couldn't be that easy
It had to be much harder
That's just like you to tell me I've nothing to fear

But I could have been falling free
Falling all these years
Now it's easy for me to see

Full of air
Sun on my face, wind in my hair
Falling down
Flying as slow as I can
I'm not trying to reach the land
Just falling somewhere
It couldn't be that easy
It had to be much harder
Meanwhile, boy, I love youEmbed
