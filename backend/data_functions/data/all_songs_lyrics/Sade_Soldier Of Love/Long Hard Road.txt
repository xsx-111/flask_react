Long Hard Road Lyrics
There's a long hard road ahead
But a voice inside me said
"You know there's something that you need to know
It's gonna be alright"
Said "there's something that you need to know
It's gonna be alright"

When in this life, in this life when I can only turn my chin
I know it's gonna be alright
When this big old town is closing in and I've lost again
Here I could stay but I'll keep moving on
Here I could stay but I'll keep moving on
Could be I won't be wrong

There's a long hard road ahead
But a voice inside me said
"Said there's something that you need to know
It's gonna be alright
Said there's something that you need to know
It's gonna be alrightEmbed
