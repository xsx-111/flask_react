Skin Lyrics
When I found out this love's undone
I was like a gun
Sure as it was over
Felt like nothing good could come

Sure as it's gonna play and play
Like Michael back in the day
I'm gonna peel you away

Now as I begin
To wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
'Cause you're not right within

I love you so
Sometimes love has to let go
So this time don't think it's a lie
I say goodbye

Now as I begin
To wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
'Cause you're not right within
Now it's time
To wash you off my skin
Now as I begin
It couldn't be right 'cause you're not right within
I say goodbyeEmbed
