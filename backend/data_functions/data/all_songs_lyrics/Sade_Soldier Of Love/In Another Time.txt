In Another Time Lyrics
You'd be surprised, girl
Soon they'll mean nothing to you
They'll fall into their brew
And take down some of the boys with them, too
There's nothing
Nothing that you have to do

In another time, girl
Your tears won't leave a trace
In another time, girl
In another place

You've been down, girl
Their whispers are hailstones in your face
You're so tired of waiting
For something to change
They don't know what to do with
Something so good
That you wouldn't hurt them
You wouldn't hurt them if you could

One of these days
They're gonna fall into their brew
And they'll know exactly what they did to you
Darling, I just want you to know
Your tears won't leave a trace
In another time, girl
In another time, girl
In another place

Darling, I just want you to know
Your tears won't leave a trace
In another time, girl
In another time, girl1Embed
