Poor Heart Lyrics
1,2,3,4

You won't steal my poor heart again
(No not my poor!)
You won't steal my poor heart again
(No never again!)
You won't steal my tape recorder
I'll call the law'r
And put you in the pen
You won't steal that thing again

(You're going to jail!)

I didn't even know your name or what was your game
But stealin' things has sure brought you to fame
I'll hound you so much, it's one of a kind
Not sayin' if you're to blame
Life will never be the same

You won't steal my poor heart again
You won't steal my poor heart again
You won't steal my tape recorder
I'll call the law'r
And put you in the pen
You won't steal that thing again
I can't track you anymore
Detective work has sure become a bore
So tell me what you did with it
And stop this shit, give up yourself
Before they come knockin' at your door

You won't steal my poor heart again
You won't steal my poor heart again
When I feel the blade of that Cupid sword
I'll call the Law'r and he'll put you in the pen
You won't steal that thing again
You won't steal my poor heart againEmbed
