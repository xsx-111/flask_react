Borderline LyricsTake me to the heart of you
Take me to the heart of you
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Take me to the heart of you
Take me to your heart and then
Take me to your heart and then
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Take me to your heart again
Take me where the fields are green
Take me where the fields are green
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Take me where the fields are green
Take me to your heart somehow
Take me to your heart somehow
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Take me cause I need you now
Take me to cross your borderline
Take me to cross your borderline
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Take me to cross your borderline
Take me where I wanna be
Take me from this misery
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Take me where I wanna be
Take me to the heart of you
Take me to the heart of you
Take me to the heart of you
The heart of you...
The heart of you...Embed
