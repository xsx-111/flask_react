Every Little Thing Lyrics
If your heart could talk
I wonder what it would tell me?
If your mind could walk
Would it bring me a love never ending?
Yes, I've got to know
I've got to know

No secrets anymore
You've got to tell me

All your days have gone
A-goin' to a go-go
Now the time has come
Is it gonna be a no no, no no no?
I've got to know
I've got to know

No secrets anymore
You've got to tell me

Tell me every little thing
That makes you happy
Oh oh oh, every little thing
That makes you glad
All the secrets that you hide
I've got to know
Whoa, every little thing
You gotta stop
All your reservations
Am I for the chop
Or is it celebrations?
Yes, I've got to know
I've got to know

No secrets anymore
You've got to tell me

Tell me every little thing
That makes you happy
Oh oh oh, every little thing
That makes you glad
All the secrets that you hide
I've got to know
Whoa, every little thing

Tell me every little thing (Tell me)
Every little thing (Tell me)

Tell me every little thing
That makes you happy
Oh oh oh, every little thing
That makes you glad
The secrets that you hide
I've got to know
Whoa, every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thingEmbed
