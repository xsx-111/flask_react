Forecast LyricsThe forecast miserable to gloomy, overcast to grim
The outlook sadly bleak to gale force, cold hard rain or wind
If you could get a ticket to the place you wanna be
Where would you be now, girl?
Where would you be?
Deep depression looming over, pushing to the shore
Raining on the wodden faces, raining on the wooden floor
Sail out into nothing, way beyond the shining sea
Where would you be now, girl?
Where would you be... girl?
Be... girl?
Where would you be?
The rain is gonna fall down on Desperation Alley
The clouds will shed their tears, upon the high and mighty
Fly a new horizon, to a dream you'll never be
Where would you be now, girl?
Where would you be... girl?
Where would you be... girl?
Where would you be... girl?
Where would you be?
(Where would you be now?)
Where would you be?
Where would you be?
Where would you be?
(Where would you be?)
Where would you be?Embed
