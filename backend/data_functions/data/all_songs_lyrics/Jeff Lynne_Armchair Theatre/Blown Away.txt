Blown Away LyricsSo let it rain
Or let the sun shine down on me
I feel no pain
Now that you're here it's all the same
You are the one
I should have known
I'm blown away
Like a boat out on the ocean
Time rages on
And all I do is watch the way
Because of you
Nothing will ever be the same
You are the one
I should have known
I'm blown away
Like a boat out on the ocean
Blown away
Like a storm in the night
(Blown away)
You are the one
I should have known
Blown away
Like a boat out on the ocean
Blown away
Like a storm in the night
I'm blown away
Blown awayEmbed
