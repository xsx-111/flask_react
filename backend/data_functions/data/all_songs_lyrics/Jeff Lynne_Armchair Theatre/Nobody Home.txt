Nobody Home LyricsI can tell by the way
There ain't no lights in the windows
And by the way your curtains hang
Yeah, I know which way the wind blows
I said no
I said no
I said no
Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)
Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)
You went away with your heavy load
Yeah, you must have took it with you
Down and out, to no thanks to boat
But no one can get ya
I said no
(Nobody)
I said no
(Nobody)
I said no, no
Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)
Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)
I said nobody
(No)
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
From the way that you act
I guess you hardly been there
By the look in your eyes
There's nobody in there
I said no
(Nobody)
I said no
(Nobody)
I said no
Ain't nobody home
Nobody home
I said nobody
(No)
Nobody
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
I said no
(Nobody)
I said no
(Nobody)
I said no, no, no
Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)
There's nobody home
(Nobody home)
I said nobody
(No)
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
Ain't nobody home
(Nobody home)
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
Ain't nobody, nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody homeEmbed
