Stormy Weather LyricsDon't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my girl and I ain't been together
Keeps raining all the time
Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't seem to get myself together
I'm weary all the time, oh yeah
Since she went away
The blues walked in and met me
If she stays away
Old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The Lord will let me
Walk in the sun once more
Since she went away
The blues walked in and met me
If she stays away
OId rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The Lord will let me
Walk in the sun once more
Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't been together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time
Stormy weather
Stormy weather
Stormy weather
Keeps raining all the timeEmbed
