What Would It Take LyricsRemember what you told me
That you would always be there
If you change your mind now
Oh, what would it take to save me?
What would it take to save me now?
Here comes another night
And all the stars are shining
Could I make it right?
Oh, what would it take to save me?
What would it take to save me now?
Woah, what would it take?
Woah, what would it take
To save me?
What would it take to save me?
What would it take to save me now?
Woah, what would it take?
(What would it take to save me now?)
Woah, what would it take
(What would it take to save me now?)
To save me?
Of all the things I do
And everywhere they take me
You know what I go through
Ooh, what would it take to save me?
What would it take to save me now?
What would it take to save me?
What would it take to save me now?Embed
