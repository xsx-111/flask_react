Save Me Now LyricsOne day the Earth woke up, said:
Boy, I feel half dead
Somebody's churning up the poison
And it's getting in my head
Sometimes I wish my guests
Would move away somewhere
'Cause I'm burning up all over
I can't even breathe the air
Save me now, save me now, save me now
Save me now, save me now
One day the Earth woke up, said:
Boy, it's getting hot
And remember all those trees I had?
But now there ain't a lot
And my ice caps slowly trickling
Down to where the party's at
And if everybody's a-going there
Well, that's the end of that
Save me now, save me now
Come on and save me now, save me now
Save me nowEmbed
