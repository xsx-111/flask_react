Lift Me Up Lyrics
Love is what I want, oh yeah
And all you gotta do is bring it to me, baby
Talk is what I want, oh yeah
(What I want, what I want)
And all you gotta do is bring it to me, baby

(Talk) Come on, let's talk about it
(Talk) Can't seem to do without it
(Talk) Don't want to be one of
The broken-hearted

So lift me up, finish what you started
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken-hearted
River's deep and wide

All I want is love, oh yeah
(What I want, what I want)
And all you gotta do is listen to me, baby
(What I want, what I want)

(Think) You've got to think about it
(Think) And do something about it
(Think) No use complainin'
When it's over (Over)
So lift me up, finish what you started
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken-hearted
River's deep and wide

'Cause life gets tougher every day
If you can't afford to pay
Even so, you've got to carry on (Carry on)

So lift me up, finish what you started
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken-hearted
River's deep and wide

Lift me up
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken-hearted
River's deep and wide

(Lift me up)
Oh yeah, now
Lift me up, oh
The river's deep and wideEmbed
