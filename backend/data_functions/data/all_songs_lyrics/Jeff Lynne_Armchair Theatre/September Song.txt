September Song LyricsOh, it's a long long time
From May to December
And the days grow short
When you reach September
When the autumn weather
Turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time
For the waiting game
When days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I'd share with you
When the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And all those golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I'd share with youEmbed
