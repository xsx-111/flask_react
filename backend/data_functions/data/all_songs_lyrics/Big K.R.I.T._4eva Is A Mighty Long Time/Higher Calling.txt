Higher Calling Lyrics
It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

Pick up when I call ya', I'ma be there in a second
Need directions when you get this message, somethin's goin' on
Earlier this mornin', had a feelin' that we might've hit the ceiling
And our purpose ain't fulfillin' in this home, so
Maybe we should take some time on it
Put a groove on, and bump and grind on it
And get our mind right, the stars align like our very vessels
And I know that we ain't planets but I'm knowin' somethin' special
Comes from callin' Heaven, dialin' seven's, waitin' on a pickup
Stomach bigger, skin is glowin', girl I love your figure
This is simple, this is real, somethin' to remember
Had to hit ya, so we could blend such a lovely mixture

It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'
Pick up when I call ya, I was starvin' for your garden
And I heard that you was thirsty, this is perfect, I got water
We could plant a seed and grow it, won't nobody know it
'Til' you showin', overflowin', overdoin', double soulin', hey
This ain't 'bout no bill collectors askin' you for time
Sally Mae can't get connected when you on this line
This is private, this a island, this is more than bein' worth it
This is callin' when yo' lights go out and they start back workin'
This is unexpected, such a blessing, had to tell you to express it
You wouldn't feel it if I texted no emojis were selective
Because I'm serious 'bout this here
Signal strong, I'm clear about this here

It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

Hydration
Meditation, elevation
Celebration
Levitation, this is elation
Higher callin', higher callin'
Ooh, we got a higher callin', higher callin'
Higher callin', higher
Higher callin', higher2Embed
