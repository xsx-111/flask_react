Miss Georgia Fornia Lyrics
You told 'em you was brought up
Underneath my umbrella
I was the one that taught ya
Together means we'll be forever
I see you moved to Georgia
Oh, I see you moved to Georgia
On your way to L.A

We got a love and hate relationship, I know (I know)
But I'll keep you on my mind, no matter where I go (I go)
We got a love and hate relationship, I know (I know)
But I'll keep you on my mind, no matter where I go (I go)

I had to be out
'Cause we've been cool since grasshoppers and there's no doubt
Can't chill out on the post, so please don't say that we not
The type that have to move on
Since the King up and died, and the Blues gone
So, I'mma skip my feet and up my fee and make some moves
Long as I hit the road, and break the mold, I never lose
I don't do this just for self, I do this all for you
Yo mama', daddy, sister, brother and ya' cousin too
And all them country folks who never settled fo'
That average shit they throw us out on the daily
I know we better though, I watched award shows
I swear they haven't talked about us outchea' lately
Unless it's negative or irrelevant
But I never ever ever let it phase me
I keep you on my mind and you in my heart
You know that everything you are made me
Darling
You told 'em you was brought up
Underneath my umbrella
I was the one that taught ya
Together means we'll be forever
I see you moved to Georgia
Oh, I see you moved to Georgia
On your way to L.A

We got a love and hate relationship, I know (I know)
But I'll keep you on my mind, no matter where I go (I go)
We got a love and hate relationship, I know (I know)
But I'll keep you on my mind, no matter where I go (I go)

I'm sorry that I left you but I had to
You can be sour all you want but we'll have you
Sweetened on the low, we've been bitter and it shows
Perhaps if the willow stop weepin', it'll grow
But I guess we'll never know
I just keep puttin' on it, Southern tonin'
Heard through the grapevine and a couple songs
Some of yo' fam hatin' on me, I'm never home, I know you lonely
Even if the sun shinin', it's still stormin'
I know they left us on the dock and kept goin'
I'm knowin' when you think I might go and do the same
I can promise I do the job and come back again
When my casket drops
I love you for your cool off and the cast is not
Why wouldn't you cheer me on if I had the shot?
I thought you wanted what's best for me so how could you ask me to stop?
Darling
You told 'em you was brought up
Underneath my umbrella
I was the one that taught ya
Together means we'll be forever
I see you moved to Georgia
Oh, I see you moved to Georgia
On your way to L.A

We got a love and hate relationship, I know (I know)
But I'll keep you on my mind, no matter where I go (I go)
We got a love and hate relationship, I know (I know)
But I'll keep you on my mind, no matter where I go (I go)
 + (Joi)
We got history (history)
And I know that means a lot (and I know that means a lot)
But, you got skeletons in your closet (skeletons in your closet)
And they're piled up to the top (piled up to the top)
We got jealous love (jealous love)
And I know that causes pain (I know that causes pain)
But the sun don't shine the same (sun don't shine the same)
And those teardrops fall like rain (teardrops fall like rain)
On my country head (on my country head)
When I'm tryna be on my own (trying to be on my own)
You might think I fled
But right now I can't come back home (I can't come back home)
I know what I said
That I'll never ever leave you alone (I'll never ever leave you alone)
But I need you to give me time
To bring back all this shine (all this shine)
Hold on
You told 'em you was brought up
Underneath my umbrella
I was the one that taught ya
Together means we'll be forever
I see you moved to Georgia
Oh, I see you moved to Georgia
On your way to L.A

We got a love and hate relationship, I know (I know)
But I'll keep you on my mind, no matter where I go (I go)
We got a love and hate relationship, I know (I know)
But I'll keep you on my mind, no matter where I go (I go)

(Never ever leave you)
I see ya' moved to Georgia (Never ever leave you)
I see ya' moved to Georgia (Never ever leave you)
I see ya' moved to Georgia on your way to L.A
I see ya' moved to Georgia
I see ya' moved to Georgia
I see ya' moved to Georgia
I see ya' moved to Georgia on your way to L.A
I see ya' moved to Georgia
I see ya' moved to Georgia on your way to L.A
On your way to L.A (On your way to L.A)
On your way to L.A (On your way to L.A)
On your way to L.AEmbed
