Mixed Messages Lyrics
Yeah, I'm sorry

Uhh, I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way?
I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way?
Revolutionary, although I'm free
I got me a lover, but I still wanna cheat
I wanna be safe, but it's fuck the police
Don't wanna be here, but I'm too scared to leave
I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way?
I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way?
Revolutionary, although I'm free
I got me a lover, but I still wanna cheat
I wanna be safe, but it's fuck the police
Don't wanna be here, but I'm too scared to leave

Said I'm too scared to leave, I got a whole lotta—
I'm too scared to leave, I got a whole lotta mixed messages
I'm too scared to leave
Yeah, yeah (I got a whole lotta—)
Yeah (I got a whole lotta—)
Uhh, I love her and I hate her at the same time
I'm wack and I'm dope in the same rhyme
I'm dull but I'm gloss in the same shine
It's confusing on a sunny day
I never really liked all the fake shit
But I'm attracted to the fake ass and fake tits
That's why I made a song like original
To remind me of what fake is
I wanna be rich, but I'm givin' back
I love her like none other but don't get attached
Screamin' "peace" over beats, but I grab a strap
I help you make a meal but I got a cap
It's still fuck you, but I'll give you dap
I really wanna sing but I better rap
God on my line after all, but I ain't pick up when he called
Matter of fact, I ain't pick up at all, cause my bills paid now
Said my grace now, my lights is still on, so why would I pray now?
Home is the best place for me, so why would I stay now?
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, but I never could (lay down!)
I only got a gun to protect myself
The AK make a nigga shake down
I love social network for music
But the negativity'll make you break down, like damn

(I got a whole lotta, I got a whole lotta)
(I got a whole lotta, I got a whole lotta)
Uhh (I got a whole lotta—)
