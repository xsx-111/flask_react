Drinking Sessions Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
I got these ideas, I got a lot on my mind
And it's so hard to put 'em in a lot of songs
I try to put 'em all in one, you know
Just what I'm feelin', what I'm goin' through
I've been drinkin', so please bear with me

Eyes wide shut, barely eatin', tryna get my game on
Played it too cool, almost like I'm froze, had to turn my flame on
All the while, watch 'em X me out
Magazine cover, mothafucka, I ain't tripping
My flow, senior citizen shit
And maybe they'll listen to me when they sixty
Breakin' some bread down, treat it like the Last Supper
Toast to all the time we were po', but still we had one another
Hoppin' in, out of shuttles, I'ma be big, momma, I'ma get rich, momma
I'm sorry, I ain't got a wife or kids momma, but look what I did momma
Got a house that I barely can stay in, a car I barely can drive
I'd be a liar if I said gettin' money didn't make me feel alive
Hustlin', arguin' about who’s better than I in tweets
But what does it matter when a new artist come out like every week?
And the label all on they nutsack, good for them, keep suckin'
Most rappers'll bend over for you, but me? Bitch, I'm not for fuckin', over
I'd be the biggest star, they told me
Signed my name on that line and when I die, that's when it's over
Movin' on to the set, I was just a talented black kid
But to them, I looked like a check
Another five years of slavin' and then it's on to the next
I was tryna be what I envisioned as a child
A king ain't a man of God when ain't no church in the wild
Shit been fucked up 'cause they don't talk about Christ
Everybody trying to die young but who gon' talk about life?
I pull that card, good Lord, Confederate flag, shit so flawed
They used to fly it like pilots and burn crosses in our yards
I can't get with ya if you with that whistlin' Dixie they want that old time back
But niggas got a hundred rounds and automatics so we ain't having that
I ain't promotin' no violence, it's people out here been wildin'
So much that you can get gunned down just for being happy and smilin'
Ain't no hotline worth dialin' to say the world needs help
We too busy fillin' our needs that we might kill us ourselves
I got my gumption from my granny, had a dream about her like last night
She held me tight and told me, "Little one, everything gon' be alright"
My mind playin' tricks on me, but I needed that there
In a world where I feel all alone sometimes I'm needin' her care
It's hard to share my insecurities so I medicate, I mean meditate
And pray to God for a second chance, for Heaven's sake
I'm just waitin' on a sign or two, like what I'ma do
When my heart get rusty and tired and it ain't shinin' through?
And I think about death a lot, my father scared of dyin'
I can relate, I call him before every flight, in case I ain't meant for flying
I can't hold it back, can't control these tears, I mean after all these years
I'm still the kid writin' poems, too shy to eat in the cafeteria
I'm two cups in and three shots away
From givin’ a fuck about any of the shit that I done had to say
Lord knows, it's hard to see the truth with your eyes closed
It's hard to protect your feelin's when you so exposed
Yeah, I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
I let it all slip away
And now all I can say
Is here's a toast to a better day
And the love that will come and stay
Oh God, oh God, oh God, wherever You are, yeah
I call Your name near and far
Oh God, oh God, oh God, wherever You are, yeah
I call Your name near and far
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
Oh God, oh God
Oh God, oh God
Oh yeah, uh5Embed
