Keep the devil Off Lyrics
Lord, be my witness
Gotta keep the devil off (Gotta keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Gotta keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Can't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches
If you're six feet under? Lord, be my witness
Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)

I was born on the Southside of the moon
Country boy did this big from the bottom of the map
To the top of the mountain, pimpin', I'm on the move
I'm in the groove on the late night
I make the move if the play right
You ain't seen it like I seen it
My vision nowadays 'bout as bright as the daylight
Supernova; I made a strong foundation
Outta all these boulders I carry
I ran them snakes in my yard
And you were tuckin' your tail, actin' all scary
We ain't cut from that cloth (Well)
I paid in gold what I bought (Well)
I ran circles 'round y'all
And never, ever, ever got caught (Wooh)
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Can't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches (Those riches)
If you're six feet under? (Under) Lord, be my witness
Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Can't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches (Those riches)
If you're six feet under? (Under) Lord, be my witness
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)

I was born underneath the pecan tree (Pecan tree)
With the soul of giant and the heart of a lion
But now world couldn't wait for an OG
I was creepin', crawlin', fallin' out the shack
Backwards slippin' upward through the crack
Now I creep in storage where you want to be
But barely get to see but never ever at paid for
I made more than they thought I would on my tax
I mix the candy with the grain
And the soul with the swang and the bang
And that's called bounce
We ain't cut from that cloth (Well)
I paid in gold what I bought (Well)
I ran circles 'round the non-believers
The feds, the people and never got caught (Wooh!)
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Can't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches (Those riches)
If you're six feet under? (Under) Lord, be my witness
Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Ain't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches (Those riches)
If you're six feet under? (Under) Lord, be my witness

Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off, devil off
Keep the devil off, devil off
Keep the devil off, devil off
Keep the, keep the devil off
Keep the, keep the devil off
Keep, hol' up, the—
Keep, hol' up
Keep, hol' up
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(You gotta keep the devil off you—ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Can't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches (Those riches)
If you're six feet under? (Under) Lord, be my witness
Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)

(Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off, devil off, devil off, devil off
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Keep the devil off, devil off, devil off, devil off
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (Ah, ah, ah)
(Keep the devil off)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (Ah, ah, ah)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
(Keep the devil off, keep the devil off, keep the devil off)
Lord, be my witness
Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)7Embed
