Everlasting Lyrics
Everlasting
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'

Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm askin' if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

I know this sound like one of those love songs
Perhaps it's on time since all the love's gone
And we trap it out, trap it out, but you don't like hip hop
'Cause you don't know what they rap about, nowadays I don't know either
But I ain't like most people
I'ma hit you with that "How you doin'? What you vibin' to and can I vibe with you?
And if the world was filled with flowers surrounded by waterfalls
And mountains despite the fact I just met you, can I lie with you?"
Shit, we outside the club though
And I'm knowin' what I'm sayin' make you wonder what I'm at the club for
To tell the truth I barely go out
I know your homegirl, she kick it with my partner, I tagged along with 'em
And they knew a friend that had a friend that I should meet
She don't like clubs, but she fall through sometimes just to see
So I'm guessin' that you her, it's just you and me
Let's skip out on this waterhole and find a place to be
In peace
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

Ayy, excuse me shawty, if you don't mind me
Pointing out the fact you're just my type
I mean my type like when God broke the mold and designed you
From head to toe He know I'd fall in love with ya at first sight
I know that ain't no gangsta gangsta shit but I figured you hear
"I'm a hood nigga, fuck with me, damn you bad shawty" all the time
Don't get me wrong, that was me as a teenager
But I'm grown now and I think you deserve a better line
But not "line" like spit game, more like spiritual flames
To ignite the natural high that we all got
I know your homegirl told you don't fuck with us country boys
'Cause we players, but we all not
Now I admit I ain't perfect but who is nowadays?
A man can break your heart all sorts of kinda ways
But if you take my number down and hit me when you home
I can promise you I ain't shit like Tyrone
Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty

Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm askin' if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

Excuse me shawty (ahahahah!)1Embed
