Layup Lyrics
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup
Sunshine on my window, let's go float
Pass me that pick and roll, off backboard
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup

I come from the bottom, name of the cotton
Do whatever just to profit
Who is that knockin' off in the projects
'Fridgerator, empty pockets
Just a dream of makin' dollars
Fly my mama to the tropics
When you barely used to make it by
You were do or die now we got it
Look at how we livin' now
Skyscraper tall, built from the ground
Tired of seein' my pops go to work
Can't wait 'til the day he can lounge
Promise that I do it big
For my family and my friends
Took some losses just to win
Put Multi till the end
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup (that's a layup, that's a layup)
Layup, layup (that's a layup, that's a layup)
Sunshine on my window, let's go float
Pass me that pick and roll, off backboard
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup
Lookin' like a layup, layup, ay
Lookin' like a layup, layup, ay
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup

I remember talkin' 'bout how we gon' make it out the hood, man
And no matter who blow up first, we'll rep that, understood, man
Gotta represent, I do it for my hometown
M-I-Crooked, we done took it worldwide, worldwide, we on now
(Higher, higher, higher) Cause we done seen low
(Never turn down your fire) Gotta let your light show
(Multi the empire) Put that on my life though
Nowadays we drive slow, scorin' with my eyes closed

Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup (that's a layup, that's a layup)
Layup, layup (that's a layup, that's a layup)
Sunshine on my window, let's go float
Pass me that pick and roll, off backboard
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup
Lookin' like a layup, layup, ay
Lookin' like a layup, layup, ay
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup
You been runnin' long enough to get a layup
You been drivin' long enough to get a layup
You been hustlin' long enough to get a layup
You been passed up long enough to get a layup
You been runnin' long enough to get a layup
You been drivin' long enough to get a layup
You been hustlin' long enough to get a layup
You been passed up long enough to get a layup

Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup
Sunshine on my window, let's go float
Pass me that pick and roll, off backboard
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup
Lookin' like a layup, layup, ay
Lookin' like a layup, layup, ay
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup

Layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup, layup
Layup, layup, layup4Embed
