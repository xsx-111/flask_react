Confetti Lyrics
Your confetti ain't even heavy, nigga
Got the win, I want the record, nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy

These niggas fuckin' up the game, this shit is so suspicious
You ain't buy it all unless you blew a ticket
All off in the VIP, but you ain't fuck them bitches
I'mma ball all summer just to flex for Christmas
Angel wings on the doors, I gotta suplex 'em
Money don't make you fly, that's just my perspective
Runnin' up the score to expose a bluff
'Cause nowadays gettin' a win just ain't enough
Fuck the check up last week, I got a new agenda
The last time I couldn't buy some shit, I can't remember
The last time I fucked the world, I might've bust the center
I bought a crib and set that bitch on top of Mount' Olympus
When you livin' that high up, it's hard to see the tension
I'm only sellin' game, I'm all out of simpin'
Grip the foreign like a trophy, gotta hold it steady
Fuck your party when your confetti ain't even heavy, nigga

Got the win, I want the record, nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy
We all off in the club like Sincere on Belly
Can't even drink my liquor, money on my celly
Accountant like, "You got a check, spend it when you ready"
I'm giving niggas hell, pray I go to Heaven
Nailin' in they coffin, the cost of them being off it
Ballin' since Iverson crossed you, winner's circle my office
Fuckin' off with these wins, you fuckin' up with this loss
Waiter forgot my season, I'm glad that they throwin' that salt
Might just throw a toss and holla, "Fuck it!"
'Cause when your wrist game know the grip changed, niggas' buckets
Chip rain in the strip game, hoes will bust it
Snakes come, chop they heads off
Cobra clutchin' on a meal ticket
Motherfuck you if you feel different
I caught a break, no debate, and you still fishin'
The genie out the bottle and you still wishin' on my downfall 'cause you petty
Confetti ain't even heavy, nigga

Got the win, I want the record, nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy7Embed
