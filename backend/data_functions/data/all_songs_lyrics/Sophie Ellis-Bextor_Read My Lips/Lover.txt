Lover Lyrics
I'm looking out
I'm looking in
I'm turning on and giving in
I'm lying low, I'm sinking

I'm going undercover
I'm gonna be your lover, lover

I'm getting up
I'm getting down
I want to move
I've come around
Look in my eyes
I want you

I'm going undercover
I'm gonna be your lover
I'm going undercover
I'm gonna be your lover, lover, lover

It's everyday
It's every night
It never sleeps it's always right
It overtakes
It's got me
I'm going undercover
I'm gonna be your lover
I'm going undercover
I'm gonna be your lover, lover, lover
I'm going undercover
I'm gonna be your lover
I'm going undercover
I'm gonna be your lover, lover, lover
I'm going undercover
I'm gonna be your lover
I'm going undercover
I'm gonna be your lover
I'm going undercover
I'm gonna be your loverEmbed
