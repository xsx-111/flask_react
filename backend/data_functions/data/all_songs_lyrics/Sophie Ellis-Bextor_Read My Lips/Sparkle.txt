Sparkle Lyrics
I'm only offering you love tonight
I'm only offering you this for life
I'm only answering your call tonight
I'm only answering your lust for life

Believe me, you're the only one
Believe me, you're the only one
Sparkle in my mind
Sparkle in my mind

It's always every single thing to me
It's always every single fantasy
It's always inescapable to me
It's always inescapable to see

Believe me, you're the only one
Believe me, you're the only one
Sparkle in my mind
Sparkle in my mind

I'm only offering you love tonight
I'm only offering you this for life
I'm only answering your call tonight
I'm only answering your lust for life
Believe me, you're the only one
Believe me, you're the only one
Sparkle in my mind
Sparkle in my mind
Sparkle in my mind
Sparkle in my mind
Sparkle in my...Embed
