The Universe Is You Lyrics
Read my lips
I don't want to
Get involved with relativity
Take my time
Use it wisely
You're controlling
Certain gravities

You're coming around so late in the day
I've been here before, I know what to say
You're moving the ground
You're making me feel as if the universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is you

Tell yourself
You can't have me
I rely on probability

You're coming around so late in the day
I've been here before, I know what to say
You're moving the ground
You're making me feel as if the universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is you
You're coming around so late in the day
I've been here before, I know what to say
You're moving the ground
You're making me feel as if the universe is you
You're coming around so late in the day
I've been here before, so I know what to say
You're moving the ground
You're making me feel as if the universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is you
The universe is youEmbed
