Leave the Others Alone Lyrics
Black and gold - a safe combination
Heaviness sets the seed for the next generation
You say we're so alike
Well, I wouldn't want to live
On the difference
No, I wouldn't want to live
On the difference
Sitting down at 10.000 feet
Nothing's artificial
It shouldn't be a word
I live on my dreams
Well, I'd never do anything to make them happen
No, I'd never do anything to make them happen

Suddenly I'm forced to think and make the right decision
I'm on the brink, you've put me in a position
I'll tell you what, I'll give you me
If you leave the others alone

Canvas cracks
Face unrecognizable
Eyes have a stony gaze
Moving's not advisable
I know who you are so
I don't feel the need to make conversation
No, I don't feel the need to make conversation
Suddenly I'm forced to think and make the right decision
I'm on the brink, you've put me in a position
I'll tell you what, I'll give you me
If you leave the others alone
Leave the others alone
Leave the others alone
Leave the others alone
Leave the others alone

I'll give you me
I'll give you me
I'll give you me
I'll give you me
I'll give you me
I'll give you me
I'll give you me
I'll give you meEmbed
