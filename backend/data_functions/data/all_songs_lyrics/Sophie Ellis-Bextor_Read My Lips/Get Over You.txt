Get Over You Lyrics
You think you've got your way
But, baby there's a catch
Don't need your foul play
Now you have met your match
You think you're in control
But that won't last that long
You thought you wore the crown
Honey, you were wrong

You had me taken in
But know I've found you out
And I won't go through that again
You've always had to win
You'll have to go without
You don't know where to stop
No, no, no, no

Go, go, go, go, go, I'll get over you
You drive me crazy up the wall
Think you're Mr. "Know It All"
Go, go, go, go, go, I'll get over you
You drive me crazy up the wall
Goodbye, Mr. "Know It All"
I let you have your say
You never compromised
Complaining everyday
About everything in sight
I've let your stay a while
Now i am getting bored
No substance in your style and
You're not the man i thought you were

You had me taken in
But know I've found you out
And I won't go through that again
You've always had to win
You'll have to go without
You don't know where to stop
I'll get over you
No, no, no, no

Go, go, go, go, go, I'll get over you
You drive me crazy up the wall
Think you're Mr. "Know It All"
Go, go, go, go, go, I'll get over you
You drive me crazy up the wall
Goodbye, Mr. "Know It All" (I'll get over you)
You think you've got your way
But, baby there's a catch
Don't need your foul play
Now you have met your match

No, no, no, no
Go, go, go, go, go, I'll get over you
You drive me crazy up the wall
Think you're Mr. "Know It All"
Go, go, go, go, go, I'll get over you
You drive me crazy, up the wall
Goodbye, Mr. "Know It All"
I'll get over you
I'll get over you
I'll get over you
I'll get over you1Embed
