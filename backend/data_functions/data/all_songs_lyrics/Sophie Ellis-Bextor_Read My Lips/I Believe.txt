I Believe Lyrics
Hold me down so I don't leap onto the wall
With the fever of it all
That would encourage mayhem
They're quite a rowdy crowd, do you think?
And I'm going to the peak of something
Lovely feeling, slippy breathing
Tell me how to break the news
There's no way that I can lose my love
And it's taken over me

I feel as if this love could last forever
As if my luck and hope have found each other
I feel as if I should have known, together
We make good sense to me and I believe

Who just said some girls don't get a second chance?
When I've toyed and I've romanced
I'm on the edge of something
Inner soothing, man-approving
Tell me how to take the news
There's no way that I can lose my love
And it's taken over me
I feel as if this love could last forever
As if my luck and hope have found each other
I feel as if I should have known, together
We make good sense to me and I believe
Ta, ta, ta, ra, ta, ta, ra, ra
Ta, ta, ta, ra, ta, ta, ra, ra
Ta, ta, ta, ra, ta, ta, ra, ra

I feel as if this love could last forever
As if my luck and hope have found each other
I feel as if I should have known, together
We make good sense to me and I believe
I feel as if this love could last forever
As if my luck and hope have found each other
I feel as if I should have known, together
We make good sense to me and I believe
We make good sense to me and I believe
We make good sense to me and I believe
I believe, I believe, I believeEmbed
