By Chance Lyrics
Take this down, turn it around
I am water underneath a bridge
So, what do I know?
Getting here must be a privilege
Should say something meaningful
If at all, just to fill the air
Or believe I adore you
Love you if I dare

By chance, when I turn out the light
I'm finding the right line
By chance, I could put this to right
Not in the rest of this lifetime

Let it slide, always inside
Isn't worth the indecision I hide?
So nowhere to go
Stimulating, no illusion
I should say something pivotal
Belittle how you let me down
Or believe I adore you
Love me if you dare
By chance, when I turn out the light
I'm finding the right line
By chance, I could put this to right
Not in the rest of this lifetime no, no

Look at you going places
See two faces
I know which to trace
I would be holding my breath
But things will stay the same, won't they?
Oh, I know

By chance, when I turn out the light
I'm finding the right line
By chance, I could put this to right
Not in the rest of this lifetime
By chance, when I turn out the light
I'm finding the right line
By chance, I could put this to right
Not in the rest of this lifetime
By chance, when I turn out the light
I'm finding the right line
By chance, I could put this to right
Not in the rest of this lifetime, not, no
Take it down, turn it round
Tell me we can work it out
Take it down, turn it round
Tell me we can work it out
Take it down, turn it round
Tell me we can work it out
Take it down, turn it round
Tell me we can work it out
Take it down, turn it round
Tell me we can work it out
Take it down, turn it round
Tell me we can work it out
Take it down, turn it round
Tell me we can work it out
Take it down, turn it round
Tell me we can work it outEmbed
