Take Me Home Lyrics
Heaven, heaven, heaven

Take me home, take me home
I know another place to be
Take me home, take me home
You deserve a girl like me
Come on, I know somewhere you can unwind
We can just disappear, now's the time
Take me home, take me home
Only fair I get my way
Take me home, take me home
Oh, it's gonna happen anyway
I know what's good for you
Don't pass me by
I will look after you, you'll be fine

I'm in heaven, I'll show you heaven
It's so much heaven
Let's make a move
Let's leave this world behind
I know you approve by the look in your eyes
I'm in heaven, I'll show you heaven
It's so much heaven
Take me home, take me home
I will show you where to walk
Take me home, take me home
Baby, let the people talk
We'll get away from here
I'm reading your mind
We can just disappear, now's the time

I'm in heaven, I'll show you heaven
Take me home
Oh, take me home
Oh, take me home

In this moment one night with you
All alone with nothing to loose

Let's make a move
Let's leave this world behind
I know you approve by the look in your eyes
I'm in heaven, I'll show you heaven
It's so much heaven
Take me home, take me home
Now's the time to follow me
Take me home
Come and live what ought to be
Take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home1Embed
