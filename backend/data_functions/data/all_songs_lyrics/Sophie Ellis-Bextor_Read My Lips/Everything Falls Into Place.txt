Everything Falls Into Place Lyrics
I know what you're thinking
It's all got to go
At times, driven along by the meaning
I need colours around me to fade

Everything falls into place
Everything falls in to favour
Everything falls into place
And then we all go mad
And throw it away
We all go mad and throw it away

I see what you're doing'
Makes sense after all
My hearts telling me I'm not mistaken
It feels better than I can believe

Everything falls into place (into place)
Everything falls into favour again
Everything falls into place
And then we all go mad
And throw it away (all go mad)
We all go mad and throw it away

Everything falls into place (into place)
Everything falls in to favour again
Everything falls into place
And then we all go mad
And throw it away (all go mad)
We all go mad and throw it away

We all go mad and we throw it away
I said we all go mad and we throw it away
We all go mad and we throw it away
I said we all go mad and we throw it away
We all go mad and we throw it away
I said we all go mad and we throw it away
We all go mad and we throw it away
I said we all go mad and we throw it awayEmbed
