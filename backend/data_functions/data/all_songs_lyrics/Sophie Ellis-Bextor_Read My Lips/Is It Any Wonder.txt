Is It Any Wonder Lyrics
Turn me down to the ground
I want to feel the coolness on my face
Lie me down, show me how
I can begin to hold you endlessly

And I don't sleep, so I don't dream of leaving
And when I wake I face the night
And I don't speak, I listen to the breathing
I sometimes think I hear my fate

So is it any wonder
That I'm finding someone in this place here next to me?
And is it any wonder that we found each other?
I've found another who meets the same
Is it any wonder?

Don't explain by its name
We write our words forever in the space
Who could say chance again
Chooses to bring together you and me?

Now I don't sleep so I don't dream of leaving
I lie awake and face the night
I lie awake and dream of you
So is it any wonder
That I'm finding someone in this place here next to me?
And is it and wonder that you made it here?
We found another who meets the same
And is it any wonder that I'm finding
Someone in this place here next to me?
And is it and wonder that you made it here?
I found another who meets the sameEmbed
