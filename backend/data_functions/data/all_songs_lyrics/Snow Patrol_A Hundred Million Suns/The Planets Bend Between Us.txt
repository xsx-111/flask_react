The Planets Bend Between Us LyricsThe winter's marked the earth, it's floored was frozen glass
You slip into my arms and you quickly correct yourself
Your freezing speech bubbles, seem to hold your words aloft
I want the smoky clouds of laughter to swim about me forever more
I will race you to the waterside
And from the edge of Ireland shout out loud
So they could hear it in America, it's all for you
The shells crack under our shoes like punctuation points
The planets bend between us a hundred million suns and stars
The sea filled in the silence before you sank those words
And now even in the darkness, I can see how happy you are
I will race you to the waterside
And from the edge of Ireland shout out loud
So they could hear it in America, it's all for you
It's all for you, it's all for you
The planets bend between us a hundred million suns and stars
The planets bend between us a hundred million suns and stars
The planets bend between us a hundred million suns and starsEmbed
