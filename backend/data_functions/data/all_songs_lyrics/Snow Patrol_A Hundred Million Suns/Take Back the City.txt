Take Back the City Lyrics
Take back the city for yourself tonight
I'll take back the city for me
Take back the city for yourself tonight
Whoa whoa whoa

God knows you've put your life into its hands
And it's both cradled you and crushed
But now it's time to make your own demands
Whoa whoa whoa

All these years later and it's killing me
Your broken records and words
Ten thousand craters where it all should be
Whoa whoa whoa

No need to put your words into my mouth
Don't need convincing at all
I love this place enough to have no doubt
Whoa whoa whoa
It's a mess
It's a start
It's a flawed work of art
Your city, your call
Every crack, every wall
Pick a side, pick a fight
Get your epitaph right
You can sing till you drop
Coz the fun just never stops
I love this city tonight
I love this city always
It bares its teeth like a light
And spits me out after days
But we're all gluttons for it
We know it's wrong and it's right
For every time it's been hit
Take back the city tonight

Tell me you never wanted more than this
And I will stop talking now
One perfect partner, one eternal kiss
Whoa whoa whoa

Take back the city for yourself tonight
I'll take back the city for me
Take back the city for yourself tonight
Whoa whoa whoa
It's a mess
It's a start
It's a flawed work of art
Your city, your call
Every crack, every wall
Pick a side, pick a fight
Get your epitaph right
You can sing till you drop
Cos the fun just never stops
I love this city tonight
I love this city always
It bares its teeth like a light
And spits me out after days
But we're all gluttons for it
We know it's wrong and it's right
For every time it's been hit
Take back the city tonight
I love this city tonight
I love this city always
It bares its teeth like a light
And spits me out after days
But we're all gluttons for it
We know it's wrong and it's right
For every time it's been hit
Take back the city tonight
I love this city tonight
I love this city always
I love this city tonight
I love this city alwaysEmbed
