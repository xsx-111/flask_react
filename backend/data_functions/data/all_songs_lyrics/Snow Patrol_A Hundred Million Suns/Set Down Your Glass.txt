Set Down Your Glass LyricsJust close your eyes
And count to five
Let's craft the only thing we know into surprise
Set down your glass
I painted this
To look like you and me forever as we're now
And I'm shaken then I'm still
When your eyes meet mine I lose simple skills
Like to tell you all I want is now
You sing and I'm killed
I'm just not the same
As I was a year ago and each minute since then
My jumper tears
As we take it off
And you say you'll sew me good as new and I know you will
And I'm shaken then I'm still
When your eyes meet mine I lose simple skills
Like to tell you all I want is nowEmbed
