Engines LyricsOnly the faintest only the faintest glance buries you buries me
So fire your engine see if I give a damn, we'll be dust instantly
Caught in a jet stream caught in a gorgeous howl all the world lost in noise
Use me forever use me for rocket fuel, I'll be air I'll be fire
You say you love me like the silence of the turning Earth
You say you love me like the endless roar of modern life
You say you love me like the laughter and the kissed back tears
You say you love me like the past the now the coming years
What will you remember what will you think of me after I say goodbye
Returning in bodies, plants and the sand you'll squeeze in between shoeless feet
I know I love you like the slivered gold of dying days
I know I love you like an ancient history brought to life
I know I love you like the sunlit water on your skin
I know I love you like the million times I never said
I know you love me like the silence of the turning Earth
I know you love me like the endless roar of modern life
I know you love me like the laughter and the kissed back tears
I know you love me like the past the now the coming yearsEmbed
