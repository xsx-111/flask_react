The Lightning Strike LyricsPart I: What If This Storm Ends?

What if this storm ends and I don't see you
As you are now, ever again?
A perfect halo of gold hair and lightning
Sets you off against the planet's last dance
Just for a minute, the silver forked sky
Lifts you up like a star that I will follow
And now it's found us like I have found you
I don't want to run, just overwhelm me

What if this storm ends and leaves us nothing
Except a memory? A distant echo
I want pinned down, I want unsettled
Rattle cage after cage until my blood boils
I want to see you as you are now
Every single day that I am living
Painted in flames, all peeling thunder
Be the lightning in me that strikes relentless

What if this storm ends and I don't see you
As you are now, ever again?
A perfect halo of gold hair and lightning
Sets you off against the planet's last dance
Just for a minute, the silver forked sky
Lifts you up like a star that I will follow
And now it's found us like I have found you
I don't want to run, just overwhelm me
Part II: The Sunlight Through the Flags

From here, the caravans are kids' toys
And I can hold them all in my palm
I watch the sea creep 'round the corner
It connects the dots from here to you
The sunlight burning through the loose flags
Painted high on white church walls
I chase my blood from brain to thumped heart
Until I'm out of breath for trying

Worry not, everything is sound
This is the safest place you've found
The only noise beating out is ours
Lacing our tea from honey jars

These accidents of faith and nature
They tend to stick in the spokes of you
But every now and then, the trend bucks
And you're repaired by more than glue
Worry not, everything is sound
This is the safest place you've found
The only noise beating out is ours
Lacing our tea from honey jars
Why don't you rest your fragile bones?
A minute ago, you looked alone
Stop waving your arms, you're safe and dry
Breathe in and drink up the winter sky
Part III: Daybreak

Slowly, the day breaks
Apart in our hands
And soft hallelujahs
Flow in from the church
The one on the corner
You said frightened you
It was too dark and too large
To find your soul in

Something was bound to go right, sometime today
All these broken pieces fit together
To make a perfect picture of us
It got cold and then dark, so suddenly and rained
It rained so hard, the two of us were the only thing
That we could see for miles and miles
And in the middle of the flood, I felt my worth
When you held onto me like I was your little life raft
Please know that you were mine as well
Drops of water hit the ground like God's own tears
And spread out into shapes like salad bowls
And basins and buckets for bailing out the flood

As motionless cars rust
On driveways and curbs
You take off your raincoat
And stretch out your arms
We both laugh out loud
And surrender to it
The sheer force of sky
And the cold magnet Earth

Something was bound to go right, sometime today
All these broken pieces fit together
To make a perfect picture of us
It got cold and then dark, so suddenly and rained
It rained so hard, the two of us were the only thing
That we could see for miles and miles
And in the middle of the flood, I felt my worth
When you held onto me like I was your little life raft
Please know that you were mine as well
Drops of water hit the ground like God's own tears
And spread out into shapes like salad bowls
And basins and buckets for bailing out the flood
