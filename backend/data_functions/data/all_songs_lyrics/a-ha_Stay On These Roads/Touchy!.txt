Touchy! Lyrics
Donna found us in her slow and dreamy way
I can't hear a word the waiter says to me
She's looking older now, the colour of her hair
She walks into the room too pleased to find me there

Me, I'm touchy, touchy you
Me, I'm touchy, and you know what to do
Me, I'm touchy, touchy, touchy you
Me, I'm touchy, and you know what to do

Both of us together in a room by ourselves
I sneeze to look around but there's no escape
What can I do? What can I say?
She's waiting for this moment to explain itself

Me, I'm touchy, touchy you
Me, I'm touchy, and you know what to do
Me, I'm touchy, touchy, touchy you
Me, I'm touchy, touching love is the best I can do

Hey, this time you've gone too far
Don't you know how touchy we are?
Hey, this time you've gone too far
(Come on, come on, don't you know I'm touchy?)
Don't you know how touchy we are?
Donna found me in her slow and dreamy way
Now she reads me what the paper says
The way she laughs at what I do
I'm waiting for this moment to explain itself through

Me, I'm touchy, touchy you
Me, I'm touchy, and you know what to do
Me, I'm touchy, touchy, touchy you
Me, I'm touchy, touching love is the best I can do

Hey, this time you've gone too far
Don't you know how touchy we are?
Hey, this time you've gone too far
(Come on, come on, don't you know I'm touchy?)
Don't you know how touchy we are?
Hey, this time you've gone too far
Don't you know how touchy we are?
Hey, this time you've gone too far
(Come on, come on, don't you know I'm touchy?)
Don't you know how touchy we are?

Me, I'm touchy, touchy you
Me, I'm touchy, and you know what to do
Me, I'm touchy, touchy, touchy you
Me, I'm touchy, touching love is the best I can doEmbed
