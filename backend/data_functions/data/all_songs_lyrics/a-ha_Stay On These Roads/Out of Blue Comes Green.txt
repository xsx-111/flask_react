Out of Blue Comes Green LyricsFather, my wings are clipped
See the steps that made me trip
Now I'm so lonely
Mother, time's frozen flame
Seem to linger in the rain
Holding me only
Like a river I'm flowing
And there's no way of knowing
If I'm coming or going
I need something to chain me down
Don't matter
My eyes have seen
For better
Out of blue comes green
Mother, I have gone wrong
Work my fingers to the bone
All I've been doing
Father, proud that I am
To be born into such hands
Your love so renewing
And I know I can lose it
Part of life, you can't choose it
As I touched the horizon
It just felt like I'd die soon
Don't matter
My eyes have seen
For better
Out of blue comes green
And like a river I'm flowing
I need something to chain me down
Don't matter
And now I've seen
For better
Out of, out of blue comes green
Don't matter
Out of blue comes greenEmbed
