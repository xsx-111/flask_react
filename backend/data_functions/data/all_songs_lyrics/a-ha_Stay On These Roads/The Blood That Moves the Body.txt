The Blood That Moves the Body LyricsIt's the way we feel
Tonight
As if it's all unreal
All right
My love
Won't you come back to
Our love
You know I'll react to
The blood that moves my body
Now covers the ground
The blood that moves the body
The blood that moves the body
There's nowhere to go
Tonight
Lend some warmth to our cold
And lonely lives
Red stains
On 'Eyes of a blue dog'
My pains
Fade as the interiors fog
The blood that moves my body
Now colours the ground
The blood that moves the body
The blood that moves the body
Not long ago
It hurt us so
A tremble through our lives
The love and care
The way we were
Now lost it's way at nights
It's the way we feel
Tonight
The blood that moves the body
The blood that moves the body
Not long ago
It hurt us so
A tremble through our lives
The love and care
The way we were
Now lost it's way at nights
It's the way we feel
Tonight
Lend some warmth to
Our cold and lonely lives
My love
Won't you come back to
Our love
You know we'll react to
The blood that moved our bodies
Now covers the ground
Now covers the ground
Covers the ground
The blood that moves the body
Covers the ground
The blood that moves the body
Covers the ground
The blood that moves the body
The blood that moves the body
The blood that moves the body1Embed
