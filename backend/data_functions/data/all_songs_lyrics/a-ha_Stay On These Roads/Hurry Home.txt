Hurry Home LyricsHurry home
Freight train running
I've been gone
Too long, honey
Why did I waste away
The only good thing left to save me
Hurry home
Freight train running
She's alone
Got no money
(She's alone
She got no money
I'm coming home
I've done my running)
I'm coming home
No more running
Why now should I deny
The only true thing left inside me
Coming home
No more running
Well, I'm doing right
For once in my life now
I'm doing right
For once in my life now
No more running (he's doing right)
No more running (he's doing right)
I'm doing right, doing right
No more running (he's doing right)
No more running (he's doing right)
No more running
Rolling countries, fields unfolding
I swear the winds are calling
Rolling countries, fields unfolding
I swear the winds are calling
So I hurry home
No more running
She's all alone
She's got no money
(She's alone
She's got no money
I'm coming home
I've done my running)
Why should I go and hide
The only true thing left inside me
Hurry home
Freight train running
Well, I'm doing right
For once in my life now
I'm doing right
For once in my life now
No more running (he's doing right)
No more running (he's doing right)
I'm doing right, doing right
No more running (he's doing right)
No more running any more (he's doing right)
No more running
No more running (he's doing right)
I'm going home now (he's doing right)
I'm going home
No more running (he's doing right)
(he's doing right)
I'm doing right, I'm doing right (he's doing right)
(He's doing right)
(He's doing right)
No more running (he's doing right)
I'm doing right (he's doing right)
For once in my life
I'm doing right
I'm doing right
I'm doing rightEmbed
