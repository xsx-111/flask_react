Stay On These Roads Lyrics
The cold has a voice
It talks to me
Stillborn by choice
It airs no need
To hold

Old man feels the cold
Oh, baby, don't 'cause I've been told

Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on, my love
We shall meet, I know, I know

Where joy should reign
These skies restrain
Shadows your love
The voice trails off again
Where joy should reign
These skies restrain
Shadows your love
The voice trails off again
Old man feels the cold
Oh, baby, don't 'cause I've been told

Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on, my love
You feel so weak, be strong
Stay on, stay on
We shall meet, I know, I know
I know, my love, I know

Feel the cold
Winter's gone, I'm on my own

Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on, my love
We will meet, I know
So stay on, I know
Stay, my love, stay on
We will meet, I know, I knowEmbed
