This Alone is Love LyricsThis alone is love
No small thing
This alone is love
That my love brings
And all of us
Who travelling by trapdoors
Our souls are a myriad of wars
And I'm losing everyone
It will make my last breath pass out at dawn, at dawn
It will make my body dissolve out in the blue, for you
Oh, baby, what can we do?
This alone is love
No small thing
This alone is love
That my love brings
And all of us
Who travelling by trapdoors
Our souls are a myriad of wars
And I'm losing everyone
It will make my last breath pass out at dawn, at dawn
It will make my body dissolve out in the blue, for you
It will make my body dissolve out in the blue, for you
Oh, baby, what can we do?
It will make my last breath pass out at dawn, at dawn
It will make my body dissolve out in the blue, for you
It will make my last breath pass out at dawn, at dawn
It will make my body dissolve out in the blue, for you
Oh, baby, what can we do?Embed
