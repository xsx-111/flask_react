Chicago Piano LyricsShow me one good paper guarantee
Oh my sweet promissory
Stern old men make a bed for me
I'm more than ready
One more confirmation of a new low
But I'm wired shut, just say so
Got word when the light passed through
I'm more than ready
To give it back
To give it back
Tight fist around a face out of history
Don't think I don't know what's over me
Over me with a numbing certainty
I'm more than ready
To give it back
To give it back
One more confirmation of a new low
But I'm wired shut, just say so
Got word when the light passed through
I'm more than ready
To give it back
To give it back
Duty bound to a guilt-fed guarantee
Good faith in the narrow path laid for me
Past time to declare sovereignty
I'm more than ready
To give it back
To give it backEmbed
