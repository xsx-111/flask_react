68 LyricsI got the message
Calling me back home
Don't ever let go
Six foot deep hole
The paths that cut so deep
From 30 years of sleep
Walking from the quarry to the wall
Rationalizing
All compromises
The paths that cut so deep
From 30 years of sleep
Walking from the quarry to the wall
I got the message
Calling me back homeEmbed
