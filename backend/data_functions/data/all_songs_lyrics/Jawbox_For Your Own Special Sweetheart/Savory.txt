Savory LyricsHey angel, consider your position
Framed to be consumed
Savory
Savoring your sympathy
Hey angel, fly over and bless me
See you feign surprise
That I'm all eyes
And you're all you need to be
Hey angel, whatever position
We consider fit to put you in
You'll protest your complicity
Easy now
One hand will wash the other
One hand will wash the other
Hey angel, fly over and bless me
See you feign surprise
But I'm all eyes
And we're all we need to be, need to be
Easy now
One hand will wash the other
One hand will wash the otherEmbed
