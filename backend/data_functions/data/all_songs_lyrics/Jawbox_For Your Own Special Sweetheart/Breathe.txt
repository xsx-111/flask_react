Breathe LyricsA minute, a second
A half-life, a minus
A segment, a blinder
Elective detention
It's secession time
Paid for by cutting backwards
It's election time
Letting every insult become presidential injury
(I'm begging you just hold my head up)
This last disgrace, breathe in my face
Bleed in distaste, bless this amen
Final lesson
A minute, a second
A half-life, a minus
A second reminder
Selective attention
It's secession time
Paid for by cutting backwards
It's insurrection time
Letting every insult be accepted into history
(I'm begging you just hold my head up)
This last disgrace, breathe in my face
Bleed in distaste, bless this amen
Final lesson (Na-na-na)
Final lesson
This last disgrace, bless this amen
Final lesson (Na-na-na)
Final lesson (Na-na-na)
Final lesson (Na-na-na)
Final lesson (Na-na-na)
