Reel LyricsListen
There is no use in trying to explain
Listen
Is it your fault she made those cuts again?
To let out blood she thought it made her bad
Or maybe just to cut you out instead
Keep your head
Cauterize
Wounds you hide
Burn them clean
Show no way inside
Listen
The sound is down now you should hear yourself
Shouting from the bottom of a well
Attempts repeated infinitely feel useless now
Cauterize
Wounds you hide
Burn them clean
Show no way inside
Reel on a repeating loop
Reel on a repeating loop
Listen, listen, listen, listen
Cauterize
Wounds you hide
Burn them clean
Show no way inside
Cauterize
Wounds you hide
Burn them clean
Show no way insideEmbed
