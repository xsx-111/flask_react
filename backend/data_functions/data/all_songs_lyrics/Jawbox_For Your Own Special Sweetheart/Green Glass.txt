Green Glass LyricsDaylight
Unwelcome eye on your underground
Green glass
Roads over that uneven ground
Shut out
Reasons that make an uneasy mind
Hold out
For your sweet new valentine
If it's a number you want
Could be already assigned
And if it's a number you want
Why can't you take it?
Bright eyes
You'll lose your shine in one more round
Green glass
Refracts the light and draws you down
If it's a number you want
Could be already assigned
And if it's a number you want
Why can't you take itEmbed
