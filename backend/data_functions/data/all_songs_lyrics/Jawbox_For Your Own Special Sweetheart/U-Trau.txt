U-Trau LyricsFourteen days in the dreamhouse
In the binder
Keep on drinking
It's some arrival
Some adjustment
To have to view unblinking
Falling down
(Ageing in place)
Calling out
Falling down
(Ageing in place)
Calling out
Don't go too far not bad
Just nostalgic for lost time
Bought the second-rate product in demand
Credit still due
Over your head
Cardboard dust coats everything
Falling down
(Ageing in place)
Calling out
Falling down
(Ageing in place)
Calling out
Don't go too far not bad
Just nostalgic for lost time
Bought the second-rate product in demand
Bought the second-rate product in demandEmbed
