LS/MFT LyricsNarrowing his eyes
God only knew what she'd try
Obsessed with drawing lines
What's wrong with saying, "this is mine?"
He says her pain subsides
He only wants a quiet mind
Control is the prize
A different mark for every time
He thought he'd been defied
He said she left some marks on him inside
Keep your eyes on me
Never lie to me
Blows to shape what you see
You stayed willingly
She's healing up just fine
To take what's coming up next time
Striking with an open hand
Mind set even as sense unwinds
Tightening the ties that bind
The cells are self-assigned
Keep your eyes on me
Never lie to me
Blows to shape what you see
You stayed willingly
Keep your eyes on me
Never lie to me
Blows to shape what you see
You stayed willinglyEmbed
