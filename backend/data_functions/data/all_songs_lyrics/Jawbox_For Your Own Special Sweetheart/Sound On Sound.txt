Sound On Sound LyricsI'm behind you
You can't see me
I watch you
When you are near me
You say words
The sound is missing
I just look and watch and listen
Sound on sound
Love is just
Infatuation
You are me
And I am you
Looking back
It's just reflections
It's just something else to do
Sound on sound
Love is just
Infatuation
You are me
And I am you
Looking back
It's just reflection
It's just something else to do
Sound on soundEmbed
