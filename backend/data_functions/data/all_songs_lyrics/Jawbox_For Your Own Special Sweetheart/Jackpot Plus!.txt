Jackpot Plus! LyricsSweet Dempsey waiting on a number
Cups his sweating hand around dice and blows
Breathes his reeking trust on tumbling bones
In love with the air around a hundred thousand bad throws
All nerve and no brain
All nerve, no brain
It's jackpot plus in which he trusts
Someday I--
Someday I--
Sweet baby sucking on a number
Sweet Dempsey gladly trips switch after switch
He can feel himself drain out through his fingertips
Uneasy union, the conception of a near miss
All nerve and no brain
All nerve, no brain
It's jackpot plus in which he trusts
Someday I--
Someday I--
Keep dropping it in cool on the machine
Keep dropping it in, dropping it in
Dropping it in
Someday I--
Someday I--
Someday I--Embed
