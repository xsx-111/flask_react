Cruel Swing LyricsClean!
He could still be the big white knight
A man so blessed with foresight, foresight, foresight
The page wants to stay white
The page wants to stay white
Fixed, lost
Fixed, lost
Clean!
Martial rhythm's been locked in
The king is hound's-tooth clean
As anyone can see
As anyone can see
The page wants to stay white
The page wants to stay white
Fixed, lost
Fixed, lostEmbed
