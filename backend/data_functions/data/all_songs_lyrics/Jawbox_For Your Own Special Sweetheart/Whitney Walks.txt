Whitney Walks LyricsHe says
This is more than just a line
This is more than just free time
These doldrums squat in rows two by two
And in his pocket
He holds a catholic and a key
Keeps both feet on the ground
(This is you)
He says
This is not quite time to think
This water's not so bad to drink
Then chokes a laugh and walks away
And in his pocket
He holds a catholic and a key
With both feet on the ground
(This is you)Embed
