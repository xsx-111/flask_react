My Stuff Lyrics
Say no way, we won't let them grow up that way
Things have changed but some things have stayed the same

Leave me without a God, without belief, without a cause
Without a path that I should take, without a choice that I should make
Such an easy thought and now I had it but I lost it
I guess I need your help and now I guess I need your help and now I...

It's just my stuff, it's just myself
It's just my...
Leave me without a God, without belief, without a cause
Without a path that I should take, without a choice that I should make
Such an easy thought and now I had it but I lost it
I guess I need your help and now I guess I need your help and now I...Embed
