Taste Test Lyrics
Bad thoughts, bad car, bad drive
A mess, a lot, a lie
(Where are you now?)
I can't be alone tonight
(Where did you go?)
I'm tired, I'm hurt, I'm fine
(Where are you now?)

You've always got me guessing why
(That's how things happen to find you)
Nothing the same after tonight
(And how am I gonna tell you?)
Nothing is gonna make it right
(Don't start, I'm not gonna fight you)
Keep the house quiet, dark tonight
(Could be I'm not gonna find you)

One sour, one sweet, one lime
Taste both, taste yours, taste mine
(Where are you now?)
Too late, too long, no light
(Where did you go?)
I can't see a thing tonight
(Where are you now?)
You've always got me guessing why
(That's how things happen to find you)
Nothing the same after tonight
(And how am I gonna tell you?)
Tell me how I can make it right
(Don't start, I'm not gonna fight you)
Tell me what's going on inside
(Could be I'm not gonna find you)


You've always got me guessing why
(That's how things happen to find you)
Nothing the same after tonight
(And how am I gonna tell you?)
Nothing is gonna make it right
(Don't start, I'm not gonna tell you)
Tell me what's going on inside
(Could be I'm not gonna find you)Embed
