The Mysterious Vanishing of Electra LyricsMy feet are not enough
My feet are not enough
My feet are not enough
My feet are not enough
To save me
To save me
His search is not enough
His search is not enough
To find me
To find me
My love is not enough
My love is not enough
To save me
To save me
You search through the forest and the bottomless sea
And you cry
Push the trees, push the sky, push the air aside
You look at their faces and their meaningless loss
And you cry
Who is she?
Who is she, who is she, who is she, to say good bye?
