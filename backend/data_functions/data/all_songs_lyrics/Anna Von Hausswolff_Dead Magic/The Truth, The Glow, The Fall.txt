The Truth, The Glow, The Fall Lyrics
After the fall
After the fall
After the fall
I'll find you
After the fall
After the fall
After the fall
I'll find you
Unexpected out from nowhere
Was the truth told for me
From his heart and from his sadness
He sadly sang for me
Can you hear the song?
Can you hear the song?
Can you hear the song?
It haunts you
It haunts you

My sweet John
My dear John
Oh my love
My sweet John
My dear John
Oh my love
Are we touching the magic?
Are we wearing the white angel's glow
Surrounded by mountains
In a valley free from the snow
Will we fall?
Will we fall where we fall?
Will we fall?
Will we fall where we fall?
Oh down in the river
Down to the bodies below
Oh down in the chaos
Driven by black magic glow
My sweet John
My dear John
Oh my love
Will we fall?
Will we fall where we fall?

Feel the fall
Feel the fall
Feel the fall
Feel the fall
Feel the fall
Feel the fall
Feel the fall
Feel the fall2Embed
