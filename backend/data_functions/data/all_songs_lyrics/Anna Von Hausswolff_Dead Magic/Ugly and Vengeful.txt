Ugly and Vengeful Lyrics
I’m restless
I’m older
I’m heavy
Like a stone
Forgiven, foresaken
I’m staring
At my bones
Die for the
Son
For the stone
For the son
I said die for the
Son
For the God
'Cause he wants to have my gloria
He wants to have my gloria
He wants to have my gloria
I am restless
And I’m older
And I’m heavy
Like a stone
Stone
Stone
Stone
