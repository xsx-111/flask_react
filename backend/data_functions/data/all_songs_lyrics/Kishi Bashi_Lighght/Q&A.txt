Q&A Lyrics
You are the answer to my question
You are my accomplice in a crime
You are my wing woman and did I mention
We were together in another life?
In that dreaming, you probably were my wife

Hotaru Hotaru
Futari no yume wo mireru hotaru no
Hotaru Hotaru
Tsuneru to yume ga
Sameru hotaruyoru

'Cause we worshipped in sin for fun
Two melting candles against the sun
Modern angels, they broke our wings in the wind
For what?
Decorated by man and time
Ornamental and quite devine
Manifested in their commitment to
Flay our minds

You are the answer to my question
You are my accomplice in a crime
You are my wing woman and did I mention
We were together in another life?
In that moment, you probably were my wife
Hotaru Hotaru
Futari no yume wo mireru hotaru yoru

In the twilight, they danced and played
The fireflies, they go light like cray
In the dreaming we struck each other and prayed
For pain

You are the answer to my question
You are my accomplice in a crime
You are my wing woman and did I mention
We were together in another life?
In that dreaming, you probably were my wife4Embed
