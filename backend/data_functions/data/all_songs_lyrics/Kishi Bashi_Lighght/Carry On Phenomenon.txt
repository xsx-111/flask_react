Carry On Phenomenon Lyrics
What a beautiful life away
Naked from all the Apollonians
For their radiance shines on and on
And on and on and on...
When endowed with promises
Majestic with all the stallions
But the fateful truth burns on and on
And on and on and on...
When in doubt you made me stay
Connected in with the beyond and on
Like when the radio plays on and on
And on and on and on...

So the earth would dry of song if I sang you one
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon
So you got the best of me so amazingly
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon and on and on...

Oh the way that you waved to me
It awakened me in shock and awe
During the reigning age of Solomon and on
And on and on and on...
My nefarious state of mind
Illuminate in every song
For your serenade plays on and on
And on and on and on...

So the earth would dry of song if I sang you one
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon
So you got the best of me so amazingly
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon and on and on...

So the earth would dry of song if I sang you one
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon
So you got the best of me so amazingly
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon
So the earth would dry of song if I sang you one
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon
So you got the best of me so amazingly
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon and on2Embed
