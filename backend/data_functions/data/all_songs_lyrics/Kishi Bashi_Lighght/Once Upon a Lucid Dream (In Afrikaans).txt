Once Upon a Lucid Dream (In Afrikaans) LyricsCount off to the feel of your beat yeah
Make it rain on my melody
Am I man enough to man this sunny afternoon?
I fell off from the throne of the maker
Made a mess of a parody
I can count a little fun as many things too soon
And your radiance came around
On the heels of a magical mystery
And the beauty of your major key
The ambitions as a survivor
Make stronger a man of me
But the enemy of mine is staring back as you
I need to know this love is real
I want to feel the sadness
I want to know how it tastes
When you throw it at the moon
I want my heart to be cold as ice
I want to take it back in time
Dig a grave with my teeth
I want to bleed in the rain
I want to feel my very chest ripped open at the seams
I really want to know
Was it a dream?
The courageous on the horizon
Made many a soldier weep
Was there anybody around to bury them at noon?
And the fortunes of the Messiah
Gave hope to the progeny
That the sky was in a shade of lighter blue than you
But your radiance came around on the heels of a magical mystery
Made a suitor and a slave of me
The melange of all the dividers
Made everything incomplete
And the only thing to do is stare at the moon
I want to know how it tastes
When you throw it at the moon
I want my heart to be cold as ice
I want to take it back in time
Dig a grave with my teeth
I want to bleed in the rain!
I want to feel my very chest ripped open at the seams
I want to lead you by your breast, animated and obscene
When I'm blinded in the sunlight will this love be real?
Or was it a dream?1Embed
