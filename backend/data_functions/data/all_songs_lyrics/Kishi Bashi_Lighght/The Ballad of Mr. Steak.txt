The Ballad of Mr. Steak Lyrics
Did fate mistake us for a pair of star crossed lovers?
The savory ending wasn't drowned in salt and pepper
And as we danced together, I cried a funny smile
As I felt you awake in the heat of feast
Now you're gone forever now inside myself here we go

Ooh Mr. Steak, you were Grade A

I believe when a man's in love he'll do anything he wants
He'll do anything that will come to his mind
And like that, Mr. Steak was in love every minute of his mind:
He's stepping left and right cha-cha
He came to me in a package of delight
Every other meal paled in his shadow ooh
He picked me, not the other way around
He came bursting at the seams
He pranced around la la

He brought the 1 2 3 he brought the four on the floor
He loved to move he was everything and more
And every bite just made him dance more and more
He loved to
Mr. Steak you were Grade A

Mr. Steak, he's such a bachelor at heart
He'd never met another cut that likes to booty booty shaky shake
Do you believe that a steak couldn't love
Or is hard to manage the fact of meat jerkin to the beat
But Mr. Steak he is practically an animal of joy
The rarest of all cuts: tenderloin
It was a tragedy of unimaginable fate his legend lives across the land
Hand in hand here we go
He brought the 1

He brought the 1 2 3 he brought the four on the floor
He loved to move he was everything and more
And every bite just made him dance more and more
He loved to

Mr. Steak you were Grade A6Embed
