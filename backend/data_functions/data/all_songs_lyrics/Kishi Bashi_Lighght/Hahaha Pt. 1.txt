Hahaha Pt. 1 LyricsWhen we were Manta Rays floating as carelessly
With every wave we felt what we were dreamed to say
And in our fantasy we'd sting each other see?
And try to sweep the leg but we have none hahaha
Silly girl are you mad at me?
With every game we played, we won us endless fame
And in the summer rain
We'd fall in love again
We'd turn each other on and off and on and on yeah
And if your love for me was an anomaly
Would you make up your death just to break up with me?
As in our parody we'd mock each other see
And so we'd laugh together and ever and ever hahaha
Silly girl are you mad at me?
We'd never feel the same till we break up again
And in the summer rain
We'd fall in love again
We'd turn each other on and off and on and on yeahEmbed
