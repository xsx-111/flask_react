Hahaha Pt. 2 LyricsI laughed at the ocean
We were amused by the sea
We laughed at the ocean
Charmed life have weâ€¦
Aah ha ha ha ha
Lau-ghing at
The ocean we were
Aah ha ha ha ha
Bet-ter than
Never wanting to see
Ha ha ha ha
I never laughed at the edge of the ocean
We'd never gone to the edge of the sea
I never laughed at the edge of the ocean
It's far better than wanting never to seeEmbed
