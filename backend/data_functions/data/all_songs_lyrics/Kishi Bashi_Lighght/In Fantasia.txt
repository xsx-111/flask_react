In Fantasia LyricsIn Fantasia the mirrors lie to us they plant a seed
One by one we build an empire where devils roam and breed
Fading sunsets... to forget them is the mark of death
As we break in through the window
Of mind and greed
Darkened bridges sink away into the brackishness
Swirling sin into a rainbow of atrophy
When the winters help the golden autumns take it's leave
Spawning passages for vampires
To suck and feed
Kareru kareru
Subetega kareteruno
Fuyuno sabaku fuyuno sabaku ga hirogaru
Warerano yoruga kuru warerano yoruga hajimaru
Karehaga kareru warerano fuyuno sabaku
Waking insights born of jealousy and faithlessness
Gave us strength among the gentiles of modernity
In Fantasia the spirits hide from us they cannot bleed
Innocence is not a virtue in times of need
Endless twilight... if only stars would show their faithful stare
In this world of fading memories, we'd cease to be
In Fantasia the air is dense to me it hurts to scream
At windless castles in the darkness, too faint to see...1Embed
