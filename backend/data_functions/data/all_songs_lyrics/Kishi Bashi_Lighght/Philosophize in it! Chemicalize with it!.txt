Philosophize in it! Chemicalize with it! Lyrics
And if you fly
Into the sky
And if your body is a penny and dime
Ready to throw it in the fountain of my many monies
And if you push it I will take you offline
Philosophize in it! Chemicalize with it!

I fell in love you the only way I know, oo-hoo!
I went for many miles until I couldn't go
Concerned but anyways, I didn't even know about you and me
I made a guess about your craziness and no, oo-hoo!
I didn't think about how many boys you've been with before
Concerned but anyways, I love everything about you

And if your body is a penny and dime
Ready to throw it in the fountain of my many monies
And if you push it I will take you offline
Philosophize in it! Chemicalize with it!

Picture our wedding, it'd be summer sour and summer sweet
We'd paint the ceiling red, we'd go to the Greek and straight to the street
Concerned but never bleak, we'd find the day about you and me
And with our eyes we shall see (Eyes we shall see)
Between you and me (Me-e-e)
Who's crazier for the other one? (â€”zier for the other one?)
It's me (It's me)
It's you (It's you)
(It's me)
No, it's you

And if you fly
Into the sky
And if you push it I will take you offline

And if your body is a penny and dime
Ready to throw it in a fountain of my many monies
And if you push it I will take you offline
Philosophize in it! Chemicalize with it!

And if your body is a penny and dime
Ready to throw it in a fountain of my many monies
And if you push it I will take you offline
Philosophize in it! Chemicalize with it!7Embed
