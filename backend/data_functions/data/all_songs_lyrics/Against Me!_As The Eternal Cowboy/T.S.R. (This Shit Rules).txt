T.S.R. (This Shit Rules) LyricsThe party's over
A CD skipping
It's the same hook repeating
Grows more grating with each passing second
And the walls contain a resonation, laughter and conversation
It was fun while it lasted but now we should be going
I hope everybody had a real good time
The hospitality's partaken, my head is flying, my heart's racing to keep up
And I hope I haven't overdone it, no
I hope my body can take it, I hope I make the occasion
It's only this fucked up I start realizing all this living is just dying
And if these are my friends, if this is my home, if this is how i spend my nights
How I communicate and demonstrate a love of life
My eyes roll into the back of my head
If these are the last words that I've ever said
No, I'm not ready to die just yetEmbed
