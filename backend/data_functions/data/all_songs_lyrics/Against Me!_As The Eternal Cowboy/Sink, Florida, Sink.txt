Sink, Florida, Sink Lyrics
Not one more word tonight
Between here and there
We'll put a distance the size of the ocean
So now this heart can beat a skipping rhythm
As the cadence carries me
Well, I almost drift away
Far enough to forget
But when it comes, you cannot hesitate
And when found I will write
An account and seal it in an envelope
Addressed
To your last known residence

Woah, woah-oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh-ah-oh
Woah, oh-oh-ah
Woah, woah-oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh-ah-oh
Woah, oh-oh-ah

And we sink, and we drown
And what is lost can never be found
Well, these arms did swim until the lungs pulled in
But panic was lost in a deep understanding
That you will see what is wrong with everything
What is wrong with you and me
They make all the right reasons to fuck it up
You're gonna fuck it up
Woah, woah-oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh-ah-oh
Woah, oh-oh-ah
Woah, woah-oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh-ah-oh
Woah, oh-oh-ah1Embed
