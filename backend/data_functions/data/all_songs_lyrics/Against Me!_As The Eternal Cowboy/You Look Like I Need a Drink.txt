You Look Like I Need a Drink Lyrics
In the closest alley, in the first doorway
He pushed up against her and closed his eyes
He said, "This is probably the worst decision that I've ever made."
She laughed and smiled
She said, "I'm sure you do this all the time, right right right right right?"

And as the morning came and the city woke
And in the building people all went to work
As their rides out of town came they parted ways
She said, "Do you know when you're coming back again?"
Dig it deeper, deeper, and farther still
Bury it up and over and into the ground
All these lies will grow in ways that we never thought possible

If you quiet down, down, down, so soft of a sound
You can hear it all coming back after you
Quiet down, down, down, so soft of a sound
You can hear it all coming back after you

And now you want to take it back, you think you might have fucked up
Waking dreams of concrete, deafening panic, cracked skull
There's yelling all around, get up, get up, please start breathing
And the moment will come when you finally realize
The results of decisions and choices in your life
Can you hear it all coming back after you?
Down, down, down, so soft of a sound
Can you hear it all coming back after you?
Going down, down, down, so soft of a sound
Can you hear it all coming back after you?1Embed
