Slurring the Rhythms LyricsHere were cameras brought for pictures to hold
All the small details, we left them all behind, we left them all behind
There was a place for, there was a time for
We arrive to leave again
There was a point in a keepsake when you run from collections
I know one day there will be a book or a song line to remind me
How much it meant to me, hungry exhausted and alone
Direction is a point, direction is a purpose
Destination is a reason to live out this heart beat

Whaoh oh oh oh oh
Whaoh oh oh oh oh
Whaoh oh oh
Whaoh oh oh
Whaoh oh oh oh oh
Whaoh oh oh oh oh
Whaoh whaoh whaoh
This could be any day
This could be any year
This could be any stage
This could be any city
All that matters is were moving on
The roadside grave yards pass
We escape we escape we escape we escape repeating
And this construction of a nation
Building up destruction of a nation
Tearing down to build again oh oh
Trailer tail lights like the ghosts of the last
To escape those pasts en route to arrival

We're never going home
Whaoh whaoh whaoh whaohEmbed
