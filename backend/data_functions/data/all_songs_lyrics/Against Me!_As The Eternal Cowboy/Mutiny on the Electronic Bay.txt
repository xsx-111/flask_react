Mutiny on the Electronic Bay LyricsIt's an into the sunrise aesthetic
Let's pretend this is an informed consent
That class division doesn't make an infantry
There is no incentive, no franchise opportunities
And the magazine spreads of fashion models gas masks in hand
It's ok, it's all right, these are situations we learn to live in
When an invasion can bring a country its freedom
Then unconsciousness is true happiness
No, no, I don't know what to sayEmbed
