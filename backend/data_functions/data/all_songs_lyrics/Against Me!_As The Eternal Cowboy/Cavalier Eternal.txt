Cavalier Eternal Lyrics
Girl I'm sorry but I'm leaving
We're both at fault, we're both to blame
And it wasn't the other men cause there were other women
This just isn't love, it's just the remorse of a loss of a feeling
Even if I stayed it just wouldn't be the same

Double this drink up into the, tallest glass you got
You know I ain't used to sleeping all alone
Gonna make it to the moon tonight on a one-way kamikaze flight
If I could get so high I'll leave behind my problems
Take 'em out with the empty bottles

Oh girl, I'm sorry but I'm leaving
We're both at fault, we're both to blame
And it wasn't the other men cause there were other women
This just isn't love, it's just the remorse of a loss of a feeling
Even if I stayed it just wouldn't be the same

Me and this guitar are going swinging blind into the unknown
You know a song and a stage is all I ever needed of a home
Someday I will call from a payphone in a truck stop on the road
And you'll tell me how much better off you've been on your own
So girl, I'm sorry but I'm leaving
We're both at fault, we're both to blame
And it wasn't the other men cause there were other women
This just isn't love, it's just the remorse of a loss of a feeling
Even if I stayed it just wouldn't be the sameEmbed
