Caribou Lyrics
I live cement
I hate this street
Give dirt to me
I've got lament
This human form
Where I was born
I now repent

Caribou
Caribou
Caribou
Ooh
Repent!
Re-pe-ent!

Give me white
Ground to run
Air for gun
Let me knife
Knife me let
I will get
What I like
Caribou
Caribou
Caribou
Ooh
Repent!
Re-pe-ent!5Embed
