Ed Is Dead Lyrics
Her head is in a bitter way
Her brain's on fire
She's just looking for the perfect wave
It's her brain's desire
I'll think of her when I walk the strand
On this true Hermosa night
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Ed is dead
Ed is dead
Ed is dead, ha huh, huh
Ed is dead

She's just riding in stupid bliss
With music on her bars
Her face burning in the L.A. sun
She got no, got no fear of cars
I'll dedicate my strand cruiser
To the memory of her own
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Ed is dead
Ed is dead
Ed is dead, ha huh, ha huh
Ed is, yeah, Ed is...
Ed is dead!
Ed is, yeah, Ed is...
Ed is dead! Ha huh! Ha huh!
Ed is, Ed is...

Ed is dead!
Ed, a-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
(Ed is dead!)
E-I-D! E-I-D! (Ed is dead)
E-I-D, no, no, no, no, no!Embed
