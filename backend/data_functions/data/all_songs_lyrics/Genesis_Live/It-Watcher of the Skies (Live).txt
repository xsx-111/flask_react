It/Watcher of the Skies (Live) Lyrics
When it's cold, it come slow
When it's warm, just watch it grow
All around me
It is here, it is now
Just a little bit of it, can bring you up or down
Like the supper, it is cooking in your hometown
It's supper, it is eggs
It is in between your legs
It is walking on the moon
Leaving your cocoon
When you eat right through it, you see everything alive
It is inside the spirit, with enough grit to survive
If you think this is pretentious, and you've been taken for a ride
Look across the mirror sonny, before you choose decide
It is here, it is now
It is here, it is now
It is real, this is Rael
Yes, you know what we know
That it's only knock and know all, but we like it!
It's only knock and know all, but we like it!
It's only knock and know all, but we like it!
Oh yes, we like it!
It's only knock and know all, but we like it!
Yeah!
It's only knock and know all!
It's only knock and know all!
It's only knock and know all!
It's only knock and know all!
It's only knock and know all, but we like it!
Thank you, cheer!
