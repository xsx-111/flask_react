Misunderstanding (Live) LyricsThere must be some misunderstanding
Ooh, there must be some kind of mistake
Cause you left me in the rain for hours
And you were late
Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
Well I checked your number twice, and i don't understand it
Well I went home
Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
I never dreamed I'd have this feeling
But seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night
There must be some misunderstanding
Aw listen, there must be some kind of mistake
Cause you left me in the rain for hours
And you were late
Since then I've been running around trying to find you
I went to the places that you always go
Rang your house but got no answer
So jumped in my car, and i went round there
I still don't believe it
He was just leaving
There must be some misunderstanding
Oh there must be some kind of mistake
You know there must be some misunderstanding
Oh there must be some kind of mistake
There must be, there must be, oh oh
Misunderstanding
There must be, there must be, oh oh
Misunderstanding
There must be, there must be, no no
Misunderstanding
There must be, there must be, aw no
Misunderstanding
Misunderstanding, Misunderstanding
There must be, there must be, oh oh
Misunderstanding
There must be, there must be some kind of misunderstanding
You know there must be something, must be something, must be something, must be some, misunderstanding
You know there must be something, must be something, must be something, must be some, misunderstanding
You know there must be something, must be something, must be something, must be some, misunderstanding
You know there must be something, must be something, must be something, must be some, misunderstandingEmbed
