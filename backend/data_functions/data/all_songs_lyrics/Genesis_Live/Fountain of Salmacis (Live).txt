Fountain of Salmacis (Live) LyricsFrom a dense forest of tall, dark, pinewood
Mount Ida rises, like an island
Within a hidden cave, nymphs had kept a child:
Hermaphroditus, son of gods, afraid of their love, ooh...
As the dawn creeps up the sky
The hunter caught sight of a doe
In desire for conquest
He found himself within a glade, he'd not beheld before
"Where are you my father!
Give wisdom to your son!"
And as his strength began to fail
He saw a shimmering lake
A shadow in the dark green depths
Disturbed the strange tranquility
"The waters are disturbed!
Some creature has been stirred!"
As he rushed to quench his thirst
A fountain spring appeared before him
And as his heated breath, brushed through the cool mist
A liquid voice called, "Son of god, drink from my spring"
The water tasted strangely sweet
Behind him the voice called again
He turned and saw her, in a cloak of mist alone
And as he gazed, her eyes were filled with the darkness of the lake
"We shall be one!
We shall be joined as one!"

"Away from me cold-blooded woman!
Your thirst is not mine!"
"Nothing will cause us to part!
Hear me O' Gods!"
Unearthly calm, descended from the sky, oh...
And then their flesh and bones, were strangely merged
Forever to be joined as one

The creature crawled into the lake
A fading voice, was heard:
"And I beg, that all who touch this spring!
May share my fate!"
"We are the one!
We are the one!"
Both had given everything they had, oh, oh...
A lover's dream had been fulfilled at last
Forever lost, beneath the lakeEmbed
