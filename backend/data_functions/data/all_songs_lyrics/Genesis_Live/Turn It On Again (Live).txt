Turn It On Again (Live) LyricsAll I need is a TV show, that and the radio
Down on my luck again, down on my luck again
I can show you, I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you, I can show you some of the people in my life
It's driving me mad, you know it's just another way of passing the day
I, I get so lonely when she's not there
I, I, I, I...
You're just another face that I know from a TV show
But I have known you for so very long, I feel you like a friend
Can't you do anything for me, can I touch you for a while
Can I meet you another day and we will fly away
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life, my life, my life, you wouldn't believe!
It's driving me mad it's just another way of passing the day
I, I get so lonely when she's not there
I, I, I, I...
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on againEmbed
