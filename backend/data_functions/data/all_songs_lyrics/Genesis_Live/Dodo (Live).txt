Dodo (Live) LyricsToo big to fly, dodo ugly so dodo must die
Dog go with fear on its side, can't change, can’t change the tide
Dog baiter, agitator, keeps asking questions, says he wants to know why
Aw there ain't no reason that money can't buy
Aw mink he pretty, so mink he must die, must die
Must die
Sun he giving life in his light
It’s part of the system
Friend to man, friend to the trees
No friend to the snowman
But where does he go and what does he do?
Does he meet with the mole, the stream, the cloud
And end up at the bottom of the sea
Fish he got a hook in his throat
Fish he got problems
But where does he go and what does he do?
Does he think he's too small, to poor a haul
Who'll end up being thrown back in the sea
I'm back in the sea
Caretaker, horror movie
Only one eye, only needs one boot
Aw sweet lady, she knows she looks good
The Vacuum coming for the bright and the brute
Big noise, black smoke
He's so pig-headed couldn't see the joke
Aw but it ain't funny
Ask the fly on the wall
It's only living
It don’t matter at all, at all
At all
Pimp, he make you drool and grunt
Well he’s got an answer
One he got a dream of love
It's deep as the ocean
Ocean, ocean, ocean
But where does he go?
And what does he do?
And the siren team with Davy Jones
And end up at the bottom of the sea
I’m back in the sea
I'm back in the sea
I'm back, in the sea!
Meanwhile lurking by a stone in the mud
Two eyes looked to see what I was and
Then something spoke and this is what
It said to me.......
Clothes of brass and hair of brown
Seldom need to breathe
Don't need no wings to fly
Ooh and a heart of stone
And a fear of fire and water
Who am I?
Clothes of brass and hair of brown
Seldom need to breathe
Don’t need no wings to fly
And a heart of stone
And a fear of fire and water
Who am I?Embed
