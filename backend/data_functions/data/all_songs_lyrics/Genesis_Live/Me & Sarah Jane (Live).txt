Me & Sarah Jane (Live) LyricsThe fires are burning, ooh in another land
But don't start counting, ooh don't start counting
Colder and colder, the ice is moving closer
And it gets me down
Going round and round and down the same old track
With a pack on my back
I'm going swiftly nowhere, heart in my ear
Beating like a drum
Where will you go?
Aw...
All by yourself
(Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah, hah)
And now I'm standing on the corner, I'm waiting in the rain
But then in sunlight without warnin', I invent a name
Me and Sarah Jane, we had a special thing goin'
Me and Sarah Jane
It was a time of love and laughter. It wouldn't come again
We had a round of joyful laughter. Ooh, then began the pain
Me and Sarah Jane, we had a special thing goin'
Me and Sarah Jane
(Sarah Jane)
I'm searching for the clue
Traces on the sand
First, I'm flying, going round, round, round
Then, I'm sliding, going down, down, down
It Doesn't matter - where I start, I always end up
Crawling through those same old crowded rooms
Me and Sarah Jane, we had it coming, all the pain
Walkin' down the streets, and finding nothing is the same
Oh, but now the city lights are dimmin' one by one
It costs too much money to keep them on
Oh..
Me and Sarah Jane, in silence walk along the shore
Tears of joy and mocking laughter, words lost in the wind
Oh, the tide was risin' but there we stayed
We had no fear of dying, we weren't afraid
No no, no no, no no!Embed
