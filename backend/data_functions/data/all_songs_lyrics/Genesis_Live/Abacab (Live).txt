Abacab (Live) LyricsLook up on the wall, there on the floor
Under the pillow, behind the door
There's a crack in the mirror
Somewhere there’s a hole in a window pane
Now, do you think I'm to blame?
Tell me, do you think I'm to blame?
(When we do it) You’re never there
(When you show it) Just stop and stare
(Abacab) He's in anywhere
(Abacab)
If you're wrappin' up the world
Cause you've taken someone else's girl
When they turn on the pillow
Even when they answer the telephone
Don't you think that by now?
Tell me, don't you think that by now?
(When we do it) You’re never there
(When you show it) Just stop and stare
(Abacab) He’s in anywhere
(Abacab) Doesn't really care
You want it? You got it, gotta go
You want it? You got it, now you know
It’s an illusion, it's a game
A reflection of someone else's name
When you wake in the morning
Wake and find you're covered in cellophane
Well, there’s a hole in there somewhere
Yeah, there's a hole in there somewhere
Baby, there's a hole in there somewhere
Now, there's a hole in there somewhere
(When we do it) You're never there
(When you show it) You stop and stare
(Abacab) He's in anywhere
