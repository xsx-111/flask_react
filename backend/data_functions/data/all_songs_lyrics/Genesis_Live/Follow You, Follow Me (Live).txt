Follow You, Follow Me (Live) LyricsStay with me
My love, I hope you'll always be
Right here by my side, if ever I need you
Oh my love
In your arms
I feel so safe and so secure
Every day is such a perfect day to spend
Alone with you
I will follow you, will you follow me?
All the days and nights, that we know we’ll be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me?
Just one single tear, in each passing year
With the dark
Oh, I see so very clearly now
But all my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
Aw, fading away
But I can say
The night is long, oh but you are here
Close at hand, oh, I'm better for the smile you give to me
And while I live I will
Follow you, will you follow me?
All the days and nights, that we know we'll be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me?
Just one single tear, in each passing year there will be

I will follow you, will you follow me?
All the days and nights, that we know we’ll be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me?
Just one single tear, in each passing year
I will follow you, will you follow me?
All of the days and nights, that we know we'll be
I will stay with you, will you please stay with me?
Just one single tear, in each passing year
I will follow you, will you follow me?
All of the days and nights, that we know we'll be
I will stay with you, will you please stay with me?
Just one single tear, in each passing year
I will...Embed
