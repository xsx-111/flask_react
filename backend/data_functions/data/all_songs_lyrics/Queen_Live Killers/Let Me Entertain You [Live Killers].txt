Let Me Entertain You  Lyrics
Hey, it's a sellout!
Hey!

Let me welcome you, ladies and gentlemen
I would like to say hello
Are you ready for some entertainment? Are you ready for a show?
Gonna rock you, gonna to roll you, get you dancing in the aisles
Jazz you, razzamatazz you with a little bit of style

C'mon, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

I've come here to sell you my body
I can show you some good merchandise
I'll pull you and I'll pill you, I'll Cruella DeVille you
And to thrill you, I'll use any device
Ah, ha ha ha ha...
We'll give you crazy performance
We'll give you grounds for divorce
We'll give you piece de resistance
And a tour de force, of course!
We found the right location
Got a lot of pretty lights
The sound and amplification, listen, hey!
If you need a fix, if you want a high, Stickells'll see to that
With Elektra and EMI, we'll show you where it's at


So c'mon, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you


Just take a look at the menu
We give you rock a la carte
We'll breakfast at Tiffany's
We'll sing to you in Japanese
We're only here to entertain you
If you wanna see some action, you get nothing but the best
The S and M attraction, we've got the pleasure chest
Chicago down to New Orleans, we get you on the line
If you dig the New York scene
We'll have a son-of-a-bitch-of-a-time

Come on, let me entertain
Let me entertain
Let me entertain you
Through the night


 Hey, where's my backstage pass?
 That was a bit of a riot, yeah?
 Good - great one, outrageous costume!
 Hey, that Brian May, he's outta sight, man!
 Not many, not many... no, it's true!
 Woah, what is up with that? Funny...
 I always wanted to be a groupie!
 Oh man, I could give less of a shit if you wanted... C'mon!
 Oh, oh!Embed
