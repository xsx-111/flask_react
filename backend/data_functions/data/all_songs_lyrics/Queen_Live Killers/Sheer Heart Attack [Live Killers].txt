Sheer Heart Attack  Lyrics
Well you're just 17 and all you want to do is disappear
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between your ears
The way that you touch don't feel nothing

Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
I feel so inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inarticulate

Gotta feeling, gotta feeling, gotta feeling, like I'm paralyzed
It ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no surprise
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes

Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?


Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
I feel so inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inarticulate

Just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?

Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiacEmbed
