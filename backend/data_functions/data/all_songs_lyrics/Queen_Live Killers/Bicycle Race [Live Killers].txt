Bicycle Race  Lyrics
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride it where I like

You say black, I say white
You say bark, I say bite
You say shark, I say, hey, man
Jaws was never my scene and I don't like Star Wars
You say Rolls, I say Royce
You say God, Give me a choice!
You say Lord, I say, Christ!
I don't believe in Peter Pan, Frankenstein or Superman
All I wanna do is

Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my


Bicycle races are coming your way
So forget all your duties, oh yeah
Fat bottomed girls, they'll be riding today
So look out for those beauties, oh yeah
On your marks! Get set! Go!
Bicycle race, bicycle race, bicycle race
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle, bicycle race (I want a bicycle race)

Hey!
You say coke, I say caine
You say John, I say Wayne
Hot dog, I say, Cool it man
I don't wanna be the President of America
You say smile, I say cheese
Cartier, I say please
Income tax, I say Jesus
I don't wanna be a candidate for Vietnam or Watergate
'Cause all I want to do is
Bicycle, (Yeah) bicycle, (Hey) bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, (Come on!) bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride it where I likeEmbed
