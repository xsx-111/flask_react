Love of My Life  Lyrics
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, and now desert me

Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)


Back, hurry back, please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, oohEmbed
