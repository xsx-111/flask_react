Thirty-Five Thousand Feet of Despair Lyrics
Another moth disintegrates
Hovering in the beam of a searchlight
That's looking for a trace of a plane
Whose pilot it's a shame has gone insane

You can see the silhouette
Across the moon
He hung himself mid-flight
In the bathroom

Why is it so high?
Why is it so much?Embed
