How Will We Know? (Futuristic Crashendos) LyricsHow will we know
If this rush of noise we're hearing
Is the world's biggest hammer
Coming down on our heads crushing our lives
And everything that we've said
Crushing the existence of any small effects we've had
Or is it just some super-sonic flux invented in the future
Blowing up so hard you can hear it before it happens
How will we know?Embed
