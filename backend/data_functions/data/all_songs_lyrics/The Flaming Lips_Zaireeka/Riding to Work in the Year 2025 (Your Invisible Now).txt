Riding to Work in the Year 2025 (Your Invisible Now) Lyrics
On some driven ship, the morning commuter ride
Everything is orange and bright
In reflection, you can see you're standing paralyzed
Your suspended disbelief has lied

Your invisible now, and I know that it's hard to get used to
'Cause you're the last secret agent reporting back
But you're reporting back to nothing
Your invisible now, and I know that it's hard to get used to
Your invisible now, and I know that it's hard to get used to

The panoramic scene, the landscape's grand design
The moment overtakes your life
In the silver morning sun the worst is magnified
It makes you see the use of ChristEmbed
