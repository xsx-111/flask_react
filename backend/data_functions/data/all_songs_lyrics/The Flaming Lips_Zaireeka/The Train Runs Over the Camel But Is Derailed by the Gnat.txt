The Train Runs Over the Camel But Is Derailed by the Gnat LyricsAs if to be some kind of test
Born out of the boredom of who's better than the rest
This time they wouldn't measure the pointless small details
The only thing that mattered was if the "you" prevailed
Maybe it's just some coincidence that natural selection always works the best
What if they didn't count the molecules that failed
And the only thing that mattered were the pieces that prevailedEmbed
