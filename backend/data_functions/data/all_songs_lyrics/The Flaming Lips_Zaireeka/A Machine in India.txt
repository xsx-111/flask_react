A Machine in India LyricsI'm going to India
Over and over again
I'm standing in a cylinder
Seeing all the bleedin' vaginas
I feel it now coming over me
So I strive to love the Messiah
I'm going to India
Over and over again
I'm rushing to the nearest station
Feet and hands collide with the driver
All that I think, all I thought and all I know
The Syrian missile guides itself into the vaginas
I'm going to India
Over and over againEmbed
