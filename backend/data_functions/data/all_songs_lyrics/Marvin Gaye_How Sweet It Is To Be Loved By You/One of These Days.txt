One of These Days Lyrics
Duh dah duh dah duh dah duh duh dah duh

One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
Gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
And on that day, when I up and leave you
You can beat your life that I won't be back no more
Sang-a-song like duh dah duh dah
Duh dah duh dah duh dah duh duh dah duh

I know that I'm just a fool for you
Nobody has to tell me the way I am
It's the way I feel that make a difference
You see I love you so much that I don't care how I am

Hey now, what am I supposed to do
When you find out your love was untrue
Hey now, just have to stay
'Cause I don't have enough left to walk away

One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
Gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
Until that day, when I get my self together
I'm gonna stay right here, baby come with meEmbed
