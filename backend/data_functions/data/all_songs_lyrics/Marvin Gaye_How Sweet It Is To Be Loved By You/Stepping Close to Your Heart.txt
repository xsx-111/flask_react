Stepping Close to Your Heart LyricsI wanna be closer
Closer to your heart
'Cause last night I dreamed
That we were drifting apart
Now I beg you
Darling please
Say you will
Set my mind at ease
I wanna be closer

Let me closer
Closer to your kiss
For without it, my darling
I couldn't exist
Oh, I beg you
Darling please
Say you will
Set my mind at ease
I wanna be closer

Oh wee, honey yeah
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer to your heart
Closer to your heart
I wanna be closer
Closer to your embrace
That's where I long to be forever
Any time or any place
I'm begging you
Darling please
Say you will
Set my mind at ease
Let me be closer
Closer to your heart
Closer to your heart
Just a little bit closer
Closer to your heart
I'm heading
Heading your direction
I'm looking for
Love and some affection
Let me closer baby
Just a little closer
Darling let me closerEmbed
