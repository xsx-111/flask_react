Need Somebody LyricsOh well, I'm the kind of guy that always needs
Somebody
Oh well, I'm the kind of guy that tries to keep me
Someone
Oh, somebody
Someone to walk with
To talk with
Tell all my troubles to
Somebody
Hey angel
Won't you tell me when you
When you get ready
I'll give you love
Love like you never had before
I'll give you everything I got
If you tell me that you'll be my

I'll give you everything I got
Oh, yeah
Have you ever had a feeling that you wanna hold
Somebody
Baby I got that feeling, I got to hold
Somebody
Someone to stand by me
Try me
I'll never let you downEmbed
