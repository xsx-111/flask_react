No Good Without You Lyrics
Girl, before you walk away
Here's one thing I've got to say
I'll be no good without you, baby
No good without you, baby

Well, I've got money, and I've got fame
But if you leave me, it don't mean a thing
That's why I'm begging, baby, please don't go
That's why I'm trying, love, to let you know
That's why I'm trying, baby, to make you see
Just how much, how much you mean to me

I'll be no good without you, baby
No good without you, baby

Your love, it made me ten feet tall
Your leaving leaves me nothing at all
What did I do, baby, to make you wanna go?
What did I say, baby, to hurt you so?
What's come between us? Can it be
Somebody has stole your love from me?
Oh, oh, oh baby
Baby, please, please don't leave me
If you leave me, baby, I'll be in misery
No good without you, baby
I'll be no good without you, baby

Well, take my money, and take my fame
'Cause if you leave me they don't mean a thing
Oh, I'll keep on begging, baby, please don't go
And I'll love you harder than I did before
'Cause I'll be crying when you close the door
'Cause I know, I know when you go

I'll be no good without you, baby
Baby, don't leave me
I'll be no good without you, baby
Oh, don't leave me, baby, baby
Oh, I'll be no good without you, baby1Embed
