Try It Baby Lyrics
Now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Oh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine
But take away your good looks
And all your fancy clothes

Why don't you just
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby
You'll see
Nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)
Nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)

Now you tell me that you're so busy, pretty baby
You ain't got much time
Oh, how well I remember
When all your time was mine, mine, mine
Well move on back 'cross the track, baby
Where you came from
Why don't you just
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby
You'll see
Nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)
Nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)

I really want to hold you, pretty baby
In my arms again
But I can't get close to you
For all your loving friends, friends, friends
But take your name from the bright lights, baby (Take it from the lights)
And tell me that you are all through (Tell 'em you are through)

Come on and
(Try it) Try it honey
(Try it) Oh, try it baby
(Try it) Try it sweetheart
(Try it) Try it baby
You'll see
That nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)
I just want you to
(Try it) Try it baby
(Try it) Try it baby
(Try it) Try it sweetheart
(Try it) Try it, honey
You'll see
That nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)

I want you to
(Try it) If you think I'm lying
(Try it) If you don't believe me
(Try it) Think I'm jivin'
(Try it) MmhmmEmbed
