Welcome to Earth (Pollywog) Lyrics
Hello, my son
Welcome to Earth
You may not be my last
But you'll always be my first
Wish I'd done this ten years ago
But how could I know
How could I know
That the answer was so easy?
I've been told you measure a man by how much he loves
When I hold you I treasure each moment I spend
On this Earth, under Heaven above
Grandfather always said God's a fisherman
And now I know the reason why

And if sometimes (Now, now)
Daddy has to go away (Daddy has to go away)
Well, please don't think (Please don't think)
That it means I don't love you
Oh, how I wish (How I wish)
I could be there every day (Be there every day, yeah)
'Cause when I'm gone
It makes me so sad and blue (Makes me sad and blue)
And holding you is the greatest love I've ever known
Oh, when I get home it breaks my heart
Seeing how much you've grown
All on your own
Oh
Oh
Hearing you cry
It made me cry
It made me cry
Hearing me cry
A thousand miles away
Every cry (Greatest love I've ever known)
(Ever known)Embed
