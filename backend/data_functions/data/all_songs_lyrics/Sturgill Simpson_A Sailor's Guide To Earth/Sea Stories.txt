Sea Stories Lyrics
Basic was just like papaw says
"Keep your mouth shut and you'll be fine"
Just another enlisted egg
In the bowl for Uncle Sam's beater
When you get to Dam Neck
Hear a voice in your head
Saying, "My life's no longer mine"
Have you running with some SAD SOG
BMF sandeaters

Setting out on them high seas
Feels just like being born
But that first port call in Thailand
Feels like a pollywog turning nineteen
They've got king cobras fighting in boxing rings
And all the angels play Connect Four
Well, it seems like a sailor's paradise
But it turns out to be a bad dream

Well, now you hit the ground running in Tokyo
From Kawasaki to Ebisu
Yokosuka, Yokohama and Shinjuku
Shibuya, Ropongi, and Harajuku
Aw, from Pusan and Pohang, Pattaya to Phuket
From Singapore to Kuala Lumpur
Seen damn near the whole damn world
From the inside of a bar
I've got sea stories
They're all true
Might seem a little bit far-fetched
But why would I lie to you?
Memories of ink forever stained
Still got salt running through my veins
I've got sea stories
And my shellback, too

Sometimes Sirens send a ship off course
Horizon gets so hazy
Maybe get high, play a little GoldenEye
On that old 64
And if you get sick and can't manage the kick
And get yourself kicked out the navy
You'll spend the next year trying to score
From a futon life raft on the floor
And the next fifteen trying to figure out
What the hell you did that for
But flying high beats dying for lies in a politician's war1Embed
