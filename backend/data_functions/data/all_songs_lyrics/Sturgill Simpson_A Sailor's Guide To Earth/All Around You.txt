All Around You Lyrics
There will be days
When the sun won't shine
When it seems like the whole world is against you
Don't be afraid
Life is unkind
You can let go of the pain if you choose to

'Cause time slips away
Skies fall apart
It ain't too hard
A universal heart
Glowing
Flowing
All around you

There will be nights that go on forever
Like you're long lost at sea never to be found
Just know in your heart
That we're always together
And long after I'm gone
I'll still be around
'Cause our bond is eternal
And so is love
God is inside you, all around you and up above
Growing
Showing
You the way
'Cause time slips away
Skies fall apart
It ain't too hard
A universal heart
Glowing
Flowing
All around you1Embed
