Breakers Roar Lyrics
Oh, how the breakers roar
Keep pulling me farther from shore
Thoughts turn to a love so kind
Just to keep me from losing my mind
So enticing, deep dark seas
It's so easy to drown in the dream

Oh, and everything is not what it seems
This life is but a dream
Shatter illusions that hold your spirit down
Open up your heart and you'll find love all around
Breathing and moving are healing and soothing
Away all the pain in life holding you down

Bone breaks and heals
Oh, but heartaches can kill
From the inside, so it seems
Oh, I'm telling you it's all a dream

It's all a dream
It's all a dream
It's all a dream
It's all a
It's all a dream2Embed
