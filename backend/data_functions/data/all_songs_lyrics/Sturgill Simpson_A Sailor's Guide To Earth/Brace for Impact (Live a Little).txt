Brace for Impact (Live a Little) Lyrics
One day you'll wake up
And this life will be over
Every party must break up
For burdens to shoulder
We're dying to live, living to die
No matter what you believe
And all of us cry
For the ones we must leave

So go and live a little, bone turns brittle
Skin withers before your eyes
Make sure you give a little
Before you go to the great unknown in the sky

Some beg for forgiveness
From someone above
For something they did
To someone they love
Some scream like a baby
Some go out crying
Some bid the world goodbye
And welcome dying
Go out and live a little, bone turns brittle
Skin withers before your eyes
Make sure you give a little
Before you go to the great unknown in the skyEmbed
