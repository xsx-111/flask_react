Phone Number Lyrics
Girl, you say you'll never ask for more
But watch out just what you are wishing for
There's a place, there's a place you've been dreaming of
But that place is in front of you, baby love

Can't you see what we're doing?
Can't you see what it does?

'Cause I don't know
I ever wanted you to let go
I never wanted you to lay low
I must be crazy now to let you
Let you, let you go
Ah, I never wanted you to let go
I never wanted you to lay low
I must be crazy now to let you
Let you, let you go

Oh, I remember how I came to you
You said I could go fuck myself and that's when I knew I wanted you too
You made me feel old and you know that's what I hate
But then you made me feel even older and, well in a way, that felt great
Can't you see what we're doing?
Can't you see what it does?

'Cause I don't know
I ever wanted you to let go
I never wanted you to lay low
I must be crazy now to let you
Let you, let you go
Oh, I never wanted you to let go
I never wanted you to lay low
I must be crazy now to let you
Let you, let you, let you go

You're asking me to remove your number from my phone
You're asking me to remove your number from my phone
You're asking me to remove your number from my phone
You're asking me to remove your number from my phone

I never wanted you to let go
I never wanted you to lay low
I never wanted you to let go
I never wanted you to let go
To remove your number from my phoneEmbed
