Changes Lyrics
I'm not the man for changes
What does it mean to you?
I tried to change the obvious
But somehow I just never do
You think that I'm unsettled
But actually I don't think that I am
Too many old bad habits
Still I wouldn't wanna change a thing

It goes on and on and on and on and on
Want to love you like I've never loved no one
I watch the time as it moves on and on
Somehow that can turn me on

I know that things could be better
Sometimes it feels we're cursed
But if I imagine those changes
Well, somehow they would make it worse
You say I'm always looking for something, baby
And it may be, yes, that I am
But does it mean that I would
Ever want to change a thing?
It goes on and on and on and on and on
Want to love you like I've never loved no one
I watch the time as it moves on and on
Somehow that can turn me on
Changes
Ooh oh, ooh oh
Ooh oh. ooh oh
Ooh oh oh

It goes on and on and on and on and on
Want to love you like I've never loved no one
I watch the time as it moves on and on
Somehow that can turn me on
Changes, just take me as I am

All these changes
Won't change us, honey
Maybe I just hope they won't
All these changes
Won't change us, honey
Maybe I just hope they won't
All these changes
Won't change us, honey
Maybe I just hope they won't
All these changes
Won't change us, honey
Maybe I just hope they won't
All these changes
Won't change us, honey
Maybe I just hope they won't
All these changes
Won't change us, honey
Maybe I just hope they won'tEmbed
