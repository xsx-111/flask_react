Grapefruit Lyrics
You talk about some grapefruit
Switch to the friend you met
You never end a sentence
I didn't start one yet
We gotta turn it
This situation

You don't like the expression
You're seeing on my face
I'm very sorry darling
I come in different ways
We gotta turn it
This situation
We gotta turn it
This situation

I'll, I'll, I'll get lonely
But it's worth a shot
I'll, I'll, I'll get lonely
But compared to what
You talk about your freedom
Like you know what freedom's for
I thought about your concept
Till I couldn't breathe no more
We gotta turn it
This situation
We gotta turn it
This situation

I'll, I'll, I'll get lonely
But it's worth a shot
I'll, I'll, I'll get lonely
But compared to what
I'll, I'll, I'll get lonely
But it's worth a shot
I'll, I'll, I'll get lonely
But compared to what
We gotta turn it (I'll, I'll, I'll get lonely)
This situation (But it's worth a shot)
We gotta turn it (I'll, I'll, I'll get lonely)
This situation (But it's worth a shot)
We gotta turn it (I'll, I'll, I'll get lonely)
This situation (But it's worth a shot)
We gotta turn it (I'll, I'll, I'll get lonely)
This situation (But it's worth a shot)
Turn it aroundEmbed
