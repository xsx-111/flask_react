Entertainment Lyrics
Baby if you want it
Then why don't I let you know?
And right when I thought I had a chance
It turned out I was too slow

Nothing but loss
Can I ever win?
When it’s just another one of those tricks
You use to turn me in

Yeah, it changes what I do
Maybe it changes what I am
And right when I'm sure I know what I think of you
It changes back again

Nothing but love
Nothing but sin
Entertainment's what I’m gonna need
To make you mine again

Baby if you got it
Let it be known
Don't deny it
Call it your own
Baby if you want it
Wear it with pride
Come on girl now
Damn, if you'd hide
Entertainment in your bed
And entertainment in your sleep
Entertainment's what the world needs
To keep turning around you see

It's the fix I need once more
Before I end up down the grave
It's the sugar that can bind us
And makes me stick to what you say

Baby if you got it
Let it be known
Don't deny it
Call it your own
Baby if you want it
Wear it with pride
Come on girl now
Damn, if you'd hide
Baby if you got it
Let it be known
Don’t deny it
Call it your own
Baby if you want it
Wear it with pride
Come on girl now
Damn, if you’d hideEmbed
