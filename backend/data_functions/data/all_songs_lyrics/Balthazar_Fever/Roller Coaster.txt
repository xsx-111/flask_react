Roller Coaster Lyrics
If there's a thin line
I used to walk it fine
But she got me off balance
My feet won't align
You roller coaster
I'm stuck in the wrong gear
To come closer
To get anywhere near

Don't send me on my way
If I make you think of someone
And if it's all the same
I won't quit before I've begun
Well, baby come on

As you sip from your cocktail
Quickly you steal a look
The moment you inhale
From the cigarette you took
The smoke, it cannot hide
The way you roll your eyes
And with the play of light
Gracefully clockwise
Don't send me on my way
If I make you think of someone
And if it's all the same
I won't quit before I've begun
Well, baby come onEmbed
