Wrong Vibration Lyrics
You want to turn it into something good
But cutting out the heart is what you do

Don't let your morality affect your imagination, girl
’Cause this ain't the time or place for it, my love

Girl, why don't you give yourself a break
And find out what’s your favorite mistake?

Yeah, don't your integrity affect your imagination, girl
'Cause this ain't the time or place for it, my dear
I get the wrong vibration
I get the wrong vibration

One day you'll make something out of me
According to the law of infinite probability
Huh, woo

Don't let your morality affect your imagination, girl
'Cause this ain't the time or place for it, my love
I get the wrong vibration
I get the wrong vibration
But I get the wrong vibration
Can’t you feel it? It’s tiring, girl
I get the wrong vibrationEmbed
