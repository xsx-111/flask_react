Fever Lyrics
If you get the fever down in your heart
I'm sure that fever is gonna be hitting you hard, uh
You say it makes you feel you're alive
You call your father the moment that fever arrives, uh

It comes easy to, comes easy to you
Just like I do, too
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

You say your money means nothing to you
But to be honest, your money was all that I knew
Great, another rich kid topping the charts
But then I heard it and it hit the soft spot in my heart

'Cause it comes easy to, comes easy to you
Just like I do, too, yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

(No more rushing)
(No more rushing)
I get the fever every time you cross my mind
(No more rushing)
(No more rushing)
I get the fever every time you cross my mind
(No more rushing)
(No more rushing)
I get the fever every time you cross my mind
(No more rushing)
(No more rushing)
I get the fever every time you cross my mind
(No more rushing)
(No more rushing)
I get the fever every time you cross my mind
I get the fever every time you cross my mind
I get the fever every time you cross my mind
I get the fever every time you cross my mind
I get the fever every time you cross my mind
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I get the fever every time you cross my mind4Embed
