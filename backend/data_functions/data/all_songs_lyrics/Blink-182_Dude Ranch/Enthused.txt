Enthused Lyrics
Am I strung out, crazy, or not allowed
To be the one who gets stupid over you
Lazy, laid back, maybe you're just on crack
Why am I the one who gets fucked up and confused

She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care about those times we never shared at all

If I were the last of the few who always ask
Would you still be the same person that I knew
And if it's for me, another boring story
I swear I'll act enthused4Embed
