Dick Lips Lyrics
Please mom, you ground me all the time
I know that I was right, all along
And I'm hoping, remember, I'm a kid
I know not what I did, just having fun

You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday, I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through

Nothing to lose, a boy who
Went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do, they can't trust me
Because I blew it once before

Shit dad, please don't kick my ass
I know I've seen you trashed at least one time
Can I blame it on one of my dumb friends?
It's been awhile since I have used that line

You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday, I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through
Nothing to lose, a boy who
Went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do, they can't trust me
Because I blew it once before, alright!


Nothing to lose, a boy who
Went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do, they can't trust me
Because I blew it once beforeEmbed
