Boring Lyrics
You don't need nothing
And I know that you won't even try
Don't wait for me to help you
It's too late for any of my advice

No trust
All I got is lies
Boring
Alright

Misplaced your values
Forgot the importance of being right
Don't sit there and act humble
I've heard your story a thousand times

No trust
All I got is lies
Boring
