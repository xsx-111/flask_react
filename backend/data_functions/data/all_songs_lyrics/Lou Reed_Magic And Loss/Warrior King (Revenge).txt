Warrior King (Revenge) Lyrics
I wish I was the warrior king
In every language that I speak
Lord over all that I survey
And all that I see I keep
Power omnipresent
Undiminished uncontrolled
With a message violent fury
At the center of my soul

I wish I was a warrior king
Inscrutable benign
With a faceless charging power
Always at my command
Footsteps so heavy that the world shakes
My rage instilling fear, ah, ha
Yet cautious firm but fair and good
The perfect warrior king

I wish I installed angels
In every subject's house
Agents of my goodness
No one would be without
A steak on every plate
A car for every house
And if you ever crossed me
I'd have your eyes put out
You don't exist without me
Without me you don't exist
And if logic won't convince you
Then there's always this
I'm bigger, smarter, stronger, tough
Yet sensitive and kind
And though I could crush you like a bug
It will never cross my mind

It wouldn't cross my mind to break your neck
Or rip out your vicious tongue
It wouldn't cross my mind to snap your leg like a twig
Or squash you like some slug
You are a violent messenger
And I'm not above your taunts
And if you hit me you know I'll kill you
Because I'm the warrior king2Embed
