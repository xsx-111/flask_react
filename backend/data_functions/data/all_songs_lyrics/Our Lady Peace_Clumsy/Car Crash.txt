Car Crash LyricsTired and jaded
This road is unsafe
Have you been there?
Have you been there?
But time is on your side
You're too stubborn to wait
Are you listening?
Are you listening?
They want you to know
They want you to stay
Oh it's too much to take
So you're running
Oh, you're running away
But Oh-oo
No-oo
It's more than I can bear
Oh
It's more than I can bear
Car crash
Ending your day
At the side of the road
Are you trembling?
Are you trembling?
They'll wake up today
To the papers that say
"Oh, well" it was too hard to tell
He was swerving
They were swerving
Much too late
Oh
It's more than I can bear
Oh
Oh, it's more
It's more
Oh, it's more
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
But oh
Hi-ee, I-ee, I-ee, I-ee
Ho
Hi
It's more than I can bear
Oh
It's more than I can bear
More
More
More
Ha ha
Ha ha
Ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha
Ha ha
Ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha
Ha ha
Ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
