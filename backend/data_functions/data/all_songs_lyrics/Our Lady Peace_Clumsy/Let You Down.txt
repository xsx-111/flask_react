Let You Down LyricsHey what do you see
It's not me, it's not me
Why won't you share
It's not fair, It's not fair
There's a bicycle show
Where the bicycles float
And I, I wouldn't've cared
I wouldn't've cared
I wouldn't've cared
And I won't be the one who bothers you
And I won't be the one who lets you down
Hey, bothers
Hey, bothers you
Hey, bothers
Hey
Now, now that you're there
You're not scared, not scared
But why, why would you care
It's your dream
Not theirs
There's a cigarette thief
Stealing cigarette disease
And I, I wish I was there
I wish I was there
I wish I was there
And I won't be the one who bothers you
And I won't be the one who lets you down
And I won't be the one who bothers you
And I won't be the one who lets you down
Hey, bothers
Hey, bothers you
Hey, bothers
Hey
Bothers you
Who bothers you
And I won't be the one who bothers you
And I won't be the one who lets you down
And I won't be the one who bothers you
And I won't be the one who lets you down
Bothers you
Bothers you
Bothers you
Bothers you
Bothers...youEmbed
