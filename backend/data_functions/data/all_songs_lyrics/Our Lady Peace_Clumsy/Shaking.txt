Shaking LyricsSo, you fucked this up again
It's time for you to leave
You never had many friends
And you thought this was alright
You're rushing to meditate
You should eat but probably wait
You never thought of yourself, of yourself
Why are you shaking
Why are you right
But I will be the only one who gives
And lets you in tonight
And lets you in tonight
Walk
You could never walk away
From this speedfreak collagen
Caffeinated place
You were always reaching in
Looking for somewhere to go
Nobody needs to find out
Nobody needs to know
What you know, what you know
Why are you shaking
Why are you right
But I will be the only one who gives
And lets you in tonight
And lets you in tonight
Do do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do
So, you wonder about the past
When you know that it's already been
Nothing seems to last
Can it last
Will it last
Why are you shaking
Why are you right
But I will be the only one who gives
And lets you in tonight
And lets you in tonight
Who lets you in
Who lets you in
Who lets you in
Who lets you....Embed
