Carnival LyricsYou know you're not a strong man
And you're just about to cry
Hang on .. Hang on
It's alright...It's alright
You worry about the future
The sign said "Yoga Class for Cats"
It's okay .. It's okay
It's no fun...
You're frustrated by the cracks
In the pavement
And every mother's back
Once again
The carnival closed down
But if this world would ever turn around
And the dynamite is waiting
Cause they bankrupted the sky
It's okay...It's okay
It's no fun...
You're frustrated by the cracks
In the pavement
And every mother's back
Once again
The carnival closed down
But if this world would ever turn around
Break your mother's back
If you step on the cracks
And everybody knows...
You're frustrated by the cracks
In the pavement
And every mother's back
Once again
The carnival closed down
But if this world would ever turn around
You'll be there when everybody's sane
You'll be there when everybody's sane
When everyone is sane, you'll be there
When everyone is sane, you'll be thereEmbed
