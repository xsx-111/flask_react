Hello Oskar LyricsOver there, well, he's wandering
Is Oskar there, is Oskar alright
Was never cool not allowed to fit
He never knew what he liked
And over there he's the rubberman
A rubber dress with Betty Page eyes
Was never cool, he'll never settle down
He's not allowed to drive
He'll build a bridge then walk around
Don't ever call him dumb
He's not that bright
He's not that bright
And he's not him, not him
And I will take you somewhere
Somewhere to unwind
You're tangled up in all this shit
And I will make you mine
And I will make you...mine
There's nothing wrong
He's a superstar
A taxi man and a young Einstein
Was never cool
He'll never settle down
He's not allowed to drive
He'll build a bridge then walk around
Leave that boy alone
He's not that bright
He's not uptight
He's just not him, not himself
And i will take you somewhere
Somewhere to unwind
You're tangled up in all this shit
But I will make you mine
And i will make you mine
And I can take you somewhere
Somewhere to unwind
You're tangled up in all this shit
And I will make you mine
I will make you mine
I will make you mine
Make you mine, mine, mine
Make you mine, mine, mine
Make you
But I can take you somewhere over
Mine, mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine, mineEmbed
