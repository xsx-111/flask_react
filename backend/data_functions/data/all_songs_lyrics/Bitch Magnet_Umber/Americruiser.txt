Americruiser LyricsMouth backed up with yellow teeth, sealed tight with receding gums
That's  pussy
Her shirt's pulled down way below her knees
Cop stands back disgusted, shining beam, still wincing after the smell
They take her away, but I catch the tail end
I catch the very tail end of that ugly grin
All of this fits in quite well with the life I've decided suits me
Not tough to shake up, not tough to beat
Red eye has broken my back in two
Red eye has broken my back in two
Sure could use a good place to sleepEmbed
