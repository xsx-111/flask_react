Motor LyricsMy motor
Feel it burn
My engine
You hear it sing
'Cause I'm the jack and I'm the king
I'm the jack and I'm the king
He's a little bent, and he's a little stink
There's something missing
Sits there on his lap, as he races 'round the track
Inching his pit of bliss
He's king gasoline, his hands stinking of Vaseline
'Cause I'm the jack and I'm the king!
'Cause I'm the jack and I'm the king!Embed
