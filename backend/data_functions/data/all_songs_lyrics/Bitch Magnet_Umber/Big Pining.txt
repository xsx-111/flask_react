Big Pining LyricsWhat do I have here
To grow before I get old
Dreaming a dream alone
But stopping if I get too bold
Six days with the tallest pines
Six days with the sun in your eyes
Six days with the 
Six days without speaking at all
Know where to go to
I've got nowhere to go to
Nowhere is my home
No, home is when I'm with you
Oh, home is when I'm with you
Oh, home is when I'm with you
Oh, home is when I'm with you
Oh, home is where I take youEmbed
