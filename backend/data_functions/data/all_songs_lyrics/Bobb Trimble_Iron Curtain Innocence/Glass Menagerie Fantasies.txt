Glass Menagerie Fantasies LyricsWell, you live in a world of glass menagerie fantasies
And you're praying to your unicorn gods to bring relief
And you're drinking from a fountain of belief
Oh, it's a wishing well of despair
Praying that impending danger will pass through your fragile world with care
Well you're drinking from a fountain of belief
Oh, it's a wishing well of despair
Praying that impending danger will pass through your fragile world with care
Woe, woe, ho... Woe, woe, ho...
Well, don't hold prisoner in your imaginary world of
Fantasies
And keep from breaking my heart with your delicate memories
For I've  shattered the hourglass of hope
Never to replace those grains of sand
For an iron clad alibied, damned world of lies, iron curtain
Innocent man
For I've  shattered the hourglass of hope
Never to replace those grains of sand
For an iron clad alibied, damned world of lies, iron curtain
Innocent man
Ooo...Ooo...Ooo...
You have the elegance and grace of a bird of paradise
And the beauty and serenity of a butterfly in flight
But, you're too damned fragile to touch or hold
Over the years you just keep growing old
Now that your story has been told
Why do you keep me out, why do you keep me outside in the cold
Woe, woe, ho... Woe, woe, ho
Well, you live in a world of glass menagerie fantasies
And you're praying to your unicorn gods to bring relief
And you're drinking from a fountain of belief
Oh, it's a wishing well of despair
Praying that impending danger will pass through your fragile world with care
Well, you're drinking from a fountain of belief
Oh, it's a wishing well of despair
Praying that impending danger will pass through your fragile world with care
Ooo...Ooo...Ooo, Ooo...Ooo...Ooo
Oh, no, no, there's no pity for youEmbed
