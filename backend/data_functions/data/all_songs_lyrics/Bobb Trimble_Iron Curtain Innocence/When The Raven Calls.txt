When The Raven Calls LyricsDon't forget the shadow upon the wall
Don't forget the shadow when the raven calls
Life support system, just burst into flames
Picture is fading and signal now weeping
I'm going to die
This is the end
Will the conference now really be all out of supplies?
World is now ending, the human race is dying
For it darkens the sky
This is the end
Save the world
Save the peace for me
Save the world
When the raven calls
That'll be world war III
Everything existing
Our life is defreezed
Children are playing
While the streets are all empty
And I'm burning by
I take my farewell again
When the buildings aren't crumbles
And there's slotting on the planes
My dreams turn to ashes
My ashes are sticking
I'm filtered away
And blown to the west
Safe the world
Safe the peace for me
Safe the world
When the raven calls
That'll be world war III
When the raven callsEmbed
