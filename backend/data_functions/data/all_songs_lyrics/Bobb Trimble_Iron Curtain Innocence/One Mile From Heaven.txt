One Mile From Heaven LyricsOne more step and you walk out the door
Never to return to me
All i want is for you to be mine
Living now ain't what it ought to be
I'm really sorry if I caused you pain
And I'll never do it again
But you're one mile from heaven now
One mile to be free
One mile from heaven now
And i hope you forgive me
Give me courage to see your success
While I'm failing at every dream
All I want is for things to be right
Living now ain't what it ought to seem
I'm really sorry if I caused you pain
And I'll never do it again
But you're one mile from heaven now
One mile to be free
One mile from heaven now
And I hope you forgive me
I'm really sorry if I caused you pain
And I'll never do it again
But you're one mile from heaven now
One mile to be free
One mile from heaven now
And I hope you forgive me
(fading)
One more step and you walk out the door
Never to return to me
All I want is for you to be mineEmbed
