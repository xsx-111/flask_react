Through My Eyes (Hopeless as Hell: D.O.A.) LyricsMy eyes cannot see you, my world is a blur
Memories of the past render me helpless
(help me, help me, help me)
Wait until the morning comes to show you who's king
Memories of that night render me speechless
(speak for me, speak for me, speak for me)
Will I ever get to the end of the rainbow yet
Without you by my side?
Will I ever get to the end of the rainbow yet
Without you by my side?
By my side?
By my side?
By my side?
By my side?
My heart cannot feel you, my mind is a maze
Memories of the times render me hopeless
(hope for me, hope for me, hope for me)
Wait until the morning comes to show you who's king
Memories of that night render me lonesome
(hold me, hold me, hold me)
Will I ever get to the end of the rainbow yet
Without you by my side?
Will I ever get to the end of the rainbow yet
Without you by my side?
By my side?
By my side?
By my side?
By my side?
My arms cannot hold you, you're so far away
Will I ever get to see tomorrowEmbed
