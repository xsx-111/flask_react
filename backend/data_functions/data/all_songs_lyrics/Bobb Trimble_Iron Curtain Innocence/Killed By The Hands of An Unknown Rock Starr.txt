Killed By The Hands of An Unknown Rock Starr LyricsOK, Prudence, you've won your case
Put the smile back on your face
Used to be real to me long ago
Now I know that it isn't so
So take the smile from the face that you once had
Although I know you're all right, try to see me now for that's all right
Although I know you retracted from your life and all of your sins
Try to start a new life, and you'll see that it will begin again
Keep me wandering, keep me searching for the times that have gone by
Killed by the hands of an unknown rock starr - yes, you were
Killed by the hands of an unknown rock starr - yes, you were
Killed by the one playing on this guitar
So please, won't you remember me?
And the times that used to be?
Running faces and running wild
Won't you hold me for a little while?
Although I know you retracted, you're going to cause more lies
Pick up your masquerade face and then put on your disguise
Keep me wandering, keep me searching for the times that have gone by
Killed by the hands of an unknown rock starr - yes, you were
Killed by the hands of an unknown rock starr - yes, you were
Killed by the one on this guitar
So please, won't you remember me?
And the times that used to be?
Running faces and running wild
Won't you hold back the clock for a while?
Killed by the hands of an unknown rock starr - yes, you were
Killed by the hands of an unknown rock starr - yes, you were
Killed by the one on this guitar
Killed by the one on this guitar
Killed by the one on this guitarEmbed
