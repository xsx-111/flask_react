Halfway Home LyricsYou said we're halfway home
You said survive
You said we're halfway home
You said survive
Come right
Into the sunlight
'cause I see their cold eyes
I fear they still burn
Like it was so what
As if it's so much
All through my fallen face
End to end
You said we're halfway home
You said survive
This is my horror time
This is my fallen fate
'cause if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive
'cause if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive
You said we're halfway home
You said survive
You said we're halfway home
You said survive
Dreams change and I know that I'm gonna die
But I don't need what I know now
You were beautiful my love
I see what I wanna hear
(Come right) If you don't believe in headlights
You won't get caught in the mighty
(Into the sunlight)
It's the same no matter what we have here
('cause I see the cold eyes)
It's crossfire it's the blazing fears
It's fall end to end
(And I fear they still grow)
And you'll forget
Call out for a change
But not believe in anything
You will forget
Call out for a change
And not believe in anything, anything
You will forget
Call out for a change
Not believe in anything, anything
You will forget
Call out for a change
And not believe in anything
Oh no
Oh no
Cause if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive
Cause if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you aliveEmbed
