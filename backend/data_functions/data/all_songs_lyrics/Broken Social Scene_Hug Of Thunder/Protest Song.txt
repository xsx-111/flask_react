Protest Song Lyrics
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
(Days go dark, the night's a drone)
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
(Days don't end for nights alone)
(Days don't end for nights alone)

Just take it, just take it like you're strong
You're just the latest in the long list of lost loves, loves
Just leave it, we are left where we are from
We're just the latest in the longest rank and file list
Ever to exist in the history of the protest song

How can I tell you're here the way you are?
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
(Days go dark, the night's a drone)
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
(Days don't end for nights alone)
(Days go dark, the night's a drone)
(Days go dark, the night's a drone)
Just take it, we are left where we are from
You're just the latest in the long list of lost loves, love
We're just the latest in the longest rank and file list
Ever to exist in the history of the protest song

Well, it is
Whatever it is
And you are
Wherever you are

How can I tell you're here the way you are?
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
(Days go dark, the night's a drone)
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
(Days don't end for nights alone)
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
(Days go dark, the night's a drone)
How can I tell you're here the way you are?
(Days don't end for nights alone)
(Days don't end for nights alone)
(Days go dark, the night's a drone)
(Days go dark, the night's a drone)
We're just the latest on the longest rank and file list
Ever to exist in the history
Longest rank and file list
Ever to exist in the history
Longest rank and file list
Ever to exist in the history of the protest song1Embed
