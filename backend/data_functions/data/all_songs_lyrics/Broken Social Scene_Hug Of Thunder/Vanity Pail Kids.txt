Vanity Pail Kids LyricsDo you remember your house
Like a super high five
Do you remember your mouth
And all the mythical lies
You wanna be the size of your love
You wanna be the size of your god
You wanna be the size of this trust
You must make sure that you steal it
You wanna be the size of your sex
You wanna be the size of your mess
You wanna be the size of what's next
You must make sure that you steal it
(Oh yeah baby, oh)
(I just feel so good)
You wanna be the size of your love
You wanna be the size of your god
You wanna be the size of this trust
You must make sure that you steal it
You wanna be the size of your sex
You wanna be the size of your mess
You wanna be the size of what's next
You must make sure that you steal it
All the time we wait for more
You don't have it all
Do you remember your house
And all the superman kids
Do you remember your mouth
Before they ruined all this
You wanna be the size of your love
You wanna be the size of your god
You wanna be the size of this trust
You must make sure that you steal it
You wanna be the size of your sex
You wanna be the size of your mess
You wanna be the size of what's next
You must make sure that you steal it
All the time we wait for more
You must make sure that you steal it
You don't have it all
You must make sure that you steal it1Embed
