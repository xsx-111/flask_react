Stay Happy LyricsI came away unscathed
You came alive in your own state
I was naked and staring
At the face that I could not see
How could you be and I be
You set me straight at love
With your fists up and your bracelet
You're the belle and you beckon
The hours the minutes the seconds
The more you are will I be
Will I be me
There may be dogs at the door
But you are a lottery winner
And maybe it's my hard head
That keeps me dreaming
Rise and shine with dirt in your eyes
Sun in your head and never forget
That it's alright
Ok
Alright alright alright alright
Original wonder you gave it back to me
Original wonder originally
All the lies and loves that are competing
All the loves and lies that are competing
Original wonder you gave it back to me
Original wonder originally
You set me straight at love
With your fists up and your bracelet
You're the belle and you beckon
The hours the minutes the seconds
The more you are I will be
I will be me
I will be me
The hours the minutes the seconds
I will be me
The hours the minutes the seconds
I will be me
The hours the minutes the seconds
I will be me
The hours the minutes the seconds
I will be me
The hours the minutes the seconds
I will be meEmbed
