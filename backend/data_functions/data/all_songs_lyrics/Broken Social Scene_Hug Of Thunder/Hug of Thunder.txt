Hug of Thunder LyricsMany years before I kept track of the years I felt I would look back Otherwise why did I write down everything that entered my mind?
Check out these lines, like -
"I'm Syd Barrett and I'll swim to England in his clothes, in 20 holes"
How could I say at what point I would gain perspective let alone know I had it?
Survival by the soundtrack made of our short lives
Making sense of hologram ecology
I'll be up crying listening to Grace
And hiding in the pages adding up to me
Eternity
'til I leave
It's like a topography that is made from cartography of me,
All those feelings
Every day the bus stop was the size of the entire world
The ball that broke your tooth
And carving at me all the time was I had done you wrong
I hope I'm sorry
Certain times in our lives come to take up more space than others
And time's gonna take it's time
The Kennys said I broke in over the summer
It was the evening when he climbed that tree
I was afraid what he was doing inside so I followed him to stop a robbery
All along we're gonna feel some numbness
Oxymoron of our lives
Getting fed up by that hunger
Supersize we found inside
They will know it's real, our numbness
Catching up and climbing life
Speaking like a hug of thunder
Lit up by the lights at dusk outside
All along we're gonna feel some numbness
Oxymoron of our lives
Getting fed up by that hunger
Supersize we found inside
They will know us by our numbers
Catching up and climbing life
Speaking like a hug of thunder
Lit up by the lights at dusk outside
There was a military base across the street
We watch them training while we leaned
There was a military base across the street
We watch them training while we leaned
We watch them training while we leaned2Embed
