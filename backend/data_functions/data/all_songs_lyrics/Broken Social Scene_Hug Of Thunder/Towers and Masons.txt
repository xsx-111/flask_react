Towers and Masons LyricsThey came to wed, and show
We came in late, touch score
Walking along
Avenue
Walking along
Struck in two, and found
Falling, falling
Back to towers and masons
I can't wait 'til the world
To know when
Falling, falling
Back to towers and masons
I can't wait to know
You'll notice
It's a mess
They crawled out
Of shells
They crawled out of
Their shells
They crawled out
Of shells
They crawled out of
Their shellsEmbed
