Victim Lover LyricsLook at the moon look after you
Look at all the things you didn't do
It's easy to believe disaster tries
Look at the stars look at the cars
Look at the things you pretend are yours
While we choke the sleep that you disguise
I'm still trying
Trying
Trying to deceive that this is right
Yeah I'm crushing
Crushing
Crushing on the prisoner by design
Look at the clues look at the bruise
Look at all the things that you did lose
I don't think this girl could crack a smile
Eat up the hearts, release the charts
Do what you think is why you're who you are
Estimate the dark of gone tonight
Oh, the winter minds, dream of the sea to arrive alive
My war is not better, my better is the best that you will find
Look at the men look at your friend
Look at the one you want to never end
Hostage like to feed the metre dimes
Look at the door look at your floor
Look at the face you want some more
Beaten down by the lonely pride
It's not me, it's not you, not them, not this time
It's not me, it's not you, not them, not this time
Oh, the winter minds, love to dream to arrive alive
Oh, the winter minds, dream of the sea to arrive aliveEmbed
