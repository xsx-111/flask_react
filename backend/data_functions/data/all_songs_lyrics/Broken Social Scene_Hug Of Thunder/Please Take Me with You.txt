Please Take Me with You LyricsPlease take me with you
I'm so tired
All the fools are winning
And nobody's wild
It's all about the fingers
Not about the eye
Please take me with you
I need your kind
And we'll run away for life
Yeah we'll run away for life
(S M C Y T I see the light above ya)
(S M C Y T I see the light above ya)
Please take me with you
It's getting dark
And nobody's speaking
Everyone's getting caught
All the men are leaving
There's nothing to start
Please take me with you
I want your heart
And we'll run away for life
(S M C Y T I see the light above ya)
Yeah we'll run away for life
(S M C Y T I see the light above ya)
Please take me with you
Yeah, I'm so tired
(S M C Y T I see the light above ya)
And nobody's speaking
And nobody's wild
(S M C Y T I see the light above ya)
It's all about the fingers
It's not about the eyes
(S M C Y T I see the light above ya)
Please take me with you
I need your kindEmbed
