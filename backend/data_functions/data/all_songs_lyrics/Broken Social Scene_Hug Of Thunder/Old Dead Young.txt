Old Dead Young LyricsYou can live on the past
With a beach and a mouth that fills you up
This is what I know
They can see all the signs and the needs
And the guards that wanna come and fuck you up
God is what they show
I'm ready to die so I feel you out
No no no no no I'm filled with doubt
Don't want to be a shadow of the sun
I'm old
I'm dead
I'm young
You continue the size of the fee's
And the worlds that wanna come and fuck you up
I don't wanna go
Every night they repeat with a line that says
You should come out and give me up
God I think I know
I could be inside you every night
Smashed to pieces man I should really cry
Where do we go to find those simple times
I'm old
I'm dead
I'm fine
Oh, in the kindest hours
I feel my heart
You can live on a past
With a beach and a mouth that will fill you up
This is what I know
All the timed out leeches coming down
And trying to slowly fuck you up
Baby let's just go
I'm ready to die so I'll take you out
No no no no no I'm filled with doubt
Don't want to be a shadow of the sun
I'm old
I'm dead
I'm youngEmbed
