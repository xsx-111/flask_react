Gonna Get Better LyricsFuture's not what it used to be
We still got to go there
Future's not what it used to be
You are all whispers, all whispers
Just a whisper
If you can
Got to go there
Future's not what it used to be
But we still gotta
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse, oh
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse
No they can't get worse
Things are gonna get better
I don't want to speak for you
I don't want to speak for you
I can't hear you
Tell me what you got to say
I can't hear you
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse, oh
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse
No they can't get worse
Things are gonna get better
Things are gonna get worse
Things will get better
Well I can't be the most of you
The temperature, once arose
I don't know what you like
It's gotta be
A photograph
You cannot believe a mouth
Who knows what they wanted
You cannot believe
Who knows what they want
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse, oh
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse
No they can't get worse
Things are gonna get better
Your head in my heart
Your head in my heart
Head in my heart
Head in my heart
Head, heart
Head, heartEmbed
