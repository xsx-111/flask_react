Skyline LyricsThe skyline waits for the world
The skyline waits for the fall
But you shouldn't have come at all
The skyline waits for the world
The skyline waits for the fall
But you shouldn't have come at all
'Cause I know
You're never gonna be
No you're never gonna be that word
You shouldn't have come at all
Yeah I know
You're never gonna be
No you're never gonna be that word
I shouldn't have come at all
The skyline waits for the world
The skyline waits for the fall
But you shouldn't have come at all
The skyline waits for the world
The skyline waits for the fall
But you shouldn't have come at all
'Cause I know
You're never gonna be
No you're never gonna be that word
I shouldn't have come at all
Yeah I know
You're never gonna be
Yeah you're never gonna be that word
I shouldn't have come at all
The skyline waits for the world
The skyline waits for the fall
But you shouldn't have come at all
The skyline waits for the world
The skyline waits for the fall
But you shouldn't have come at all
'Cause I know
You're never gonna be
No you're never gonna be that word
I shouldn't have come at all
Yeah I know
You're never gonna be
No you're never gonna be that word
I shouldn't have come at all
I shouldn't have come at all
I shouldn't have come at allEmbed
