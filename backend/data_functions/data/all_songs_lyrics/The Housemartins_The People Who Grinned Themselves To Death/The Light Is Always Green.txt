The Light Is Always Green Lyrics
We dig our models with the brains the size of marbles
And cars that we can trust with our wives
And we dig conversation with girls from every nation
But not the ones that whisper or tell lies

Wherever there's a will, there's a motorway
Wherever there is greed, there is speed
And they've always got to be there for yesterday
Welcome to the new Scalextrics breed

And the light they always show to them
Is green, green, green
And the heels they always show to me
Are clean, clean, clean
And the light they always show to them
Is green, green, green
Green, green...

We're only flying past, so we dig our service fast
From the waiters to the women to the wine
Never mind the match, I've an urgent date to catch
Get me to the concert hall on time
Pretending to be pilots in a war
Pretending to weave between the flak
No one knows what the mission's for
Blinkered horses on the track
