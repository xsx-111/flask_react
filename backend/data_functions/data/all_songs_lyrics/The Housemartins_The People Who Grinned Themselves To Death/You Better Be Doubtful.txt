You Better Be Doubtful Lyrics
Tinker, you better place another bet
The rich up in the castle haven't finished eating yet
They'll throw you a bone or a spat-out stone
But knowing them, that's all you'll get
Tailor, you better close another shop
No-one wants your quality, make do with what you've got
They'll let you survive, they'll let you get by
But knowing them, they'll let you rot

(You better be doubtful) you better be doubtful
(You better beware, ware, ware) you better beware
(You better not shout now) you better not shout, now
(You better not care, care, care) you better not care

Tinker, you better buy another boot
Those 'Poker Continental' are finally showing through
We'll get you a pair from a second-hand fair
They'll only have a 'two'
Sailor, you better sink a few more ships
Admiral loony Nelson cannot find his game of Risk
We'll lose a few lives, a couple of tribes
But knowing him, he'll lick his lips

From Queen Wilkinds to Queen Victoria
We've had a promising side
From King Callaghan to Bonny Prince Francis
We've paid up and we've cried
Princess Gower and Princess Ferguson
We've looked a hard nut to crack
But we're weak at the
But we're weak at the
But we're weak at the back!
