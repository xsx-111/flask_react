Bow Down LyricsMother, father, I think that I would rather
Stay at home with you for another year
That building's so tall and it makes me feel so small
That I might get lost and simply disappear
Evil smiles won't change my mind
I'm worried and I'm not the worrying kind
Why's that man rubbing his hands
Looking at me, writing down his plans?
Today I have been moulding Plasticine
And I made a little man who looked just like me
His limbs were so weak and he couldn't move his mouth to speak
And I could bend him into any shape I wanted him to be
Evil smiles won't change my mind
I'm worried and I'm not the worrying kind
Why's that man rubbing his hands
Looking at me, writing down his plans?
Those kids with the blazers on
They went in with names on their elbows
Came home with medals on
Spit it out, that's the way the story goes
A flying start for the briefcase crew...
Oh, you didn't have to teach me
Like you did, but you did
And you didn't have to beat me
Like you did, but you did
But you did, but you did
But you did, but you did
You did, you did
You did, you did...Embed
