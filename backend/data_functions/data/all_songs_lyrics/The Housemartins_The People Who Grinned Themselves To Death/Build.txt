Build Lyrics
Clambering men in big bad boots
Dug up my den, dug up my roots
Treated us like plasticine town
They built us up and knocked us down

From Meccano to Legoland
Here they come with a brick in their hand
Men with heads filled up with sand
It's build...

It's build, a house where we can stay (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
Add a new bit every day, eh, eh, eh (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
It's build, a road for us to cross (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
Build us lots and lots and lots and lots and lots (Ba-ba-ba-ba)

Whistling men in yellow vans
They came and drew us diagrams
Showed us how it all worked  out
And wrote it down in case of doubt

Slow, slow and quick, quick, quick
It's wall-to-wall and brick-to-brick
They work so fast, it makes you sick
It's build...
It's build, a house where we can stay (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
Add a new bit every day, eh, eh, eh (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
It's build, a road for us to cross (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
Build us lots and lots and lots and lots and lots (Ba-ba-ba-ba)

Oh, it's build...
It's build...
It's build...

Down with sticks and up with bricks
In with boots and up with roots
It's in with suits and new recruits
It's build...

It's build, a house where we can stay (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
Add a new bit every day, eh, eh, eh (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
It's build, a road for us to cross (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
Build us lots and lots and lots and lots and lots (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
It's build, a house where we can stay (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
Add a new bit every day, eh, eh, eh (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
It's build, a road for us to cross (Ba-ba-ba-ba-build)
Build us lots and lots and lots and lots and lots (Ba-ba-ba-ba)Embed
