Five Get Over Excited Lyrics
Fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun

James Dean posters on their wall (five killed in a car crash)
What a sad little end to it all (five killed in a car crash)
Last seen having lots of fun (five dumped in a river)
Barefoot and on the run (five dumped in a river)

I am mad from Scandinavia
I want a guy in the London area
He must be crazy and Sagittarius
'Cause I am Leo and I'm hilarious
Which gives me...

Fun, fun, fun (Jeremy)
Fun, fun, fun (Fifi)
Fun, fun, fun (Jeremy)
Fun, fun, fun
Last seen drinking daddy's own beer (five poisoned over dinner)
Singing Abba's Mamma Mia (five poisoned over dinner)
Drop dead watching Thunderbirds fly (five get over excited)
Poster on their wall says "Why?" (five get over excited)

I am Guy from Camden Town
My hair is curly but I gel it down
My clothes are black but my bread is brown
I'm really into early Motown
Which gives me...

Fun, fun, fun (Jeremy)
Fun, fun, fun (Fifi)
Fun, fun, fun (Jeremy)
Fun, fun, fun

Feigning concern, a conservative pastime
Makes you feel doubtful right from the start
The expression she pulls is exactly like last time
You've got to conclude she just hasn't a heart
Fun, fun, fun (Jeremy)
Fun, fun, fun (Fifi)
Fun, fun, fun (Jeremy)
Fun, fun, funEmbed
