The Busy Girl Buys Beauty LyricsThe busy girl buys beauty
The pretty girl buys style
And the simple girl buys
What she's told to buy
And sees her world
Through the brightly lit eyes
Of the glossy romance of fashion
Where she can learn...
Top tips for the gas cook
Successful secrets of a sexual kind
The daily drill for beautiful hair
And the truth about pain
What was Anna Ford wearing?
What did Angela Rippon say?
What will you do
When you wake up one morning
To find that God's made you plain
In a beautiful person's world?
And all those quick recipes
Have let you down
And you're 20Â½ and not yet engaged
Will you go look for the boy who says
I love you let's get married and have kids
The busy girl buys beauty
The pretty girl buys style
And the simple girl buys
What she's told to buy
Through the brightly lit eyes
Of the glossy romance of fashion
Where she can learn...
Top tips for the gas cook
Successful secrets of a sexual kind
The daily drill for beautiful hair
In a mail order paradise...Embed
