So Much for the Afterglow LyricsThis is a song about Susan
This is a song about the girl next door
This is a song about the everyday occurrences that make me feel like letting go
Yes I think we've got a problem
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
This is a song about Susan
Yeah, this is a song about the way things are
This is a song about the scary things you see from the corner of your eyes
Don't you wonder why
We never talk about the future?
Yeah, we never talk about the past anymore
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to know
I guess our honeymoon is over
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
Oooh, I remember we could talk about anything
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember we could talk about anything
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember we could talk about anything
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember we could talk about anything
I remember, I remember!
Yeah, We never talk about the future
Oooh, We never talk about the past anymore
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to know
Oh well oh well oh well
So much for the afterglow
Oh well oh well oh well
So much for the afterglow
Oh well oh well oh well
So much for the afterglow
Oh well oh well oh well
So much for the afterglow
Yes I guess we need the drama
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglowEmbed
