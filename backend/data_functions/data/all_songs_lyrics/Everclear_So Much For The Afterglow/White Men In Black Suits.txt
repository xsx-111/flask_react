White Men In Black Suits Lyrics(One, two, three, four)
I am just a boy working in a record store
Yes I moved to San Francisco just to see what I could be
I am a loser geek, crazy with an evil streak
Yes, I do believe there is a violent thing inside of me
She is just a girl, she is doing what she can
She dances topless when she's not playing in her band
Such a pretty girl, happy in an ugly place
Watching all the pretty people doing lots of ugly things
I think it's getting better for the two of us
Yes, I think it's getting better almost everyday
I could give a damn for what those people say
All I wanna do is lose myself in your room
All you want is just a slow fuck in the afternoon
I still see those scary guys when I am all alone at night
I kiss the ring you gave me, then I swing with all my might
I think it's getting better for the two of us
I think it's getting easier for you and me to agree
That the white men in the black suits, they are diminishing
Yes, I think they are diminishing
Yes, I think that they diminish you
And they diminish me
I think they are diminishing
You known sometimes I hear those people say
Yeah, she takes the bus over to the north side of the city
She goes to work stripping for the rich white men
All the words they give her make her feel so soft and pretty
She wears them but they never ever seem to fit
Yes, I think it's getting better for the two of us
Yes, I think it's getting better in the worst way
I refuse to be afraid of almost anyone
Afraid of all the things they do, all the words that they say
Let's live the way we want to live and hope they go away
Ooh, I really hope they go away
Ooh, I really hope they find a nice place
I hope they find it somewhere
I hope they go away
I can still hear all those people say
I can still hear all those people say
I can hear those people say
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can still hear all those people say
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can still hear all those people sayEmbed
