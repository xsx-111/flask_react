Normal Like You Lyrics(One, two, three, four)
Yeah, they said you called me maybe yesterday
I don't even have the strength to pick up the phone
You wouldn't even know me since you went away
The Prozac doesn't do it for me anymore
Yeah, you ought to take your medication everyday
Be a good dog, live life in a wonderful way
Tell me why you want to be blind
I don't wanna be normal like you
I know now everyday
I get closer to the place inside
Where I can be normal too
I heard those stupid people talk about you again
I just have to laugh to keep from hurting bad
Their simple minds just cannot seem to understand
You are neurotic and depressed it doesn't mean that you're sad
You walk around oblivious to everything
Wear that party dress and black mascara
Like you're queen for the day
Tell me why you want to be blind
I don't wanna be normal like you
I know now everyday
I get closer to the place inside
Where I can be normal too
I will never be normal like you
You walk around oblivious to everyone
I see you walking slow and simple underneath the big black sun
Tell me why you want to be blind
I don't wanna be normal like you
I know now everyday
I get closer to the place inside
Where I can be complacent
Yes, I get closer to the place inside
Where I can be sedated
Yes, I get closer to the place inside
Where I can be normal too
(I can be normal too)
I can be normal like you
Maybe normal like you
I can be normal like youEmbed
