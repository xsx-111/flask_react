I Will Buy You a New Life Lyrics
Mmmm....oh
Yeah

Here is the money that I owe you
Yeah, so you can pay the bills
I will give you more when I get paid again
I hate those people who love to tell you
Money is the root of all that kills
They have never been poor
They have never had the joy of a welfare Christmas

Yeah
I know we will never look back
Yeah

You say you wake up crying
Yes, and you don't know why
You get up and you go lay down inside my baby's room
Yeah, I guess I'm doing okay
I moved in with the strangest guy
Can you believe he actually thinks that I am really alive
I will buy you a garden where your flowers can bloom
I will buy you a new car, perfect, shiny, and new
I will buy you that big house way up in the West Hills
I will buy you a new life
Yes I will

I know all about that other guy
The handsome man with athletic thighs
I know about all the times before
With that obsessive little rich boy
They might think you're happy
Yeah, maybe for a minute or two
They can't make you laugh
No, they can't make you feel the way that I do

I will buy you a garden where your flowers can bloom
I will buy you a new car, perfect, shiny, and new
I will buy you that big house way up in the West Hills
I will buy you a new life
Yeah
I will buy you a new life

Yeah
I know we can never look back
Yeah
No
Will you please let me stay the night
(No one will ever know)
Will you please let me stay the night
(No one will ever know)
No one will ever know
 X 2
I will buy you a garden where your flowers can bloom
I will buy you a new car, perfect, shiny, and new
I will buy you that big house way up in the west hills
I will buy you a new life
I will buy you a new life 2Embed
