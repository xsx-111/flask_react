Like A California King LyricsI see you have made yourself a brand new life
Ooh, such a cool blue star with a bright new shine
I see you wear your checkered past
Just like a shining suit of gold
I know you think you look so special
I am told you have found yourself a brand new time
Watch the world stand still as the years go by
I know you think you are new and different
But it makes no sense to me
There is nothing new about you
Just another self-made man
There is nothing new that I can see
Enjoy it while you can
I know you think you look so special
What makes you think you are so special?
What makes you think you are unique?
I see you smile and I get angry
As I watch you go colossal like a California king
All these Californians coming up here and changing everything
They're just a bunch of carpetbaggers and I wished they'd all just go. (Go!)
I hear you gave the world a brand new voice
Such a happy melody with a new wave whine
Yeah, I see you hide behind your own noise
I think I've seen enough
I will find you in the crowded room
I will knock you off your feet
I will burn you just like teenage love
I will eat you just like meat
I will break you into pieces
Hold you up for all the world to see
Yeah, what makes you think you are better than me?
What makes you think you're better?
What makes you think you are complete?
What makes you think you are the only one immune to falling down?
Why can't you see?
I see you fall and I get happy
I will watch you burn like fire
I will watch you burn like a California king
(I will watch you burn like a California king)
A California king
I will watch you burn like a California king
I will watch you burn like a California king
Mmm, I will watch you burn
Yes, I will watch you burn
Like a California
California king
Yeah, I will watch you burn like a California kingEmbed
