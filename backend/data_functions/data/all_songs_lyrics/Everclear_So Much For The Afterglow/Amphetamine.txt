Amphetamine LyricsShe came out west to find the sun
She lost her name, but found a new one
Amy goes to school all day
But at night in the neighborhood they call her Amphetamine
She's perfect in that fucked up way
That all the magazines seem to want to glorify these days
She looks like a teenage anthem
She looks like she used to be happy with the girl inside
Yea, she looks so bored sometimes
Yea, She has that super pale skin and those soft green eyes
She looks like she could have been happy
In a better life
She came out west just to break away clean
From her family and her friends and a little girl's dreams
All she wants to do every night is to sit beside my window
And listen to the sirens
She's perfect in that fucked up way
That all the magazines seem to want to glorify these days
She looks like a teenage anthem
And she looks like she could have been happy in a another life
Ooo, in another life
Ooo, in another life
Yea, in another life
Oh!
She came out west just to break the spell
After three long years in a marriage from hell
Six months clean, living sober and right
The doctors tell her everything will be alright
Yeah, you just take your pill
And everything will be alright
Yeah, you just take your pill
And everything will be alright
She looks like a teenage anthem
She looks like a magazine girl
She looks like a teenage anthem
Like she used to be happy in another world
She looks like a teenage anthem
She is happy with the girl inside
She looks like a teenage anthem
Looks like she could have been happy in another life
Ooo, in another life
Happy in another life
Ooo, in another life
Happy in another life
Ooo, in another life
Happy in another life
Ooo, in another life
Happy in another life
Met her at a party and I took her home
She is the saddest girl that I have ever known
Yea, she wakes me up in the middle of the night
Just to tell me everything will be alright
Amy smiles at me, tells me everything will be alright
Yea, Amy smiles at me, tells me everything will be alright
Yea, I tell myself the same damn thing every day
Ooo, everything will be alright
Ooo, everything will be alright
Ooo, everything will be alright
OooEmbed
