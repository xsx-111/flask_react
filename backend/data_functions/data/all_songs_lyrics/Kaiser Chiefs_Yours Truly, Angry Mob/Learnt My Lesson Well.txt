Learnt My Lesson Well LyricsI'm just waiting for
The man to come with all my things
And i'm just waiting for
Another man to take it all
And it's not hard to tell
That I learnt my lesson well
And I'm just waiting for
The man to come and go away
What are you waiting for
Get up off your seat
It's just seven days
Feels like a week
What are you moaning for
You got all that you want
Your life could be worse
You could be a nurse
It seems most sensible
For us to keep the purse strings tight
And move the decimals
A couple of places to the right
And it's not hard to tell
That I learnt my lesson well
It seems most sensible
But not exactly what we'd like
What are you waiting for
Get up off your seat
It's just seven days
Feels like a week
What are you moaning for
You got all that you want
Your life could be worse
You know, we all could be cursed
I can't help feeling like this
So don't rearrange it
I don't mean to be a dick
I just don't like the changes
And I can't help the things I say
You know I wouldn't to strangers
But I don't like going away
Because it puts me in danger
I can tell you now
There ain't a problem can't be solved
With a good old fashioned row
So grit your teeth and stand your ground
And it's not hard to tell
That I learnt my lesson well
But I'm still waiting for
The man to come with all my things
What are you waiting for
Get up off your seat
It's just seven days
Feels like a week
What are you moaning for
You got all that you want
Your life could be worse
You could leave in a hearseEmbed
