Boxing Champ LyricsWe went to the youth club
And we looked out of place
I didn't know where to look
So I looked at your face
But you were a boxing champ
And I was a weakling
You didn't give me a chance
You gave me a beating
And I thank you very much that you did
And as the time went by we
Stayed out of trouble
Before I could realize
My age had doubled
The man I became is a tragic bore
And he's not a boxing champ any more
If there's one thing I learned it's to run away
At least I enjoy what I do today
And I thank you very much that I do1Embed
