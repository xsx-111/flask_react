Thank You Very Much LyricsDidn't expect any of this
But it's really nice
Didn't want you to cause a fuss
But it feels alright
So Thank you very much
Its really nice to know
That you enjoyed the show
And I want you to know when to go
Cos this should be a thrill
But it feels like a drill
Now you must let me go, let me go
I just imagine that I'm you
And there's nothing nothing nothing I can't do
I just imagine that I'm you
And there's nothing nothing nothing I can't do
I just imagine that I'm you
And there's nothing nothing nothing I can't do
I just imagine that I'm you
And there's nothing nothing nothing I can't do
I remember what it was like
And it was really nice
Never thought I would experience this
From the other side
So Thank you very much
It's really nice to know
That you enjoyed the show
And I want you to know when to go
Cos this should be a thrill
But it feels like a drill
Now you must let me go, let me go
I just imagine that I'm you
And there's nothing nothing nothing I can't do
I just imagine that I'm you
And there's nothing nothing nothing I can't do
I just imagine that I'm you
And there's nothing nothing nothing I can't do
I just imagine that I'm you
And there's nothing nothing nothing I can't doEmbed
