Heat Dies Down LyricsI can just imagine you and me
Running out of steam
Going through the motions
And I have no idea how you know
When I dip my toes
In other people's oceans
'Cos you had a local knowledge of the local area
And that impressed me quite
So I tried that night
To do all the things I thought you'd like
But that just made it worse
And I impressed you not
Well not a lot
So we started from the start
When the heat dies down I'll be back in town
And until that time I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down I'll be back in town
And until that time I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
I cannot imagine growing old
To have and to hold
Till death do part each other
'Cos I doubt I could stomach twenty years
Spending time at hers
Talking to that mother
'Cos I got a wider knowledge of the world I just can't face
Another argument
About the rent
It all seems unimportant in the grander scheme of things
Cause I was purpose built
To not feel guilt
So we ended at the end
When the heat dies down I'll be back in town
And until that time I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down I'll be back in town
And until that time I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies downEmbed
