Everything Is Average Nowadays LyricsSooooooooooooooooooooooo
Everything is average nowadays
Everything is average nowadays
Everyone would do it if they can
And everything is going down the pan
And everyone is following the craze
And everything is average
Now you say it's getting better
But I don't really see the signs
Said it is too different
You thought it would be suicide
Not much to believe in
Left up on a shelf
So get your coats we're leaving
We'll just do something else
Ohhhh Everything is average nowadays
Everything is average nowadays
And everything is of no consequence
Cos everyone is sitting on the fence
And everything will always stay the same
Cos everything is average
Now you said you didn't mean it
You threw away the book of rules
You thought that we should read it
I wouldn't even know how to
Not much to believe in
Left up on the shelf
So get your coats we're leaving
We'll just do something else
All I need is a ball and a wall
Or a sledge and a hill in heavy weather
All I need is a ball and a wall
A sledge and a hill in heavy weather
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooooooooh
Not much to believe in
Left up on the shelf
So get your coats we're leaving
We'll just do something else
Oooooooooooooooooooooooh
Everything is average nowadays
Everything is average nowadays
Everyone would do it if they can
And everything is going down the pan
And everyone is following the craze
And everything is average nowadaysEmbed
