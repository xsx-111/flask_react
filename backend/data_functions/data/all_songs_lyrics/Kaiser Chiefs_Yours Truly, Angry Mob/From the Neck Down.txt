From the Neck Down LyricsYou're beautiful
In every way
From the neck down
From the neck down
The kind of face
That could sink ships
Not in a good
But in a bad way
You love her but you don't wanna show her to your friends
You love her but you don't wanna show her to your friends
You love her but you don't wanna show her to your friends
I've got a fast car
A convertible
We keep the top up
Lets keep the top up
You love her but you don't wanna show her to your friends
You love her but you don't wanna show her to your friendsEmbed
