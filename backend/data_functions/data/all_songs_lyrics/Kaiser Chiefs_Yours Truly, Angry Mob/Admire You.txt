Admire You LyricsYou said that stranger things have happened
I don't know why you're laughing
I wish I'd never asked
There must be something in the waters
Thats making it much stronger
Its building up to life
Do you admire me like I admire you?
Do you admire me like I admire you?
Lying low, it might be cause your easy
Or just because you're near to me
Or maybe cause you're new
There must be a combination of everything
Because I haven't seen a lot of things
As interesting as you
Do you admire me like I admire you?
Do you admire me like I admire you?
And I thought you were a nervous wreck
And it turned out that you were
I heard you were a bag of nerves
And it turned out that you were
Turned out that you were
Turned out that you were
I thought when you sad you needed me
You meant that you needed me
You just need me in the head
Do you admire me like I admire you?
Do you admire me like I admire you?
And I thought you were a nervous wreck
And it turned out that you were
I heard you were a bag of nerves
And it turned out that you were
Turned out that you were
Turned out that you were
Do you admire me like I admire you?
Do you admire me like I admire you?
And I thought you were a nervous wreck
And it turned out that you were
I heard you were a bag of nerves
And it turned out that you were
Turned out that you were
Turned out that you wereEmbed
