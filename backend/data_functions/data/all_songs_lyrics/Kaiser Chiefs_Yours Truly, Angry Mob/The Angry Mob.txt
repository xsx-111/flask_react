The Angry Mob Lyrics
I can prove anything, I'll make you admit again and again
That I can prove anything the way that it's writ again and again

And it's only cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
It's only cause you follow what the others do
It's no excuse to say you're easily led

You could choose anything and you choose to lose again and again
And you could do anything but why should you do anything again

And it's only cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
You're winding yourself up until you're turning blue
Repeating everything that you read

So here we go with a letter, can you fix it for me?
Because we need entertainment to keep us all off the streets
So tonight you'll sleep softly in your beds

You could try anything and no one would know apart from you and me
You could stop anything, it starts with just one and turns to two then three
And it's only cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
You'll raise a glass until you raise a fist or two
And get a shopping basket wrapped round your head

So here we go with a letter, can you fix it for me?
For twenty-four hours drinking to keep us all off the streets
So tonight you'll sleep softly in your beds

We are the angry mob
We read the papers every day
We like who we like
We hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
We are the angry mob
We read the papers every day
We like who we like
We hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
We are the angry mob
We read the papers every day
We like who we like
We hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
We are the angry mob
We read the papers every day
We like who we like
We hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
We are the angry mob
We read the papers every day
We like who we like
We hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
We are the angry mob
We read the papers every day
We like who we like
We hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
We are the angry mob
We read the papers every day
We like who we like
We hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
We are the angry mob
We read the papers every day
We like who we like
We hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
We are the angry mobEmbed
