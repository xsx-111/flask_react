Highroyds LyricsI remember nights out when we were young
They weren't very good they were rubbish
Running round Highroyds isn't fun
Just teenagers testing their courage
Standing outside nightclubs in the snow
Us not very cool or impressive
They let in all the girls from the year below
No need for ID's with those dresses
Got news from afar
From a girl who knows who we are
She's still got my dinner money
She can keep it
Never had a fight that we haven't lost
Not very tough or athletic
Once I had a boxing champ in a headlock
When he gets out I'll regret it
Got keys to a car
Picked up a girl from Boston Spa
For fast food and cinema
It's not worth it
Got word from down south
Well he had heard about it word of mouth
Haven't much stayed in touch
Since Highroyds
Let it go and let it go
And if I'm wrong then I won't know
Cos no one's gonna tell me but a friend
He has gone and Ian's gone
And everybody went along
And nobody was left here in the end
Got news from Uncle Hugh
Through a second cousin once removed
Too late there's a housing estate
It's called Highroyds
Got a text from an ex
She wants to know when we're in London next
"And will you write a song about me?"
I don't think soEmbed
