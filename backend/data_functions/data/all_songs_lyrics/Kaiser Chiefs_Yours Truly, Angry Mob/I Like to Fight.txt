I Like to Fight LyricsI like to fight
Throughout the night
I get a kick from it
And speaking of kicking
I might chuck a brick in
The window of your flat
I'm just doing what I've always done
I might look hard but I'm just having fun
I'm just doing what I've always done
Cause I'm just looking out for number one
Cause I don't need anyone
To get things done
I do it on my own
I get a kiss
She tastes of sick
And doesn't look that nice
And talking of sicking
Just getting some chicken
They tried to close it twice
I'm just doing what I've always done
I might look hard but I'm just having fun
I'm just doing what I've always done
Cause I'm just looking out for number one
Cause I don't need anyone
To get things done
I do it on my own
I don't love anything
So kick it in
I do it on my own
I get it I just don't think it's funny
I get it I just don't think you're funny
I just don't think it's funny
I like to get
Quite upset
With everyone around
I'm wearing a jacket
Where did I get it
I found it on the ground
I'm just doing what I've always done
I might look hard but I'm just having fun
I'm just doing what I've always done
Cause I'm just looking out for number one
Cause I don't need anyone
To get things done
I do it on my own
I don't love anything
So pack it in
I do it on my own
I don't need anyone
To get things done
I do it on my ownEmbed
