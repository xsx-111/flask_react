I Can Do It Without You LyricsNone of the buildings even look the same
And underneath them all the shops have changed
I don't pretend they're in a lot more pain
Stocking much too young for the professionals to stay in
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it without you
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it without you
I'm returning to the north again
Everybody has to talk on the train
And if you've got nothing thats clever to say
Nobody's listening to you anyway
'Cos I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it without you
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it without you
But it wouldn't be very good
La la la, la la la la la la la la la, etc
What you want here?
It doesn't matter!
I don't think that it can be done without you
What you doing?
It doesn't matter!
But everything that's done is all about you
We convince each other nothing has changed
Nobody else will ever write the same
The adaptation for the stage is not playing
For your protection all the names have been changed
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it without you
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it without you
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it without you
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it without you
But it wouldn't be very goodEmbed
