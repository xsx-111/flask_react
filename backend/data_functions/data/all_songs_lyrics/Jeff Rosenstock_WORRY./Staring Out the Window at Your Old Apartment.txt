Staring Out the Window at Your Old Apartment LyricsSomeone hung a decorative surfboard
Up where your records and movies belong
This light makes it nearly impossible
To see if they fixed all the cracks in the wall
Staring out the window at your old apartment
Imagining the old you stumbling through tacky renovations
That the landlord wanted to cash in on the boom
And you don't know where to go now
You've got nowhere to go now
I wish you'd come down and meet me here
I'm gridlocked
I'm not going anywhere
I've had a bad year
Staring out the window at your old apartment
Imagining the old you stumbling through tacky renovations
That the landlord wanted to cash in on the boom
And you don't know where to go now
You've got nowhere to go now
You don't know where to go now
You've got nowhere to go now
You don't know where to go now
You've got nowhere to go now
The city don't care if you live or die
It's just gonna grow and it doesn't care why
You're tired of kicking and fighting through life
And left me alone on this cold winter night
Just staring out the window at your old apartment
Imagining the old you stumbling through tacky renovations
That the landlord wanted to cash in on the boom
And you don't know where to go now
You've got nowhere to go now
You've got nowhere to go now
You don't know where to go now3Embed
