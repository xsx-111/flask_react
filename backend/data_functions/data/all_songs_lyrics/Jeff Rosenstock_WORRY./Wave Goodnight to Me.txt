Wave Goodnight to Me Lyrics
I used to walk down to the docks in spring
And drink Tallboys on the rocks by the water
Under the watchful eye of Day-Glo cranes
That spread like floods from corner to corner

Wave goodnight to me

When it all fell down
I should've been prepared
They've spent the last five years
Yelling "Come on."
"Come on, come on get out of here."
I wish it didn't hurt
I wish I didn't care
They've spent the last five years
Yelling "Come on."
"Come on, come on get out of here."

Yeah, ignorance is bliss until the day
The things you ignored all come into focus
And those conveniences leave cavities
That can't get filled 'cause you didn't notice
Wave goodnight to me

When it all fell down
I should've been prepared
They've spent the last five years
Yelling "Come on."
"Come on, come on get out of here."
I wish it didn't hurt
I wish I didn't care
They've spent the last five years
Yelling "Come on."
"Come on, come on get out of here."
"Come on, come on get out of here."
"Come on, come on get out of here."
"Come on, come on get out of here."

Wave goodnight to the sleepless city too tired to fight
They're pushing you out in the name of progress
Selling your memories to the tourists

Wave goodnight to me
When it all fell down
I should've been prepared
They've spent the last five years
Yelling "Come on."
"Come on, come on get out of here."
I wish it didn't hurt
I wish I didn't care
They've spent the last five years
Yelling "Come on."
"Come on, come on get out of here."
"Come on, come on get out of here."
"Come on, come on get out of here."
"Come on, come on get out of here."
Yeah, Wave goodnight to me2Embed
