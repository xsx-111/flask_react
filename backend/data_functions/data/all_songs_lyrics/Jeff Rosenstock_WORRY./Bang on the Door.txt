Bang on the Door LyricsI wanna say I'm just paranoid, but I'm not
There was a bang on the door
There was a bang on the door
I wanna say I'm just paranoid, but I'm not
There was a bang on the door
There was a bang on the door
And we can keep pretending this isn't really happening
Or wait until the noise goes away
We can declare our grand ambitions about living somewhere different
But we aren't doing anything today
We can avoid the telephone when it's a number we don't know
But we don't even know what they're gonna say
I wanna say I'm just paranoid, but I'm not
There was a bang on the door
There was a bang on the door
I wanna say I'm just paranoid, but I'm not
There was a bang on the door
There was a bang on the door
I'm tired of the downstairs neighbors judging me
When I come home late and drunk
I'm tired of them judging me from across the street
For the time that I wake up
I'm tired of the constant fear of building something here
When I know for sure they'll leave us high and dry
Without thinking twice when we can't pay more
There was a bang on the door
There was a bang on the door
There was a bang on the door
There was a bang on the door
There was a bang on the door1Embed
