Blast Damage Days LyricsWhenever days slip away and every moment with me
Feels like I'm floating in space because I want to believe
These are my halcyon days but I'm afraid of my age
And don't know anyone's name because I can't concentrate
Oh, I am never letting go of you
Whenever weeks slip away from being caught
In the wake of the American craze -- the overtime, underpaid
These are the Amazon days, we are the binge-watching age
And we'll be stuck in a screen until our phones fall asleep
I am never letting go of you
We'll get lost and wander off, distracted by fake news
When our towns fall to the ground
It won't shatter me and you and when we're looking around
At all the shit that went down
'cause half of us were too scared
And half of us were too proud to see
The systems we start are destined to fall apart
When we let power and greed corrupt our collective heart
Oh, I am never letting go of you
We'll get lost and wander off, enraptured by fake doom
When our towns fall to the ground
Oh, it won't shatter me and you
Whenever we feel ashamed being alive and awake
In such an era of hate and military police
These are the mass murder days
We are the blast damage age
Where we can't love anything because they keep us afraid
Oh, I will be there kicking, fighting, beating, screaming
"There's no fucking way I'm ever letting go of you!"1Embed
