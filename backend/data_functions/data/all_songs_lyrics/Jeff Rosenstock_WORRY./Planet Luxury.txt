Planet Luxury LyricsThe ones in power built a dream on guarantees of luxury
And sold it like it's magic to the poor
They trick you into thinking all it takes
Is just a little bit of effort once your foot is in the door
They brutalize your confidence and drain you of your energy
Until you're always tired and unsure
They make a lot of promises but keep on taking everything
So you always want more
You want more?
You want moreEmbed
