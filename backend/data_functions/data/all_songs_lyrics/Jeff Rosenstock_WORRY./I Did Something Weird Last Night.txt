I Did Something Weird Last Night LyricsI arrived, drenched in morning light
And it churned my guts unless I closed my eyes
Made it up the stairs to the bed Inside
Without puking up a fantastic time
And everything so unexpectedly started to feel like a dream
But I couldn't stop drifiting out when the magic would spin
2:00 PM: I missed my class again
Did you miss yours too because you're sleeping in?
Are the two of us both imagining
Seven-hour round trips into each others' beds?
Everything so unexpectedly started to change in the dream
But I was preoccupied with how the magic would end
Because nothing intangible remains sustainable
Hope is a scheme
Will I ever see you again?
And if I see you soon
Will you want to see me?
Or will you just want to sneak away?
Did I creep you out like a scary movie?
I hope that we feel the same
I hope that we feel the same
Fuck!
Oh, I did something weird last night
I made out in the van with a girl I like
We were kinda drunk
But it seemed alright
So we made out for the entire ride
And everything so unexpectedly started to feel like a dream
But I was preoccupied with how the magic would end
Because nothing intangible remains sustainable
Hope is a scheme
Will I ever see you again?
Will I ever see you again?
If I see you soon
Will you want to see me
Or will you just want to sneak away?
Will you kiss me hard like a garbage movie?
I hope that we feel the same
I hope that we feel the same
I hope that I'm not reading into this too much
It's a kiss
I hope that I'm not reading into this too much
It's a kiss
But is there someone thinking of me when I'm feeling alone
And I'm spending weekends staring at the wall
If there's someone thinking of you when you're feeling alone
How can that compare to nothing nice at all?
And if I see you soon
Will you want to see me
Or will you just wanna sneak away?
Will you kiss me hard like some shit in a terrible movie?
I hope that we feel the same
I hope that we feel the same
I hope that we feel the same
I hope that we feel the same
Fuck!
Oh, I did something weird last night
I made out in the van with a girl I like
We were kinda drunk
But it felt alright
So we made out for the entire ride1Embed
