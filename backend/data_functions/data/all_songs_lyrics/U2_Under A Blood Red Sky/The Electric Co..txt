The Electric Co. Lyrics
Boy, stupid boy
Don't sit at the table
Until you're able to
Toy, broken toy
Shout, shout, you're inside out

If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
Red, running red
Play for real
Talk and feel
A hole in your head
You won't shout
You're spoon fed

If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
Two, three, four
I can't stop
Useless is the castle wall
Useless is the metal wall
He's gonna jump

If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co

Till someone leaves him below
He's searched high and low
A tap on the wrist and he'd know
Somebody hear him
Just leave him
I can't find my way home
I'm alone
I've lost my way home
You know and you know
And you know and you know
And you knowEmbed
