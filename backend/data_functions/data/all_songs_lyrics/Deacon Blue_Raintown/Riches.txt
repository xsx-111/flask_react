Riches LyricsIt's good to know how big a life can be
Especially when it falls away so easily
And how hard it is to let you take your leave
Also I wish you all the things
That you believe in
Like riches
Now that they're different
And work
With your burden lifted like riches
Now that they're different
And work
With your burden lifted
I wish all those things if you would leave
Bright clothes for winter
Bright clothes for winter
When you go on your journey
Don't say goodbye
Don't need clothes to wear
Or money to buy
Don't take a bed to sleep in or sleeves to cry on
And don't go gently into that good night
And take riches
Now that they're different
And work
With your burden lifted take riches
Now that they're different
And work
With your burden lifted
I wish all those things if you would leave
Bright clothes for winter
Bright clothes for winter
You found a great big kingdom
And you gave it all away
And how I want live there
And how I hope you'll stay
And take riches
Now that they're different
And work
With your burden lifted take riches
Now that they're different
And work
With your burden lifted
I wish all those things if you would leave
Bright clothes for winter
Bright clothes for winter
Bright clothes for winterEmbed
