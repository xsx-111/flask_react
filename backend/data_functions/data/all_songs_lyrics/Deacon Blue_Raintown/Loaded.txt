Loaded LyricsYou sigh, you walk, you talk, you care about nothing
Sometimes you feel that life has treated you wrong
I've got a feeling you know what the score is baby
But it's hard when you're sitting here surrounded by friends
I've got a love that i'll cling on to
And i'll stay there stay there till the end
'cause one thing i know is
I have found an answer i don't think you don't care
Just you laugh 'cause you're loaded
And things are different from there
I have found an answer i don't think you don't care
Just you laugh 'cause you're loaded
And things are different from there
You walk and you talk
And you sing and you shout
And you justify about anything
And you rant and you rave and you hope and you say nothing
And you eat and you drink and you dress and you live as if
No one else did baby
No one else like you lives out in this world
I've got a love that i'll cling on to
And i'll stay there stay there till the end
'cause one thing i know is
I have found an answer i don't think you don't care
Just you laugh 'cause you're loaded
And things are different from there
I have found an answer i don't think you don't care
Just you laugh 'cause you're loaded
I have found an answer i don't think you don't care
Just you laugh 'cause you're loaded
And things are different from there
I have found an answer i don't think you don't care
Just you laugh 'cause you're loaded
And things are different from thereEmbed
