Born in a Storm LyricsThat hurricane day
Will soon pass away
And someone will sweep
All the jetsam back into the bay
And you'll come
Like you always did
And knock on my door
Like the big bad wind
Born in a storm
Is that the only excuse you can give
Born in a storm
Is that all you're going to liveEmbed
