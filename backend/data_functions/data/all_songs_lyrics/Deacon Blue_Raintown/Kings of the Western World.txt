Kings of the Western World LyricsI have an old friend
So the story goes
He never calls without saying hello
He's got a good job
So the story goes
He says it's it's funny to see you look so low
I said I'm on top of the hill
Looking down at the Kings of the Western World
I went out and caught the train home
Looked at the land so the story goes
They've got factories and jobs and playground provided
And the workers are willing so the story goes
But
I'm on top of the hill
Looking down at the Kings of the Western
World
The Western World
And people get born
So the story goes
And people get schooled
So the story goes
And people get on
So the story goes
And people get ruled
So the story goes
And people they die
So the story goes
And left on the hill
So the story goes
But
I'm on top of the hill
Looking down at the Kings of the Western
World
The Western World
I'm looking at the Kings
I'm looking at the world
I'm looking at the Kings
I'm looking at the
Kings
I'm looking at the
World
I'm looking at the
Kings
I'm looking at the
World
I'm looking at the
Kings
I'm looking at the
WorldEmbed
