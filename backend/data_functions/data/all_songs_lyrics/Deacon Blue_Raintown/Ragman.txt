Ragman LyricsOffered her a roof
The rain had made it shine
Offered her a song
Wasn't really mine
I showed her all my things
She offered me belongings
She thought i was a ragman
She offered me possessions
I tied them in a knot
Wrapped it in a note
Kept it in my pocket
I showed her all my things
She offered me belongings
She thought i was a ragman
I came to her too soon
She should have had a ragdoll
And wound up with a ragman
Wing and kites and wedding rings
All these charms i said i'd bring
I showed her all my things
She offered me belongings
She thought i was a ragman
Baby you're a rich man
Lost in a small world
Looking for a ragdoll
Wound up with a ragman
With a ragman
