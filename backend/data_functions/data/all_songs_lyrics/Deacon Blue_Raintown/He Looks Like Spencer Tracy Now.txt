He Looks Like Spencer Tracy Now LyricsThere's a shadow on his photograph on Tinian '45
Smiling like a college boy who's glad to be alive
But now he owns a factory and a store in Los Alamos
A wife called Beverly sells second-hand Ford Motors
He may have taken pictures, been caught in Albuquerque
Flown in "Great Artiste" on a mushroom cloud
Now he may be a senator or a general or a turn key
But he looks like Spencer Tracy now
And he cries all night
And he cries all night
And he cries all night
And he cries all night
And he may have been with Oppenheimer, shaking Einstein's hand
Said "did we have to drop the bomb?" You bet, to save this land
He was only taking pictures around the critical mass
While the troops on Tinian Island sang 'Follow the bouncing ball'
White Christmas
He may have been a nationalist, a physicist or a pacifist
But he's just taking pictures and he'll do it anyhow
Well, I have seen that movie of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
And I know he looks like Spencer Tracy now
And he cries all night
And he cries all night
And he cries all night
And he cries all night
Tears falling down the streets
And he cries all night
And he cries all night
And he cries all night
And he cries all night
Oh, he cries all nightEmbed
