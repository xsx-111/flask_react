Chocolate Girl LyricsAlan doesn't understand her
He only thinks in numbers
He only drinks in restaurants
Where the girls are fully covered
And he can't trust his yearnings
And he doesn't like pretending
His tempers stretched so much by work
His heart needs gentle rending
He calls her the chocolate girl
Cause he thinks she melts when he touches her
She knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silver
Alan doesn't understand this
He says he's only human
So he still lights up with old flames
As if to try and prove it
And he doesn't like emotion
He's not certain of their ardour
If pouting causes so much fun
Then breaking hearts is harder
He calls her the chocolate girl
Cause he thinks she melts when he touches her
She knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silver
Alan doesn't understand her
He thinks its getting harder
So he spends the night with old friends
Underneath the covers
And he talks about the chocolate girl
And how he thinks she melts when he touches her
And that she knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silver
He calls her the chocolate girl
Cause he thinks she melts when he touches her
She knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silverEmbed
