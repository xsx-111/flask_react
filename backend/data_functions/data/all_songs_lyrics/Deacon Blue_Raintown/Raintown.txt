Raintown LyricsIt's a rain-dirt-town-job hurts, but it don't pay
All these calls they're making me and driving you insane
Don't you see don't you understand
Waiting for the phone to ring to make me all i am
You're in the suburbs waiting for somewhere to go
I'm down here working on some dumb show
In a raintown raintown rain down
On all those tired eyes and tears and frowns
In a raintown raintown rain down
On all those days you're not around
It takes a big hearted girl from the north country you can tell
How you payed those bills and went through heaven and hell
And you you cried and you travelled and you spat but you never asked
Well how long how long how long is this pain
You're on for three minutes trying hard to say "hello"
I'm down here working on some dumb show
In a raintown raintown rain down
On all those tired eyes and tears and frowns
In a raintown raintown rain down
On all those days you're not around
Sitting at home listening to your radio
Listening for your old friend talking on some dumb show
In a raintown raintown rain down
On all those tired eyes and tears and frowns
In a raintown raintown rain down
On all those days you're not aroundEmbed
