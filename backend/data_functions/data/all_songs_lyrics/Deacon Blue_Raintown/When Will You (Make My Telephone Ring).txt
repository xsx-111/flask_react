When Will You (Make My Telephone Ring) LyricsPale blue eyes
Same old house no ties
A little bit older but not so
Worldly wise
That i can't see
Your light's on me
Making me regretfully say
The wonder of it all was you
And underneath it all it wasn't true
I want you in everything
In everything
In anything i do
When will you make my phone ring
And tell me i can't give you anything
Anything at all now
Tiny steps
From ruthless legs
When you've been walking so long
Now don't you rest
From disharmony
From disunity
From anything that isn't you and me
The wonder of it all was you
And underneath it all it wasn't true
I want you in everything
In everything
In anything i do
When will you make my phone ring
And tell me i can't give you anything
Anything at all now
Tired of chasing old dreams
Tired of wasting days
Tired of waking mornings
Just to wait for you till late
Tired of searching high
Tired of getting low
Tired of listening hard
Just to wait for you to know that
I want you in everything
In everything
In anything i do
When will you make my phone ring
And tell me i can't give you anything
Anything at all nowEmbed
