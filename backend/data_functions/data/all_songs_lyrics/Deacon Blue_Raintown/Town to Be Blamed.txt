Town to Be Blamed LyricsClose your eyes and go to sleep
From the howling howling over these streets
People stare 'cause you're so mad
That wild wild spark that innocent laugh
But baby that's this town
It won't happen next time
Yeah baby that's this town
Lovers on love downs
It's this town to be blamed
At the top of the block there's a church
At the top of the tower there's the clock
And it rings and it sighs
'cause there's no time for all these lies
But baby that's this town
It won't happen next time
Yeah baby that's this town
Lovers on love downs
It's this town to be blamed
Baby take a walk round to my house
Throw off these tired eyes and tears and these frowns
Take that lane so narrow and deep and walk those regrets that fill your sleep
You say your sleep is naked and your dreams are clothed
But what about your footsteps
Who sees them go
Who lets you know about these things
Who's gonna say the things we think
So take your keys and pack your bags
But leave your books and leave your maps
'cause baby that's this town
It won't happen next time
Yeah baby that's this town
It won't happen next time
Yeah baby that's this town
It won't happen next time
Sure baby that's this town
Lovers on love downs
It's this town to be blamed
It's this town to be blamed
Work work work
Rain rain rain
Home home home
Again again again
Work work work
Rain rain rain
Home home home
Again again againEmbed
