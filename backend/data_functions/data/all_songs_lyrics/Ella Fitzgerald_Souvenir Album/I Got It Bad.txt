I Got It Bad Lyrics
Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental
Not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man and me
We gin some
And pray some
And sin some

He don't love me like I love him
No, nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good


Lord above me
Make him love me
The way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
Now, maybe I'm wrong to feel the way I do
I know my heart would never take somebody new
I got it bad and that ain't goodEmbed
