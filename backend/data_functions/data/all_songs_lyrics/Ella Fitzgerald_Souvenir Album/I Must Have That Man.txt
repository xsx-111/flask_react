I Must Have That Man LyricsI'm so unhappy, left all alone
Ain't got nobody to love now
The man I long for is not so strong for me
He's not an angel, but I don't care
Perhaps a change'll come some day
Whatever he is, I want to be his way
Don't want my mammy, I don't need a friend
My heart is broken, it won't ever mend
I ain't much carin' just where I will end
But I must have that man
I'm like an oven that's cryin' for heat
He treats me awful each time that we meet
It's just unlawful how that boy can cheat
I must have that man
He's hot as Hades, a lady's
Not safe in his arms when she's kissed
But I'm afraid that he's cooled off
And maybe I'm ruled off his list, I'll never be missed
I need that person much worse'n just bad
I'm half alive and it's drivin' me mad
He's only human, if he's to be had
I must have that man
When all the world is topsy turvy
One kiss from him and away go worry
That's how I know
I must have that manEmbed
