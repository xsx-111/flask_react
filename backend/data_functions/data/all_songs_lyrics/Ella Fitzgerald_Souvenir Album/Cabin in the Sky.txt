Cabin in the Sky Lyrics
There's a little cabin in the sky, baby
For me and for you
I feel that it's true somehow

Can't you see that cabin in the sky, baby
An acre or two of heavenly blue to plow

We will be oh-so gay
Eat fried chicken every day
As the angels go sailing by
That is why my heart is flyin' high, baby
'Cause I know we'll have a cabin in the sky

We will be oh-so gay
Eat fried chicken every day
As the angels go sailing by
That is why my heart is flying high, baby
'Cause I know we'll have a cabin in the skyEmbed
