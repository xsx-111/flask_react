Hope to Die Lyrics
Gone was the way we were
Just like the days we'd burn
Everything 'round us, baby

Take me back to the time
I was yours, and you were mine
Take me back to the words I'd say
I had to whisper
Because you liked it that way

I'm still undone, not quite young
But I, I still try
Cross my heart, now I hope to die

Was the way we were
Just like you'd say, we'd turn
Everything 'round us, baby

Take me back to the time
I was yours, and you were mine
Take me back to the world I know
You were crying
They don't cry where we go
I'm still undone, not quite young
But I, I still try
Cross my heart, now I hope to


And I'm still undone, I'm not quite young
But I, I still try
Cross my heart, now I hope to die
Cross my heart, now I hope to die2Embed
