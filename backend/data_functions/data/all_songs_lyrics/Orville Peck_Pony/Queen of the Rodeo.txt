Queen of the Rodeo Lyrics
Sleek heroine, just a man
Slow on the draw
Velvet gloves, you're still a stunner
Don’t be down, girl, this world is a bummer

Queen of the rodeo
You rode on in with nowhere else to go
You know the tune so the words don't matter
Beyond this town lies a life much sadder, babe
I know
Another evening show
Queen of the rodeo

Sweet Marilyn, satin gown
Hard to ignore
Starry-eyed, a little younger
The night is long, your days are numbered

Queen of the rodeo
You're ridden out with nowhere else to go
You know the tune so the words don’t matter
Beyond this town lies a life much sadder, babe
I know
Another evening show
See you 'round
Still around
See you 'round
Steal the crown

Sleek heroine, just a man
Slow on the draw
They play your song, is it another?
Don't be down, girl, this world is a bummer

Queen of the rodeo
You rode on in with nowhere else to go
You know the tune so the words don't matter
Beyond this town lies a life much sadder, babe
I know
Another evening show
Queen of the rodeo4Embed
