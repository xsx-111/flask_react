Buffalo Run Lyrics
Hitch a ride on my makeup
I consider it another man's problem
Yeah, head on wide
Strike gold on my eyelids
Got a sister, knows nothing but violence
Yeah, head on wide

Hitch a ride on my violence
Live in fear, got a fever in silence
Yeah, head on wide

I caught you staring at the sun
Looking out for number one
Yeah, head on wide
I saw the dare on your lips
Another truth in my fist
Yeah, head on wide

Strike time on my target
Pulling leather, tug a rosary on it
Yeah, head on wide
Rawhide on your polish
Strike a match, leave a lick and a promise
Yeah, head on wide
I caught you staring at the sun
Looking out for number one
Yeah, head on wide
I saw the dare on your lips
Another truth in my fist
Yeah, head on wide

See the buffalo run (Run, run, run)
Run (Run, run, run)
Run (Run, run, run)
Run (Run, run, run)Embed
