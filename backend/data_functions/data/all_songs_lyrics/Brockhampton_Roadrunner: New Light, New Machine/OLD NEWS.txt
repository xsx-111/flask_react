OLD NEWS Lyrics
I did this all for you (for you)
(I did, I did, I did this all for you)

I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
They’re oh-so old, be new!
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news

I wish it didn't end like this
You stopped lovin' me a long time ago, didn't notice
Pardon the waves, couldn't contain how I feel about it
Easy to say I'm to blame, no other way around it
How you say you don't love me like you used to?
Solitude is becoming so unusual
Old news that you rush into everything
That's why I'm stuck here tellin' you, you

I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
They’re oh-so old, be new!
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news
Say less, rain check, we friends, I guess
I got regrets, hop in Lexus
You don't hear me, but I bought your earrings (What?)
From the PJ's, treat you like an heiress
I ain't trickin', but I got it for your hair and nails (What?)
I always treat 'em too good, and it always fails (I'm winnin')
You an angel, I'm the one that tripped and fell (I’m chillin’)
Can't let go, I missed my own fairytale (I did it)

I'm out my head, I'm in my notebook, I'm feelin' hopeful
I joined The Band in Dylan's tour bus, turn up my vocals
Still makin' faces at your GoPro, like, "Fuck the promo"
I'll do the live show for a one-horse town
The blue-black behind my eyelids of an unheard sound
The words cracked into a silence of a sun gone down
But no regrets, coyote, baby, you can watch me howl
We're just so different, you and I, I guess we both know now
I guess we both know now

I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
They’re oh-so old, be new!
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news
Wish I knew what it meant when I said I loved you (I love you)
Rips in the threads of the net I fell through (Ah)
What I gotta do for you?
Bet my life, paid the price
Almost died, shit was tight (For real)
What a life to lose
Beautiful and tragic, it rang true
Pleasure and pain, both remain (They do)
I was amazed in the maze with you
Said what I meant, meant what I said too
If you only knew...

Tell them keep your faith to the sky
(Keep your faith to the sky)
Tell them keep6Embed
