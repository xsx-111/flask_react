WINDOWS Lyrics
Shit, I was just talking 'bout
Just, that grind, the trenches, just
You know what I'm sayin', just all that
I mean, you-you don't get the vibe of it?

Feels good to get this shit out the mud, nigga
Made it from hard times, it's still love for the slums, nigga
We rob niggas just because, nigga
And I'll serve you anything, but nothin' less than a dub, nigga
And how it feel to be a dub, nigga?
I'm tryna be a better man but nothin' less than a thug, nigga
I kill shit, just check my background (Bah)
This murder gang shit my campground
Check my résumé or ask 'round (Yeah)
We just simply never back down (Nah)
I caught a charge, now I'm back out
I bet this carbon blow his back out
Gettin' money, that's a fact now (Merlyn)
Bitches, they don't know how to act now (Merlyn)

The poor more polite, but thе flow not nice (No)
Watch for your wife, I might take hеr out your life (You know)
She wet my white tee, now it's like a wet wipe (Wet it)
Respect my Tribe, I'm a dog like Phife (Get it?)
You love me like a check, but my name not Nike (Get it?)
Bitch, my number not a lottery
I'm like, "Don't even talk to me" (Stop)
Honestly, wouldn't fly a Melbourne chick to Sydney, no (Go Merlyn,  Go Merlyn)
All of these bars bought chains, prison industries (Go Merlyn, Go Merlyn, Go Merlyn)
True, America did my people foul, then give me shot for free (Go Merlyn, Go Merlyn)
While I watch Washington's wooden teeth in her booty cheeks
Kings of last century, was living like peasantry
I don't even like sleep, time is the only luxury
Sendin' a fuck you to you all
I'ma ship it, laminate it, got this shit straight off the lot
We ain't renting no AVIS
Got the neighbors going crazy
It's me, Bari, and Flexy
I can see through your bullshit, like your face was made of plexi' (Haha)
I could fuck around and get to soundin' like I'm whinin' man
Only crybaby is the one inside the buggy, man
Who, I'm the bogeyman
You, never sleep again
Nightmares, it's fright-filled the moment Freddy tuck you in
Stack my money higher than the foam atop a tidal wave
Lonely like the point guard at the key, got the isolate
Light it up, light it up, we bring the light show
Who the hell invited all they friends?
Fuck if I know (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

They at your window (Them boy calling for you)
They at your window (Them boy coming for you)
They at your window (You better not tell no lies)
They at your window (You know them boys outside)
They at your window (Them boy calling for you)
They at your window (Them boy coming for you)
They at your window (You better not tell no lies)
And they ain't coming to play
You should not tell no lies
My pen could be a fortune teller or an ATM
It's got intentions of its own, I can't even pretend
Every moment is a fight nobody can defend
The circumstances should've never been there to begin
I watch the clocks melt as the Devil dances
The chances are slim to none that you could understand this
Lost language we incantin', pain campin'
Amongst the stillborn raindrops is where I'm standin'
I wake up breakin' up an eighth just to function
Rather be in neutral than continue to get sunken
All my niggas made it out the motherfuckin' dungeon
Tank has been on E, but I gotta keep runnin'
What you finna lean on when our system is crumbling?
Everybody's reaching but they really end up fumbling when they touchdown
Y'all don't appreciate in value like a bust down
My shit authentic, they can never get enough now

They at your window (Them boy calling for you)
They at your window (Them boy coming for you)
They at your window (You better not tell no lies)
And they ain't coming to play
You should not tell no lies

I can see the eye upon me when I close mine
Drug-induced comatosis leaking through me blind
The body is the temple, I invite spirits
We crack riddles and giggle behind closed blinds
Born to bleed, the brave and free
Got needs they gotsta feed, I breathe to see defeat
Fuck police and authority
Never means nothing, mind-fucking myself to sleep
Had to take it to the streets
Capitalistic greed plague all society like COVID-19
Those dirty hands that feed don't buy it
Government officials, don't give a fuck about the children
What do you believe?
Nothing's ever what it seems 'til you can't deny it
Flashpoints and flashbangs dictate defiance
History stuck on repeat in the loop of sirens
Terrorizing, always lying
Goddamn tyrants
Don't play with knives, kid
I tried to warn you
These boys, they don't know you
Outside, comin' for you
'Cause they don't love you and they don't know you
I tried to warn you
These boys, they don't know you
Outside, comin' for you
'Cause they don't love you and they don't owe you shit

Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Yeah, nigga
We back up in this thing (Road)
Sometimes it's like, all or nothin' (Road)
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like

Just pick me up in the four-door
I'll bless the beat with smoke and rain ash like Mordor
The warlord's comin', check the lamb for the slaughter
The envy so green it should be flying a saucer, yeah
And when the pressure is on, they gone
Ghost ride whippin' not your friends no more, so long
Snake sneakin' I'm feeling like I'm missin'
But never that I'm still here bitch, so God's winnin'
Lord willing (Lord willing)
There's no ceiling (No ceiling)
They all pussy (All pussy)
Get out your feelings (Get out your feelings)
Can try and run it up but baby I'm chillin' (Uh-huh)
I make my money, then dip, stay killin'
Stay killin', stay killin', stay killin'

Why you always start prayin' when that trouble come around?
(Why you always start prayin' when that trouble come around?)
There them boys go again
