THE LIGHT Lyrics
I give, my mom so, —mess
In the same house my dad died in, all alone
Tryin' not to be paranoid, tryin' not— as they're calling it
'Cause every headline is a reminder that the world's fucked
So I'm just tryin' to see the light
In between the clouds
Still love that sunshine

When I look at myself, I see a broken man
Remnants of my pops, put the Glock to his head
Nothing ever go as planned, couldn't make amends
Forcibly pretend I don't give a damn
At a loss, aimless, six feet deep
Suffocatin', can't face it
Can't change it, ain't make it
Master plans by the Maker, I see no savior
Morbid reflection and stainless steel, alcohol and pills
Deadly combinations left with nothin' else to feel
A floral haven, hope it was painless, I see you in the faces
Places and my making, reflections off a broken mirror
Fragments of my fear glarin' back like, "Who's there?"
I can't stand myself, beside myself, I see you there
I know you cared
Felt numb since September when I heard the news
What I'd do to speak one last time
Think I always will be haunted by the image of a bloody backdrop Skull fragments in the ceilin', felt your presence in the room
Heard my mother squealin'
Master of disguises, ash to ash, dust to dust
Voids behind my eyelids, blacking out, bleeding out
Silence louder than a twisted tongue lying
As sick as our secrets
Shadow people and needles fading through a peephole
Bedtime stories from purgatory, I miss you
For the record, I can fly
Around the world absorbing light
Something's missing deep inside
The light

Somethin' changed in Texas, guess I missed the message
Look, I missed my exit, I'm living like a Jetson
I was broke and desperate, leanin' on my best friends
Only shot callers I was around was bartendin'
Ain't no love in this game, mama, this is not tennis
Take your shoes off, we just did the carpets in
I can the take the hatin', I can take the praisin'
It's all noise to me, I'll turn into Satan
Y'all stuck in The Matrix
Red pill, blue pill, all these different faces
All these different cases, shit, y'all done seen me naked
So I'ma wear what I want now and I ain't finna fake it
Thank God I made it, thank God I seen God last summer
I was standing on the bridge, I seen all y'all under me
Know you are struggling, niggas out here juggling
Losin' jobs and losing God, then everything is tumbling
Feel Heaven rumbling, the rapture is coming
I love the attention, I'm a bastard in public
I still struggle with tellin' my mom who I'm in love with
Subtleties in between, way these diamonds gleam
When Thanksgiving come around, I still don't see 'em
When Christmas come around, nigga, I still don't see 'em
Told the world who I was before I got to know Ian
They gave my people money in exchange for their freedom
I would give it all back for a chance to free 'em16Embed
