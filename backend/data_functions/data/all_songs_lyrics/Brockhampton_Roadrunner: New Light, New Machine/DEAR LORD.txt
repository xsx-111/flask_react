DEAR LORD Lyrics
Dear Lord
Lord, will You come down and help out my brother? Oh
So please Lord
He needs You more, oh
I want You to let him know that he's still loved (Still loved)
So when Your love shines through like the light
Let him know You want him to fight (Where do I go now?)
So God bless you love
Heal him with Your light
Oh, prayin' all the time to You
Show him to the light
Ooh, ooh, oh, hold him in Your light
Oh, hold him in Your light (Yeah)
Show him Your light, aw yeah (Oh, yeah)
So when Your love shines through like the light
Let him know You want him to fight
Waiting by Your side
He just needs Your love and Your light6Embed
