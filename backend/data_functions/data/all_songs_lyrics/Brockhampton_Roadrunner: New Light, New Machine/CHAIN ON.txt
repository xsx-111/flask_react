CHAIN ON Lyrics
One, two

Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell 'em boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga, tryna say
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell 'em boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga, tryna say

Fifth string, Young Peggy Ringo (Go)
Slick with the ink, these melodies need Duolingo (Shit)
Same size as Dua Lipa, where the fuck my pen go?
Second fiddle to weirdos, you feel like Eddie Winslow
Street Fighter like Birdie, keep a stick like Rolеnto
Did you win if your purpose is just perfect potеntial?
Did you live up to it, is you just doin' the minimum?
Used to get fifty views, now they need Peggy's momentum (Yeah)
Let's check the addendum
Switch the code, I'm speakin' prophecies like That's So Raven
Bald-headed with lil status, I feel like Maven
But I be dressed like Raven, up in the studio slavin'
Wonder how Peggy be— (Wait, wait)
Wonder how Peggy be cakin'? I be Easy Bakin'
My oven stay prepped and ready for the heat to take it
Niggas that took this road and failed ain't have proper placement
Some of you niggas don't look well, does Peggy make you hate him?
Is it how I make the beats sound like Poltergeist? (Huh?)
Or when my homies bring my name up is it breedin' spite?
It's all talent, perfectly balanced, young Supreme Kai
Who am I? Wake up every morning like it's do or die
No surprise, suits get jealous when you cut the ties
Livin' lie, Lance Armstrong at the finish line
Give it time, when we catch them cops on cam
I don't need six seconds, you remember Vine
It's nasty
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell 'em boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga, tryna say
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell 'em boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga, tryna say

Hangin' from a chandelier in Babylon
We don't believe in white gods, they gettin' rattled on
Been in the belly of the kingdom, you can't tag along
Unless you got war on the mind, to get the shackles off
You can't ignore the karma when it's flames across your lawn
We checkin' corners, so make sure our lanes don't come across
See, word from Marvin, couldn't sue me from "What's Goin' On"
Movin' through the system, sprintin' through a marathon
We don't get second chance
And they don't need a reason now, so I don't let 'em plan
When I been fighting for the truth, I bring some extra hands
Cement inside my gloves to knock this shit into the fan
Put that on everything I love
It's been a minute, had to flip
It's in my blood to be a stack
Had to handle other business
Ain't no riddles, it's a fact
If you see me and my energy ain't really tryna chat
That's them generations chargin' the battery in my back
See, I'm fueled by the culture, driven by my ancestors
Body just a vessel, brain tapped into the answers
Tried to see me on the CCTV, couldn't scan 'em
Like the serial was scratched off on the barrel of the branding
I been ten toes down with the city on my shoulders
You got no idea how that weight could make you colder
Screamin', "Free my niggas," 'til they free it's never over
Spirit said, "It's time for me to really be a soldier now"
Cash rules everything around me (Uh)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all (Yeah), y'all (Yeah)9Embed
