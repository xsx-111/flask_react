COUNT ON ME Lyrics
You look so different to me
It's like you barely even, listen

You look so different to me
It's like you barely even know me
You was missin' for me
Swear I'm tired of feelin' lonely
Like Field Mob song, Trill Mob boy
She been MIA far too long, so far
Now catch the compensation
Change the conversation, dollars all I'm chasin'
Ain't talkin' money, fuck is you sayin'?
I'm non-comprehensive, money finish sentences
No, I ain't sensitive, nigga, just highly offended

It'll be okay, no matter what thеy say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll bе okay
You ain't even need no money
You can count on me
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll be okay
You ain't even need no money
You can count on me
Let's not fake the funk
She say I pour too much in my cup
Fuck the opposition, plus I'm still ridin' with it tucked
They say I should change the way I'm livin'
But just can't get enough
Still be quick to up that chopper on his block and hit him up
My little brothers don't come home 'til November
I told 'em we gon' live it up
Can't do shit but pray for J Ron 'cause that nigga don't give a fuck
Not at all, nigga
Had my back against the wall, nigga
Momma told me I'd see it all, nigga

Yeah, who love you at your lowest of lows?
I know, I mean
I'm in the backyard thinkin' I need
That smoke puffing outta my teeth
I'm good, I got my green
Sittin' back, sippin', ocean breeze
I don't got it baby, ask them boys
All that hating turn to white noise
Tryna get red carpet fly
I don't flex my life, I don't lie
Treat life like I might die
Don't like myself sometimes
But I bet that come with time
Ever feel like your head got screws a little bit loose?
Goddamn, give a fuck if I lose
Ain't no fool, he got déjà vu
I'm the man, I'm the dog, got juice
Just know I fucked up, too
Talk like you got it figured it out
And I wish I did too
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll be okay
You ain't even need no money
You can count on me
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll be okay
You ain't even need no money
You can count on me

Count on me
