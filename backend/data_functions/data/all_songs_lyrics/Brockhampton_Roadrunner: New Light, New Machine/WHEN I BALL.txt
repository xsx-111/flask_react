WHEN I BALL Lyrics

My mama said I didn’t come into this world with tears
Instead, I welcomed her with open eyes and open ears
Became the glue to a few things that couldn’t be repaired
We saw our future in each other, blending hope and fear
Some things you don’t get to decide, it’s just a fate you share
I used to try to hold the weight that she would need to bear
Watched uncles going on vacation for a couple years
When thеy came back they needed clothеs and had no souvenirs
I pick up the phone, they’re calling us from correction
But nothing is wrong, it’s filling my heart with questions
My mama is home, I’m following her expressions
A drop in her tone, some things that she had to mention
I nodded, I listened, she had all of my attention
"When you on your own, there gonna be some directions
I need you to follow and never make an exception"
I nodded; she held me and wished I would be protected

You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be with you
On my sucker-free shit since I was a fetus
Pullin’ up at the doc in a Mazda 626
Bet my dad was trippin’ bad, hit the gas like car-chase
Light blue in the back, mama gettin' labor pains
Dropped my sister at the Bulls' like house was twenty-three
Sweat dripping down my face like river runnin’ free
Dark morning with the fog pourin’ in and out the trees
Every movement through they eyes seem to zoom at lightspeed
Before me, she lost one, stillborn tragedy
Grittin’ the teeth down to the root, pain like a cavity
Holdin' hands like they glued, radio channel on news
Valentines with a "X" up on the calendar
They knew I would be a fuckin’ baller like them posters on the wall
A little stain could be the beauty in it all
Amidst all the trouble, most your luck was rubbin’ off
Stickin’ to you like moss—you my Kate, you my rock
Forever

You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it’s hard to see
It's hard to be with you
Here I go, I'm gonna spread my wings
All grown up, let go and look at me
You'll always be (You'll always be)
A part of me (A part of me)
Here I go, I'm gonna spread my wings
All grown up, let go and look at me
You'll always be (You'll always be)
A part of me (A part of me)
That's why

A part of me, a part of me, a part of me, a part of me
A part of me, a part of me, a part of me, a part of me
That's why4Embed
