THE LIGHT PT. II Lyrics
The light

The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it

Sick of these niggas givin' me false info
Like I ain't grow up on MTV, Boondocks and The Chappelle Show
Bitch I can handle the truth
That's how I entered the booth
Look at all these bruises I got
It gave me so much confidence
Back when I was makin' songs at my momma's crib
The candle's lit, the temperature rising
What type of man can find the right time to fly in
Especially when my cousin dyin'
Should've never sold my soul
Should've protected all my opinions
To see the world move without you feel like a daydream
Kool-aid stands, band-aids wrapped around your beautiful hands
Protect me from the city
Couldn't save me from the world back then
Had Jeezy on repeat in your whip
No peace in my streets
And these days, no license
Only take the Jeep if my boyfriend is drivin'
Plus he got the kinda skin that make the police like him
Ever since I was a kid, I always felt so frightened
My momma from the ghetto
Her vote go to any nigga that keep Jesus in the convo
Me and her just get on good terms
Thank God for them unexpected turns
Breaks her heart when she see my city burn
Thank God for teachin' me how to learn to have empathy even when it burns
But I hate that you got me in this box expecting me to see the light
See the light, see the light
All my niggas to the right, right, right
You see the light, light, light, light
And all my niggas to the left, right
Left, right, left, right
You see the light, light, light, light, light, light
When that hammer pulled back, did you think of me?
You were the one that taught me how to be
Look at me now, in all my glory
Overcame a lot, that's a different story
Abandoned by the life-giver
Looking back at my life different
Deep cuts in the dusk of the final gasp before your life flashed
What happens when you die?
Does it fade black?
I sense you in my skin and the trucker cap
Miss it when we laughed
Didn't trust my intuition when I saw the cracks
I'm sorry
All I ever want to do is make you proud
Fleeting moments
Always found a way around the frown
Set aside the pain to celebrate the now
Couldn't kick me out the house, I was fucked up
Nothing to prove without doubt if I'm man enough
What's the use?
I could use you, 'cause I'm scared as fuck
Tuck me in
Always young enough to feel loved
And share some
Are you lookin' down?
Inner child reachin' out
Brittle-boned crying out
The past does not define you
The past does not define you
The burden was too much
Couldn't save you from yourself when you'd self-destruct
Couldn't save me from myself when I'd push my luck
To tell the truth I am just like you
Left it all in the pistol that you used
Always be your little man
Following your footsteps even though I'm mad
Even though you're gone you live on
And the day I have kids I'll tell them 'bout grandpa
And how great he is
And the grandkids
Grandkids you'll never meet
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be
Neither would they
It's safe to say I'll find a way out the darkness
The way you left Ma hits me the hardest
What a shame things change in the blink of an eye
Fade away, fast break to the depths in the sky
Impermanence turned permanent with a 9
That's life, that's life
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it14Embed
