BANKROLL Lyrics
Coo-coo
Yeah!

Shit on your function, live from the dungeon (Woo, damn)
Don't know why you cuffin', my dick, she be tonguin'
You ain't got drip like this, can't talk like this (Woo)
Safety pin on wrist, I put racks on my lil' bitch, uh
Speak of the truth, two K a tooth, oof
Maybach Jeep, huh, raise the roof
Know that you envy me, but I am hater-proof
Talkin' with Diddy, I made me a milli' in about a day or two
Woo, ayy, filled with lust
Wanted to hear what Hype Williams talkin' 'bout
Bitches that I wanna bust
We supposed to be talkin' 'bout video treatments and such (Damn)
But I'm busy lovin' on the IG, smut, damn, fuck
I'm a G.O.A.T. in a Lamb' truck
Tell the video, "Pan up when you talk to me"
Godzilla, trilla nigga, rip apart cities (Coo-coo)
Side niggas in the pocket of my varsity (Damn)

They couldn't take that from me
They want love, they got me, listen
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at a party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place always comin' in your dreams (Bankroll)
Lump up in my jeans, I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Never show them that lil' green, I keep a bankroll (Bankroll)
And I'm walkin' with a limp, got too much bankroll (Bankroll)
Huh, huh, I got too much bankroll

Won't take off my armor now
Can't afford not to splurge on her
Had to break down the Berlin Wall
Just to come talk to ya
Who hurt ya? I'll break his jaw
Young, handsome, with major plans
Know I'm harsh to my consonance
Know I'm harsh to my consonance
Make her run like the Boston bomb
I'm the one, yeah, the one she wants
Wanna love me like Wimbledon
Raise the volume, ring alarm
Hands on my girl, it's a charm
Got passion, don't call it loud
Don't tell my shorty, "Settle down"
I wear out like a hand-me-down
Don't say I'm too big for ya
Man, my head big, it's fallin' off
But I fit, no problem
Make it fit like nuts and bolts
One nut and I'm boltin' off
Your ex income minimum
Baby run with some bigger dons
Baby run with some bigger dons
I got the cash and it last 'cause I dash to the bag
My ice white like rice, diamonds flash like the light, ayy
They couldn't take that from me
They want love, they got me, listen
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at a party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place always comin' in your dreams (Bankroll)

Lump up in my jeans, I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Never show them that lil' green, I keep a bankroll (Bankroll)
And I'm walkin' with a limp, got too much bankroll (Bankroll)
Huh, huh, I got too much bankroll

Wanna be my main bitch? You gotta get the cream
To roll around me in the Grenadines
You gotta come through lookin' pristine
'Cause this bankroll is flowin'
Aim for the neck, I ain't goin' (Uh)
Yeah I'm gettin' money like a bank machine (Uh)
It got me lookin' legit and they know it (Yeah)
Yeah I'm countin' up, ain't gotta show it off
See me in your spot, low-key throwin' you off
If you talkin' 'bout cash in my ear like a kitty
You know that it's stayin' up
If you ain't on that, move back, bro
Don't even talk to the gang, no
Walkin' 'round, tool with the bankroll
Keep puttin' stacks in the bank, bro
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me
(Now catch the compensation)
Every time you at a party, it's a scene
(Change the conversation)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing
(Dollars, all I'm chasin')
Sunken place always comin' in your dreams
(Fuck is you sayin'?)16Embed
