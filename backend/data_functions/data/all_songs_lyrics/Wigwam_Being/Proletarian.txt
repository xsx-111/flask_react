Proletarian Lyrics
Worn through by now, all spent... my pain
Property, trickery, political treasury
Politics, lush lies

Bitterness, repeating myself, impotence and the pink backs
Suction-directed... us being breathed into stupor
Sucking, scabbing, I scratch and I'm punished

The mob ever drunker, comrades there always
And the leaders, the bosses, responsibility fails
Salaries soar, graftsmanship grows, competence decaysEmbed
