Marvelry Skimmer Lyrics
Introducing my friend from the fields
Don't have much money, you know how it feels
Down at the heels
Chasing the blackbirds away

(Ah-hah, ah-hah
Forever, ah-hah
Forever, now)

Hi-falootin', I've got my turnips and peels
Don't have no shovel, you know how it feels
Down at the heels
Chasing the blackbirds away

Old scarecrow getting nearer than near
Well, he could be a schizo or maybe a queer
We won't know 'til we get it together

(Ah-hah
Forever, ah-hah
Forever, now)
Hi-falootin', turnips and peels
Don't have (ehh) no money (ya' know), know how it feels
Down at the heels
Chasing the blackbirds away

(Ah-hah, ah-hah
Forever, ah-hah
Forever, now)Embed
