Prophet Lyrics
TENDING CONSCIOUSNESS; LAND · toward which
STATECRAFT · and LIVING · SPIRIT ·
In a hundred years will seek
Each other for the first time

LAND · Time Suppliant
In which the last of the chosen few
Stands lost in the strait of the narrow
STATECRAFT · Promised Remorse
Out of which deceit and power greed
Confided centuries ago



LIVING · Denied Fulfillment
From which no turning back
SPIRIT · Creator Peregrine
Who shall want nothing
RADIANT THE COMMANDMENT;
THAT THE COURSER TOO ILLUMINATE IT'S MUTILATED SHADOWEmbed
