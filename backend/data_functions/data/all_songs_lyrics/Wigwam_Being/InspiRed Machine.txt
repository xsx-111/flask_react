InspiRed Machine Lyrics
Working men in all countries let us unite in vengeance
For the time has come to annihilate the bourgeoisie
And suck up the rest, now's the time
When communism will rule the world
And red shall be the one color suffered to wave
Let us take up arms, let us join forces comrades
Let us march, let us conquer
For behind us comrades
You have the most powerful and advanced nation in the world
Also the world's most modern least checked weapons
And the Red
Army comrades towards peace and happiness on Earth
Towards the most ethical and natural
State and system in the world, comrades!!!Embed
