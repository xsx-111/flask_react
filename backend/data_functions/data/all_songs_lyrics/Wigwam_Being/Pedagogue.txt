Pedagogue Lyrics
All half-beings: let your lips partake
Of sentience, and the words will
Words will be given meaning too
All half-beasts: open up your ears
To receive knowledge, and you'll belong
Belong among those who have ideas
All half-humans: open up your eyes to behold
Talent, and you'll light on your own
Light on your own dead capacity

(You better) buy up your conscience
And invest it in your neighbor to attain
Peace external and self maximizing profit

(For heavens sake) don't slow the rise of your
Standard of living by revelry · Production; fast instead
On the Third World Arms Trade touching down full speed

Destroy knowingly your cars, hands
M.D.s, years earnings, meals, homes and you still
And you still won't understand just what war makes you live with
Hurl the soul into the fame... stampede
And the wonders of property as history, then you won't
Then you won't have time to waste your time in vain
Bear starvation, fifty retarded babies
And break with the strength left into a smile
At the silver wings carrying
Carrying odearing tourists and two idiot hijackers

All man-marks – let the population pineapple
Work to measure
And start fitting nose to assEmbed
