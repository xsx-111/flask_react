Maestro Mercy Lyrics
Goodbye, dear Mother Earth
It's been nice knowing you
Goodbye, dear Mother Earth
It's been nice, I promise you

It was rain from the start but I knew we could make it
Make or break it, to open that door
To a new understanding for man in his glory
Or then we forsake it and worry no more

Goodbye, dear Mother Earth
It's been nice knowing you
Goodbye, dear Mother Earth
It's been nice, I promise you

It was rain from the start but I thought we could make it
Make or break it, to open that door
To a new understanding for man in his glory
Or then we forsake it and worry no moreEmbed
