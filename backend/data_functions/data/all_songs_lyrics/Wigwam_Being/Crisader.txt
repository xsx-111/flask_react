Crisader Lyrics
Angles, pole held in hiding
Catches dead fish, timorous rhythm, ceaseless
Ruptured... caressus
Catches dead fish and pours into pocket, at length

At length aware of death, rushes on
Wings of dread... for
Familiar tree, oblivious of
Pants, dry and warm change
Shackles locked with blessings
Opens book in exhaustion
And lectures on ichthyic reproduction

Vocation and responsibility
True winds of perdition trying to release, to cool
Trying to strengthen, but safe and righteous mirages
Bring low the desperate prayer
Money and me, we'll get any old tree
And money's the same whatever the gameEmbed
