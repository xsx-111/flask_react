Petty-Bourgeois Lyrics
Oh what a commotion
Bodies in the street, snipers in the yard
Jiminy cricket, everyone's at large
Bucket and a spade baling
Oh what a commotion
Snipers on the beat, policemen on the prowl
Stickety wicket, oh what a drag
Everyone's at sea, whaling

Give us a hint or a clue
Where do we start from and where do we go to
Give us a light in the cold
Merlin! Our fortune be told!

Sentimental memories won't do
In nineteen eighty two
When we will crawl like lice
Beneath a blade of hate (not nice)
And you my friend will feel like in a zoo
Hey monkey, is it true?
And I won't know, not I
'Cause you'll be me, and I'll be you
(Buh buh dudup, buh buh dudup
Talkin' 'bout disaster)
(Buh buh dudup, buh buh dudup
Talkin' 'bout disaster)

Cauliflowers, turnip peels and rotten eggs and spew
Old tin cans and bottle tops and cabbage, plastic glue
Poka mola soft soapola, choca rocka stew
Mix 'em up and melt them down, so there's your little clue
Look out! Sunny disaster! Sunny disaster!

Disaster can be fun
If you give up lettuce
Give up smell, touch, Sunday lunch
Disaster can be fun
If you give up breathing
Give up hope, TV and the radio
Disaster can be very nice, if you simply live like lice
Disaster can be very nice

Oh what a commotion
Bodies in the street, snipers in the yard
Jiminy cricket, oh what a drag
Everyone's at large Embed
