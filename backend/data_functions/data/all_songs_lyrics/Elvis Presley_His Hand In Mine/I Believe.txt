I Believe Lyrics
I believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way
I believe, I believe
I believe above a storm the smallest prayer
Can still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word

Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why
I believe (believe, I believe)
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why
I believe (I believe)1Embed
