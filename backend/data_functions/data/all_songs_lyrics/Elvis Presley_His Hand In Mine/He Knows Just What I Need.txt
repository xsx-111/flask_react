He Knows Just What I Need Lyrics
My Jesus knows when I am lonely
He knows each pain, he sees each tear
He understands each lonely heartache
He understands because he cares

My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes, He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies
Yes, he knows just what I need
My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes, He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies
Yes, he knows just what I need2Embed
