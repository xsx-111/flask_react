Working on the Building LyricsWell, I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation
I'm holding up the blood-stained
Banner for my Lord
Well, I never get tired, tired, tired
Of working on the building
I'm going up to heaven
To get my reward, my reward
Well, I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation
I'm holding up the blood-stained
Banner for my Lord
Well I never get tired, tired, tired
Of working on the building
I'm going up to heaven
To get my reward, my reward
Well, I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation
I'm holding up the blood-stained
Banner for my Lord
Well, I never get tired, tired, tired
Of working on the building
I'm going up to heaven
To get my reward (my reward)
Well, I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation
I'm holding up the blood-stained
Banner for my Lord
Well, I never get tired, tired, tired
Of working on the building
I'm going up to heaven
To get my reward (my reward)
Well, I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation
I'm holding up the blood-stained
Banner for my Lord
Well, I never get tired (I'll never get tired)
From working on the building (for my Lord)
I'm going up to heaven, oh Lord
To get my rewardEmbed
