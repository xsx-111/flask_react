Swing Down Sweet Chariot Lyrics
Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me Lord, rock me Lord
Calm and easy
Well, I got a home on the other side
Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me Lord, rock me Lord
Calm and easy
Well, I got a home on the other side

Well, well (sweet sweet sweet)
Well, well, well, well (sweet sweet sweet)

Ezekiel went down in the middle of a field
He saw an angel working on a chariot wheel
Wasn't so particular 'bout the chariot wheel
Just wanted to see how a chariot feel
Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me Lord, rock me Lord
Calm and easy
Well, I got a home on the other side

Well, well (sweet sweet sweet)
Well, well, well, well (sweet sweet sweet)

Ezekiel went down and he got on board
Chariot went a bumping on down the road
Zeke wasn't so particular 'bout the bumping of the road
Just wanted to lay down his heavy load

Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me Lord, rock me Lord
Calm and easy
Well, I got a home on the other side
Well I got a Father in the promised land
Ain't no more stopping till I shake His hand
Rock me Lord, rock me Lord
Calm and easy
I got a home on the other side

Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me Lord, rock me Lord
Calm and easy
Well, I got a home on the other side2Embed
