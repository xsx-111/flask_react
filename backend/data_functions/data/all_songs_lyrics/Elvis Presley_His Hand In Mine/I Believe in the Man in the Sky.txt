I Believe in the Man in the Sky Lyrics
The steps that lead to any church
Form a stairway to a star
They're part of God and should be trod
More often than they are

I believe in the man in the sky (the man in the sky)
I believe with His help I'll get by (His help I'll get by)
My footsteps may falter
My eyes may grow dim
But He's my Gibraltar
I'm trusting in Him

Though a sparrow is all I may be (is all I may be)
On me, He will still keep an eye
Yes I'm singing His praise
Till the end of my days
I believe in the man in the sky

(Though a sparrow) Sparrow (is all I may be) Sparrow am I
(On me, He will still keep an eye) Keep an eye
Yes I'm singing His praise
Till the end of my days
I believe in the man in the sky (sky, man in the sky)2Embed
