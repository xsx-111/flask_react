Song of the Minerals LyricsEat yourself out of house and home
Go home, there's nothing there because
You ate yourself out of house and home
Throw up, you do it again
Make a meal of nothing at all
Why?
It makes you feel better
The only thing in your life you own
It's alright
If it makes you feel better
Cut yourself up and down your arms - both arms
If it makes you feel better
They're your arms
It's none of my business, it's
It's none of my business
If it makes you feel better
Fucking you is a total stranger
You picked him up but he's a total stranger
Why?
It makes you feel better
It's none of my business
If it makes you feel better
It's alright
If it makes you feel better
It's alright
If it makes you feel better
It's alright
If it makes you feel better
It's alright
If it makes you feel better
