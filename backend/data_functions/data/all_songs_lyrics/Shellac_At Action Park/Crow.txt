Crow Lyrics
He flies, as a crow flies, straight to her...
Why?
To tell her something...
He promises her he will not do
All the things he has already done to her
She flies, as a crow flies, straight to him...
Why?
To listen...
Time flies, as a crow flies, in a straight line
Through you, not around you -
Your life is only that with which time has it's way with you

In the corner
Of my eye
On the tracks
Will not fly
Underneath
And unseen
Trapped beak
Unafraid
Black streak
In the corner
Wait until
It gets warmer
Rain brain
Do the honor
Swing blade
Underwater
Don't eat the crow!!
Don't eat crow!!
In the corner
Of my eye
In the corner
Was the sky
In the corner
With the bird
Final caw
Went unheard
Don't eat the crow!!
Don't eat crow!!Embed
