The Idea of North LyricsHe was from up north
Part of the north academy
It could have been anywhere
Let's say it was... wants
Imagine living and goin' nuts
Sitting caught in the void
Imagine days without numbers attached
Drinking of course
I wrote him a letter
Said "I'll never come home!"
But he never sent it
But he wrote it again and again
Stacked up to the ceiling
Then another stack
Burn them all winter
For heat
Picture a chair
And the way that he sits in it
He looks out the window
I think he believes in itEmbed
