My Black Ass LyricsGonna eat what I pick
And I hope you choke on it
About to break a sweat
Too late
For Satchel Paige
It's a Gary Cooper story
And it shines like Sammy's knee
Gonna eat what I pick
And I hope you choke on it
When I dance I raise the dead
Drop a nickel in my hat
I'm going to give you a big smile
I'm bout to break a sweat
