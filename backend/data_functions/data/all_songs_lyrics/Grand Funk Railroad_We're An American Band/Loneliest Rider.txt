Loneliest Rider LyricsA long, long time ago there lived an Indian boy
When he came upon this Earth he brought his family joy
A paranoid young brave was he, inside his frame was some misery
He heard the other warriors talking angrily 'bout the white man taking over his country
CHORUS
What he didn't know, is that some day his ma would be crying
What he didn't know, is that some day his tribe would be dying
What he didn't know, is that some day his father'd be gone
What he didn't know, is that some day he'd be all alone
None of the stories in the schoolbooks said it, the truth is gone and they're tryin' to forget it
The history books are all one-sided, the truth is gone and their trying to hide it
Who had the land 'till we came around? The Indian made his life from the ground
And what about the boy that this story's about? Where his tee-pee once stood there now is a town
CHORUS
He was the loneliest rider on the plain
He was the loneliest rider on the plain
He was the loneliest rider on the plainEmbed
