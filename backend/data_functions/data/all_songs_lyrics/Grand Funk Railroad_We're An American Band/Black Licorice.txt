Black Licorice LyricsWhooo ... wheee!
You there, comin' up the stair, the feelin' is ice-blue cold
Shake, it's more than I can take, I'm startin' to lose control
Watch out, what's that noise, there's somebody at the door
It must be Black Licorice, she come back to make me cry some more
Time, ain't on my side, I'm losin' it more each day
Licorice, licorice
She's got evil in her eyes, and catnip is her taste
Licorice, licorice
She wraps me up in her slender legs, her hot black skin to mine
Licorice, licorice
Ple ... ple ...please, don't touch me, oh, I know I'm dead this time
Oh, oh, yeah ... Licorice, yeah, Black Licorice
Licorice, licorice
Licorice, yeah, Black Licorice
Licorice, licorice
Licorice, Black Licorice
Licorice, licorice
Licorice, yeah, Black Licorice
Licorice
Licorice
Licorice
Licorice
Licorice, yeah, Black Licorice
Licorice, licorice
Licorice, yeah, Black Licorice
Licorice, licorice
Licorice, licorice, Black Licorice
Licorice, licorice
Licorice, woah, Black LicoriceEmbed
