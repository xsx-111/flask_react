Miss Lucifer Lyrics
Skinny girl, dressed in black
Leather boots, Nazi hat
Tattooed panther, vampire cape
Sexy dancer, magdalene grace

Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby, shake!

Skinny girl, dressed in black
Leather boots, Nazi hat
Tattooed panther, vampire cape
Sexy dancer, magdalene grace

Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby, shake! Shake!

Panther girl, take me home
Hip to hip, bone to bone
Evil heat all night long
Evil heat all night long
Shake it, baby
(All night long)
Shake it, baby
(All night long)
Shake it, baby
(All night long)
Shake it, baby
(All night long)
Shake it, baby
(All night long)
Shake it, baby
(All night long)
Shake it, baby
(All night long)
Shake it, baby
(All night long)
Shake!

Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby, shake!Embed
