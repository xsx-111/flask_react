Skull X Lyrics
The sky's black with locusts
My eyes are burning stars
There's a mountain of gold teeth
In every bank vault in this world
Wanna try and steal my face
My body and my soul?
Ridden on a bed of nails
Walking into walls

Ooh, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, come on, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, come on, baby, do it again

Do I drown in my streams?
Do I kill you in my dreams?
Do I draw a knife across your throat?
Is your mouth an open grave?
Will I fall upon your blade?
Are those needles in your eyes?
The blood of Jesus?

Ooh, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, come on, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, come on, baby, do it again
Another teenage suicide
Slit your wrists and laugh
When boredom kills, shoot morphine pills
Be faithful unto death
In every home, a rapist
Our killers, family men
Why do children hate their parents?
Keep a shotgun underneath your bed

Ooh, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, come on, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, come on, baby, do it again

So fly the skull and crossbones
Burn the Union Jack
Hang onto your eyeballs
Paint the daytime black
Choose your best friends carefully
Don't betray your code
Live outside society
Stay inside your soul
Ooh, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, come on, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, come on, baby, do it again

Don't you find hard to laugh
When your mouth is full of broken glass?
Thoughts mutate to locusts, skull exploding
Don't you find hard to laugh
When your mouth is full of broken glass?
Thoughts mutate to locusts, skull exploding

Ooh, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, come on, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, do it again
Ooh, baby, come on, baby, do it again

Do it again
Come on, baby, do it again
Do it again
Come on, baby, do it again
Do it again
Come on, baby, do it again
Do it again
Come on, baby, do it againEmbed
