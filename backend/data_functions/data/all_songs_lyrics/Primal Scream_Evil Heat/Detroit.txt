Detroit Lyrics
They tore down the Berlin Wall
They let the hammer and sickle fall
They fitted me for a uniform
Had it ready the day I was born

I destroy everyone I love
I destroy everything I touch

I don't own my own skin
All I got is original sin
Brought down in a broken home
Mixed blood brittle bones

I destroy everyone I love
I destroy everything I touch

Love sex, female hex
Open eyes, empty legs
No release, exist to cease
Gimme a knife, break my teeth
They tore down the Berlin Wall
They tore down the Berlin Wall
They tore down the Berlin Wall
They tore down the Berlin WallEmbed
