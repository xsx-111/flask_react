City Lyrics
Everyone I see's diseased or broken
Holes in their arms, they got cocaine eyes
Self-mutilation is self-surveillance
Wanna get to heaven, you gotta die

Here she comes, here she comes
She's crawled out of a garbage can
Here she comes, here she comes
She's gonna waste another man

Ah, sick city, gonna be the death of me
Ah, sick city, gonna be my death
Gonna be the death of me

Little Johnny Junk's a subway pilot
He'll knife you in the head for Chinese rock
Catch a falling spike, ride a silver rocket
Score a body bag deal from the Vietcong

Here she comes, here she comes
She's crawled out of a garbage can
Here she comes, here she comes
She's gonna waste another man
Ah, sick city, gonna be the death of me
Ah, sick city, gonna be my death
Gonna be the death of me

Your meat on a hook in your own snuff movie
Torture loop hallucination, nerves spliced
No innoculation from the viral programme
There's spiders in your mouth, shoot insecticide

Here she comes, here she comes
She's crawled out of a garbage can
Here she comes, here she comes
She's gonna waste another man

Ah, sick city, gonna be the death of me
Ah, sick city, gonna be my death
Gonna be the death of me

Sick, sick, sick, sick city
Sick, sick, sick, sick city
Sick, sick, sick, sick city
Sick, sick, sick, sick city, sick cityEmbed
