Space Blues #2 LyricsOn the judgement day
When your name is called
And the oceans rise
And the mountains fall
Will the blood of Christ
Sanctify your soul?
Will you follow Satan
And the hell below?
On the judgement day
When your name is called
And the oceans rise
And the mountains fall
Will the blood of Christ
Sanctify your soul?
Will you follow Satan
And the hell below?Embed
