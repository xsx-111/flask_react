The Lord Is My Shotgun Lyrics
Cancer mind, graveyard dirt
Name on your tombstone, knife in your skirt
Head-on collision, motorcycle crash
Ain't going to prison, bury you alive

Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive

Bad seed, baby, gimme your disease
Death's head, angel, lay your curse on me
Lord is my shotgun, you're Satan's jewel
Plough your death valley, sow my seed in you

Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive

Bad seed, baby, gimme your disease
Death's head, angel, lay your curse on me
Lord is my shotgun, you're Satan's grand jewel
Plough your death valley, sow my seed in you
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive

Sometimes I think you're too sweet to die
Other times I think you should be buried alive

Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you alive
Bury you aliveEmbed
