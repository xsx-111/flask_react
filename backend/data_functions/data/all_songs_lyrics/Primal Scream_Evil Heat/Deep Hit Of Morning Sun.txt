Deep Hit Of Morning Sun Lyrics
Hey there, girl, summer girl
Suicidal, beautiful
I can see death in me
Death in you, love is good

Shine on me
Shine on everyone
Black is the colour
Deep hit of morning sun

Lose your friends one by one
To the needle, to the gun
To the virus, to the bomb
To slow death, to fast burn

Shine on me
Shine on everyone
Black is the colour
Deep hit of morning sun

Shine on me
Shine on everyone
Black is the colour
Deep hit of morning sunEmbed
