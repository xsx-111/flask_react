Some Velvet Morning Lyrics
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate

Flowers growing on a hill
Dragonflies and daffodils
Learn from us very much
Look at us but do not touch

Phaedra is my name

Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate

Flowers are the things we grow
Secrets are the things we know
Learn from us very much
Look at us but do not touch
Phaedra is my name

Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate

Some velvet morning when I'm straight
(Flowers are the things we grow)
(Secrets are the things we know)
I'm gonna open up your gate
(Learn from us very much)
(Look at us but do not touch)
(Look at us but do not touch)
(Look at us but do not touch)Embed
