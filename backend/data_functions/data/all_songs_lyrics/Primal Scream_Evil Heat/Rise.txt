Rise Lyrics
A life of work is a life of crime
You pay your taxes, you serve your time
All that money, where does it go?
Schools, prisons, hospitals, roads
Government funding of military science
Genetically engineered, ultraviolent
DNA, killer genes
To program microchips, marines
See stealth bombers and tomahawks
On CNN, pay-per-view war

Rise, rise
Rise, rise
Rise, rise
Rise, rise

Hey, wage slave, where's your profit share?
They got you down, they're gonna keep you there
Freeze your mind, metamorphose
Cocaine karma in the heroin zone
Multinational life is cheap
Soldiers, workers, maggots, meat
Get on up, protest riot
Are you collateral damage or a legitimate target?
Rise, rise
Rise, rise
Rise, rise
Rise, rise

Sweet sixteen dehumanized
Death's head, factory suicide
Sweet sixteen dehumanized
Death's head, factory suicide
Sweet sixteen dehumanized
Death's head, factory suicide
Sweet sixteen dehumanized
Death's head, factory suicide

Rise, rise
Rise, rise
Rise, rise
Rise, riseEmbed
