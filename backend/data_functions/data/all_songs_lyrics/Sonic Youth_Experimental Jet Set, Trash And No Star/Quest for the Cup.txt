Quest for the Cup Lyrics
You're the thrill of a million
Walking down the sidewalk
Feel like an alarm clock
Woke up and dressed up
Don't look like a t-shirt
I feel just like a donuts
Come and take the trash out
What's the use of crying
Don't look like a bummer
Feel just like a burger
Can I make him like me
Do you feel like I do
Don't look like a slip skirt
I feel just like a poser
I don't look like an angel
I GUESS I'll put some jeans on
Make my lips look redder
True you still look better

This is for Lisa
Ran away to the west
Faxed my mom for the test
Couldn't stay for the rest
Then I met him Jess
He is just the best
We kissed right under a tree
I felt so salty free
I felt so salty free
I felt nothing like me
I felt so salty free
All your dreams will come true
All my dreams came true
But now, I have a bunch of other dreams
Ta-dum-dum
It's gotta be hot, hot

I felt so s-a-lty freeEmbed
