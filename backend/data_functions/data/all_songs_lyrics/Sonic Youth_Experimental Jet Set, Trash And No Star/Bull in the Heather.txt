Bull in the Heather Lyrics10, 20, 30, 40
Tell me that you wanna hold me
Tell me that you wanna bore me
Tell me that you gotta show me
Tell me that you need to slowly
Tell me that you're burning for me
Tell me that you can't afford me
Time to tell your dirty story
Time turning over and over
Time turning four leaf clover
Betting on the bull in the heather
10, 20, 30, 40
Tell me that you wanna scold me
Tell me that you adore me
Tell me that you're famous for me
Tell me that you're gonna score me
Tell me that you gotta show me
Tell me that you need to sorely
Time to tell your love story
Time turning over and over
Time turning four leaf clover
