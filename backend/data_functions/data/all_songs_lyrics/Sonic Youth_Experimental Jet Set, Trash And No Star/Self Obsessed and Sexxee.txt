Self Obsessed and Sexxee Lyrics
I remember when you first arrived
Magic marker on your belly button alright, alright
I read what you said you said drop dead oh no, oh no
I need you now 'cause I know you got nowhere to go

Schizo-action baby, create a scene
I'm the type-a-guy to boost your self-esteem
We party all night because it's you, you, you everyday
Self obsessed and sexy all the way

I remember your bloody trail to the top, the top
Took it all too far now you just can't stop, don't stop
I'll help collect your soul from the lost and found, it's around
And I will build you up while they put you down

Schizo-action baby, create a scene
I'm the type-a-guy to boost your self-esteem
We party all night because it's you, you, you everyday
Self obsessed and sexy all the way
All the way

Party party party, party all the time
Party party party, party all the time
Party party party, party all the time
Party party party, party all the timeEmbed
