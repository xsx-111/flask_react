Starfield Road LyricsThe turbo goes to rocket put your kiss in my hand
Sensate your belly down
Bend down round this garbage can
Pow, pound down, dirty starfield road
A hot ham slap it muscle skin jam load
Blam bam adds explosion to the lamb
Jesus is screaming your name
Violent loving, yeah
Kissing golden
We're going insane
But where is the shame?
When the star pet
Is to blame
Aah! You butt cheeks can't stay
As I spleen my name
In flameEmbed
