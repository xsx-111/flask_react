Skink Lyrics
Here, there
Here, there
Down to the bottom, around on the bottom we go
Here, there
Here, there
Down to the bottom and oh what a bottom it is

Yeah so?
Uh-oh
Let it go

Here, there
Here, there
Down to the bottom, around on the bottom we go
Here, there
Here, there
Down to the bottom and oh what a bottom it is

Uh-oh
Yeah so?
Let me go
Kiss beyond, kiss beyond the lips
Kiss beyond, kiss beyond my lips
Ooh I love - you!
Ooh baby baby
Kinda crazy, kinda hazy, kinda messy too

Here, there
Here, there
Down to the bottom and oh what a bottom it is
Here, there
Here, there
Down to the bottom, around on the bottom we go
Yeah, baby

Oh, oh
You know
I love you soEmbed
