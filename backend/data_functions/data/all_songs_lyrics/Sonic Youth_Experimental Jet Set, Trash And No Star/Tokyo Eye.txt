Tokyo Eye Lyrics
Tokyo eye
Tokyo crying somewhere
Seeking inside
Supermen sighing nowhere
Seven to nine
Luck is around this sun bear
Fur in the night
Kansai woman goes out
Soak in the eye
Osaka crying for you
Ship in the light
Sing in the water sun dew
Ticket to die
Ticket to ride the junk star
Shielded in white
Kansai girl in black dew

Tokyo eye
Tokyo crying somewhere
Seeking inside
Supermen sighing nowhere
Soaking in my eye
Soaking in my eye grey leaf
She dig to cry
She dig to cry love funny
Fur in the eye
Kansai girl is kiss teen
Fun in the light
Crying away to sun bearEmbed
