In the Mind of the Bourgeois Reader LyricsSeaside lover gonna rock the boat
Gonna roll it up fat super dope
Yeah pass it around or stick it on a pin
Bougie lover with the bunny skin (?)
A plastic lady here's a glitter roll
Straight from my heart thru thy soul
Yeah I don't care about dirty hair
All praise due queen and yogi bear
So get back in the boat yeah
Vicarious pleasure in my brain
Fantastic life never the same
Identity come set it free
Come set me out to mystery
Mistery mind yeah
Silly rabbit Trix are for kids
Your carrot souffle's got me on the skids
But I don't care about dirty hair
Got a fuzzy finger miss bunny tail
Hip hop till you drop yeah
Hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hopEmbed
