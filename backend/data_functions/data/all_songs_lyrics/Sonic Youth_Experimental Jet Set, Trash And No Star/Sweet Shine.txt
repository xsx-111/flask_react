Sweet Shine Lyrics
I hear my angel mounted baby
Pretend to everlast a lady
Marlboro belt unbuckled baby
They told me you were just crazy
I feel that I could burst
Gimme a little drink of your sweet time
Is it the way you think?
Or just a pattern of your glory
Is it just some story?
You wrote all for me
Do you think your my home?
Down deep your just a little whore
I know you, I'm from you
I know you, I'm from you

Whoooooow
I'm coming home to Swall Drive

Cowboys are languishing
Little girls are bees
Is it really a green stage coach
Crawling up to me
I dreamt that you were my vacation
Woke to find desire and dislocation
You're always heavy in rotation
Coming on, flirting with the nation
I feel that I could burst
Gimme a little drink of your sweet shine
Why is the way you grew
Still in the soul wanting you
Smelling the night jasmine
Hypnotizes me
The flower tells me stories
That make me sick and free
I know you, I'm from you
I know you, I'm from you


Alice is a chain store
Down past 1st and Vine
You can shop there anytime
It's all very fine
Look his hair is colored, do you think he grows
Look it's changing colors, it's bigger than a hose (?)
Look it's changing colors, it's bigger than a rose (?)
Look it's changing colors, it's bigger than a pose (?)
Look it's changing colors, it's bigger than a hose (?)
Look it's changing2Embed
