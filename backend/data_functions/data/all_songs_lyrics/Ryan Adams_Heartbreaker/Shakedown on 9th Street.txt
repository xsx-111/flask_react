Shakedown on 9th Street Lyrics
Head on down to 9th Street, gal
Lets go out kicking with the boys and the gals
Wear your dress and bring my ring
Someone's gonna get it, ain't gonna be me

Lucy, Lucy my gal
Lucy, Lucy my sweet
Lucy, Lucy my gal
I was just gonna hit him, but I'm gonna kill him now

We all met about half-past three
Lucy, she was rocking by my kicking machine
Too many straights, and not enough grease
That's when Lucy got it in the chest I think

Lucy, Lucy my gal
Lucy, Lucy my sweet
Lucy, Lucy my gal
I was just gonna hit him, but I'm gonna kill him now

"They started fighting, I was screaming for him
Boots all dirty, sexy, and thin
Then on come the lights, from the straights in their cars
I was just a-laughing when I hit the floor"
Lucy, Lucy my gal
Lucy, Lucy my sweet
Lucy, Lucy my gal
I was just gonna hit him, but I'm gonna kill him nowEmbed
