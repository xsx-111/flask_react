In My Time of Need Lyrics
Will you comfort me, in my time of need?
Can you take away the pain of hurtful deeds?
'Cause when we need it most, there's no rain at all
And the dust just settles right there on the feed

Will you say to me, "A little rain's gonna come"
When the sky can't offer none to me?
'Cause I will comfort you when my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me

'Cause when the calm comes down
I take the truck on into town
And buy whatever we can't seem to grow
I work these hands to bleed, 'cause I got mouths to feed
And I got fifteen dollars hid above the stove

Will you say to me, "A little rain's gonna come"
When the sky can't offer none to me?
'Cause I will comfort  you when my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me

'Cause it ain't like it was, on back in those days
When everyone would offer up a hand
These old bones are worn
I've grown tiresome
I know my time is surely gonna come
Will you comfort me in my time of need?
Can you take away the pain of hurtful deeds?
'Cause I will comfort you when my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me

Lord, we married young, and stayed where we came from
And gave those children everything we had
Will you stay with me, in my time of need?
Though it seems we had such little time for us

Will you say to me, "A little rain's gonna come"
When the sky can't offer none to me?
'Cause I will comfort you when my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry meEmbed
