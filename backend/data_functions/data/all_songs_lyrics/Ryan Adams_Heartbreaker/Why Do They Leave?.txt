Why Do They Leave? Lyrics
Oh, why do they leave?
Oh, why do they leave?
On the day that you needed them the most

Simple cards and things
Rose-colored sunsets, no flowers for me
Simple cards and things
Rose-colored sunsets, no flowers for me
Lover, why do you leave?
Lover, why do you leave?
On the day I want you for me?

Say, say it ain't so
That he will take you tomorrow
And I will sit here today the worst

Simple cards and things
Rose-colored sunsets, no flowers for me
Simple cards and things
Rose-colored sunsets, curtains for me
Lover, why do you leave?
Lover, why do you leave?
On the day I want you to be the one?Embed
