Call Me on Your Way Back Home Lyrics
Oh, baby, why do I miss you like I do?
Oh, I miss my sweet
And the birds all singing blue and white
And white

Call me on your way back home, dear
'Cause I miss you
Honey I ain't nothing new

Oh, baby, why did I treat you like I did?
Honey, I was just a kid
Bubblegum on my shoe
But you loved me, and I loved you

Call me on your way back home, dear
'Cause I miss you

And I just wanna die without you
Oh, I just wanna die without you
Yeah, I just wanna die without you
Without you
Honey, I ain't nothing new2Embed
