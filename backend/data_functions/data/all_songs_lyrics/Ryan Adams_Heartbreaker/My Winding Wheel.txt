My Winding Wheel Lyrics
Well, nighttime let her through
Yeah I'm talking to you, I wanna see her
Precious little thing
With eyes that dance around without their clothes

So buy a pretty dress
Wear it out tonight
For anyone you think could outdo me
Or better still be my winding wheel

'Cause I feel just like a map
Without a single place to go of interest
And I'm further North than South
If I could shut my mouth she'd probably like this

So buy a pretty dress
And wear it out tonight
For all the boys you think could outdo me
Or better still be my winding wheel
Be my winding wheel

Well the children laugh and sing
A song that ushers in her driving rain
And I'm standing in the station
Like some old record waiting on a train
So buy a pretty dress
Wear it out tonight
For anyone you think could outdo me
Or better still be my winding wheel
Be my winding wheel
Be my winding wheel1Embed
