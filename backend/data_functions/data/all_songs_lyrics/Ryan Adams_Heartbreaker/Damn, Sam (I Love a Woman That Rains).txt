Damn, Sam (I Love a Woman That Rains) Lyrics
As a man, I ain't never been much for sunny days
I'm as calm as a fruit stand in New York, and maybe as strange
But when the colors go out of my eyes, it's usually the change
But damn, Sam, I love a woman that rains

Clear as a bell and sound as an old engineer
Clear as a bell and sound as an old engineer
With talented breezes that blow off your hat with a sneer

As a man, I ain't never been much for talking to
I'm as open as the door in her house that leads to her room
And when the colour goes out of my eyes, she's usually, too
But damn, Sam, I love a woman that's blue

As a man, I ain't never been much for sunny days
I'm as calm as a fruit stand in New York, and maybe as strange
But when the colors go out of my eyes, it's usually the change
But damn, Sam, I love a woman that rains1Embed
