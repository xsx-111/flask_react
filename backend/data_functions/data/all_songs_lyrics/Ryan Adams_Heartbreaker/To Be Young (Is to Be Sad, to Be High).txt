To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, to Be High) Lyrics
Young boy, done me bad, I went and did you wrong
Young boy, done me bad, I went and did you wrong
And I got high, Lord, I got high
And I got a bone to pick with you
And I'm sure you know its true

Oh, one day when you're looking back
You were young, and man, you were sad
When you're young, you get sad
When you're young, you get sad, then you get high
Oh, man

Young gal, done you bad, and I went and did you wrong
Young gal, you done me bad, so I went and did you wrong
And I got high, Lord, I got high
Now you got a bone to pick with me
But I wish you'd let me be

Oh, one day when you're looking back
You were young, and man, you were sad
When you're young, you get sad
When you're young, you get sad, then you get high
You get high
Ooh, the days the rain would fall your way
Ooh, the days the rain would fall your way

Then you'd be high, 'cause you got sad
'Cause you got sad
Oh, man
Oh, man
Oh, man
Oh, man2Embed
