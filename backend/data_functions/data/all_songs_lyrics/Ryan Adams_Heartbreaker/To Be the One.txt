To Be the One Lyrics
Well the pills I got, they ask me, "Let's go out for a while"
And the knives up in the kitchen are all too dull to smile
Yeah, and the sun, it tries to warn me
"Boy, those wings are made of wax"
While the things I do to kill me
They just tell me to relax
But, oh, Cinderella
All dressed up in all your boots and all your charms
I'm not the fellow
To protect you or to keep you from all your harm

And I don't know which is worse
To wake up and see the sun
Or to be the one, be the one that's gone

And the empty bottle, it misses you
Yeah, and I'm the one that it's talking to
And with you and I just barely strangers
I'm pretty much just left a fool
Damn, don't the streets feel empty, though?
Just wandering 'round here without you
Oh, the empty bottle, it misses you
And I'm the one it's talking to
And I don't know which is worse
To wake up and see the sun
Or to be the one, be the one that's goneEmbed
