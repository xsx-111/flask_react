Move On Up (Live) LyricsHush now child, and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you, by and by
Just move on up
Towards your destination
You may find, from time to time, complications
Bite your lip, oh child, just take a trip
Though there may be a wet road ahead
You cannot slip, now
Just move on up
And keep on pushing
Just a little faith, you can put your mind to it
You can surely do it
Hush now child, and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you, by and by
Just move on up
Move on up!Embed
