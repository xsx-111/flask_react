Internationalists LyricsIf you believe you have an equal share
In the whole wide world and all it bears
An' that your share is no less or more than
Your fellow sisters and brother man
Then take this knowledge and with it insist
Declare yourself - an internationalist!
If you lay no blame at the feet of next door
An' realise this struggle is also yours
An' that without the strength of us altogether
The world as it stands will remain forever
Then take this challenge and make it exist!
Rise up as - an internationalist!
If your eyes see deeper than the colour of skin
Then you must also see we are the same within
An' the rights you expect are the rights of all
Now it's up to you to lead the call
That liberty must come at the top of the list
Stand proud as - an internationalist!
If you see the mistake in having bosses at all
You will also see how they all must fall
For under this system there is no such thing
As the Democracy our leaders would have us sing
No time for lies now as only truth must persist
Rise up now and declare yourself - an internationalist!Embed
