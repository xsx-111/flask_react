(When You) Call Me LyricsI know you have time
But believe me it will fly by -
And if it don't treat you right
I want you to know that you can call me
Into each life, some rain must fall
But if the storm becomes too much for you all -
Don't be afraid to enter my life
I will be there when you call me
Don't let your pride get in the way of your view
Of how we used to be -
Oh, to you it's long ago, but to me, yesterday
The passing of time is like the crashing of waves
It wears down on your memory and you can forget
That if it all gets too much I will always be there
For you to call me - if you need to call me
Into each life, some rain must fall
But when the storm becomes too much for you all -
Don't be ashamed to enter my life
I will be there when you call meEmbed
