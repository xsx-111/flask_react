The Whole Point II LyricsThe harbour lights that shine before me
The jewels that gleam from a beckoning sea
The rising shrieks that come from below me
The rushing winds of age and time
To close my eyes and feel the fall
To not resist unto the pull
Oh it's easy
So, so easy
The tiny scent that breezes past me
The promise that all could be mine
Just lose myself and make it easy
But I'm not prepared to live the lie
To shut my mouth and just say yes
To make a vow and then confess
It's too easy
Much too easy
All the power that I possess
My faith alone shall stand the test
To live my life as I see best
Without dark glasses a rose is picked
It's not easy
Not so easyEmbed
