Luck LyricsLuck fell in the right place for me
The day you happend to come by -
You caught me feeling all was useless
And left me feeling ten feet high
Now nothing again will be quite the same
You gathered my fears and threw them away
Luck dropped in just at the right time
The time when I felt most alone -
All my dreams had seemed to vanish
Now my nightmares have upped and gone
I'm not scared of farewells, nothing's the same twice
I stride through the day and I float through the night
How much choice do we have in this?
Like some almighty hand smashing your life into pieces
One day you're washed and drowned -
And the next minute you're put back on land
Now nothing again can be quite the same
I gather my fears and I throw them away
Luck - when you hold me closely
Ooh - feels like summertime
Luck - when you hold my hand
I - want it all the time
Luck - in your country kisses
Ooh - I love your outlook
Luck - in your hills and valleys
Go on talking my babbling brook!Embed
