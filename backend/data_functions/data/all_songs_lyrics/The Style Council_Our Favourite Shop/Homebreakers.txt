Homebreakers LyricsGood morning day, how do you do
I wonder - what will you do for me?
I should be on my way, I should be earning pay
I should be all the things that I'm not -
And I've tried on my own, now there's nothing to keep me at home
Like my Brother has too - gotta leave to get out of this view
You see they, tell you to move around -
If you can't find work in your own town
As I rise from my bed I can hear the old man
Blaming Heaven and Mother for this
30 Years with one firm, 13 months redundant
Yes I'd say that's unlucky for some -
Now our tears fall like rain, as my Mother walks me to my train
With a kiss and a wave - "Come home weekends" - that's if I can save
I swear I'll take it out on the man -
Who ever devised this economy plan
All the love in the world - can't put -
Dinner on the table -
All the hate that I feel no love could put right
Good morning day, how do you do
I wonder - what will you do for me?
I should be on my way, I should be earning pay
I should be all the things that I'm not -
And I've tried on my own, now there's nothing to keep me at home
All the love and the strength has been taken by this Government
You see they, tell you to move around -
If you can't find work in your own town
Father's in the kitchen, counting out coins
Mother's in the bedroom, looking through pictures of her boys
One is in London, looking for a job
The other's in Whitehall - Looking for those responsible!Embed
