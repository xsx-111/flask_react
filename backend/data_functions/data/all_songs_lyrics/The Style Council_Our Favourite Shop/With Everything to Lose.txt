With Everything to Lose LyricsFrom the playground to the wasteground
Hope ends at 17 -
Sweeping floors and filling shelves
Forced into government schemes -
11 years spent to dig out ditches
Forget your schoolday dreams -
Guarantees and lie-filled speeches
But nothing's what it seems -
Qualified and patronised
And with everything to lose
Oooh ooh
No choice or chance for the future
The rich enjoy less tax -
Dress the girls in pretty pink
The shit goes to the blacks
A generation's heart torn out
And covered up the facts
The only thing they'll understand
Is a wall against their backs
The only hope now left for those
With everything to lose
With everything to lose
With everything to lose
Oooh ooh
In desperation empty eyes
Signed up and thrown away -
There's drugs replacing dignity
The short sharp shock repaid -
There'll be no money if you dare to question
Working the Tory way -
The truth is up there carved in stone
Where 21 dead now lay -
A family's loss for a few pounds saved
With everything to lose
With everything to lose
With everything to lose
With everything to lose
With everything to lose
OoohEmbed
