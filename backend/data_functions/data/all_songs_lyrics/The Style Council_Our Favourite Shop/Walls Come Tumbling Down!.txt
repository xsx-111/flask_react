Walls Come Tumbling Down! LyricsPaul Weller:
You don't have to take this crap
You don't have to sit back and relax
Dee C. Lee:
(You can actually try changing it)
Paul Weller:
I know we've always been taught to rely
Upon those in authority
But you never know until you try
How things just might be
Dee C. Lee:
(If we came together so strongly, yeah)
Paul Weller:
Are you gonna try to make this work
Or spend your days down in the dirt
You see things can change
Yes an' walls came a-tumbling down

Dee C. Lee:
(Governments crack and systems fall
'Cause unity is powerful)
Paul Weller:
Lights go out
Walls come tumbling down
Dee C. Lee:
Yes, they do
(Yes, they do)
Yes, they do
(Yes, they do)
Paul Weller:
The competition is a colour TV
We're on "still pause" with the video machine
Dee C. Lee:
(That keep you slaves to the H.P., yeah)
Paul Weller:
Until the unity is threatened by
Those who have and who have not
Those who are with and those who are without
And dangle jobs like a donkey's carrot
Dee C. Lee:
(Until you don't know where you are)
Paul Weller:
Are you gonna get to realize
The class war's real, not mythologized
And like Jericho
Yes, the walls came a-tumbling down
(Governments crack and systems fall)
('Cause unity is powerful)
Lights go out
Walls come tumbling
(Down) You'll be too weak to fight it
(Down) Oh, less united
(Down) Oh, will you deny it?
(Ooh, Ooh, Oooooh....)
Paul Weller:
Are you gonna be threatened by
The public enemy is  Number 10
Those who play the power game
They take the profits, you take the blame
(When they tell you there's no rise in pay)
Paul Weller:
Are you gonna try to make this work
Or spend your days down in the dirt
You see things can change
Walls came a-tumbling down
(Governments crack and systems fall)
('Cause unity is powerful)
Lights go out
Walls come tumbling down
(Governments crack and systems fall) Yes, they do
('Cause unity is powerful)
Lights go out
Walls come tumbling down
(Governments crack and systems fall)
('Cause unity is powerful)
Lights go out
Walls come tumbling down
(Governments crack and systems fall)
('Cause unity is powerful)
Oh, lights go out
Walls come tumbling downEmbed
