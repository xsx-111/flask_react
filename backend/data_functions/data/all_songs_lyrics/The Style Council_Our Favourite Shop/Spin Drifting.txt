Spin Drifting LyricsI was hoping to be found alive in a pool of lies and
An ocean of tears
I was looking for a ship ahoy
I was waiting, bottom line, for a miracle
All I hope is that when they find me
I have the good sense to say a prayer
For all that is dear to me
I hope I still find them waiting there
Knowing that I should be grateful is not enough and no reason at all
It's only right to reveal my feelings
And even at times the best get bored
I was floating for quite a while with my fingers resting
In the deep blue sea
I was watching the spin drift dancing
Flowin' away to forever from me
I could have stayed forever and Sunday
Waiting for something or even someone
I could've watched the whole world pass me
Just for the sake of being reasonable
I was hoping to be found alive in a pool of lies and
An ocean of tears
I was looking for a ship ahoy
I was waiting, bottom line, for a miracle
All I hope is that when they find me
I have the good sense to say a prayer
For all that is dear to me
I hope I still find them waiting there
Knowing that I should be grateful is not enough or a reason at all
It's only right to reveal my feelings
And even at times the best get bored
I couldn have stayed forever and Sunday
Waiting for something or even someone
I could've watched the whole world pass me
Just for the sake of being reasonableEmbed
