A Casual Affair LyricsIt's funny how time seems to soften the blow
And only with time do I see at all
That the promises made were the start of the fall
The biggest mistake was to promise at all
Shout the odds
And what does it matter now?
That dreams are a passing cloud
Their place is taken
With many more fools like us
The time that we had we now have to repay
The sweet things we ate now leave a bitter taste
Can you ever remember a night or a day
You ever regretted eating that way
Say I'm wrong
But inside you know I'm right
And useless to try and fight
They say it was worth it
But you know it never was
The hurt inside
And all the wasted tears we've cried
Oh, the fun we had
All the good things just turned bad
Oh, the memories
Rearrange themselves to misery for me
Say I'm wrong
But inside you know I'm right
And useless to try and fight
They say it was worth it
But you know it never was
The hurt inside
And all the wasted tears we've cried
Oh, the fun we had
All the good things just turned bad
Oh, the memories
Rearrange themselves to misery for me
A casual affair in a casual way
We don't go far living from day to day
It just is a laugh that we left unnamed
You came here with pride but they told you was changed
Shout the odds
And what does it matter now?
That dreams are a passing cloud
Their place is taken
With many more fools like usEmbed
