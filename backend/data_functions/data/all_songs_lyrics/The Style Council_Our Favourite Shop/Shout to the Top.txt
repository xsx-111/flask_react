Shout to the Top LyricsI was half in mind, I was half in need
And as the rain came down, I dropped to my knees and I prayed
I said, oh, heavenly thing, please cleanse my soul
I've seen all on offer and I'm not impressed at all
I was halfway home, I was half insane
And every shop window I looked in just looked the same
I said now send me a sign to save my life
Cause at this moment in time there's nothing certain
In these days of mine
Y'see, it's a frightening thing when it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked I might as well stay
And promise myself each and every day
That when you're knocked on your back and your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else but
To shout to the top
Whoa, we're gonna shout to the top
We're gonna shout to the top
Mm, we're gonna shout to the top
Oh, we're gonna shout to the top
Y'see, it's a frightening thing when it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked I might as well stay
And promise myself each and every day
Oh, when you shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
Mm, we're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
Mm, we're gonna shout to the top, shout
So when you're knocked on your back and your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else
But to shout to the top, shout
Whoa, we're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
Mm, we're gonna shout to the top, shout
So when you're knocked on your back and your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else but
To shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
Mm, we're gonna shout to the top, shout
Shout (shout to the top, shout)
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top)
(Shout to the top)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top)
(Shout to the top)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)Embed
