Mars Attacks LyricsFind yourself alone and in a room
In the dark is where you will be soon
Only safe for you to go to the light
You won't go alone without a fight
They'll be there waiting, anticipating
They'll be there by your side
From them you cannot hide
No need to press rewind
You won't miss out this time
I'll put behind your ears
Something to calm your fears
The scariest day you knew it will come soon
Don't try to hide, there's nothing you can do
In the night they travel to and from your house
Don't sleep alone they're not here for your stuff
They'll be there waiting, anticipating
They'll be there by your side
From them you cannot hide
No need to press rewind
You won't miss out this time
I'll put behind your ears
Something to calm your fears
I do this for my culture
To let them know what a Martian looks like
When a Martian's on a poster
Take me to your dealer
Take me to her supplier
Take me straight to the reefer
Then take me back to the fire
Either that or bring it to me
But either way I'm gonna need at least
About 5000 doobies and
Doing donuts in the drop tops
Mel Gibson in the kitchen, tryina chop my fingers off
It's day, it's night
It's dark, it's light
No time to hide ( Imma tall white...)
They come tonight ( Lookin for some...)
It's day, it's night
It's dark, it's light ( Tall white widows)
No time to hide
They come tonight
It's day, it's night
It's dark, it's light ( An I'm a little green man...)
No time to hide
They come tonight ( Lookin for a...)
It's day, it's night
It's dark, it's light ( little green ma'am)
No time to hide
They come tonight
It's day, it's night
It's dark, it's light
No time to hide
They come tonightEmbed
