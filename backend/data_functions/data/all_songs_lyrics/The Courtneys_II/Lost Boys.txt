Lost Boys LyricsTake me on a motorcycle
Flying down the highway we go
Headin' in the wrong direction
Pale skin no reflection
And you’ll never grow old and you’ll never die
And that just makes me want to cry
Little sister
Little sister
That just makes me want to cry
It's hard to find that simple piece of mind
You want it its not there
And there’s someone standing out my window
It's hard to find that simple piece of mind
You want it its not there
And there’s someone standing out my window
You look just like you did in 1986
And that’s why you're
Vampire teenage boyfriend
