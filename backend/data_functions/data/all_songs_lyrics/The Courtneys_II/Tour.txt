Tour LyricsHere it comes
You won't look back
You wanna stay
Don't budge
It's in your heart
You'll find a way
You'll find a way

What you are and what you wanna be
Takes a long, long, long, long time
It takes a long time
What you are and what you wanna see
Takes a long, long, long, long time
It takes a long time
And I don't wanna be alone
It's time for us to let go
Slack off and hit the open road
Drivin' down the western sea
The sun it gets higher, higher
It's time for us to let go
Slack off and hit the open road
Drivin' down the western sea
The sun it gets higher, higher
What you have and what you want the most
Takes a long, long, long, long time
It takes a long time
Who you have and what you want so close
Takes a long, long, long, long time
It takes a long time
And I don't wanna be alone
It's time for us to let go
Slack off and hit the open road
Drivin' down the western sea
The sun it gets higher, higher
It's time for us to let go
Slack off and hit the open road
Drivin' down the western sea
The sun it gets higher, higher
Here it comes
You won't look back
You wanna stay
Don't budge
It's in your heart
You'll find a way
You'll find a wayEmbed
