Virgo LyricsBaby you're not around
Sometimes I get alone here
Baby you're all I want
Sometimes I get a cold fear
And my mind's in a sea
Sail out
Like I just don't care
Free for a moment
Say you believe
Stand proud
Like I just don't care
Free for a moment
Baby I turn you on
My day feels like their more
Baby when you are near
I lose all of my free time

And my mind's in a sea
Sail out
Like I just don't care
Free for a moment
Say you believe
Stand proud
Like I just don't care
Free for a moment
I need to know right now
What I did before you came around
I need to know right now
What I did before you came around
My mind's in a sea
Sail out
Like I just don't care
Free for a moment
Say you believe
Stand proud
Like I just don't care
Free for a momentEmbed
