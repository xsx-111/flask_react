Country Song LyricsAnother morning and I know I just can't stay
It's just there's something of an ocean in the way
I pick my head up off the ground again
I know I'm going but I don't know when
And I wake up in the afternoon
Late to bed I woke too soon
This is not the place I need
But for now it's what I'll lead
Wake up in the afternoon
Late to bed I woke too soon
This is not the place I need
But for now it's what I'll lead
She told me that it's time I listen to my heart
It's what I have to do before I fall apart
I don't know what it is I seek from you
I always need to know that you approve
And I wake up in the afternoon
Late to bed I woke too soon
This is not the place I need
But for now it's what I'll lead
Wake up in the afternoon
Late to bed I woke too soon
This is not the place I need
But for now it's what I'll leadEmbed
