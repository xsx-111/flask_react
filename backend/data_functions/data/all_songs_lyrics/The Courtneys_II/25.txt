25 LyricsI spent all night trying to chase you
And that just got me nowhere
When I caught you I couldn't face you
And that just got me nowhere
Is it you I want
Or is it you I wanna be
What am I runnin' from
Runnin' from something
I don't know
But it's time to go
Why am I blinded by this
When is he gonna notice
Tried to sit myself beside you
And that just got me nowhere
Thought that I could try and hide you
And that just got me nowhere
Is it you I want
Or is it you I wanna be
What am I runnin' from
Runnin' from something
I don't know
But it's time to go
Why am I blinded by this
When is he gonna notice
And when six months pass
Will I have made it last
I doubt I would have tried
Cause I'm a Gemini
And I change my mind
Always change my mind

Why am I blinded by this
When is he gonna noticeEmbed
