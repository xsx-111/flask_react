Frankie LyricsFrankie
You're on mind
Nearly all of the time
But it's not that bad
And frankly
You're so far away
Nearly everyday
And it drives me mad
Frankie
You're on mind
Nearly all of the time
But it's not that bad
And frankly
You're so far away
Nearly everyday
And it drives me mad
You are the catalyst
You started all of this
I've gotta let it go
Why do I feel so low
And I want you to know
Yeah I want you to know
You're the one that stole the show
You came into my heart
I wanna be a part
I know that you can't see
What it is you do to me
I miss you everyday
So I gotta find a way
Frankie
You're on mind
Nearly all of the time
But it's not that bad
And frankly
You're so far away
Nearly everyday
And it drives me mad
You are the catalyst
You started all of this
I've gotta let it go
Why do I feel so low
And I want you to know
Yeah I want you to know
You're the one that stole the show
You came into my heart
I wanna be a part
I know that you can't see
What it is you do to me
I miss you everyday
So I gotta find a way
Frankie
You're on mind
Nearly all of the time
But it's not that bad
And frankly
You're so far away
Nearly everyday
And it drives me madEmbed
