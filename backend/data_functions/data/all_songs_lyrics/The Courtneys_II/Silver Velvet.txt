Silver Velvet Lyrics
The day is getting shady
Playing in the isle
There's nothing in this life to do
But stay here for a while
The day is getting shady
Playing in the isle
There's nothing in this life to do
But stay here for a while

And nothing you say and nothing you do
Can stop me from thinking about you
Doesn't matter if it's right
You're just the one I like
And nothing you say and nothing you do
Can stop me from thinking about you
Doesn't matter if it's right
You're just the one I like

Can't get you out of my head
Even through the miles
I know that it is wrong but you
Just seem to drive me wild
Can't get you out of my head
Even through the miles
I know that it is wrong but you
Just seem to drive me wild
And nothing you say and nothing you do
Can stop me from thinking about you
Doesn't matter if it's right
You're just the one I like
And nothing you say and nothing you do
Can stop me from thinking about you
Doesn't matter if it's right
You're just the one I like
And nothing you say and nothing you do
Can stop me from thinking about you
Doesn't matter if it's right
You're just the one I like
And nothing you say and nothing you do
Can stop me from thinking about you
Doesn't matter if it's right
You're just the one I likeEmbed
