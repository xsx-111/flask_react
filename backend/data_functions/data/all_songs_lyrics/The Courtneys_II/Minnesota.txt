Minnesota LyricsI'm back and forth
I'm up and down
I take my time I hit the ground
I just don't know what I'm to do
When I'm falling here for you
If you go away
I hope that you will know
That I'll miss, that I'll miss you so
Not easy to pretend it's
Not hard to let you go
So I'll see you in the winter snow
I'll see you in the winter snow
And you never did find your way
It's why you're leaving me today
And you didn't know what to do
Cause I've fallen here for you
If you go away
I hope that you will know
That I'll miss, that I'll miss you so
Not easy to pretend it's
Not hard to let you go
So I'll see you in the winter snow
I'll see you in the winter snow
And I never wanted you to go
But you had to
And I never wanted you to go
But you had to
It's a hard kinda thing to find
When you're losing all your mind
And you don't know how to talk
To those around you
It's a hard kinda thing to find
When you're losing all your mind
And you don't know how to talk
To those around youEmbed
