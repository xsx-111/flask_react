Iron Deficiency LyricsCan't have what you can't find
No motivation you're running out of time
You want the honey
You've got no money
Sit back and you think it's funny
You get the itch
And she's a bitch
She's a bad rash
It comes with the cash
And if you want it to go away
I would leave your job today
Was it iron deficiency
Didn't see what was coming at me
My hair is breaking
My body's shaking
In the mirror I look forsaken
Can't see what you don't know
No intuition like running through the snow
You want the honey
You've got no money
Sit back and you think it's funny
And in the face
What was it mace
A bit of gore when you walk out the door
And if you want it to go away
I would leave your home today
Was it iron deficiency
Didn't see what was coming at me
My hair is breaking
My body's shaking
In the mirror I look forsaken
In the blood that's in my veins
With a pill to ease the pain
In the blood that's in my veins
With a pill to ease the pain
In the blood that's in my veins (Take a few pills now)
With a pill to ease the pain
In the blood that's in my veins (See the future come)
With a pill to ease the pain
In the blood that's in my veins (Take a few pills, a few pills now)
With a pill to ease the pain
In the blood that's in my veins (See the future, the future come)
With a pill to ease the pain
Was it iron deficiency
Didn't see what was coming at me
My hair is breaking
My body's shaking
In the mirror I look forsakenEmbed
