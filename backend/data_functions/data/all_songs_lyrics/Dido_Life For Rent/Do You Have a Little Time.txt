Do You Have a Little Time Lyrics
If you are feeling low and lost today
You're probably doing too much again
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time?
Do you have a little time for me?
Slow down my love, you're confusing me
And if you're feeling stressed, just try calling
You spend your time waiting for anyone to see
Do you have a little time?
Do you have a little time for me?

If you should stop for a while
You'll find me standing by
Over here at the side of your life
I'd like to hold you still
Remind you of what you've missed
If you have a little time
If you have a little time, that is

Why do you still run when you could walk with me?
Life will pass you by when you move this quickly
Why can you see when you're spinning around?
Do you have a little time?
Do you have a little time for me?

If you let me listen I'll make you feel clear
You spend your time waiting for anyone to say
