Stoned Lyrics
When you're stoned, baby, and I am drunk
And we make love, it seems a little desolate
It's hard sometimes not to look away
And think what's the point when I'm having to hold this fire down
I think I'll explode if I can't feel this free now

If you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead, you will be missing me when I go
Cause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold

When I feel loved, baby, I join the road
And the world moves with me
When I feel lost I just slip away
Silently, quietly take my things and go
And think what's the point, think where's the hope we're coming home

Cause if you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead, you will be missing me when I go
Cause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold
And if you find one day
Find some freedom and relief
With this freedom maybe
Maybe you will find some peace
And with this peace baby
I hope it brings you back to me
Bring you home, take me home

Cause if you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead, you will be missing me when I go
Cause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold

Oh, take me home
Oh, take me home
When you're stoned, baby, take me home
