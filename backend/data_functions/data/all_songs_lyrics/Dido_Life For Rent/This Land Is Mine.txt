This Land Is Mine Lyrics
From behind these walls I hear your song, oh sweet words
The music that you play lights up my world
The sweetest that I've heard
Could it be that I've been touched and turned? Oh Lord, please
Finally, finally things are changing

This land is mine but I'll let you rule
I'll let you navigate and demand
Just as long as you know, this land is mine
So find your home and settle in
Oh, I'm ready to let you in
Just as long as we know, this land is mine

After all the battles and the wars, the scars and loss
Well, I'm still the queen of my domain
And feeling stronger now
The walls are down a little more each day, since you came
Finally, finally things are changing


Follow the days I've traveled alone
In this cold and colorless place till now
It's what I had to pay

This land is mine but I'll let you rule
I'll let you navigate and demand
Just as long as you know, this land is mineEmbed
