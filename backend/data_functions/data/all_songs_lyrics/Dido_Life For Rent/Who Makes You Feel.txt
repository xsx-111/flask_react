Who Makes You Feel Lyrics
I don't touch you the way I used to
And I don't call and write when I'm away
We don't make love as often as we did do
What couldn't wait now waits and usually goes away

But listen and think when I say
Oh, but listen and think when I say

Who makes you feel the way I make you feel?
Who loves you and knows you the way I do?
Who touches you and holds you quite like I do?
Who makes you feel like I make you feel?

I don't mind if you come home late
And I don't ever ask you where you've been
I just assume if there's a problem, you'd tell me

But listen and think when I say
Oh, but listen and think when I say

Who makes you feel the way I make you feel?
Who loves you and knows you the way I do?
Who touches you and holds you quite like I do?
Who makes you feel like I make you feel?
Who makes you feel like I make you feel?
Who makes you feel like I make you feel?

Being weak, when I am strong
Being seen for who you are
Being sad and lost but not alone

But listen and think when I say
Oh, but listen and think when I say

Who makes you feel the way I make you feel?
Who loves you and knows you the way I do?
Who touches you and holds you quite like I do?
Who makes you feel like I make you feel?
Who makes you feel the way I make you feel?
Who loves you and knows you the way I do?
Who touches you and holds you quite like I do?
Who makes you feel like I make you feel?

Who makes you feel like I make you feel?
Who makes you feel like I make you feel?
Who makes you feel like I make you feel?Embed
