Crawling With Idiot LyricsIt's crawling with idiots
I'm itchin' to leave
I'm soft with fatigue, I need somethin'
I've never seen anything quite like you
In here

Come on, it's not serious
I just need arms tonight
You're blue collar pride
And you're loose cotton cool
You're wiltin' a little
Nothing grows down here
Chrome smoke heat me and you

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, just tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, just tonight
TonightEmbed
