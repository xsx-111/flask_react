Not a Job LyricsPull the final splinters
Of missing picture winters
You have to give yourself a break
What's the fascination
With lovers at the station
You have to tear yourself away

The dream again nobody understands
Walking through the long grass on your hands
It's not a job to do today
Sleep it off
Words to make her stay: you said
Leave me and the plants die
A panic smile across your face
Corrugated browline
The hissing bitter punchline
Call when you can tie your lace

You rule my world my brother
You rule my world compadre
