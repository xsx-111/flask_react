Buttons and Zips LyricsAl had the guile and the sideways smile
Bad boy and god
Beck knew how to push a boy to blush
Known as The Fox
Tom came out in June to a crowded room
No one was shocked
Ed, Ed had the hair, the blues and the shoes
Got me arrested once

"Will I ever get this song off my lips" is what you said
We were at each other's buttons and zips
In the blossom shed
Joe wanted to go before he could
Joe's doing good
Cath, Cath was my all and every day
She married in May

"Will I ever get this song off my lips" is what you said
We were at each other's buttons and zips
In each other's bedEmbed
