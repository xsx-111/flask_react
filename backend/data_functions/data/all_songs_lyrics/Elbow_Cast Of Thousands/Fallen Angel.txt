Fallen Angel Lyrics
All the fallen angels
Roostin' in this place
Count back the weeks on worried fingers
Virgin mother what's-her-face

You don't need to sleep alone
You bring the house down
Choose your favorite shoes
And put your blues on cruise control

All the gelded mongrels
Bear their teeth for you
Drag your feathers 'cross the dance floor
Throw your shapes electric blue

You don't need to sleep alone
You bring the house down
Choose your favorite shoes
And keep your blues on cruise control

Don't fall to pieces on me
Don't fall to pieces on me
You don't need to sleep alone
You bring the house down
Choose your favorite shoes
And keep your blues on cruise controlEmbed
