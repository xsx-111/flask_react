Ribcage LyricsWe blew the doors didn't we?
Pissed in their champagne
And did a real thing didn't we?
Gave ourselves a name
And peeled away the shame
I wanted to explode
To pull my ribs apart
And let the sun inside (x2)
Red stain blossoms
And all you have is kisses
All you have is kisses (x2)
And when the sunshine
Throwin' me a lifeline
Finds it's way into my room
All I need is you
We blew the doors didn't we?
Pissed in their champagne
And did a real thing didn't we?
To pull my ribs apart
And let the sun inside (x2)
Red stain blossoms
And all you have is kisses
All you have is kisses (x2)
We called that love (x3)
We called that love (x3)
And when the sunshine
Throwin' me a lifeline
Finds it's way into my room
All I need is you (x6)
All I need is you
All you have is kisses
And all I need is youEmbed
