House with No Door Lyrics
There's a house with no door, I'm living there
At nights it gets cold and the days are hard to bear inside
There's a house with no roof, so the rain creeps in
Falling through my head as I try to think out time

I don't know you, you say you know me
That may be so, there's so much that I am unsure of
You call my name, but it sounds unreal, I forget how I feel
My body's rejecting the cure

There's a house with no bell but then nobody calls
I sometimes find it hard to tell if any are alive at all outside
There's a house with no sound; yes, it's quiet there
There's not much point in words if there's no-one to share in time

I've learned my lines, I know them so well
I am ready to tell whoever will finally come in
Of the line in my mind that's cold in the night
It doesn't seem right when there's that little dark figure running
Won't somebody help me?

There's a house with no door and there's no living there
One day it became a wall, well I didn't really care at the time
There's a house with no light, all the windows are sealed
Overtaxed and strained â€“ now nothing is revealed but time

I don't know you, you say you know me
That may be so, there's so much that I am unsure of
You call my name, but it sounds unreal, I forget how I feel
My body's rejecting the cure
Won't somebody help me?
