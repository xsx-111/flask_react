Lost LyricsA.) The Dance in Sand and Sea
So here we are, or rather, here am I, quite alone
I'm seeing things that were shared before, long ago
My memory stretches and I am dazed, you know I know
How good the time was and how I laughed
Times have changed, now you're far away, I can't complain
I had all my chances but they slipped right through my hands
Like so much sand
I know I'll never dance like I used to
I'll just wait till day breaks upon the land and the sea
Hoping that I can catch all of the memories
Then I must crawl off upon my way, all of me
Listening hard for the final words
But there are none, the sunrise calls, I've lingered on
Too close for comfort and I don't know quite why
I feel like crying
I know we'll never dance like we used to
I look up, I'm almost blinded
By the warmth of what's inside me
And the taste that's in my soul
But I'm dead inside as I stand alone
B.) The Dance in Frost
I wore my moods like different sets of clothes
But the right one was never around
And as you left I heard my body ring
And my mind began to howl
It was far too late to contemplate the meaning of it all
You know that I need you, but somehow
I don't think you see my love at all
At some point I lost you, I don't know quite how it was
The wonderland lay in a coat of white, chilling frost
I looked around and I found I was truly lost
Without your hand in mine I am dead
Reality is unreal and games I've tried just aren't the same
Without your smile there's just nowhere to hide
Yes, and deep inside
I know I've never cried as I'm about to
If I could just frame the words
That would make your fire burn
All this water that's now around me could be the love
That should surround me
Looking out through the tears that blind me
My heart bleeds that you may find me
Or at least that I can
Forget and be numb
But I, I just can't stop because the words still come
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love youEmbed
