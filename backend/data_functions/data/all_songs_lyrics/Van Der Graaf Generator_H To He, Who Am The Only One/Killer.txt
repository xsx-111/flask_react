Killer Lyrics
So you live in the bottom of the sea
And you kill all that come near you
But you are very lonely
Because all the other fish fear you
And you crave companionship
And someone to call your own
Because for the whole of your life
You've been living alone

On a black day in a black month
At the black bottom of the sea
Your mother gave birth to you
And died immediately
'Cos you can't have two killers
Living in the same pad
And when your mother knew that her time had come
She was really rather glad

Death in the sea, death in the sea
Somebody please come and help me, come and help me
Death in the sea, death in the sea
Somebody please come and help me, come and help me
Fishes can't fly, fishes can't fly
Fishes can't and neither can I, neither can I
Fishes can't fly, fishes can't fly
Fishes can't and neither can I, neither can I

Now I'm really rather like you
For I've killed all the love I ever had
By not doing all I ought to
And by leaving my mind coming bad
And I too am a killer
For emotion runs as deep as flesh
Yes, and I too am so lonely
And I wish that I could forget

We need love, we need love, we need love
We need love, we need love, we need love2Embed
