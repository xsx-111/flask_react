Expresso Noir LyricsCrushed in the corridor, swimming in smoke. Broken leg, aching head -
Tried polite conversation in braille. Broken French. Though my friend
Chews his garlic, he's dead from his head to his sandles. I tear at the
Handle and we came to a shuddering stop and we topple like dominoes
Swallowed the hot tide of bread crumbs and cheap wine... The cavalry dived
Into action with batons... knives... they gave me a fine, ripped the shirt
Off my back, threw my case on the tracks - saw it smashed to a fragmented
Mess by the midnight express from Atlantis. OO-OO. A manifestation of pure
Liquid light. Never stops at the stations, it flies overnight as we crawl
In a circle. The sinks overflow. All the windows are enclosed and the
Ape on my shoulder's overdosed. He rattles a can for some change then he
Rolls around, over in pain and wraps his legs around my ankles. I try to
Complain... All I want is a coffee and GET OFF THIS TRAIN! OO-OOEmbed
