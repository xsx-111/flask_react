Belladonna LyricsBelladonna
Sea blue marshmallow eyes
Belladonna sees you- it's just a disguise
She sees nothing but grey
Belladonna
Ice cool, shaken not stirred
Belladonna
Whisper only the word
She would wash the day away
And as I faded through the years
She found an answer to the tears
It wasn't wise
But no, no humble mortal
Ever matched those eyes
Belladonna
Pretty name for a slave
Belladonna
Starburst shouts from the grave
"I'll remember our dawn."
Belladonna
Pretty name for a slave
Belladonna
Starburst shouts from the grave
"I'll remember our dawn."Embed
