She hugged the sand; she cursed the storm for 16 days and no tomorrows
Mourning friends who fled and loves that died stillborn... A lifetime

Veil, behind the mask, behind the vizor... And somewhere spiteful spirits
Laughed at her - the last survivor. Because she'd always been alone, she'd
Always be aloneEmbed
