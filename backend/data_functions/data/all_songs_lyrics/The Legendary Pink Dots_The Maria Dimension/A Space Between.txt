A Space Between LyricsBilly was a car crash - all he ever knew was pain
Lived a milli-milli-milli-second; never born again
Though no one saw him coming, plenty witnessed his remains -
Laid a wreath yet they never knew him... Me? I'm just the rain
Laid poor Billy to eternal rest, eternal rust
I soaked the dust that covers him, I wait for all the others
They all have names...
Red Harry was a bright young spark that flew and burned old London Town
In '66. He flew to bits. He tore it down (bubonic bliss!)
And me? I'm just the kiss our maker blew to put him out
To eternal rest. Eternal rust. To dust, to ash. I cover up
And wait for all the others. We all have names...
Georgie was cut on Hitler's knee. He ran for weeks, turned shades of green...
They kidnapped me and made him clean... On Winter nights, I still hear him scream
I cover up. I wait for all the others
Jane? Her mother was a hurricane who swept the plains and sneezed away
A continent with me (the sea). The team that made a myth by hiding it
Became a hit on Broadway but it wasn't quite the same - they all FORGOT our names
We ALL have namesEmbed
