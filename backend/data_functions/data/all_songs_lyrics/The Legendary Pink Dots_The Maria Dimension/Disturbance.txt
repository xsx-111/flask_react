Disturbance LyricsWe ride on the avalanche we climb the melting red rungs
Of the ladder that leads high to a darkening moon
We're the watchers of disaster, we're the dancers on your tomb
We're the invisible invaders of your privacy... your dreams
We're the spectres on your screen. We murmur sweet transparent lunacy
On hot oppressive nights - you shine a light and you will see
Just a shadowEmbed
