Cheraderama LyricsColliding in the stroboscope...
Yes, now you see me, now you don't
Tonight I'm dressed in black, I mourn the death of colour
Hopeless, crying in my wine
Through happy hour; trace the lines
That crawl across my face and 'round my eyes
Watch the ballerinas fly
On powder clouds through six dimensions
Seeing just the patterns on the wall
Choose your masks and raise your armour
Eyes down for Cheraderama
Choose your masks and raise your armour
Eyes down for Cheraderama
Choose your masks and raise your armour
Eyes down for Cheraderama
Choose your masks and raise your armour
Eyes down for Cheraderama
Cold eyes searching for a space
That's warm enough to take them through the night
There's only black & white
Express
We never touch, we only press
Can taste the desperation in your breath
I swear that I'll protect you
If you'd only look into my eyes
Choose your masks and raise your armour
Eyes down for Cheraderama
Choose your masks and raise your armour
Eyes down for Cheraderama
Choose your masks and raise your armour
Eyes down for Cheraderama
Choose your masks and raise your armour
Eyes down for Cheraderama
Choose your masks and raise your armour
Eyes down for Cheraderama!Embed
