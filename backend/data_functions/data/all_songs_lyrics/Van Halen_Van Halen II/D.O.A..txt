D.O.A. LyricsWe was broke and hungry on a summer day
They sent the sheriff down to try and drive us away
We was sittin' ducks for the police man
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can
And I'm alone
I'm on the highway
Wanted dead or alive
Dead or alive
Broken down and dirty
Dressed in rags a from the day my mama told me
"Boy, you pack your bags."
Send the mayor down in his pickup truck
The jury look at me, say, "Outta luck."
And I'm alone
I'm on the highway
Wanted dead or alive
Dead or alive

Now, I'm broken down and dirty
Dressed in rags a from the day my mama told me
"Boy, you pack your bags."
We was sittin' ducks for the police man
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can
And I'm alone
I'm on the highway
Wanted dead or alive
Dead or alive
