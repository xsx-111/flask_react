Light Up the Sky LyricsYeah, we're all fast breakers comin' out of the gates
Takin' chances, we're the crash and burn
Yeah, there is a way with beauty, but you never gave a love
Across the line where none return
I watch my television, almost lost my mind
It said, "Open your eyes. Leave it all behind."
I heard the wind a whisperin', strong magic comin' on
They comin' on for sure
Come see your children; yeah, they're lighting up the skies
Won't recognize them anymore, haha
Wolves at my door, wised up quick
Turned here and gone from on the go
Seems the old folks who come up short
Were the pretty little kids who didn't want it, no
I had to pay admission when I came tonight
And it said, "Open my eyes. Leave it all behind."
I heard the wind a whisperin', strong magic comin' on
It's comin' on for sure
Come see your children; yeah, they're lighting up the skies
You won't recognize them anymore
Ooh, mama, see the firelight
Ooh, we're comin' out tonight
Ooh, mama, see the firelight
Ooh, lighting up the sky, light 'em up
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light 'em up1Embed
