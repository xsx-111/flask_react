Citizens Lyrics
Turn out the lights
Birdless skies
Throw me on the rope
Wound tight
Nervous fright
Darling, the killer you know

White lies, white lies
White lies, white lies

Women and men
Citizens
Carry your own cross
Careless
Careless
You are the albatross

White lies, white lies
White lies, white lies

Pine box
Stop the clocks
Why can't both be true?
High times
High crimes
Medals for you to salute
White lies, white lies
White lies, white lies
White lies, white lies
White lies, white lies
White lies, white lies
White lies, white lies
White lies, white liesEmbed
