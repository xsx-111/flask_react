Before Us Lyrics
I'm surprised, staring at the knives
Lying silent in the drawer
I hear the front door ring in my guitar
Empty up against the wall

Alone with the people who have come before
Alone with the people who have come before
Alone with the people who have come before us
I'm high for the people who have come before
I'm high for the people who have come before
I'm high for the people who have come before us

I remember when wars would end
Remember when wars would end?
Now‚ when something's dead
Now‚ when something's dead
We try to kill it again

Alone with the people who have come before
Alone with the people who have come before
Alone with the people who have come before usEmbed
