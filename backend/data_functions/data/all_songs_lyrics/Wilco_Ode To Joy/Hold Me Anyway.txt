Hold Me Anyway Lyrics
So you might not give a damn
I'm like a hologram
Light is all I am

Time is nothing I can keep
It's the same as when I sleep
If time is just to kill
Then I will

Overflowing like a crowd
And I'm freaking the fuck out
I'll try to do my best
I guess

High in an old dead tree
That plastic bag is me
That's where I want to be

Are we all in love, just because?

No, I think it's poetry and magic
Something too big to have a name
And when you get it right, it's still tragic
And when you die, who's to blame?
Did you think everything would be okay?

Are we all in love just because?

No, I think it's poetry and magic
Something too big to have a name
And when you get it right, it's still tragic
And when you die, who's to blame?
Did you think everything would be okay?


No, I think it's poetry and magic
Something too big to have a name
And when you get it right, it's still tragic
When you die, who's to blame?
Do you think everything will be okay?
