Quiet Amplifier LyricsI wish your world was mine
I wish your world was mine
Prayers run along the wires
Honey, no train's gonna come
I have waited my whole life
I've tried, in my way, to love everyone
I wish your world was mine
I wish your world was mine
I have a quiet amplifier
Silence seems more true
Every guitar is denied
I've tried, in my way, to love you
I wish your world was mine
I wish your world was mine
I wouldn't mind feelin' fine
I wish your world was mine
If only your world was mine
If only your world was mine
Shy little stars must shine
Shy little flower on the vineEmbed
