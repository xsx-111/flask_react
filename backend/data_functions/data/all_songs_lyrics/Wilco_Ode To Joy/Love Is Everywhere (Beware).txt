Love Is Everywhere (Beware) Lyrics
So tangled in the wild
Seeing  myself as something more mean
Out  in the country
Sadness wants me
Further away from the scene

With  right now, right now
Love  is everywhere
Right now, right now
Love  is everywhere

Where the sunlight grabs the lake
It's frozen in the flames
Beneath the sleeping town
With  the riots raining down
It's all yours now
It's all for you

Right now, right now
Love is everywhere
Right now, right now
Love is everywhere
So many things I do
I can't explain to you

Right now, right now
Love is everywhere
With right now, I'm frightened how
Love is here, beware

Our love is everywhereEmbed
