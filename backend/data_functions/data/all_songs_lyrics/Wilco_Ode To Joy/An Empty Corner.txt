An Empty Corner Lyrics
Eight tiny lines of cocaine
Left on a copy machine
In an empty corner of a dream
My sleep could not complete

There are sirens in the birds
And you and I are too far apart
And my eyes need a shave
What else can go wrong?

Now that I'm not longed for
Wild life seems wrong
Won't care
Won't stare
You've got family out there

The silver black boot
It cracked my front tooth
It's a new kind of truth
I'm getting used to

Come back lonely
How sad, if only
Don't believe you don't care
You've got family out there
Where the power lines are down
Whipping sparks around
Like angels touching down
I see you there

How sad, if only
Don't believe you don't care
You've got family out there
You've got family out thereEmbed
