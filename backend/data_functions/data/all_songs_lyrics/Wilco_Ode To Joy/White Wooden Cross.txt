White Wooden Cross LyricsA white, wooden cross by the side of the road
One  someone lost that I did not know
What  would I do?
What would I do?
If a white, wooden cross meant that I'd lost you
I  asked myself, "How would I let go?"
And  a thought appeared like a morning dew
And my blood ran cold
My  blood ran cold
As these sad ideas passed through
Tell me no lies
Tell me no lies
Is  it stranger to live?
Is it stranger to die?
What would I do?
What would I do?
If a white, wooden cross meant that I'd lost you
Tell me no lies
Tell me no lies
Is it stranger to live?
Is it stranger to be alive?
For all the people that I am not
And all their prayers and all their thoughts
There's so much more out there
Than here where I stand
I blow my horn for the whole bandEmbed
