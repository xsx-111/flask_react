We Were Lucky LyricsAll I saw from where I stood
The sun was smiling down on us
We were lucky, that's for sure
I was yours
Now all I see from where I'm from
Empty auditorium
We were lucky, that's for sure
I was yours
And you didn't mind
Being mine
There was a pop in my ear
As I left the atmosphere
Draggin' behind my mind
It's too late
Don't say it
Don't say...
All I saw from where I stood
Three long mountains and a wood
I'm lucky, that's for sure
I'm yours
And you didn't mind
Being mineEmbed
