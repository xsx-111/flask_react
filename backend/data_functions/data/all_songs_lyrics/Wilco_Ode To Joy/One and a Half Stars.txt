One and a Half Stars Lyrics
I wish too much for you to care
Goldfish I won at the fair
Meet the mother, can't complain
There is no mother like pain

I'm left with only my desire to change
So what? I stay in bed all day
I can't escape my domain
Two stories high in bed all day
I can't escape my domain

You mean too much to me
I'm angry
I could need so much
I'm worried about the way
We're all living
And this is my love song

I'm left with only my desire to change
So if I stay in bed all day
I won't escape my domain
Two stories high in bed all day
I can't escape my domain
I can't escape my domain
I won't escape my domain1Embed
