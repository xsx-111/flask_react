Life For This Road Lyrics
Staring at the roadside
The wreckage can be clearly seen
Oh, one hand on your leg
One hand on the wheel
Haven't always been a smooth ride
Damn right, we're gonna come all clean
Oh, one hand on your leg
One hand

Maybe a better man would keep you off of this road
But there's only one way to get to where we wanna go
We can drive through the danger, you know it's gonna be gone
If we don't prove ourselves, how will we ever know?
How will we ever know? I give my life to this road

You ask me if we'll be alright
You're only scared and I feel what you feel
Oh, one hand on your hand
One hand on the wheel
You ask me how much further
We won't know until we get there
Oh, one hand on your hand
One hand
Maybe a better man would keep you off of this road
But there's only one way to get to where we gotta go
We can drive through the danger, you know it's gonna be gone
If we don't prove ourselves, how will we ever know?
How will we ever know? I give my life to this road
I give my life for this roadEmbed
