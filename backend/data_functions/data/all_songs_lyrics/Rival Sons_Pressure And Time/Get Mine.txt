Get Mine LyricsI'm done wasting my time
I'm tired of picking off the fleas
I've got a coffee can full of liquor
Store change that I've been counting on my knees
Get off the floor, look in the mirror
Keep looking that good, some girl's gonna buy your dinner
Got so much money, I know I owe
Go downstairs and my car's getting' towed
I've got to get mine, make it through the day
Get mine, I've got bills to pay
I've got to get mine, I can find a way
I've got to get mine
I've got blood on my lips
I've got a head full of rhymes
I've got a pistol on my hip
And a long list of names of people running out of time
Sleep with a pistol under my head
It's full of water 'cause I can't afford the lead
Plenty of butter, the women keep me fed
My only problem is that I can't find the bread
I've got to get mine, make it through the day
Get mine, I've got the bills to pay
I've got to get mine, I can find a way
I've got to get mineEmbed
