Face of Light LyricsIf I can get through the day
I have a date with the moon
That's how I spend all my worthless time on the sand
Thinking that my ship will be coming soon
Look at these hands
They've been in gloves for years
That's how I spend all my worthless rounds in the ring
Hoping that the other guy will disappear
But you and your face of light
It's a brilliant Roman candle that separates the day from the night
It's that clean, clear truth that sorts our the wrong from the right
You and your face of light
If I can get through tonight
I'm waking up with my wings
There's no way I can sleep my way through a fight
And I think I'm gonna like what tomorrow brings
Look at my eyes
Don't even know who I am
That's how I spend all my worthless time on the floor
Waiting for you to tell me I'm a man
But you and your face of light
It's a brilliant Roman candle that separates the day from the night
It's that clean, clear truth that sorts our the wrong from the right
You and your face of lightEmbed
