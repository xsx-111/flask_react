Young Love LyricsWell your daddy's gone too far this time
And I combed my hair, been putting up front
But his little girl's man is about to draw the line
Nobody's gonna keep me from what I want
She's my young love
Young love
Well the train out of Gainesville leaves at nine
And I shaved my face and sold my bike
I've got a factory job up in North Caroline
And we can name our kids whatever we like
She's my young love
Young love
"So if I leave with you, darling I've got to know are you gonna tale care
Of me?"
Oh baby, I'll put diamonds in your mouth
Birds on your shoulders, limousine in the driveway
Rings on your fingers and marble under your feet
She's my young love
Young love, That's what I wantEmbed
