White Noise LyricsThere's a message coming to me on my TV screen
Every time I try to turn it off
It tells me I'm inferior and incomplete
And I'm a fool for being satisfied with what I've got
White noise, white noise
Carrying the poison to the girls and boys
There's a message coming to me when my cellphone rings
To remind me that I'm never alone
They say the radiation will kill me eventually
Along with every machine that I own
White noise, white noise
Carrying the poison to the girls and the boys
There are natives living in the jungle
Running wild and naked through the trees
There are satellites above tracking every move
To calculate how to sell them what they'll never need
White noise, white noise
Carrying the poison to the girls and the boysEmbed
