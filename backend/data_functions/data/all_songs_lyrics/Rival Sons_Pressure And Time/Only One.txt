Only One LyricsUnder the lights, under the sheets
After all our fights, that's where we both want to be
You know that I've got my work, but you've got your needs
Straight back into your arms is where this long road leads
You are my only one
And when times get hard I've got to make you see
You are my only one
And that's not even half of what you are to me
You're trying to keep up our home, while I'm chasing my dreams
I need to hear your voice, but the telephone just rings
Another night spent alone, while I'm up on the stage
In some Midwest town refusing to act my age
You are my only one
And when times get hard I've got to make you see
You are my only one
And that's not even half of what you are to me
And it's a long road that leads me back to you
My onlyEmbed
