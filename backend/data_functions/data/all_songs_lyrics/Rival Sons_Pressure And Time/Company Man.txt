Company Man Lyrics
Now they got it situated
Got me eatin' from the palm of their hand
No clockin' in, no clockin' out
So tired I can barely stand
They say, "Get shit together"
You've been late three times in two weeks
Did you get the memo printed on your pillow?
Lately your performance stinks

Ooo, oh yeah
Run just as fast as you can
Ooo, oh yeah
The devil knows the heart of a company man

Day and night
Day after day
Got me too tired to think, too weak to fight
So my dreams won't get in their way
You got me beggin' for a game
And the sun ain't gonna give me some sleep
Don't send me no flowers, crack on the whip
Dig a hole 40 feet deep
Ooo, oh yeah
Run just as fast as you can
Ooo, oh yeah
The devil knows the heart of a company man
Ooo, oh yeah
Run just as fast as you can
Ooo, oh yeah
The devil knows the heart of a company man

Oh yeah
Run just as fast as you can
Ooo, oh yeah
The devil knows the heart of a company man
Ooo, oh yeah
Run just as fast as you can
Ooo, oh yeah
The devil knows the heart of a company manEmbed
