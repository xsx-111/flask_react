Burn Down Los Angeles LyricsI come from the mountains, down to the water
I come to drink from the dreams of your sons and daughters
I come from the summer off of the rails
With my hammer in hand about to hit it on the nail
Gotta burn down Los Angeles, burn down Los Angeles
Burn down Los Angeles, I'm gonna burn down Los Angeles
Gonna burn
I come for revenge for my broken dreams
I didn't come to wait tables or park limousines
I come to get up from my hands and knees
I come to steal the honey from those killer bees
Burn down Los Angeles, I'm gonna burn down Los Angeles, yes
Burn down Los Angeles, I'm gonna burn down Los Angeles
I'm gonna burn
