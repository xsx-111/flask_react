Gypsy Heart LyricsStaring at the sun, you know I've got my Papa's eyes
Forty years at the mill, and two checks every month's got the poor man
Hyptnotized
He said, "Don't do what I've done, go out son and claim your prize."
"Stay out from under the hand of the man". That was his best advice
I've got a gypsy heart
Give me something's gonna make me stay
I've got a gypsy heart
Sun comes up on another day
Thank you for the kisses but I've got to get on my way
You can call me what you want
But I've got a compass and a native will
Say I'm lazy; ugly, tell me I'm a freak
But your daughter's waiting up on the hill
You know she'll say, "Oooh, oh, tell me about your reckless ways"
She'll say, "Oooh, oh". She'll be pining for the rest of her days for a
Gypsy
I've got a gypsy heart
Give me something's gonna make me stay
I've got a gypsy heart
End of the bottle and I'm walking away
Don't ask me where I'm going cause' you know that I just can't say
Play when I work, work when I play
Thank the Good Lord het let me love to see another dayEmbed
