Pressure and Time LyricsGive me only what I need
It doesn't take too much to keep me satisfied
Down to work for my money and earn my keep
Hunger's got a way to tame a man's pride
Can we build it up?
I know that we can
Let's get to work every woman and man
With pressure and time
I said I'm gonna get mine
I'm not asking for a throne and crown
I'm not pining for a starving queen
Tooth and nail will wear any man down
And my Mama keeps telling me I'm lookin' too lean
Can we build it up?
I know that we can
Let's get to work every woman and man
With pressure and time
I said I'm gonna get mine
Take me out of this mudslide or never enough
Let me eat from the fruit right off of the tree
When God gets his rest because six days are just too rough
I can only pray he doesn't forget about me3Embed
