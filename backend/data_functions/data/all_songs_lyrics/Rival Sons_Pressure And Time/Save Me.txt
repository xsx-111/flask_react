Save Me LyricsI know that everybody wants somebody they can trust
To pull their head right out of the sand
I look forward and behind but I can't seem to find
Someone to take the snakes our of my hand
I climbed up the mountain and I killed the beast
Just because they said it couldn't be done
Come home to an empty house
Got nothing to eat and I'm still on the run
Who's gonna save me, who's gonna save me?
You know the river is deep and the water is cold
And the sun's burning up my eyes
I've got promises to keep and I just can't sleep
Until my dreams get materialized
I know that everybody wants somebody they can trust
And a body that they can lean on
I get ready for the rumble
Look over my shoulder and all my friends are gone
Who's gonna save me, who's gonna save me?Embed
