The Bandstand Lyrics
You stand in the doorway
A block up the street
Ringing the doorbell
There's tapping of feet
High, yellow hair
And a worn brown suit
Enter and break the news

Now, tell me the story
I give it the time
No need to worry
Everything's fine
I'll take you away
From this name-calling scene
Sure, you can bring your magazine

Cold and windblown on the old bandstand
You and I walking hand in hand
A neon glow shining down on us
Don't wait up for us, don't wait up for us

Now, tell me the story
I'll give it the time
When you stop looking
Then you will find
I'll take you away
From this name-calling scene
Just bring your magazine
Cold and windblown on the old bandstand
You and I walking hand in hand
A neon glow shining down on us
Don't wait up for us, don't wait up for us
Cold and windblown on the old bandstand
You and I walking hand in hand
A neon glow shining down on us
Don't wait up for us, don't wait up for us
Don't wait up for us, don't wait up for us
Don't wait up for us, don't wait up for us
Don't wait up for us, don't wait up for us
Don't wait up for us, don't wait up for us
Don't wait up for us, don't wait up for usEmbed
