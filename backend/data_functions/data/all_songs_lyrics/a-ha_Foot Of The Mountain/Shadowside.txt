Shadowside Lyrics
The shadowside you say I have
Is making everything go bad
You say I don't care enough
For all the things that I have got

But I do
And I will

I don't want to see myself descend
Into the shadowside again
If you ever let me go again
In the shadowside I'll end

The shadowside where I go
I'm never where I'm needed so
You say I don't give enough
That I don't care for all I've got

But I do
And I will
I don't want to let myself descend
Into the shadowside again
If you're letting go of me again
In the shadowside
But I do
And I will
Yes, I will

I don't want to let myself descend
Into the shadowside again
If you're letting go of me again
In the shadowside I'll end

In the shadowside I'll endEmbed
