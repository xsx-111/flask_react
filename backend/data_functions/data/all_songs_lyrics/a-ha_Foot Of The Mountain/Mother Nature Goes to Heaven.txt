Mother Nature Goes to Heaven LyricsWrong
You never got it wrong
You always got it right
But now some time has passed;
You're ever so slightly off
Thing you could do asleep
In a not too distant past
Are trying your patience
Harder now
And though
Everything moves along
You hope the rumor's wrong
That Mother Nature
Goes to heaven
Right
You never got it wrong
It always got away
When you had it nailed
It was ever so slightly off
Sending you somewhere else
Than where you had to be
Making it that much
Harder now
And though
You're struggling to get on track
It pales somewhat to the fact
That Mother Nature goes to heaven
And there will be no sadder day
When all the birds
Have flown awayEmbed
