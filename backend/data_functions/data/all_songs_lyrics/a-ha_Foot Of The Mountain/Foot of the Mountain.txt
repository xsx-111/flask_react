Foot of the Mountain Lyrics
Keep your clever lines, hold your easy rhymes
Silence everything, silence always wins
It's a perfect alibi, there's no need to analyze
It will be all right through the longest night, just silence everything

But we could live by the foot of a mountain
We could clear us a yard in the back
Build a home by the foot of the mountain
We could stay there and never come back

Learn from my mistake, leave what others take
Speak when spoken to and do what others do
Silence always wins, so silence everything
It will be all right in the morning light, just silence everything

But we could live by the foot of a mountain
We could clear us a yard in the back
Build a home by the foot of the mountain
We could stay there and never come back
We could stay there and never come back
You know it, we could leave tonight
But we could live by the foot of a mountain
We could make us a white picket fence
Build a home by the foot of the mountain
We could stay there and see how it ends
Yes, we could stay there and see how it ends
We could stay there and see how it ends
We could stay there and see how it endsEmbed
