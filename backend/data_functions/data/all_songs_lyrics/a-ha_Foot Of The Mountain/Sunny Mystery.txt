Sunny Mystery LyricsYou can run through every forest
You can sail on the seven seas
You can climb the highest mountain
To try and dissolve these memories
In case you never knew it
You can't undo it
You can jump off the edge of the world
Hide out in some monastery
Lose your mind in meditation
And never put your mind at ease
You think you're running to it
But you're wading through it
A sunny mystery
You think you're running to it
But you're wading through it
A sunny mystery
A sunny mystery
Life is the dream that you wake up to
Dreams are the life from which you wake
Everybody makes the extra effort
Never knowing what to do
You thought you know the answer
Yeah, you know the score
It feels just like before
It's a sunny mystery
That's how it's got to be
Because no one knows for sure
The outcome of this sunny mysteryEmbed
