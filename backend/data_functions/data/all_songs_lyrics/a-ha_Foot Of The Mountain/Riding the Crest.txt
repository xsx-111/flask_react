Riding the Crest Lyrics
You search your mind
That's what it's there for
Check all the whys
And all the wherefores
In your mind
You're tall and brave
Riding the crest
Of a high and beautiful wave

You make your movements known
And where you want to be
And everybody knows
That's how it's got to be
In the sheltered morning sun
In the sheltered morning sun

Internally
You make your own rules
You'll have excuses
The ones that you choose
In the end
You deem unsafe
Riding the crest
Of a high and beautiful wave
You make your movements known
And where you want to be
And everybody knows
That's how it's got to be
In the sheltered morning sun
In the sheltered morning sun
There comes a time
You don't even know what's missing
Some sugar to make the pill go down
You need a line
A push in the right direction
Some sugar to make the pill go down
True
True to form
True to pre-
Existing norms
Truly wasted
At a rave
Riding the crest
Of a high and beautiful wave
Riding the crest
Of a high and beautiful wave
You make your movements known
And where you want to be
And everybody knows
That's how it's got to be
In the sheltered morning sun
In the sheltered morning sun
In the sheltered morning sun
In the sheltered morning sun
In the sheltered morning sunEmbed
