Real Meaning LyricsDon't change me
I'm going to break if you try
Don't change you
You know the tears I'm going to cry
And I sure will
Miss us when we're gone
You're the real meaning of the Sun
It shows you off to everyone
You're the real meaning of the Sun
It shows you off to everyone
The real meaning
I want the real meaning
Don't fix me
It breaks my heart to see you try
Don't fix you
And leave me for some other guy
And I sure will
Miss us when weâ€™re done
You're the real meaning of the Sun
It shows you off to everyone
You're the real meaning of the Sun
It shows you off to everyone
When I'm thinking about you fondly
Then I'm thinking about the only
Real meaning of the Sun
You're the real meaning of the Sun
It shows you off to everyone
You're the real meaning of the stars
It guides me to the place you are
The real meaning, yeah
I want the real meaning
The real meaning, mm
I want the real meaningEmbed
