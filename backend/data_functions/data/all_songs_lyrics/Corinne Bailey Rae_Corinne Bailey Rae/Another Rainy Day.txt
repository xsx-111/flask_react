Another Rainy Day LyricsI got taken in
We feasted on olives from the fridge
We stood the whole lonely day
We made love all afternoon
Til the stars went blue
You wrote a ballad
We dined on oysters and champagne
That's it seemed like
We connect in so many ways
So easy, I must say
Why am I so shy around you?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care to astound you?
Why do I even try?
Another rainy day
We sat inside by the radiator Watching old black and white films
Where everybody sang
You played in my solitude
Didn't get dressed 'til 2
The rain says all
I wrote this song on my guitar
But it didn't turn out right
So we just connected in other ways
So easy, I must say
Why am I so shy around you?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care to astound you?
Why do I even try?
Why am I so shy around...?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care...?
Why do I even try?1Embed
