Breathless LyricsSeems like everyone else has a love just for them
I don't mind; we have such a good time, my best friend
But sometimes, well I wish we could be more than friends
Tell me, do you know?
Tell me, do you know?
Oh
I get so breathless when you call me name
I've often wondered, do you feel the same?
There's a chemistry, energy, a synchronicity when we're all alone
So don't tell me you can't see what I'm thinking of
I can understand that you don't want to cross the line
And you know I can't promise you things will turn out fine
But I have to be honest: I want you to be mine
Tell me, do you know?
Tell me, do you know?
Oh
I get so breathless when you call me name
I've often wondered, do you feel the same?
There's a chemistry, energy, a synchronicity when we're all alone
So don't tell me (don't you tell me) you can't see
Oh!
'Cause I've tried to do this right in your own time
I've been telling with my eyes my heart's on fire; why don't you realize?
Tell me, do you know?
Tell me, do you know?
I get so breathless (I get so breathless when you call my name)
I've often wondered, do you feel the same?
There's a chemistry, energy, a synchronicity when we're alone
So don't tell me (don't you tell me) you can't see what I'm thinking of
I get so breathless when you call me name
I've often wondered, do you feel the same?
There's a chemistry, energy, a synchronicity when we're all alone
So don't tell me (don't you tell me) you can't see what I'm thinking of1Embed
