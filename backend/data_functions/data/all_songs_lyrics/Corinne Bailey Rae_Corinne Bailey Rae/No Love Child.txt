No Love Child LyricsTheres no love
Theres no love child
Theres no love baby no love for your child
Well I've been searching high
I've been searching low
To feel this completeness
Everywhere that i go
Maybe if i just keep walking
Walking , walking
Through my mind I'll stumble on it
Somewhere
And somehow in this place and time
I will lose my worried mind
Where's the love (x4)
When the sunlight hurt my eyes
I got to open what inside
Sort this fear
I got to hide
I'm pulling down my pride
Precious love i hold inside
Strangers smiling wide at me
Been looking for piece of mind
I've been looking in the wrong direction
Give me your love sweet baby
Give me your love sweet childEmbed
