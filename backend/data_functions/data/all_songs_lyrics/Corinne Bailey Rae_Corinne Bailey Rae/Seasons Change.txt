Seasons Change LyricsOh oh oh...
Maybe you've been pouring everything into this your mistake of
This attends to agony, you can't predict this when it comes to it
You can't hide from me, but don't you surrender anything..
Don't you know that, that patience is a virtue (yes it is)
And life is a waiting game...don't you know that, peace must be nurtured
And all the money in the world can buy you nothing... (i tell you that)
All these things happen, all these things happen for a reason
Don't you go on and throw it all away ...when the seasons change (you gonna change)...
Oh oh...
Hurts me to see you feel this way but it won't be always
Don't you know everything got to change
Oh... feels like all your hope is gone
You can't carry on, but there's nothing oh
You don't have to pretend with me, don't you know that
That patience is a virtue, (yes it is), and life is a waiting game
Don't you know that, peace must be nurtured...
All the money in the world can buy you nothing, (let me tell you that)...
All these things happen, all these I've done for a reason...
Don't you go on throw it all away , when the seasons change
Oh oh oh...
When the seasons changeEmbed
