Butterfly LyricsIn my mother's house
There's a photograph
Of a day gone past
Always makes me laugh
There's a little girl
Wary of the world
She got much to learn
Get her fingers burned
An affinity
Between you and me
Cause we're family
Said that I'd be fine
Give me all your time
And I left your side
Like a butterfly
Shower me with your love
All of everyday
You make the red rose sun
Shine on me
Lift me up so high
Watch me fly away
And you give me life
Like a butterfly
In my mother's house
There was happiness
I wrapped my myself in it
Was my chrysalis
As my life unfolds
See a pattern through
Of you protecting me
And I protecting you
What was that you'd say
Make your own mistakes
And when you're grown
Make sure that you remain the same
Now I realise
What was on your mind
When I left your side
Like a butter fly
Shower me with your love
All of everyday
You make the red rose sun
Shine on me
Lift me up so high
Watch me fly away
Give me life
Like a butterfly
Shower me with your love
All of everyday
You make the red rose sun
Shine on me
Lift me up so high
Watch me fly away
Give me life
Like a butterflyEmbed
