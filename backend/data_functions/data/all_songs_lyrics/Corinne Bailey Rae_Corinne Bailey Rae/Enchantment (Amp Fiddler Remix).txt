Enchantment (Amp Fiddler Remix) LyricsI wait for you
I don't know why
All i know is i can't hide
At this temperature you could take over my mind
Like gossamer, you softly touch
He draws me in, i'm powerless
He possesses an enchantment
Tell me i'm forgiven
He calls, don't know how i fell under his spell
Lately i've been driven. he smiles, an enchantment
I wait for you
I'm mesmerized this love is like a potion in disguise
I'd tightrope walk with a blindfold on my eyes
I can't escape, or so it seems
I'd run away, he's in my dreams
He possesses an enchantment
Tell me i'm forgiven
He calls, don't know how i fell under his spell
Lately i've been driven
He smiles, an enchantment
It's the kind of sleepwalk that never ends
A type of loan with no dividends
It's a parlour game where you're given chase
Guess it could be called an acquired taste
I know, he knows, he calls, i go, i know
This could be an enchantment
Why don't you tell me i'm forgiven?
He calls, don't you know how i fell under his spell
I'm forgiven...lately i've been driven
He smiles and i give in
