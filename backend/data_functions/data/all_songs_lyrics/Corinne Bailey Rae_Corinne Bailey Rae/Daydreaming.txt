Daydreaming Lyrics(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin´ of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin´ of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin´ of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin´ of you)
(Look at my mind floating away)
He's the kind of guy that would say
Hey baby let's get away let's go some where, huh?
Where I don't care
He's the kind of guy that will give you everything
And trust your heart, share all of your love, till death do you part
I want to be what he wants when he wants it, and whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed it
Lovin' him a little bit more each day
He turns me right on when I hear him say
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far
(Baby can we?)
Where I don't care
I love to hear him say
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far
(Baby can we?)
Well I don't care
I wanna be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
When it comes to being feelin' loved starved I'll be there to please him
Lovin him a little bit more each day
It turns me right on when I hear him say
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far)
(Baby can we?) Where, I don't care
I love to hear him say
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far)
(Baby can we?) Where, I don´t care
(Day dreamin and I'm thinkin of you)
(Day dreamin and I'm thinkin of you) hoooo
(Day dreamin and I'm thinkin of you)
(Day dreamin and I'm thinkin of you)
(Look at my mind, floating away)]
(Day dreaming) day dreaming of you
(Day dreaming)
Thinking of you
