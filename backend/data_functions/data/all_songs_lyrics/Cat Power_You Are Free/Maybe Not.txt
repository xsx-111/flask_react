Maybe Not Lyrics
There's a dream that I see, I pray it can be
Look across the land, shake this land
A wish or a command
A dream that I see, don't kill it, it's free
You're just a man, you get what you can

We all do what we can
So we can do just one more thing
We can all be free
Maybe not in words
Maybe not with a look
But with your mind

Listen to me, don't walk that street
There's always an end to it
Come and be free, you know who I am
We're just a living people

We won't have a thing
So we got nothing to lose
We can all be free
Maybe not with words
Maybe not with a look
But with your mind
You've got to choose a wish or command
If the turn of the tide is weathering thee
Remember one thing, the dream you can see
Pray it to be, shake this land

We all do what we can
So we can do just one more thing
We won't have a thing
So we've got nothing to lose
We can all be free
Maybe not with words
Maybe not with a look
But with your mind
But with your mind1Embed
