Evolution Lyrics
Better call all the ships
They been caught sailing
Better call the captain
He's been caught stealing
Better call the porter man
He's been caught leaving
Better call all the guys on the deck
They been caught with no feeling
Better call the fisherman
'Cause they're coming on land
Better call the head nurse
To wrap us up and throw us in the dirt
Better call with some resistance
Better way to feel no shame
Better call with some persistence
Better way to feel nothing at all
Better call on evolution
Better way to make a revolution
Better make your mind up quick
Better make your mind up quick

Better call all the ships
They been caught sailing
Better call the captain
He's been caught stealing
Better call the porter man
He's been caught leaving
Better call all the guys on the deck
They've been caught with no feeling
Better call the fisherman
'Cause they're coming on land
Better call the head nurse
To wrap us up and throw us in the dirt
Better call with some resistance
Better way to feel no shame
Better call with some persistence
Better way to feel nothing at all
Better call on evolution
Better way to make a revolution
Better make your mind up quick
Better make your mind up quick
Better make up your mind quick
Better make up your mind quickEmbed
