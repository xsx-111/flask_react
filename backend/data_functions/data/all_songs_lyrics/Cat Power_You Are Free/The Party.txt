The Party LyricsGood friends come out now
The party is about to begin
We can wrestle down to the floor
Throw empty bottles out the door
They'll smash and we will laugh
What a guess we have had
The light from the window
Look as of dancing shadows
Music from the back room
Is an old song we all know
Through smiling eyes and shining faces
We all sing along
(It's) been so long since I've seen you
My good friends
This memory daydream
Is good enough for me
If you were here today
We'd be getting into frisky business
Maybe some of the daydream memoryEmbed
