Free Lyrics
Everybody come together
Free
Everybody get together
Free

It's ok if ya can't stand to let her dance
It's ok, it's your right
Come on and take a chance
A true romance when you dance
Free

Don't be in love with the autograph
Just be in love when ya scream that song (on and on)
Free

Everybody come together
Free
Everybody get together
Free

You can't feed her from the palm
That you're holding on your arm
Cool hands from the get go
Can ya feast on the real one
Don't be in love with the autograph
Just be in love when ya love that song (on and on)
Free

It's ok if ya can't stand to let her dance
It's ok, it's your right
Come on and take a chance
A true romance when you dance
Free

Everybody come together
Free

Don't fall in love with the autograph
Just fall in love when ya sing your song (on and on)

Take a chance
A true romance when ya dance

Free!
Free!
Free!
Free!
