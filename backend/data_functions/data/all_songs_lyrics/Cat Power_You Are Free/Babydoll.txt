Babydoll LyricsBaby
Black, black, black is all you see
Don't you want to be free?
Baby
Red, red fire is what you breathe
Don't you want to be clean?
Honey, the shape you're in
Is worth every dime you spent
Baby Doll
Turn out the lights
Set yourself on fire, say goodnight
Did you have a real cool time?
Baby
Black, black, black is all you see
Don't you want to be free?Embed
