He War LyricsI never meant to be the needle that broke your back
You were here, you were here, and you were here
Don't look back
I never meant to be the needle that broke your back
You were here, you were here, and you were here
Don't look back
He war he war
He will kill for you
He war he war
He will kill for you
From who you can
You know you can
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
I'm not that hot new chick
And if you won't let me run with it
We're on to your same old trick
Get up and run away with it
I'm not that hot new chick
And if you won't let me run with it
We're on to your same old trick
Get up and run away with it
Hey hey hey
He war he war
He will kill for you
Hey hey hey
He war he war
He will kill for you
Hey hey hey
From who you can
Hey hey hey
You know you can
Hey hey hey
He war he war
He will kill for you
Hey hey hey
He war he war
He will kill for you
Hey hey hey
From who you can
Hey hey hey
You know you can1Embed
