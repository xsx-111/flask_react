Names LyricsHis name was Perry
He had a learning difficulty
His father was a very mean man
His father burned his skin
His father sent him to his death
He was ten years old
He was ten years old
He was ten years old
Her name was Naomi
Beautiful round face, so ashamed
Told me how to please a man
After school in the back of a bus
She was doin' it every day
She was eleven years old
She was eleven years old
She was eleven years old
Her name was Sheryl
Black hair, like an electric space
She would pretty paint my face
She was very good friend
Her father would come to her in the night
She was twelve years old
She was twelve years old
She was twelve years old
His name was Donovan
He was a very good friend
The cards were stacked against him
He was selling cocaine
The last time I saw him
He was thirteen years old
He was thirteen years old
He was thirteen years old
His name was Charles
He said he was in love with me
We were both fourteen
Then I had to move away
Then he began to smoke crack
Then he had to sell ass
I don't know where he is
I don't know where they areEmbed
