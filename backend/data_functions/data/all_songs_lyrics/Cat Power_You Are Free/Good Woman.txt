Good Woman Lyrics
I want to be a good woman
And I want for you to be a good man

This is why I will be leaving
And this is why I can't see you no more
I will miss your heart so tender
And I will love this love forever

I don't want to be a bad woman
And I can't stand to see you be a bad man
I will miss your heart so tender
And I will love this love forever

And this is why I am leaving
And this is why I can't see you no more
This is why I am lying when I say
That I don't love you no more

'Cause I want to be a good woman
And I want for you to be a good man4Embed
