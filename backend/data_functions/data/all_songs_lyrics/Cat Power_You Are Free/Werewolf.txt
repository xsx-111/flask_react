Werewolf LyricsOh the werewolf, the werewolf comes stepping along
He don't even break the branches where he's gone
Once I saw him in the moonlight when the bats were flying
I saw the werewolf and the werewolf was crying
How nobody knows, nobody knows, body knows
How I loved the man, as I teared off his clothes
How nobody knows, nobody knows my pain
When I see that it's risen, that full moon again
For the werewolf, the werewolf has seen apathy
For the werewolf, somebody like you and me
And only he goes to me, man, this little flute I play
All through the night until the light of day
And we are doomed to play
For the werewolf, the werewolf has seen apathy
For the werewolf, somebody like you and meEmbed
