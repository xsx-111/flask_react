Shaking Paper LyricsHold the gun
Way deep down
Look out, young son
Look out, young son
A good thing is coming
'Cause the good thing is coming
Big shotguns with no guns
Big shot army with no army at all
I don't know what is worse
And I can't tell what is the best
People emphasize the way of the world
Demons despise the sound of shaking paper
But guess what?
I found out
That
You
Do
Too
Hold the gun
Way deep down
Look out, young son
Look out, young son
'Cause a good thing is coming
'Cause the good thing is coming
Big shotgun with no gun
Big shot army with no army at all
I don't know what is worse
And I can't tell what is the best
People emphasize the way of the world
Demons despise the sound of shaking paper
But guess what?
I found out
That
You
Do
Too
'Cause a good thing is coming
'Cause a good thing is coming
'Cause a good thing is coming
'Cause a good thing is comingEmbed
