Speak for Me Lyrics
Pick us up we're all by ourselves
The great big howling is about to begin
A thousand miles from where it all begins
Old world, the whole world is

Going on and on
(Forfeit, the shape to fit)
The backhand to a touch is moving on again
(Forfeit, the shape to fit)
Going on and on, you know
(Forfeit, the shape to fit)

Whats next? I'm out of time
Losing my touch, I can't feel
Speak for me
Can you see the same signs?
Do you know how
To read between the lines?
All in all, it's all or none, all for one
What you want?

Pick us out of a line up
Stranded and strange just as innocent as kids
The found are leaving and they're trying to forget
The old world, the whole world is
Going on and on
(Forfeit, the shape to fit)
The backhand to a touch is moving on again
(Forfeit, the shape to fit)
Going on and on, you know
(Forfeit, the shape to fit)

Whats next? I'm out of time
Losing my touch, I can't feel
Speak for me
Can you see the same signs?
Do you know how
To read between the lines?
All in all, it's all or none, all for one
What you want?

Going on and onEmbed
