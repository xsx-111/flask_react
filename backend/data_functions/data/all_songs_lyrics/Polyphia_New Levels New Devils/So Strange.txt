So Strange Lyrics
And if nothing's changed at all
Should it be so strange at all
Oh baby I need you
To hold my hand whenever you’re here
And I must admit that I
Think of you like every night
Your eyes and your smile
I can't seem to get it out of my mind

And if nothing's changed at all
Should it be so strange at all
Oh baby I need you
To hold my hand whenever you’re here
And I must admit that I
Think of you like every night
Your eyes and your smile
I can't seem to get it out of my mind

And if nothing's changed at all
Should it be so strange at all
Oh baby I need you
To hold my hand whenever you're here
And I must admit that I
Think of you like every night
Your eyes and your smile
I can't seem to get it out of my mind1Embed
