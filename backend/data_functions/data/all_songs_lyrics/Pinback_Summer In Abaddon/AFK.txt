AFK LyricsWe're too late, we're too late
Release the rigging
No one uses the phone anymore
The tracks are wrecked and the odometer's ticking
The edge is pushed and the lines are melting
Too scared to look at what I hear outside
Release
We're too late
Protect, embrace, engulf
Remember the summer in Abaddon
Protect, enslave, in love
Remember the summer in Abaddon
Way offsides and I'm almost empty
I'm cracked and stripped like a domino's crush
Send a tell if you're ever near me
I'm A.F.K and I can't get by
Release me
This vessel's underway
Secure the rigging, we're headed south
Tack the sails, man the posts
We're headed south into the wind
Protect, embrace, engulf
Remember the summer in Abaddon
Protect, enslave, in love
Remember the summer in Abaddon
(We're too late)
Protect, embrace, engulf
Remember, the summer, in Abaddon
Protect, enslave, in love
Remember, the summer, in Abaddon
No one hears you fall to the floor
The mirror's broke and the newtonian's clicking
The finds are pressed and the veins are pumping
Too far gone to do more than breathe
Release me
This vessels underway
Headed south
Miles and miles of telephone poles
Fallen and tossed around
I can't talk to you anymore
And I miss you
And I miss you
Not in a Slint way, but I miss you
Seldom to touch far away from here
Even if I'm released
I can't talk to you anymore
And I miss you
Not in a Slint way, but I miss you1Embed
