The Yellow Ones LyricsI feel my head goin' down again
You disappear from the foreground
I'm unaware which way is down
A major repair is underway
Require a blanket of silence
There's some strange shape in the sky
A bright light over the horizon
It's changing direction now
It's headed towards the village
Better warn...
Hey! Above you!
Waves about to...
Verified on here. Terrified, aren't you?
Where am I?
Home Ahead. Fall over
