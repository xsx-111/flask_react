Scent LyricsWait to get started (wait to get started)
Rest awhile
Take a deep breath cause this could be the one that puts you down
In the books or just six feet underground
There's a limit but I don't know what that is
There's an answer but I just don't know what gives
Good foundation
Rests on a tragic of the point
Test a viewpoint
Matches the markings on the bill
And what they found
In the space between apartments and the liquor store
When I get some statements from those present at the scene
Knowing what was previously done to beat it down
When the whole experience got strained
I know what I saw
And you can't make me question my own mind
Even if it's wrong like that one time
And all those other times
That we don't talk about
Wait to get started (wait to get started)
Rest awhile
And if they'd spent another day
They'd find a certain ambience
To point your way and that is homicide
You are always the circumstantial evidence
