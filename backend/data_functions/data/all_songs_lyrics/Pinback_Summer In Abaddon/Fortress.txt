Fortress LyricsToo long til fall, sick summer in bed
You and a lazy mood
Ten times the fall
Spread, sacked, and I've failed
Nobody move, nobody move
Too long to fall, sat shiver in bed
You and a test of will
Too many fallen, too many failed
Nobody move, nobody move
Days with the light off, freezing
You and I, uneasy, livid
Stop its too late
I'm feeling frustrated
I see no sign of fortress, I see no sign of fortress
Safe as a cootie wootie with you
Never pretend the chill
Too many shadows, too many sails
Nobody move, nobody move
Summer is only winter with you
How can you really feel?
2 of another, none of a pair
Nobody move, nobody move
Another delay. too many hassles
Where do we go? how do we follow?1Embed
