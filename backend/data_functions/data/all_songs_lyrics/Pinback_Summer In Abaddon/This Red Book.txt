This Red Book LyricsAnd I don't know how it goes
I've found another way though
Tells us all it knows
I've finally caught a deal
Your face above
Fades out all the reels
Your face above
Fazes all there is
Uh oh - There's a spot in my eye
Uh oh - There's a pill I have missed
The cloves of garlic flow
Like surfing down Pompeii
I'm messing up your show
You really should have guessed
Your face above
The only spark I need
Your face above
If I could reach your throat
Uh oh - I could strangle you all
Uh oh - Did I say that out loud?
Although it passed the mail
It blew a fuse and bailed
It's too blue to be ours
And though it passed as red
It's too far off and best guess
Has it soaked at home
Uh oh - There's a spot in my eye
Uh oh - There's a pill I have missed
And this little red book knows
It's become my every day
I've taped over your show
You really should have guessed
Your face above
The only spark I need
Your face above
If I could reach your throat
Uh oh - I could strangle you all
Uh oh - Did I say that out loud?
And though the text was fed
Too obvious, they said
And moved it underground
Between the lines they met
Like sulphur burns they spread
Too angry to go out
Light my heard
Make me burn out
Like your nameEmbed
