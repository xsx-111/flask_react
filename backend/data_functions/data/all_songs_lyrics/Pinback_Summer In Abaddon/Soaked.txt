Soaked LyricsToss it away
Into the water
Toss it away
Into the fire
Some minor thought fell from the sky
Nobody wants that either
Paper model plane glued to your spine
Severing off your feelings
Toss it away
Into the water
Toss it away
Into the fire
It might've faded, you decide
Hell of a night
Bat of an eye
You started screaming blue murder, true
That's so you and you're soaked through
You took them all
You closed the bar without me
You chose the fall
You took them all without meEmbed
