Non Photo-Blue LyricsShe's posting all the time, but the boards are down
It's a burnt-out building
He's spending all his time on his back
Staring at the ceiling
They spend themselves that way
I'm with that, I'm with them
You aren't. You are alive, dammit
Gnawing on the prey
I think about you some
Where to put you?
All the backed up data for a raining time
Insulate a fragile mind
Capsulize a broken find
Don't do this man
There's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning
She just ignores the time the boards came down
It's a numbed out feeling
He just accepts that pain with a hate mantra
A spiritual killing
They just relax that way
I'm with that, I'm with them
You aren't. You are alive, dammit
Crayons past line. Stay after school
Crossword filled in non-photo blue
So they'll never find you
I get the same result
We get the same effect
Can't go through this now
I'm leaving a message
Stapled on your head
Don't do this man
There's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning3Embed
