Syracuse LyricsI step down into sand
Water carries us from here
I'm fightin' this assignment
I'm wishin' we fall into the well
I'm wishin' we fall into the world
I missed your Monotone
I missed you... Far Away...
Whatever the thing that set you up
Set you off and down again
Until he's spared no reason
What he doesn't know
Could fit inside a thimbleEmbed
