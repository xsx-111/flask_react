Bloods On Fire LyricsBrain to head. What is that for?
Vein to vein. Torn and Sore
Carpet so thick and worn
Blanketed, dark, and warm
Calm yourself
Bloods on fire
Break the bed, Burn the floor
Heat to Head. Twisted. Sore
Accident. Never warned
Can't explain. Nevermore
Calm yourself
Bloods on fire
It's not in the spark that's not in your eye
Like we used to talk
It's not in the phrase that's not in the language
That we used to talk
Not in the face, You missed me. There
It's not in the science that we didn't learn
When we used to talk
Sit outside, Pen√®tance
Just let me know
Please say the words
I'm alright, what was that sound?
Woke me up, Now you're around
Pick me up, Drag me around
Don't forget to breathe now
Calm yourself
Calm yourself
Bloods on fire
Bloods on fire
We all forgot
We're all lost in Autumn
It's not in the dead shocks that dropped underneath us
When we used the car
It's not in the strings we didn't pull to move you around the floor
Where are you now?
Pacing a faceless maw somewhere vague
You're not outside. You're not inside. You're not anymore
Where did you go?
Here's to the pranks we never pulled
And never willEmbed
