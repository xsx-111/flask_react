Sender LyricsShoes crack where you walk
Settle down
Inside, outside, amazing
Cut it back
Get in some clean fresh air
Acute angles, divide my
Path that I had lost
Path that I had lost
Acute angles, divide my
Path that I had lost
Path that I had lost
Tongue tied, couldn't talk
Settle down
Inside, outside, amazing
Haven't lost
Haven't cared at all
Acute angles, divide my
Path that I had lost
Path that I had lost
Acute angles, divide my
Path that I had lost
Path that I had lost
And when you see a boat come
In a straight line
You know it's going straight down
And then you feel like a flower sender
Lender, like you
I close my eyes
Nothing to see here
Nothing to see here
Cloud tank, given off
Watered down
Inside, outside, the razing
Wasn't cool
Wasn't fair at all
Acute angles, divide my
Path that I had lost
Path that I had lost
Acute angles, divide my
Path that I had lost
Path that I had lost
I close my eyes
Nothing to see here
(I close my eyes)
And when you see the big crack in the sunlight
You know it's over somehow
And then a pinhole sky explodes out
Ball of fire
Supernova falls down on you
I close my eyes
Nothing to see here
(Ball of fire
Supernova falls down on you)
I close my eyes
Nothing to see here
I close my eyes
Nothing to see hereEmbed
