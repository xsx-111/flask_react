3x0 LyricsYour sentry-men fall behind
You're wasting my time like many crosswords do
You're breaking the line you just tripped over
Every time
Your sentry-men fall behind
Into the sunspots we vanish away
You're falling in time like penny dreadful do
Tripped over the line (again)
That's two for flinching
I'd pay anyone 20 bucks just to do that
Cause everything in this place is freezing
Except for the sound
It's just a thing that I carry around
Into the sunspots we vanish away
Saw your face in the mirror said 3 times
I flyEmbed
