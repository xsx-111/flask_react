Miles From Nowhere LyricsYou find it tempting to give up the ghost
You always sell to the one who bids the most
You get paid for your loyalty
Waiting for someone to come along and set you free
Can't you hear me?
I want to die in the same place I was born
Miles from nowhere
I used to reach for the stars but now I've reformed
She's out there somewhere
If you ever start thinking what you're doing to me
Maybe you will set me free
From this sorrow
From this sorrow
From this sorrow
All the defendants have been condemned
When you were sentenced it covered all of them
Give me justice you scream, you scream
I ain't done nothing, it's all a crazy dream
Can't you hear me?
I want to die in the same place I was born
Miles from nowhere
I used to reach for the stars but now I've reformed
She's out there somewhere
If you ever start thinking what you're doing to me
Maybe you will set me free
From this sorrow
From this sorrow
From this sorrow
I have no visions of love restrained
My only prisons are savage and deranged
Looking for passion devoid of guilt
Your cold reaction transcends the myth you built
Can't you hear me?
I want to die in the same place I was born
Miles from nowhere
I used to reach for the stars but now I've reformed
She's out there somewhere
If you ever start thinking what you're doing to me
Maybe you will set me free
From this sorrow
From this sorrow
From this sorrowEmbed
