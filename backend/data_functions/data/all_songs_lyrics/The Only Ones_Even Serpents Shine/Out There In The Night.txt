Out There In The Night LyricsYou left that morning
You gave me no warning
You were my best friend
Oh, I can't live without you
There was something about you
I want you back again
Baby, sometimes I think of you
Out there in the night
All the comforts of home have been denied
People find it hard to understand
I never cried before
One thing's for certain
There's nothing around that
Could make me cry no more
Baby, sometimes I think of you
Out there in the night
All the comforts of home have been denied
Compared to all of them
You stand out
You gave me pure unspoiled love
They're all reaching and grabbing
But all you did was give me
Love and love and love and love
Sometimes I think of you
Out there in the night
Roaming the empty streets
Looking for your life
Sometimes I think of you
Out there in the night
You ain't here with me
And nothing seems right
Sometimes I think of you
Out there in the nightEmbed
