Oh No LyricsI love ya in the morning
I love ya late at night
I could be your lover, babe
And everything'd be right
I come home in the evening
Give ya my money
All my money
Oh no, oh no, oh oh no
I could be that woman's man
I love her all the time
But is it real love? Oh no
Is it harmony? Oh no
You wanna have a family? Oh no
Looking for a washing machine? Oh no
I love ya in the morning
I love ya late at night
I could be your lover, babe
And everything'd be right
I come home in the evening
Give ya my money
All, all my money
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I could be that woman's man
I love her all the time
But is it real love? Oh no
Is it harmony? Oh no
You wanna have a family? Oh no
