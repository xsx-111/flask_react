Programme LyricsIt's a different kind of life when you're on this programme
You see things you never thought could be seen
You get the other side of life when you're on this programme, baby
Things get dirty when they look so clean
I don't even recall the things that you accuse me of
I feel so far away from everything I ever loved, I ever loved
You know you've gotta sweat when you're on this programme, honey
The lights are glaring, it's a cold heat
We're all God's children and we got
A constant struggle in the face of defeat
I've been having bad dreams, I can't get to sleep at night
I feel so far away, I'm walking on the edge of time, the edge of time
Well look at him he's hurt now, he's bleeding
The curious will come and see him
They fantasise about his life
They see humour in him
Every time you drop your guard, you find it twice as hard
To reconcile your feelings
You can always justify, all the times you've almost died
Say life ain't that appealing
That's the last you'll get, trapped by life, you
Prefer existence on the other side
The local residents are all white
And their morals are well-definedEmbed
