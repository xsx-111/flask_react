In Betweens LyricsCaught between right and wrong
Tell me, is there no escaping?
I just can't go on
Living from day to day
And sometimes when I wake up
Feel like I never woke up at all
Sordid clandestine love
It burns your heart out
Try to fix up an hour
In the back seat
Get to know each other
Can't you wait 'til the evening
When the stars are shining bright?
There's no-one around
Who could cause any danger
Who else but you
Would stay with me baby?
Ships out at sea
Oh to be free
Just like a sailor at sea
In the middle of the seaEmbed
