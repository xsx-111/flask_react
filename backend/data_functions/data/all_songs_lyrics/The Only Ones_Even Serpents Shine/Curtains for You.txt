Curtains for You LyricsThere is nothing you could hope to gain
By doing this
To be here in your arms is like
Falling off of a precipice, baby
Going down, oh down, right down
Oh no, you just can't win
There's no sense in suffering
As the rocks tumble and the earth slides too
This means it's curtains for you
This means curtains for you
This means curtains for you
You must have such a tangled mind
Oh, you blow from hot to cold
You even like to go out every Saturday night
You pale beside the image you hold
The lights dim and the circus role
Oh, roll on
Oh no, you just can't win
There's no sense in suffering
As the rocks tumble and the earth slides too
This means it's curtains for you
This means curtains for you
This means curtains for you
You never really understood me
This means curtains for you
This means curtains for you
This means curtains for you
This means curtains for youEmbed
