Someone Who Cares LyricsIf you try to follow me home tonight
You will find everything that you've heard is right
You'll never return to the home you knew
Leave it all behind, it's up to you
Who wants to be happy forever? Up to you
You know that fate brought us together
And when time has left you too weak to resist
I hope you will remember this
We survived the cold winter nights last year
Any time now my heart could melt with fear
I'm scared of losing the most precious thing I own
Wake up one day to find the bird has flown
We could have been happy forever and ever, I'm all alone
Remember that fate brought us together
Shattered dreams have left you scarred beyond repair
I hope you find someone who cares
Someone who cares
Someone who cares
And when time has left you too weak to resist
I hope you will remember thisEmbed
