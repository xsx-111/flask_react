Ode to Street Hassle LyricsWell, I've been some far out places
I've read the writing on the wall
But today I walk with Jesus and together
Together we walk tall
And as we sat there talking, Jesus turned to say to me
"You better learn to love this life, cause there's things
There's things that are hard to see,"
And as I sat there thinking, once again he said to me
He said, "I've given you temptation, but these things, these things have got to be"
So I just sat and listened to what Jesus said to me
Cause sometimes you've gotta listen if there's things
If there's things you just can't see
While we were out walking once again he turned to me
As I looked into his eyes - his thoughts, his thoughts just came to me
Well some people never listen, some people just won't see
But I can see and hear these things
These things have got to beEmbed
