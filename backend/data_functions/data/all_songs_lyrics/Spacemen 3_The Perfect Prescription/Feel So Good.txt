Feel So Good Lyrics
Lord I feel so good (Lord I feel so good today)
Lord I feel just fine (Lord I feel so fine)
Takes me out of my mind (Lord…)
Takes me out of my mind

Lord I feel so good (Lord I feel so good)
Lord I feel just fine (Lord I feel so fine)
Takes me out of my mind
Takes me out of my mind

….so good today

Lord I feel so good (Lord I feel so good today)
Lord I feel just fine (Lord I feel so fine)
Takes me out of my mind
It takes me out of my mind

Don’t it feel so good? (Lord I feel so good today)
Don't it feel just fine? (Lord I feel so fine)
Lord I feel so good today
Lord I feel so fine, Lord…
‘Cos it feels so good (Lord I feel so good today)
Yeah it feels so fine (Lord I feel so fine)
Takes me out of my mind (Lord…)
Takes me out of my mind

…goin’ down today
Lord I ain’t goin’ down
Lord I ain’t gonna die today
Lord I ain’t gonna die

Lord I ain’t goin’ down today
Lord I feel so good today

Ba baba ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba baba ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba
Baba ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba baba ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba

Don’t it feel so good? (Lord I feel so good)
Don’t it feel so good? (Lord I feel so good today)
But don’t it feel so good? (Lord I feel so good today)
Don’t it feel just fine? (Lord I feel so fine)
Takes me out of my mind Lord I feel so good today
Takes me out of my mind Lord I feel so fine
Takes me out of my mind Lord…

Everything’s just fine
That’s just fine
Lord I ain’t goin’ down today
Lord I ain’t goin’ downEmbed
