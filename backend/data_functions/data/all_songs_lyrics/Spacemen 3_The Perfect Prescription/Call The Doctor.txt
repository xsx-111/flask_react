Call The Doctor LyricsCall the doctor pretty baby
You know I'm near to my last breath
You'd better hurry now honey
Or you're gonna be my death
You'd better throw away the spoons
And all the other dirty things
Cause when the law arrives this evening
I don't think they'll wait and ring
Call the doctor, pretty baby
Tell him he's gotta rush and run
Cause I think I've had too much babe
Tell him it ain't no fun
Hey there's the door now pretty baby
See who's on the other side
Tell them to back up with the wagon now
I think I'm going for a ride
Tell them I did it to myself babe
That I lived a life of sin
Tell them black ain't always white babe
And without sure ain't withinEmbed
