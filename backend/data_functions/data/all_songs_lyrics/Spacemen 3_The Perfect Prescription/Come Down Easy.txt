Come Down Easy Lyrics
Nineteen eighty-seven
All I want to do is fly
All I want for you to do
Is reach up to the sky

Well, well, well
Come down easy
Well, well, well
Come down easy

Lord, I'm gonna shake it
Lord, I'm gonna make it
Sure, I'm gonna take it
‘cause I feel, yeah I feel, alright, alright, alright

Nineteen eighty-seven
All I want to do is get stoned
All I want for you to do
Is take my body home

Well, well, well
Come down easy
Well, well, well
Come down easy
Lord, I'm gonna shake it
Lord, I'm gonna make it
Sure, I'm gonna take it
‘cause I feel, yeah I feel, alright, alright, alright

Meet me, children meet me
Meet me at the top of the sky
All I want for you to do
Is take yourself a little higher

Well, well, well
Come down easy
Well, well, well
Come down easy

Lord, I'm gonna shake it
Lord, I'm gonna make it
Sure, I'm gonna take it
'cause I feel, yeah I feel, alright, alright, alright

Yeah I feel alright, alright, alright
Take it down, take it way down low
Down, down, down, down, down
Take it way down low
About as low as you can go

I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, but I
I don't know, but I shake it babe
Shake it babe, shake it babe
Shake it baby, shake it babe, shake it babe
Yeah, so I can fly
Yeah, just take it a little higher now
Yeah, come down easy

Lord, I'm gonna shake it
Lord, I'm gonna make it
Sure, I'm gonna take it
'cause I feel, yeah I feel
Alright, alright, alright

Shake it babe
Jesus Christ I was only shakin', Lord
Shake it babe, Shake it baby
Shake it baby, Shake it babeEmbed
