Cherbourg Lyrics
And a fall from you
Is a long way down
I found a better way out
And a fall from you
Is a long way down
I know a better way out

Well it's been a long time
Since I've seen you smile
Gambled away my fright
Till the morning lights shine
It's been a long time
Since I've seen you smile
Gambled away my fright
Till the morning lights shine

Sunday morning
Only fog on the limbs
I called it again
What do you know
And I filled our days
With cards and gin
You're alight again, my dear
I will lead the way, oh, lead the way
When I know
And I'll sleep away, oh, sweep away
What I don't
Well seize the way, oh, seize the way
No, I won't
I will lead the way, oh, lead the day
When I know1Embed
