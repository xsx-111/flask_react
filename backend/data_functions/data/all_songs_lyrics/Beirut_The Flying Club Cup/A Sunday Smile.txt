A Sunday Smile Lyrics
All I want is the best for our lives my dear
And you know my wishes are sincere
What's to say for the days I cannot bear

A Sunday smile you wore it for a while
A cemetery mile we paused and sang
A Sunday smile you wore it for a while
A cemetery mile we paused and sang
A Sunday smile and we felt true (and)

We burnt to the ground
Left a view to admire
With buildings inside church of white
We burnt to the ground left a grave to admire
And as we reach for the sky, reach the church of white

A Sunday smile you wore it for a while
A cemetery mile we paused and sang
A Sunday smile you wore it for a while
A cemetery mile we paused and sang
A Sunday smile and we felt true7Embed
