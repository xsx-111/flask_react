Guyamas Sonora Lyrics
In the hall I heard your faints falling
Your trial and my corrections made
You had all the prayers of my loose heart
You had all the prayers of once had gone

No I was not there on the church stairs
The wind in my hair fled through night's air
No I was not there on the church stairs
The wind in my hair fled through night's air

Me I wanted, I wanted the right time
Me I wanted, I wanted the fire in line
Me I wanted, I wanted the right time
Me I wanted, I wanted the fire in line2Embed
