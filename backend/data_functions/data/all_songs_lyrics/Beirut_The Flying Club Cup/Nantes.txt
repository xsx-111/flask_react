Nantes Lyrics
Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile

Nobody raise your voices
Just another night in Nantes
Nobody raise your voices
Just another night in Nantes
...plaisanter
Oh non je t'en prie, nous ne sommes pas chez nous
Oh je t'assure que Victoire...
Non, laisse moi!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as aujourd'hui?
J'ai que les hommes me dégoûtent, vous ne pensez qu'à ça

Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile18Embed
