Alone Together  LyricsAlone together, beyond the crowd
Above the world
We're not too proud to cling together
We're strong as long as we're together
Alone together, the blinding rain
The starless nights were not in vain
For we're together
And what is there to fear together
Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If we're alone together, together, together
If we're alone together

You know, I, uh
I’d like to, um
If I’m known at all, I’m known for singing
Very sad, tragic songs 
But I like to sing in between sometimes
I do like to sing jazz and they won’t let me
I don’t know who they are but...
And we have nine man in the band who play very good jazz
 
You’re gonna see that it’s all  they only have seventeen pieces of music 
Now, are we ready?
What are we gonna sing?
Now, I lead... Have you got your sticks?
Can I get you anything else at all?
You don’t want your wallet on your little...
Do you play with that? Oh my godness-
Um, I lead, right?
What is it 1, 2, 3?Embed
