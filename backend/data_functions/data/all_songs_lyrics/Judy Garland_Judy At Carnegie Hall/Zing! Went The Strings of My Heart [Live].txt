Zing! Went The Strings of My Heart  Lyrics
Dear, when you smiled at me
I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring
I heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again?
But keep repeating through and through, "I love you, love you"
I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hope ’twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again?
But keep repeating through and through, "I love you, love you"
I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine

Zing, went the strings of my
Zing, went the strings of my
Zing, went the strings of my heartEmbed
