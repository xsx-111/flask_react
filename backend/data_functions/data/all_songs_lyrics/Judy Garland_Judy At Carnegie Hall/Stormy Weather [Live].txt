Stormy Weather  LyricsDon't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time... the time...
So weary all the time
When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away
Old rocking chair'll get me
All I do is pray
That the lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more...
Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time
I walk around heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around, and I'm still feelin' bad
Rain pourin' down, blinding every hope I had
This pitterin', patterin', beatin' and splatterin'
Dri-ives me mad!
Love! love...
Love! love...
This misery... is just... too much... for me...
Can't go on!
Everything I had is gone!
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the timeEmbed
