Medley: You Made Me Love You / For Me and My Gal / The Trolley Song  LyricsYou made me love you
I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to do it
You made me love you
And all the time you knew it, I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes, you made me glad
But most of the time, dear, you made me feel so bad
You made me sigh, 'cause
I didn't want to tell you, I didn't want to tell you
I need some love it's true, yes I do, 'deed I do, you know I do
I can't tell you what I'm feeling
The very mention of your name sends my heart reeling
You know you made me love you
The bells are ringing for me and my gal
The birds are singing for me and my gal
"Sing it with me, please!"
Everybody’s been knowing to a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing, every Susie and Sal
They're congregating for me and my gal
The parson's waiting for me and my gal
And someday we’re gonna build a little home to two
Or three or four or more
In Loveland, for me and my gal
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings
From the moment I saw him, I fell
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake
He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death
Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to leave, I took hold of his sleeve with my hand
And as if it were planned, he stayed on with me
And it was grand just to stand with his hand holding mine
To the end of the lineEmbed
