Swanee  LyricsSwanee, how I loves ya, how I loves ya
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world to be among the folks in
D-I-X-I-E-ven though my mammy's
Waiting for me, praying for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shore
Swanee, Swanee
I'm coming back to Swanee
Mammy, mammy
I love the old folks at home
I loves ya Swanee
How I loves ya, how I loves ya
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world if I could only be
Sittin' on my mammy's knee
I love the old folks, I love the young folks
*incomprehensible* … mammy, mammy
My dear old mammy
The folks up north will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shoreEmbed
