Chicago  LyricsI got the surprise, the surprise of my life
I had to stop and stare
I saw man dancing with his own wife
And you'll never guess where...
Chicago, Chicago
The toddlin' town, the toddlin' town
Chicago, Chicago
I'll see you around, I love it
Bet your bottom dollar you lose the blues in Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down
On State Street, that great street
I just wanna stay, I just wanna stay
They do things they don't do on Broadway, say
I had the time, the time of my life
I saw a man who danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago
Chicago, Chicago
Free and easy town, brassy, breezy town
Chicago, Chicago
Let me cool my heels right down at Marshall Fields
Come and walk with me along the lake to the drake
Holler and hoot, all through the loop
Shout how now to Mrs. O'Leary's cow
No she-she, life is peachy
Chicago, we'll meet at the Pump Room
Ambassador East, to say the least
On shish kebab, and breasts of squab
We will feast, and get fleece
Don't tell me sin is rampant and rife
Think of that man who danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago
I'm in a shindig in the wonderful, windy townEmbed
