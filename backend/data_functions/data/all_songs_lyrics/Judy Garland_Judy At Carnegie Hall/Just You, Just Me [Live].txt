Just You, Just Me  LyricsJust you, just me
Let’s find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
Just us, just we
I’ve missed an awful lot
My trouble is you
Oh, gee!
What are your charms for
What are my arms for
Use your imagination
Just you, just me
I’ll tie a lover’s knot
'Round wonderful you
Just you and just me
Just us and just we
Oh, gee!
What are your charms for
What are my arms for
Use your imagination
Just you, just me
I’ll tie a lover’s knot
I’ll tie a lover’s knot
'Round wonderful you
Hey!Embed
