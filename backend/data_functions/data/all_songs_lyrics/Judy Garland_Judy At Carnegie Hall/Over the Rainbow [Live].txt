Over the Rainbow  LyricsSomewhere, over the rainbow
Way up high
There’s a land that I heared of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere, over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
Someday I’ll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
Away above the chimeney tops
That’s where you’ll find me
Somewhere, over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, oh why can’t I?
If happy little blue birds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, then oh, why can’t I?Embed
