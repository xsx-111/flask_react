Who Cares? (As Long As You Care For Me)  Lyrics
1, 2..
1, 2, 3
Oh, it works

Who cares if the sky cares
To fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?
Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!
Who cares if the sky cares
To fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?
Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee
So long as I care for you
And you care, you care, baby, for me!
Now the next one is sort of a strip tease tempo
We don’t do it, we just talk about it
Uh, so, oh heck, no, not in Carnegie Hall
It wouldn’t look right at all
Somebody moans, you moan?
 I moan, Judy
Do you? Well, Lanklin, you finish moaning
What tempo?
Now moan, really moanEmbed
