How Long Has This Been Going On?  LyricsI could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years?
Listen you, tell me do:
How long has this been going on?
There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Little one, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?
Dear, when in your arms I creep
That divine rendez-vous
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep
Let me dream that it's true!
Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
Oh, I wish that I could melt;
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt
Finding another world
Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long ... has this been going ... on?Embed
