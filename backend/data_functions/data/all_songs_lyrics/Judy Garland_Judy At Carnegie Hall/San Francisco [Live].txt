San Francisco  LyricsI never will forget, Mmmm...Jeanette MacDonald
Just to think of her, it gives my heart a pang
I never will forget, how that brave Jeanette
Just stood there in the ruins and sang, and sang...
San Francisco, open your golden gate
You'll let nobody wait outside your door
San Francisco, here is your wanderin' one
Saying I'll wander no more
Other places only make me love you best
Tell me you're the one in all the golden west
San Francisco, I'm coming home again
Never to roam again...
San Francisco, right when I arrive
I really come alive...
And you will laugh to see me
Perpendicular, hanging on a cable car
San Francisco, let me beat my feet
Up and down Market Street
I'm gonna climb Nob Hill, just to watch it get dark
From the top of the mark
There's Brooklyn Bridge, London Bridge
And the Bridge of San Louis Rey
But the only bridge, that's a real gone bridge
Is the bridge accross the bay
San Francisco, I'm coming home again
Never to roam again, by gum
San Francisco, I don't mean Frisco
San Francisco, here I come!Embed
