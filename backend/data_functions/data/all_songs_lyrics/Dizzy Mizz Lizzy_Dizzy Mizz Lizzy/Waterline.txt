Waterline LyricsReally easy
You wanna know the answer
Feel me easy
You wanna know the answer
You think I've got it to my mind
And all the people think I'm blind
Really easy
You wanna know the answer
Feel me easy
You wanna know the answer
You think I've got it to my mind
And all the people think I cannot see
I hide with an unpredicted smile
She hides and she hides a little while
She don't mind
She took time
In a crime - it's just another waterline
With your head in the clouds
With my tears in the crowdEmbed
