Love Me A Little LyricsLove Me A Little
(Track 8 on "Dizzy Mizz Lizzy")
Love me a little
And I won't mind I said a go now
Shoot me a lippy
And I won't mind I said a go now
Nice little beaver
And I won't mind I said go a now
Love me a little
And I won't mind I said go a now
Love me a little
And I won't mind I said go a now
Be-bop-a-lula
And I won't mind I said go a now
Nice little squeezer
And I won't mind I said go a now
Love me a little
And I won't mind I said go a now
Down in a hole
Down in a hole
You watch your neighbor
Down in a hole
Down in a hole
You watch your neighbor
She don't mind dipping everybody in the soy
Love me a little
And I won't mind I said go a now
Roll me a reefer
And I won't mind I said go a now
Cute little teaser
And I won't mind I said go a now
Love me a little
And I won't mind I said go a now
Down in a hole
Down in a hole
You watch your neighbor
Down in a hole
Down in a hole
You watch your neighbor
She don't mind dipping everybody in the soyEmbed
