Silverflame Lyrics
Sorrow hides under the water
Sorrow is my only friend
Sorrow stands beside the doorway
And sorrow needs a helping hand

Girl in a glass box dressed in white
Happy enough to commit suicide
She said silver's meant to burn forever
Sleeping forever in a bubble of blue
Would you like to see her point of view?
She said silver's meant to burn forever
Forever

Say my name, silverflame, take control
Of my heart, of my mind, and my soul
What a shame, silverflame, you can't burn forever
Say my name, silverflame, take control
Of my heart, of my mind, and my soul
What a shame, silverflame, you can't burn forever
Forever, forever, forever

And in the garden is a cheap hotel
Only invited if your thing went well
She said silver's meant to burn forever
Sleeping forever in a bubble of blue
Would you like to see her point of view?
She said silver's meant to burn forever
Forever
Say my name, silverflame, take control
Of my heart, of my mind, and my soul
What a shame, silverflame, you can't burn forever
Say my name, silverflame, take control
Of my heart, of my mind, and my soul
What a shame, silverflame, you can't burn foreverEmbed
