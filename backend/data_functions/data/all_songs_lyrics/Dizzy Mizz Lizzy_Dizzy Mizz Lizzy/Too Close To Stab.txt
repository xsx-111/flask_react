Too Close To Stab LyricsToo Close To Stab
(Track 14 on "Dizzy Mizz Lizzy")
Lookin' out that window
For my old mind
And any way the wind blows
Any way is fine
You won't see no yellow leaves in the rain
I can't find no piece of mind in the rain
Lookin' out my window
For my old mind
And anywhere that girl goes
Any place is fine
Sittin' still so you won't kill the rain
Goin' down to psycho town in the rain
Lookin' out that window for my old mind
You cannot stab me baby when you're
Standing so close
Standing so close
Got to keep my distance
Gotta play it cool
Protecting my resistance
Ain't nobody's fool
You won't see no yellow leaves in the rain
I can't find no piece of mind in the rain
Lookin' out that window for my old mind
You cannot stab me baby when you're
Standing so close
Standing so closeEmbed
