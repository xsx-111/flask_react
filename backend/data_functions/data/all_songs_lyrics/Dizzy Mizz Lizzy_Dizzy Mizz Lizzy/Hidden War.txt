Hidden War LyricsSun has set
Very red
Wanna go all the way
So they say
See their eyes
The way they shine
Don't they say all the way
Paralyzed
Hypnotized
They can go all the way
Go today
Don't you know
You gotta show
That you can go all the way
See them go all the way
Waitin' for the hidden war
So she can go all the way
Waitin' for the hidden war
So she can go all the way
When I'm down to the ground
She will go all the way
Waitin' for the hidden war
So she can go all the way
All the way
Trapped inside this vicious circle
Watching out for a friendly fire
I keep searching for the answer
In their lies
While they smile
Who is on my side?
Children run
And jump the gun
Wanna go all the way
Like a game
Wave goodbye
Proud to die
Sure to go all the way
Carved in stone
Name unknown
Really went all the way
What a day
Formalized
And eulogized
And then they all go away
See them all slip away
Waitin' for the hidden war
So they can go all the way
Waitin' for the hidden war
So they can go all the way
And when I'm down to the ground
She will go all the way
Waitin' for the hidden war
So they can go all the way
All the way
Trapped inside this vicious circle
Watching out for a friendly fire
I keep searching for the answer
In their lies
While they smile
Who is on my side?
She can go all the way
She can go all the way
Waitin' for the hidden war
So they can go all the way
Waitin' for the hidden war
So they can go all the way
When I'm down to the ground
She will go all the way
Waitin' for the hidden war
So she can go all the way
Waitin' for the hidden war
So she can go all the way
Waitin' for the hidden war
So she can go all the way
All the way
Trapped inside this vicious circle
Watching out for a friendly fire
I keep searching for the answer
In their lies
While they smile
Who is on my side?
Waitin' for the hidden war
So I can go all the wayEmbed
