...And So Did I Lyrics...And So Did I
(Track 10 on "Dizzy Mizz Lizzy")
Little knife-edge
Took a life and so did I
Inner circle
She drove around and so did I
In my way
Live tomorrow not today
In the rain
Over and over and over again
Money's talkin'
You paid the price and so did I
Like forever
It took some time and so did I
In my way
Live tomorrow not today
In the rain
Over and over and over again
It's never enough with a heart
At a party
You looked so strange and so did I
Lonely spider
You changed your mind and so did I
In my way
Live tomorrow not today
In the rain
Over and over and over again
It's never enough with a heartEmbed
