67 Seas In Your Eyes Lyrics67 Seas In Your Eyes
(Track 6 on "Dizzy Mizz Lizzy")
Doesn't smile
Laughs loudly after a while
Don't know what this girl's about
Some surprise
What is it you're trying to hide?
Something I can't figure out
She doesn't know
Which way to go she doesn't care
But before you go
You ought to know
(that there's) 67 seas in your eyes
And now she's sad
Must be the best blow I ever had
I can't stand it anymore
And where are you?
Tell me can I go there too?
But she's halfway out the door
She doesn't know
Which way to go she doesn't care
But before you go
You ought to know
(that there's) 67 seas in your eyesEmbed
