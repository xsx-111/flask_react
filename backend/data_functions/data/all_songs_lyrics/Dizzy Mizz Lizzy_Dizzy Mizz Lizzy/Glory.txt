Glory LyricsGlory
(Track 4 on "Dizzy Mizz Lizzy")
Welcome to my inspiration
Flowers in our hair
The grass is growing high this summer
There's something in the air
BRIDGE
But I lied when I tried
And I always seem to hesitate
Could this remind you of the sixties
Or am I making a mistake?
I mean one guitar a bass and a drummer
That's really all it takes
BRIDGE
But I lied when I tried
And I always seem to hesitate
CHORUS (x2)
Something's wrong
Inside my heart
In the name of glory, yeah
She don't care too much for moonlight sun
Peace and love and understanding
Could make you feel so free
Psychedelic vision baby
Could be reality
BRIDGE
But I lied when I tried
And I always seem to hesitate
CHORUS (x2)
Something's wrong
Inside my heart
In the name of glory, yeah
She don't care too much for moonlight sun
