Wishing Well LyricsShe said it's beautiful
On the inside out
She said it's beautiful
With a silent shout
Take her by the hand
And you'll understand
I wish you well
She said it's beautiful
With a wishing well
She said it's beautiful
In an angel's room
She said that contradiction
Will bring you doom
Take her by the hand
And you'll understand
I wish you well
She said it's beautiful
With a wishing wellEmbed
