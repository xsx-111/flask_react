Bite the Bullet LyricsThere's a bar hall queen down in Charlotte town (Bite the bullet)
I'd sure like to see her when the sun goes down (Bite the bullet)
I swear her hair is midnight black (Bite the bullet)
And I can't wait 'til I get back (Bite the bullet)
Carolina queen
She's a walking love machine
I'd like to make her scream
When I bite the bullet, bite the bullet
Born and raised at the top of the South (Bite the bullet)
You know she knows what it's all about (Bite the bullet)
Good old boys are coming from miles around (Bite the bullet)
Want to watch that bullet lay 'em down (Bite the bullet)
Carolina queen
She's a walking love machine
I'd like to make her scream
When I bite the bullet, bite the bullet
Bite the bullet, bite the bullet
There's a bar hall queen down in Charlotte town (Bite the bullet)
I'd sure like to see her when the sun goes down (Bite the bullet)
Good old boys are coming from miles around (Bite the bullet)
Want to watch that bullet lay 'em down (Bite the bullet)
Carolina queen
She's a walking love machine
I'd like to make her scream
When I bite the bullet, bite the bullet
Bite the bullet, bite the bulletEmbed
