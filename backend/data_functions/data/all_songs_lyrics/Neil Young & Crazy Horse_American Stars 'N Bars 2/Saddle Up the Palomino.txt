Saddle Up the Palomino LyricsOh, oh, Carmelina
The daughter of the wealthy banker
Since she came to town, all my friends are gone
And I'm stuck out here with melody
Saddle up the palomino
The sun is going down
The way I feel
This must be real
If you can't cut it
Don't pick up the knife
There's no reward in your conscience stored
When you're sleeping with another man's wife
Saddle up the palomino
The sun is going down
The way I feel
This must be real
I want to lick the platter
The gravy doesn't matter
It's a cold bowl of chili when love lets you down
But it's the neighbor's wife I'm after
Saddle up the palomino
The sun is going down
The way I feel
This must be realEmbed
