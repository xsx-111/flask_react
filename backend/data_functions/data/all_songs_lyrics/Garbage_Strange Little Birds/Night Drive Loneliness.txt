Night Drive Loneliness Lyrics
Lonely
Lonely

I got my high heels and my lipstick
My blue velvet dress in my closet
Got my phone on vibrate
All I do is wait

My night drive loneliness
Comes again and again
My night drive loneliness
Comes again and again

Of those stupid things that I've said
There's one thing I regret
In the moment that I said it, I wanted to kill it
I still feel sick about it

My night drive loneliness
Comes again and again
My night drive loneliness
Comes again and again
Lonely
Lonely
I'm so nervous
Like a cat on a hot tin roof and
I want to get wasted
Forget all about it
Like the blue dress in my closet
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again

My night drive loneliness
Comes again and again (my loneliness)
My night drive loneliness
Comes again and again (my loneliness)
(Loneliness)
My night drive loneliness
Comes again and again (my loneliness)
My night drive loneliness
Comes again and again (my loneliness)
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Loneliness
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Loneliness
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Loneliness
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Loneliness
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone1Embed
