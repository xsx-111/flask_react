We Never Tell Lyrics
This is my time with you, I'm not giving it back
They could break our arms but we will remain intact
Youâ€™d never had anyone make you feel so good
I can see it in your eyes when I look at you

It's in our eyes but we never tell
It's in our eyes but we never tell
It's in our eyes but we never tell
That I want you, ooh
I want you, I want you
I know you want me too

We're on the outside always looking in
You don't trust humans and I feel the same

It's in our eyes but we never tell
It's in our eyes but we never tell
It's in our eyes but we never tell
That I want you, ooh
I want you, I want you
I know you want me too
Let's give 'em something to remember
Something to talk about
On their telephones
On their couch at home
Make me shake, make me tremble
We can be animals
Our secret universe, a place to be us

This is my time with you, I'm not giving it back
They could break our arms but we will remain intact

It's in our eyes but we never tell
It's in our eyes but we never tell
It's in our eyes but we never tell
It's in our eyes but we never tell
It's in our eyes but we never tell
It's in our eyes but we never tell
It's in our eyes but we never tell

Let's give 'em something to remember
Something to talk about
Let's give 'em something to remember
Something to talk aboutEmbed
