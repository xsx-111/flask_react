So We Can Stay Alive Lyrics
Imagine this: we make things right
So beautiful, we cling tonight
To all our dreams, we pin them up
We lose our minds if we lose our hope
We swear to change, but we bottle it
Stick to our guns and all our sins
We bury fear, we drink to it
We might cheat death if we worship it

So we can stay alive
Our sex, our power, our drive
We lose ourselves inside
So we can feel alive

You're the one who should be on trial
For all your hate and your denial
Be careful what it is you break
Every broken thing can't be fixed
And all those fragile things we are
They find their voice, they find their power
They take a grip around your throat
They keep squeezing till your life runs out
So we can stay alive
Our sex, our power, our drive
We lose ourselves inside
So we can feel alive

(Masochistic victim sadist
Victor vanquish valour sadness
Lust and love, our lives, our blindness)
(We can feel alive)
All alone we fight the fear
By ourselves in every way
(We can feel alive)
All our lust, all our greed
All our hate, we're on our knees
(We can feel)
Hear us beg, hear us pray

We can stay alive
We can stay alive
We can stay alive
We can stay alive
We can stay alive
We can stay alive1Embed
