Sometimes Lyrics
Sometimes I'd rather take a beating
Sometimes I'd rather take a punch
I learn more when I am bleeding
You knock me down, then I get up

Sometimes I need to forgive you
Sometimes I want to destroy
Sometimes I know it was not your fault
But I blame you anyway

Sometimes I don't like to quarrel
Sometimes I feel too afraid
Sometimes I know I'm not meant to do it
I do it anyway

Sometimes I feel so jealous
Sometimes I feel insecure
Sometimes I feel like I vanished in thin air
Sometimes I feel I'm not here1Embed
