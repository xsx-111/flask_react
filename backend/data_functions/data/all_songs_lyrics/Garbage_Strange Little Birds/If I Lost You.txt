If I Lost You Lyrics
There are times when I see you talking to other girls
I feel insecure
And every time I see you walking out
I wonder if you're coming back to me
You tell me I've got nothing to worry about
They've got nothing on me
You tell me I'm a good girl and you know it
Are you so strong, or is the weakness in me?

I've never had someone like you
Who makes me feel the way you do
Sometimes I believe that I might die
If I lost you
If I lost you
If I lost you

Fears formed so long ago
So stupid to hold on to them all
Not every man is made the same
So unevolved to think that way

But I've never had someone like you
Who makes me feel the way you do
Sometimes I believe that I might die
If I lost you
If I lost you
If I lost you

I've never had someone like you
Who makes me feel the way you do
Sometimes I believe that I might die
If I lost you
If I lost you
If I lost you
If I lost you1Embed
