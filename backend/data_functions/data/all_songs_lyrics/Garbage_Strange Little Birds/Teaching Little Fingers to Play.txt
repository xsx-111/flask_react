Teaching Little Fingers to Play Lyrics
I was young and naive
All I wanted to do was please, please, please
But things, they change
And I'm a big girl now

I'm all grown up (I'm all grown up)
No one around to fix me now (There's no one around)
So doing it my own way (I'm doing it, I'm doing it)
I'm changing things up like I'm teaching little fingers to play

I've worn myself out for you
Shiny and keen for you
But things, they change
And I'm a big girl now (I'm a big girl)

I'm all grown up (I'm all grown up)
No one around to fix me now (There's no one around)
So doing it my own way (I'm doing it, I'm doing it)
I'm changing things up like I'm teaching little fingers to play

Nothing ever stays the same
Youth and beauty don't remain
The wise, they say: "adapt or die"
If you don't grow, you'll calcify
But you're too scared to try
But things, they change (they change and)
And I'm a big girl now (I'm a big girl)
I'm all grown up
There's no one around to fix me now
I'm all grown up
There's no one around to fix me now
I'm doing it my own way (I'm doing it, I'm doing it)
Doing it my own way (I'm doing it, I'm doing it)
Doing it my own way (I'm doing it, I'm doing it)
I'm changing things up like I'm teaching little fingers to playEmbed
