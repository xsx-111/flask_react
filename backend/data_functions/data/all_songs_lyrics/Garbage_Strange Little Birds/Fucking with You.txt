Fucking with You Lyrics
You left me black and blue bruises
You cheated on me with lots of girls
Always from behind, in public places
So you didn't have to look into their face
You said there was no one quite like me
Coming inside me felt like coming home
I was so naive, it made me feel like a queen
Such is the ego of the young

But fucking with you was always fun
Fucking with you was always fun

I want you to know I will always love you
I need you to know I forgive you
I want you to know that I was also to blame
I was never easy to live with back then

Fucking with you was always fun
Fucking with you was always fun

And if I could, I wouldn't leave
And I'd do the same again
Fucking with you was always fun
Fucking with you was always fun
Fucking with you was always fun
Fucking with you was always funEmbed
