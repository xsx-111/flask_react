Under Serious Attack LyricsYou've taken this too far
Now it has to stop
You've taken this too far
Once again, the table's turned and I'm behind
Picking up the pieces from the night
My face is scarred
Sometimes I feel that I can't trust myself at all
Every time the sky
Breaks open with sunshine
And streaming swords collide
It takes me back in time
I float away
To another place
Where heaven is waiting right outside
This is war
Can I take it anymore?
I'm falling faster and bleeding more then I have bled before
Certain death (this blade will carve a purpose)
Lingers on the other hand (and make you feel defeated)
But I will fight you and victory will be mine in the end
Circumstances mean nothing
When it's over we will be heroes
Constantly pushing forward without any fear
If I erased the line between
Forgotten days and memories
I'd never change
Resolutions made (in vain) to face (play out) the day
Life is yours to save (save it) or take (take it) awayEmbed
