Bloodless LyricsTake me (far from all the wrongs)
Let these (fears collapse inside)
Take me (back to when I)
Believed
And as a little boy they tried to hide his eyes
With reeds and rituals. The paper and the knife
But fire will always burn through skin and forgery
And answer when you won't, the bloodless hands of fear
He didn't know
He didn't know
He didn't know
He didn't know
He didn't know
He was hungry
Didn't know
Didn't know
Didn't know
Didn't know
Didn't know
He was hungry
Someone had a knife and took away my eyes
The last time is right now
This choice will take or make everything
Your face is fading out
Wash those days from your eyes
And let them fall away
Drown the fears that own you
Wash those days from your eyes
And let them fall away
Drown the fears
He felt the wake of torrid days
Ushered through by warm mistakes
Suddenly his broken feet
Took their rest on bended knee
He didn't know
Didn't know
Didn't know
Didn't know
Didn't know
He was hungry
Didn't know
Didn't know
Didn't know
Didn't know
Didn't know
He was hungry
He was hungry
Someone had a knife and took away my eyes
The last time is right now
This choice will take or make everything
Your face is fading out
I won't stand here
This dance won't stop the music
Your promise will help me lead
Until the end
What words have you to say
(If this is the last time, I won't forget you)
Before we spill
(exhale the last breathe, tear down the statue)
This blood?
(this scar will remain here to mark where we've severed)
This time you will be afraid
(my life from your hands)
You have lost me, your plans failed
(your hands from my heart)
This is the last timeEmbed
