The Note From Which A Chord Is Built LyricsYou have always seen the best part of me
With my uncovered eyes
Loose from lenses, absorbing light
Your hand is wrapped in mine
The sun set for the last time
Carpet stains from coffee cups
Thrown to stop from hurting so much
Paralyzed I thought I'd fail
You somehow, and let you down
But you saved me from death
We came alive for the first time
Joining as voices sing, together
The same songEmbed
