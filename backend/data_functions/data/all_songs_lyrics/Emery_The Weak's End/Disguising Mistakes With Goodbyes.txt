Disguising Mistakes With Goodbyes LyricsJust take it back (I feel)
They're only words (your hair)
We hold the tethers (through my)
We're here together (fingers)
We paint the night (every)
Only to find (silk strand)
It's cracked and peeling (takes my)
Each face revealing (breath a-)
What we don't say (-way)
Let's take these lines and
Draw ourselves out of here
This shipwreck
From set-sail
We'll map the stars
Tonight they help to find a way
When all is said
Words can breathe more life than death
The innocence that people share
Touching on secrets and letting down hair
Over and over let's not forget last time
I've kept the best parts and play them in my mind
This is tomorrow so take it or leave it
Empty diaries
There's nothing to say
And we'll take the right steps
To keep these pages clean
You want the answers
I see them on your face
You need to know this is where the promise breaks
I can give you my answer
I can give you my answer
I can give you my answer
I can give you my answer
I know (I know)
If you stay (if you stay)
This will be (this will)
Ours to take (be ours to take)
Inside I (I feel)
Am overwhelmed (so good)
From holding back (I want)
But know that this won't be forever (you for all my days, but tonight...)
I can't stay here
You can't ask me
Just so you would knowEmbed
