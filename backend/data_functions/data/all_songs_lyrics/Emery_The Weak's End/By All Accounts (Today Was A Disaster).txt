By All Accounts (Today Was A Disaster) LyricsWasted, paralyzed
Beneath ten thousand layers of disguise
Built to save
What's left that has already worn away
Inside this vacant made-up plastic life
Only your heart survived
For one last cry
One last cry
One last cry
How long (must I always remember)
Until (all that I want to forget)
It's my day (my day)
To die
These broken animals
Useless as they are
These broken animals
As useless as they are
These broken animals
As useless as they are
Gravity gets to me
Holds me here
Without release
Now's the time
To cut the line
Cross my heart
I realize
Nights are long
And hope is gone
God help me
Make it home
Make it home
You
Make it home
This time
Yeah
You
