Fractions LyricsOne and three, you are here
(One and three, you're here)
To tell me we can't do this
(To tell me we can't do this)
Three for three, I'll disagree
Anymore
Your hair and face against the mirror
As I take the steps to save what's left of me
Someone's out when it's over
People steal from you
And they take anything they choose
It's good to see you
I missed you last night
That's such a lovely color
It goes with your eyes
Before we fall asleep
I just wanted to say
This all seems so easy
But there's choices to make
Can't decide, then look at the faces
(Candlelight)
We're burning the pages
(Ask us why)
And hurting ourselves with this false start
(Resign yourself)
And we pretend (and always be)
It simply gets easier (Without the one)
But it doesn't get easier (thing you need)
(Reading words with no replies)
When we have these mornings where we can't say goodbye
I wanted to mean everything to you
But this isn't right
You keep coming back disassembled and I
Keep losing this fight
I won't answer...
Dancing under starlight glow
No one in the city knows
Confidence can take you
Nerves try to shake you
From going all the way
It's not that far...
It's good to see you
I missed you last night
That's such a lovely color
It goes with your eyes
Before we fall asleep
I just wanted to say
This all seems so easy
But there's choices to make
We watch the tide roll in
With cold air and coffeecakes
Holding our words at lips
Stopping the sounds they make
We know the way to go
We know each step to take
To be here
These words with no replies
Stopping we's, starting I's
This need is killing me
And taking me over
I wanted to mean everything to you
But this isn't right
You keep coming back disassembled and I
Keep losing this fightEmbed
