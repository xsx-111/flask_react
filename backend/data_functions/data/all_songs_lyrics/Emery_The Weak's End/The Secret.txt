The Secret LyricsOn the way to grey
I could hardly wait
To see you again
To feel your hands
Covering me
'Til the storm is done
What seemed to be the end
Was not the end at all
When I hear the rain
Should I be afraid
For my, for my
For my... life
Why do you look at me that way?
I told you
That I was too busy to see you
I would never
Keep a secret from you
From you
From you
Is it over?
I am fine
Thank you dearly
For your time
I'll be leaving
Don't you cry
I'll be back soon
At least I'll try
Can't you see
There is no time to think
Selfishly
Yesterday's gone
Tomorrow's here
Can't turn back now
I won't quit
I still love you
I swear
I always willEmbed
