Walls Lyrics
Are you listening?
We write a thousand pages, they're torn and on the floor
Headlights hammer the windows, we're locked behind these doors
And we are never leaving, this place is part of us
And all these scenes repeating are cold to the touch

My hands seem to deceive me when I'm nervous or when I'm
Healthy, the scenery's all drawn
They hang here from the walls dear, painting pictures, bleeding
Colors, blanket the windows

Sometimes it gets so hard to breathe
Your eyes see right through me

These fights with your arms left beside
It's one thing, and one more says goodnight
You've got the map, come get to me
These knuckles break before they bleed
Tear out these veins that own my heart
This skin that wears your lasting marks
I've built these walls, come get to me
Come get to me
Is this your lesson, a slight discretion, the lines that keep you, the
Lines that sweep you, lock the doors from the inside
Your face is so contagious, it wears announcements, it leaves me
Breathless, I won't forget this, I won't forget

Sometimes it gets so hard to breathe
Your eyes see right through me

Let the walls have their say
Let the walls have their say
Let the walls have their say
Let the walls have their say
Let the walls have their say
Have their say

There's no conversation, words without remorse
And this television drowns the only source
Wake from these dreams of you in my arms
To the staircase where you hold my heart

This place, these walls mean everything to me1Embed
