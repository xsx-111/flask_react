I was born on the day the music died
In essence and in excellence
You can get it any time so yes but unless
You can ride downtown and stay warm by the fire



I was born on the day the music died
In essence and in excellence
You can get it any time so yes but unless
You can ride downtown and stay warm by the fire
I know where to go but I don't know where to stand
Moving in boredom and I'm sitting around
You can hop on down and stay warm by the fire
I was born on the day the music diedEmbed
