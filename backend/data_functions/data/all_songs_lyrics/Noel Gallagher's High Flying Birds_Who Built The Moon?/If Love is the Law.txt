If Love is the Law Lyrics
Here am I
I’m high up on a ledge
I’m standing on the edge of night
In a lonesome town
Where love has been and gone
I’m waiting for the storm to come back
And take me down
The things I left unsaid
Were lying on the bed
Right next to the face you wore
When you left me on my one
Now I’ve up here on my own
And I must say...

I didn’t come here to make up your mind
I do believe that you were wasting my time
There’s no more tears left to cry myself blind
If love is the law
Then this is a crime

Memories
Forever set in stone
When all is said and done
They’re just like the fallen leaves
That you gather in your head
When the sun’s about to set
I sail out on stormy seas
But I cannot find the shore
Can’t hear you anymore
And there’s nothing left for me
I'm lying broken on the glass
And the ship’s about to crash
And I must say...
I didn’t come here to make up your mind
I do believe that you were wasting my time
There’s no more tears left to cry myself blind
If love is the law
Then this is a crime


I didn’t come here to make up your mind
I do believe that you were wasting my time
There’s no more tears left to cry myself blind
If love is the law
Then this is a crime

I didn’t come here to make up your mind
I do believe that you were wasting my time
There’s no more tears left to cry myself blind
If love is the law
Then this is a crime2Embed
