Holy Mountain Lyrics
Dance dance, if you do that dance
I'm gonna let you join my one man band
Be my doll, be my baby doll
Come get to know me like the back of your hand
I like the name hanging on that chain
I like the way you do the push and the shove
You can blow my mind if you're that way inclined
All that I know is that you fell from above

She fell, she fell, right under my spell
Oh now pretty baby c'mon
She danced, she danced, right into my hands
Oh now pretty baby c'mon
Be my butterfly
You and I will shake it
We can roll in at the top of them all
And if you feel the need
I'll send you Godspeed
To meet your maker at the break of the dawn
Get out of the doldrums baby, now
You liar, I'll set ya' on fire
Get out of the doldrums baby, now
Do your thing on the beat of the bang
I'll put a melody inside of your head
No need to shout, what you bitchin' about?
I think those things are better left unsaid
She had a look you won’t find in no book
And she smelt like 1969
You can blow my mind if you’re that way inclined
All I know is I’m gonna make you mine

She fell, she fell, right under my spell
Oh now pretty baby c'mon
She danced, she danced, right into my hands
Oh now pretty baby c'mon
Be my butterfly
You and I will shake it
We can roll in at the top of them all
And if you feel the need
I'll send you Godspeed
To meet your maker at the break of the dawn
Get out of the doldrums baby, now
You liar, I'll set ya' on fire
Get out of the doldrums baby, now
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell
She fell, she fell, right under my spell3Embed
