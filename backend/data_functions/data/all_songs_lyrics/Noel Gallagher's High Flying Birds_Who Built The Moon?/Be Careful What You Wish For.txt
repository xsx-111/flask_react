Be Careful What You Wish For Lyrics

(?Chicka-bow?)

Tidy your books up
Put them under your bed
And gather your thoughts up
But keep 'em in your head
Be careful what you wish for
Be careful what you dream
They let you sing your songs, son
But they’ll never hear you scream

Button your coat up
Take shelter from the rain
They want you to be like them
But you can never be the same
’Cause you’re standing on the outside
They’ll never let you in
They’ll let you play the game, son
But they’ll never let you win

Never let them bare witness
To the tears in your eyes
And never take a handshake
From the prophets and their lies
’Cause they put you in the wrong line
You’ve been crying out for more
They’ve given you the key, son
But you’ll never find the door
You’ve fallen like an angel
Stranded on the earth
They let you see their riches
They never tell you what you’re worth
They’ve put you in the back seat
While they’re heading for the sun
And if you’re waiting for the rapture
The day will never come
The day will never come...
The day will never come...
The day will never come...
The day will never come...
The day will never come...
The day will never come...
The day will never come...
The day will never come...
The day will never come...
The day will never come...3Embed
