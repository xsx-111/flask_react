Keep On Reaching Lyrics
Keep on running down that long black road
You'll find sunshine and showers made with love to behold
But can you keep a secret
Can you keep a secret
Keep on reaching up for that higher ground
But don't keep on preaching out for that book you found
Can you keep a secret
Can you keep a secret

I can play it on an old guitar
You can sing it like a monkey man
Don't speak of soul 'cause you've got none
And all the kids in a funky bar
Dressing down like a bogeyman
If they don't mind and you don't mind
I'm gonna write that in a song

But can you keep a secret
But can you keep a secret
(Keep on reaching up for that higher ground)
But can you keep a secret
(Keep on reaching up for that higher ground)
Can you keep a secret
(Keep on reaching up for that higher ground)
Can you keep a secret
(Keep on reaching up for that higher ground)
On the cover of a magazine
You wore a face that I've seldom seen
You spilled your guts but you've got none
You drive 'round in a beat up car
That you found by the road you run
If they don't mind and you don't mind
I'm gonna write that in a song

But can you keep a secret
But can you keep a secret
But can you keep a secret
Can you keep a secret
(Keep on reaching up for that higher ground)
Can you keep a secret
(Keep on reaching up for that higher ground)
Can you keep a secret
(Keep on reaching up for that higher ground)
Can you keep a secret
(Keep on reaching up for that higher ground)
(Keep on reaching up for that higher ground)2Embed
