The Man Who Built the Moon Lyrics
She was there
Diamonds in her hair
Singing out a dead man’s song
Here am I
With the mighty and the high
Feeling like I don’t belong
There’s you  in your book of who's who
Acting like you just don’t care
We were lying low
Got nowhere to go
And any road will get us there
We never should've left town in the first place
Now we gotta walk like they talk in the rat race
You keep your eyes on the prize if you want it all

You and I
The spider and the fly
Will meet where the shadows fall

Make room for the man who built the moon
He arrived on a knackered horse
Made no sound from the day he left town
No one said a word of course
I believe he was wearing on his sleeve
A heart made of black and stone
I said, my love
I think I’ve had enough
I’m gonna find my way back home
We never should have left town in the first place
Now we gotta walk like they talk in the rat race
Keep your eyes on the prize if you want it all

You and I
The spider and the fly
Will meet where the shadows fall

We never should have left town in the first place
Now we gotta walk like they talk in the rat race
Keep your eyes on the prize if you want it all

You and I
The spider and the fly
Will meet where the shadows fall

You and I
The spider and the fly
Will meet where the shadows fall3Embed
