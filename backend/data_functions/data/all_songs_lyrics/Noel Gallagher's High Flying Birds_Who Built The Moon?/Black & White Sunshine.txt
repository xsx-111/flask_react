Black & White Sunshine Lyrics
Here in the jungle
I can’t get a break for love nor money
The weight of the world
Is dragging me down down down
The heat in the bubble
She’s coming down on everybody
You better get up
Before the sun goes down

I get to slip my skin
When my ship came in
What a day now!
I feel as right as rain
But I forgot your name
Qu’est-ce que c’est now?
These are the glory days
For the waifs and the strays
You give me love
I give you thanks and praise

All the way now!
What a day now!
Don’t let me throw it away!
You got the nerve
I got the brains
We got them crawling up and down
On their hands and their knees

She is my witness
My baby say you’ll do the shake for money?
When the weight of the world
Is dragging you down down down
Near in the distance
I see you stumble when the road is rocky
You better get up
Before the sun goes down

I get to slip my skin
When my ship came in
What a day now!
I feel as right as rain
But I forgot your name
Qu’est-ce que c’est now?
These are the glory days
For the waifs and the strays
You give me love
I give you thanks and praise
All the way now!
What a day now!
Don’t let me throw it away!

You got the nerve
I got the brains
We got them crawling up and down
On their hands and their kneesEmbed
