She Taught Me How To Fly Lyrics
The one I love
The one I love
She's divine
She’s out to blow my mind
The one I love
The one I love
She's divine
She’s out to blow my-my-my mind

The one I love
The one I love
She taught me to fly
She taught me how to fly
The one I love
The one I love
She taught me to fly
She raised me up now I can fly

So put your money where your mouth is
If you know where to draw the line
Doesn't matter what your name is
I see you round all the time
You lost your mind and your make-up
I think you lost your money too
I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause all the roads I run are coming back to you
And I don't mind if you won't mind
'Cause all the roads I run are coming back to you
The one I love
The one I love

So put your money where your mouth is
If you know where to draw the line
Doesn’t matter if your face fits
I see you 'round all the time
You lost your mind and your make-up
I think you lost your money too
But I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause all the roads I run are coming back to you

The one I love
The one I love
She is divine
She’s out to blow my mind
The one I love
The one I love
She taught me to fly
She raised me up now I can fly

So put your money where your mouth is
If you know where to draw the line
Doesn’t matter what your faith is
I see you praying all the time
You lost your mind and your make-up
I think you lost your money too
And I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause all the roads I run are coming back to you
And I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause all the roads I run are coming back to you
The one I love
The one I love
The one I love
The one I love3Embed
