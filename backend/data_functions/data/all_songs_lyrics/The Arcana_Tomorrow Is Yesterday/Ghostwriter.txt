Ghostwriter Lyrics
I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter, I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter …

I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter, expect to see me at your door
And with my typewriter, I’ll make you money and then more
I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter, if you want to put your mind to bed
It’s going to be an all-nighter, I can always make up things instead

I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter, I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter …

I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter, I’ve come to save your face again
But if you think you’re brighter, you can always try to buy my pen
It’s your friendly ghostwriter, you must have heard of me before
I can make you seem nicer, be careful not to go too far

I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter, I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter …
I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter, I’m tomorrow’s ghostwriter (fade out)3Embed
