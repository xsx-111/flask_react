Fallen Bird Lyrics
Fallen bird, won’t you sing
Lift your head and try to spread your wings to fly
But don’t go too far
Remember where you are
Don’t pack your love away and tie it up with string
Open up, let me hear you sing, fallen bird

Can you breathe and is it clear
Have all your worries disappeared
Are you warm and snuggled tight
Before the cold wind starts to bite

Fallen bird, look in my eyes
See my face there’s no disguise to strip away
Float me on the air
I don’t possess a care
Lead me over mountain tops and pastures wide and green
Silent streams, and wide ravines, fallen bird

Can you breathe and is it clear
Have all your worries disappeared
Are you warm and snuggled tight
Before the cold wind starts to bite
Don’t pack your love away and tie it up with string
Open up, let me hear you sing, fallen bird1Embed
