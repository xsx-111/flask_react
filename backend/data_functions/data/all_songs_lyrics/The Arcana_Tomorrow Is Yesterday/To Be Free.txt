To Be Free Lyrics
The Sun is rising but there’s no surprise
I see the learning in the girl’s eyes
The watchful maker sends his supernal guide
To watch for those who want to adore his might

And you know, she’s the one who needs no reason
For her life, her life has taken it away
She spends her time gathering information
So one day she will have the knowledge to be free

One day a silver lining comes upon your sky
You could live forever, if you want to try
You now I’m feeling something
I never thought I’d ever be with you and to be free

All I ask in dreams for is very hard to find
Lightning strikes my windows and darkness fills my mind
You now I’m feeling something
I never thought I’d ever be with you and to be free

The Sun has risen but there’s no surprise
I still see learning in the girl’s eyes
The watchful maker still sends supernal guides
To watch for those who want to scorn it’s might
And you know, were the one who needs no reason
For our lives, our lives has taken it away
We spend our time gathering information
So one day we will have the knowledge to be free
To be free
To be free
To be free1Embed
