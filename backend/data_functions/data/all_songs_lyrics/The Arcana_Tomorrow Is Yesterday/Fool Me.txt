Fool Me Lyrics
I said love you you’ve got it
Come on come on come on
Baby you’ve got it now

People try to fool me tell me all about it
People try to fool me baby hey tell me all about it

I said how about it
Come on come on come on
Wanna pull me out of it

People try to fool me tell me all about it
People try to fool me baby hey tell me all about it
People try to fool me tell me all about it
People try to fool me baby hey tell me all about it

People try to fool me
People try to fool me
People try to fool me baby hey
People try to fool me
People try to fool me
People try to fool me baby hey1Embed
