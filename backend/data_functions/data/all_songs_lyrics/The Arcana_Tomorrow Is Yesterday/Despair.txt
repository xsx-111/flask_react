Despair Lyrics
Won’t you leave me alone
(We’re coming for you)
Can’t I be on my own
(Do you like it in blue)
No more smiling, social climbing, driving me to despair
Despair

Hold on tight for the show
(Are you felling alright)
Leave me here let me go
(can I get you a light)
Too much prying, night time flying, driving me to despair
Despair


Can you see where I’ve gone
(Is the money all here)
No more joining the throng
(Are we getting too near)
Fear of dying, lifetime sighing, driving me to despair
