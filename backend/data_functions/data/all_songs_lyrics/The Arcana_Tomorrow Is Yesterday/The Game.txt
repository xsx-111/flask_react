The Game Lyrics
I've finally realised, I've opened my mind up to the fact
The way I really live is just a put on it,s only an act

I was happy with the game that we all played
But it ended up the same, I'm fading away

Too many people wanted the clown to fall on his back
When the cards were down, I should have known to shuffle the pack

I was happy with the game that we all played
But it ended up the same, I'm fading away

I was happy with the game that we all played
But it ended up the same, I'm fading away
Yes, it ended up the same, I'm going today

I've finally realised, I've opened my mind up to the fact
The way I really live is just a put on it's only an act
Yes, it's only an act, yes it's only an act1Embed
