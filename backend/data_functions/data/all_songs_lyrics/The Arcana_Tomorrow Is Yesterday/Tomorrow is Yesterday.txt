Tomorrow is Yesterday Lyrics
I feel tomorrow is yesterday there’s no escape for me today tell me, I don’t know
You always brushing your long blonde hair making waves in the air tell me, I don’t know

Maybe one day you’ll find the time rushing through your mind
Still I will wait a while feelings may untwine is life unkind, tell me I don’t know

See I am holding out my hand so you’ll understand tell me, I don’t know
Run let your spirit wander free they’ll be no more you and me tell me, I don’t know

Maybe one day you’ll find the time rushing through your mind
Still I will wait a while feelings may untwine is life unkind, tell me I don’t know

Cut all the ribbons from your hair now you are here, but I am there tell me, I don’t know
There paradise I hope will loom happiness have I found in Jun tell me, I don’t know2Embed
