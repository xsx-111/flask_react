Looking Out For You Lyrics
You never worry and you never hurry
Is there anybody looking out for you

Train is waiting and your back is breaking
And the pavement’s trying to take it out on you

And your room is in the air where there’s time to pull out all your hair
And the man who lives downstairs doesn’t smile at you but only glares
A ha ha ha

You wake up tired with your head on fire
And your pretty pictures looking back at you

The satisfaction of your new found passion
Did you know tomorrow morning brings you nothing new

And your room is in the air where there’s time to pull out all your hair
And the man who lives downstairs doesn’t smile at you but only glares
A ha ha ha2Embed
