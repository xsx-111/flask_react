Sometimes Lyrics
Sometimes I like to feel that I’m at home
Sometimes I need to be with you alone
Through my life so many people try
Then they wave goodbye to the world

Sometimes I need to watch the snow falling lightly
Sometimes I need to know you’re here beside me
Streets that spoke to me before say nothing anymore
They speak to me from afar


Sometimes I question things that I may be doing
Sometimes I feel that I’m alive I’m flowing
Though I’ve gone I know it won’t be long
Before I say hello to the world1Embed
