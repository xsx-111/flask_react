Little Doll (Original John Cale Mix) LyricsThe little doll I can't forget
Smoking on a cigarette
In my life a real queen
Prettiest thing I ever seen, uh huh
You're the one who makes me sing
Bring happiness in everything
You're the only real one
A real way to have some fun, uh huh
But I don't know you little doll
But I don't know you little doll
Come on shake, come on shake
Come on shake you little doll
Shake you little doll
Come on shake, come on shake
Come on shake you little dollEmbed
