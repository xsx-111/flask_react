No Fun (Full Version) LyricsNo fun my babe
No fun
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun to hang around
Feelin' that same old way
No fun to hang around
Freaked out for another day
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun to be alone
Walking by myself
No fun to be alone
In love with somebody else
Well maybe go out, maybe stay home
Maybe call Mom on the telephone
Well c'mon, well c'mon
C'mon c'mon
Now Ron, I say Ron
C'mon an lemme hear you tell em
Lemme hear you tell em
Now I feel
I say lemme hear you
Tell em how I feel, yeah, my man
No fun to be alone
It's no fun to be alone
Hang on
Don't you lemme go
It's no fun to be alone
To be aloneEmbed
