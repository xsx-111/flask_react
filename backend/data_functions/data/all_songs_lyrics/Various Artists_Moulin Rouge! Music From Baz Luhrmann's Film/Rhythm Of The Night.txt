Rhythm Of The Night Lyrics
I believe you were expecting me

And it's called the Moulin Rogue

Let's dance

To the beat of the rhythm of the night
(To the rhythm)
Forget about the worries on your mind
(On your mind)
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
(To the rhythm)
Forget about the worries on your mind
(Ooh)
When it feels like
The world is on your shoulders
And all of the madness
Has got you goin' crazy
It's time to get out
Step out into the street
Where all of the action
Is right there at your feet
Well, I know a place where we can
Dance the whole night away
And it's called the Moulin Rogue
Just come with me and we can
Shake your blues right away
You'll be doin' fine once the music starts, oh yeah!
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
We can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh, the rhythm of the night
Forget about the worries on your mind
We can leave them all behind
Oh lalalalala
Oh lala
Look out on the street now
The party's just beginning
The music's playing
A celebration's starting
Under the street lights
The scene is being set
A night for romance
A night you won't forget, so
Come join the fun
This ain't no time to be staying home
The Moulin Rogue is going on, yeah!
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long...
Oh!
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
We can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh, the rhythm of the night
Forget about the worries on your mind
We can leave them all behind

Cuando sientes que el mundo
Está encima de tí
Y la vida te tienes como loca
Conozco un lugar
Donde podemos bailar

And it's called the Moulin Rogue!
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
(To the rhythm)
Forget about the worries on your mind
(On your mind)
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
(To the rhythm)
Forget about the worries on your mind
We can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Yeah, yeah
Forget about the worries on your mind
Leave it all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh, the rhythm of the night
Forget about the worries on your mind
We can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh, every night
Forget about the worries on your mind
Tonight, yeah
Oh, we can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Leave 'em, leave 'em
Forget about the worries on your mind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh, this night
Forget about the worries on your mind
Ah ah, yeah
Oh baby, wanna feel the rhythm?Embed
