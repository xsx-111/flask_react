Sparkling Diamonds Lyrics
The French are glad to die for love

A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand, but it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you feed your, mrow, pussy cat
Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

Tiffany!
Cartier!
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl *blow kiss*
Come and get me, boys
Whoo
Black, Starr, Ross Cole
Talk to me, Harry Zidler, tell me all about it!

There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
(But diamonds are a girl's best friend)
There may come a time when a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're (awful nice)
Oooo, but get that ice or else no dice!
He's your guy when stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend
Diamonds are a girl's best
Diamonds are a girl's best
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Let's make love
Oh yes, tiger!
(Everything's going so well!)

'Cause that's when those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend!Embed
