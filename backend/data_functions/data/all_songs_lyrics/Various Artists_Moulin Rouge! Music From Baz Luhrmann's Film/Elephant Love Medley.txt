Elephant Love Medley Lyrics
Love is a many splendored thing
Love lifts us up where we belong
All you need is love!

Please, don't start that again

All you need is love

A girl has got to eat

All you need is love

Or she'll end up on the streets

All you need is love

Love is just a game
I was made for loving you, baby, you were made for loving me

The only way of loving me, baby, is to pay a lovely fee

Just one night, give me just one night

There's no way, 'cause you can't pay

In the name of love, one night in the name of love

You crazy fool, I won't give in to you

Don't leave me this way
I can't survive without your sweet love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way

You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
I look around me, and I see, it isn't so, oh no

Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs

Well, what's wrong with that? I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again!
Love lifts us up where we belong
Where eagles fly, on a mountain high

Love makes us act like we are fools
Throw our lives away, for one happy day

We could be heroes! Just for one day

You, you will be mean

No I won't!

And I, I'll drink all the time
We should be lovers

We can't do that

We should be lovers, and that's a fact

Though nothing will keep us together

We could steal time...

Just for one day
We could be heroes, forever and ever
We could be heroes, forever and ever
We could be heroes...

Just because I will always love you
I

Can't help loving you
How wonderful life is

Now you're in the worldEmbed
