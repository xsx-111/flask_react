Your Song LyricsMy gift is my song
And this one's for you
And you can tell everybody
That this is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
Hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world
Sat on the roof
And I kicked off the moss
Well, some of these verses
Well, they...
They got me quite cross
But the sun's been kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that
Keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see, I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes
I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world
Hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world2Embed
