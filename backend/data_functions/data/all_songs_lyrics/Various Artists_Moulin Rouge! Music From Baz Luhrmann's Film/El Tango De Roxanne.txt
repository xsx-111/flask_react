El Tango De Roxanne Lyrics
First, there is desire
Then, passion
Then, suspicion
Jealousy, anger, betrayal!
Love is for the highest bidder, there is no trust
Without trust, there is no love!
Jealousy, yes, jealousy!
Will drive you!
Will drive you!
Will drive you!
Mad!
Roxanne
You don't have to put on that red light
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it is right
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Roxanne
You don't have to sell your body to the night

His eyes upon your face
His hand upon your hand
His lips caress your skin
It's more than I can stand!
Roxanne
Roxanne
Why does my heart cry?
Feelings I can't fight!
You're free to leave me
But just don't deceive me
And please believe me when I say
I love you!
(silence, someone says something in Spanish)
Y yo que te quiero tanto, ¿qué voy hacer?
Me dejaste, me dejaste por un montón de monedas
El alma se me fue
Se me fue el corazón
Ya no tengo ganas de vivir
Porque no te puedo convencer
Que no te vendas, Roxanne
Roxanne!
You don't have to put on that red light!
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Why does my
Heart cry?
Feelings I can't fight!Roxanne!
You don't have to put on that red light
Roxanne!
You don't have to wear that dress tonight!
Why does my heart cry?
Feelings I
Can't fightRoxanne!
Roxanne!
Roxanne!
Roxanne!
