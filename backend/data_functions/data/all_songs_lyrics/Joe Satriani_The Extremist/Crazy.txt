Crazy Lyrics
I feel like going out for a drive
Don't know if I'll make it back alive
My head's so heavy, my soul is black
Looking like something that the cat brought back

I'm going crazy
But it's alright

Outside, looking for something to do
Walking the streets, everybody looks like you
When you can't find love, you can feed your head
But you can't survive when your brain is dead

I'm going crazy
But it's alright
I'm going crazy
I think you better hold on tight

Give it to me
I'm going crazy
Yesterday, you and I were two
Now you're gone, I'm all black and blue
Don't know why, could be you're no good
If I could turn back the hands of time, you know I would

It's strange thinking these thoughts out loud
Better keep moving, blend in with the crowd
I can't believe I'm acting like a child
One thing I know you're driving me wild

I'm going crazy
But it's alright
I'm going crazy
I think it's going to be a long, long night

Give it to me
I'm going crazy
