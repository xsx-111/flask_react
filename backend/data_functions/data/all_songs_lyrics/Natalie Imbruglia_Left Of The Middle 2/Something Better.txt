Something Better LyricsI won't say anything
I'm hiding in the pink
If I move will I break the spell
Or am I boring you?
I can't feel anything
I'll think whatever you think
You took me riding on the big wheel
So I guess i'm happy now
And i'll stay with you
And i'll lay with you
And i'll always be there
Nothing will go wrong
Til something better comes along
So now you've swallowed me
Come and finish off the rest of me
We'll build a house with cactus lights
Spend perfect days and sleepless nights
Whatever
(whatever)
And i'll stay with you
And i'll lay with you
And i'll always be there
Nothing will go wrong
Til something better comes along
And i've lost my fingerprints
And i've lost my sixth sense
But you just don't feel a thing
When the needle's going in
And i'll stay with you
And i'll lay with you
And i'll always be there
Won't go nowhere
And i'll stay with you
(til something better comes along)
And i'll lay with you
(til something better comes along
And I will stay
And I will lay with you
(til something better comes along)
(til something better comes along)
(til something better comes along)
(til something better comes along)
So now you've swallowed me
Come and finish off the rest of meEmbed
