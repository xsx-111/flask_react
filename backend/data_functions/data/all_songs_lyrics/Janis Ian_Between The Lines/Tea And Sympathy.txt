Tea And Sympathy Lyrics
I don't want to ride the milk train anymore
I'll go to bed at nine and waken with the dawn
And lunch at half passed noon
Dinner prompt at five
The comfort of a few old friends long passed their prime

Pass the tea and sympathy
For the good ol' days long gone
We'll drink a toast to those who most
Believe in what they've won
It's a long, long time 'til morning
Lays wasted on the dawn
I'll not write another line
For my true love is gone

When the guests have done I'll tidy up the room
I'll turn the covers down in gazing at the moon
I'll pray to go quite mad
And live in long ago
Where you and I were once so very long ago

Pass the tea and sympathy
For the good ol' days long gone
Let's drink a toast to those who most
Believe in what they've won
It's a long, long time 'til morning
Lays wasted on the dawn
I'll not write another line
For my true love is gone
When I have no dreams to give you anymore
I'll light a blazing fire and wait within the door
And throw my life away
"I wonder why?", they all will say
Now I lay me down to sleep forever and a day

Pass the tea and sympathy
For the good ol' days are dead
Let's drink a toast to those who best
Survived the life they've led
It's a long, long time 'til morning
So build your fires high
Now I lay me down to sleep
Forever by your sideEmbed
