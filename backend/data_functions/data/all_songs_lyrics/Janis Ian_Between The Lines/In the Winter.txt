In the Winter Lyrics
The days are okay
I watch the TV in the afternoon
If I get lonely
The sound of other voices, other rooms are near to me
I'm not afraid
The operator
She tells the time, it's good for a laugh
There's always radio
And for a dime I can Talk to God, dial-a-prayer; Are you there?
Do you care? Are you there?

And in the winter
Extra blankets for the cold
Fix the heater getting old
I am wiser now, you know
And still as big a fool
Concerning you

I met your friend
She's very nice, what can I say?
It was an accident
I never dreamed we'd meet again this way, you're looking well
I'm not afraid
You have a lovely home
Just like a picture- no, I live alone
I found it easier
You must remember how I never liked the party life; Up all night Lovely wife, you have a lovely wife
And in the winter
Extra blankets for the cold
Fix the heater getting old
You are with her now, I know
I'll live alone forever
Not together, now

Oooh, oohEmbed
