Watercolors Lyrics
I remember photographs
Watercolors of the past
He turned and said, "You ask much of me"
Then when we made our peace
We'd lay between the sheets
He turned and said, "I set you free"

Go on, be a hero, be a photograph
Make your own myths, Christ, I hope they last
Longer than mine, wider than the sky
We measure time by

Go on, be a hero, I set you free
Your stagehand lovershave conquered me
They'll send you carnations
While smiling faces look on and applaud
Go on, go on, go away from me

I said, "Do you wish me dead?"
Lip service to books you've read
Articles on how to bed a bird in flight
You called it love, I called it greed
You say, "You take what you want"
I said, "You get what you need"

Go on, be a hero, be a man
Make your own destiny if you can
Go find a fence, locate a shell
And hide yourself, go on, go to hell
Go away from me, I need no charity

He said, "Come unto me
I am beauty, I am the light
Come unto me
Hold on the darkness and stay the night
I am wonder, I am the heart's delight
Tomorrow we'll fight"

Come on, come on
Come on, come near to me
Come be my fantasy
We'll talk it over again some time
You'll send some flowers to change my mind
But for tonight, turn out the light
Hold me
Come on, come on
Set me free
Lend me your charityEmbed
