Light a Light LyricsI hear your voice in every corridor
I see your face in every picture frame
I feel your eyes in every starry sky
Lover, am I coming home again
Now am I humble, who once was proud
Now am I silent, who once was loud
Now am I waiting for the sound of your saying
Lover, am I coming home again
When you’re gone, the sun don’t shine
Light a light, light a light for me
Bring me back home again
And how we loved, 'til the years were days
How we laughed all our tears away
And now the time begins to fade
Lover, am I coming home again
There’s a wisdom in the teachings
Of the old familiar songs
And a sorrow in repeating
All the old familiar wrongs
And a lesson to be learned
Though I’ve known all along
Lover, am i coming home again
Light a light, light a light for me
Light a light, light a light for me
Light a light, light a light for me
Bring me back home again
Bring me back home againEmbed
