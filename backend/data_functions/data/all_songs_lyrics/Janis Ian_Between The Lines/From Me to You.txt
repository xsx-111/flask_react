From Me to You LyricsI'm leaving by night
I'm leaving alone
I'm leaving it lie
When you waken I'll be gone
I would not beg for me
As I would not beg for you
Though I'd like to be the one
To see you through
Every step you have taken
Disappears with the tide
You're torn up and shaken
With changing your mind
You haven't got the grace
To say you'll finally decide
And you haven't got the strength
To stay and fight
Those people who surround you
Only want to see you weak enough to crawl
They'll lie for you decide for you
And buy up all your rights and all your wrongs
And they'll try to stop your singing
In the middle of your song
For they do not want you free
And they do not make you strong
But only drag you down
In the hole they're coming from
They say you are foolish in wanting the sun
Say you are selfish in learning to run
And they'll tell you that the darkness
Is a blessing in disguise
For you never have to notice
If you're sighted or you're blind
And they'll do their best
To keep you from the light
You're more than beginning
You're learning to fly
You feel like you're falling
But it passes in time
I hate to see a friend
Go down in flames without a song
So I'm waiting by the doorway
But I will not linger long
I'm leaving by night
I'm leaving alone
I'm leaving it lie
When you waken I'll be gone
I would not beg for me
As I could not beg for you
But I'd like to be the one
To see you throughEmbed
