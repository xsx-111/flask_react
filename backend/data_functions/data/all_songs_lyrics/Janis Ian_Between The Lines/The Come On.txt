The Come On LyricsI haven’t been loved by a man in quite a while
You know it ain’t easy making me smile
Friends have their lovers
Men on a string
There must be something terribly wrong with me
Sometimes I feel like I haven’t learned anything
How do you do?
Would you like to be friends?
No, I just want a bed for the night
Someone to tell me they care
You can fake it, that’s all right
In the morning I won’t be here
It’s a sacrificial altar
And I’m laying down my head
And I’m telling you up front --
I haven’t much to give
Is that how it’s done
Or shall I sing and dance?
Give me a chance
How do you do?
Do you want to be friends?
Yes, that might be very nice
Maybe we’ll fall in love
Every body has its price
Mine is yours for free
If you’ll be in love with me
I haven’t been loved by a man in quite a while
You know it ain’t easy making me smile
Friends have their lovers
Men on a string
There must be something terribly wrong with me1Embed
