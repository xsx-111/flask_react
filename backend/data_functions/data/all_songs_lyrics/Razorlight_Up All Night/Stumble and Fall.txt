Stumble and Fall LyricsI heard that it was a really big deal
And then I found out it was just nothing at all
You always say, "It's such a big deal."
But we both know that that's nothing at all
And I get over the breaks
And I stumble and fall
And I get over the breaks
And sometimes stumble and fall
You just won't admit that it's all in your hands
So I have to try so hard to make you understand
But all you can say is, "It's just part of the deal."
And I never asked you to understand
How I keep myself to myself in the crush of the crowd
But all you can say is "Who can? It's part of the deal."
Hey, and I, yes I get over the breaks
And I stumble and fall
And I get over the breaks
And sometimes I stumble and fall, yes I
Sing it up, sing it up, sing it up, sing
Well I, I get over the breaks
And I stumble and fall
And I get over the breaks
And I stumble and fall
Yes, I fall
Yes, I fall
I stumble and fallEmbed
