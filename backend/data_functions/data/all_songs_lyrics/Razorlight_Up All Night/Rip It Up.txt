Rip It Up LyricsWell hey girl
Get on the dancefloor
And rip it up, yeah
That's what it's there for
That's what it's there for
So rip it up, yeah
Ah rip it up and tear it up
Until you really don't know why
Until you don't know why
I've seen a man there
Down at the station
He's got a head of ideas
He's got too many reservations
It turns me round, yeah
It breaks my heart, yeah
It rips me up and tears me up
You know I really don't know why
You know I don't know why
She says love is the law
Why don't you come 'round no more?
She says I loved you so much more
When you were down on the floor
I said well well
That ain't nothing
You got to rip it up
You got to pick a stitch
And turn me 'round, yeah
And break my heart, yeah
And rip me up and tear me up
Until I really don't know why
I really don't know why
Hey girl
Get on the dancefloor
Just like I told you
That's what it's there for
That's what it's there for
So rip it up, yeah
Ah rip it up and tear it up
Until you really don't know why
Until you don't know why
So rip it up, yeah
And tear it up. yeah
And just please don't stop
And rip it upEmbed
