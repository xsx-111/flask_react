Leave Me Alone LyricsOh, when did you decide
To start living like it's suicide
And wasting all my time
And messing up my mind
Oh, now darling, please leave me alone
I'm so tired I wanna be on my own
But ya, you keep on callin' on my telephone
And I wish I could show you somewhere better
Better to go
And when you get there
Well, if you freak 'em all out
With your sweatshop charm
You'll leave them in no doubt
And when you get challenged
You'll only lie about your age
But it's the distance you travel
And the fields you unravel
Rattle the bars on your cage
But all I wish is just leave me alone
I'm so tired I wanna be on my own
But you, you keep on callin' on my telephone
And I wish I could show you somewhere better
Better, better, better to go
Somewhere else
Somewhere else
Somewhere else
Oh, you've got to
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Oh, just leave me alone
What don't you understand?
Just leave me alone
What don't you understand?
What part of that don't you understand?
Just, just leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Leave me a..
Leave me a..
Leave me a..
Leave me a..
Leave me a..
Leave me a..
Leave me aloneEmbed
