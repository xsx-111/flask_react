Golden Touch LyricsI know a girl with a golden touch
She's got enough, she's got too much
But I know you wouldn't mind
You could have it all if you wanted
You could have it all if it mattered so much
But then all they know is how to put you down
When you're there, they're your friend
But then when you're not around
They say, "Oh, she's changed"
You know what they mean
Well they're mean, they're just jealous
Because they never do the things
They wish that they could do so well
That kind of girl, yeah she's never alone
You leave a thousand messages on her phone
But you know you never get through
You could have it all if you wanted, yeah
You could have it all if it matters to you
But then all they know is how to put you down
When you're there, they're your friend
Oh, when you're not around
They say, "Oh, she's changed"
Oh, we know what that means
Well, it means they're just jealous
But they'll never do the things
That they wish that they could do so well
I saw my girl with the golden touch
Give them a taste but not too much
I just can't listen to the words of fools
But don't give away too much
Someone'll need your golden touch
Because all they know is how to put you down
When you're there, they're your friend
Oh, then when you're not around
They say, "Oh what, she's changed"
Yeah we know what that means
Well it means they're just jealous
They'll never do the things
That they wish that they could do so well
Because all they know is how to put you down
When you're there, they're your friend
Oh, when you're not around
They say, "Oh what, she's changed"
Oh, we know what that means
Well it means they're just jealous
They'll never do the things
That they wish that they could do so well
No, they'll never do the things
That they wish that they could do so well
I'm just telling you:
They never do the things
That they wish that they could do sooo well
Gettin' through
No, they never do the things
That they wish that they could do sooo well2Embed
