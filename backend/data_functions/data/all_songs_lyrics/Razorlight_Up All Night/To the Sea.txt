To the Sea LyricsAway and away, over bridges and sighs
And on and on, on and on
She keeps it all locked up right inside
But then up above, where the looking glass skies
Go on and on, on and on
She doesn't say a word, she keeps it inside
To the sea
To the sea
Oh down into the sea
Yeah, what about me
Yeah, what about me
She says, "I want to know ya."
Yeah, what about me?
Go away for a year and a day
Come back to me, oh you will see
Now throw it away, well there's money to be made
Oh darling you will make it in the sea
Yeah, to the sea
Yeah, to the sea
Oh down into the sea
Yeah, what about me
Yeah, what about me
She says, "I want to know what about me?"
Just pick me up, put me down
We all just get out of this old town
And leave it all, to the sea
So go away and then shut your mouth
'Cause darling, you'll see how it all turns out, ha
Throw it away for a year and a day
And then come back to me
Down to the sea
Down to the sea
Oh down into the sea
Yeah, what about me
Yeah, what about me
She says, "I really want to know what about me?"
Just pick me up, put me down
We all just get out of this old town
And leave it all to the sea
To the sea
No more, no more
Yeah, to the sea
Yeah, to the sea
No more, no more
In the sea
In the sea
In the sea
In the seaEmbed
