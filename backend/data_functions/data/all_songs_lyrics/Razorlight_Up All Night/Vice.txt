Vice LyricsWild is the wind
That strips away our sins
Yours is the night
But ya, you don't know where to begin
But I heard you say
You got a feeling that it's just around the bend
I heard you say
Sometimes you fall into the arms of no one at all
I mean to say that that's alright
I did what I could
Oh, sometimes I run
Yeah, sometimes I fall and if it's
L-O-V-E, I'll, I'll see you later
L-O-V-E, I'll, I'll see you later
Yours is the fire
That gets in my head
Mine is desire
So let it burn down your bed
Cause I heard about those stories, yeah
I guess everyone has
I heard them say sometimes you fall
Just on your own with no one at all
I mean to say that that's alright
I did what I could
Oh, sometimes I run
Yeah, sometimes I fall and if it's
L O V E, I'll see you later
L O V E, I'll, I'll see you later
You know, sometimes I run
Yeah, sometimes I fall and if it's
L O V E, I'll see you later
L O V E, I'll, I'll see you later
L O V E, L O V E
LOVE LOVE, yes I'll see you later
I'll see you some time
I'll see you there, I'll see you there
And you know, you know you can't touch love with a cynical feeling
No you, can't touch love unless you do believe in, oh lover, lover
There's no cynical feeling, I'll see you later, I'll see you some time, some time
You know its just like that
Sometimes you run
Sometimes you fall
Sometimes you crawl
Sometimes you hide
Ring my number back its 07761010233
Oh ring it off the wall, we'll ring it right back
We'll ring it right back, we'll ring it right back
That's just lifeEmbed
