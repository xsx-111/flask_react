In the City LyricsWell, it's a close one, a real close one
But no one gets hurt and she's got twice the fun
Now they kiss in the rain
And did someone call out someone's name
From a white cadillac on a wide wind
To her white dress across the great divide
Into the warm moonlight
And she's been reading Bukowski for days
Leans over, spits her name in my face
And says "Well, now you know how it feels"
Well, now you know how it feels
And I was lookin' for you
Lookin' for you
Lookin' for you in the city last night
And the boys in the band steal a kiss from the mystery of the night
11:59 to zero, little blonde hair in jeans, holds it tight
Turns on the heat and starts to fight, sayin' "That's my man."
Well, the myth of love must have been there
The spirit of possession was there
And the boys are at the bar
Yeah, they're mixing up their medicines
The girls are on their mobiles trying to get reception and
Johnny's shadow's getting long but he keeps on singing
His shadow's getting long but he keeps on singing
But I was lookin' for you
Lookin' for you
Lookin' for you in the city last night
And people so strange
People so strange
People just keep talkin' in the city at night
Now take off your shades and scroll down to number nine
You're living on the guest list, up against the meat rack
Head back, hand out, it's getting loud in here
Think you're gonna have to shout
And she's tearing off her clothes
He's mixing his drinks all up
Streets divide them, it's an empire of signs
That honey says she can read
It looks like trouble
It tastes like chocolate if you want it
It looks like trouble
But it tastes like chocolate if you want it
Still I was lookin' for you
Lookin' for you
Lookin' for you in the city last night
And people so strange
People so strange
People get so ugly in the city light
And I was lookin' for you
Yeah, I was lookin' for you
Yeah, I was lookin' for you in the city last night
And I was lookin' for you
Yeah, I was lookin' for you
Yeah, I was lookin' for you in the city last night
It was alright (alright)
Alright (alright)
Was alright (alright)
Was alright (alright)
Say my name (alright)
It's alright (alright)
It's alright
It's alright
Kiss and go
Kiss and goEmbed
