Up All Night LyricsI lost the sacred feeling but I
Made a couple of friends and now
Our things have never looked so good
Our things have never been so clear
And now I'm alone with you
I'm always up all night
And I get music ringing in my head
And I, I lose the strength to fight
'Cause I, I've been up all night
She's been up all night
We're, we're just up all night
This town is for the counterfeit dreamers
And maybe I'm one too, well I
I keep my hand behind my back when I
I don't know what else to do
The streets that I grew up in
They may mean nothing to you, but I
I'll show you where I come from if you please
Just tell me what I'm supposed to do
'Cause I, I've been up all night
She's been up all night
We're, we're just up all night
That sweet and sacred feeling, you know
Will never last long
Every time you turn around you'll see
One more part of you, yes it's gone
I need your spirit darling
And lend me your helping hand
And I, I'll meet you in the morning
When I've broken up the band
'Cause I've been up all night
She's been up all night
We're, we're just up all night
And I've been up all night
She's been up all night
We're, we're just up all night
I've been up all nightEmbed
