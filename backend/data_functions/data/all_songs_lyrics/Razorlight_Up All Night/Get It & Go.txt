Get It & Go LyricsWe talked all night about suicide
And she said if this is living
How come i never feel alive?
First time you're there
Well it gets you up
Second time alright
But its just not enough
No, it shootss through your veins
Tears all you nerves appart
Well, you give it a go
You give it a go
You know its alright
You know its alright
You give it a go
You give it a go
You get a little high
And you get a little low
I've seen you there so many times
You had your hands in your pocket
You said "I've just got this message on my phone, and its blowing my mind
You know its tearing me up inside out"
Strangles me, Strangles me
You know
First time you're there
Well it gets you up
Second times alright
But its the second circle of hell in your mind
It shoots through your veins
It tears all you nerves appart
Oh, just give it a go
Just give it a go
You know its alright
You know its alright
Just give it a go
Just give it a go
You get a little high
You get a little low
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
You know its alright
You know its alright
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
You get a little high
You get a little low
Well if its all so hard
Why dont you slide on down with me
And if your hanging on my words
Well thats alright with me
Because its just so easy
And we'll be alright
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
You know its alright
You know its alright
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
You get a little high
You get a little low
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
You get so high
Your so high
Count your fingers to four
One, Two, Three, Four
And thats itEmbed
