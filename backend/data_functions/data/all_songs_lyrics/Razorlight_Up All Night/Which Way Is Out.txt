Which Way Is Out LyricsThis party isn't working, oh no
Yeah, we need to find days like we used to
Living off a shoe string
Never, never knew what the night would bring
Now you look like you've been up for days
People walk in then they fall out
There's really not much
To shout about
Still you rack 'em up, knock 'em back
Line 'em up, put 'em down
Have a little taste, then you look about
Yeah, you rack 'em up, knock 'em back
Line 'em up, put 'em down
Have a little taste, then you figure out
And it all comes out
And you say I just can't get there, no more
So tell me which way's out
Ah, you say I just can't get there, no more
So tell me which way is out
And I put your picture right up on my wall
Said show me how to walk
Show me how to talk
Show me how to be a man
Well, That's all I need
And I really put all my faith in you
But then you left her right there
At the top of the stairs
With her mind half gone
And you never even cared, no
Still you rack 'em up, knock 'em back
Line 'em up, put 'em down
Have a little taste, then you look about
Yeah, you rack 'em up, knock 'em back
Line 'em up, put 'em down
Have a little taste, then you figure out
And it all comes out
And you say I just can't get there, no more
So tell me which way is out
You say I just can't get there, no more
So tell me which way is out
Tell me which way is out
Tell me which way is out
Tell me which way
I never know
I never know
I never know
I never knowEmbed
