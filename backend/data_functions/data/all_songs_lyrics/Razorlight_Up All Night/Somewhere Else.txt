Somewhere Else LyricsYou're an emotional wreck
You don't know who you are
You never say what you mean
And you keep your mouth shut
And your nights stay still
And then you come and call on me
You say I just can't help myself
I really really wish i could be Somewhere Else
Than here
And I met a girl
She asked me my name
I told her what it was
She looked at me
I tried to explain
Exactly what I'd lost
But now I just can't help myself
I really really wish I could be Somewhere Else
Than here
You give me everything I need
But I really really wish I could be Somewhere Else
Than here
Just anywhere else
Just anywhere else than here
And I won't forget it
No I won't forget it
No I won't forget it
And when I saw you there it was the first time
And you just walked on by
I was catching the sparks that flew from your heels
Trying to catch your eye
But that was
Somewhere Else
Yeah, Somewhere Else
Somewhere Else
I really really wish I could be
Somewhere Else
Somewhere Else
Somewhere Else
I really really wish I could be
Cause' I just can't help myself
I really really wish I could be somewhere else
Than here
And no, I just can't help myself
I really really wish I could
I got everything I need
I really really wish I could be
Somewhere Else
Somewhere Else
Somewhere Else
I really really wish I could beEmbed
