I Wants to Stay Here LyricsBESS
I wants to stay here
But I ain't worthy
You is too decent to understan'
For when I see him he hypnotize me
When he take hold of me with his hot hand
Someday I know he's coming back to call me
He's goin' to handle me an' hold me so
It's goin' to be like dyin', Porgy, deep inside me -
But when he calls, I know I have to go
PORGY
If dere warn't no Crown, Bess, if dere was only jus' you an'
Porgy, what den?
BESS
I loves you, Porgy
Don' let him take me
Don' let him handle me an' drive me mad
If you kin keep me
I wants to stay here wid you forever
An' I'd be glad
PORGY
There, there, Bess, you don' need to be afraid no mo'
You's picked up happiness and laid yo' worries down
You goin' to live easy, you goin' to live high
You goin' to outshine every woman in dis town
An' remember, when Crown come that's my business, Bess!
BESS
I loves you, Porgy
Don' let him take me
Don' let him handle me
With his hot han'
If you kin keep me
I wants to stay here wid you forever
I got my man
PORGY
What you think I is, anyway
To let dat dirty houn' dog steal my woman?
If you wants to stay wid Porgy, you goin' stay
You got a home now, Honey, an' you got love
So no mo' cryin', can't you understan'?
You goin' to go about yo' business, singin' 'cause
You got Porgy, you got a manEmbed
