A Woman Is A Sometime Thing LyricsLissen to yo' daddy warn you
'Fore you start a-travelling
Woman may born you, love you and mourn you
But a woman is a sometime thing
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing
Oh, a woman is a sometime thing
Yo' mammy is the first to name you
Then she'll tie you to her apron string
Then she'll shame you and she'll blame you
Till yo' woman comes to claim you
'Cause a woman is a sometime thing
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing
Oh, a woman is a sometime thing
Don't you never let a woman grieve you
Just 'cause she got yo' weddin' ring
She'll love you and deceive you
Take yo' clothes and leave you
'Cause a woman is a sometime thing
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing

Lissen to yo' daddy warn you
'Fore you start a-travelling
Woman may born you, love you and mourn you
But a woman is a sometime thing
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing
Oh, a woman is a sometime thing
Yo' mammy is the first to name you
Then she'll tie you to her apron string
Then she'll shame you and she'll blame you
Till yo' woman comes to claim you
'Cause a woman is a sometime thing
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing
Don't you never let a woman grieve you
Just 'cause she got yo' weddin' ring
She'll love you and deceive you
Take yo' clothes and leave you
'Cause a woman is a sometime thing
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing
There now, what I tells you; he's asleep alreadyEmbed
