Bess, You Is My Woman Now LyricsBess, you is my woman now
You is, you is
And you must laugh and sing and dance
For two instead of one
Want no wrinkle on yo' brow
Nohow
Because the sorrow of the past is all done, done
Oh, Bess, my Bess
Porgy, I's yo' woman now
I is, I is
And I ain't never goin' nowhere 'less you shares the fun
There's no wrinkle on my brow
Nohow
But I ain't goin', you hear me sayin'
If you ain't goin' with you, I'm stayin'
Porgy, I's yo' woman now
I's yours forever
Mornin' time and evenin' time and
Summer time and winter time
Mornin' time and evenin' time and
Summer time and winter timе
Bess, you got yo' man
Bess, you is my woman now and forevеr
Ths life is jes' begun
Bess, we two is one
Now and forever
Oh, Bess, don't mind those women
You got yo' Porgy
I knows you means it
I seen it in yo' eyes, Bess
We'll go swingin'
Through the years a-singin'
Porgy, I's yo' woman now
I is, I is
And I ain't never goin' nowhere 'less you shares the fun
There's no wrinkle on my brow
Nohow
But I ain't goin', you hear me sayin'
If you ain't goin' with you, I'm stayin'
Porgy, I's yo' woman now
I's yours forever
Mornin' time and evenin' time and
Summer time and winter time
Mornin' time and evenin' time and
Summer time and winter time
Oh, my Porgy, my man, Porgy
My Bess, my Bess
From this minute I'm tellin' you
I keep this vow: Porgy, I's yo' woman nowEmbed
