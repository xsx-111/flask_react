Oh, Doctor Jesus LyricsOh, doctor jesus, who done trouble de water in de sea of gallerie
An' likewise who done cas' de devil out of de afflicted time
An' time again
Oh, doctor jesus, what make you ain' lay yo' han' on dis po'
Sister head?
An' chase de devil out of her down a steep place into de sea
Like you used to do time an' time again
Lif' dis po' cripple up out of de dus'!
An' lif' up his woman an' make her well time an' time again
An' save us all for jesus sake, amenEmbed
