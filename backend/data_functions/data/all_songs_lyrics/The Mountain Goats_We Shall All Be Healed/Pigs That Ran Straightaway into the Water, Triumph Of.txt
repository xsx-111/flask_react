Pigs That Ran Straightaway into the Water, Triumph Of Lyrics
The story of the pigs who ran straightaway into the water, and their great triumph, woo!

You're gonna send me back to where I came from
Please don't send me back to where I came from
Let me go
Where the white magnolias grow
You're gonna fit me for that orange jumpsuit
Please don't fit me for that orange jumpsuit
Let me ride
Where the dragonflies glide

Yeah, but you're going to do
What you want to do
No matter what
I ask of you
You think you hold the high hand
I've got my doubts
I come from Chino where the asphalt sprouts

Big bus headed southeast from the courthouse
But I'm not headed southeast from the courthouse
Let some mysterious chunk of space debris
Puncture the roof and set me free
And even if I have to go to Claremont
Well I guess I'll just have to go to Claremont
Let me go
Let me lie low

Yeah, but you're going to do
What you want to do
No matter what
I ask of you
And you send your dark messengers
To tempt me
I come from Chino so all your threats are emptyEmbed
