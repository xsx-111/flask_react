Linda Blair Was Born Innocent LyricsGentle hum of the old machines
Here we come scrubbed and scoured
Patches on our jeans
When the drone sounds
In the cool night wind
We pick up the call
Kick all the traces in
Hungry for love
Ready to drown
So tie down the sails
We're going downtown
Great big drain on the power grid
You may not like Tate's methods
But you've got to admit
She's a real nice kid
We walk light
Down the wires
Higher than weather balloons
Empty hearts on fire
Hungry for love
Ready to drown
So tie down the sails tonight
We're going downtown1Embed
