Letter from Belgium Lyrics
Martin calls to say he's sending old electrical equipment
That's good we can always use some more electrical equipment
In the cold clear light of day down here
Everyone's a monster
That's cool with all of us
We've been past the point of help since early April
Susan and her notebook
Freehand drawings of Lon Chaney
Blueprints for geodesic domes
Recipes for cake

Yeah we're all here
Chewing our tongues off
Waiting for the fever to break

When we walk out in the sunlight
We tell everyone we know it hurts our eyes
When the real reason we don't like it
Is that it makes us wonder if we're dying
And Martin's found an old trunk
Full of stage makeup in the basement
And he's sending it along
We can always use more makeup
Yeah more creams and powders
And Carrie's got the feeling
That the people next door
Will close in like a wolf pack
Should we make one small mistake

Yeah we're all here
Chewing our tongues off
Waiting for the fever to breakEmbed
