Quito LyricsWhen I receive the blessing I've got coming
I'm going to raise a nice cold glass of water
And toast the living and the dead
Who've gone before me and my head
Will throb like an old wound reopening
When I get off the bus down there my children
They all are going to greet me at the station
Like gypsies they will dance around me and
The choral droning sounds their voices make will
Saturate the evening
When I get off the wheel I'm going to stop
And make amends to everyone I've wounded
And when I wave my magic wand
Those few who've slipped the surly bonds
Will rise like salmon at the spawningEmbed
