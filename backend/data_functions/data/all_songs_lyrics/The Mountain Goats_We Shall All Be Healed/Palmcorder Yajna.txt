Palmcorder Yajna Lyrics
Holt Boulevard
Between Garey and White
Hooked up with some friends at the Travelodge
Set ourselves up for the night
Carpenter ants in the dresser
Flies in the screen
It will be too late by the time we learn
What these cryptic symbols mean

And I dreamt of a house
Haunted by all you tweakers with your hands out
And the headstones climbed up the hills

Send somebody out for soda
Comb through the carpet for clues
Reflective tape on our sweatpants
Big holes in our shoes
Every couple minutes
Someone says he can't stand it anymore
Laugh lines on our faces
Scale maps of the ocean floor

And I dreamt of a camera
Pointed out from inside the television
And the aperture yawning and blinking
And the headstones climbed up the hills
If anybody comes to see me
Tell them they just missed me by a minute
If anybody comes into our room while we're asleep
I hope they incinerate everybody in it

And I dreamt of a factory
Where they manufacture what I needed
Using shiny new machines
And the headstones climbed up the hillsEmbed
