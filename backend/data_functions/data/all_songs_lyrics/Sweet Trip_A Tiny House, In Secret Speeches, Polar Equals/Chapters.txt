Chapters LyricsIf you hear these words, immerse your heart
All this skin is pouring true
Love for life, electrified
Heart is all for you
If you hear this mouth, caress your heart
Know the deepest hunger for you
Kiss your spine, electrified
Body is all for you
Precious is the world for you and I
Nothing else matters but you
Bless your heart, intensify
Soul is all for you
And if you tell the world, you'll take a chance
Know that I will walk it with you
Hand in hand, electrified
And I will love you2Embed
