At Last a Truth That Is Real LyricsComes the day from sweetest nights
You're the one in my heart
Love
Days will end, and nighttime falls
You're the one in my mind, in my heart
Love
May days come to kiss your hand
Fall asleep in my arms
Love
Night will come into the dawn
You'll be safe in my heart, to the end
LoveEmbed
