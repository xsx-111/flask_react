In Sound, We Found Each Other Lyrics
I'm supposed to record?
Oh!

How foolish the sound we conquer
How foolish they sound together
And unlike your dreams
We always find each other
Unconscious the man yet sober
The tune that he sings to her lover
And just like a dream
We'll thrive to find each other
Pretentious the sound we molded
A tube made of clay and butter
Unconscious to me
Just like we found each other

And we're cool
Just because of you
Just because of you
Just because of you
Just because of you
And we're cool
Just because of you
Just because of you
Just because of you
Just because of you3Embed
