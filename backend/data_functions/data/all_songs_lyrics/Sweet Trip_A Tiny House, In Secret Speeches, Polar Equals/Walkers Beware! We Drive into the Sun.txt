Walkers Beware! We Drive into the Sun Lyrics
Vehicle passing through the street
There it is
I can hear it
You're marinating something, you know?
Looks like fish
Defrosting
Oh, ok, hahaha

Serenade the night
We whisper
Songs made out of blood
We have all the time
Dress, undress
This pattern
Aching to repeat
Drive into the sun
Beware

Dress, undress, la la la
Hold, be held, la la la
Crash your lips with mine
Into the sun
Serenade the night
We whisper
Songs madе out of blood
We have all the timе
Beware
To allEmbed
