Come Spend the Night Lyrics
Come spend the night, come spend the night
Come and shed the layers that protect you
We may go far or be still and warm
Long as I fall into a dream with you

This is our shelter when senses run mad
Please stay another night
Please stay

Come spend the night, come spend the night
Come and shed the layers that protect you
Bare is your spine, hands take their time
Aching for the sweetness of your heart on mine

This is our shelter when senses run mad
Please stay another night
Please stayEmbed
