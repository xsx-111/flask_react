Snow Purple Treasures LyricsHold!
Turn your back
Face! Look through
Merge our eyes
Here we are
Empty room
Nothing but a dream
Endless it will be with you
Love
Purple is the heart
An overwhelming night
Full of stars that call out your name
Hold! turn back
Face! Look through
Come to me
Darling za...
Time...
There's no time
Left this world too soon
Making room for you and I
Love
Purple is the heart
An overwhelming night
Full of stars that call out your name
Love I'll treasure your heart
Cradled in these hands
Fall and watch the stars call out your nam–µEmbed
