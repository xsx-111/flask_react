Eave Foolery Mill Five LyricsThere's a high
An impression of you
There's no why
Rising joy all for you
Take your time
Gentle bite
Girl you're light
Dazzling splendor, a jewel
Passion cast
Crush the heart
Love to last
Keen a smile
We are wild
Stay forever
There's a high
An impression of you
There's no why
Rising joy all for you
Take your time
Gentle bite
Girl you're light
Dazzling splendor, a jewel
Passion cast
Crush the heart
Love to last
Keen a smile
We are wild
Stay for–µver1Embed
