Surviving a Smile LyricsLook at your smile
Misty love and wonder
Rune I'm falling under
It is alive
Bright a heart plunders
And then revives
Survive... glorious the gaze
Survive... weak from the daze
Survive... only you can gleam a lovely smile
Look at your smile
Rune I'm falling under
Misty love and wonder
It is alive
Stay for a while
Smile like summer moonlight
Brighten up the skyline
Of my life
Survive... glorious the gaze
Survive... weak from the daze
Survive... only you can gleam a lovely smile
Survive... glorious the gaze
Survive... weak from the daze
Survive... only you can gleam a lovely smile
Survive
Survive
Only you can gleam a lovely smile
