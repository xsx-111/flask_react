Tiny Houses LyricsRemedy, never see
Close your eyes, pause
Rest your mind, my sleepyhead
I'll warm you
Hold you tight, hold for life
Never let you go unloved
Tiny houses to escape
I'll follow you
Walk with me, blow the wind
Soar the leaves through the ground
Fall is flowing through your hair
I smile at you
What you see, never seen
Lips connected to the heart
Rest your eyes, my sleepyhead
I'll warm you
Sleepyhead, I dare say
You take my breath away
You take my breath away, ahh
Sleepyhead, I darе say
You take my breath away
You take my brеath away2Embed
