Dracula Mountain Lyrics
See you in the evening
See you in the dawn
See you in the daylight
And in the beyond
See you in the evening
See you in the dawn
See you in the daylight
And in the beyond
And in the beyond
And in the beyond
Ah!

Duh, duh, duh-duh, ah-ah
Duh, duh, duh-duh, ah-ah
Duh, duh, duh-duh, ah-ah
Duh, duh, duh-duh, ah-ah
Alright!
Duh, duh, duh-duh, ah-ah
Duh, duh, duh-duh, ah-ah
Duh, duh, duh-duh, ah-ah
Duh, duh, duh-duh, ah-ah

Every werewolf has his day
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

See you in the evening
See you in the dawn
See you in the daylight
And in the beyond
See you in the evening
See you in the dawn
See you in the daylight
And in the beyond
Argh!

And in the beyond
And in the beyond
And in the beyond
And in the beyond
And in the beyond
And in the beyond
And in the beyond
And in the beyond
