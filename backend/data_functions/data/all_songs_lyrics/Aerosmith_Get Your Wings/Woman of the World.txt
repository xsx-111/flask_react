Woman of the World Lyrics
Well she's a woman of the world, and God she knows it
She'll turn my head every time she shows it
Yeah, nothing you can do, nothing you can say
No way you can try to change her way
She might be gone tomorrow, honey, say what you gotta say
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, what a woman
How are you feeling?

Know I tried, I tried so hard to please her
She'd give me a look if I beg to tease her
There's nothing you can say, nothing you can do
No way you can try to coochie coo
She might be gone tomorrow, oh Lordy what you going to do?


And I tried with an open hand and a heart of sorrow
Hoped that everything would be alright
Don't save too much loving for tomorrow
Get out all your loving here tonight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

And I tried with an open hand and a heart of sorrow
Hoped that everything would be alright, alright, alright
Don't save too much loving for tomorrow
Get out all your loving here tonight


She got big-eyed cats, she got coats of sable
She seats 44 at her dinner table
And there's nothing you can do, nothing you can say
No way you can try to change her way
She might be gone tomorrow, oh throwing it all away
