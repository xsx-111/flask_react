Spaced Lyrics
Spaced in time, child of nine
Doing 20 years on the way
Fire and steel, Earth unreal
Find another planet to stay
Papa died, ma survived
Telling me about her ordeal
And the soul she could not feel
'Cause they made her so unreal

Lightning years, disappears
20 million years on my brain
Synthesize, overrides
Trying to keep from going insane
And my soul, I cannot feel
'Cause they made me so unreal

Spaced enough to know I feel there's nothin' out there
Spaced enough to know I feel I really don't care
Spaced enough to feel I'm really losing my mind

And I'm never never never never ever going back
I'm off the track
No one even knows I'm alive
Spaced, without a trace
Waiting for the word to arrive
I'm the last man to survive1Embed
