Lord of the Thighs Lyrics
Down to who knows who, just to socialize
I'm waiting for my girls, when you call my eyes (Ooh)
You got no way to make a man, honey
You got to understand
I'm your man, child, lord of the thighs

Well, well, Lordie my God
What do we got here? (Haha)
She's flashing across the floor
Make it perfectly clear
You're the bait, and you're the hook
Someone 'bound to take a look
I'm your man, child, lord of the thighs


You must have come here to find it
You've got the look in your eyes
Although you really don't mind it
I am the lord of the thighs

You must have come here to find it
You've got the look in your eyes
Although you really don't mind it
I am the lord of your thighs2Embed
