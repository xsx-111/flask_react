Waiting (Phase One) LyricsWaiting
To be born again
Wanting
The saddest kind of pain
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away
Nothing
Is what I feel
Waiting
For the drugs to make it real
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away
Waiting
To be disciplined
Aching
For your nails across my skin
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away1Embed
