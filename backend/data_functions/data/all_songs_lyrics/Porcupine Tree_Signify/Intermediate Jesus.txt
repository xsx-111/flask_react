Intermediate Jesus Lyrics
Friend, in these days you need more than advice.  With this satanic invasion from legion diabolic, you need Christ
Sin can bar you from God.  Disobedience, pride, rebellion can separate your God.  Satan with his devils will take possession

How are we going to answer these young people today?
The young people that are crying out
… live fast
… look beautiful
… die young
… the bomb
… they drop the ball

… ambient
… your body with expand
… I am certain
… may you attempt
… the intermediate Jesus
… can bar you from God
… will separate you
… his devils will take
… his devils will take possession
… God bless you1Embed
