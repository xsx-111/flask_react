The Sleep of No Dreaming LyricsAt the age of sixteen I grew out of hope
I regarded the cosmos through a circle of rope
So I threw out my plans, ran on to the wheel
And emptied my head of all childish ideals
The sleep of no feeling
The sleep of no being
The sleep of no dreaming
The sleep of no dreaming
I married the first girl who wasn't a man
And smiled as the spiders ran all over my hands
The sleep of no feeling
The sleep of no being
The sleep of no dreaming
The sleep of no dreaming
Made a good living by dying, it's true
As the world in my TV leaks onto my shoes
The sleep of no feeling
The sleep of no being
The sleep of no dreaming
The sleep of no dreaming
The sleep of no feeling
The sleep of no being
The sleep of no dreaming
The sleep of no dreaming2Embed
