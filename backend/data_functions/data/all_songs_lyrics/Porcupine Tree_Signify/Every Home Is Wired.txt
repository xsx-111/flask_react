Every Home Is Wired LyricsModem load and failsafe
Electric teenage dust
Hit the solvent keypad
Start the neural rust
Power on the highway
Data in my head
Surfing on the network
Part of me is dead
Every home is wired
Swimming in the circuit
Somebody has expired
This will be the future
Every home is wired
Every home is wired2Embed
