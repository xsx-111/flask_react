Songs of Old Lyrics
Turn the key in the iron lock
Of the old oak door
Lean into its passages
With all my weight and enter
Immediately my olfactory senses its home
Paper thin and paraffin
And the glimmering of gold

Marble hands out pouring water
Silver wings delivering wishes
Streams of colored light
Make Hell a home

Mama singin' the songs of old
Mama singin' the songs of old
Singin' the rock of ages
Though the gold is marred by red
Singin' the rock of ages
Melt 'em down and make new saints
Singin' the rock of ages
Empires are made this way
Singin' the rock of ages
Endless hopes and endless fears
Polish this stone
The deeper desire
The finer the grain
This time I walk the stairway
And turn the key in the cellar door
I want to know why

All these stories
Never spoken
Danced or drawn or sung or written
Of how we built this temple
Soul by soul

Mama singin' the songs of old
Mama singin' the songs of old
Singin' the rock of ages
Though the gold is marred by red
Singin' the rock of ages
Melt 'em down and make new saints
Singin' the rock of ages
Empires are made this way
Singin' the rock of ages
Mama singin' the songs of old
Singin' the rock of ages
Though the gold is marred by red
Singin' the rock of ages
Melt 'em down and make new saints
Singin' the rock of ages
Empires are made this way
Singin' the rock of agesEmbed
