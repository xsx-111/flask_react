Simon Says Lyrics
Pounds falling out my pocket
We went straight out and bought it
Cats, stripes, stars, and swishes
Standing in a line
The satellite connects
We're hypnotized by TV sets
And sing along commercial anthems
Like a zombie choir
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

We're all talkin' 'bout it
'Round the clock about it
Scheme about it, dream about it
Eat it all the time
It's on the grocery list
Below the cream, above the chips
What Simon says, we've got to listen
Tell us what we like

'Cause I like what I like
Awwwww
I like what I like
Awwwww
But why do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I?
WWW, don't forget life before the internet
The streets were run by sharks and jets
And children running wild
As we pixelate a generation
Children become application
Pawn consumer pollinators
Buy it, buy and buy
'Cause I like what I like

We're all talkin' 'bout it
'Round the clock about it
Scheme about it, dream about it
Even when we die
It's on the grocery list
Below the cream, above the chips
What Simon says, we've got to listen
Tell us what we like
We're still talkin' 'bout it
Can't stop talking
'Cause the needle in the haystack
Is a splinter in your mind
It can get quite confused
When you don't pick the words you chose
Involuntarily advertising for their enterprise
'Cause I like what I like
Awwwww
I like what I like
Awwwww
I like what I like
Awwwww
But why do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I
Do I

Know every climbing tree?
Do I know every climbing tree?
Do I know every climbing tree?
Do I know every climbing tree?
Do I know every climbing tree?
Do I?1Embed
