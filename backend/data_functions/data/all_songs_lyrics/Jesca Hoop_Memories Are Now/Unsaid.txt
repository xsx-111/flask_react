Unsaid Lyrics
I have never felt for any other lover
Like I feel for you
Our love is on a higher plane
A high humbling and holy thing
And your love is king
And champion of my heart
A heavy weight
I'm gonna make you stay
Don't wanna fight
Don't wanna fight
Wanna hold you close
Wanna love you right
Wanna love you right
'Cause the night is long and the bed is cold
And the heart is hard and ember is coal
And the door is cold when you walk away

Don't walk away like that
Don't turn your back on me
I know that I don't make it easy on you, babe
So, come on back

Let's not get mad
Show teeth
Say things we wish could be
Let's not stay mad
Get mean
Say things we wish could be unsaid
I have never felt for any other lover
Like I feel for you
Our love is on a higher plane
A high humbling and holy thing
And your love is king
And champion of my heart
A heavy weight
I'm gonna make you stay
Don't wanna fight
Don't wanna fight
Wanna hold you close
Wanna love you right
Wanna love you right
'Cause the night is long and the bed is cold
And the heart is hard and ember is coal
And the door is cold when you walk away

Don't walk away like that
Don't turn your back on me
I know that I don't make it easy on you, babe
So, come on back

Let's not get mad
Show teeth
Say things we wish could be
Let's not stay mad
Get mean
Say things we wish could be
Let's not get mad
Show teeth
Say things we wish could be
Let's not stay mad
Get mean
Say things we wish could be unsaidEmbed
