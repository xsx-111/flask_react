Memories Are Now Lyrics
Memories are now
Memories are now

I was not there
I won't be there
I'm only here
Memories are now
I can carry this weight
I can stand up tall
Look you in the eye

You haven't broken me yet
You don't scare me to death
You don't scare me at all
Though you try
I've lived enough life
I've earned my stripes
With my knife in the ground
This is mine

Clear the way, I'm coming through
No matter what you say
I've got work to be doing
If you're not here to help
Go find some other life to ruin
Let me show you the door
And the only fear
Is a thing called fear
I am only here
I have only now
To bear the load
To feel my way
Trust my mistakes

I've seen you before
I know your face
I fell for that line, shame on you
You've got this idea
I can be fooled again with the line
Shame on me

Clear the way, I'm coming through
No matter what you say
I've got work to be doing
If you're not here to help
Go find some other life to ruin
You have outstayed your welcome
Best get up, get on, get movin'
Get movin', get movin', get movin'
Let me show you the door
Memories are now
Memories are now
Memories are now
And every doubt is just
A trigger proving strength

Clear the way, I'm coming through
No matter what you say
I've got work to be doing
If you're not here to help
Go find some other life to ruin
Take a bite out of me
Find you've got more than you're happy chewin'
You have outstayed your welcome
Best get up, get on, get movin'
Get movin', get movin', get movin', get movin'
Let me show you the door
