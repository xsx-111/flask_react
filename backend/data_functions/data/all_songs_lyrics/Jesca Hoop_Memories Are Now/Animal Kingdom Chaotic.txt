Animal Kingdom Chaotic Lyrics
Where would we find a pulse?
I just work here, computer says no
Are we all ones and zeros?
I just work here, computer says no

Ooh, you know you wanna but the
Ooh, computer says no
Ooh, you know you wanna, wanna
Take back control
Ooh

I say it is possible
But your computer says no
You say it's impossible
But your dumb computer says no

Ooh, you know you wanna but the
Ooh, computer says no
Ooh, you know you wanna, wanna
Take back control
Take back control
Take back control
Take back control
Humankind wiped out by rise in drone
Take back control
Fightin', killin' by remote control

You know you wanna but the drone
You know you wanna but the drone
You know you wanna but the drone
You know you wanna but the
You know you wanna but computer says no
You know you wanna but the
Take back control

Robots are the new exotic
Animal kingdom, chaotic
Smoking jacket, hand in pocket
Oh, how I learned to love the rocket

Ooh, you know you wanna but the
Ooh, computer says no
Ooh, you know you wanna, wanna
Take back control
Ooh, you know you wanna but the
Ooh, computer says no
Ooh, you know you wanna, wanna
Take back control
Take back control
Take back control
Take back control
Humankind wiped out by rise in drone
Take back control
Fightin', killin' by remote control
Take back control
Humankind wiped out by rise in drone
Take back control
Fightin', killin'
Fightin', killin'
Fightin', killin'
Fightin', killin' by remote control

You know you wanna but the drone
You know you wanna but the drone
You know you wanna but the droneEmbed
