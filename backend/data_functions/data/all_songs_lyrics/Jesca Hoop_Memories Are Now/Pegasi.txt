Pegasi Lyrics
You found a map to my heart
It led you to the well
You combed out my mane
I'll wear your saddle and reins
With all these stars at my feet
I'll stamp and tap the spring
With my rider a mount
I feel like spreading my wings
Take to the sky like poetry

When we're in love, we're alive
You're the envy of the sky
Every ember wants to ride the supernova
But I fear you'll see the day
When I've endured all I can take
I won't bend but I will break
Under the weight

Because you broke within me
What others could not tame
I'll summon the wind
And do your bidding day by day
With your firm, strong hand
Go steady toward the north
We are a thing of beauty
Lit by the fires of iron ore
Your good ol' girl was built to soar
When we're in love, we're alive
You're the envy of the sky
Every ember wants to ride the supernova
But I fear you'll see the day
That I've endured all I can take
I won't bend but I will break
Under the weight

Dying star
Dying star
Dying star

Through many love-lit moons
I served my rider well
I suffered the bit
And took his spur into my side
And still, I paid that price
When I shook that bridle free
And my beloved rider fell
From the stars into the sea
You're of the Earth, I'm Pegasi

When we're in love, we're alive
You're the envy of the sky
Every ember wants to ride the supernova
But I fear you'll see the day
That I've endured all I can take
I won't bend but I will break
Under the weight
Dying star
Dying star
Dying starEmbed
