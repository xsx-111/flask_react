The Coming Lyrics
Jesus turned in his crown of thorns today
And announced to the Earth and the heavens
The end of his reign
He took a seat next to the Devil and said
"I need a new name"
And the coming never came

My whole life
I fervently served him and obeyed
And I walked through this world full of sinners
And I kept them at bay
'Cause there's only enough room at his table
For the souls that are saved
And they're coming to shut the gate
You're too little and too late
And you can't get in on that name
But I don't buy it
I refuse to think that my best friend is going to Hell anymore
And condescend to offer her a key to her salvation
Like it's something I have and can afford
And I won't blame my parents for clinging to the good word
In hopes that it makes sense of it all
And believing in a story like it was the Bible
When it was just a tale made tall
Hey ya
Hey ya
Hey ya

Now I wake up to the most spirit-rattling scare
As I'm losing my religion, layer by layer
'Cause it's triggering all of the trip lines
Of the traps and the snares
It's that old device called fear
That old device called fear

Now it's the long ride through the unknown which I embrace
And the cops and the robbers
And the cowboys and the Indians have got the same face
We just each of us doing our best to get by day by day
And Heaven is yours to take
And our choices day by day
Bring us closer or further away

I understood the risk that asking any kind of question
Could unravel me with one small fray
But I looked in my closet filled with ignorance, intolerance
And a fear that was turning to hate
But that is not the meaning or intention of the teaching
Or the truth from which the message came
And I can't turn a blind eye to centuries of conflict
And wrongdoing in his name
In his name
In his name
Hey ya
Hey ya

Jesus turned in his crown of thorns today
And announced to the Earth and the heavens
The end of his reign
He took a seat next to the Devil and said
"I need a new name"
And the coming never cameEmbed
