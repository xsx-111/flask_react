The Lost Sky Lyrics
I walk the dark star, the lost sky
Searching for your signal, receive mine
I caught your cold and our tears became laughter
Happy ever after
Out of our secrets, we built a home
Confide and fortify, blood, bone
A love like ours comes 'round once in a lifetime
Sending you a lifeline

The bitter burn of a signal run cold
You became the dark star and left me all alone
A love like ours comes 'round once in a lifetime
Sending you a lifeline
The bitter burn of a signal run cold
You became the dark star and left me all alone
A love like ours comes 'round once in a lifetime
Sending you a lifeline

When we said the words "I love you"
I said them 'cause they are true
Why would you say those words to me
If you could not follow through?
Go wash your mouth out, child
I walk the dark star, the lost sky
Searching for your signal, receive mine
I caught your cold and our tears became laughter
Happy ever after
Out of our secrets, we built a home
Confide and fortify, blood, bone
A love like ours comes 'round once in a lifetime
Sending you a lifeline

The bitter burn of a signal run cold
You became the dark star and left me all alone
A love like ours comes 'round once in a lifetime
Sending you a lifeline

And when we said the words "I love you"
I said them 'cause they are true
Why would you say those words to me
If you could not follow through?
Go wash your mouth out, child

I walk the dark star, the lost sky
Searching for your signal, receive mine
I caught your cold and our tears became laughter
Happy ever after
Out of our secrets, we built a home
Confide and fortify, blood, bone
A love like ours comes 'round once in a lifetime
Sending you a lifeline
The bitter burn of a signal run cold
You became the dark star and left me all alone
A love like ours comes 'round once in a lifetime
Sending you a lifeline
The bitter burn of a signal run cold
You became the dark star and left me all alone
A love like ours comes 'round once in a lifetime
Sending you a lifeline

And when we saidEmbed
