Cut Connection Lyrics
I'm living the dream
In the dream I'm buried alive
Two bed grave
One bath, car in the drive
Mirrored covered windows block the light
Feeding back reflection distorts life
Cut connection

Cut connection
Cut connection
Cut connection
Come on, be the drummer in my
Come on, be the drummer in my heart

I summon your hands
To bring me what is mine
I flatter your eyes and
Fail the heart behind
All else element in my design
I don't waste my breath
Don't waste my time
Cut connection
Cut connection
Cut connection
Cut connection
Cut connection
Come on, be the drummer in my
Come on, be the drummer in my
Come on, be the drummer in my heart

I want for your kiss, for your kiss
My lips won't part
I want for your touch, for your touch
My hands won't move
Come on, bring that friction, get that spark
Come on, be the drummer in my heart
Cut connection

Cut connection
Cut connection
Cut connection
Cut connection
Come on, be the drummer in my
Come on, be the drummer in my
Come on, be the drummer in my heart
Come on up to the old rock
To the old rock
To the well
Drink from the old well
Be a beggar
Be a king
Be a cold machine
Be a part of all things
Come on up to the old rock
To the old rock
To the well
Drink from the old well
Be a beggar
Be a king
Be a cold machine
Be a part of all things
Come on up to the old rock
To the old rock
To the well
Drink from the old well
The horizon
Ocean floor
Sail on wounded wing
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all things
Be a part of all thingsEmbed
