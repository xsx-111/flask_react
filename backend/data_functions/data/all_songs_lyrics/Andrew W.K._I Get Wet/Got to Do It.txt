Got to Do It Lyrics
You gotta keep up
You gotta keep going
No you never let down
You gotta keep going
You gotta keep up
You gotta keep going
I went around the place where we once went before
But I never knew it hurt so bad
I wandered back again, but you just slammed the door
I never knew it hurt so bad

We were nothing but kids on top
Never gonna stop
We never let down
We gotta keep up
Keep our heads on high
Never gonna die
'Cause we gotta keep it alive

When you're down on your luck
You gotta do it
'Cause you can't get enough
You gotta do it
You never give up, no
You got to do it
Gotta do all the stuff that you love
No more turning
When you're down on your luck
You gotta do it
And you're covered in mud
You gotta do it
You still going on, yeah
You got to do it
Gotta do all the stuff that you love

But you left me down so many times and took me back
But I'll never turn around again
And now my life is back
I'm back on the track
And I'll never burn it down again, No
