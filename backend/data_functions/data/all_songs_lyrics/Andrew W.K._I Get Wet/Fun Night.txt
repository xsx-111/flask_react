Fun Night LyricsWe like to play and we do it all day
Because we got no worries
We make what we want
And then we take what we want
Because we're in no hurry
They don't know, where we won't go
'Cause we just like living
'Cause we make what we want
And then we take what we want
'Cause we hit the top
And we won't stop

'Cause we're gonna have a fun night
Gonna get off
And have a fun night
Gonna get off
Won't go away
And we heard what you said
Because we just don't need it
We just wanted fun
And we're gonna get some
And you better believe it
You won't know and we won't fucking go
We just keep on living
We always get what we want
We still get what we want
'Cause we're never gonna stop
No, we won't stop


We get off, 'cause we do what we want
We get off, we get off
'Cause we do what we want
We get off, 'cause we do what we want
We get off, we get off
'Cause we do what we want
We never stop
We get off
