Party Hard Lyrics
When it’s time to party we will party hard
Hey!

You, you work all night (all night!)
And when you work you just feel all right
And when, when things stop feeling all right (all right!)
And everything is all right

‘Cause we will never listen to your rules (No!)
We will never do as others do (No!)
Know what we want and we get it from you
Do what we like and we like what we do

So let’s get a party going (Let’s get a party going!)
Now it’s time to party and we’ll party hard (party hard!)
Let’s get a party going (Let’s get a party going!)
When it’s time to party we will always party hard
Party hard!
(Party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard)
Party hard!
(Party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard)
Party hard!
Aaaaaahhhhh! (Hey! Hey! Hey!)

All right!
You, you fight that fight (that fight)
And when you’re fighting you feel all right (party hard!)
But when, when things stop feeling all right (all right!)
And everything is all right

‘Cause we will never listen to your rules (No!)
We will never do as others do (No!)
We know what we want and we get it from you
We do what we like and we like what we do

So let’s get a party going (Let’s get a party going!)
Now it’s time to party and we’ll party hard (party hard!)
Let’s get a party going (Let’s get a party going!)
When it’s time to party we will always party hard
Party hard!
(Party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard)
Party hard!
(Party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard)
Party hard!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Party hard!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Party hard!6Embed
