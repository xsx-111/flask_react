I Love NYC Lyrics
I love New York City
Oh yeah, New York City
I love New York City
Oh yeah, New York City

Run it over, run them out
Knock your block and terror your town
Move on corners, move around
Talk no talk, breaking you down

We are a corporation
We are a company
We cut high, but we're cuttin' high anyway
We are your mother's father
We are your fighter friend
You can't stop what you can't end

I love New York City
Oh yeah, New York City
I love New York City
Oh yeah, New York City
Broken faces, burning beds
Deal off some from everyone did
Ride on nothin', ride your head
Got no fear, sayin' not said

We are a population
We are a factory
We don't do, but we never did anyway
We are your mother's father
We are your fighter friend
You can't stop what you can't end

I love New York City
Oh yeah, New York City
I love New York City
Oh yeah, New York CityEmbed
