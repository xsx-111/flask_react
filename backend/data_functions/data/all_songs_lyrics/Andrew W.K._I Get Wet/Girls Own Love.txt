Girls Own Love Lyrics
People started killing wherever she goes

When she comes she's a red hot set of lips
And when she comes and you just don't know
She won't try and stop you
But she'd go and kick you when you're down on the ground
She just disappoints you
Even though you give it everything you can
All that you can
You've got to make her understand
That you are a man

You don't stop
She gets what she wants
You don't stop
She gets what she needs
You don't stop
I get what I need
You don't stop
I need your love

You don't stop when they're taking your love
Girls own love
You don't stop when they're making your love
Girls own love
You don't stop when girls own love
Girls own love
You don't stop when girls own love
People started killing wherever she goes

She gets off without you
And when you get it up
She's a puttin' you down
She won't try and stop you
But she'd go and kick you when you're down on the ground
She just disappoints you
Even though you give it everything you can
All that you can
You've got to make her understand
That you are a man

You don't stop
She gets what she wants
You don't stop
She gets what she needs
You don't stop
I get what I need
You don't stop
I need your love

You don't stop when they're taking your love
Girls own love
You don't stop when they're making your love
Girls own love
You don't stop when girls own love
Girls own love
You don't stop when girls own love
Na, na, na
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You don't stop when they're taking your love
Girls own love
You don't stop when they're making your love
Girls own love
You don't stop when girls own love
Girls own love
You don't stop when girls own loveEmbed
