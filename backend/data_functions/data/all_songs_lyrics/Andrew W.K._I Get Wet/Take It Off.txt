Take It Off LyricsTake it off!
Take it off!
Gotta Get ready to go 'cause it's time again
We know we are the ones who'll do it now again
(Don't stop!) Who do you want? You back away again
('Cause mister) what do you got? You got that black on again
We got along
They can't stop me
We've got our own
Take it off me
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Take it off!
We Know When You're Hitting The Rack
We Know When You've Got On Black
We know what you do in the sack
'Cause you, you never look back
We Know When You're Hitting The Rack
We Know When You've Got On Black
We know what you do in the sack
'Cause you, you never look back
You got it all wrong
You're back and running again
And now what do you got?
You got that black on again
They'll never know
They can't stop me
We'll blow our loads
Take it off me
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Take it off!
Take it off!Embed
