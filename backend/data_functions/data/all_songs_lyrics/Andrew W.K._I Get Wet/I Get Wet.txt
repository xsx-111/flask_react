I Get Wet Lyrics
You watch what I say (Watch what I say)
Watch what I do, (Because I)
Really don't care, I really don't care
I know you're tryin' to get somewhere
You watch what you say (Watch what I do)
I'm gonna get on you, (I)
Really don't care, I really don't care
You're never gonna go nowhere

(I get wet)
(I get wet) When the party is dying
(I get wet) Without even trying
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) Whenever you're crying
(I get wet) I know that you're dying
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet

Ahhhh
(You)
You're making wars (You're breaking doors)
And now you're on the floor, (I)
Really don't care, I really don't care
I know you're tryin' to get somewhere
You watch what I say (Watch what I say)
Watch what I do, (Because I)
Really don't care, I really don't care
You're never gonna go nowhere

(I get wet)
(I get wet) When the party is dying
(I get wet) Without even trying (I get wet)
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) When I know that you're dying
(I get wet) Without even trying
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) When I know that you're dying (I get wet)
(I get wet) Without even trying
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet) I get wet
(I get wet)
(I get wet) Whenever you're crying (I get wet)
(I get wet) I know that you're dying (I get wet)
I get wet (x48)Embed
