Heroes LyricsFifteen long years
On a losing streak
And a lot of bodies unburied
And there come a time
You cannot turn the other cheek
You have got to ride the ferry
Past the battered old bodies
Of dead dead dreamers
Past the tethered and fettered desk-bound schemers
Past the punks and the drunks
And the bad guitar players
And the dewy-eyed teenage dragon slayers
You come to this place
Where you can say I just want to work with you
As we do the things that we know we have to do
Ever hopeful and ever blue
We do the things that we know we have to do
And though we all know deep down in our hearts
That someday this will all fall apart
Oh-oh for right now
Hey let's just be heroes
The telegraph man
Took a break today
He pulled out all the wires
He looked out the window at the
Rainy rainy day and he
Wondered about the future of fire
As he leaned back in his chair
With a long cold fishy-eyed stare
He looked like a symbol
Until he remembered
He'd said I just want to work with you
As we do the things that we know we have to do
Ever hopeful and ever blue
We do the things that we know we have to do
And though we both know deep down in our hearts
That someday this will all fall apart
Oh for right now
Hey let's just be heroesEmbed
