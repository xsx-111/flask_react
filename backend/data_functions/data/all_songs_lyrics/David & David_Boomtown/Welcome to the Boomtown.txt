Welcome to the Boomtown LyricsMiss Cristina drives a 944
Satisfaction oozes from her pores
She keeps rings on her fingers
Marble on her floor
Cocaine in her dresser
Bars on her doors
She keeps her back against the wall
She keeps her back against the wall
So I say
I say welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
Pick a habit
We got plenty to go around
Welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
All that money makes
Such a succulent sound
Welcome to the boomtown
Handsome Kevin
Got a little off track
Took a year off from college
And he never went back
Now he smokes much too much
Got a permanent hack
Deals dope out of Denny's
Keeps a table in the back
He always listens to low ground
Always listens to low ground
So I say
I say welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
Pick a habit
We got plenty to go around
Welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
All that money makes
Such a succulent sound
Welcome to the boomtown
Well, the ambulance arrived too late
I guess she didn't want to wait
So I say
I say welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
Pick a habit
We got plenty to go around
Welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
All that money makes
Such a succulent sound
Welcome to the boomtown
Welcome to the boomtown
Welcome to the boomtownEmbed
