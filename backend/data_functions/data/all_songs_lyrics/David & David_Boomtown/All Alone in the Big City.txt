All Alone in the Big City LyricsStrange girl fingers send a
Shiver up my thighs
She speak in tongues when she
Looks into my eyes
She'll claw my back up
Just to get a rise
But when I tell her about my problems
She don't sympathize
She says we're
All alone in the big city
Living all alone in the big city
O violence tempting violence
We try to make it count
Sensations rise as
The doubt begins to mount
A quality performance is
What it's all about
Rock and roll is easy
It's love that you surmount
You see we're
All alone in the big cityEmbed
