Swimming in the Ocean LyricsJust for a night
I'll watch from above
The too-late rites
For a long dead love
Just for a night
I'll watch from above
The too-late rite
For a long dead love
Making like defrocked priests
Going through the motions
A double-backed beast
Without the holy lotions
Generate heat
But move without emotion
An athletic feat
Like swimming in the ocean
I really did
Swim in itEmbed
