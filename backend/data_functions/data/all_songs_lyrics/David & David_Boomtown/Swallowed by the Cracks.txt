Swallowed by the Cracks LyricsI once was a dancer
I was young once like you
Though I know I don't look it
Jumped high as the sky
Had fire in my eyes
Had legs like a stallion
And I had a girl and I loved her, oh
My best friend was her brother
We were on top of the mountain that summer
We thought we'd never be swallowed by the cracks
Fallen so far down
Like the rest of those clowns begging bus fare back
Swallowed by the cracks
Our pride worn down talking times gone by
Like everybody else
Swallowed by the cracks
Swallowed by the cracks
We'd never be swallowed by the cracks
We would talk through the night
About what we would do
If we just could get started
I would choreograph
Eileen she would act while
Steve was a writer
Then Stevie ran away and get bored
Eileen took a job in a store
While I became this drunken old whore
Cause you see we'd be swallowed by the cracks
Fallen so far down
Like the rest of those clowns begging bus fare back
Swallowed by the cracks our pride worn down
Talking times gone by like everybody else
Swallowed by the cracks
Swallowed by the cracks
Maybe it ain't over
I can see it's up to me
You're only out when you stay out
You stay out when you don't believe
We could drive around in circles
Getting nowhere all night long
Getting drunk with strangers telling lies
And singing along with the jukebox baby
Swallowed by the cracks
Fallen so far down
Like the rest of those clowns begging bus fare back
Swallowed by the cracks
Our pride worn down talking times gone by
Like everybody else
Swallowed by the cracks
Swallowed by the cracks
You see we'd been swallowed by the cracksEmbed
