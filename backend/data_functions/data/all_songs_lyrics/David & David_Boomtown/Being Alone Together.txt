Being Alone Together LyricsGood morning honey
Did you sleep okay
It certainly looks as though
It's gonna be a beautiful day
By the way
Can you see that I'm slipping away
Just pass my shirt darling
I can't be late today
Ladahoo
Being alone together
Making talk about the weather
Ladahoo
Being alone together
No this can't go on forever
There's so much work to do
Cleaning up this place
All those souvenirs
Taking up closet space
She stands in the doorway
Hot tears rolling down her face
It don't feel right for her
To be alone around the place
Ladahoo
Being alone together
Making talk about the weather
Ladahoo
Being alone together
No this can't go on forever
Forever
Forever
Oh no no
And my little sister told me
She said I'm better off this way
She said my future's all that matters
And if I'm just a little bit tattered
Still I'm better off
I'm better off this way
I'm better off this way?
She thought I was a hero
Tee hee hee
I thought she was a goddess
Foolish me
Ladahoo
Being alone together
Making talk about the weather
Ladahoo
Being alone together
No this can't go on foreverEmbed
