My World Lyrics
You want to step into my world?
It's a socio-psychotic state of bliss
You've been delayed in the real world
How many times have you hit and missed?
Your cat-scan shows dis-figuration
I want to laugh myself to death
With a misfired synapse, with a bent configuration
I'll hold the line, while you gasp for breath

You wanna talk to me? (So talk to me)
You wanna talk to me? (So talk to me)
You wanna talk to me? (So talk to me)
You wanna talk to me? (You can't talk to me)
You wanna talk to me? (Don't understand your sex)
You wanna talk to me? (You ain't been mind-fucked yet)

Let's do it
Let's do it
Let's do it
Oh, my distorted smile
Guess what I'm doin' now, uh3Embed
