Bonfire Lyrics
Take me to your leader
Show me how you play
I'll never go away
Show me how your fingers
Got in all those pies
I'll never go away

We'll start a bonfire
We'll start a bonfire
We'll start a bonfire
We'll start a bonfire

We'll start a bonfire to make the time fly
'Cause I'm so bored I could burn this whole town
We'll start a bonfire to make the time fly by
'Cause I'm so bored I could burn this whole town

CrÃªpe Suzette and lemon
That burning in your eyes
There's nothing in your mind
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
We'll start a bonfire to make the time fly
'Cause I'm so bored I could burn this whole town
We'll start a bonfire to make the time fly by
'Cause I'm so bored I could burn this whole town

And if you wanted to make me cry
You might be the last
And if you want me to wake, revive
Blow smoke up my arse

We'll start a bonfire to make the time fly
'Cause I'm so bored I could burn this whole town
We'll start a bonfire to make the time fly by
'Cause I'm so bored I could burn this whole town

Oh come inside, you're mine, I'll find you
(We'll find you, we'll find you)
Tailor chalk me up I'm fraying
(We'll find you, we'll find you)Embed
