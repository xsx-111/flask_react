Silent Movie Susie Lyrics
Susie's gone
Are you gonna save me?
Am I gonna come? Come on
Do something amazing
Never gonna scream
In a silent movie scene

(Come back for the summer)
Come
(Come back for the summer)
Don't leave me on my own
(Come back for the summer)
Don't leave me on my own
Woo, she's g-g-g-gone
Woo, she's g-g-g-gone

Winter, Spring, so long
But lazy Susie's gone
What did I do wrong?
All we know is we don't know
For all your charms, it's honestly
Just hands on screen in a silent movie scene
(Come back for the summer)
Come
(Come back for the summer)
Don't leave me on my own
(Come back for the summer)
Don't leave me on my own
Woo, she's g-g-g-gone
Woo, she's g-g-g-gone
Woo, woo

Susie, come back, Susie
Come back, Susie
Come back

(Come back for the summer)
Come
(Come back for the summer)
Don't leave me on my own
(Come back for the summer)
Don't leave me on my own
(Come back for the summer)
Don't leave me on my own
Woo, woo, woo, wooEmbed
