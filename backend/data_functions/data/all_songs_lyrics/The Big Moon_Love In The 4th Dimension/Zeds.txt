Zeds LyricsHoney, do you think of me when you're
Blowing bubbles through the window?
I try my hardest to get off to sleep
But oh, you win, you're worth losing zeds for
You move me, what telekinesis is this?
Could never sate my appetite
I open books and just stare at the words
Night after night
All the town's out for the count
But you're still sparking a light up
And I'm bootlacing up for somnambulating
Cos you're still stoking a fire in me
Queasy
With the whale music
And I'm sick of the sheep I've been counting
I open books and just stare at the words
Night after night
Everybody's sleeping sound
All the town's out for the count
But you're still sparking a light up
And I'm bootlacing up for somnambulating
Cos you're still stoking a fire in me
Night after night
All the town's out for the count
But you're still sparking a light up
And I'm bootlacing up for somnambulating
Cos you're still stoking a fire in meEmbed
