Happy New Year Lyrics
I like to lose my mind
Rip things off the map
Hours of minus time
Paint my memory black

'Cause I'm never gonna be this young
And everything I do one day will just be done

So I don't remember
(Happy new year)
Bringing in the new year
(Happy new year)
No I don't remember
(Happy new year)
I'm happy to lie with the sleeping dogs

I'd love to tell the tale
But my memory is
Like trying to push an elephant through a sieve

'Cause I'm never gonna be this young
And everything I sing one day will just be sung
So I don't remember
(Happy new year)
Bringing in the new year
(Happy new year)
No I don't remember
(Happy new year)
I'm happy to lie with the sleeping dogs

I'd love to eulogise but my memory's, well
As grey as a garden snail
And doesn't stick so well

But I'm never gonna be this young
And everything I love one day will just be
Never gonna be this young
And everything I love one day will just be loved

So I don't remember
(Happy new year)
Bringing in the new year
(Happy new year)
No I don't remember
(Happy new year)
Bringing in the new year
(Happy new year)
Oh I don't remember
(Happy new year)
I'm happy to lie with the sleeping dogs
Happy new year
Happy new year
Happy new year
Happy new yearEmbed
