Pull The Other One Lyrics
When I was young I told myself I wouldn't have a problem
When people tried to get under my skin
You're banging on the door, I hear you screaming hell for leather
But there is just no way I'd let you in

I'll call you in the day
I'll tie you in a bow

Pull the other one
Pull the other one
Baby

When you got me roses, I just couldn't bear to see them
I had to hide them behind the settee
I've washed my hair so many times that all the ends are splitting
There must be something wrong with me

I might have other plans
It's all out of my hands

Pull the other one
Pull the other one
Pull the other one
Pull the other one
Baby
Finally you're here with me
And will you stay the night?
I'd like to let you stay the day
But my schedule's very tight

Pull the other one
Pull the other one
Pull the other one
Pull the other one
Pull the other one
Pull the other one
Pull the other one
Pull the other oneEmbed
