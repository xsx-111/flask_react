The Road Lyrics
Throw me a bone
The night it trickles like the sleeping sand
And the road's in my hands
This old heel gets stuck in every drain

Tell me why you came
'Cause I don’t know why
People can change
I know I’m not the same
And heaven help me now
I’ve got no good reason to stay
I know I’m not the same

Time hanging limp
It silks around in wispy spider strands
Thought I could tame you, my man
Now I can see you through your lion’s mane

Tell me why you came
'Cause I don’t know why
People can change
I know I’m not the same
And heaven help me now
I’ve got no good reason to stay
I know I’m not the same

Tell me why you came
'Cause I don’t know why
People can change
I know I’m not the same
And heaven help me now
I’ve got no good reason to stay
I know I’m not the sameEmbed
