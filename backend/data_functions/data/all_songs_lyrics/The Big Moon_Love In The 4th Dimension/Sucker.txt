Sucker Lyrics
You were in my bed
I heard what you said
Well you were in my bed
So I heard what you said

Should we nip this bud?
Can we give this up?
We're not wasting time
I'm with you for life

And it got colder every day
But I wouldn't change my mind
It got darker every night
But I wouldn't change my mind

Should we nip this bud?
Can we give this up?
We're not wasting time
I'm with you for life

And it got colder every day
But I wouldn't change my mind
It got darker every night
But I wouldn't change my mind
I never thought that you would become my greatest friend
I never thought that you would become my greatest friend

And it got colder every day
But I wouldn't change my mind
It got darker every night
But I wouldn't change my mind
I'm a sucker for you
I'm a sucker for youEmbed
