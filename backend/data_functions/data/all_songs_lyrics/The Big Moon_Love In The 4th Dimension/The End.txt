The End LyricsBoy I'm afraid I'm falling for you
Dig me a hole to crumble into
Why should this be happening now?
I wanted to be free
Just for a month or two
But now there's something in the air
I never even cared before
Boy I'm afraid this may be the end
My iron will has started to bend
Why should this be happening now?
The rug beneath my feet is pulling under me
Cos now there's something in the air
I never even cared
Before the days were so long
I know
But now those days are long gone
I know
And it freaks me out
I just don't know what to do
Boy I'm scrambled
My TV's a fuzz
Watershed thrills
My heart beats a buzz
Why should this be happening now?
Where I once used to bite
My fangs are falling out
Cos now there's something in the air
I never even cared
Before the days were so long
I know
And now those days are long gone
I know
And it freaks me out
I just don't know what to do
I'm melting
I'm melting
I'm melting
I'm melting
I'm melting
I'm melting
I'm melting
I'm melting over youEmbed
