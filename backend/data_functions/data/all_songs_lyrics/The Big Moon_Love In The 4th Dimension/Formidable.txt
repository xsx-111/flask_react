Formidable Lyrics
Love you've got an island to sink
Better leave the boat capsizing
Oh, ruminate in passionate sleep
Better be a new sun rising

Did she make you swallow all your pride?
Does the love still shiver down your spine?

Hi, I'm not invisible
I'm on your side
I'll be formidable
I'll be formidable

Yeah let me heal your battle scars
Run my ship to ground
Yeah nothing is gonna take me down
Give me everything you got
Let your heart beat loud
Yeah nothing could turn me round

Hi, I'm not invisible
I'm on your side
I'll be formidable
I'll be formidable
I'll be formidable
I'll be formidable1Embed
