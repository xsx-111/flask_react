Good Luck In Jail LyricsC'mon over to my house, yea. We'll work on my car
Just got some more duck tape, I got the parts
Payload, speed boat
Wanna come along
Vice grip, guilt trip
Don't get me wrong
I can sleep standing up, and still look awake
For 6 bucks an hour, for 8 hours a day
Where's all my money go an hour after I get paid?
I can get the girl wired but I can't make her stay
Lean down, swing down
Don't be too long
Vice grip, guilt trip
Don't get me wrong
Quiet ... when I'm here alone
I need somebody I can talk to, but I think I broke the phone
I said good luck in jail the last time I called home
I need somebody I can talk to, but I think I broke the phoneEmbed
