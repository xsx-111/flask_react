Future Home of Stucco Monstrosity LyricsGotta cough, got the sniffles
Saw a doctor, got a match
Got a hammer, got a nail
Gotta casket, got a match
Got a green card, got a hassle
Took a beatin' got a match
Hey man, hey man, hey man, gotta match?
Tell yer ma, tell yer pa, our loves gonna grow
It's a government building and the hatchet job i know, i know
Every single cinderblock they all gonna blow
Tell your ma tell your pa our love's gonna growEmbed
