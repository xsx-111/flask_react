O Pencil Sharp LyricsO' pencil sharp, pencil dull, pencil drag, pencil pull, gonna pencil poke
Ya' to the floor, gonna pencil f**k, gonna pencil whore, o' pencil vuture
Pencil dove, pencil kisses, pencil cove, pencil drop, down from above
Spittin' pencil bullets pencil slugs... yeah... o' pencil now, pencil then
Long before ya had a pen, gonna stab and stick man, gonna pencil gore, o'
Pencil get the response, the one he looking for, to erase is of no avail
Pointy pencil will prevail, slippery the pencil slide, swiftly the pencil
Sail. - C'mon won't ya...Embed
