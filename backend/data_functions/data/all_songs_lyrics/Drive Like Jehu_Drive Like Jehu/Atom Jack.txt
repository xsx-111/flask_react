Atom Jack LyricsRats, handfulla silvers
I just wanted to hop your fence
I wanted to wade, I wanted to wallow
I wanted somebody to rub my neck
Yeah, you should be happy to see me
Be glad that I'm not dead
I took your bullet, anyone notice?
No one was thrilled to see me again
Dream your dreams
You'll wanna take them back
Nobody gives a fuck about what you see
You split your last atom, Atom JackEmbed
