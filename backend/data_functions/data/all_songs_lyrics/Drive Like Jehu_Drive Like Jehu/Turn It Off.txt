Turn It Off LyricsTurn
It off
Wipe that look off your face
Turn
It off
Look what you done to this place
Yer flawless sense of timing
You got so many lines
The faucet just keeps on running
Water down in style
Turn
It off
Turn
It off
Ya know the soft answer
From a thinkin' man
Makes for the softest landing
Turn away a whole flock of wrath
But when yer plumbing backs up
You're gonna drink it down
Where ya gonna shack up?
Who's yer landlord now?Embed
