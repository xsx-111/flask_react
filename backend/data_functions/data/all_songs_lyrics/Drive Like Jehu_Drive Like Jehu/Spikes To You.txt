Spikes To You Lyrics'A' frames, statuettes, sunset magazine
They're lining up to do their jobs but i swear to god i seen:
Bits and guts and pieces hanging from the trees
Stumpy mow the lawn, c'mon, ya gotta bare piece a' ground
Pour some concrete, buy a sofa, lay yer body down
Your kids are fucking in your garbage
They're waiting for your job
Got the mouths around your paycheck
Got joyticks for your sawsEmbed
