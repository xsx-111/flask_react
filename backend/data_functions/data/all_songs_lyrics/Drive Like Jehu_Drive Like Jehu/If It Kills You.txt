If It Kills You LyricsYour 47th birthday cake
Is bleeding acid on your face
Light a candle
It won't light your fire
Every bad thing that you hate
Piling higher on your plate
If you ain't starving, you ain't satisfied
Learn to relax, if it kills you
You had your chance, hold on
'Cause it's gone
Sometimes I'm a mangler
Sometimes I sleep on it
Sometimes I'm a hamburger
Sometimes I dream of itEmbed
