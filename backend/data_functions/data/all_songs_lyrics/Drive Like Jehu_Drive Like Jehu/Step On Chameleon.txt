Step On Chameleon LyricsYou wanna fist, you wanna ride
Go to school so you can hide
Step on the bus be rewarded
Get off last & yer retarded
Last off, last in line
Chameleon doin' fine
Second hand will tick
Pancake batter gettin' thick
Cut my finger on a butter knife
Watch the blood flow down just like
The blood i see on yer hands
Bloody foot print swollen tongue
Scaly skidmark better run
Bitter swallow get you numb
What is gold? SilverbulletsEmbed
