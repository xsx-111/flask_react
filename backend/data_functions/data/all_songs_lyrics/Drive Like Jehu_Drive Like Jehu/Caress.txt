Caress LyricsGracie, we're makin babies, yea, we're barefoot on the tiles
We make 'em soft and small and tender
It's the biggest hazard of your gender
Gotta hold it by yourself
Gracie, hold yourself together, it's bad now but it gets better
We're all here to help
Everything is swollen, everything is swell... everybody's watching
They all wanna see it kick
Pleasure is your crime, junior is your punishment
Happens all the time, everybody rub it in
It ain't hard to find fault in any thing you do
We learned to love the hard way, you're gonna learn it tooEmbed
