Closing Arguments (Skit) Lyrics
 In closing, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm not gonna sit here and bore you with a long, drawn-out story or excuse, of why I think Wyclef is guilty. I'm gonna stand by the exhibits as well as the tapes and songs such as Jeopardy, 'Til Novemeber, All the Girls, and Bubblegoose, which stand side by side with my allegations. I rest my case
 Okay, uhm, uh, ladies, and gentlemen, of the jury, as you can see nothing has been proven here today. These witnesses they brought here do not have evidence to incriminate my client, eh? If he's not guilty, he's innocent. If he's not detrimental to the society, therefore he positive! As I said before, this case is pure bishop!
 Your honor see, this, this is exactly what I'm talking about. I mean I've been meaning to ask this the whole time. Who the hell is Bishop?
 Eh?
 And, and why the hell hasn't he been brought on the stand?
 Bishop, bishop, not true, false, bishop
 Oh, bullshit!
 Oui!Embed
