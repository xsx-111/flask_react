The Last of the Famous International Playboys Lyrics
Dear hero imprisoned
With all the new crimes that you are perfecting
Oh, I can't help quoting you
Because everything that you said rings true
And now in my cell (well, I followed you)
And here's a list of who I slew
Reggie Kray - do you know my name?
Oh, don't say you don't
Please say you do, (oh, oh)
I am

The last of the famous
International playboys
The last of the famous
International playboys

And in my cell (well, I loved you)
And every man with a job to do
Ronnie Kray - do you know my face?
Oh, don't say you don't
Please say you do, (oh, oh)
I am
The last of the famous
International playboys
The last of the famous
International playboys

In our lifetime those who kill
The news world hands them stardom
And these are the ways
On which I was raised
These are the ways
On which I was, which I was raised
I never wanted to kill
I am not naturally evil
Such things I do
Just to make myself
More attractive to you
Have I failed?
Oh...
Oooh, oooh, yeaah, nooo, nooo (pa ramp-amp-amp)
Nooo, nooo, yeaah, yeaah, nooo (pa ramp-amp-amp)
Nooo, nooo, yeaah, nooo, yeaah (pa ramp-amp-amp)
Nooo, nooo, yeaah, nooo, yeaah
Oooh
The last of the famous
International playboys
The last of the famous
