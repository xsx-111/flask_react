Disappointed Lyrics
Our unsleepable friend
Gets the message on an ill-wind
All your friends and your foes
Would rather die than have to touch you
To say the least, truly disappointed
Truly, truly, truly ah-ha-ha

Drank too much
And I've said too much
And there's nowhere to go, but down
Young boy, I wanna help you
See these lines? Truly disappointed
Truly, truly, truly ah-ha-ha

Don't talk to me now
About people who are nice
'Cause I have spent my whole life in ruins
Because of people who were nice
Oh, this world may lack style, I know
Each bud must blossom and grow

Young girl one day you will be old
But the thing is, I love you now
This is the last song I will ever sing (Yeah)
No, I've changed my mind again (Ooooh)
Goodnight and thank youEmbed
