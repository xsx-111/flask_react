Lifeguard On Duty Lyrics
The work you chose has a practical vein
But I read much more into your name

Lifeguard
Patrolling the lenght and the breadth of your pool
I call your name from the vestibule
Lifeguard
Lifeguard - save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from the ails and the ills, and
From other things

The center of the town is a dangerous zone
Drenched in phlegm every time that I come home

Lifeguard - save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from the ails and the ills
And from other things
Love me, oh help me, oh
Oh help me, oh help oh
Lifeguard, guard me from life
Lifeguard, guard me from life
The last bus home is the dangerous one
A baseball bat across the collarbone

Lifeguard, lifeguard, save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from life
'Cause it's the only life I'll ever have
I'm always good, I'm never bad
And I've always been so kind
To the sick and to the partially blind
Save me from lifeEmbed
