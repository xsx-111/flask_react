Oh Phoney LyricsMay this lovely letter
Reach its destination
If only
Question one is why do you
Pretend that you like me?
Oh phoney
See how the outside
Contradicts what's inside
Oooooh ooh
Who can make Hitler
Seem like a bus conductor?
You do, oh phoney you do
You sing a lovely song to a scale
And the words spell out my name
Oh phoney
But then you kick me down below
'Cause you know it won't show
How could you?
See how the outside
Contradicts what's inside
Oooooh ooh
Who can make Hitler
Seem like a bus conductor?
You do oh phoney oh phoney you do
You do oh phoney oh phoney you do
You do oh phoney oh phoney you doEmbed
