Everyday Is Like Sunday Lyrics
Trudging slowly over wet sand
Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
This is the coastal town
That they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come, Armageddon! Come!

Every day is like Sunday
Every day is silent and grey

Hide on the promenade
Etch a postcard:
"How I Dearly Wish I Was Not Here"
In the seaside town
That they forgot to bomb
Come, come, come, nuclear bomb

Every day is like Sunday
Every day is silent and grey

Trudging back over pebbles and sand
And a strange dust lands on your hands
And on your face...
On your face...
On your face...
On your face...
Every day is like Sunday
"Win yourself a cheap tray"
Share some greased tea with me
Every day is silent and grey11Embed
