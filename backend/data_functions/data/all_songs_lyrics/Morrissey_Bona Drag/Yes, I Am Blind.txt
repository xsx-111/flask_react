Yes, I Am Blind Lyrics
Yes, I am blind
No, I can't see
The good things
Just the bad things, oh...
Yes, I am blind
No, I can't see
There must be something
Horribly wrong with me?

God, come down if you're really there
Well, you're the one who claims to care

Love's young dream
I'm the one who shot you
I'm the one who stopped you
'Cause in my sorry way I love you
Love's young dream
Are you sorry for what you've done?
Well, you're not the only one
And in my sorry way I love you
Yes, I am blind
But I do see
Evil people prosper
Over the likes of you and me, always!

God, come down if you're really there
Well, you're the one who claims to care

Little lamb
On a hill
Run fast if you can
Good Christians, they wanna kill you
And your life has not even begun
You're just like me, you're just like me
Oh, your life has not even begun
You're just like me, you're just like me
And your life has not even begun
You're just like me, just like me
And your life has not even begun
You're just like me, you're just like, just like me
And your life has not even begunEmbed
