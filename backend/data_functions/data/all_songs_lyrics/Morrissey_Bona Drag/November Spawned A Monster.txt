November Spawned A Monster Lyrics
Sleep on and dream of love
Because it's the closest you will get to love
Poor, twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
Poor, twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me

One November spawned a monster
In the shape of this child, who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me
From pity, sympathy, and people discussing me
A frame of useless limbs what can make good
All the bad that's been done?"

And if the lights were out
Could you even bear to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
Poor, twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
Poor, twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me

One November spawned a monster
In the shape of this child who must remain
A hostage to kindness and the wheels underneath her
A hostage to kindness and the wheels underneath her
A symbol of where mad, mad lovers must pause and draw the line

So sleep and dream of love
Because it's the closest you will get to love

That November is a time which I must put out of my mind
Oh, one fine day, let it be soon
She won't be rich or beautiful
But she'll be walking your streets
In the clothes that she went out and chose for herself3Embed
