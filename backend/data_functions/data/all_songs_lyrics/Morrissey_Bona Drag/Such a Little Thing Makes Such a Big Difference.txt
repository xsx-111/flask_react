Such a Little Thing Makes Such a Big Difference Lyrics
Such a little thing
Such a little thing
But the difference it made was grave
There you go
Wielding a bicycle chain
Oh, why won't you change?
Change and be nice, oh...

Such a little thing
A gentle tone of kindness
Or written words on paper - can you write?
How I love all of
The very simple things of life
God's good air
How I love all of
The very simple things of life

Such a little thing
A fumbling politeness, oh...
Oh, the difference saved me
Wielding a bicycle chain
Why won't you change?
"I will not change
And I will not be nice"
Most people keep their brains
Between their legs
(Don't you find?)

Leave me alone, I was only singing
Leave me alone, because I was only singing
Leave me alone, I was only singing
Leave me alone, you have just proved again
Most people keep their brains
Between their legsEmbed
