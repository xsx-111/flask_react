Will Never Marry Lyrics
I'm writing this to say, in a gentle way, thank you, but no
I will live my life as I will undoubtedly die alone

I'm writing this to say, in a gentle way, thank you
I will live my life as Iâ€¦ ohhh
For whether you stay or you stray
An in-built guilt catches up with you
And as it comes around to your place
At 5am, wakes you up and it laughs in your faceEmbed
