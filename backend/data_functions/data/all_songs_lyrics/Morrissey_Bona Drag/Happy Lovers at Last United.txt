Happy Lovers at Last United Lyrics
Happy lovers, back together
Uh, and I do feel proud
Happy lovers, reunited
Uh, and I do feel proud now
I'm not the type to boast as you know
Though it was me who brought them back together

He is so kind, and she is so clever
But they don't want me now
Hanging around
Happy lovers, at last, at last, united
Happy lovers at last, united

I rang to her to explain of how
He really wants to see you again
I said more or less the same thing to
Him too, which wasn't true
And now they walk, hand in hand
All is planned, with the silent glance
I believe that only lovers share
And I'm proud to have done
Something good for once
'Cause she is so kind, and he's so clever
But they don't need me now
Hanging around
Happy lovers, at last, at last united
Happy lovers, at last united
Oh, happy lovers, at last united
Oh, happy lovers, at last, at last, at last unitedEmbed
