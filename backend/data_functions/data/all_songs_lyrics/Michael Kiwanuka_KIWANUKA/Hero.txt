Hero LyricsAm I a hero?
Am I a hero now?
Am I a hero?
Am I a hero now?
Yeah
Please don't shoot me down
I loved you like a brother
It's on the news again
I guess they killed another
Am I a hero?
Am I a hero now?
To die a hero
Is all that we know now
Oh, we all get told to go along
Oh, we know it's all for show
We know, we know
Am I a hero?
Am I a hero now?
To die a hero
Is all that we know now
Yeah
(Ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah)
Am I a hero?
A fallen hero now?
Hear my sin, Lord
Speak no evil now
My amigo
No gun to reload now
A broken people
There go a negro now2Embed
