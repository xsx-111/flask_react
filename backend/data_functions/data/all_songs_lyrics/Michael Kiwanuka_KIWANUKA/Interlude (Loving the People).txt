Interlude (Loving the People) Lyrics
A moving feeling within me
That I was sitting there demanding a God-given right
And my soul became satisfied that I was right in what I was doing
At the same time there was something deep down within me
Moving me
That I could no longer be satisfied or go along with an evil system
That I had to be maladjusted to
And in spite of all of this, I had to keep loving the people
Who denied me service
Who stared at meEmbed
