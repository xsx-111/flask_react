Hard to Say Goodbye Lyrics
Little butterfly without wings, how do you fly?
You're holdin' on so tight that you don't even try
And if I had a dream (If I had)
What would be sunshine for me
You are my air to breathe
You're just like honey to a bee

Better believe I'll be back
It's hard to say goodbye
Better believe I'll be back
It gets you every time

When you appeared to me, you let me know what love could be
You gave me confidence, you showed me light, you stayed with me
It's you I'm dreamin' of (You I'm dreamin' of)
Night and day when I contemplate
You are my everything
I'm standin' with you, you are my heart

Better believe I'll be back
It's hard to say goodbye
Better believe I'll be back
It gets you every time
Better believe I'll be back
It's hard to say goodbye
I feel it all around, there's a fire in my spirit
Needing you around 'cause I'm down tonight
Feelin' like a clown 'cause I'm cryin' every minute
We'll get by tonight, we'll get by tonight

Better believe I'll be back (Whoa, whoa)
It's hard to say goodbye
Better believe I'll be back (Whoa, whoa)
It gets me every timeEmbed
