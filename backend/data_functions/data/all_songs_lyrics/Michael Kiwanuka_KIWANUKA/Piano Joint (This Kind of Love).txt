Piano Joint (This Kind of Love) Lyrics
Walking down the avenue
Looking out for something new
It's the right time to give in
The right time to lose
To begin again
Maybe win again

All I want is to talk to you
Turn me onto something true
I can't be with another
And though I've been used
I won't leave again
Help me to the end

All I know is my, oh my, this kind of love
Has taken me from my enemies
Don't let the pressure get to me
My, oh my, it's bad enough
Could you stay with me? Don't let me go
Sadness and fury is all I know

You've taken me from my enemies
I still let the pressure get to me
I thought I could break away
I hope I fall in love today
No more heartbreak and trouble
And though I've been bruised
Let me in again
I could use a friend

All I know is my, oh my, this kind of love
Has taken me from my enemies
Don't let the pressure get to me
My, oh my, it's bad enough
Could you stay with me? Don't let me go
Sadness and fury is all I know

You've taken me from my enemies
I still let the pressure get to me2Embed
