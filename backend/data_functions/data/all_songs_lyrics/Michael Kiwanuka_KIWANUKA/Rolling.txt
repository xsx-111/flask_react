Rolling LyricsNo tears for the young
A bullet if you run away
Another lost one
Like father, like son, we pray
Rolling with the times
Don't be late
Rolling with the times (Rolling)
Don't be late
Phantom pain in your arm
Tryna make a mark and change
It's tearing you apart
Afraid of the darker days
Rolling with the times
Don't be late
Rolling with the times (Rolling)
Don't be late
Don't be late
Yeah, rolling with the times
Don't be late
Roll on down
Don't be late now
Stay on down (Rolling)
Rolling with the times, rolling with the times, yeah
Won't you roll? Won't you stay around town?
Oh, gotta be on (Rolling)Embed
