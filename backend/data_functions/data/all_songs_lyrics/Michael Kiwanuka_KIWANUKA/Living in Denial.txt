Living in Denial LyricsThey'll watch you fall, break your heart, watch you bleedin'
You gots to fall with me
It gets too far when you need paranoia
Don't bother me, yeah
Done tryin' to play the fool, don't you?
You're finding out your heart is out of bounds, yeah
And hiding from the truth won't last
Talk about dealing in the past
Don't apologize
It's not enough just to cause a reaction
Who you tryna please?
Know applause come before satisfaction
Say what you mean, yeah
I guess you heard the news, baby
Findin' out it ain't really all about, yeah
'Bout playin' by the rules, baby
Talk about livin' in denial
And you try and try
Fallin' in and out of love
Did you ever give enough love?
Are you really givin' up?
Are you really gonna stop right now? (Right now)
I've been livin' in denial
Livin' in denial
I've been livin' in denial
Livin' in denial
I've been livin' in denialEmbed
