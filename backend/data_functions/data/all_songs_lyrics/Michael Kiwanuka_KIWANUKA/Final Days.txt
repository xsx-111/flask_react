Final Days Lyrics
Lying on the ground
Feeling like a dyin' man
No reality
Fading memories
Following the crowd
Coulda been a stronger man
Plead insanity
I will die in these

Final days on the planet
Here we are, on the ground
Every day, automatic
Here we are, goin' 'round and 'round and 'round

Cryin' on the phone
Tryin' to make you understand
Livin' honestly
Is so hard for me
Such a heavy load
You know I really need a friend
You should walk with me
We belong in these
Final days on the planet
Here we are, on the ground
Every day, automatic
Here we are, goin' 'round
Final days on the planet
Failing arms, breaking down
Every day, automatic
Here we are, goin' 'round and 'round and 'round1Embed
