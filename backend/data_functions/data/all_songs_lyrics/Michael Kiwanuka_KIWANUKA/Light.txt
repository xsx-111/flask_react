Light Lyrics
We're miles apart
But safe from dreams
You're running from
Beyond the dawn
We'll always need
One of their own
To lead

(Shine your light over me)
Shine your light over me
(All of my fears are gone)
All of my fears are gone, baby, gone, gone
(And it don't bother me)
And it don't bother me, don't bother me, no
(If it's not meant to be)

Too far to run
Fall on your knees
To find a love
You're light to me
My only sun
You'll always shine
For me
(Shine your light over me)
Shine your light over me
(All of my fears are gone)
All of my fears are gone, baby, gone, gone
(And it don't bother me)
Don't bother me, don't bother me, no
If it's not meant to be
(Shine your light over me)
Shine your light over me
(All of my fears are gone)
All of my fears are gone, baby, gone, gone
(And it don't bother me)
It don't bother me, don't bother me, no
If it's not meant to be

I had to lose to understand
Strung out from all this
Pour out a thousand tears
I never knew a kinder man

A mile apart, leave and be free
A mile apart, leave and be free
A mile apart, leave and be free
A mile apart, leave and be free
A mile apart, leave and be free
A mile apart, leave and be free
A mile apart, leave and be free
A mile apart, leave and be freeEmbed
