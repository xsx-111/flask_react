Sunrise Lyrics
Ah, Ah
Oh

Sunrise
And the new day's breaking through
The morning of another day without you
And as the hours roll by
No one's there to see me cry
Except the sunrise
The sunrise and you
Ah, Ah
Oh

Tired eyes drift across the shore
Looking for love and nothing more
But as the sea rolls by
There's one there to see me cry
Except the sunrise
The sunrise and you

Sunrise, bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again, oh
Sunrise, new day heed my song
I'm tired of fighting and fooling around
But from now till' who knows when
My sword will be my pen
And I'll love you, love ya
For all of my time, yeah

Sunrise, bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again
Sunrise, bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again
Sunrise, bless my eyes
Catch my soul
And make me whole again
