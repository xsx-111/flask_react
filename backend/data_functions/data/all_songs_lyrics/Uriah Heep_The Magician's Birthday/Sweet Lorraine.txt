Sweet Lorraine Lyrics
Wouldn't you like to take this magic potion with me?
On a trip to a cosmic playground far beyond?
She understands, she's been before
It's in her hands to find the door

Sweet Lorraine, let the party carry on
You and I will swim the sea
Sweet Lorraine, let the party carry on
You and I can feel the breeze

There is no time, no wealth, only I surround you
The fortune of this guide is simply sincerity
She understands, 'cause she's been before
It's in her hands to find the door

So Sweet Lorraine, let the party carry on
You and I will swim the sea
Sweet Lorraine, let the party carry on
You and I can feel the breeze

Sweet Lorraine, let the party carry on
You and I will swim the sea
Sweet Lorraine, let the party carry on
You and I can feel the breeze
So Sweet Lorraine, let the party carry on
You and I will swim the sea
Sweet Lorraine, let the party carry on
You and I can feel the breeze

Sweet Lorraine
Sweet Lorraine
Sweet Lorraine, oh
Sweet Lorraine, oh
Sweet Lorraine
