Rain Lyrics
It's raining outside, but that's not unusual
But the way that I'm feelings becoming usual
I guess you could say
The clouds are moving away
Away from your days
And into mine

Now it's raining inside, it's kind of a shame
And it's getting to me, a happy man
And why should you want to
Waste all my time
The world is yours
But I am mine

Rain, rain, rain, in my tears
Measuring carefully my years
Shame, shame, shame, in my mind
See what you've done to my life

Rain, rain, rain, in my tears
Measuring carefully my years
Shame, shame, shame, in my mind
See what you've done to my life
See what you've done to my lifeEmbed
