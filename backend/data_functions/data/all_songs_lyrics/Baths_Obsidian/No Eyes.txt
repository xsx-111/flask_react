No Eyes Lyrics
You take me and I'll take you
In the pit there in the smoke
I can never make out your face, or at least I can't remember it
I have no eyes, I have no love, I have no hope

And it is not a matter of
If you mean it
But it is only a matter of
Come and fuck me
And it is not a matter of
If you love it
But it is only a matter of
My fix

It gets all in the way, the pit in my throat
This isn't the adulthood I thought I wrote
And I never see your face, but I just might be okay with that
I have no eyes, I have no love, I have no hope

And it is not a matter of
If you mean it
But it is only a matter of
Come and fuck me
And it is not a matter of
If you love me
But it is only a matter of
My fix

And it is not a matter of
If you mean it
But it is only a matter of
Come and fuck me
And it is not a matter of
If you love me
But it is only a matter of
My fix

And it is not a matter of
If you need it
But it is only a matter of
Come and fuck me
And it is not a matter of
If you love me
But it is only a matter of
My fix2Embed
