Phaedra Lyrics
Phaedra shot it into the back of the newborn, and
Phaedra let it fall to the Earth like the billions
Phaedra, this apathy

Phaedra slipped into the gruel of the avians
Phaedra let it all come to pass
Phaedra let it all come to pass
The thought of mortality dormant in me, oh

Phaedra slipped into the gruel of the avians
Thought of mortality dormant in me, oh
Phaedra let it all come to pass
Phaedra let it all come to pass

I let it mean a lot less, and I
I let my vision vignette, and I
Old handsome death, his quiet house
Where there's nothing left to see
No God, no dawn, no need
The thought of mortality dormant in me, oh

Phaedra, it is you that I owe all my lackluster
The thought of dying is dormant in me, oh
Phaedra, it is you that made me
Phaedra, it is you that made me want to kill myself
Phaedra, it is you that I owe all my lackluster
Phaedra, this apathy
Phaedra slipped into the gruel of the avians
Phaedra let it fall to the Earth like the billions
Phaedra let it all come to pass

The thought of mortality dormant in me, oh
Phaedra, it is you that made me
Phaedra, it is you that made me want to kill myself
Phaedra, it is you that I owe all my lackluster
Phaedra, this apathy

Phaedra slipped into the gruel of the avians
Phaedra let it fall to the Earth like the billions
Phaedra let it all come to6Embed
