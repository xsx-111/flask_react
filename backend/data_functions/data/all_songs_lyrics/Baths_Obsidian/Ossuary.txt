Ossuary Lyrics
With all my desperate symmetry
With all my white lights, and straight lines
My skin will still sag
At the end of my life
Death pirouettes through the flicker of the wick
And makes you sick

Once interred, in turn to turn to bone
Ribs like a house to the lord
Once interred, in turn to turn to bone
Bugs come to worship in hordes

Once interred, in turn to turn to bone
Fate unseen, kiss the stone
You hope that where you are
That you're not alone

Then I awoke
To coil and shiver, like eel out of river
Like the grave was my own
Oh frailty
What worse fates could you possibly show me
Once interred, in turn to turn to bone
Ribs like a house to the lord
Once interred, in turn to turn to bone
Bugs come to worship in hordes

Oh, frailty
What worse fates could you possibly show me
What worse fates could you possibly show me1Embed
