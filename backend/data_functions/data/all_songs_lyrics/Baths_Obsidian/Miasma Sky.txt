Miasma Sky Lyrics
Tall rock shelf, are you maybe here to help me hurt myself?
Miasma sky, would you swallow me alive?
Tall rock shelf, are you maybe here to help me hurt myself?
Miasma sky, would you swallow me alive?


Tall rock shelf, are you maybe here to help me hurt myself?
Miasma sky, would you swallow me alive?
(Otherwise, there is very little you can do for me)
Tall rock shelf, are you maybe here to help me hurt myself?
Miasma sky, would you swallow me alive?
Tall rock shelf, are you maybe here to help me hurt myself?
(Otherwise, there is very little you can do for me)
Miasma sky, would you swallow me alive?7Embed
