No Past Lives Lyrics
Oh, I love you
And I pray you found your rays

It was my parting lie and I'd wrapped it in all the bows
It was my parting lie and I'd wrapped it in all the bows

Heaven is still on the way
Baby be a little less afraid
Your shaking keeping me awake

Heaven is still on the way
Baby be a little less afraid
I pray you found your rays
Because heaven is a ways away

Oh, I love you
And I pray you found your rays

It was my parting lie and I'd wrapped it in all the bows
It was my parting lie and I'd wrapped it in all the bows
It was my parting lie, and I'd wrapped it in all the bows
Lodged in the rectal wall of agony, hell is our only home
That was my parting lie, and I'd wrapped it in all the bows
Lodged in the rectal wall of agony, hell is our only home1Embed
