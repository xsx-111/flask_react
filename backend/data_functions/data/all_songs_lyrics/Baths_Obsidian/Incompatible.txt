Incompatible Lyrics
First boyfriend
You live in my house and we share a toilet seat
And I am not the least bit drawn
The covers in divisive heaps
Scared of how little I care

First boyfriend
You live in my house and we share a toilet seat
And I am not the least bit drawn
And I am not the least bit drawn to your heat

On the nights you roll over and introduce yourself
Nurse this erection back to full health
On the nights you roll over and introduce yourself
I am elsewhere

Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Fated all the while
You know that this was never your home
Your life, your husband, your time
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Fated all the while
You know no love remains
No, not at all, no
No, not in either one of us
You don't do anything with your life
Fascinating, terrible, your stupid idling mind
I can prod your hurt all night
Or resign and find
Any other stupid thing to do with my time
I was never poetic and never kind

Scared of how little I care for you
Scared of how little I care for you
Scared of how little I care for you
I am elsewhere

On the nights you roll over and introduce yourself
Nurse this erection back to full health
On the nights you roll over and introduce yourself
I am elsewhere

Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Fated all the while
You know that this was never your home
Your life, your husband, your time
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Fated all the while
You know no love remains
No, not at all, no
No, not in either one of us1Embed
