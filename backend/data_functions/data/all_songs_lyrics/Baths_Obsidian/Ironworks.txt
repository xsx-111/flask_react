Ironworks Lyrics
I am a sweet swine
In Victorian doorways
In tempestuous foreplay
I am a sweet swine
Among whites not bright
And clocks locked

I am a sweet swine
In Victorian doorways
In tempestuous foreplay
I am a sweet swine
Among whites not bright
And clocks locked

On the night of cake and kin
Where I took you by your skin indoors
A light spinning, we perform
(And outside, left you again to your wife)
Through Victorian doorways

How I house my heart in ironworks, it hurts
(There must be some finesse, there must be some finesse to self-worth)
How I house my heart in ironworks, it hurts
(There must be some finesse to self-worth)
I am a sweet swine
In Victorian doorways
In tempestuous foreplay
I am a sweet swine
Among whites not bright
And clocks locked

I am a sweet swine
And no man is ever mine
And no man is ever mine
I am a sweet swine
And no man is ever mine
And no man is ever mine1Embed
