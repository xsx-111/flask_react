The Gymnast, High Above the Ground LyricsThe gymnast, high above the ground
Limbers up and falls timber down
Ankles splayed and all tied
The gymnast long has arrived
Lazy, your long sister lays
Waiting out this long light brigade
Prayed for snow a long time
And lazy, it long has arrived
Through the tarlatan holes
You've been slipping, been slipping away
And the weather will hold
It's been ever so, ever so gray
But here as we're coming down
And we're sounding out:
It's a terrible, terrible tide
As it lights upon your eye
But there on the motorway
Reeks of marmalade
It's a chemical, chemical kind
As it lights upon your eye
Lights upon your eye
The bosun calls upon the quay
Compass gone, he long has lost his way
To lighthouse shine, to calm tide
The bosun long has arrived
Through the tarlatan holes
You've been slipping, been slipping away
And the weather will hold
It's been ever so, ever so gray
But here as we're coming down
And we're sounding out:
It's a terrible, terrible tide
As it lights upon your eye
But there on the motorway
Reeks of marmalade
It's a chemical, chemical kind
As it lights upon your eye
Lights upon your eye
April marches on
April marches on
April marches on
April marches onEmbed
