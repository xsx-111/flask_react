As I Rise LyricsI have come a few miles
I got blisters on my slippered feet
As I rise, as I ri-ise

But I think I might stay in the shade
For a while, for a whi-ile
Ladybird, ladybird
You're the prettiest song I heard
In a while, in a whi-ile
La di dah, la dah, la di dah dah dah la dah, la la la, la dah dah-ahEmbed
