These Eyes Lyrics

These eyes
Cry every night
For you
These arms
Long to hold you
Again

The hurtin's on me, yeah
And I will never be free
No, my baby, no no
You gave the promise to me, yeah
And you broke it
And you broke it, oh no

These eyes
Watched you bring my world
To an end
This heart
Could not accept
And pretend
The hurtin's on me, yeah
And I will never be free, no, no, no
You took the vow with me, yeah
When you spoke it
When you spoke it, babe, ah

These eyes
Are cryin'
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one
Like I had with you

These eyes
Are cryin'
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one
Like I had with you

These eyes
Are cryin'
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one
Like I had with you
These eyes
Cry every night
For you
These arms
These arms long to hold you
Hold you again, ah

These eyes
Are cryin'
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one
Like I had with you

These eyes
Are cryin'
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one
Like I had with you

These eyes
Are cryin'
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they never gonna see another one
Like I had with you
These eyes
Are cryin'
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they never gonna see another one
Like I had with you

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't ya know these eyes are cryin' every night
I need you back in my heart3Embed
