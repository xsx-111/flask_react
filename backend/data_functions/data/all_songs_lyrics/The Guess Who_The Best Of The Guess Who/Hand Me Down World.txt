Hand Me Down World Lyrics
Anybody here see the noise
See the fear and commotion?
I think we missed it
Anybody here see the love
See the hate being motioned?

Don't give me no hand me down shoes
Don't give me no hand me down love
Don't give me no hand me down world
I got one already

Anybody here see the long distance cheer for the notion?
I think we missed it
Anybody here see the sky weeping tears for the ocean?


Anybody here see the fuzzy-wuzzy loving cup explosion?
I think we missed it
Anybody here see the changing of the year-end emotion?

(Don't give me no hand me down world)
I don't really need it and I'm not going to take it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
Don't give it to me because I really don't want it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
I don't want to take it and I really don't need it, now
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
I don't want to take it and I really don't need it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
Don't want to take it, don't want to take it because I don't want to need it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
You know I don't want it, know I don't need it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
You know I don't want it, know I don't need it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
You know I don't want it and I'm not going to take it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
Don't want to take it because I don't really need it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
Just don't give it to me, don't want to take itEmbed
