Broken LyricsTake the spell away and turn me back into a man
And give me credit, you know I'm doing all I can
Grab onto something that you think you can hold
Grab onto something 'cause you're growing old

Yes, I've been broken too
Yes, I've been broken too
Just like you
So bring your soul to me and leave it here for just a while
Show the end to me and see if I can fake a smile
Grab onto something that you think you can hold
Grab onto something 'cause you're growing old

Yes, I've been broken too
Yes, I've been broken too
Just like you
I don't have to fear, nobody else is here
Don't have to see, I know what I wanna be
Don't have to make an explanation to you
It's true, the deeper the drilling goes
Shows how much the best of the better knows
That's why the bird with the broken wing never flew
And I've been broken too
Just like you
Grab onto something that you think you can hold
Grab onto something 'cause you're growing old

Yes, I've been broken too
Yes, I've been broken too
Just like you
So bring your soul to me1Embed
