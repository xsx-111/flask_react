Hang On to Your Life Lyrics
Thinking about the people gone by
Screaming that I don't want to die
Well, you can push your head
But don't you push it too far

Thinking about it's here and it's real
Wondering how I really should feel
Well, you can sell your soul
But don't you sell it too cheap

Hang on to your life, life, life
Hang on to your life

Thinking about betraying a friend
We're thinking about delaying the end
Well you can ride the wind
But don't you ride it too high


They gaped upon me with their mouths
As a ravening and a roaring lion
I am poured out like water
And all my bones are out of joint
My heart is like wax
It is melted in the midst of my bowels
My strength is dried up like a potsherd
And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws
And thou hast brought me into the dust of deathEmbed
