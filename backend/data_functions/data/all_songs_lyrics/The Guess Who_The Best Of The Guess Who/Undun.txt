Undun Lyrics
She's come undone
She didn't know what she was headed for
And when I found what she was headed for
It was too late
She's come undone
She found a mountain that was far too high
And when she found out she couldn't fly
It was too late

It's too late
She's gone too far
She's lost the sun

She's come undone
She wanted truth, but all she got was lies
Came the time to realize
And it was too late
She's come undone
She didn't know what she was headed for
And when I found what she was headed for
Mama, it was too late
It's too late
She's gone too far
She's lost the sun
She's come undone
No-na-na, no-na-na, no-na-na

Too many mountains and not enough stairs to climb
Too many churches and not enough truth
Too many people and not enough eyes to see
Too many lives to lead and not enough time

It's too late
She's gone too far
She's lost the sun
She's come undone

Doe-doe-doe-doe-doe, doe, un-doe-doe-doe, un-doe-doe-doe
Doe doe-doe-doe-doe, un-doe-doe-doe, doe-doe-doe
Doe doe-doe-doe, doe, doe-doe-doe, doe, doe

It's too late
She's gone too far
She's lost the sun

She's come undone
She didn't know what she was headed for
And when I found what she was headed for
It was too late
She's come undone
She found a mountain that was far too high
And when she found out she couldn't fly
Mama, it was too late

It's too late
She's gone too far
She's lost the sun
She's come undone

No, no-no-no-no-no, no
Doe, doe, doe-doe
