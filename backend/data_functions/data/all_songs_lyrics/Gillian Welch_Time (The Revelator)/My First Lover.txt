My First Lover Lyrics
My first lover
My first lover

He was tall and breezy with his long hair down
But he gets a little hazy when I think of him now

My first lover
My first lover

He was always talking tryin' to bring me down
But I was not waiting for a white wedding gown

From my first lover

I do not remember any going wrong
Just a record playin' that old Steve Miller song

Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl
At a surfer party with the whiskey pourin'
And the bottle rollin' I was on the floor

With my first lover
My first lover

I do not remember any fights or fits
Just shaky morning after callin' it quits

With my first lover
Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl
And she's free1Embed
