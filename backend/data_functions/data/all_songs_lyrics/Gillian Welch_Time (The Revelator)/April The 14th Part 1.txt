April The 14th Part 1 Lyrics
When the iceberg hit
Oh, they must have known
That God moves on the water
Like Casey Jones
So I walked downtown
On my telephone
Took a lazy turn
Through the red eye zone

It was a five-band bill
A two dollar show
I saw the van out in front
From Idaho
And the girl passed out
In the backseat trash
And there was no way they'd make
Even a half a tank of gas

They looked sick and stoned
And strangely dressed
No one showed
From the local press
But I watched 'em walk
Through the bottom land
And I wished I played
In a rock 'n' roll band

Hey, hey
It was the fourteenth day, of April

Then they closed it down
With the sails and rags
And they swept up the fags
And the local rags
And threw the plastic cups
Into plastic bags
And the cooks cleaned the kitchen
With the staggers and the jags

Ruination Day
And the sky was red
I went back to work
And back to bed
And the iceberg broke
And the Okies fled
And the Great Emancipator
Took a bullet in the back of the head
