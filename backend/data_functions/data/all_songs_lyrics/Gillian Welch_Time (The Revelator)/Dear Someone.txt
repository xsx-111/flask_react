Dear Someone Lyrics
I want to go all over the world
And start living free
I know that there's
Somebody who is waiting for me
I'll build a boat, steady and true
As soon as it's done
I'm going to sail along in the dreams
Of my dear someone

One little star, smiling tonight
Knows where you are
Stay, little star, steady and bright
To guide me afar
Rush, little wind, over the deep
For now I've begun
Hurry and take me straight into the arms
Of my dear someone

Hurry and take me into the arms
Of my dear someoneEmbed
