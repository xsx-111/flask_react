Everything Is Free Lyrics
Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gonna give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

I can get a tip jar
Gas up the car
And try to make a little change
Down at the bar
Or I can get a straight job
I done it before
Never minded working hard
It's who I'm working for

And everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gotta give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

Every day I wake up
Hummin' a song
But I don't need to run around
I'll just stay at home
And sing a little love song
My love and myself
If there's something that you wanna hear
You can sing it yourself

'Cause everything is free now
That's what I said
No one's gotta listen to
The words in my head
Someone hit the big score
And I figured it out
And I'm gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't payEmbed
