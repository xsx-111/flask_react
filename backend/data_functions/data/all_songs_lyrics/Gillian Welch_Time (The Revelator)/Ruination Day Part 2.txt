Ruination Day Part 2 Lyrics
And the great boat sank
And the Okies fled
And the Great Emancipator took a bullet in the head
In the head...
Took a bullet in the back of the head

It was not December
And it was not in May
It was the fourteenth of April, that is ruination day
That's the day...
The day that is ruination day

They were one, they were two
They were three, they were four
They were five hundred miles from their home
From their home...
They were five hundred miles from their home

When the iceberg hit
Then they must have known
That God moves on the water Casey Jones
Casey Jones...
God moves on the water Casey Jones
It was not December
And it was not May
It was the fourteenth of April, that is ruination day
That's the day...
The day that is ruination day1Embed
