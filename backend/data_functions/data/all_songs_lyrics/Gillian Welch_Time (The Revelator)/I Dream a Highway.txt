I Dream a Highway Lyrics
Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come and rest my soul
I dream a highway back to you

John, he's kicking out the footlights
The Grand Ole Opry's got a brand new band
Lord, let me die with a hammer in my hand
I dream a highway back to you

I think I'll move down into Memphis
And thank the hatchet man who forked my tongue
I lie and wait until the wagons come
And dream a highway back to you

The getaway kicking up cinders
An empty wagon full of rattling bones
Moon in the mirror on a three-hour jones
I dream a highway back to you

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come arrest my soul
N'I dream a highway back to you
Which lover are you, Jack of Diamonds?
Now you be Emmylou and I'll be Gram
I send a letter, don't know who I am
I dream a highway back to you

I'm an indisguisable shade of twilight
Any second now I'm gonna turn myself on
In the blue display of the cool cathode ray
I dream a highway back to you

I wish you knew me, Jack of Diamonds
Fire-riding, wheeling when I laid 'em up
Drank whisky with my water, sugar with my tea
My sails in rags with the staggers and the jags
I dream a highway back to you

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come molest my soul
N'I dream a highway back to you

Now give me some of what you're having
I'll take you as a viper into my head
A knife into my bed, arsenic when I'm fed
N'I dream a highway back to you
Hang overhead from all directions
Radiation from the porcelain light
Blind and blistered by the morning white
I dream a highway back to you

Sunday morning at the diner
Hollywood trembles on the verge of tears
I watched the waitress for a thousand years
Saw a wheel inside a wheel, heard a call within a call
N'I dreamed a highway back to you

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision convalesced my soul
N'I dream a highway back to you

Step into the light, poor Lazarus
Don't lie alone behind the window shade
Let me see the mark death made
And I dream a highway back to you
I dream a highway back to you
What will sustain us through the winter?
Where did last years lessons go?
Walk me out into the rain and snow
I dream a highway back to you

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come and bless my soul
N'I dream a highway back to you
I dream a highway back to you

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come and bless my soul
I dream a highway back to youEmbed
