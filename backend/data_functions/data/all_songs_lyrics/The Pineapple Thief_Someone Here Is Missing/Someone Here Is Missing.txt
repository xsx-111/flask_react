Someone Here Is Missing LyricsI should have strove
I should have fought
I should have shown a little love
A little love
You're in my heart
You're in my heart
But that's the easy way out
And oh
Is no one listening?
And yeah
There's someone missing
And oh
Is no one listening?
And yeah
There's someone missing
And oh
Is no one listening?
And yeah
There's someone missing
And oh
And someone here is missingEmbed
