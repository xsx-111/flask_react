Barely Breathing LyricsAlone and still
And barely breathing
I lie awake and watch you dreaming
I hold you close as if to reason
With all the years, I wish I knew...
I never said enough to make it up to you
I barely gave enough to you to make it through
I never said enough to you my love
I lie awake
And all I see is
The day we lay
On golden beaches
The deepest eyes
They couldn't see that
The world would fade
I know I couldn't
Even say enough to make it up to you
I barely gave enough for you to make it through
I never gave enough to you my love
I never said enough to you my love
I lie awake and watch you dreaming
Alone and still
And barely breathingEmbed
