Nothing At Best LyricsYeah, it was me
I give you nothing at best to hold on to
You said you had enough?
So you said? So you said...
It's never felt so right
But I am telling you to run for your life
Just stay with me tonight?
And I will bury you
Along with our lives
Alright, it's my fault
I give you nothing at best to hold on to
You said you had enough?
So you said? So you said...
Yeah, it was me
And I've got to carry this for as long as you let meEmbed
