3000 Days LyricsI've been running around in circles
Running into the ground
3000 days remind me
We've barely made a sound
I just wanted to make you happy
To light up your tired eyes
3000 days remind me
We've barely found the time to
Waste our precious lives
You know I would make you wait for
A one in a million chance?
All I can hear around me
The sound of love that passed
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
To open my wasted eyes
3000 days remind me
We've barely found the time to
Waste our precious livesEmbed
