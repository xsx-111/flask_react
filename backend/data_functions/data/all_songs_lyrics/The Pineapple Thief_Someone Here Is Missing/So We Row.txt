So We Row LyricsI want say how much I need
Just a break
A little break
I want to say how much I need
Just a taste
A little taste
I want to go away and try
Just to waste
A little time
I want to go away and find
A place
For you and I
SO WE ROW
I'll stop the sun from beating you
To the ground
To the ground
I'll find a land where no one makes
A sound
Not a single sound
SO WE ROW
I've found a place where no one makes a soundEmbed
