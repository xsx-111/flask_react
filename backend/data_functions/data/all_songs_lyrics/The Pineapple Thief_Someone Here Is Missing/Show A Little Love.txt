Show A Little Love LyricsWhat was it you said?
I've got to hold someone?
Or even show a little love?
It's plain to see
The walls are closing in for you and me
I cannot help it if I'm taking the wrong way?
I'm taking the wrong way down
Remember what I said?
I've got to lean on someone
So show a little love
And you know what I meant?
You've got to show a little love before…
It's plain to see
The walls are closing in for you and me
I cannot help it if I'm taking the wrong way?
I'm taking the wrong way down
You've got to bring me round
You've got to beat some sense back
To show a little love
So bring yourself around
And take another shot
When I'm down...
It's plain to see
The walls are closing in for you and me
I cannot help it if I'm taking the wrong way…
We're taking the wrong way down…Embed
