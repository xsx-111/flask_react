Preparation For Meltdown LyricsI want to say no more
Stop messing with my head
Stop messing with my head
And through the open door
They're swarming around my head
They're swarming around my head
I want to say no more
What's stopping me? You said
And picking at my skin
And burrowing within
They're burrowing within
And throttling my soul
They will not let me go
They will not let me go
And through the open door
Come swarm around my head
Come swarm around my head...
Look into my eyes
I want to say I will
I want to say I will
I look into your eyes
Oh so very still
Oh so very still
I want to say no more
You know I always will
You know I always willEmbed
