Wake Up The Dead LyricsIt's not the same
It's not the same any more
You protected me
I wouldn't ask for more
A 1000 miles
Of crawling to your door
I'm gonna find out what's in your head
And yeah, I'm gonna find out what's in your head
We're not the same
We're not the same anymore
Your suicide
Has washed up at my door
I'm gonna find out what's in your head
And yeah, I'm gonna find out what's in your head
We're not the same anymore
And yeah, I'm gonna scratch out what's in your head
And yeah, I'm gonna find a way to wake up the deadEmbed
