Animals in Garden LyricsThe business at hand
No not the dying race
But where we park our cars and eat
Makes up an ocean for those that sail for blood and divide the loot amongst the awake
How on earth can we believe we're in charge here?
Throw all of our weight all you want
We are just animals in garden
The latest ration -
A roar to raise the wall
You hear all the sounds bouncing around here?
It keeps us all forever tired, recycling rolls
Your eyes that bound the way it is are only watchingEmbed
