Tube Orms LyricsCan we find our seats?
Will you calmly listen?
Have we run our minds to mush?
Behave
Where are the eyes for the road while we
Are sleeping?
Unless the system fails
We're sure not to forget it
But while we rush to document
It's gone
As long as something is pulsing while we
Are dreaming
All I ever wanted was to be there
And be there without
The pictures came back too dark
A blurry shaped pixel mess
The original, it had more blue
Or at least I thought
It's hard to say
By the time we had gotten back
To the shore
The sea had drained
Now it's gone
There is only salt
We were just too late
We were much too late
We were much too late
All I ever wanted was to be thereEmbed
