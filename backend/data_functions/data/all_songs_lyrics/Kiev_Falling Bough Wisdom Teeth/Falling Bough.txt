Falling Bough Lyrics
We try and listen close
But where we live is far too high to hear
Why don't we come down from this
And leave the fiction to the fool that fears

Little tired
(We are) All a little tired, oh
(We are) All a little tired
(We are) All a little tired, oh
(We are)

We're trying to hear a ghost
But just below the bough is ancient soil
Breathing out complex compost
But from above it will always seem like dirt
A little tired
It's about that time

All a little tired
(We are) All a little tired, oh
(We are) All a little tired
(We are) All a little tired, oh
(We are) All a little tired
(We are) All a little tired, oh
(We are)
Some would have it known this is how it is
And how it's been
Or is it because they can't convince themselves
To put away the book and pull themselves to Earth with all?

(We are) All a little tired
(We are) All a little tired, oh
(We are) All a little tired
(We are) All a little tired, oh
(We are) All a little tired
(We are) All a little tired, oh
(We are)
(We are) All a little tired, oh
(We are)Embed
