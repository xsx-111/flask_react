Be Gone Dull Cage Lyrics
The sun has finally come
Time to toss the flowers the patients saved
A key lime pie
Pulled apart for five to wash the last surprise
A dizzy rationale
The door will burst
The room will flood with light
You were born a little low

Never mind the other
Never mind the other
Never mind the other
Never mind the other

We've spent so long
Growing further from
The place we've come
And love to fear the most
The floor, the floor, the floor...
You change your mind
Now we nurse
The way we feed like babies on plastic bags
Tried to chase the light
It's time to ride the tide that leads back home
It's not hard to let go
Never mind the other
Never mind the other
Never mind the other
Never mind the other

Wind is blowing
Slowly growing
Can you help us build a house?
Wind is blowing
Slowly growing
Can you help us build a house?

Never mind the other
Never mind the other
Never mind the other
Never mind the other, oh

You're about to find out
Don't change your mind, the other
Never mind the other (You're about to find out)
Don't change your mind, the other
You're about to find out
Don't change your mind, the other
Never mind the other (You're about to find out)
Don't change your mind, the other
You're about to find out
Don't change your mind, the other
Never mind the other (You're about to find out)
Don't change your mind, the other
Never mind the other (You're about to find out)
Don't change your mind, the other
Never mind the other (You're about to find out)
Don't change your mind, the other
Never mind the other (You're about to find out)
Don't change your mind, the other
You're about to find out
Don't change your mind, the other
Never mind the other (You're about to find out)Embed
