Drag Bones LyricsDrag on out your bones
From the yard
Out in the dark
As soon as all this rain is in
They're gonna show
Right through the soil
The river'll rise
She always has
It was us that buried them
In her side
Come rise up
It's coming down
Surely we will try to swim
And keep our heads above
The crushing mess
So we can see ourselves
Delivered from
The rush of flooded fate that she's
Always warned
Distant light
Surround us all
We won't ask why
As long as we wait for it
It will show
It will show
It will rise
It will rise
It will grow
It will grow
Come rise up
It's coming downEmbed
