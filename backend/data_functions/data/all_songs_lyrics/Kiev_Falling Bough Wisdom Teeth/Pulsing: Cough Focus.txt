Pulsing: Cough Focus LyricsDo you want to walk beside me for a while?
For a while
Do you want to walk beside me through a fire?
Through the wild
Can you tell me why we're pushing if it's not for love?
If not for love
Can you tell me why we rush this?
It's not for love
And do you know why so many choose not to look when there's so much?
There's so much
Do you want to walk beside me?
But just for loveEmbed
