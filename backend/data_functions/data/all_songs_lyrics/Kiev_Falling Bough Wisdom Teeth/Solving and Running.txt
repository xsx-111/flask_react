Solving and Running LyricsStill hiding with a blood soaked T-shirt
No way to know what we're hiding from
A beam of light and voice that promises and says
"You can keep your wisdom teeth...
As long as they're straight"
All we know is what we're told
"There will never be a reason for these bones"
It's still pulsing
All we are
Is what we've found
Will we ever need the pieces that we lost?
It's still pulsing
Not sure we really understand
Agree to solve or run, solve or run
Not sure we really know what we had
Coming in
The passing ritual repeats
Remove the few to clear the aisle
Because if left alone they'll just keep growing and pulsing
So what to do with wisdom teeth?
All we know is what we're told
"There will never be a reason for these bones"
It's still pulsing
All be drawn
The tangled dance
Will we ever need the pieces that we lost?
It's still pulsing
Not sure we really understand
Agree to solve or run, solve or run
Not sure we really know what we had
Coming inEmbed
