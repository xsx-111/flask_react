Pulsing: Home Now LyricsCan't keep looking for windows out
That distant garden can draw the eye
Best we keep light on through the night
Allow it all to show
We're home now
Home for good
Don't borrow more than we can afford to
We're home now
Home for good
Let's put away the thoughts that destroy us all
Can't keep waiting on promises
It'll keep you tied to a dusty throne
We grew up here to thrive and love
Not to serve
We're home now
Home for good
Don't borrow more than we can afford to
We're home now
Home for good
Let's put away the thoughts that destroy usEmbed
