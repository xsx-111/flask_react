Pulsing: Tired Lungs LyricsTired lungs
Grasp for rope
All follow where they're led
Follow where they're dragged
Still some hope
For storms to break it down
Wash it off to sea
Just wash it all
The oldest curse
A sick horse wandering towards
Where their fathers heard
Follow fathers words
There's some that hope
And will kill for mom
And never wonder why we can't
Ever stop the wheel
Wash this allEmbed
