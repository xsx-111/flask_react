Trees are Trees Lyrics
Soon we'll find a time to listen
Have we shattered our design enough?
From that shattered knowledge grows resistance

Come down and realize we're always drawn by the brightest show beyond us
Come down
We didn't mind at all did we
Come down
Leave that all behind

Attrition led us quietly
Dismiss all we get
The veil I thought we saw dissolved from eyes
But the soil I sat alone in was slowly known
Sunlight found

Come down and realize we're always drawn by the brightest show beyond us
Come down
We didn't mind at all did we
Come down
Leave that all behind
Come down and realize we're always drawn by the brightest show beyond us
Come down
We didn't mind at all did we
Come down
Leave that all behindEmbed
