Ariah Being LyricsThis place you'd never know unless you see the systems
Inside the walls a tangled pulse is bleeding through
And the kids feel right at home
Ghosts from the bottom floor echoes past the kitchen
Where they cage and cut it up to serve the sovereign few
Can they hear the cold waves of repercussions?
Will it come in time?
Just out the swinging door - a slow pull dilation
A flood of light and spotted noise surround the youth
When the patterns dissolve to earth there will be warmth
Just out the broken gate are angry seas of reason
Will it rise? Can she rise to build and break?
If all of us are asleep at work who will warn? Who will warn?
Here she comes
Wind is blowing
Slowly growing
Can you show us how to build a house?
Brothers sleeping
Sisters sleeping
Can you show us how to build a house?
Fathers working
Mothers working
Can you show us how to build a house?
Wind is blowing
It's still growing
Can you show us? Show us?
Will it come in time?1Embed
