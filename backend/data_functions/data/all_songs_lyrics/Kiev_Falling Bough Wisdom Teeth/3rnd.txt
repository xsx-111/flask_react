3rnd Lyrics
This here formality
When we come crawling back
It's just talkback, talkback
Who'd ever listen
To round and around 
Without talkback, they'll talk back
Tryin' to find the place
Where people sit far away from me when we talk back
Yeah there's talkback
All around

Turn into your path, I  less if they want more, oh oh
Turn, I can't tell if anybody's listening at the door, oh oh

They say we compromise
The things we love, love, love just to push it out
 talkback, turns to bird song
This is the cry of a raging architect
He sees the shapes with the paintbrush
Not as the dull cage
Tryin' to find the place
Where people sit far away from me when they talk back
Yeah there's talkback
I was standin' around in the parking lot and I
Just starting talking loud and there's talkback
Yeah there's talkback, 
Turn into your path, I  less if I want more, oh oh
Turn, I can't tell if anybody's listening at the door, oh oh
If I

Learn your path
Learn your path
And turn into the last one 
There's talkback
Talkback
Talkback, c'mon
Learn your path
Learn you path and turn into love
Turn your side
Turn your side and turn into the last one 

Turn into your path, I  less if they want more, oh oh
Turn, I can't tell if anybody's listening at the door, oh oh
Turn, I  less if they want more, oh oh
Turn, I can't tell. Is anybody listening at the door? Oh oh
Turn, oh, turnEmbed
