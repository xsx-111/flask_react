Everybody Loves You Lyrics
I am so tired, I
Have to tame my mind
Before I get too frustrated
Can't go back in time
To change in someone's eyes
No, I was not something to play with

Try not to talk about it
I'm too mad, I'm too late, I'm too gentle
It's too hard to explain, I'm not helpful
No

It's my body and I'm trying to
Hate you 'cause I want to
It's my body and I'm trying to
While everybody loves you
It's my body and I'm trying to
Forgive you, I don't want to
It's my body and it hates you
Why does everybody love you?

Sometimes, I close my eyes
Amidst the dancing lights
When it feels too wild for breathing
I can't sleep at night
Unless I start to lie
And believe it like a story, no, no
Try not to think about it
So insane, I'm so used to my nightmares
It's okay 'til it's not and I'm back there
No, no

It's my body and I'm trying to
Hate you 'cause I want to
It's my body and I'm trying to
While everybody loves you
It's my body and I'm trying to
Forgive you, I don't want to
It's my body and it hates you
Why does everybody love you?

Why does everybody love you?
They don't know enough about you
Why does everybody love you?
They don't know the things that I do
Why does everybody love you?
They don't know enough about you
Do they know that I regret you?
Do they know I shouldn't have to?Embed
