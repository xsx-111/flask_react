Sleep at Night Lyrics
Not that you asked
But I'm getting past everything, everything
I'm doing okay
Just glad it's not yesterday, huh

My husband's girlfriend's husband just called me up
How messed up is that?
It's so insane that I have to laugh
But then I think about our two boys trying to become men
There's nothing funny about that

How do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you tell those lies? (Oh)
Lookin' me in the eye (Oh)
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you sleep at night?

You're only as sick as your secrets
So I'm telling everything
Half of the shit you won't believe
But I know it's not unique to me
Remember you brought her to our show at the Hollywood Bowl
She said, "I love you, I'm such a fan"
I joked that you can love me as long as you don't love my man
There's nothin' funny about that

How do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you tell those lies? (Oh)
Lookin' me in the eye (Oh)
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you sleep at night?

So caught up in your story
You don't care what you're ruining
So caught up in your story
But you don't care

How do you sleep at night?
How do you tell those lies?
Lookin' me in the eye
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night?
How do you sleep at night?
Oh (Oh)
How do you tell those lies? (Oh)
How do you tell those lies?
Lookin' me in the eye (Oh)
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you sleep at night? (Oh)1Embed
