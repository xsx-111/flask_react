Texas Man Lyrics
I could use a Texas man
But one who can feel at home
Yeah, here in the California sand
Who holds me like he'll never let go
It's been way too long
Since somebody's body was tangled with mine
Yeah, tangled up with mine

Everybody wants top market
But I'm a little bit unraveled
Everybody wants the new model
But I'm a little bit more traveled
If you got the strength I do
Then sign me up
If I'm not too much for you
Then sign me up, sign me up
I'm a little bit unraveled
But I'm ready
Uh-huh, huh, uh-huh, huh
And I'm ready
Uh-huh, uh-huh, huh

Yeah, I could use a Texas man
Who's not afraid to take his time
He's gotta have patient hands
'Cause the way to my heart is through my mind
Been way too long
Since somebody's body kept me up all night
Yeah, that good kinda keepin' me up all night
Everybody wants top market
But I'm a little bit unraveled
Everybody wants the new model
But I'm a little bit more traveled
If you got the strength I do
Then sign me up
If I'm not too much for you
Then sign me up, sign me up
I'm a little bit unraveled
But I'm ready
Uh-huh, huh, uh-huh, huh
And I'm ready
Uh-huh, uh-huh, huh

Feelin' my way in the dark
Steal a kiss in your car
Feelin' your way in the dark
Steal another one at the door

Everybody wants top market
But I'm a little bit unraveled
Everybody wants the new model
But I'm a little bit more traveled
If you got the strength I do
Then sign me up
If I'm not too much for you
Then sign me up
Yeah, sign me up
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Feelin' my way in the dark
Steal a kiss in your car
Feelin' your way in the dark
Steal another one at the door
Fallin' asleep in your arms
Under the West Coast stars
Uh-huh, huh, uh-huh, huh, uh-huh, huh
And I'm ready
Uh-huh, huh, uh-huh, huh
And I'm ready
Uh-huh, huh, uh-huh, huh
And I'm readyEmbed
