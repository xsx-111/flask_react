Young Man Lyrics
I had no words for you that Saturday
As we both watched our entire worlds change
Your hero fell just as you came of age
And I had no words, but now I know what to say

You're of me, not mine
Walk your own crooked line
I promise you'll be fine
Take the best parts of him
As your own life begins
Leave the bad news behind you

Young man
Take a good look at my life and
Try to understand
I've done my best the best I know how to
And my blues aren't your blues
It's up to you

After this storm
There's nothing you can't navigate
Point to the truth
You'll see it's the only way
You're of me, not mine
Perfect in my eyes
You're gonna be alright
Take the best parts of him
As your own life begins
Leave the bad news behind

Young man
Take a good look at my life and
Try to understand
I've done my best the best I know how to
And my blues aren't your blues
It's up to you
It's up to you

Young man
Take a good look at my life and
Try to understand
I've done my best the best I know how to
And my blues aren't your blues
You'll walk in your own shoes
It's up to youEmbed
