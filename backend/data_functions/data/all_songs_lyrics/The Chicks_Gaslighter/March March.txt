March March Lyrics
March, march to my own drum
March, march to my own drum
Hey, hey, I'm an army of one
Oh, I'm an army of one
March, march to my own drum
March, march to my own drum
Hey, hey, I'm an army of one
Oh, I'm an army of one

Brenda's packin' heat 'cause she don't like Mondays
Underpaid teacher policin' the hallways
Print yourself a weapon and take it to the gun range
(Ah, cut the shit, you ain't goin' to the gun range)
Standin' with Emma and our sons and daughters
Watchin' our youth have to solve our problems
I'll follow them, so who's comin' with me?
(Half of you love me, half already hate me)

March, march to my own drum
March, march to my own drum
Hey, hey, I'm an army of one
Oh, I'm an army of one
March, march to my own drum
March, march to my own drum
Hey, hey, I'm an army of one
Oh, I'm an army of one
Tell the ol' boys in the white bread lobby
What they can and can't do with their bodies
Temperatures are risin', cities are sinkin'
(Ah, cut the shit, you know your city is sinkin')
Lies are truth and truth is fiction
Everybody's talkin', who's gonna listen?
What the hell happened in Helsinki?

March, march to my own drum
March, march to my own drum
Hey, hey, I'm an army of one
Oh, I'm an army of one
March, march to my own drum
March, march to my own drum
Hey, hey, I'm an army of one
Oh, I'm an army of one
