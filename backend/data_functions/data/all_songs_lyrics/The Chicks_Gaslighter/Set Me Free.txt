Set Me Free Lyrics
I've done what I know
To help me move on
I've been sick from the hurt
I've cried alone
Why, oh why do you keep me tethered?
You've taken enough from me
Untangle me from your lifeline
Why not just set me free?

Don't you feel you're wasting time?
You have the power to make it right

Decency
Would be for you to sign and release me
If you ever loved me
Then will you do this one last thing?
Set me free, set me free
Oh, set me free

To have and to hold
Oh, the weight of this hate was exhausting
You risked my body, broke my spirit
And still, I've let you go
Just because you've been a bad guy
I've seen it with my own eyes
There's a good guy in there

Decency
Would be for you to sign and release me
If you ever loved me
Then will you do this one last thing?
Set me free, set me free
Oh, set me free
Set me free, let me be
Oh, set me freeEmbed
