Julianna Calm Down Lyrics
Julianna, calm down
You know he's about to leave, but don't panic
Don't give him the satisfaction that you can't handle it
Breathe, it'll be okay
And Harper, hold on
To the piece you know he's gonna try to take when he's gone
And you know exactly where he'll try to take it from
Breathe, it'll be okay

Just put on, put on, put on your best shoes
And strut the fuck around like you've got nothin' to lose
Show off, show off, show off your best moves
And do it with a smile so he doesn't know it's
Put on, put on, put on
Put on, put on

Don't think about his lips
How every time he'd kiss you, you'd tremble
Try to only think about the bad things you remember
Breathe, it'll be okay
I guess this is the time to remind you
Sometimes, what's going through your head
Is just a temporary situation
And light will soon be shed, oh
Just put on, put on, put on your best shoes
And strut the fuck around like you've got nothin' to lose
Show off, show off, show off your best moves
And do it with a smile so that no one knows it's
Put on, put on, put on
Put on, put on, put on, yeah
Put on, put on, put on
Put on, put on

And Katie, calm down
You know there'll come a time you think you can't handle it
But dig deep and know that you can handle it
Breathe, it'll be okay
And Eva, hold on
To everything you know to be true
Don't let the wolves get the best of you
Breathe, you're gonna make it through

So just put on, put on, put on your best shoes
And strut the fuck around like you've got nothin' to lose
Show off, show off, show off your best moves
And do it with a smile so that no one knows it's
Put on, put on, put on
Put on, put on, put on, yeah
Put on, put on, put on, oh
Put on, put on
I guess this is the time to remind you
Sometimes, what's going through your head
Is just a temporary situation
And light will soon be shed, oh

Just put on, put on, put on, yeah
Put on, put on, put on, yeah
Put on, put on, put on, yeah
Put on, put on

And Violet, calm down
And Juno, calm down
And Yaya, calm down
And Berta, calm down
Hesper, calm down
And Amelia, calm down
Naomi, calm down
Julianna, calm down
Julianna, calm down
Julianna, calm downEmbed
