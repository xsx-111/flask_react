For Her Lyrics
I'm a lover 'cause I can't help myself
A natural mother since the day that I fell
Not a martyr, I'm just someone who cares

So dig a little bit deeper
And be a little bit kinder
And a lot less guarded
'Cause it takes, it takes
It takes a lot of hard work
To get a whole lot stronger
'Cause it's real tough, girl

Why can't we be together?
Why can't we love for her?

Wish I could go back and tell my younger self
"You're a fighter, you just don't know it yet"

So dig a little bit deeper
And be a whole lot louder
And a lot less guarded
'Cause it takes, it takes
It takes a lot of hard work
To get a whole lot stronger
'Cause it's real tough, girl
Why can't we be together?
Why can't we love for her?

Stand up, show love for her, for her
Stand up, show up for her, for her
Stand up, show love for her, for her
Stand up, show up for her, for her
Why can't we be together?
Why can't we love for her?

So dig a little bit deeper
And be a whole lot kinder
And a lot less guarded
'Cause it takes, it takes
It takes a lot of hard work
To get a whole lot stronger
'Cause it's real tough, girl

Stand up, show love
Stand up, show up
Stand up, show love for her, for her
Stand up, show love for her, for her
Stand up, show up for her, for her
Oh, stand up
Oh, stand up for her
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
Mmm
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-daEmbed
