Mutiny On The World LyricsCrazy lines, seems you're always standing in
Gets to your mind, you feel like living life in sin
I know the struggle, but there's a remedy
Revolt is your salvation just come with me
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
Mutiny, mutiny on the world alright
You say the laws are getting harder to obey
And the rules are being broken everyday
You got the picture, and now your time has come
Anarchy is open season for everyone
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
That's what we said, now we're ahead
One more word out of you Mr. leader
And you'll be eating lead
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
Mutiny, mutiny on the worldEmbed
