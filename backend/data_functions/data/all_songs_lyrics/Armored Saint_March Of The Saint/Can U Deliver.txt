Can U Deliver LyricsAlright
Can u deliver
I'm overlooking you
Laying out the question
Think that you'll pull through
Do you know what love means
A push and then a shove
Don't put the thought around me
I'm coming from above yea
Me I'm just a young soul lookin
For a good time tonight
You want it to last forever
I don't have that in sight no
Seems to be the same old story
You get 'em once and they fall at your knees
I wish that I would've known better
Before I played the dirty deed
Not romance to me
It's just the fever
Here's your chance to please
Can u deliver
Can u deliver
Can u deliver
Can u deliver
It's a shame to take your dreams
And chain them to reality
I don't listen anymore
Action is what I need
Not romance to me
It's just the fever
Here's your chance to please
Can u deliver
Can u deliver, can u deliver, can u deliver
Can u deliver, can u deliver, can u deliver
Can u deliver
Deliver to me1Embed
