Take A Turn LyricsHear her words
Whispers on the shore
Blinded by a haze, in a daze
I pick myself off the ground
Hey
I know the words I speak, could enter
Your mind when you sleep
Then the act is done
I just wait for the outcome
Take a turn with me
Can you feel the force
Wo-oh, Wo-oh
Setting the course
On and on the
Days go by
Still I hear
No reply
Then I start
To wonder if
My aim was a lie
Then she comes to me
Unspoken
Without a word, without a sign
Just let your passion flow
And let me know
What's on your mind
Take a turn with me
Can you feel the force
Wo-oh, Wo-oh
Setting the course
I didn't mean to make you uptight
Just had to make sure it felt right
Save your words, take a turn with me
Save your words, take a turn with me
With all my thirst, I didn't even get my money's worth
Turn from meEmbed
