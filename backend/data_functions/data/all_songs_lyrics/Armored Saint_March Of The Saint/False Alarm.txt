False Alarm LyricsLook out the window the sounds in the wind
You hear the siren again and again
Screaming a whine deep in your mind
Follow the sign and you'll soar
Piercing shrill that keeps you awake
You're the example he's ready to take
Though it seems wild go for the ride
A change has been made for you on the other side
Another false alarm, another false alarm
It won't do any harm, just another false alarm
Deep in a sleep you're awoken again
This time departure is scheduled at ten
Not a bad deal this on'e for real
And I can't let it go
Piercing shrill that keeps you awake
You're the example he's ready to take
Laugh when you lose hung by the noose
Anyway the fire still burns to the core
Another false alarm, another false alarm
Just another false alarm
False alarmEmbed
