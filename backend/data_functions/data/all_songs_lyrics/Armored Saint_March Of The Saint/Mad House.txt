Mad House LyricsI got an urge to tell a story
Mad house set to unload
I try my best to keep a distance
From going down loony road
But I get crushed with the temptation
For the place that makes you move-to the groove
Right down loony road
This certain pad will make your heart beat
Rum, sex, drop hit the floor
Next day you feel your head spin
Back up again, do it some more
Then I get crushed with that temptation
For the place that makes you move
And when it feels good there
You better raise your beer to the mess
The only place for you to be-mad house
Back in touch with insanity-mad house
It don't matter what you do-mad house
Just as long that it's good for you-mad house
Right down loony road
I got an urge to tell a story
Mad house set to unload
I try my best to keep a distance
From going down loony road
I just get crushed with that temptation
For the place that makes you move
And when it feels good there
Raise your beer to the mess
The only place for you to be-mad house
Back in touch with insanity-mad house
It don't matter what you do-mad house
Just as long that it's good for you-mad house
Mad house, mad house
Mad house, mad houseEmbed
