Glory Hunter LyricsCavalry leader with a bold upper hand
Boyhood dream was achieved
Praised by the soldiers down by his side
The regiment followed his lead
The antagonists were so obsessed
Glory hunter his name
Fearlessly fighting the savage man
Brought him fortune and fame
My command, my command
A voice heard throughout the land
My command, ride by the sand
A must to fulfill the plan
Inner voices scream
Glory bound, glory bound, glory bound, glory bound
Joining in to circle the reds
Affirm action awaits
Reported word a village is near
Fifteen miles away
Valley below two thousand or more
Hostile tribe in a mass
Hearing the thunder pound in his head
Move in to surmount the task
My command, my command
A voice heard throughout the land
My command, ride by the sand
A must to fulfill the plan
Inner voices scream
Glory bound, glory bound, glory bound, glory bound
Look at defeat in the face
And don't say a word
Bloody war 'til the end
Shine like a pearl
My command, my command
A voice heard throughout the land
My command, ride by the sand
A must to fulfill the plan
