Thin Line Lyrics
You never say enough
Wooohoo I said too much
Come on open up
Wooohoo I must stay shut
Well it's a thin line between lovin'
And wastin' my time
Thin line

Give in shiners
Crazy diamonds
Head out towards the sea
Nobody loves you
Except for me

Close to overflow
Woohoo our wells run low
Longing to make the cut
You can walk but oh don't touch
Cuz it's a thin line between lovin'
And wastin' my time
Thin line between lovin' and wastin' my time

Give in shiners
Crazy diamonds
Head out towards the sea
Nobody loves you
Except for me
Except for me3Embed
