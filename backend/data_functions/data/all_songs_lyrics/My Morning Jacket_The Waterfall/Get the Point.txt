Get the Point Lyrics
Well we talked and talked and carried on from
Sundown till the break of dawn
We put the needle on the line
It just kept skipping
And then I realized all the time I was wasting
Trying to mend a broken situation
Daydreaming of leaving
I only had to do it
And now it's done
You still call every day to no avail
I never have an answer
I never seem to be there for you

But there's only so many ways that one can
Look at a given situation
And I wish you all the love in this world and beyond

I hope you get the point
I hope you get the point
I hope you get the point
The thrill is gone
I hope you get the point
I think our love is done

Well I was feeling sympathetic
But still sorry for myself
Flying blind I really wasn't listening
So I'm trying to tell you plainly how I'm feeling day to day
And I'm so sorry now that you ain't feeling the same way

There is only so many ways that one can
Look at a given situation
And I wish you all the love in this world and beyond

I guess you get the point
I guess you get the point
I guess you get the point
The thrill is gone, gone, gone
I hope you get the point
I hope you get the point
I hope you get the point
The love is doneEmbed
