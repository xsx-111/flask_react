Tropics (Erase Traces) LyricsTropics
Off the map
Thru the glass ceiling
On the right path
Out of body for the first time
In a long time
The right time
Window to another world
Worked all day
Worked all nite
Gettin nowhere
Drove all day
Drove all night
Going nowhere
Out of print
Threw caution to the wind
Window to another world
Tropics
Off the map
Thru the glass ceiling
On the right path
Out of body for the first time
In a long time
The right time
Heart of progress
Strange as it seems
In suspended animation
On the same page
Tastes change
Frame by frame
Erase traces
Of the past
Do the math
Repeats itself
Best of friends
Until the end
If given the chance
The silent observer
Watching always
Watching always2Embed
