Believe (Nobody Knows) Lyrics
Time to roll, the answer floats on down the farthest shore
Of the mind
Roll the dice that sailed the ship and all the doors will open
On down the line
Tend to roam, the lesson learned and then forgotten over
In our time
In that moment, I awoke among the smoke and mirrors
I was blind

Believe, believe, believe, believe
Nobody knows
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Nobody knows for sure

It begins and on and on, the baby's born the elders down
All in their time
Start of dawn, the setting sun, the day has come, my mind is open
My oh my

Believe, believe, believe, believe
Nobody knows
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Nobody knows for sure
Time to roll, the answer floats on down the farthest shore
Of the mind
Roll the dice that sailed the ship and all the world will open
All this time

Believe, believe, believe, believe
Nobody knows
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knowsEmbed
