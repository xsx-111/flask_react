Like A River Lyrics
Breeze has blown
Leaves have fallen
Days grow short
River flowing
Bird has flown
Misty morning
Path well-worn
River flowing
Finally home
Sun is shining
Weather's sweet
River winding

Like a river flowing, like a river winding its way
Like a river flowing, like a river winding its way
Like a river flowing, like a river winding its way
Like a river flowing, like a river
(Hey-eh-oh-way-eh-oh-way-eh-oh-way-eh-oh-way-eh-oh-way-eh-oh-way)

Time has come
World in motion
Heart of man
Swept into the ocean
Like a river flowing, like a river washes away
Like a river flowing, like a river washes away
Like a river flowing, like a river winding its way
Like a river flowing, like a river
