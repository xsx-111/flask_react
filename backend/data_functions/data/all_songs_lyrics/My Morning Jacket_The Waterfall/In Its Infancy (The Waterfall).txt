In Its Infancy (The Waterfall) Lyrics
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again

The idea was always there in its infancy
The seed took root over many years
An idea crawls before it walks
And as it walks, it learns to run
And as it runs, it fears its fall
The waterfall, can it be stopped?

Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again I stop the waterfall by simply thinking
Again I stop the waterfall before my breathing
Again I stop the waterfall by finally feeling
Again I stop the waterfall by just believing
Again I stop the waterfall by simply thinking
Again I stop the waterfall before my breathing
Again I stop the waterfall by finally feeling
Again I stop the waterfall by just believing

Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again

The idea was always there in its infancy
The seed took root over many yearsEmbed
