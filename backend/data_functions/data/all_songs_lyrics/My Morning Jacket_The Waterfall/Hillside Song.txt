Hillside Song LyricsI wanna tell you I need you but that sounds so cliché
The grass is always greener on the other side anyway
Why do I value our time now that it's done
Rollin' down the hillside song
Rollin' down the hillside just playin' like two kids
In this grown up world, you're all I understood
At the top of the hillside we were standin' on
Rollin' down the hillside song
You in the moonlight and me in the dark
Night after night, we did always have that spark
What about the music we made so strong?
What about the hillside song?
Mm
When times were difficult, what was I runnin' from?
Rollin' down the hillside song
Wanna tell you I need you but that sounds so cliché
The grass is always greener on the other side anyway
Why do I value our time now that it's done
Rollin' down the hillside song
Mm
Rollin' down the hillside song
Mm
Rollin' down the hillside songEmbed
