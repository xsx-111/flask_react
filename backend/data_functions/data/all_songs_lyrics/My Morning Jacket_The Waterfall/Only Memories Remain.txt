Only Memories Remain LyricsOnly memories remain
Only memories remain
For a time there by the sea
There was only you and me
In a land that time forgot
You uttered sweet forget-me-nots
And you know, yeah, I never will
But sometimes life has other ideas
And though we both know how much it meant
Now only memories remain
Only memories remain
Only memories remain
Only memories remain, yeah yeah
Only memories remain
The names and places have all been changed
But the identity remains the same
As time and space do what they will
The spirit, so vogue, can never be killed
Our earthly bodies will surely fall
But the love we share outlives us all
What's done is done at the end of the day
But still those memories remain
Only memories remain, yeah yeah
Only memories remain
Only memories remain, yeah yeah
Only memories remain
Yeah, only remain, only remain, oh
Yeah, only remain, only remain, oh
Oh
Yeah, only remain, only remain, oh
(Only memories remain)
Yeah, only remain, only remain, oh
(Only memories remain, only memories remain)
Yeah, only remain, only remain, oh
(Only memories remain, only memories remain)4Embed
