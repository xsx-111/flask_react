Compound Fracture (Miami Jungle Version) LyricsCompound fracture, gonna ring the gong
And sound the warnin' of what's to come
If we ain't careful as to where we step
Paradise callin' or untimely death
Compound fracture, gotta set the bone
Wrap it up; let it heal on its own
Don't walk on it; give it time to rest
Can't be all action all the time
Just got to give it some time, time, oh
There's no evil; there's no good
Only people doin' as they should
There is life in love and sound
Get as much as you can keep around
'Fore they put you into the ground
For who knows how long
How long
I know you're young; that's the time to learn
If we're too soft on you, you will get burned
Fill your skull with what you want
Can't be all action all the time
Just got to give it some time, time, oh
There's no evil; there's no good
Only people doin' as they should
Or as they should in the light of day
God and the Devil were made up anyway
But their meanings so real and so plain
There is life in love and sound
Get as much as you can keep around
'Fore they put you into the ground
For who knows how long
How long (ooh)
For who knows how long
How long
'Til the next go 'round
'Til the next go 'round (AH)
Yeah, I'm still, that stuff could all be; I'm just tryin' to explore
No, don't worry about it, man *claps* (I love those jazz chords at the end; I love those jazz chords at the end)
I'm feelin' a little weird about it (hahahaha)Embed
