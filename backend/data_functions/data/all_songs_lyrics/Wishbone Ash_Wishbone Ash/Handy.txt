Handy LyricsWas sat down by my fire, hear a voice of desire
Want to be friends again
I keep tellin' you,man, she's only a pain
She don't fit in my scene
She don't fit in my world no more
And the best has to stay
Keep knockin' on my door. She's gone away
We're kickin' the thoughts around the floorEmbed
