Short and Curlies Lyrics
Too bad, she's got you by the balls
You can't get free at all
She's got your name, she's got your number
You're screaming like thunder
And you can't get away from it all

It's too bad, she's got you by the balls
You can't break loose at all
She's got your name, she's got your number
You're screaming like thunder
And you're trapped like a rat in a hole

It's too bad, she's got you by the balls
She's nailed you to the wall
Oh, it's a shame ah, but it's funny
She crashed your car, she spend your money
And you can't get away from it all

It's too bad, she's grabbed a handful
And you can't get away from it all
It's too bad, ooh, and it's painful
And you can't break away from the stall
And you can't get away from it all
It's too bad
She's got you by the balls
She's got your name, she's got your number
You're screaming' blue murder
And you can't get away from it all

It's too bad, she's got you by the balls
She's got you by the balls
She's got you by the balls
She's got you by the
It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too bad
So sad, so sad
It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too badEmbed
