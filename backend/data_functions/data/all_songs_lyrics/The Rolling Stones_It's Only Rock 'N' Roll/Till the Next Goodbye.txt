Till the Next Goodbye Lyrics
Honey, is there any place that you would like to eat?
I know a coffee shop down on Fifty-Second Street
And I don't need no fancy food and I don't need no fancy wine
And I sure don't need the tears you cry

Till the next time we say goodbye
Till the next time we say goodbye
Till the next time we say goodbye
I'll be thinking of you
I'll be thinking of you

Yeah, a movie house on Forty-Second Street
Ain't a very likely place for you and I to meet
Watching the snow swirl around your hair and around your feet
And I'm thinking to myself she surely looks a treat

Till the next time we say goodbye
Till the next time we say goodbye
Till the next time we kiss goodnight
I'll be thinking of you
I'll be thinking of you
I can't go on like this, can you? Can you?
I can't go on like this, can you?

You give me a cure-all from New Orleans
Now that's a recipe I sure do need
Some cider vinegar and some elderberry wine
May cure all your ills, but it can't cure mine
Your Louisiana recipes have let me down
Your Louisiana recipes have surely let me down

Till the next time that we say goodbye
Till the next time that we say goodbye
Until the next time that we kiss goodnight
Till the next time we say goodbye
Till the next time we say goodbye
Till the next time that we say goodbye
Till the next time we kiss goodnight
I'll be thinking of you
I'll be thinking of you1Embed
