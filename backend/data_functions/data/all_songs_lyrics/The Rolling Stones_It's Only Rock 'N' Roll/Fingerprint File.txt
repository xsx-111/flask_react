Fingerprint File Lyrics
Fingerprint file, you get me down
You keep me running, know my way around
(Yes, you do, child)

Fingerprint file, you bring me down
Keep me running, you keep me on the ground
Know my moves way ahead of time
Listening to me on your satellite

Feeling followed, feeling tagged
Crossing water, trying to wipe my tracks

And there's some little jerk in the FBI
A keeping papers on me six feet high
It gets me down
It gets me down
It gets me down

You better watch out on your telephone
Wrong number, they know you ain’t home
And there's some little jerk in the FBI
A keeping papers on me six feet high
It gets me down
It gets me down
It gets me down

Who's the man on the corner?
That corner
I don't know
Well, you better lay low
Watch out

Keep on the look out, electric eyes
Rats on the sell-out who going to testify
You know my habits way ahead of time
Listening to me on your satellite

And there's some little jerk in the FBI
A keeping papers on me six feet high
It gets me down
It gets me down
It gets me down
It gets me down
Hello, baby, mm-hmm
Ah, yeah, you know we ain’t, we ain’t talking alone
Who's listening? But I don't really know
But you better tell the SIS to keep out of sight
Because I know they taking pictures on the ultraviolet light
Yes, uh-huh, yeah, but these days it's all secrecy - no privacy
Shoot first, that's right, you know
Bye-bye
Who's listening?
Right now somebody is listening to you
Keeping their eyes peeled on you
Mmm, mmm, what a price, what a price to pay
All right
Good night, sleep tightEmbed
