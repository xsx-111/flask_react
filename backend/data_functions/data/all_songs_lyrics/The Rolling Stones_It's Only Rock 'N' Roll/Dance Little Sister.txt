Dance Little Sister Lyrics
On Thursday night she looked a fright
Her pricky hair all curled, oh what a sight
Dance, dance, little sister, dance

On Friday night, she all decked out
Her high heel shoes, her dress so tight
Dance, dance, little sister, dance

On Saturday night she bass-a-dee
She stepping high on Frederick Street
Dance, dance, little sister, dance

I said, "Dance, dance little sister, dance
Dance little sister, dance
Dance little sister, dance"
I said, "Dance, dance little sister, dance
Dance little sister, dance
Dance little sister, dance"

It make me hot, I wet with sweat
It burn like hell, I've four hours left
Dance, dance, little sister, dance
Get next to me, drive me close
Don't mama guy, I lose control
Dance, dance papaya, dance

I said, "Dance, dance little sister, dance
Dance little sister, dance
Dance little sister, dance"
I said, "Dance, dance little sister, dance
Dance little sister, dance
Dance little sister, dance"

Ah, jump out of Africa
With a step that looks so bold
Ah, when you're kickin' high
It make my blood run cold


I said, "Dance, dance little sister, dance
Dance little sister, dance
Dance little sister, dance"
I said, "Dance, dance little siste
Dance little sister
Dance little sister, dance"
I said, "Dance, dance little sister
Dance, dance little sister, dance"
On Saturday night we don't go home
We bacchanal, ain't no dawn
Dance, little sister, dance

I said, "Dance, dance little sister
Dance little sister
Dance little sister, dance"
I said, "Dance, dance little sister
Dance little sister
Dance little sister, dance"Embed
