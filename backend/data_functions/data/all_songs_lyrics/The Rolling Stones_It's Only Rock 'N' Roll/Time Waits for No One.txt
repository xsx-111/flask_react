Time Waits for No One Lyrics
Yes, star-crossed in pleasure
The stream flows on by
Yes, as we're sated in leisure
We watch it fly, yes

And time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me
And time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me

Time can tear down a building
Or destroy a woman's face
Hours are like diamonds
Don't let them waste

Time waits for no one
No favors has he
Time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me

Men, they build towers to their passing
Yes, to their fame everlasting
Here he comes chopping and reaping
Hear him laugh at their cheating
And time waits for no man
And it won't wait for me
Yes, time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me

Drink in your summer
Gather your corn
The dreams of the night time
We will vanish by dawn

But time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me
And time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me
No, no, no, not for me, no, not for meEmbed
