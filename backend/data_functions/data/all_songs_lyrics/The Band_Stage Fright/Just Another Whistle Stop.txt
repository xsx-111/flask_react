Just Another Whistle Stop LyricsTo all concerned dead or alive
The locomotive will arrive
Bringin' souls from all around
They'll be bound for higher ground
Look out, stranger, it's comin' through
With plenty of room for me and you
And it's just another whistle stop
If you don't quit till we reach the top
I'd be much obliged to you
Odd man out
You know that's the rule
You can scream and you can shout
But they'll only call you a crazy fool
Pay no mind to what they say
When they're 'bitter they talk that way
I seen a young boy on the run
And I seen other children havin' fun
A police siren flashing light
I wonder who went down tonight
People, people, where do you go
Before you believe in what you know ?
It's just another whistle stop
If you don't quit till we reach the top
I'd be much obliged to you
When the trolley is clean out of reach
A certain lesson it will teach
To grind your ax until it's dull
You've got to get it in your skull
Tell the people all across the sea
Don't turn your back because it's free
It's just another whistle stop
If you don't quit till we reach the top
I'd, I'd be much obliged to you
And it's odd man out
You know that's the rule
You can scream and you can shout
But they'll only call you a crazy fool
Pay no mind to what you read
There's one way home that's guaranteedEmbed
