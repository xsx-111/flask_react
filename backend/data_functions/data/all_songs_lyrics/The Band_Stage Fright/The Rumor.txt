The Rumor LyricsNow when the rumor comes to your town
It grows, it grows, where it started no one knows
Some of your neighbors will invite it right in
Maybe it's a lie, even if it's a sin, they'll repeat the rumor again
Close your eyes, hang down your head
Until a fog blows away, let it blow away
Open up your arms and feel the good
It's a'comin', a brand new day
Big men little men turn into dust
Maybe it was all in fun, didn't mean to ruin no one
Could there be someone among this crowd
Who's been accused had his name so misused and his privacy refused
Close your eyes, hang your head
Until a fog blows away, let it blow away
Open up your arms and feel the good
It's a'comin', a brand new day
Now all you vigilantes want to make a move
Maybe they won't, you know I sure hope they don't
For whether this rumor proves true or false
You can forgive, a'you can regret, but you can never ever forget
Close your eyes, hang down your head
Until a fog blows away
Open up your arms and feel the good
It's a'comin', a brand new dayEmbed
