Just Like Birds LyricsLittle johanna girl of my prairie
Help me fill this house with living words
Further up an' further in
Let 'em fly from our lips
Just like birds
Just like birds
All that dark woods from pakistan
The glory the glory lodged inside
Strive to enter the narrow gate child
To the fountain that flows deep an' wide
He will never leave you
My much afraid
He waits patient
In our prayers unprayed
Now stay close to me
In an' amongst the trees
I'll carry your shoes child
You run an' play beneath the eaves
Our faith will come by the hearin'
A whisper in the leaves
Listen johanna hear his voice
In the drone of the bees
He will never leave you
My much afraid
He waits patient
In our prayers unprayedEmbed
