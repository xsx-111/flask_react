Praying Arm Lane LyricsWell hey I been down that a way
With a dream on my arm
Yet me an' my love we could not stay
We heard voices of children
An' by little hands were led astray
All the boughs bend for us
All the earth awaits thee
All the stones they will cry out
An' ev'ry tongue confess thee
Oh my dream come an' take me quickly
'fore the struggle take me
Yeah lay me down any way you choose
An' let the voices of our children wake me
The boughs they all will bend for us
An' all the earth awaits thee
All the stones they will cry out
Yes an' ev'ry tongue confess thee
An' though the word yes
It falls on deaf ears
It is spoken jus' the same
The word is stands
Look straight at ev'ry man
From kings down to the lay
Well I told it fast an' glad
The color of a sloe drink
Or so they say
So they say by the light of day
Hidden 'neath their wings
Of black, brown an' grey
The boughs they all will bend for us
An' all the earth awaits thee
All the stones they will cry out
An' ev'ry tongue confess thee
An' though the word yes
It falls on deaf ears
It is spoken jus' the same
The word is stands
Look straight at ev'ry man
From kings down to the layEmbed
