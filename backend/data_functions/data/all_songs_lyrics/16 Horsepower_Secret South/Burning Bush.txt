Burning Bush LyricsAll the widows watch
Through all window sills
Hair raisin' in every room
Up the street come a walkin' chill
An' you ask for nothin'
'cept to be by my side
See my tears good father
Will they wash it away
All my dirt from your holy feet
No I don't believe it works that way
'cause you ask for nothin'
'cept to be by my side
I seen you in the river
Before god an' man
Held by the holy hand of winter
Brought low by winter's holy hand
Yes my sister girl
I know that it is true
You see me with the lord's eye girl
An' you see right through
An' you ask for nothin'
Is there somethin' behind my eyes
I can look good I swear
When the spirit blows
All ore an' all through yeah
My wretched bones
An' you ask for nothin'
'cept to be by my side love
I seen you in the river
Before god an' man
Held by the holy hand of winter
Brought low by winter's holy handEmbed
