Clogger LyricsHey mister with your iron feet yeah
Never waver from your path
You think you got a way with somethin' boy
Well see his hand an' feel his staff
Hey you got a way with words alright yeah
An' quite a way with the ladies
Your thoughts are troubled
As you hang a left
No there ain't no maybes
Come an' sing me down
Give my conscience a poundin'
Come an' shake my ground lord
With the sound of heaven's houndin'
You're thinkin' when this is all over
We'll all sit back an' laugh
Well I don't think so friend 'cause
I done the math
And I ain't lookin' to gain any honor
No, no not among you thieves
I'll be right beside you though
In judgement on my knees
Come an' sing me down
Give my conscience a poundin'
Come an' shake my ground lord
With the sound of heaven's houndin'
Now here you come a draggin'
Jus' couldn't help yourself
Puttin' on your poor mouth an'
Takin' from his wealth
O you come up proper
You ride a faithless steed
Took you down the wrong road
Ye' in word an' in deed
Come an' sing us down
Give our conscience a poundin'
Come an' shake our ground lord
With the sound of heaven's houndin'
Come an' take our crowns lord
Give our conscience a poundin'
Come an' take our crown lord
With the sound of heaven's houndin'Embed
