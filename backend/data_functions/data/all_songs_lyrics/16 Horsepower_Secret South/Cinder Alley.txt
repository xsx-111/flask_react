Cinder Alley LyricsLovely lovely carol sue
I see the heel of the father
Crush the head of the serpent for you
An' that beast who found
His way up to your room
You know the one the one
Who's colors are never true
Yeah you do
Yet all the while 'neath
His banner you did stand
'neath the shadow of his wing
Do you remember
Sorrow stands near an' close at hand
Sorrow stands an' in sorrow's hand
The burning ember
He'll come a cinder
Fire call the kettle black
The dark can only hinder it
It will not hold you back
Nor tear you asunder
And the good shepherd
Lo he left all the others
An' went to look for you
Yes an' he did find thee
An' with bruised hands
He did unbind thee
Brought you out
Into the light of day
He'll come a cinder
Fire call the kettle black
The dark can only hinder it
It will not hold you back
Nor tear you asunder
O come and stand with me mother
As we wait for the master's voice
An' head that way together
He'll come a cinder
Fire call the kettle black
The dark can only hinder it
It will not hold you back
Nor tear you asunderEmbed
