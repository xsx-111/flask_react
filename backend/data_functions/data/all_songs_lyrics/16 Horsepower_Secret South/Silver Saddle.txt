Silver Saddle LyricsTonight you've caught your breath
You've lost your american spirit
If only I could catch my death yeah
Jus' give me long enough to fear it
Her talk ain't like the other girls
She takes my livin' at a glance
We hear the locust's rasp back and forth
An' through the thoughts the past does dance
Do I waste my time
Yeah well you know it
An' as I stroll through the room
See my features show it
Feel the hand on my shoulder
Yeah it calls me to dwell
Take a breath hard an' clear yeah
Like a hammer on a church bellEmbed
