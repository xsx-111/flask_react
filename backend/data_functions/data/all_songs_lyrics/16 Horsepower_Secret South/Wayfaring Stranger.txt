Wayfaring Stranger LyricsI'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelin' through a world of woe
Ain't no sickness, toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go
I'm goin' there to see my Father
Said He'd meet me when I come
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I know dark clouds gonna gather 'round me
I know my way it'll be rough and steep
Yet beautiful fields lie just before me
Where God's redeemed did vigils keep
I'm goin' there to see my loved ones
Gone before me one by one
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I'll soon be free from earthly trials
This body rests in the orchard's yard
I'll drop this cross of self-denial
And go singing home to God
I'm goin' there to see my Savior
To dwell with Him no more to roam
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I'm only goin' over homeEmbed
