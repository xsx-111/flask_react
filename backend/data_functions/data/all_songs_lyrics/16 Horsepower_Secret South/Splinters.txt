Splinters LyricsSelf sent a twister
A tearin' after me
Gonna bust my house to splinters yes
An' take all that's dear to me
You say you saw it comin' yeah
But still you did not flee
I was too weak I couldn't move
Held by growth of a tree
An' yes I fell upon that rock
I did not die jus' badly broken
An' in time my healin' it will come yeah
By the words that he has spoken
I fell upon that rock
Who is it now that loves you
Straight in the front door
An' crooked out the back yeah
What is it now you're a slave to
On your knees out in your shack
I fell upon that rock yeah
He's beyond the shadow
Of your doubt an' mine
He's no man's opinion
He is truth divine
Self sent a twister
A tearin' after me
Done bust my house to splinters yeah
An' took all that's dear to me
Who is it now that loves you
Straight in the front door
An' crooked out the back yeah
What is it now that you pray to
As your world begins to crack
I fell upon that rock yeah
He's beyond the shadow
Of your doubt an' mine
He's no man's opinion
He is truth divine
An' yes I fell upon that rock
I did not die jus' badly broken
An' in time my healin' came yeah
By the words that he had spokenEmbed
