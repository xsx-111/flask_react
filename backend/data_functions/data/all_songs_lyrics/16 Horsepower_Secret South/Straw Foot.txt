Straw Foot LyricsI guess you didn't hear me
When I told you for the first time
Well don't you worry
It won't be the last
All I need a floorboard
An' a wooden shoe
Step aside an' let my lady through
Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hey foot, straw foot
Up an' back around
See the high priest
He took my place
When the judge looks to me
He saw his son's face
Not gonna join you in
Your tower of babble, boy
Tired o' that talkin'
I'm sick o' that noise
Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hey foot, straw foot
Coverin' ground
I'm not alone
An' looks can be deceivin'
When we get down to it
You're talkin' when you
Should be leavin'
I've been to nebraska
It reminded me of spain
All the questions loaded
All my answers same
Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hay foot, straw foot
Coverin' ground
Let us not mince our words
Let's say it true this time
I need your forgiveness
Just like you need mine
Tell me how it is that
You don't want what he's given
It ain't no sin son
To be forgiven
Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hey foot, straw foot
All over townEmbed
