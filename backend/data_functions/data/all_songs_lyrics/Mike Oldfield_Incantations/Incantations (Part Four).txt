Incantations (Part Four) LyricsQueen and huntress, chaste and fair
Now the sun is laid to sleep
Seated in thy silver chair
State in wonted manner keep
Earth, let not an envious shade
Dare itself to interpose
Cynthia's shining orb was made
Heav'n to clear when day did close
Lay thy bow of pearl apart
And thy crystal shining quiver
Give unto the flying hart
Space to breathe, how short soever
Hesperus entreats thy light
Goddess excellently bright
Bless us then with wished sight
Thou who makest a day of nightEmbed
