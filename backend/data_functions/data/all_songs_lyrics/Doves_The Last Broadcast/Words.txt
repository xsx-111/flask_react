Words Lyrics
Inside a heart of summer soul
Don't let them take it away
Cause inside's something solid gold
So don't let them throw it away

Words, they mean nothing
So you can't hurt me
I said words, they mean nothing
So you can't stop me
I said your eyes, they say nothing
So you can't hurt me
(On summer days like these)
I said words they mean nothing
So you can't hurt me

Follow your own path from here
So don't listen to what they say
(They don't know nothing)
Cause inside, you've a heart of gold
So don't let them take this away
Words, they mean nothing
So you can't hurt me
(On summer days like these)
I said words, they mean nothing
So you can't stop me
(On summer days like these)
I said your eyes, they say nothing
So you can't fault me
I said words, they mean nothing
So you can't hurt me

Inside a heart of pure soul
A sun rising and falling away, like your soul
Cause here comes something wonderful
So don't let them throw it away

Words, they mean nothing
So you can't hurt me
(On summer days like these)
I said words they mean nothing
So you can't stop me
(On summer days like these)
I said your eyes, they say nothing
So you can't stop me
(On summer days like these)
I said words, they mean nothing
So you can't hurt meEmbed
