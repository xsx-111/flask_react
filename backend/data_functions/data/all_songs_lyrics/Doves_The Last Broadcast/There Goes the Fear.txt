There Goes the Fear Lyrics
Out of here
We're out of here
Out of heartache
Along with fear
There goes the fear again
There goes the fear
And cars speed fast
Out of here
And life goes past
Again so near
There goes the fear again
There goes the fear
Close your brown eyes
And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down
Cause there goes the fear
Let it go

You turn around and life's passed you by
You look to ones you love to ask them why
You look to those you love to justify
You turned around and life's passed you by
Passed you by again
And late last night
Makes up her mind
Another fight
Left behind
There goes the fear again
Let it go
There goes the fear
Close your brown eyes
And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down
'Cos there goes the fear
Let it go


Think of me when you're coming down
But don't look back when leaving town
Oh think of me when he's calling out
But don't look back when leaving town
Think of me when you close your eyes
But don't look back when you break all ties
Think of me when you're coming down
But don't look back when leaving town today
There goes the fear again
Let it go
There goes the fear
Let it go
Think of me when you close your eyes
But don't look back when you break all ties
Think of me when you're coming down
But don't look back when leaving town today1Embed
