Last Broadcast Lyrics
I was thinking about what you said
I was thinking about shame
The funny thing you said
Cause it's better not to stay
Sure enough if you feel nothing
You're better off this way
Gets to the point where you can't breathe
It's the last word
I can see it standing

So here we are
At the last broadcast
Here we are
Our last broadcast

Sun on faces made us feel alive
The colors of the sky
Southern trees, made us enemies
Who knows the reason why?
You can't escape yourself
You can't just fall away
It comes to the point when you feel nothing
This is the last time
Cause I can see it in your eyes
