M62 Song LyricsMoonshine, waiting for a love that never comes
Moonshine, wish it were a time that never was
Waiting for a time, the truth to call
Waiting for a sign, show me all
Waiting for my love
Moonshine, drinking to a love that's gone on by
Moonshine, looking to the stars as cars go by
Waiting for a time, truth to call
Waiting for a sign, show me all
Waiting for a love
Waiting for a time, truth to call
Waiting for a sign, show me all
Waiting for a love
Waiting for a love
Waiting for my love
Waiting for my love
Moonshine, waiting for a love that never comes
