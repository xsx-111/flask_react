Hit the Ground Running LyricsI hit the ground with the running at last
I didn't stop to look behind
Yeah, bad times are all in the past
I hit the ground with the running at last, all right
Ooooh, Yeah!
Ooooh, Yeah!
I hit the ground with the running at last
I said I can't wait to get in a car
Your foot's down, the city's so far
You're past the suburbs and speeding so fast
I hit the ground running at last
Ooooh, Yeah!
Ooooh, Yeah!
I hit the ground running at last
The light's still spinning upon your eyes
I hit the brakes, it's the end of line
You're way past the suburbs and speeding so fast
I hit the ground running at last
Ooooh, Yeah!
Ooooh, Yeah!
I hit the ground with the running at last
I hit the ground with the running at lastEmbed
