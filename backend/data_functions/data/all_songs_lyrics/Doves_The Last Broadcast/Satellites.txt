Satellites LyricsI want you to know this
My anger's all but done
Sweet Lord, I swear I've seen the darkness
Sweet Lord, I swear I've seen some pain
Satellites ahead, so hold on
Satellites I said, so come on
Here comes a strange cargo
Here comes a light that leaves out of here
Sweet Lord, all I've known is badness
Sweet Lord, all I've known is pain
Satellites ahead, so hold on
Satellites I said, so come on
For seven nights I slept, hold on
The satellites ahead, so come on
I want you to notice
My anger's all but done
And all I've known is madness
Satellites ahead, so hold on
For seven nights I slept, so come on
So hold on
So come onEmbed
