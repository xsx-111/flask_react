Willow Song LyricsHey, ooh, who is there?
Please come, say how do
The things that I can't show to you
A stroke as gentle as a feather
Hey, ooh, who is me?
Am I not young and fair?
Please come, say how do
The things that I can't give to you
Would you have a wondrous sight?
The moon light, the midday sun
At midnight
