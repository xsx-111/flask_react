The Sulphur Man Lyrics
Fate
Bought you
Brought you next to ghosts
They
Talk in code
Looking for the way out
I hope, I hope
I hope you want to live a day
And learn to cope
I hope you find what matters

Through the streets and on your own
Almost lost and almost home
We'll be looking all we can
We'll be searching for the sulphur man

Pills stopped you
Stopped you feeling life
Fall
Into a hole
Sympathy and all
A soul in tatters
A soul as black as coal
I hope, I hope
I wish you could find what matters
