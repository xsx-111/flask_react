Intro Lyrics(Speaking)
What we gonna do right here
Is take you way back
Way back into time
My man Ginuwine
For all y'all people out there
Bobby to the speaker
It's sung by me
Now, Ginuwine speaking
Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (maybe maybe)
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold (too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (why)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Ooh ooh ooh - baby
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (a world so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold (you know, you know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (why)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cryEmbed
