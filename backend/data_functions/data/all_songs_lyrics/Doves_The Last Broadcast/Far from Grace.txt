Far from Grace LyricsIf you should fall
If you should fall
Far from grace
If you should call
On him
Wake up to the music again
You can feel sunlight
In your eyes
Living is so useless 'round here
The city's so dangerous
On your own
How beauty dies young
But if you should fall
Oh, if you should flow
From grace
How beauty
Beauty fades
If you should fold
If you should fail
Far from grace
Far from grace
Oh, oh beauty
You could knowEmbed
