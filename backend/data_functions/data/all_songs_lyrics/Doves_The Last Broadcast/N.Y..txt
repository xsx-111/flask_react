N.Y. LyricsThey're throwing rocks and paving stones
So lets go while we can
Put your finger on the map
Who cares where it lands
Cause we're all better off in New York
On the road and out of town
We're moving on again
Everything they say is true
This city is insane
Every possibility
Nothing's left to chance
They're throwing rocks and pavings stones
Who says it has to last?
On the run
Till we're caught in New York
Cause we're all better dead
Than be caught
Maybe best not to talk
Till New York
Cause we're all better off in New York
On the run
Till we're caught in New York
Cause we're all better off
In New York
On the run
Till we're caught
In New York
On the run
Till we're caught
In New York
On the run
Till we're caught
In New YorkEmbed
