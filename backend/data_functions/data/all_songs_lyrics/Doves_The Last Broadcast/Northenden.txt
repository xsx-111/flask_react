Northenden LyricsFuck Longsight
And Levenshulme
Same goes for Stockport and Hulme
We doing alright
Just post-house blues
Cos this is northenden in the afternoon
The kids are deranged
They love guns and kidnap
Thats just the way we do things here
The day dies down
Not a moment too soon
Under the northenden afternoon
Northenden afternoonEmbed
