Peace of Mind Lyrics
You know it takes a long, long time 
You love her so and still you know
That you will never want to let her go
Unless you leave her first
Then you come out on top
But, still there's just one thing
You haven't got

Peace of mind
Like when you treated her kind
It's hard to face that open space

You know it takes a long, long time 
When first you gave and shared your soul
Showed her all those things that take their toll
She knows your weak spot
But, she still gets you hot
So you do it again
Reveal what lies within

And go for peace of mind
Like when you treated her kind
It's hard to face that open space
You're looking for peace of mind
Anywhere you can find
Still searching for peace of mind
You know it takes a long, long time Embed
