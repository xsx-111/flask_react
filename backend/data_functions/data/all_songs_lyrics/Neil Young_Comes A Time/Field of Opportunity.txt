Field of Opportunity Lyrics
I've been wrong before
And I'll be there again
I don't have any answers my friend
Just this pile of old questions
My memory left me here
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again
I'm going back to my house
But I'm not going now
It's too early
To be leaving here, somehow
Let me bore you with this story
"How my lover let me down"
While I borrow seeds of sadness
From the ground

In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again
There ain't no way of telling
Where these seeds will rise or when
I'll just wait around until springtime
And then, I'll find a friend
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again
When I'm all done cultivating
I'll be rocking on the porch
Trying to picture
You and where you are
And there'll be no hesitating
When Cupid lights the torch
With those headlights coming down the hill
Between the stars
