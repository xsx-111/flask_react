Look Out for My Love Lyrics
There's a lot to learn
For wasting time
There's a heart that burns
There's an open mind

Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
You own it, you own it now, you own it

There's a weight on you
But you can't feel it
Living like I do
It's hard for you to see it
Was I hurt too bad
Can I show you daylight
How could I be sad
When I know that you might

Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
It's in your neighborhood
I know things are gonna change
But I can't say bad or good
Silver wings of morning
Shining in the gray day
While the ice is forming
On a lonely runway
Hydraulic wipers pumping
Until the window glistens
Something saying something
No one seems to listen
Men with walkie-talkies
Men with flashlights waving
Up upon the tower
Time reads daylight savings
I'm home again to you babe
You know it makes me wonder
Sitting in the quiet slipstream
In the thunder
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my loveEmbed
