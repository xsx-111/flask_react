Motorcycle Mama Lyrics
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
I always get in trouble
When you bring it round
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down

I'm running 
Down the proud highway
Yeah
I'm runnin 
Down the proud highway
And as long as I keep moving
I won't need a place to stay


Well I'm here to deliver
I hope you can read my mail
I just escaped last night
From the memory county jail
I see your box is open
And you flag is up
My message is ready
If there's time enough
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
I always get in trouble
When you bring it round
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it downEmbed
