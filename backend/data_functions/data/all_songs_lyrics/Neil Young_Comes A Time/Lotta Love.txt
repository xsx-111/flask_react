Lotta Love LyricsIt's gonna take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love
Or we won't get too far
So if you look in my direction
And we don't see eye to eye
My heart needs protection
And so do I
It's gonna take a lotta love
To get us thru the night
It's gonna take a lotta love
To make things work out right
So if you are out there waitin'
I hope you show up soon
'Cause my head needs relatin'
Not solitude
Gotta lotta love
Gotta lotta love
It's gonna take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love
Or we won't get too far
It's gonna take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love
Or we won't get too farEmbed
