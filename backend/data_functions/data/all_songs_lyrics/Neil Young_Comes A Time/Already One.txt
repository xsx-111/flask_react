Already One Lyrics
What can I do, what can I say
Running down
This suspicious highway
I can't forget how love let me down
And when we meet it still gets in my way

But we're already one
Already one
Now only time can come between us
Because we're already one
Our little son won't let us forget

Your laughing eyes, your crazy smile
Every time I look in his face
I can't believe how love lasts a while
And looks like "forever" in the first place


In my new life I'm traveling light
Eyes wide open for the next move
I can't go wrong 'til I get right
But I'm not falling back in the same groove
