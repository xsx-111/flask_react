Generation Fade LyricsIt was a movement of the people, like many times before
Who stood up for peace and sat down for war
They ran from the ways, the old school ways
Fight those different, kill to be saved
These theories came straight from their minds
Their hearts left trembling, deep down inside
Well i know, now know, i know , now know.... what lies beneath...
These views may change if we all walk this way
The youth steer the ship as this generation fades
These views may change if we all walk this way
The youth steer the ship as this generation fades
Let's move to the middle, embrace one and all
See the beauty through the skin of the Aboriginal
If your friend has fear, then help him to heal
Show him the difference gives this world appeal
Well we are so lucky today
The earth as our playground - it's culture to amaze
Well i know now know i know now know.. what lies beneath...
These views may change if we all walk this way
The youth steer the ship as this generation fades..
These views may change if we all walk this way
The youth steer the ship as this generation fades..
These views may change if we all walk this way
The youth steer the ship as this generation fades..
These views may change if we all walk this way
The youth steer the ship as this generation fades..Embed
