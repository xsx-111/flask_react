September 24, 1999 LyricsA relaxed state of worry
Predicted fate seems constructed
And by the car tremors were lightly shaded
While the radiator's overheating
So then when I remove the cap
Do I speak, where do I stand?
For now our judge my fear just serve as tension
For hers is so far from home
Germinating seed from the positive
Germinating deep inside my heart
And it will gnaw through the negatives
As it grows on
Cause I won't fall away from this
Nothing you say will make me twist
I won't fall away from this
Nothing you say will make me twist
Black clouds seem thick
When they cover all your stars
There'll be days when you will sit
You'll let them swallow your spark
But the fear is in the wind
Without choice in the dark
And then again there's ice cream
And so much hype, and so much talk
With human beings comes so much hate and violence
But you can always seek love and support
And I keep hoping, frustrated
For my gift to be served
And my foolish insecurity
Ignores the guidance from those clear and in touch
Look there's belief from the feeders
And true belief from some who love
And now it's growing inside the one sent to me
By her heart
Cause I won't fall away from this
Nothing you say will make me twist
And I won't fall away from this
Nothing you say will make me twist
So I'll take the test presented
And I will force it back inside its home
Cause my heart will win
