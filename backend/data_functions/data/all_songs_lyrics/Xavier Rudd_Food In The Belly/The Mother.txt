The Mother LyricsDo you feel it in the sunshine
Do you feel it in the rain
Do you feel it in the ocean
When the waves are clean
Do you feel it in the evening
When the moon is up
Do you feel it in your bones
When she fills you up
Oh yeah she breathes good luck
Mother Earth Mother Earth
She breathes good luck
Do you feel it on the inside
Do you feel it on the out
Do you feel it when you're up up
Do you feel it when you're down
Do you feel it in the mountains
When the powder falls
Do you feel it on the water
No wind at allEmbed
