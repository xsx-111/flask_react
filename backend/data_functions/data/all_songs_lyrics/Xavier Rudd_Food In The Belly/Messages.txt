Messages Lyrics
So now come sit down
Will you talk with me now?
Let me see through your eyes
Where there is so much life
We are biding our time
For these myths to unwind
These changes we will confront
So please beware
With every place that you had
And look to your soul
For these things that you know
For the trees that we see
Cannot forever breathe
With the changes they will confront

You know some people
They just won't understand
No, they just won't understand these things
Thank you for your message
But I don't understand
No, I just won't understand these things

And this sacred land it has
Seen many hands, it has
Wealth and gold yet it is
Fragile and old and all the
Greedy souls just don't care to know
Of the changes it will confront
So speak out loud of the
Things you are proud
And if you love this coast then
Keep it clean as it evolves
Cos the way that it shines
May just dwindle with time
With the changes it will confront

You know some people
They just won't understand
No, they just won't understand these things
Thank you for your message
But I don't understand
No, I just won't understand these things
You know some people
They just won't understand
No, they just won't understand these things
Thank you for your message
But I don't understand
No, I just won't understand these things

So hold nice and close
The ones that get to your soul
So that when it is cold
You won't feel so alone
Cos the roads that you take
May just crack and break
With the changes you will confront
With each gift that you share
You may heal and repair
With each choice you make
You may help someone's day
Well I know you are strong
May your journey be long
And now I wish you the best of luck
Well I know you are strong
May your journey be long
And now I wish you the best of luck

You know some people
They just won't understand
No they just won't understand these things
Thank you for your message
But I don't understand
No, I just won't understand these thingsEmbed
