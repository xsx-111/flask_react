Pockets of Peace LyricsHere and now our choices here are growing thin
As children grow they grow with what they see
In these times where paranoia closes in
Power and hate a rampaging disease
In our minds we build the blocks to what we need
In our minds we are reaching out for peace
In our hearts we know of such the hills to climb
In our hearts a sense of mass defeat
Shame shame these games that they play with you and me
Shame for these games that they play our children will keep
These are our times this problem much to big to hold
For you and I itâ€™s far too high to reach
We can begin by holding close the things we know
And valuing our pockets of peace
These are the earth the sun the moon the sea the sky
These are the gifts to which we all agree
Through these things and those we love we can unite
And sink into our pockets of peaceEmbed
