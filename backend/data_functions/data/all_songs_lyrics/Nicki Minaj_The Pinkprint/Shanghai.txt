Shanghai Lyrics
On the real, nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
O-o-o-on the real, nigga, I’m a real nigga
I-I-I run around with them real niggas
Roll up on ya
R-r-roll up on ya, roll up on ya
Yo, yo (R-r-r-r-roll up on ya)

E-e-eight mil' on that new thing
Tied up like my shoe string
Ain’t fuckin' wit' you bitch niggas and that’s real rap, but I do sing
Make room when I come by
Ain’t speakin', I’m dumb high
Just heard niggas got jokes, it’s a matter of time before one dies
'Cause them dudes out and them tools out
All sixes like school’s out
Niggas know if they talk slick
That I’m winter fresh, they’ll get chewed out
‘Cause-'cause-'cause-'cause them dudes out and them tools out
All sixes like school’s out
Niggas know if they talk slick
That I’m winter fresh, they’ll get chewed out (Uh)
Th-th-th-this shit ain’t regular rich (Uh)
So they end up in a ditch (Uh)
I’m not a regular bitch
So when niggas see me, they jump on my dick (Uh)
He not a regular shooter (Uh)
So when you see me, salute her (Uh)
Ain’t got a knife in my hand
But I’m choppin’ it up with some niggas from Cuba (Uh)
On the real, nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
O-o-o-on the real, nigga, I’m a real nigga
I-I-I run around with them real niggas
Roll up on ya
R-r-roll up on ya, roll up on ya
R-r-r-r-roll up on ya (Yo)

A-a-ask Jay who he married
Eighty thousand in Paris
Stadiums with Queen B and that selfie got 'em aggy
These-these bitches is light-weight
I-I’m always at fight-weight
Wrist game is on ice skate
'Cause we move work through that Tri-State
‘Cause them boys out and them toys out
Still bangin' that noise out
You could get it in the wintertime
Or that May weather like Floyd’s out
‘Cause them boys out and them toys out
Still bangin' that noise out
You-you could get it in the wintertime
Or that May weather like Floyd’s out (Uh)
A-a-a-all of these bitches in pocket (Uh)
I’m ‘bout to make a deposit (Uh)
Tell ‘em to go ‘head and gossip
As long as your house is the size of my closet (Uh)
Anybody I call, they picks up (Uh)
Even if they was gettin’ they dick sucked (Uh)
These niggas don’t make a mix-up
Tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up
Tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up
Tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up
On the real, nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
O-o-o-on the real, nigga, I’m a real nigga
I-I-I run around with them real niggas
Roll up on ya
R-r-roll up on ya, roll up on ya
R-r-r-r-roll up on ya
