Grand Piano Lyrics
Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for lovin' you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were...

The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just a frame in the dark

(And now the people) The people are talkin'
The people are sayin' that you have been playin' my heart
Like a grand piano (Piano)
The people are talkin'
The people are sayin' that you have been playin' my heart
Like a grand piano (Piano)

So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on

Am I queen of fools?
Wrapped up in lies and foolish jewels
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do
'Cause I keep thinkin' you are...
The one who had came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just a frame in the dark

The people are talkin'
The people are sayin' that you have been playin' my heart
Like a grand piano (Piano)
The people are talkin'
The people are sayin' that you have been playin' my heart
Like a grand piano (Piano)

So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on137Embed
