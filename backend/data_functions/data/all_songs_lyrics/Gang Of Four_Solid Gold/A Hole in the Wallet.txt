A Hole in the Wallet LyricsEducation is their business
Women to know that they are equal
Why work for love if it shows no profit
You'll only earn emotional losses
Wasting time a hole in the wallet
There is only one condition
Stay in bed or in the kitchen
Better not (you'll only earn emotional losses)
Disrupt their passions
Mirror reflect their teaching
Make up makes up for your nature
Make up makes up for your nature
You're for seeing and not for hearing
Their commands are in your interest
Why work for love if it shows no profit
You'll only earn emotional losses
Wasting times a hole in the wallet
Their commands are your interest
There is only one condition
You're for seeing and for the taking
Why work for love if it shows no profit
You'll only earn emotional losses
Wasting times a hole in the wallet
Better not (you'll only earn emotional losses)
Disrupt their passions
Education is their business
Women to know that they are equal
There is only one condition
Stay in bed or in the kitchenEmbed
