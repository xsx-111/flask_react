If I Could Keep It for Myself LyricsIf I could keep it for myself
What did you say I am confused
I don't remember what did we do last week
Can you imagine in the dark
Everything has been cynically shot it's gone
Are there no surprises anymore?
It was hot then it was cold
The view imagined in the dark
My heart sticking to my ribs
Your back's clammy with the heat
If I could keep it for myself
Can you imagine in the dark
Everything has been cynically shot it's gone
Are there no surprises anymore?
It was hot and it was cold
The view imagined in the dark
My heart was sticking to my ribs
Your back clammy with the heat
If I could keep it for myself x4
What did you say I am confused
I don't remember what I didn't do last week
Everything has been cynically shot it's gone
Are there no surprises anymore?
If I could keep it for myselfEmbed
