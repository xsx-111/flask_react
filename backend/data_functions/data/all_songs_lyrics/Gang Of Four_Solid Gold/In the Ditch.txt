In the Ditch LyricsHeads down, down to the floor
Run past the windows and close the door
Whatever you do stay calm
Show me a ditch and I'll dive in it
I'll feel safe beyond the cares of the world
Good news is prospect
Excluding the six feet under
Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor
Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor
Get down down to the floor
Under the table with the radio on
Whatever you do stay calm
The cupboard is stocked, the door is locked
I'll feel safe beyond the cares of the world
Good news is prospect
Excluding the six feet under
Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor
Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor
Show me a ditch and I'll dive in it
Show me a ditch and I'll dive in it
Show me a ditch and I'll dive in it
Show me a ditch and I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
Heads down, down to the floor
Run past the windows and close the door
Whatever you do stay calm
Show me a ditch and I'll dive it
I'll feel safe beyond the cares of the world
Good news is prospect
Excluding the six feet under
Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor
Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in itEmbed
