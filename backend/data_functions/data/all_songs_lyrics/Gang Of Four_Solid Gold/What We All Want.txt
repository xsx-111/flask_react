What We All Want LyricsThis wheel spins letting me off
It's not the lack of trying
Can't put my finger on it
You can't help being hard up
Can't trust the gods we trusted
Don't think that's any insurance
Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time
This wheel spins letting me off
These doubts and nagging worries
Nothing to work towards
This demon on my back
Preaches the razors cut
The hope that does not fade
Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time
This wheel spins letting me off
It's not the lack of trying
Can't put my finger on it
You can't help being hard up
Can't trust the gods we trusted
Don't think that's any insurance
Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time
Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time
What we want's not what we get2Embed
