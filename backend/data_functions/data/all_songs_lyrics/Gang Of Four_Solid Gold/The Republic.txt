The Republic LyricsMake the grade in our republic
We all are loyal subjects
The paper stirring dregs of no great causes
Action is none of my business
I'm unconcerned with what's in store
(I don't give a shit what's in store)
I'm unconcerned with what's in store
Better take smaller chances
And bugger with the consequences
Between the insults whirr and click
Connections made - some stick
Nationals in our republic
We all see the same subject
Each day we reason up some other causes
Action is none of my business
I'm unconcerned with what's in store
(I don't give a shit what's in store)
I'm unconcerned with what's in store
Better take smaller chances
And bugger with the consequences
Between the insults whirr and click
Connections made - some stick
Know your place in our republic
Talk of the future is our main subject
Rations - we'd like more but we make less noises
Action is none of my business
I'm unconcerned with what's in store
(I don't give a shit what's in store)
I'm unconcerned with what's in store
Better take smaller chances
And bugger the consequences
Between the insults whirr and click
Connections made - some stickEmbed
