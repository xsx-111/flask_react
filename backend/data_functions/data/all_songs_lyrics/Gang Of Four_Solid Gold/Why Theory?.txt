Why Theory? LyricsWe've all got opinions
Where do they come from?
Each day seems like a natural fact
And what we think changes how we act
We've all got opinions
Where do they come from?
Distant thunder from the east
Won't disturb a morning car wash
Each day seems like a natural fact
And what we think changes how we act
So to change ideas changes what we do
Too much thinking makes me ill
I think I'll have another gin
A few more drinks and it'll be all right
Each day seems like a natural fact
And what we think changes how we act
Each day seems like a natural fact
Each day seems like a natural fact
Each day seems like a natural fact
Each day seems like a natural factEmbed
