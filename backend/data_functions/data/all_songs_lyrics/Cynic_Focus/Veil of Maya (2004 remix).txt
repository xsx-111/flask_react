Veil of Maya (2004 remix) LyricsIn Maya's grip illusion transforms verity
Perceiving thus a delusive world of duality
Veil of Maya
Balance every joy with a grief
Dual scales of Maya
Earth's unending law of polarity
Ahamkara...veil of Maya
Illusion works impenetrable
Weaving webs innumerable
Her gay pictures never fail
Crowd each other veil on veil
Charmer who will be believed
By man who thirsts to be deceived
Maya subjects you
Veil of Maya
Chops and divides God's dream thoughts
The great divider
As we be subject to likes and disgust
Ahamkara...veil of Maya
Maya subjects you
Charmer who will be believed
By man who thirsts to be deceived
Veil of Maya
Balance every joy with a grief
Dual states of Maya
Earth's unending law of polarity
Veil of Maya
Chops and divides God's dream thoughts
The great divider
As we be subject to likes and disgust
Ahamkara...veil of MayaEmbed
