The Eagle Nature LyricsLearning, discerning, how to arrange
Thinking the haze will just not clear
Viewing, computing, our minds will stage
A vehicle inside, we feel the eagle nature
Everchanging river flows high and low
Panoramic vision is undefined
For unfocused consciousness, the eagle nature
Precaution for a stream of risk, the eagle nature
It sees changes clear
A crystal goblet so fragile and dear
Needs fill one step at a time
Noting the fall of a sparrow
Attending the slightest scratch of flesh
Earthly ambitions weigh their share
The vastness of life, it doesn't care
A crystal goblet so fragile and dear
Needs fill one step at a time
Earthly ambitions weigh their share
The vastness of life does not careEmbed
