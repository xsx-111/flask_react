Veil of Maya Lyrics
In Maya's grip illusion transforms verity
Perceiving thus a delusive world of duality

Veil of Maya
Balance every joy with a grief
Dual scales of Maya
Earth's unending law of polarity

Ahamkara
Veil of Maya

Illusion works impenetrable
Weaving webs innumerable
Her gay pictures never fail
Crowd each other veil on veil
Charmer who will be believed
By man who thirsts to be deceived
Maya subjects you

Veil of Maya
Chops and divides God's dream thoughts
The great divider
As we be subject to likes and disgust
Ahamkara
Veil of Maya

Maya subjects you
Charmer who will be believed
By man who thirsts to be deceived

Veil of Maya
Balance every joy with a grief
Dual states of Maya
Earth's unending law of polarity

Veil of Maya
Chops and divides God's dream thoughts
The great divider
As we be subject to likes and disgust

Ahamkara
