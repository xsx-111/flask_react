Uroboric Forms LyricsSelf is the universe, not separate
The state before the fall into self consciousness
Nothing is himself, everything is world

Primordial egg returns
Consciousness unborn
Pre-personal perfection
Bliss's scree yet untorn
Uroboric forms
Find itself as a separate entity
An ego germ is just beginning to be
Wherever there is other, there is fear
Birth, primal paradise
No gap distance or separation
Between self and environment
Unconditional omnipotence
Nothing is himself, everything is world

Primordial egg returns
Consciousness unborn
Pre-personal perfection
Bliss's scree yet untorn
Uroboric forms
Consciousness unborn
