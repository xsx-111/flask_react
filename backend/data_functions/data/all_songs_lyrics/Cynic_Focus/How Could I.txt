How Could I LyricsHow could I forget such a revelation
To love without fear and learn without question
How could I regret the meant occasions
I must begin this day again
Freedom and reason shine through
Paddle upon the clouds one's own canoe
How could I
Humility, take charge of me
Drown me in truth's modest waters
Loosen your grip identity
Free me from an ego's falter
Freedom and reason shine through
Love too often is only a dream
If I am harsh and unkind to myself
So I share these attitudes with you
Must I try? How could I?
Freedom and reason shine through
Paddle upon the clouds one's own canoe
Love's too often only a dream
If I am harsh and unkind to myself
So I share these attitudes with you
For in this spewing cavern of pride
How could I!Embed
