...goingtohell Lyrics
Are you afraid of me?
Because I'm afraid of you
Cause I'm afraid of what this could mean
And I'm afraid of what this could do

Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you
With you, with you, with you
I don't care, I'm in love, in love

Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner

These bittersweet notions of forever
Blossom and find me in my dreams
If we should die, I hope we die together
If not, at least I'll know just where we'll be

Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you
With you, with you, with you
I don't care, I'm in love, in love
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner


Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you  (Only you can save me I'm a sinner)
With you, with you, with you (Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner)
I don't care, I'm in love, in love (Only you can save me I'm a sinner) (Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner)

Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner, baby13Embed
