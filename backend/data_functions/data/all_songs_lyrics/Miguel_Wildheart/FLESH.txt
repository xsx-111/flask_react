FLESH Lyrics
FLESH!

Savage and an angel, we call out in tantrum
I got a grip on your throat, we would ride in tandem
And I think she bankrupt
Breathe, breathe, fast

Flesh
I need it, I'm a mess, now
I'm a slave to your flesh
Woman put me right where I belong

Skin on you is always
Calling me with your face
Wrap yourself around me, do whatever I say
Kiss me like a cream pie, sweet, sweet control

Flesh, addicted, yeah
I mean it, I'm a mess, now
I'm a slave to your flesh
Woman put me right where I belong
Fall on your faith like your faith for religion
The light in the way, you're begging for forgiveness
Lost summers here as we both bathe in sweet sin
Leave it to me, I'll give you something to believe in
(Kiss me) surrender (kiss me) to friction (kiss me)
This is body language (kiss me) and deep diction (kiss me)
I love it (kiss me), beg for it (kiss me), yeah, yeah, yeah

Flesh, addicted, yeah
Come here darling, help me tackle this darling
I don't wanna let go
All of a sudden baby, darling no
I'm a slave to your flesh
Woman put me right where I belong
