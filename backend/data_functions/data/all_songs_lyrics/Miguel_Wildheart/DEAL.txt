DEAL Lyrics
Lobby lobby for profit, I can make you go down
I can show you the money if you wanna know how
When you're ready, come and get me, I'm on Capitol Hill
Before I show you the money, let me slide you the bill

Want money? Got clout
I mean business, we mean business
Want money? Got clout
I mean business, we mean business
Give it to me
Like oh woah woah woah woah
Give it to me
Like oh woah woah woah woah
Give it to me
Like oh woah woah woah woah
Give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

No one's paying attention now, they just wanna dance
You could be holdin' the future in the palm of your hands
So when you're ready, come and get me, I'm on Capitol Hill
Before I show you the money, let me slide you the bill
Want money? Got clout
I mean business, we mean business
Give it to me
Want money? Got clout
I mean business, we mean business
Give it to me
Oh woah woah woah woah
(Woah woah woah oh)
Give it to me
Oh woah woah woah woah
(Woah woah woah oh)
Give it to me
Oh woah woah woah woah
(Woah woah woah oh)
Give it to me
(Oh, woah oh, oh)
Give it to me, give it to me
Oh no, gotta do it all the same
Give it to me, give it to me

All we want is clout
All we need is money
Gotta play the game
We can take it all the way
Ooaah
Want money? Got clout
(Want money? I got clout!)
I mean business, we mean business
Yeah give it to me
Want money? I got clout
I mean business, we mean business
Give it to me
Say oh woah woah woah woah
(Woah woah oh)
Give it to me
Say oh woah woah woah woah
(Woah woah oh)
Give it to me
Oh woah woah woah woah
(Woah woah oh)
Give it to me
Oh woah woah woah woah
Oh oh
Give it to me, Yes

(Oh woah woah)

(Oh woah woah)
Ah
Talk about it now
Who's really in control?
Oooo

(Oh woah woah)
Give it to me
(Say oh woah woah woah woah)
(Woah woah oh)
Give it to me
