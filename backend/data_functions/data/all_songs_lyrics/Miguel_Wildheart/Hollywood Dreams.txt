Hollywood Dreams Lyrics
Lost angel with an urgent set of
Jaded eyes, in this empty fixation
Sweet Hollywood sign, you're my salvation
Cokey scenes full of pipe dreams
Palm trees and a numb sensation
Chasing, uh-huh
Vivid schemes, put my name on a marquee
Oh baby, I'm still waiting for my big break, for fame sake

And we could be better than heroes baby, alright
We could fly higher than spaceships baby, all night long
Said could you help me find the magic man
He can make it all happen, alright
Lost Hollywood dreams
Lost Hollywood dreams

See the walk of fame became your religion woman
Unique as you are your faith is common
Now the walk of shame woman is reputation
Cheap thrills, fake friends, coke binge, what a numb sensation, chasing
Then he said, "honey I can put your face on the big screen
(Put me on it, put me on it)
Well aren't you looking for your big break?
Come here, for fame sake"
And we could be better than heroes baby, alright
We could fly higher than spaceships baby, all night long
Girl you're looking at the magic man
I can make it all happen, alright
Lost Hollywood dreams
Lost Hollywood dreams
And we could be better than heroes baby, alright
We could fly higher than spaceships baby, all night
Girl you're looking at the magic man
He can make it all happen, alright
Lost Hollywood dreams
Lost Hollywood dreams

Up and down Hollywood and Sunset
Up and down Jefferson and Crenshaw
Lost Hollywood dreams
Up and down Figueroa, Alameda, Slauson
West to Santa Monica Boulevard
Up and down Hollywood and Sunset
Up and down Jefferson and Crenshaw
Lost Hollywood dreams
Up and down Figueroa, Alameda, Slauson
West to Santa Monica Boulevard8Embed
