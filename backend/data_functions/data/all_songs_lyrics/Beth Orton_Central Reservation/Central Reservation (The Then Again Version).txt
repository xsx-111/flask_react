Central Reservation (The Then Again Version) Lyrics
Went down to a central reservation
In last night's red dress
And I can still smell you on my fingers
And taste you on my breath
I'm stepping through brilliant shades
Of the colour you bring
This time, this time, this time
Is fine just as it is

Today is whatever I want it to mean
Today is whatever I want it to mean

If this is where memories are made, well
Dreams do come true
Everything I ever took for granted
I want to see it through
I step through every shade
And the colour you bring
This time, this time, this time
Is fine just as it is

Today is whatever I want it to mean
Today is whatever I want it to mean
Whatever I want it to mean
Whatever I want it to mean
It's like
It's like
It's like

Living in the middle of the ocean
With no future, no past
And everything that's good right now
Well, I don't wish for it to last
I'll step through brilliant shades
Every colour you bring
This time, this time, this time
Is fine just as it is

And today is whatever I want it to mean
And today is whatever I want it to mean
Today, today is whatever I want it to mean
Today is whatever I want it to meanEmbed
