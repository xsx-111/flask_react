Stars All Seem To Weep Lyrics
Stayed true to the things I knew when I was younger
And food and love was all but left to hunger
Cause when I stray from my truth as I grow older
Too much leaves an empty hollow hunger

I think about you on a moonlit night
And the stars all seem to weep
When there's so much love to lose
There's never any time for sleep

Look at me doing all these things without you
We always laughed, and you were untrue
Where was it we tried hard not to go to?
I think that's how I finally came through

All the things we took for granted
The words still live on in my head
All the times I took for granted
All the words I never said

I think about you in the moonlit night
And the stars all seem to weep
When there's so much love to give
There's never any time for sleep, yeah
So I stayed true to the things I knew when I was younger
And human life was all but left to hunger
'Cause when I stray from the truth as I grow older
Too much leaves an empty hollow hunger
Too much leaves an empty hunger

Livin' without you
Livin' without you
Livin' without youEmbed
