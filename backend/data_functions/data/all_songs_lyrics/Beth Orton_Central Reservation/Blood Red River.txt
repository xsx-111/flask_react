Blood Red River Lyrics
Took a friend I found across some blood red river
Never did find my way home in time to forgive her

Why must people always want what they can't have?
Why must people always grab what they'd never grasp?

How do we get so far?
How do we move so fast away
From the lilac-lillied lake
I'm sure we used to stay
Is it only a dream away?

Took a raft I found across some blood red river
Never did find my home in time for my dinner

Why must people always want what they never had?
Why is it a crime to miss a part of you that's bled?

How do we get so far?
How do we move so fast away
From the lilac-lillied lake
I'm sure we used to stay
Is it only a dream away?
Only a dream away
Lost a friend I found down some blood red river
Never did find my way home in time to forget her

Why must people always want what they can't have?
Why must people always take, but forget to ask?

How do we get so far?
How do we move so fast away
From the lilac-lillied lake
Where I'm told we used to play
Is it only a dream away?
Only a dream, only a dream away
AwayEmbed
