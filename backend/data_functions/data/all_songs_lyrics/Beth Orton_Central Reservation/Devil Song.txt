Devil Song Lyrics
When the devil comes blowing through your door
You'll know there's trouble, and he's coming back for more
You better keep what is precious hidden under the floor
Or you better treat it so good it will never want for more

But looking back in retrospect
Did you ever really get what you'd expect?
Trying to rectify
Got lost a little further
You've been trying to justify
Find out how and where it came

Devil was your angel, but it's not no more
The devil was your angel, when you weren't sure

Do I tempt trouble to break through all these doors
Just to put a face to the voice which always home?
To fight for what is precious, to know what's under the floor
If I could treat it so good, I swear I'd never want for more

But when I found my peace
There was still mistakes
However painfully awaring every step I take
Trying to rectify
Got lost a little further
Well, I've been trying to justify
Find out how and where it came
The devil was my angel, now I'm just not sure
To travel as my angel there's always my whore

Gonna take you back down
I won't feel no shame
Till my dreams
Are my own again
Gonna take you right down, and I'll take the blame
Till my dreams are my own again
Here I am again

Devil was my angel, now I'm just not sure
To travel as my angel there's always my whore
Maybe you're an angel, tried to remember you're an angel
Remember you're an angel, if you're not sureEmbed
