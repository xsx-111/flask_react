So Much More Lyrics
It's another cold London night
I wrap his head around my shoulders tight
Please excuse me
Seems there's someone at my door
I wouldn't leave
But the need is so much more
So much more
So much more

It's another cold London day
And I'm always walking down the escalator
The up way
Please excuse me
I can't seem to get inside
I only wanted to know
If you're alive
You're alive
If you're alive
(I don't know how to live)
(I don't know how to live)

I can't see there's a day
There's a feeling up there
But I don't know what it is
Don't know what it means
Don't know what it means
So now I'm turning
Into the light
It always seems the further
When the end's in sight
Please excuse me
I just need to be outside
Only looking for air to breathe
Air to breathe
Air to breathe
I feel alive
(I feel so alive, it's cold tonight)
I don't know how to live
(Don't know how to live)
(Don't know how to live)Embed
