Love Like Laughter Lyrics
Some of the worst wrongs
Get righted on three chords
Like a promise
Or a kiss goodbye
When the sneer on your lips
Is the liveliest thing
Just alive enough to die

I open my heart
In my heart there's something telling me
To open my heart
Open my heart
Yeah, I've been blind
And all that's been lost
Is a short loop running round my mind

Love is like laughter
See it happen by chance
Like a promise
Be a kiss goodbye
When the smile on your lips
Is the liveliest thing
More alive than any sky I've seen
I open my heart
In my heart is there's something telling me
To open my heart
I open my heart
See I've been blind
And all that's been cut
Is a short loop running round my mind
I open my heart
In my heart there's something telling me
To open my heart
I open my heart
See I've been blind
And all that's been cut
Is a short loop running round my mind

It's just running round my mind
Running all the time
Running all the time
It's a short loop
A short loop
Running round my mindEmbed
