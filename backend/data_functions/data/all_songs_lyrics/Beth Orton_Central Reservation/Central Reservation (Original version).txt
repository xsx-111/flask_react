Central Reservation (Original version) Lyrics
Running down a central reservation in last night's red dress
And I can still smell you on my fingers and taste you on my breath;
Stepping through brilliant shades
Of the colour you bring
This time, this time, this time
Is whatever I want it to mean

If this is where memories are made
I'm gonna like what I see
And everything that I ever took for granted
I'm gonna let it be
I step through every shade
Of the colour you bring
This time, this time, this time
Is whatever I want it to mean

And everything and nothing is as sacred as we'd want it to be
When it's really all
Make it really all
Compared to what
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's like living in the middle of the ocean
With no future, no past
And everything that's good about now
Well, might just glide right past
I'm stepping through brilliant shades
Of the colour you bring
This time, this time, this time
Is fine just as it is

And everything is sacred here
And nothing is as sacred as I want it to be
When it's really all
Compared to what
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
