Pass In Time Lyrics
So much stays unknown till the time has come
Did you imagine you could ever be so strong
Then watch your fear just turn into relief?
Your sea of doubt become your own belief?
Though tears don't come to cry some grief away
The tears will help to keep your need at bay

So come on now, come on now, child
You're here just a while
Come on now, come on now, child
You're here just a while

A mother told me just before she died
My mother told me just before she died
"Oh darling, darling, don't you be like me
You will fall in love with the very first man you meet."
But mother, mother, some will never know;
The love that you have is still holding my soul

So come on now, come on now, child
You're here just a little while
Come on now, come on now, child
You're here just a while
You're here just a while
Here just a while

So much stays unknown till the time you are strong
Did you imagine you could ever feel so strong
And all your pain just turns into relief?
All your doubt becomes your own belief?
Though tears don't come to cry some grief away
The years will help to keep your need at bay

So come on now, come on now, child
You're here just a while
Come on now, come on now, child
You're here just a while
So come on now, come on now, child
You're here just a while
Come on now, come on now, child
You're here just a while

You're here just a while
Here just a while
You're here just a while
You might as well smile
You might as well smile
'Cause tomorrow, you just don't know
It will pass. It's gonna pass
It will pass in time
It will pass in time
It will pass
It will pass in time
It will pass in time
It will pass
It's gonna pass
It's gonna pass
It's gonna pass in time
It will pass in time
It will pass
It's gonna pass...
It will pass in time
It's gonna pass
It's gonna passEmbed
