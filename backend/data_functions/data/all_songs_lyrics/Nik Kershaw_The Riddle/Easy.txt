Easy LyricsHold me up, i'm falling over
Got the jackal at my door
Got a chip upon my shoulder
But i still come back for more
Phone me up, i'm feeling lonely
Got the radio up loud
With my comfortable position
And my cottage in the clouds
Easy we come, easy we go
Little we learn, little we know
No place to rest, no space to grow
Easy we come, easy we go
Wind me up, i'm boxing shadows
Got a pocket full of fluff
Got a sturdy constitution
But i don't think thats enough
Easy we come, easy we go
Little we learn, little we know
No place to rest, no space to grow
Easy we come, easy we go
Easy we go
Wake me up i'm fast asleep
And i've forgotten who i am
Got a trivial ideal
And a temporary plan
Easy we come, easy we go
Little we learn, little we know
No place to rest, no space to grow
Easy we come, easy we goEmbed
