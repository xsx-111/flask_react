Save The Whale Lyrics
In turquoise inner space
The giants live with grace
At peace with peace
At peace with god and men

Their spirits rise and fall
Much greater than us all
They trust too much
To see their bitter end
"Never in a million years", they say
"it could never come to this, no way"
You should never trust man, my friends

So as i stare to sea
The salt winds call to me
And as they call
I hang my head in shame
Any other world would call their bluff
But any other world would scream enough
The ocean cries louder to me
Save the whale . . . save the whale . . . save the whale
Save the whale . . . save the whale . . . save the whale

To never kiss and tell
Their factory ship farewell
With every scream
A piece of conscience dies
Lying in a crimson resting place
Crying with a smile upon his face
The giant dies trusting in me
Any other world would call their bluff
But any other world would scream enough
The ocean cries louder to me

Save the whale . . . save the whale . . . save the whale
And Jesus Christ almighty
Save the whale . . . save the whale . . . save the whale
For all our sakes . . . save the whaleEmbed
