Roses LyricsMake it plastic make it pay
Use it up and throw away
Make another just the same, more or less
Burn our time down to size
Send it up into the skies
Hide the evidence with lies, what a mess
But we've just come from a meeting
And we're sure you'd like to know
There'll be deep blue skies and clear blue waters
Everywhere you go
'cos everything's coming up roses
Or so they tell you
Coming up smelling of roses
Or so they say
Yes everything's coming up roses
Or so they tell you
Coming up smelling of roses
Or so they say
In the name of energy
We give our problems to the sea
But they'll be back for you and me
In or haste, we forget
Leaving our mistakes behind
Out of sight is out of mind
Our disposable mankind
What a waste
But we've talked to the experts
And they know a thing or two
They say it's all hunky dory
There's nothing for you to do
'cos everything's coming up roses
Or so they tell you
Coming up smelling of roses
Or so they say
Yes everything's coming up roses
Or so they tell you
Coming up smelling of roses
Or so they say
But it's an awful price to pay
Believing everything they say
Here tomorrow gone today
So take me home to the red red skies and the
Brown, brown grass and the black, black seas
And the broken glass and the dead, dead trees
But everything's coming up roses
Or that's what they tell you
'cos everything's coming up roses
Or so they tell you
Coming up smelling of roses
Or so they say
Yes everything's coming up roses
Or so they tell you
Coming up smelling of roses
Or so they say
'cos everything's coming up rosesEmbed
