City Of Angels LyricsGone fishing for compliments
On hollywood and vine
I'd come to your party
But i haven't finished mine
Talk to the doctor
He turns acid into wine, 'cause
I am an angelin the city of angels
Nothing cuts too deep
Yes i am an angel
In the city of angels
And i live the biggest sleep . . . oh oh oh
I'm off to chew the fat
Where all the in crowd chew
Hang loose at the oscar show
And at the yacht club too
Don't mess with me
'cos i've a bigger hose than you. 'cause
I am an angelin the city of angels
Nothing cuts too deep
Yes i am an angel
In the city of angels
And i live the biggest sleep
Cos i am an angelnothing here is real
Cos i am an angelin the city of angels
It only matters what you feel
Cause
I am an angel
In the city of angels
And everything is cool
Cause i am an angel
In the city of angels
It's me i'm trying to fool
'cos i am an angel
In the city of angels
Nothings as it seems
'cos i am an angel
In the city of angels
So come and live your dreams
'cos i am an angelin the city of angels
Nothing cuts too deep
'cos i am an angel
In the city of angels
And i live the biggest sleepEmbed
