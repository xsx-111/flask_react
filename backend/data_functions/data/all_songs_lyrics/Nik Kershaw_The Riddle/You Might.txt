You Might LyricsOff to face the world again
Past the bathroom mirror
Ignorance is bliss, they say
Couldn't be much clearer
Imaging what might have been
Thinking it could still be
All the lost years in between
Still a sucker for a dream
You might be an oil tycoon
You might be a Cobb cartoon
You might be a Gershwin tune
You might be but you're not
You might be a nations fall
You might be an eagles call
You might be the Albert Hall
You might be but you're not
Play the fool and act the clown
Impress your friends and neighbours
Not so good when you come down
With nothing for your labours
You could've been a movie star
You could've been a hero
You could have won a bridge too far
The best you get is no cigar
You might be an oil tycoon
You might be a Cobb cartoon
You might be a Gershwin tune
You might be but you're not
You are what you are
You see what you see
You might be an oil tycoon
You might be a Cobb cartoon
You might be a Gershwin tune
You might be but you're not
You might be a nations fall
You might be an eagles call
You might be the Albert Hall
You might be but you're notEmbed
