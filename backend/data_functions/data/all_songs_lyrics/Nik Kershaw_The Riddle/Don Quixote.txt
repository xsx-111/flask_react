Don Quixote Lyrics
Your mind can play tricks
Makes you what you want to be
Just like superheroes
You saw them on TV

Coast to coast, wall to wall
Got to go, duty calls
Here I am (Here I am)
Superman, Lois Lane
Saved the world, back again
Here I am

In my old, red saloon
I'm a knight in shining armor
If i were asleep, man
I couldn't be much calmer

Hit the road, on the run
Faster than anyone
Here I am
One for all, all for one
Shake the fist, shoot the gun
Here I am
Don Quixote
What do you say?
Are we proud, are we brave or just crazy?
Don Quixote
What do you say?
Are we shouting at windmills like you?

Common sense, is as good
As a cafe on the moon
When man and machinery come to their high noon

Beat the clock, punch the wall
Fix'd in no time at all
Here I am
Radio on the blink
Kick the cat, hit the drink
Here I am

Don Quixote
What do you say?
Are we proud, are be brave or just crazy?
Don Quixote
What do you say?
Are we shooting at windmills like you?
Here I am
Don Quixote
We're all Men of La ManchaEmbed
