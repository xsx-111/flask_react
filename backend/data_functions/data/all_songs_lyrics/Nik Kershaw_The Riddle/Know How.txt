Know How LyricsGot a badge upon my chest
I'm a cut above the rest
So ican tell you what to do
Got my regimental hat
Got my "by the good book" chat
So ican tell you where to go
I've got a job to do and i'm telling you
I intend to do it well
It's easy when you know how
Got my smart uniform
And my duty to perform
So i
Don't care you who you are
I'm the only one who can spoil your fun
With one shake of the head
It's easy when youknow how, know way
Know where and know today
Know mercy, know time
Know reason, know rhyme
Know how
I can tell you i'm the law
With my medals from the war
So don't tell me what to do
With my narrow point of view
Though i know you're probably right, i guess
It's still not easy saying yes
It's easy when you know how, know way
Know where and know today
Know mercy, know time
Know reason, know rhyme
Know howEmbed
