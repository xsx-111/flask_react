No Way LyricsThere's no way I'm going to let go
There's no way, because it's my show
I'm hanging on for a little while
I won't go down easy, that's not my style
I'm all tied up, tied up in a knot
And I can't decide just what it is I've got
Did I get out of touch? Did I lose my way?
I've not forgot, no, not a single day
Now you might believe I'm not a happy man
Putting myself apart from the common clan
Well, the boat we're sailing, we have a leak or two
But I know it's sound, like me and you
So there's no way I'm going to let go
There's no way, because it's my show
I'm hanging on for a little while
I won't go down easy, that's not my style1Embed
