Sororal Feelings Lyrics
Well, there were four of us in a real small space
Sharing more than just a family name
So many men wanted to walk that line
Oldest to youngest partnered off just fine
Well, I married you I didn't know at the time
I married you without the knowledge that you walked that line

You rolled the dice with
All my sisters before you landed on me
You didn't pay me
You thought that you should get it free
Sororal feelings
Erased from the minute you settled on me
And now I'm gonna hang myself
Hang myself from the family tree

I'll never know, if I was the best
Maybe Mary had you in a real deep sweat
I heard Lucy really gave a ride
You know Sarah with those long thin thighs
You damaged my pride
I'm gonna leave without goodbye
You played the game with
All my sisters before you settled on me
You didn't pay me
You thought that you should get it free
Sororal feelings
They used to come so naturally
And now I'm gonna hang myself
Hang myself from my family tree
Sororal feelings
You know they used to come so naturally
And now I'm gonna hang myself
Hang myself from my family tree..1Embed
