Navy & Cream LyricsSince the beginning of time
People been wonderin'
About the space in between
They've been turning it over
In their minds
Trying to figure out
The end they will meet
Skies of navy & cream
A sweet storm rising up
To take me back to the nest
When I wanna do something
I do it, ride it to the end
I ain't backing down
I'll ride you all, all over town
I'll ride you all over town
"I go to pieces when I feel I'm running," she said
"I go to pieces. I'm running away. I go to pieces feeling distances increasing, yeah. I go to pieces. I feel I'm running away, "she said
It's a skill that's hard to master
One that completely passed
Her up on the road
Skipping generations like
A stone thrown hard
At her window
A break yet unknown
Skies of navy & cream
Sweet storm rising up
To take her back to her mess
Now she wants
A tattoo of a tear drop
On her finger
But it won't fix a thing
Her child is her, her enemy
Her child is her enemy

"I go to pieces. I'm running away. I go to pieces feeling distances increasing, yeah. I go to pieces. I feel I'm running away, "she said1Embed
