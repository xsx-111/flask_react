Window Shades LyricsI won't, I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't, I won't
Think about you every time I hear that tune
I won't, I won't, I won't
Wonder if you think about me, too
I won't, I won't, I won't
Ask all your men how you are doing
I won't, I won't, I won't
Feel no regret pretend I'm glad we met
I won't, I won't, I won't
Call the last number I know works for you
But I've called that number twice
Hoping you'd pick up this time
I haven't spoken with you in a while
Now, baby, I know you know I know
I think about you even so
Silhouettes on the Window Shades in L.A
And you played me
And what if I left it all up to you?
I'd still be waiting
I'm no fool
What if I left it all up to you?
What if I left it all up to you?
What if I left it all up to you?
What if I left it all up to you?
I'm no fool
I'm no fool
But I called that number twice
Hoping you'd pick up this time
I haven't spoken with you for a while
Now, baby, just apologize
Take a moment to recognize:
That's me on the other end still waiting
How could I leave it all up to you?
I'm that fool
How could I leave it all up to you?
I'm that fool
How could I leave it up all up to you?
How could I leave it up all up to you?
How could i leave it up all up to you?
I'm that fool
I'm that fool
How could I leave it up all up to you?
How could I leave it up all up to you?
I'm that foolEmbed
