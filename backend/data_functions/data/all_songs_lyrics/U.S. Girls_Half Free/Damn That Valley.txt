Damn That Valley Lyrics
Damn that Valley
Damn that Valley
Damn that Valley
Where is my man?
Damn that Valley
Damn that Valley
Soldier boy

I will tell if it's completely over
Carry me, I can't go in alone
Soldier stares in the valley below
And that's the valley that took my man from me!
News came when I was all alone
Friendly fire across the telephone
And now there's only one thing I know:
Where is my man?

Damn that Valley
Damn that Valley
Damn that Valley
Soldier boy!
Damn that Valley
Damn that Valley
Damn that Valley
And that valley was low when that mountain was high
I never got to say goodbye
I never thought he was telling me a lie
When he promised me, yeah, he promised me he'd come back alive
Where is my man?

Where is my soldier boy?
Where is my man?
Where is my soldier boy?
Where is my man?

I will tell if it's completely over
Carry me, I can't go in alone
Soldier stares in the valley below
And that's the valley that took my man from me!
News came when I was all alone
Friendly fires across the telephone
And now there's only one thing I know:
Where is my man?
Cause there ain't even bones for me to own
And I can't believe I won't see you no more
And I didn't marry you to be alone
Where is my man?
Damn that Valley
Damn that Valley
Damn that Valley
(Soldier boy)
Damn that Valley
(Oh, soldier boy)
Damn that Valley
(Soldier boy)
Damn that Valley
(Oh, soldier boy)
Damn that Valley
And that's the valley that took my man from me!Embed
