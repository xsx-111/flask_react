Red Comes in Many Shades Lyrics
I can't forget you
When all those things we used to do
Memories don't erase so easily
And lipstick traces on your face proved that to me
When we met, I was young and you were old
Yet it was me who invited you into their home
And once inside, you acted like a child
And, like a mother, when you left all I did was cry

And now it's always raining
My tears fall like rain
My eyes they changed to grey
I am always in the rain

It's been 10 years since last I saw your face
But I can recall it like it was yesterday
There were perfect red lip marks on your neck
You smiled then left

And now it's always raining
My tears fall like rain
My eyes they change to grey
I am always in that rain
And, yes, it's always always raining
And my tears fall down like rain
And my eyes they changed to grey
I am always in that rain
