New Age Thriller Lyrics
When the nighttime falls
(you're left in your disgrace)
You'll heed what I said
(You're left in your disgrace)
Wake up before it's too late
(You're left in your disgrace)
You will succumb to their fate
(You're a disgrace)
It seems you couldn't care less
(You're left in your disgrace)
That you don't own yourself
(You're left in your disgrace)
Why can't you see the wolves have dressed?
(You're left in your disgrace)
You don't, you don't, you don't
You don't own yourself

And I won't provide it for you
Even though you
Even though you'll force me to
I still won't give it to you
And I won't provide it for you
Even though you
Even though you want me to
I learn so much from you
(Don't believe a word they say)
(Don't believe a word they say)
(Don't believe a word they say)
(What--what they say)
And when the breakdown comes
(Don't believe a word they say)
Then you'll hear what I said
(Don't believe a word they say)
You must demand your consent
(Don't believe a word they say)
How can you be so, so, so active in your demise?

And I won't provide it for you
Even though you
Even though you'll force me to
I still only give it to you
And I won't provide it for you
Even though you
Even though you'll force me to
I think it just might finally be the end of the world

You all have nothing here
You have so much to fearEmbed
