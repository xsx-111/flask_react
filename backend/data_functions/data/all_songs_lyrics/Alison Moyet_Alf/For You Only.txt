For You Only LyricsReady to embrace the day as we both break
When the light stole in it found me wide-awake
Wasted from the sleepless night I wished to touch your hair
Withdraw an empty hand for you're no longer there
In between the silence living is an empty space
Save the ticking of the clock whose hands are sweeping past its face
And I just don't want to be lonely -no no
Night and day
But as I look around me I just feel that way
For you only
I turned my hand to something that would clear my head
But I could not forget the parting words we shared
I opened up my mind to all the pictures I could trace
But I could not recall the contours of your face
And always slipped away before I had the chance to say
If I did something wrong please tell I'd accept the blame
I just don't want to be lonely -Night and day
But as I look around me I just feel that way
For you only
For you're no longer there
For you're no longer there
In between the silence living is an empty space
Save the ticking of the clock whose hands are sweeping past its face
I just don't want to be lonely -Night and day
But as I look around me I just feel that way
For you onlyEmbed
