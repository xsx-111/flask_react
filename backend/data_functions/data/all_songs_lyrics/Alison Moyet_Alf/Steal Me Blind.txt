Steal Me Blind LyricsWell my friends I feel it's time
To reassess the situation and decide what's mine
Every time you steal me blind
With no consideration for the way I feel inside
And you just look at me like you don't understand
How could we, how could we let it get so out of hand
Don't steal me blind
You my friends would bleed me dry
And with no hesitation you would pass me by
And you keep telling me that you don't understand
What's the use there's no point in building on sand
Don't steal me blind
Well my friends I feel it's time
There's a fortune in friendshipEmbed
