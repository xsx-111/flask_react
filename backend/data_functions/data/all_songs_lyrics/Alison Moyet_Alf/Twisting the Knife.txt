Twisting the Knife LyricsI watch it trickle from your lips
Pearls of ruby red soaking up your head until you want to push through
And then the world turns red
And the wine tastes sour
Pushing back the hand until the midnight hour
Every door is closing behind you
There's no one left to come and find you
You're soaking wet but the file won't dry you
I'd like to help but I can't stand by
And watch you twisting the knife
They've got you wasting your life
Can't stop you twisting the knife
Id rather turn out all the lights than see you like this
Caress me with your anger
Sting me with your kiss
You've been pushing too hard
I've been trying too long
Now I don't believe I have the will to carry on
You take it one step forward
Then it's two steps back
I'd jump the wire but I'm feeling trapped
Its other people make you insecure
I won't surrender like I did before
And watch you twisting the knife
They've got you wasting your life
Can't stop you twisting the knife
Surrender like I did before
Twisting the knife
Sting me with your kiss
You take it one step forward
Then it's two steps back
I'd jump the wire but I'm feeling trapped
Its other people make you insecure
I won't surrender like I did before
And watch you twisting the knife
They've got you wasting your life
Can't stop you twisting the knifeEmbed
