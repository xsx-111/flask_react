Invisible LyricsYou've got me so confused
And there's words I could use
But I'm afraid to say them
I feel I've been had and I'm boiling mad
Still I can't live without you
You don't have the time
And you won't spend a dime
Not even to call me
Oh, you don't know I exist
And I wouldn't be missed
If I had the nerve to quit you
Invisible
I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance
It ain't going nowhere
Invisible
(Just like your love)
You treat me like I'm invisible
When you get the need to flirt
You do the works
You just don't care how much it hurts
I can never reach you on the phone
It rings and rings when I know you're home
It may be na√Øve, but I just wanna believe
I'm the only one, hey, baby
I tell myself lies and give you alibis
Knowing your promises you'll never keep
Like a merry-go-round
I'm going up, going down
I'm on a dead end street
Invisible
(Just like your love)
I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance
It ain't going nowhere
Although I know it's not a lot
Don't wanna lose what little we got
I keep hanging on knowing I can't win
'Cause it's too hard start over again
Invisible
I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance
It ain't going nowhere
Invisible
(Just like your love)
You treat me like I'm invisible
When you get the need to flirt
You do the works
You just don't care how much it hurts...Embed
