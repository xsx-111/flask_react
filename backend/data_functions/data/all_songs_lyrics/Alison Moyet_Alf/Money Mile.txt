Money Mile LyricsInto your car park drive obsolete motors
With petrol consumption at too higher price
Sell us through windows at backroom board meetings
Blindfolded and handcuffed and in single file
On your money mile
We are the faceless, the nameless, the homeless
On your money mile
There in your fortress where you couldn't care less
On your money mile
We are the caseless, the raceless, the hopeless
On your money mile
You were caught in the crossfire hauling the flag right down
Send us to battle send us to the frontline
Point us at the enemy
Lest we forget
It's for our protection that we lay here slaughtered
It's for our survival we bury our dead
On your money mile
We are the faceless, the nameless, the homeless
On your money mile
There in your fortress where you couldn't care less
On your money mile
We are the caseless, the raceless, the hopeless
On your money mile
You were caught in the crossfire hauling the flag right down
On your money mileâ€¦Embed
