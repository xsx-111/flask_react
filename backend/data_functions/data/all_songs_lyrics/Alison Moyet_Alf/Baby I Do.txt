Baby I Do LyricsYou ask me if I love you
I tell you babe more than anything
Yes it's true
Yes it's true
I do
With the lights down low
I hear you whisper in my ear
I love you
I love you
I do
Through winter, spring, summer, fall
Your love is all I crave
I learn to love you more and more
With every passing day
If only I could give you it all
But then I always do
For you
For you
I do
Through winter, spring, summer, fall
Your love is all I crave
I learn to love you more and more
With every passing day
You ask me if I want you
I tell you babe more than anything
Yes it's true
Yes it's true
Baby I do
Baby I doâ€¦Embed
