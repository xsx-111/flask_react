Honey for the Bees LyricsHey!
Here I am
And I want you to see baby
I wanna watch you watchin me in motion
To taste the secret side of me
Every time I look at you, I know
You're fighting your emotions
Now you have no choice but to let go
And dive into my ocean
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Yeah
Hold my hand
I'm going to set you free baby
I'm gonna let fly all over me
Show me a lock, I'll show you the key
Every time you feel like holding back
I'm gonna pull you deeper
Always straying from the beaten track
And I will be the reaper
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Yeah
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Yeah
Sugar............, Sugar............, Sugar............, Sugar............
Every time I look at you
I know you're fighting your emotions
Now you have no choice but to let go
And dive into my ocean
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Yeah
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
YeahEmbed
