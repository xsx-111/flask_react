All Cried Out Lyrics(Around around around around around
Around around around around around
Around around around around around
Around around around around around)
You took your time to come back this time
The grass has grown under your feet
In your absence I changed my mind
And someone else is sitting in your seat
I know that I said there'd be no one else
I know that I said I'd be true
But baby, I've burned out cupid's arrow
And here's the short and the narrow
I've nothing left to offer you
I'm all cried out
You took a whole lot of loving
For a handful of nothing
(All cried out)
It's hard to give you something
When you're pushing and a-shoving me around
So don't look surprised
There was no disguise
You knew where I stood from the start
So stop
Look around you
You're right back where I found you
Take back your cold and empty heart
(All cried out)
I'm all cried out
You took a whole lot of loving
For a handful of nothing
(All cried out)
It's hard to give you something
When you're pushing and a-shoving
(All cried out)
I'm all cried out
You took a whole lot of loving
(All cried out)
I'm all cried out
It's hard to give you something
When you're pushing and a-shoving me around
(Around around around around around
Around around around around around)
(You go your way)
You go your way
(I'll go mine)
I'll go mine
(I won't stay around here)
I won't stay around here
Don't you waste my time
(Waste my time)
(All cried out)
You took a whole lot of loving
For a handful of nothing
(All cried out)
It's hard to give you something
When you're pushing and a-shoving
(All cried out)
I'm all cried out
You took a whole lot of loving
(All cried out)
I'm all cried out
It's hard to give you something
When you're pushing and a-shoving me around
(Around around around around around
Around around around around around
Around around around around around
Around around around around around)
You go your way
I'll go mine
I won't stay around here
Don't you waste my time
(All cried out
All cried out)
You took a whole lot of loving
For a handful of nothing
(All cried out
All cried out)
You took a whole lot of loving
(Around around around around around)
(All cried out)
You took a whole lot of loving
For a handful of nothing
(Around around around around around)
(All cried out)
It's hard to give you something
When you're pushing and a-shoving
(All cried out
All cried out)
You took a whole lot of loving
(All cried out)Embed
