Any Road Lyrics
Give me, uh, plenty of that guitar

For I've been travelling on a boat and a plane
In a car, on a bike, with a bus and a train
Travelling there, travelling here
Everywhere in every gear

But, oh Lord, we pay the price
With the spin of the wheel, with the roll of the dice
Ah yeah, you pay your fare
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there

And I've been travelling through the dirt and the grime
From the past to the future, through the space and the time
Travelling deep beneath the waves
In watery grottoes and mountainous caves

But, oh Lord, we've got to fight
With the thoughts in the head, with the dark and the light
No use to stop and stare
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
You may not know where you came from
May not know who you are
May not have even wondered
How you got this far

I've been travelling on a wing and a prayer
By the skin of my teeth, by the breadth of a hair
Travelling where the four winds blow
With the sun on my face, in the ice and the snow

But, ooh wee, it's a game
Sometimes you're cool, sometimes you're lame
Ah yeah, it's somewhere
If you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there


But, oh Lord, we pay the price
With the spin of the wheel, with the roll of the dice
Ah yeah, you pay your fare
If you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
I keep travelling around the bend
There was no beginning, there is no end
It wasn't born and never dies
There are no edges, there is no sides

Oh yeah, you just don't win
It's so far out, the way out is in
Bow to God and call him Sir
But if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there

And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
If you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there1Embed
