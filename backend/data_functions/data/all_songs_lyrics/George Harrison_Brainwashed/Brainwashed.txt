Brainwashed Lyrics
Brainwashed in our childhood
Brainwashed by the school
Brainwashed by our teachers
And brainwashed by all their rules
Brainwashed by our leaders
By our kings and queens
Brainwashed in the open
And brainwashed behind the scenes

(God, God, God)
A voice cries in the wilderness
(God, God, God)
It was on the longest night
(God, God, God)
An eternity of darkness
(God, God, God)
Someone turned out the spiritual light

Brainwashed by the Nikkei
And brainwashed by Dow Jones
Brainwashed by the FTSE
Nasdaq and secure loans
Brainwashed us from Brussels
Brainwashing us in Bonn
Brainwashing us in Washington
Westminster, in London
(God, God, God)
You are the wisdom that we seek
(God, God, God)
The lover that we miss
(God, God, God)
Your nature is eternity
(God, God, God)
You are Existence, Knowledge, Bliss

The soul does not love, it is love itself
It does not exist, it is existence itself
It does not know, it is knowledge itself

They brainwashed my great uncle
Brainwashed my cousin Bob
They even got my grandma
When she was working for the mob
Brainwash you while you're sleeping
While in your traffic jam
Brainwash you while you're weeping
While still a baby in your pram
Brainwashed by the military
Brainwashed under duress
Brainwashed by the media
You're brainwashed by the press
Brainwashed by computer
Brainwashed by mobile phones
Brainwashed by the satellite
Brainwashed to the bone
(God, God, God)
Won't You lead us through this mess
(God, God, God)
From the places of concrete
(God, God, God)
Nothing's worse than ignorance
(God, God, God)
I just won't accept defeat
(God, God, God)
Must be something I forgot
(God, God, God)
Down on Bullshit Avenue
(God, God, God)
If we can only stop the rot
(God, God, God)
Wish that you'd brainwash us too
