Never Get Over You Lyrics
I know I'll never get over you
So deep this feeling I have for you
Your eyes pierce through my heart
Your smile tears me apart
I knew it, it's so true
I'll never get over you

You touch me making my heart race
So much was written on your face
I knew when you arrived
That no words could describe
What your love made me do
I'll never get over you

Girl, you're so much heart and soul
Girl, was a moonlit night
You came into my life
And now this feeling has grown
And if you leave me alone I know
I'll never get over you

So hide the moments when I feel blue
You warm the coldest feet
Can cool me in the heat
And although love was new
I'll never get over you
My understanding grew
But I'll never get over
Never get over you
You, youEmbed
