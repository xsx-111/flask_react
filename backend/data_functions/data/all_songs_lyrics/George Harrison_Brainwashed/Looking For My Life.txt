Looking For My Life Lyrics
Oh Lord, won't you listen to me now?
Oh love, I got to get me back to you somehow

I never knew that life was loaded
I'd only hung around birds and bees
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life, looking for my life

Oh boy, you've no idea what I've been through
Oh love, I feel so stuck that I can't get to you

Had no idea that I was heading
Toward a state of emergency
I had no fear where I was treading
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life
Caught up on me with intensity
Had no idea where I was heading
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life, looking for my life
Oh boys, you've no idea what I've been through
Oh love, I got to get back somehow to you

I never knew that life was loaded
I'd only hung around birds and bees
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life
I never got any G.C.E.s
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life, looking for my life
Looking for my life, looking for my lifeEmbed
