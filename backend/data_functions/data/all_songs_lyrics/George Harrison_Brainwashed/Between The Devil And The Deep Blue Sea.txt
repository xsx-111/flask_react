Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea Lyrics
I don't want you but I hate to lose you
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

I forgive you because I can't forget you
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

I want to cross you off my list
But when you come knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

I should hate you but I guess I love you
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea


I want to cross you off my list
But when you come knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you but I guess I love you
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

You got me in between the devil and the deep
(The devil and the deep)
The devil and the deep blue sea2Embed
