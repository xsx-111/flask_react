Pisces Fish Lyrics
Rowers gliding on the river
Canadian geese crap along the bank
Back wheel of my bike begins to quiver
The chain is wrapped around the crank
Old ladies, who must be doggie training
Walking, throwing balls, chasing all the sheep
While the farmer stands around and he's complaining
His mad cows are being put to sleep

I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul

Smoke signals from the brewery
Like someone in there found the latest Pope
In a vat of beer that keeps pumping out with fury
While the church bell ringer's tangled in his rope
But there's a temple on an island
I think of all the Gods and what they feel
You can only find them in the deepest silence
I've got to get off of this big wheel

I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul
I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul
And I'll be swimming until I can find those waters
That's the one unbounded ocean of bliss
That's flowing through your parents, sons and daughters
But still an easy thing for us to miss

Blades go skimming through the water
I hear the coxswain shouting his instructions about
With this crew oh, it could be a tall order
Have we time to sort all these things out?
Sometimes my life it feels like fiction
Some of the days it's really quite serene
I'm a living proof of all life's contradictions
One half's going where the other half's just been

I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul
I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul
I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soulEmbed
