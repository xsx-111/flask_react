Rising Sun Lyrics
On the street of villains taken for a ride
You can have the devil as a guide
And crippled by the boundaries, programmed into guilt
Until your nervous system starts to tilt
And in the room of mirrors you can see for miles
But everything that's there is in disguise
Every word you've uttered and every thought you've had
Is all inside your file, the good and the bad

But in the rising sun
You can feel your life begin
Universe at play inside your DNA
And you're a billion years old today

Oh the rising sun
And the place it's coming from
Is inside of you and now your payment's overdue
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun

On the avenue of sinners I have been employed
Working there until I was near destroyed
I was almost a statistic inside a doctor's case
When I heard the messenger from the inner space
He was sending me a signal that for so long I had ignored
But he held on to my umbilical cord
Until the ghost of memory trapped in my body, mind
Came out of hiding to become alive
And in the rising sun
You can hear your life begin
And it's here and there, nowhere and everywhere
Though its atmosphere is rare

Oh the rising sun
And the place that it's coming from
Is inside of me and now I feel it constantly
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun


But in the rising sun
You can feel your life begin
Universe at play inside your DNA
And you're a billion years old today

Oh the rising sun
And the place it's coming from
Is inside of you and now your payment's overdue
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun1Embed
