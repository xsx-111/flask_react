Rocking Chair In Hawaii Lyrics
I'm going down to the river
Going to take me my rocking chair
Going down to the river
Going to take me my rocking chair
And if those blues don't leave me
Going to rock on away from here

If you want me woman
Please don't act so shy
And if you want me woman
Please don't pass me by
I love those sideways glances
Your shoulder and your thigh

I see inside your eyes
The Baba's Sai
The reasons why I love you

So if you're still busy hiding
What it is you've got?
And if you're frightened of losing
When you like a lot
You may be cruising backwards
While thinking that you're not
I see inside your eyes
The Baba's Sai
The reasons why I love you

So if you don't get the picture
You won't know what I feel
If you don't get the picture
Then you won't have a depth of field
You may be going someplace
Some place you've already beenEmbed
