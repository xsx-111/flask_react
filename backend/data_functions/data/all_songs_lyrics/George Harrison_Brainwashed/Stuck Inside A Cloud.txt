Stuck Inside A Cloud Lyrics
Never slept so little, never smoked so much
Lost my concentration, I could even lose my touch

Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud

Well I made some exhibition, I lost my will to eat
The only thing that matters to me is to touch your lotus feet

Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud
Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud


Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud

Never been so crazy but I've never felt so sure
I wish I had the answer to give, don't even have the cure
Just talking to myself, crying as we part
Knowing as you leave me, I also lose my heart
I'm talking to myself and I'm crying as we part
Knowing as you leave me, I also lose my heartEmbed
