Intension Lyrics
Pure as we begin
Pure as we come in
Pure as we begin
Move by will alone

Pure as we begin
Here we have a stone
Gather, place and raise, so
Shelter turns to home

Pure as we begin
Here we have a stone
Throw to stay the stranger
Swore to crush his bones

Move by will alone

Spark becomes a flame
Flame becomes a fire
Light the way or warm this
Home we occupy
Spark becomes a flame
Flame becomes a fire
Forge a blade to slay the stranger
Take whatever we desire

Move by will alone
Pure as we begin


Pure as we begin
Move by will alone
Leave as we come in
Pure as light, return to one
Move by will alone
Move by will alone1Embed
