Land Lyrics
Away from you
Away from here
Away from here
Stay for me
Stay for me
Stay for me

Baby, I'm really sorry
To break your dream
When it's so early
Headlights
On the windowpane
They're getting lost
In the light of day

Tomorrow is today
And soon my ship will sail

Away from here
To walk a howling sealane
Stay for me
Your love is life, for love is land
Baby, just hear my story
Before I leave
Before we write the end
Standing, across the ocean stream
I'll need to know
I'll need your country then

Tomorrow and today
You keep my landfall safe

Away from here (away from here)
To walk a howling sealane (away from you)
Stay for me (stay for me)
I need your love to land
Away from here (away from here)
To walk a howling sealane (away from you)
Stay for me (stay for me)
Your love is life, for love is land


Away from here (away from here)
To walk a howling sealane (away from you)
Stay for me (stay for me)
I need your love to land
Away from here (away from here)
To walk a howling sealane (away from you)
Stay for me (stay for me)
Your love is life, for love is land
Love is land
Love is land
Love is landEmbed
