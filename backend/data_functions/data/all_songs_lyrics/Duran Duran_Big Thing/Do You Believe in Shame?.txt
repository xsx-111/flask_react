Do You Believe in Shame? LyricsDo you believe in love?
Do you believe in shame?
And if love can conquer all
Then why do we only feel the pain?
I heard you speak my name
Heard you singing The Stones
Maybe heard you laughing in a line of static
On my telephone
So why your eyelids are closed
Inside a case of rust
And did you have to change
All your poet's fire into frozen dust?
I try to justify it
To learn from your mistake
But where's the stupid lie that has to make its point
With such a pointless waste?
Come out
Do you believe in shame?
Do you believe in love?
And if they taste the same
Would you love again or abandon both?
I don't think I ever can
Believe my friend has gone
Keep saying it's alright, I'm going to bring you back
But I know I'm wrong
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing left to do
Just that lately I feel so damn lonely
When I think of you
And it may seem selfish now
But I'll hold on to the memory
Until all this fear is washed away
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in life?
'Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die
'Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die
Yes, I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die
Yes, I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never dieEmbed
