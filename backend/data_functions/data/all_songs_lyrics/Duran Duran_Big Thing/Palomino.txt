Palomino Lyrics
She lays on the wall
Watching the strangers drift away
Mid-day's ore--thick
With the sun of arabia
She surrenders her voices
They gather, on the wind
Talkin, chanting, breathing
Into her body...Yesterday

Awakened beside
The scent of burnt sugar--on the skin
Painting eyes (thick)
With the color she brings in
Oh, and sure and strong
When the lightning tumbles down
Don't you frown
Everything will be
In time for this evening

If there's secrets
She has to be pardoned to
Every one of them
If there's heaven
She gets to the heart
And you'll wonder...
Why she says
When I run out of blue
Help me rise instead
Now I can run to you
Why she says
When I run out of blue
Give me rain instead
Now let me run... (let me run)

If there's secrets
She has to be pardoned to
Every one of them
If there's heaven
She gets to the heart

And you'll know...
Why she says
When I run out of blue
Help me rise instead
Now I can run to you
Why she says
When I run out of blue
Give me rain instead
Now let me run... (let me run)
Hey-hey....
Why she says
When I run out of blue
Help me rise instead
Now I can run to you
Why she says
When I run out of blue
Give me rain instead
Now I can run to you
Why she says
When I run out of blue
Help me rise instead
Now I can run to you
Why she says
When I run out of blue
Give me rain instead
Now I can run to youEmbed
