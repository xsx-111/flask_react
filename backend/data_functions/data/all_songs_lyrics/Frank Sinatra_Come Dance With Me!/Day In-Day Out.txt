Day In-Day Out LyricsDay in-day out
The same old voodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart
Whenever I think of you and darling, I think of you
Day in and day out
Day out-day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain-come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love? Can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in-day out?Embed
