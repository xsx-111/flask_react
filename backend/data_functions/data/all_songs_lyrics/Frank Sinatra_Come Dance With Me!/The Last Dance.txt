The Last Dance LyricsIt's the last dance, we've come to the last dance
They're dimming the lights down, they're hoping we'll go
It's obvious they're aware of us, the pair of us
Alone on the floor
Still I want to hold you like this forever and more
It the last song, they're playing the last song
The orchestra's yawning, they're sleepy I know
They're wondering just when will we leave, but till we leave
Keep holding me tight
Through the last dance, each beat of the last dance
And save me the first dance in your dreams tonightEmbed
