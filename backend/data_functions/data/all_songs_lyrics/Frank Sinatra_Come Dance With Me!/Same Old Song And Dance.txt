Same Old Song And Dance LyricsIt's just the same old song and dance, the same old song and dance
Turns out you never cared at all, turns out you bound me like a ball
Whoever thought I'd fall for the same old song and dance
It's just the same old smooth routine, the same old moonlit scene
Turns out you only used those eyes simply to tell me all those lies
I really went king-size for the same old song and dance
Me with a built-in radar, me with a cushion hard
Winding up number one on the all-time loser's card
I should forget you but I won't, should hate you but I don't
It didn't turn out like I planned but if you smile and wave your hand
I'd go out and hire a band, and wait for one more chance
At the same old song and dance
(instrumental)
It didn't turn out just like I planned
But if you smile and wave your lily white hand
I'd go out and hire a band, then wait for one more chance
At the same old, same old song and danceEmbed
