I Could Have Danced All Night LyricsCould have danced all night, Could have danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings, and done a thousand things
I've never done before
I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when she, began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced, danced, danced all night
I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
And still have danced some more
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
That Ive never done before
I'll never know what made it so, so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when she, began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced, danced, danced all nightEmbed
