What did you expect?
No time (no time, no time at all)
No time for you (no time, no time at all)
I got no time, baby (ahh-ahh)
Got lots of better things to do (no time, no time at all)
Runnin’ from the risin' heat to find a place to hide
The grass is always greener growin' on the other side
No time (no time, no time at all)
Got no time for you (no time, no time at all)
I got no time, baby (ahh-ahh)
Got lots of better things to do (No time, no time at all)
“Rock on, George, for Ringo, one time.”
“There’s just no time.”
No time (no time, no time at all)
No time for you (no time, no time at all)
I got no time, baby (ahh-ahh)
Got lots of better things to do (no time, no time at all)
“Wow!”
No time (no time, no time at all)
No time for you (no time, no time at all)
I got no time, baby (ahh-ahh)
Got lots of better things to do (no time, no time at all)
Try to tell the world somehow of how I feel
Tell me what you said again, I can’t believe it’s real
No time (no time, no time at all)
I got no time for you (no time, no time at all)
I got no time, baby (ahh-ahh)
Got lots of better things to do (no time, no time at all)
Andy, you’re a dandy, you don’t seem to make no sense
Never mind the furthermore, the plea is self-defence
No time (no time, no time at all)
I got no time for you (no time, no time at all)
I got no time, baby (ahh-ahh)
Got lots of better things to do (no time, no time at all)
Wow, I got no time
I got no time
No time for you
I got no time
I got no time
No time, no time, no timeEmbed
