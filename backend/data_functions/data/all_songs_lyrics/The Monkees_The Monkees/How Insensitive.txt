How Insensitive LyricsHow insensitive
I must have seemed when she told me that she loved me
How unnerved and cold
I must have seemed when she told so sincerely
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence?
What was I to do, what can you do
When a love affair is over?
So now she's gone away
And I'm alone with the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still, all the heartache in that last look
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence?
What was I to say, what can you say
When a love affair is over?Embed
