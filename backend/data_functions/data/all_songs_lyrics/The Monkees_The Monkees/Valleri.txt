Valleri Lyrics
Valleri
I love her, Valleri

There's a girl I know who makes me feel so good
And I wouldn't live without her, even if I could

They call her Valleri
I love her, Valleri

Oh, yeah
Come on

She's the same little girl who used to hang around my door
But she sure looks different than the way she looked before

I call her Valleri
I love her, Valleri

Valleri
I love her, Valleri
I love her, Valleri
I need her, ValleriEmbed
