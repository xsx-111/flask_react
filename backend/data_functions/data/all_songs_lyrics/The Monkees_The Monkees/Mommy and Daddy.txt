Mommy and Daddy LyricsAsk your mommy and daddy, “What happened to the Indian?
How come they’re all living in places with too much snow and too much sun?”
Tell your mommy, “I’ve got a funny feeling deep inside of me”
Ask your daddy, “Is it really as bad as people make it seem?”
Wa ta ticka ta too-too
Wa ta ticka ta too-too
Wa ta ticka ta too-too
Wa ta ticka ta too-too
Wa ta ticka ta
Ask your mommy why everybody swallows all those little pills
Ask your daddy, “Why doesn’t that soldier care who he kills?”
After they’ve put you to sleep and tucked you safely down in your bed
Whisper, “Mommy and daddy, would you rather that I heard it from my friends instead?”
Do you think I’m too young to know, to see, to feel, or hear?
My questions need an answer or a vacuum will appear
Don’t be surprised if they turn and walk away
And tell your mommy and daddy that you love ’em anyway, way, way
That you love, you love ’em anyway, uh huh, uh huh
Love, love, love, love the king
Love will set you free
Love, love, love, love the king
