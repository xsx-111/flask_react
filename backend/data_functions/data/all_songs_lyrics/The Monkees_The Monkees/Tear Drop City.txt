Tear Drop City Lyrics
'Bout as low as I've felt in a long time
And I know that I did a wrong at the wrong time
It's plain to see, she's down on me
And I know she'll feel that way for a long time

I was high on top, but I didn't know it
(Tear drop city)
Tell me, why did I have to go and blow it?
(Tear drop city)
I used my lines too many times
And now I've got a badly hurt heart to show it
(Tear drop city)

Took me too long to discover
How much I really love her
How'd I ever end up in this bag?
What a drag

There she goes, looking for a pretty clover
(Tear drop city)
No one knows what it's like 'til it's over
(Tear drop city)
Without a doubt, I just found out
And I suppose I never did get to know her
(Tear drop city)
Oh, tear drop city
Tear drop city

Took me to long to discover
How much I really love her
How'd I ever end up in this bag?
What a drag

'Bout as low as I've felt in a long time
(Tear drop, tear drop city)
I'm 'bout as low as I've felt in a long time
(Tear drop, tear drop city)
I'm 'bout as low as I've felt in a long time
(Tear drop, tear drop city)
I'm 'bout as low as I've felt in a long time...Embed
