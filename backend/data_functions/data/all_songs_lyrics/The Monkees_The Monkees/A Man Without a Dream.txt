A Man Without a Dream LyricsWith the music of life
My soul is out of tune
And I feel like I'm growing old
Much too soon
My love I just couldn't convey
And the key to my happiness
I let slip away
CHORUS:
Now I'm a man without a dream
I've got a heart that has no home
All my senses are numb
Loosing you I've become
A man without a dream
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims
I got distracted with meaningless games
For just an illusion I traded love that was real
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel
CHORUS
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate
Doomed to find out things a little too late
And so I must play this broken man's roll
Unless you come home girl
And bring back my soul
CHORUS
Without a dream...Embed
