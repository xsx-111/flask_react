Take a Giant Step LyricsThough you've played at love and lost
And sorrow's turned your heart to frost
I will melt your heart again
Remember the feeling as a child
When you woke up and morning smiled
It's time you felt like you did then
There's just no percentage in remembering the past
It's time you learned to live again at last
Come with me, leave yesterday behind
And take a giant step outside your mind
You stare at me in disbelief
Say for you there's no relief
But I swear I'll prove you wrong
Don't sit in your lonely room
Just staring back in silent gloom
That's not where you belong
Come with me, I'll take you where the taste of life is green
And every day holds wonders to be seen...
Come with me, leave yesterday behind
And take a giant step outside your mind
Come with me, I'll take you where the taste of life is green
And every day holds wonders to be seen...
Come with me, leave yesterday behind
And take a giant step outside your mindEmbed
