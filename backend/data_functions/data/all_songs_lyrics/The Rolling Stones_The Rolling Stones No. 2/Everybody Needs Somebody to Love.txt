Everybody Needs Somebody to Love Lyrics
I'm so glad to be here tonight and I'm so glad to be home
And I believe I've got a message
For every woman and every man here tonight
That ever needed somebody to love
Someone to stay with them all the time
When they're up and when they're down
You know, sometimes you get what you want
And then you go and lose what you have
And I believe every woman and every man here tonight
Listen to my song and it save the whole world
Listen to me

Everybody wants somebody
Everybody wants somebody to love
Someone to love
Someone to kiss
Sometime to miss, now
Someone to squeeze
Someone to please
And I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you you you
Oh, sometimes I feel like
I feel a little sad inside
My baby mistreats me
And I kind of get a little little mad

I need you you you
To see me through, babe (You, you, you)
When the sun go down (You, you, you)
Ain't nobody else around (You, you, you)
That's when I need you baby
That's when I say I love you
That's when I say I love you
Let me hear you say yeah
Let me hear you say yeah
Let me hear you say yeah
Let me hear you say yeah
I need you you you you
Somebody to see me through, baby
I need you you you

When the sun goes down
Ain’t nobody else around
That's when I'm all by myself
That's when I need your loving darling
That's when I need it so bad
You're the one I really need bad

To see me through baby
In the morning time too
When the sun goes down
And ain’t nobody else around
