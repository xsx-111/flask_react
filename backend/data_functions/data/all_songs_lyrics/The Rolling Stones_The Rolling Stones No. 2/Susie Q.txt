Susie Q Lyrics
Oh, Susie Q
Oh, Susie Q
Oh, Susie Q, I love you
My Susie Q

I love the way you walk
I love the way you talk
I love the way you walk, I love the way you talk
My Susie Q


Say that you'll be true
Say that you'll be true
Say that you'll be true and never leave me blue
My Susie Q

Oh, Susie Q
Oh, Susie Q
Oh, Susie Q, honey I love you
My Susie QEmbed
