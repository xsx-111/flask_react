O, Lilac LyricsLilac, I wish you were my little Lilac
O Lilac
I trust you can't remember most so rest your head now
Your head now
Lilac, I feel your last lies come straight from her eyes
To my eyes
Tonight, should you rise above, I regret love
I regret love
And you have ghost hands on, that can't hold you up
And you have ghost hands on, I can't hold you up
I gotta let you live
I gotta let you
I gotta let you live
I gotta let you
Lilac, I wish you were my little Lilac
My Lilac
I trust you can't remember most so rest your head now
Your head now
And you have ghost hands on that can't hold you up
And you have ghost hands on I can't hold you up
I can't hold you upEmbed
