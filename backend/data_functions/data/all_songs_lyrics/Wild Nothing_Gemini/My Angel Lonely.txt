My Angel Lonely LyricsCalming down with my head in the sand
Come away, come away
To begin, let's get closer
Doesn't he love me?
Just sit by the withered trees
Resting my knees
Because I'm losing comfort
Doesn't it feel right?
Mystical
When you're blowing your hair in the perfect waves
You're trying your best just to push me away
I can't ever tell since you were never there to begin
My angel in loneliness
My angel lonely
My angel in loneliness
My angel lonely
Passing by, I should have known
Let me slip into the tomb
White glow
Step in the white glow
Make me, make me
Grin and blush
Shining eyes are watching
Us too
And I'm assuming they are
Mystical
When you're blowing your hair in the perfect waves
You're trying your best just to push me away
I can't ever tell since you were never there to begin
My angel in loneliness
My angel lonely
My angel in loneliness
My angel lonelyEmbed
