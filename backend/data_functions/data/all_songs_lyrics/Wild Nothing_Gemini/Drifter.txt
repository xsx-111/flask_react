Drifter Lyrics

Touch my face, wipe my cheek
Talk to her, go to sleep
Dream of nothing, wake up tired
Talk to no one, not today

I feel like drifting now
I’m going to drift into your eye


Touch my face, wipe my cheek
Talk to her, go to sleep
Dream of nothing, wake up tired
Talk to no one, not today

I feel like drifting now
I’m going to drift into your eye
