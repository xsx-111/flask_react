Gemini Lyrics
You don't know, I've got nothing to say anymore
It's a shame I know, we're both perfectly in loathe
Lets not say you never give me anything
I don't care, I was what I was right there

Do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted twin soul for you
I've got a palm I'm reaching for you
Do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted twin soul for you
I've got a palm I'm reaching for you

In your eyes, I've got nothing to see anymore
To convince me enough to compromise my heart
Let's not say its just a game again
Cause we both know we're both perfectly in loathe

Do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted twin soul for you
I've got a palm I'm reaching for you
Do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted soul for you
I've got a palm I'm reaching for youEmbed
