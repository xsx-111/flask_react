Chinatown Lyrics
Innocent love
I need someone somewhere
I need somewhere to come down
I need some way to make you smile
Innocent love
I need someone somewhere
I need somewhere to come down
I need some way to make you smile

We're not happy 'til we're running away
Clouds in your eyes
With nothing but the foggiest day

One of a kind
I need to keep you here
I need to picture you still
I need to clear the fog
One of a kind
I need to keep you here
I need to picture you still
I need to clear the fog

We're not happy 'til we're running away
Clouds in your eyes
With nothing but the foggiest day
Clouds in your eyes
We're not happy 'til we're running away
Clouds in your eyes
With nothing but the foggiest day8Embed
