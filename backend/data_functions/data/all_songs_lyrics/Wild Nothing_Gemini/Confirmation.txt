Confirmation LyricsI know it's calling your bluff
What a beautiful confirmation
That I'm in the dark
Where I've always been
Why must we be so rough?
Is it the thing in the promise that keeps us?
Do you know what you want?
Fuck being perfect
Dream and love
Never wake up
Dream and love
Never wake up
I know it's calling your bluff
What a beautiful confirmation
That I'm in the dark
Where I've always been
Why must we be so rough?
Is it the thing in the promise that keeps us?
Do you know what you want?
Fuck being perfect
Dream and love
Never wake up
Dream and love
Never wake up1Embed
