Bored Games LyricsWhere are you going?
Can I come with you?
I don't feel right when you're not here
Where are you going
Can I come with you?
It just don't feel right when you're not here
I know you're bad
That's why I like you
That's why I like you
Where are you going?
Can I come with you?
I don't feel right when you're not here
Where are you going?
Can I come with you?
It just don't feel right when you're not here
I know you're bad
That's why I like you
That's why I like you
I know you're bad
That's why I like you
That's why I like you2Embed
