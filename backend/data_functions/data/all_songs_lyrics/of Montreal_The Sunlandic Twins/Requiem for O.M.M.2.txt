Requiem for O.M.M.2 Lyrics
When I met you I was just a kid
Hadn't built up my defenses
So I gave my heart completely
Vaseline over the lenses

Memories dont go away
I remember every day
I never ever stop wondering
Wondering if you still think of us
I dont need a photograph
Cause you've never left my mind
No you've never left my mind

I remember feeling like a ship
Whose captain was too drunk to steer
And you watched as I was sinking
Waving sadly from the pier

Memories dont go away
I remember every day
I never ever stop wondering
Wondering if you still think of us
I don't need a photograph
'Cause you've never left my mind
No you've never left my mind
Its such a burden to carry 'round
The vestiges of dead dreams
And I dont want to make a wake out of my life
I just had to let you goEmbed
