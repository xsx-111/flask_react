Art Snob Solutions LyricsWhat's up directors? Grab your knives
It's time to take all, all of the lives
Of the people who cannot see
The somnolent genius of Tarkovsky
Come on authors, grab your guns!
It's time to murder everyone
Who's never heard of Apollinaire
Send them all to hell, it's only fair
Cast them all into the flames if they don't know any names
Of the principals of Arte Povera
Or unfamiliar with Le Serpent Mascara
(That's right, mascara snake!)
Come on painters, alive or dead
Give all the cretins a boot to the head
If they don't extol convincingly
Tempered Elan-era Kandinsky
Throw them all into a well
If they cannot tell
An Arto Parv feast of repetition
From a Schoenberg 12-tone composition
Come on artists, the day is here
And your mission is very clear
Put an end to the bourgeoisie
And death to everyone who's never heard of meEmbed
