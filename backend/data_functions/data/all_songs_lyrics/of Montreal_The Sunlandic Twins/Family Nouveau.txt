Family Nouveau LyricsIt's crazy to think
How I was living like a prisoner
But now I am free
Not tied to a past I never wanted anyway
Life before I met you
Was just a bunch of yesterdays
But now I worry I've invested too much
Because when you're away from me
Everything just gets so ugly
Giving you my heart was not a mistake - I don't regret it
And though it shook up my friends
I hope that they know that I still love them all the same
I just had to move on
And start my grown-up life with you
You and me and our little Alabee
My god, it happened to me
I really have my own familyEmbed
