Oslo in the Summertime Lyrics
Oslo in the summertime
Nobody can fall asleep
Staring out the window from my bed
At 4 A.M., the sun is up
Look, the sky is peppered with sea birds
And with crows all cackling

Up in treten Heimdalsgate, me and Nina making fun
Of footballers in Rudolf Nilsen Plass
I practice my Norwegian on poor befuddled waitresses
Who shake their heads completely at a loss
Oslo in the summertime
The streets are strangely quiet
Cause everyone's away on holiday

Oslo in the summertime
Pakistani children play
Locked inside of the courtyard all day
Pretty people everywhere
Sun-lamp tans and flaxen hair
Just tell the American not to stareEmbed
