Everyday Feels Like Sunday LyricsEveryday feels like Sunday baby everyday feels so good
Everyday feels like Sunday baby everyday feels so good
I'm further and further away from the fall everyday
And for years I bowed I could not sleep so very well
Even standing up I crawled yet there is a softness I can tell
I'm electric now from the pure brilliant sparks you shot
Like a little man all I can say is â€thanks a lotâ€
Ah I must destroy this artificial darkness
That's how it seems to me to be, art artificial now 'causeEmbed
