Tears Lyrics
Tears, all night long
That's ok, I'm not strong
I'm not strong enough, to live without her

When will my baby see, how much she means to me?
When will my baby know, how much I love her?
I'm not strong enough, to live without her
Whoa
Whoa
Oh

Tears, all night long
That's ok, I'm not strong
I'm not strong enough, to live without her

When will my baby see, how much she means to me?
When will my baby know, how much I love her?
I'm not strong enough, to live without her
Whoa
Whoa
OhEmbed
