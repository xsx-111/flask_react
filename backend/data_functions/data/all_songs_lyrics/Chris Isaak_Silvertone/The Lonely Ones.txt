The Lonely Ones Lyrics
If you drive late at night, and pass the town at night
And know that someone lies awake not sleeping
If you drive fast at night, and hear the wind at night
And know tha sometimes you can hear them weeping
The lonely ones

The lonely ones

And though you'd like to stop, you know it's wrong to stop
The nights' to dark for you to ever reach them, the lonely ones

The lonely ones

As you drive on we drive faster
You try to leave the night behind you but wait...
You hear them still
You always will

The lonely ones
Out on the edge of town, you start to turn around
But in your mirror you see the one who is crying, the lonely ones

The lonely ones
The lone-ly ones!
