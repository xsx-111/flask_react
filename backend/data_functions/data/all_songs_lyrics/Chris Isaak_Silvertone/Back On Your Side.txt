Back On Your Side Lyrics
You can talk about true love, saay we're through
And I do my best pretending I don't love you
But when they put you down, they're always surprised
'Cause' then I'm

Back on your side
Back on your side
Back on your side, baby I'm
I'm back on your side

And it was friends who told me stories from the start
But I'm not listening now, I'm listening to my heart
And no one blames you, if you really don't believe
But baby I'm

Back on your side
Back on your side
Back on your side, baby I'm
I'm back on your side

You know I've always loved you and I love you still
You know I've always loved you and I always will
Darlin' I'm
Back on your side
Back on your side
Back on your side, baby I'm
I'm back on your side

I'm back, back on your side
Darling I'm back, back on your side
Back on your side
Back on your side
Back on your side
