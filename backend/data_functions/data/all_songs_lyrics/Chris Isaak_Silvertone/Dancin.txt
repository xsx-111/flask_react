Dancin Lyrics
I keep on dancin', dancin'
Nothing left to say, nothing left to do
I find myself alone and thinking just of you
You got me dancin', dancin'

Why don't you help me?
Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise
To stand beside me?


There was a man in a foreign land
In love with a woman he didn't understand
Love is not a thing you command
Love is something that keeps you, keeps you
Dancin', dancin'

Why don't you help me?
Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise
To stand beside me?

I keep on dancin', dancin'
Nothing left to say, nothing left to do
Find myself alone and thinking just of you
You've got me dancin', dancin'

Why don't you help me?
Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise
To stand beside me?

Dancin' dancin' dancin'
You've got me
Oh, help me, guide me
Why don't you promise you'll stand beside me
Help me
