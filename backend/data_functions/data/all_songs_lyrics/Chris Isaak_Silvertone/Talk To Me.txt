Talk To Me Lyrics
Talk to me, tell me that you love me, and that you'll never leave me
Talk to me, tell me that you love me, and that you'll never leave me
Talk to me, tell me that you love me, and that you'll never leave me
Talk to me, tell me that you love me, and that you'll never leave me

Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me like you're the only girl
Talk to me in this whole wide world
Talk to me like your're the only one
Talk to me tell me what has love done

Imagine a boy
Imagine a girl
Imagine the hearts
That are broken by the world

Don't pass me by like a stranger
Don't shackle love, there's no danger
Don't leave me here
All alone, oh

Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk
Talk
Talk to me, tell me that you love me, and that you'll never leave me
Talk to me, tell me that you love me, and that you'll never leave me
Talk to me, tell me that you love me, and that you'll never leave me
Talk to me, tell me that you love me, and that you'll never leave me

Don't pass me by like a stranger
Don't shackle love, there's no danger
Don't leave me here
All alone
So alone
I'm alone, oh

Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk
Talk

Imagine a boy
Imagine a girl
Imagine the hearts
That are broken by the world
Talk
Talk
Talk
Talk
Talk to me
Darlin' talk to meEmbed
