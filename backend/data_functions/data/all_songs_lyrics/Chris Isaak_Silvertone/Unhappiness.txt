Unhappiness Lyrics
I know I should try, and I do
I know that I can't win
But I try for you, sometimes I pretend
I've found my happiness

Dark is day, and the night is blue
But darling that's alright
Cause' I know without you, I'd be left alone
With my unhappiness

If you think your alone, if you think that it's wrong that you've only died inside
Always lonely, always lonely
If you think that it's true, that your love ain't blue, that there's nothing to do but cry
Then your lonely, always lonely

Don't know why I cry, but I do
I worry over you
And I know someday, that when this love is through
I'll find unhappiness

When I'm through, I'll find unhappiness
When I'm through, I'll find unhappinessEmbed
