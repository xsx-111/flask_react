Western Stars Lyrics
Western stars light up the sky, hear the desert wind roll by
Tonight, tonight
Western stars can break your heart, they keep shining when we're apart
Tonight, tonight

I'll watch, I'll wait, how will my heart ache tonight?
Tonight
I'll watch, I'll wait, my heart is bound to break tonight

Western stars light up the sky, tonight I'm alone to cry
Tonight, like every night
A western hero must play his part, even though it will break his heart
Tonight, oh tonight

I'll watch, I'll wait, how will my heart ache tonight?
Tonight
Western stars light up the sky, hear the desert wind roll by
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, to-nightEmbed
