Voodoo Lyrics
I know what to do when your sad and lonely
I know what to do when you love her only
I know what to do when no one needs you
I know what to do you do voodoo Voodoo
You do voodoo

I know what to do when the world decieves you
I know what to do when no one needs you
I know what to do when your whole heart breathes you
I know what to do when your lover leaves you Voodoo
You do voodoo

Dance in a ring of flames, shadows fall the same, fire, love and pain
Do voodoo, voodoo, voodoo

I know what to do when your sad and lonely
I know what to do when you love her only
I know what to do when no one needs you
I know what to do you do voodoo
I know what to do you do voodoo, voodoo
You do voodoo, you do voodoo, you do voodooEmbed
