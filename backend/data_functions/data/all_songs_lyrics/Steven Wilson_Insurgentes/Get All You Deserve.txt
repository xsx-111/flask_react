Get All You Deserve LyricsOpen the car door slow
Don't think you'll ever know my name
Get all that you deserve, in this world
Love more than you can know
Have more than you'll ever need from me
Get all that you deserve, in this world
Get all that you deserve
Get all that you deserve
Get all that you deserveEmbed
