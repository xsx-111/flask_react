Insurgentes LyricsHoly Mother of the simple one
When you smile at me you bring me down
You betray your thoughts
All your prayers too low
Now out of debt, you speak in tongues
And out of breath, your work is done
And your dream, absolve
And your path, dissolve
And your dream, absolve
And your path, dissolveEmbed
