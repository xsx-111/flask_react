Insurgentes (Mexico) Lyrics
Holy Mother of the simple one
You can smile at me and bring me down
You betray your thoughts
All your prayers to naught
And out of breath you speak in tongues
And out of death, your work is done
And your dream absolves
And your path dissolves
When your cradle rocks, her love comes down
All the pretty lies you (prance?) around
And your dream absolves
And your path dissolvesEmbed
