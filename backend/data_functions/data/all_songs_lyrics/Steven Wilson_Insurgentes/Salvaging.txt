Salvaging LyricsWhat was the point
Of making you trust
Living a lie
It's a pain in the dust
God always shouts
And you always kick
Through passionless eyes
Yeah, you make me feel sick
A secret is told
But the body rejected
A smile is a question
But the end is expected
A truce is attained
Excuses are given
Time to assess
Now the nails can be driven
Time to assess
Now the nails can be driven
Time to assess
Now the nails can be drivenEmbed
