Significant Other LyricsPullin’ back from the precipice
Feel so small now, stars shine bright above
Don’t know why
Receive a better life for a soul
Can’t but try, other leads apply
Lookin’ up at tragic rush on underground
Birds will turn and fly
Don’t know why
Passin’ through the day, only child
Breathe a sigh, other leads apply
Raining all day
Trying to reach you
Feel so helpless
Can’t stop counting time (And in the morning when I wake up)
Don’t know why, pain upon the steel in my heart (Roses)
Grey smoke dies, other leads apply (Rain down from)
(the sky)1Embed
