Puncture Wound Lyrics
Streets, like Prussian blues
Split the cells in my blood
Black like the outer eye
Adrenaline by love
The glow of a cigarette
Illuminates from above
Push, push down the earth
Feel my hand through your glove
Slump in the other door
Skin belongs to both
Point in perfect form
A puncture wound resultsEmbed
