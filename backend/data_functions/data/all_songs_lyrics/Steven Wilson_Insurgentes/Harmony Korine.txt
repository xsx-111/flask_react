Harmony Korine Lyrics
Rain, come down, and fall forever
Drain, the dirt, into the wasteland
Pray, for sound, to quiet the howling

Feel, no shame, too brave
Feel, afraid, to wait forever

Kneel, to fade, the day's corrosion
Crawl, depart, towards perdition
Gray, the part, the bruise within you

Feel, no shame, too brave
Feel, afraid, to wait forever

Forever

Feel, no shame, too brave
Feel, afraid, to wait foreverEmbed
