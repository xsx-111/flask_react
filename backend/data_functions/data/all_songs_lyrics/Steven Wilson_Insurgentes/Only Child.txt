Only Child LyricsA raven holding to narrow wrist*
Pull it tight
Clothes are torn and the body twists
A single light
The worse the struggle the more you fail
Strands fall down
The more you like it the more it hurts
Why stop now?
An only child
A winning smile
A killing trial
A broken rib and a bloody lip
All in hell*
The fireâ€™s gone and your pride is stripped
A private hell***
You never know why it is** this way
Leave here now
Live through this on another day*
Tonight sleep sound
An only child
A winning smile
A killing trialEmbed
