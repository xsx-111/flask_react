Winners and Losers LyricsThere are winners, there are losers
Now I'm wonderin' which one am I
There are leaders, there are followers
Am I a leader? Would you follow me?
Spend all my time tryin' to find
Answers to questions that are haunting me
And like all men who are trying to see
I'm still fighting, fighting to be free
I've known lovers, I've known loners
I got to know before I die Lord, which one am I
There are rich men, there are poor men
I've been both, I tell ya both times I've cried
Spend all my time tryin' to find
Answers to questions that are haunting me
And like all men who are trying to see
I'm still fighting, fighting to be free
There are winners, there are losers
Just now I'm wonderin' which one am I
There are leaders, there are followers
Am I a leader? Would you follow me?
There are bad men, there are good men
But all men are tryin' to be free
Spend all my time tryin' to find
Answers to questions that are haunting me
And like all men who are trying to see
I'm still fighting, fighting to be free
Spend all my time tryin' to find
Answers to questions that are haunting me
And like all men who are trying to see
I'm still fighting, fighting to be freeEmbed
