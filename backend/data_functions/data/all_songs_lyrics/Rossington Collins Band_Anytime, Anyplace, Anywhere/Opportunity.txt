Opportunity LyricsThere've been times when I
Have stumbled over my mistakes
And there've been times when I
Have fallen flat on my face
But you tell me there's never been
A day like that for you
Then I'll stop and listen
To what you think I should do
Now I can take this pressure
That you think you're handing down
But take off the robe
And put the gavel down
'Cause nothing changes in this life
But everything, my friend
Don't go cryin' 'bout today
Because of what has been
Opportunity is for the taking
Look inside yourself, you'll see
Then go clean up your own backyard
Leave my yard to me
Now, if the cup had
Really not been meant to pass to me
Surely I would not presume to drink
But there they are
And they're reaching out for me
What else would you have me to think
Opportunity is for the taking
Look inside yourself, you'll see
Then go clean up your own backyard
Leave my yard to me
There've been times when I
Have stumbled over my mistakes
And there've been times when I
Have fallen flat on my face
But you tell me there's never been
A day like that for you
Then I'll stop and listen
To what you think I should do
Opportunity is for the taking
Look inside yourself, you'll see
Then go clean up your own backyard
Leave my yard to meEmbed
