Prime Time LyricsWell it's prime time
You got to shake off those work day blues
Said it's prime time
You better put on your dancin' shoes
'Cause they're alive and well and ready
Are you ready for the big, big boys
We're alive and well and ready
Are you ready for the real McCoy
I said are you ready
Well it's gonna be a good time
How I love when the sun goes down
And it's the best time -- oh yes it is
Hey I got the best news around
Said they're alive and well and ready
Are you ready for the big, big boys
We're alive and well and ready
Are you ready for the real McCoy
Oh I'm talkin' about the big boys
Are you ready for the real McCoy, oh yes
It's been a long, long time
But we still know the games you're playin'
And now it's prime time yeah
Hey, hey I think you know what I'm sayin'
Said we're alive and well and ready
Are you ready for the big, big boys
We're alive and well and ready
Are you ready for the real McCoy
Oh I'm talkin' about the big boys
Well I'm here to tell you
They are alive and well
And I believe we are ready
Are you ready for the real McCoy
Are you ready for the big boys
Are you ready, yeahEmbed
