One Good Man LyricsDo you remember the city of Sodom?
There was wickedness throughout the land
Well the Lord said, "Lot, hey brother we got trouble
Go to your city and find me one good man"
Aw can you find me one good man?
All I need is one good man
Well we know what happened when Lot returned alone
He said, "I'm sorry Lord but I could not find one"
Well the Lord said "You ain't worthy of salvation, no!"
And He raised His mighty hand
And He destroyed them all
'Cause He could not find one good man
Not in all the land, there wasn't one good man
Aw can you find me, can you find me one good man?
All I need is one good man
I have seen children go hungry
For the lack of their daddy's smile
I've seen those children grow up bitter
'Cause they never had the love of one good man
I have seen women lose all their pride
Trying to please one selfish man
I have seen women lose their very soul
Searchin', searchin' for one good man
Aw can you find me one good man?
All I need is one good man
Aw can you find me one good man?
All it takes is one good manEmbed
