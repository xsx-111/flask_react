Sometimes You Can Put It Out LyricsSometimes you can put it out, but it just don't do no good
Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you knock on wood
But ain't it good to walk out on a limb and find that it holds
I plan on climbin' high instead of growing old
Sometimes I wake up feelin' I could conquer anything
Sometimes I wake up feelin' like I'm hangin' by a string
Aw but stretch that tightwire over the city
I know that walk is dangerous but the view is so pretty
Why should I worry what happens tomorrow
You know tomorrow -- it just might not come
I'll take my chances on livin' my life today
Sometimes you can put it out and it don't do you no good
Experience is the teacher, but it's a hell of a way to learn
Still you've got to feed the fire and hope you don't get burned
Aw, now don't you fool yourself you gotta pay the price
You gotta take some chances if you want to bring home the prize
Why should I worry what happens tomorrow
You know tomorrow -- it just might not come
I'll take my chances on livin' my life today
Sometimes you can put it out and it don't do you no good
Well now I've put my fingers in the pie, just pulled out my thumb
But I know how sweet the meat is of that juicy plum
Well I'm just the kind that can't help reachin' for the moon
If I only get half-way, I guess that's okay too
Sometimes you can put it out, but it just don't do no good
Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you knock on wood
But ain't it good to walk out on a limb and find that it holds
I plan on climbin' high instead of growing old
Why should I worry what happens tomorrow
You know tomorrow -- it just might not come
I'll take my chances on livin' my life today
Sometimes you can put it out and it don't do you no goodEmbed
