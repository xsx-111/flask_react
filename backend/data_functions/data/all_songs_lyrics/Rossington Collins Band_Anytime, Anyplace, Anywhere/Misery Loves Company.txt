Misery Loves Company LyricsSeems that I've been cheated, I know I've been deceived
By a man I called my lover and a lady I called friend
Mmm, and now I'm feelin' down right lonely boy
I sure could use a friend
Misery loves company, I'm in misery tonight
Misery loves company, I need a friend tonight
Well, it's true I don't know you well
And I know I should not intrude
But you're looking more than sad yourself
Or could it be your heart is breaking
They say misery loves company, I'm in misery tonight
Misery loves company, I need your hand tonight
Oh reach out and help me boy
Well, it's true I don't know you well
And I know I should not intrude
But you're looking more than sad yourself
Or could it be your heart is breaking
They say misery loves company, I'm in misery tonight
Misery loves company, would you stay the night
Would you stay with me
Oh would you stay with me boyEmbed
