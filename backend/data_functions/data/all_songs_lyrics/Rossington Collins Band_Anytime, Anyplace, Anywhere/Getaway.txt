Getaway LyricsI'm feeling the strain of getting nowhere again
Of living my life in the fast lane
And I'm feeling so tired, dreaming in vain
And watching my hopes in flames
I got to get away
I got to get away from the madness, yeah
I got to get away
I got to get away by myself
I got to get away from the takers and the soap opera scenes
Now I got to get away from the fakers who try so hard to please
Get away from the city life and all the charade
Now I got to get away from the busy life and all the masquerade
Get away, I got to get away from here
In the darkest of hours when the world is asleep
I lay here and wonder what's in store for me
'Cause you say that you want me and then you say that you don't
Today I believe you need me, probably tomorrow I think you won't
I got to get away
I got to get away from the madness, yeah
I just got to get away
I got to get away by myself
I got to get away from the takers and the soap opera scenes
I got to get away from the fakers who try too hard to please
Get away from the city life and all the charade
Now I got to get away from the busy life and all the masquerade
Get away, I got to get away from here
Come this time tomorrow I'll be far from here
I'm gonna find me a mountain, gonna breathe the air
I'm gonna shake off the sorrow, gonna shake off the gloom
I'm gonna leave behind the sadness, I'm gonna be better soon
But now I got to get away
I got to get away from the madness and lies
I got to get away
I got to get away by myself, ooh
I got to get away from the takers and the soap opera scenes
I got to get away from the fakers who try too hard to please
Get away from the city life and all the charade
Now I got to get away from the busy life and all the masquerade
Get away, I got to get away from hereEmbed
