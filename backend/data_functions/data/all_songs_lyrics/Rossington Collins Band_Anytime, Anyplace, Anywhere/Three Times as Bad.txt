Three Times as Bad LyricsMan says he loves his woman
But he finds himself in the streets alone
Pretty young thing turn his head
Mmm, while his woman is at home
He goes out and plays a new game
Aw, but he's feelin' so bad
He's feelin' so ashamed
But you know boy, before it's over
It's gonna hurt three times as bad
Oh yes it is
Three times as bad
It's gonna hurt you three times as bad
Before this whole thing is over
It's gonna hurt you three times as bad
Now hisa woman, it nearly broke her heart
To find that her man had been strayin'
And it's a bad, bad seed she sowin' now
It's jealousy and it keeps on, keeps on growin'
So she goes out and plays his game
Aw, but now she feelin' twice as bad
She's feelin' so ashamed
But you know, before it's over girl
Oh it's gonna hurt you three times as bad
Oh yes it will
Three times as bad
It's gonna hurt you three times as bad
Before this whole thing is over
It's gonna hurt you three times as bad
Well they're still together you know
They're together, but they are so far, far apart
You know they don't like themselves much no more
And they broke each others hearts
Now they've played their games
And they're feelin' so bad
They're still feelin' the pain
Now the whole damn thing is over
And it's hurtin' three time as bad
Yes it is
Three times as bad
It's gonna hurt you three times as bad
Before this whole thing is over
It's gonna hurt you three times as badEmbed
