I Will Ask You Twice LyricsI'm playing footsie with Jesus
Man what a weak touch
I don't read the Bible, baby
I think it says don't ask much
With good posture for peace
A celebration would be nice
Would you marry me baby?
I will ask you twice
Leather boots for justice
Ones that fit just right
What size are you when wet?
Do you wear those things out at night?
With good posture for peace
A celebration would be nice
Will you marry me baby?
I will ask you twice
I will ask you twiceEmbed
