A Choir Apart LyricsHeads up for this joker
Hand on the heart
Pledge to a false flag
Shout from the Sundays
Hallelujahs condescending
The joy was showing
Praise in one ear
And out the other
You'd curse your own name
You'd curse your brother
How can a man sing
With the choir apart
My lips were moving
No soul or heart
Gifts of wine for me
A pass of hands for thee
Late on arrival
I wrote your name in a book
Traded in papers
I asked them all
Longing for someone to add my own name
Pens of fountain ink, written in feather
Acrylic on leather, birds claw untethered
My word is divine, I control the weather
Forget the long season
My path transcribed
The long handshake
Whisper from the midday
Perspective hushed
Tasking just for tips
Golden sings that have been sung
Wise ass wisdom, wasted on the young
Spend your mornings thinking about the night
Don't carry fire, you can use my lightEmbed
