Funny Thing She Said LyricsFunny thing she said to me
I could see you giving me a child
But your roaming eye
You're going to give them what is mine
How you come with the day
And you leave with the night
Your lips taste like honey
But I know you're drinking wine
And I'm no easy meadow
There is no water to drink
And hey why the long face boy
Have you even thought of me
Funny thing she said to me
Why'd you even come over last night
You're chiming in the wrong shade of blue
Saturday night meant nothing, but I know that Sunday was true
How you come with the day
And you leave with the night
Your lips taste like honey
But I know you're drinking wine
And I'm no easy meadow
There is no water to drink
And hey why the long face boy
Have you even thought of meEmbed
