Sullen Mind LyricsI'm cast in a corner bar and you'd tell me
Naked ladies in the sunlight, they adore me
And I can only turn to walk away, because I only have a Christian education
And with a sullen mind, I carry you
And with a sullen mind, I'm fair
And with a sullen mind, I laid down
And with a sullen mind, I'm out of here
I'm cast in a corner bar and you'd tell me
I can take any motherfucker home who loves me
And I can only turn to walk away, because I only have a Christian education
And with a sullen mind, I carry you
And with a sullen mind, I'm there
And with a sullen mind, I laid down
And with a sullen mind, I'm out of here
I’m cast in a corner bar and you’d tell me
That I can go out any night with no money
And I can only turn to walk away, because I only have a Christian education
And with a sullen mind, I carry you
And with a sullen mind, I'm fair
And with a sullen mind, I laid down
And with a sullen mind, I'm out of here
Seventeen past three, and I’m waiting on a friend
He owes me cigarrettes, and I owe him gasoline
Half past four, and the speed is kicking in
Honey, come on over and I’ll show you where I begin
And with a sullen mind, I carry you
And with a sullen mind, I'm there
And with a sullen mind, I laid down
And with a sullen mind, I'm out of hereEmbed
