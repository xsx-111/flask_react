The Halfwit In Me LyricsI kept your word
In place of mind
Divine rights
Of the godless implied
And the halfwit in me couldn't keep time
A tuneless trumpet
Breaks down the stone
Weight of the keep and take
Contracted by loan
And the halfwit in me stayed out all night
Go on ahead
Build another home
For lean mean eaters
Everything but the bone
Call yourself lucky, we never use the phone
Borrow headspace
From tomorrow and on
Everybody has papers
If they're in on the con
And the halfwit in me kept on keeping on
A Sunday sit down
We still end up short
A life to confess
We still pay less
And the halfwit in me will have one moreEmbed
