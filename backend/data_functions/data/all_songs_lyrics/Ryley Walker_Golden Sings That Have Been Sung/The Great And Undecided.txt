The Great And Undecided LyricsMy friend was a midnight writer
And I was a temporary hire
With no mandolin to hold to my chest
I guess it worked out for the best
And I heard ever since you crossed state lines
You found your dream job
My friend Joy wrote a song for me
She was singing it my room
She said you can play it anytime you’d like
If you tell the neighbors it’s my tune
And I heard ever since you crossed state lines
Your old man was sending you money
And I heard ever since you crossed state lines
Everybody was getting postcards
And you moved away to keep a distance
That’s kind of nice cause I like it here
I was the great and undecided
Holding a candle where the light isEmbed
