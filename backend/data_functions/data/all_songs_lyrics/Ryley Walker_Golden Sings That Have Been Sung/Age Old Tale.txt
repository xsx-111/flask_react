Age Old Tale Lyrics“Set me up”, says the man with a tall order
And age old tale, undersigned
Post script- "I ran out of space"
And “I can still smile with the taste of zig-zag”
Whats a mile a minute to somebody walking backwards in daylight savings time?
Not very fast I guess
Go on, take my advice brother
Skip out on the bill, and piss on the rest
Sitting in my beater
Dead of winter, busted heater
And it always feels like quitting time
I wanna pull you from my mind
Hold you in my hands, and let you unwind
In a harvest of sepia, you came as ox blood
Wednesday was a ruby, and Thursday was a flood
And I’m beloved by the loved, who love to love
And I can still cut loose on a weekday nightEmbed
