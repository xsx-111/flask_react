Butt Town Lyrics
The cops are well-groomed, with
Muscled physiques in Butt Town
Their tan uniforms are tailored in chic
In Butt Town
Any young black male who walks down the street
Is going to get stopped by a car full of meat
But the girl with the hair
Flies by in her underwear
She's done nothing so far to deserve that car
When you live in Butt Town
You got to get down

But in Butt Town I'm learning
In Butt Town I'm earning
In Butt Town I'm turning
Into my worst nightmare

I'm telling you, it's a motley crew in Butt Town
Monday you're new, and Friday you're through
In Butt Town
The producer is wily, and owns what he sells
The talent is eager to go straight to hell
The tits are amazing, and everyone's gazing
At some body part
That's the nature of art in Butt Town
All over Butt Town dreams have a show down
All over Butt Town values are thrown down

In Butt Town baby
I'm going to be a star
I'm going to shake my butt far
Now here we go
I'm going to shake my butt
Shake my butt, shake my butt
