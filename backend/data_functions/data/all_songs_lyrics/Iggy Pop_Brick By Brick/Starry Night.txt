Starry Night Lyrics
Stars in the sky
I like them better than you
Stars in the sky
They tell me what to do
I don't care about your city
Or your fat income
I don't care about your Vanity Fair
Or your fucking sitcom

Starry night
Starry night
That starry night

Makes me feel alright
I heard a lot of mean talking
I met a lot of tough guys
They all look pretty ugly under the stars
Go out to the desert
And just look up
You can feel yourself
Under the stars
All man's buildings
Will soon be gone
Because something here
Is absolutely wrong

Makes me feel alright
Like a human being
Take your building and your income
And shove it up your ass
Take your building and your income
And stuff it with your cash
I heard a lot of big talk, met a lot of tough guys
That shit looks ugly under a starry night
Which country is the strongest?
Who plays the best guitar?
Who fucking cares
Under the starsEmbed
