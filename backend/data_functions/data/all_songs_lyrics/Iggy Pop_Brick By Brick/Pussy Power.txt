Pussy Power Lyrics
An evil shadow across my brain
A certain burning that makes me insane
She's on my beam, oh no, she's in my room
She's all around me, now and I'm a tool

Pussy power
Pussy power
Pussy power
Pussy power

She wears a raincoat in the sun all day
She says she wants to have some fun, well, hey
She calls me over on the sidewalk
She's got a joint, she's got a cute walk


Pussy power, hour by hour
Pussy power oh what a flower
I want to hold her close to me
Because pussy power's pulling me
Down, Down, Down, Down
When it's there and I can't have it
I get real real rabid
I've got to figure out a way
I'm so pent-up, like this I can't stay
I've got to look this in the eye
I'm much too crazed, I'm much too shy
But all in all, at least I am I
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
