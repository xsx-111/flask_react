Home Lyrics
I work so hard, so don't trip me up
Shaking a leg like the tail of the pup
I'm paying dues until I register heat
Sure hope I don't end up on the street

Home, boy
Home, boy
Everybody needs a home
Home, boy
Home, boy
Everybody needs a home

So many people rise and fall
Who's looking after you at all?
Nobody knows anybody at all
Strangers in paradise down at the mall


The life we live is tricky, tricky
I love my home, and my family
Who's going to love you when the
Mountain gets steep?
We're going to make it in a JeepEmbed
