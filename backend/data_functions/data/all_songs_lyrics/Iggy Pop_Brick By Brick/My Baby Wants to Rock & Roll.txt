My Baby Wants to Rock & Roll Lyrics
My baby wants to rock and roll
She likes pictures and thoughts control
She's shopping wild and she's coming down
Superman couldn't turn her around

She wants to rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock and roll
Rock it on down until she cures her soul
She wants to rock her way right out of the hole
She wants to rock and rock and roll

She wants information and she wants it raw
She don't believe the way they lay things out
She's got to try it until she's too fucked up
I was the same way once myself
I had to rock
Going down those empty streets
You know what other guy's got all the money
He doesn't deserve it, screw him, rock and roll
Car crash on the grey highway
Bodies murmur under blankets
The party's in full swing
The boys are high and ready for fucking new blood
Bodies are needed constantly
Escapees from all history
Voyagers in the animal state, whoops!
Here come the assholes, they can smell the money
The meanest little bitch in 13 states
She's what God creates
She's got to rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock and roll
Rock it on down until she cures her soul
She got to to rock her way right out of the hole
She got to to rock and rock and roll

Nobody knows if she'll live or die
He wishes he was the cute one
But he's just the big one
He needs to rock and roll

He needs to got to rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock and roll
Rock it on down until it cures his soul
He needs to to rock his way right out of the hole
He needs to to rock and rock and roll...Embed
