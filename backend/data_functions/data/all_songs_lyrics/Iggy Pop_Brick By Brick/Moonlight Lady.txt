Moonlight Lady Lyrics
Who's going to tell you goodnight?
Who's going to put out the light?
I love you and love is almost crazy
Slipping through the so and so's
Over all the fields we go
Moonlight lady
Don't want to tell you so long
Don't want to mess up your song
Feeling like I do I'm almost crazy
Choosing all the red blue jeans
Watching people be so mean
Moonlight lady
I'm on fire
And I can hardly breathe
Time goes by
And all alone
My poor heart grieves
I love you just because I do
I didn't plan it with you
But now we're here
We might as well accept it
We're together for all time
Marching through the fields of dimes
