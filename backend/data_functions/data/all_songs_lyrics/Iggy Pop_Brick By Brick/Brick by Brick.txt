Brick by Brick Lyrics
People are so sad and I know why
With no chance to live before you die
You get pretty sick if you have to
Keep it inside
I want to build a house where an ad don't scream
I want to live in peace, quietly
I want to have a place of love and safety
People ought to live how and where they want
People ought to have respect in front
People ought to get along pretty OK

So get off my dick
I'm building it brick by brick
Brick by brick

I'm building a house where I can think
And have some balance and dignity
I'm building a house where no one can hurt me
I'm building a house where the weak are strong
I'm building a house with a real song
I'm using faith that is immortal
I'm building it with simplicity
And the way that we feel, you and me
I'm building it with what I believe in

Now I'm looking at just a little time
So be it, I want to
Be true to my simple heart
And not put nothing else above it
Brick by brick 
Brick by brick by brickEmbed
