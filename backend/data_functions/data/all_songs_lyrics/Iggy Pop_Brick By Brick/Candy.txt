Candy Lyrics
It's a rainy afternoon in 1990
The big city
Geez, it's been twenty years
Candy, you were so fine

Beautiful, beautiful girl from the North
You burned my heart with a flickering torch
I had a dream that no one else could see
You gave me love for free

Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go
All my life, you're haunting me, I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go

Life is crazy
Candy, baby

Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left
Hey, I'm glad you got out, but, but I miss you

I've had a hole in my heart for so long
I've learned to fake it and just smile along
Down on the street, those men are all the same
I need a love, not games, not games
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go
All my life, you're haunting me, I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go

Life is crazy
I know, baby
Candy, baby
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go
All my life, you're haunting me, I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy, life is crazy
Candy, baby
Candy, baby
Candy, Candy

Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go
All my life, I'm waiting for your loving so
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go

Candy, baby
I can't let you goEmbed
