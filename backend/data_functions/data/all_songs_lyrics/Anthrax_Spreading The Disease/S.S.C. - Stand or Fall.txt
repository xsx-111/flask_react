S.S.C. / Stand or Fall Lyrics

Fighting for existence, looking for a way
The race is getting harder, won't last another day
Try to make it happen, always on the go
Can't escape the hours, time will never know

Right now my new life has begun
I have to stand tall I can't run
They're trying to to take it away
I'm fighting the battle I...

Stand or fall, leave it to no one
Stand or fall, fight for my right
Stand or fall, they'll never break me
Stand or fall, Stand or fall

Looking deep inside myself to change
My world around
Never find an answer, but I still stand my ground
Never ending battle, my everlasting will
I'll come back when it's over, come back for the kill
Right now my new life has begun
I have to stand tall I can't run
They're trying to to take it away
I'm fighting the battle I...

Stand or fall, leave it to no one
Stand or fall, fight for my right
Stand or fall, they'll never break me
Stand or fall, Stand or fall

Honor and loyalty so hard to find
People I've trusted they're all left behind
Truth is the virtue they no longer seek
Stand with the strongest or fall with the weak

Right now my new life has begun
I have to stand tall I can't run
They're trying to to take it away
I'm fighting the battle I...

Stand or fall, leave it to no one
Stand or fall, fight for my right
Stand or fall, they'll never break me
Stand or fall, Stand or fall
Stand or fall, Stand or fall
Stand or fall, Stand or fall
Stand or fall, Stand or fallEmbed
