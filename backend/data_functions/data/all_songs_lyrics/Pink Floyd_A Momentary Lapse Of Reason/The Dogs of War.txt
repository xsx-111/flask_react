The Dogs of War Lyrics
Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don’t discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather round and haggle
For hard cash we will lie and deceive
Even our Masters don’t know the webs we weave

One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world… One world

Invisible transfers and long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can’t stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have our dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and they're gonna smash it down
One world… One world

One world… One world


The dogs of war don’t negotiate
The dogs of war won’t capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they’ve been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change you know the dogs remain

One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we're gonna smash it down
One world… One world

One world… One world
One world… One world4Embed
