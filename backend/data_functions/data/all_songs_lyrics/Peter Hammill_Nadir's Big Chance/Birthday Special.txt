Birthday Special LyricsI've got something to say
And it ain't the usual sort of sob-story
That you hear every day
I've got something to ask
And I know that now's the time
Now all the rooms of the party are dark
Proffer me the candy
Yes, I understand is fine;
Blow another candle out
And throw another lineâ€¦
Birthday girl, I've got something for you
There's ice in the cauldron, look out now;
Birthday girl, here comes a special
Like Hansel and Gretel never had
There's parrots in the pantry
And there's lizards in the loo;
There's bloaters in the bathroom
And this party is a zoo;
I'm sitting in the kitchen
Trying hard to talk to you
Birthday girl, I've got something for you
There's ice in the cauldron, look out now;
Birthday girl, here comes a special
Like Hansel and Gretel never had
I just wanted to say
That I'd like to make this the happiest of all your birthdays
And if that means turning the key
Then I'll turn it with you and there'll be no doubt
About the way I agree
Birthday girl, I've got something for you
There's ice in the cauldron, look out now;
Birthday girl, here comes a special
Like Hansel and Gretel never hadEmbed
