Airport LyricsI stand on the tallest building
And stare down at the grey runway
And the tail-smoke of the Boeing jet
That's taking you so far away
Believe me, I don't want you to leave me;
Look in my eyes and you'll see them
Filled with pain
Imagine just how sad I'll be
In some future day when I turn
And no longer see your face
All I can now cry is goodbye, love, goodbye
In a week, in a month, in a year
In a lifetime how I'll feel none can tell
All I know is now you're going
There's really no-one here to help
Believe me, I don't want you to leave me;
Look in my eyes and you'll see them
Filled with pain
Imagine just how sad I'll be
In some future day when I turn
And no longer see your face
All I can now cry is goodbye, love, goodbye
Already it's too late, you're through the boarding-gate
And walking on the tarmac
Already you are free, already you've left me
And cannot bear to look back, can you?
A brief taxi on the runway
Then up into the stilling night sky;
And I'm standing on the observation tower
My eyes too dimmed by distance to cry
Believe me, I don't want you to leave me;
Look in my eyes and you'll see them
Filled with pain
Imagine just how sad I'll be
In some future day when I turn
And no longer see your face
All I can now do is walk away alone
Without youEmbed
