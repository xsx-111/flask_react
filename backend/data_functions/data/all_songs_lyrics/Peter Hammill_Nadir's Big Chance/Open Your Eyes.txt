Open Your Eyes LyricsI was sitting in the dance-hall
But my mind was far away
So when the usherette walked over
I didn't know quite what to say
I tried to look cool
But I knew that I blew it somehow
Her fishnet tights took me quite by surprise...
I had to open my eyes
I told her I was dancing
But she didn't seem to hear;
She asked if I wanted to learn judo
Then she threw me out on my ear
Before I'd even had time to take a bow
I landed on the street, all dishevelled my disguise
But I really opened her eyes
So if you're leaning over the balcony
Or hanging around the floor
These are the last of the days of the Locarnos--
There really are no more
And the usherette smiles
But she's not telling all she knows....
But there's time in the end for us all to get wise
If we only open our eyesEmbed
