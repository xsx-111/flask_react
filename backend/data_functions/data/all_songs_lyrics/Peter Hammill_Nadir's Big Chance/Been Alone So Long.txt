Been Alone So Long LyricsBeen alone so long
That I've forgotten what it's like
To feel somebody next to me
And hear her breathing peacefully
When I wake up at night
Been alone so long
That I've forgotten what to say -
If I meet somebody who
Might easily resemble you
I smile, but look away...
I look away
Been alone so long
That I've forgotten what to do:
How to make the whole thing right
And how to help if she's uptight
And when to run and when to fight...
How to make her stay the night -
That's if I ever knew
Been alone so long
That I've forgotten what it's like
To feel somebody next to me
And hear her breathing peacefully
When I wake up at night
Wake up at nightEmbed
