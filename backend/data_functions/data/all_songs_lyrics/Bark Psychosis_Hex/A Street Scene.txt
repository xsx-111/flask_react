A Street Scene LyricsI'm sure you can make it
Flip side while nothing changes
I run past your street, deserted
Fading light on your fading face
Incision carved out
No traces of doubt
I can't extract the truth
You know it
But what you give, you get
While this place spins
Like a heavy doorway
But you've seen it all
Pretence, rip this town
You turn my world upside down
Incision carved out
No traces of doubt
I can't extract the truth
You know it
But what you give, you get
While this place spins
Like a heavy doorway
Gather it around
You built it up
So tear it downEmbed
