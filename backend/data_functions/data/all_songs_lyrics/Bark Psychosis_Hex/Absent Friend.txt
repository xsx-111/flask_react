Absent Friend LyricsSo, satisfied, leave without a trace
You taught me doubt still, you do it again
And it's high time I found myself on the road
Educate myself 'til it hurts
And it's high time I satisfy what it takes
It all just seems so differently
And that's the biggest joke of all
You know it's the biggest joke of all
And it's high time I recognize
So do it again
And it's growing outside my walls
I can't relate to where I've been
I can't tell you anything at all
And that's the biggest joke of all
You know it's the biggest joke of allEmbed
