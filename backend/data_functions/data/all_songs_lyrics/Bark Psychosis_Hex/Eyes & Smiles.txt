Eyes & Smiles LyricsLay down low
You give it all
Fresh trace on my back
Hands on my face
You want it all
Lay down low
Lay down low
Eyes wide
Watch them disappear
Take this back;
'Cause, I know you
Won't live it down
All this time
Just dissolving
The black and blue
Sure as hell
Lights stream past
Like a fountain
Just running back
So leave it one step further back
Just leave it one step further back
Leave it one step further back
One step, one step, one step, one step
One step, one step, one step, one step
One step, one step, one step, one step
One step, one step, one step, one step
One step, one step, one step
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go2Embed
