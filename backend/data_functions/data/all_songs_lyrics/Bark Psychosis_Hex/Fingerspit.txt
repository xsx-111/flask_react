Fingerspit Lyrics
Every day and every night
Streets leave their mark on my skin
The city breaks you down

Reach inside, it's upside down
I can't find any way out
So throw away your promises
Speak in tongues, don't reach inside my head

Every day and every night
Blood red cuts across my flesh
You can't see beyond your face

Reach inside, it's upside down
I can't find any way out
So throw away your promises
Speak in tongues, can't find my head

So quit while you're still ahead

Reach inside, it's upside down
I can't find any way out
So throw away your promises
Speak in tongues, can't find my head
And every day, and every night
And every day2Embed
