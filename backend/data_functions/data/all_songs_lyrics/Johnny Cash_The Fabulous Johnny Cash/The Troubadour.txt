The Troubadour Lyrics(Troubadour, troubadour, troubadour)
The troubadour, the troubadour
Sings from his heart, the song that's the hit of the show
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar
Alone in the bright spotlight's glow
The song was for someone he loves so true
Who loved him and left him for someone new
The troubadour, the troubadour
Smiles as he sings, but his heart is breaking in two
(Troubadour, troubadour, troubadour, troubadour)
They begged for more, the troubadour
Sings once again, the song that's the hit of the show
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar
Alone in the bright spotlight's glow
There is a hush in the darkened hall
A few hearts are heavy and teardrops fall
But in the crowd one head is bowed for the troubadour
And oh her heart aches most of all
Troubadour, troubadour
Her heart aches most of all
(Troubadour)Embed
