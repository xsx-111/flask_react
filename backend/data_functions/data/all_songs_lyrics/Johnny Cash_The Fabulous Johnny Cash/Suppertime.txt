Suppertime Lyrics
Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play until evening time would come
Then winding down an old familiar pathway I hear my mother call at setting sun

Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at last
Some of the fondest memories of my childhood are woven around suppertime. When mother used to call from the back steps of the old homeplace, "Come on home now son, it's suppertime." My how I'd love to hear that once again. But you know time has woven for me a realization of a truth that's even more thrilling. That soon we'll be called together around the great supper table up there for the greatest suppertime of them all with our Lord. I can almost hear the call now coming through the portals of heaven, "Come home son, it's suppertime. Come on home."

Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at last

Through the distant clouds I see my mother
Her face is shining bright, with tender love
She's gone up in heaven, with her maker
And I can still hear her voice, from up above
(and she said)

Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at lastEmbed
