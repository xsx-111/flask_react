Run Softly, Blue River Lyrics
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep
Oh I thrill to her kisses and she thrills to mine
Run softly while she sleeps and dreams for a time
Cause she dreams of tomorrow when she'll be my wife
And I pray that as peaceful as you is our life
And if your murmuring soothes me till I'm sleeping too
Run softly Blue River we'll both dream with you
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
Oh I thrill to her kisses
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)Embed
