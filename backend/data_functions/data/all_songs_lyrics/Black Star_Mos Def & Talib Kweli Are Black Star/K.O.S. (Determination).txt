K.O.S. (Determination) Lyrics
So many MC's focusin' on black people extermination
We keep it balanced with that knowledge of self, determination
It's hot, we be blowin' the spots with conversations
C'mon, let's smooth it out like Soul Sensation
We in the house like Japanese in Japan, or Koreans in Korea
Head to Philly and free Mumia with the Kujichagulia (True)
Singin' is swingin' and writin' is fightin'
But what they writin' got us clashin' like Titans, it's not excitin'
No question! Bein' a black man is demandin'
The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin'
(The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin')
(The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin')

With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'

Yes, yes, come on, yes, yes
Knowledge of self is like life after death
With that, you never worry about your last breath
Death comes, that's how I'm livin', it's the next days
The flesh goes underground, the book of life, flip the page
Yo, they askin' me how old, we livin' the same age
I feel the rage of a million niggas locked inside a cage
At exactly which point do you start to realize
That life without knowledge is death in disguise?
That's why, knowledge of self is like life after death
Apply it to your life, let destiny manifest
Different day, same confusion
We're gonna take this hip-hop shit and keep it movin'
Shed a little light
Now y'all bloomin' like a flower with the power of the evident
Voices and drums — original instruments
In the flesh, presently presentin' my representation
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'

The most important time in history is, NOW, the present
So count your blessings, 'cause time can't define the essence
But you stressin' over time when you follow the Roman calendar
These people into clonin' like Gattaca
You can bet they tryin' to lock you down like Attica
The African diaspora represents strength in numbers
A giant can't slumber forever
I know you gotta get that cheddar, whatever
A-yo, I heard you twice the first time, money, get it together
You must be history — you repeatin' yourself out of the pages
You keepin' yourself depleatin' your spiritual wealth
That quick cash'll get your ass quick fast in houses of detention
Inner-city concentration camps where no one pays attention
Or mentions the ascension of death, 'til nothing's left
The young, gifted and Black are sprung, addicted to crack
All my people, where y'all at? 'Cause y'all ain't here
And your hero's usin' your mind as a canvas to paint fear
With broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration
You get out of jail with that knowledge of self (Determination)
Stand in ovation, because you put the hue in human
Cause and effect affect everythin' you do
And that's why I got love in the face of hate
Hand's steady, so the lines in the mental illustration is straight
That thought you had don't even contemplate
Infinite like figure eight, there's no escape
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'
(This the funky singin' by Miss Vinia Mojica
This the funky singin' by Miss Vinia Mojica
Knowledge of self)
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'
What I'm feelin, what I'm feelin, ooooh, what I'm feelin'6Embed
