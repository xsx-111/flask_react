Brown Skin Lady Lyrics
You got that good hair, too
You like what?
I like girls with that light complexion on 'em
You're a moron
I can't help it
What? Being a moron?
Yeah, that too
You're the first one out there with a dashiki talking that crap
I'm a victim
"Good hair", nigga, you so brainwashed
I'm a victim, brother
You're a "victim," shut up
I'm a victim of four hundred years of conditioning
Shut up
The Man has programmed my conditioning
Mhm
Even my conditioning has been conditioned

But most of y'all brothers came from your mothers
Lookin' all sweet (Black Star keep shinin')
And be like yo, let me ask you somethin'
I wanna know, I wanna know who you are

Brown skin lady, hey hey
Yes
Where you goin'?
This goes to the brown skin ladies, yo
Brown skin lady
Indigenous women of the planet Earth
What you doin'?
Givin' birth to the brown skin ladies first
Brown skin lady
For what it's worth, from me to you
How do you feel?
From me to you, watchin' you
I like the way you walk, when you walk on by
I like the, I like the, I like the, I like the way you walk
I like the way you move, when you do that dance
Yes, I like the way you move
I like the way you walk, when you walk on by
I like the, I like the, I like the, I like the way you walk
I like the way you move, when you do that dance
Please, won't you do that dance?

And everybody on the avenue I know, when they see her say
On the block
Everybody on the avenue I know, when they see her say
There she is!

Fresher than Tony Rebel's vegetables at African street festivals
Where incredible women is plentiful
Over the years, I met a few, none of them compare to you
Preparin' you to make fruit bearable, somethin' terrible, let's see:
You fruitful, beautiful, smart, lovable, huggable
Doable like art, suitable to be part of my life
Coppertone owe you copyright infringement, pay
You been this tan since way back in the day
It's like I'm standin' there, you know, appreciatin' God's design
And then you showed up, it's like you read my mind
DAMN, she's fine! I think I'd add the R-E in front of that
And see if she D to get wit' a cat like me
I like the way you walk, when you walk on by
I like the, I like the, I like the, I like the way you walk
I like the way you move, when you do that dance
Yes, I like the way you move
I like the way you walk, when you walk on by
I like the, I like the, I like the, I like the way you walk
I like the way you move, when you do that dance
Please, won't you do that dance

And everybody on the avenue I know, when they see her say
On the block
Everybody on the avenue I know, when they see her say
There she is!

Ooooh! Damn, baby girl, look at you!
Comin' on the block, lookin' fresh and brand new
Ooooh! Head wrap cover your hairdo
Pretty feet peekin' through open-toed shoe
Ooooh! No limit to what I would do
Make love to you like long interview
Whooh! Is she for real? Me like you
Good look, champion, win the title
True, many man try invite you
Shot down lyric each time they cyph' you
Jewel, what man, ya get born inside zoo?
Feet, they walk way and just let she pass through
Ooooh! Can't be a next one like you
Famous like tapes made by DJ Clue
I tighten up my game as I approach you
Yo, check her, she the nectar the bee get close to

I don't get many compliments, but I am confident
Used to have a complex about gettin' too complex
You got me, willin' to try, looked me in the eye
My head is still in the sky, since you walked on by, I'm feelin' high
Got my imagination flickerin' like hot flames is how it seems
You make me wanna ride the Coltrane to A Love Supreme
My brown lady, create environments for happy brown babies
I know it sounds crazy
But your skin's the inspiration for cocoa butter
You provoke a brother, we should get to know one another
I discover when I bring you through, my people say "True!"
All I can say is all praise due, I thank God for a beauty like you

Brown skin lady, hey hey
Yes
Where you goin'?
This goes to the brown skin ladies yo
Brown skin lady
Indigenous women of the planet Earth
What you doin'?
Givin' birth to the brown skin ladies first
Brown skin lady
For what it's worth, from me to you
How do you feel?
From me to you, watchin' you

I like the way you walk, when you walk on by
I like the, I like the, I like the, I like the way you walk
I like the way you move, when you do that dance
Yes, I like the way you move
I like the way you walk, when you walk on by
I like the, I like the, I like the, I like the way you walk
I like the way you move, when you do that dance
Please, won't you do that dance

And everybody on the avenue I know, when they see her say
On the block
Everybody on the avenue I know, when they see her say
There she is!

She's a brown skinned lady!
Such a brown skinned lady
She's a brown skinned lady!
She's a brown skinned lady
She's a brown skinned lady!
She's a brown skinned lady

Baby, what you mean you don't think you look good?
You know what some people put themselves through
To look just like you?
Dark stockin', high heels, lipstick, alla that
You know what?
Without makeup, you're beautiful
Whatcha you need to paint the next face for?
We're not dealin' with the European standard of beauty tonight
So turn off the TV, put the magazine away
In the mirror, tell me what you see
See the evidence of divine presence
Women in the Caribbean, they got the, golden sun
I know women on the continent got it
Nigeria and Ghana, you know they got it
Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique
And Botswana, to let it speak
How 'bout Latinas, Colombianas
Cubanas, Dominicanas, Tahinians
Of course, the Brooklyn women walk that walk
And the Bronx women walk that walk
Hunnies from Queens walk that walk
NYC, ATL, LA, Cincinnati, the Bay Area
Got the cocoa butter brown skinned ladies doin' their thing
In London and Paris, cocoa butter brown sk...8Embed
