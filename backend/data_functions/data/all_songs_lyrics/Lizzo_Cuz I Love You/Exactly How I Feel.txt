Exactly How I Feel Lyrics
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel

I woke up this morning (God)
Wrong side of the bed
I don't have to 'splain it, oh (How I feel)
I might be a bitch (Bitch)
I might make a friend (Friend)
Ain't I so amazing? (Uh-huh)

Love me or hate me
Ooh, I ain't changing
And I don't give a fuck, no

That's exactly how I feel (Uh)
That's exactly how I feel (Say it again)
That's exactly how I feel (Woo)

Don't hide no emotions (Emotions)
Wear 'em on my sleeve (On my sleeve)
All my feelings Gucci (It's Gucci, haha)
Can't hold back my tears
That would be a crime
'Cause I look pretty cryin'
Oh, they ain't tell you?
Love me or hate me
Ooh, I ain't changing
And I don't give a fuck, no

That's exactly how I feel (How I feel, yeah)
That's exactly how I feel (How I feel, it's Gucci)
That's exactly how I feel

I feel like hurtin' they feelings (Yeah)
I don't get mad, I get millions (Yeah)
My heart ain't got no feelings
My cars ain't got no ceiling
I ain't with that acting all friendly
Please step away from the Bentley
You're either not with me or with me
The fye close by like it's Whitney
Stay in your lane, don't tempt me
Mr. Bust-A-Whole-Clip-'Til-It's-Empty
I got a feelin' that tonight's gonna be a good night
Like Ferg and them said, god willing
Fire chains on like burr (Burr)
Feelin' like rockin' my fur (Fur)
Rolls Royce with the chauffeur (Huh?)
How your toes feel on a mink fur?
It's Gucci
Cry 'cause I want to
Smile if I want to, huh
Yes, I can
Love 'cause I want to
Get so mad I could scream (I could scream)
I could scream (I could scream)
I could scream (Sing it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's exactly how I feel (How I feel)
That's exactly how I feel (How I feel)
That's exactly how I feel5Embed
