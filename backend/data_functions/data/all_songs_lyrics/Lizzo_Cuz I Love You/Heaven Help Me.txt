Heaven Help Me Lyrics
Heaven, help me
If love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Cold world, they'll be livin' in a fantasy
Got me, it's the only thing I'll ever need
Heaven, help me
If love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Love is a drug, methamphetamine
D-A-R-E, they'll be hooked on me

Y'all, who you think you sassing? (Sassing)
Say whoa, baby, I'm a classic (Classic)
Say whoa, something like a Hitchcock
Say whoa, got you goin' psycho (Psycho)
Oh no, don't you get your shit rocked
Say whoa, Kesha with the tick tock
Say whoa, time's up on these motherfuckers
Say whoa, what you say, what you say, sucker?
(What you say? What you say?)
Say whoa

If you think you got me dickmatized
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
I need to get you out of my life
Can I get an amen?
Heaven, help me
If love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Cold world, they'll be livin' in a fantasy
Got me, it's the only thing I'll ever need
Heaven, help me
If love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Love is a drug, methamphetamine
D-A-R-E, they'll be hooked on me

Hit 'em with the bye bye (Bye bye), say whoa
Hit 'em with the drive-by (Brrr), say whoa
Hit 'em with the dry cry (Dry cry), say whoa
Then you get a new guy, hello

Even if you are the love of my life
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Sorry, baby, I got too much pride

Heaven, help me
If love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Cold world, they'll be livin' in a fantasy
Got me, it's the only thing I'll ever need
Heaven, help me
If love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Love is a drug, methamphetamine
D-A-R-E, they'll be hooked on me
Heaven, help me
If love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Ooh, can I get an amen? (Amen)

Been thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you
Thinkin' about you baby
If love didn't drive me crazy, maybe I'd be your baby
Trust, baby, you can't make me beg or try to change, hey2Embed
