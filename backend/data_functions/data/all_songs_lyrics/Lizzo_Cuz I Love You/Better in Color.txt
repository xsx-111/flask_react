Better in Color Lyrics
Black, white, ebony all sound good to me
Two tone recipe, got good chemistry
J. F. Kennedys, kiss hood celebrities
Don't matter to me 'cause I like everything

You can be my lover
'Cause love looks better in color
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, tell 'em)

Big dick energy (Tell 'em)
Tastes like collard greens (Tell 'em)
Big ass patty cake (Tell 'em)
Hey, happy days (Tell 'em)
Bitch, don't label me (Tell 'em)
I'm me, famously (Tell 'em)
Nobody's safe, nobody
You and you and you and

You can be my lover
'Cause love looks better in color
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Color
Love looks better
Love, love looks better (You know it do)
In color, ooh
If I try to tell you, then you try to hurt me
Ya'll don't hear me

Sick six piston (Tell 'em)
Tiptoe kissin' (Tell 'em)
Catcall kittens (Tell 'em)
Whole milk lickin' (Tell 'em)
See my vision (Tell 'em)
Rainbow smitten (Tell 'em)
It's easy, baby, got the whole world for the pickin'

You can be my lover
'Cause love looks better in color
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Color
My whole world o' color, babe
Love looks better
Love, love looks better
In color, ooh (Rainbows and shit)
Oh, if I try to tell you then you try to hurt me
I'ma tell your momma
Color me, color me, color me, color me
Color me, color me, color me, color me
Color me, color me, color me, color me
Color me, color me, color me, color me

Yeah, you can be my lover
'Cause love looks better in color
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's dark under the covers
But love looks better in color2Embed
