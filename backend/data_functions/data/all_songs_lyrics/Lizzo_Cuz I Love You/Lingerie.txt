Lingerie Lyrics
(Yeah)
Damn

Hair down, moonlit
Look at my lipstick
So thick, so fit
Wanna put your lips in places, ooh
The sun don't shine there
I like that right there (I like that)
Keep goin’ and goin' and keep it flowin', uh
You know what you doin’, don't you?

So I lounge around in my lingerie
I wanna be prepared for you just in case
So I lounge around in my lingerie
You better come my way

I don't got no secrets you don't know
These panties are see-through, I'm exposed, yeah
Treat you with my body, my eyes closed
Baby, let me feel you close
You make me crescendo, I'm going up
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Let's open the window
And let the world know
Oh, oh, oh
So I lounge around in my lingerie
I wanna be prepared for you just in case
So I lounge around in my lingerie
You better come my way

Yeah, yeah, ow
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

So I lounge around in my lingerie
I wanna be prepared for you just in case, yeah
So I lounge around in my lingerie
Ooh, you better come my way1Embed
