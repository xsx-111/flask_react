Cry Baby Lyrics
Pull this car over, babe
Don't pretend like you don't know
A lot of girls have time for this shit
Honestly, I don't

He said, "Why you cryin', baby?
Why you cryin', baby?
What did I do?" Oh
I said, shut up and kiss me, oh
'Cause I don't wanna be here for long

I swore you'd never see this side
But it's so hard to say goodbye
I don't need to apologize
Us big girls gotta cry

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You should feel honored boy, uh
You got me feelin' this much
I clear my schedule for you
Let my guard down for you
And you gon' make me put it back up
Oh, you know why I'm cryin'
Why I'm cryin', baby
You don't pick up the phone
You do the same thing to your friends and family
You gon' end up alone

I swore you'd never see this side
But it's so hard to say goodbye
I don't need to apologize
Us big girls got to cry

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

It feels so good, so good sometimes
Some big girls gotta cry
After this is done, just take me home
I'm feelin' vulnerable
I don't need to apologize
Us big girls gotta cry

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, it's my life
You know it hurts sometimes
My love is your love
Why can't your love be mine?
Ooh, ooh
Oh, I get a little lost sometimes
Sometimes you need to cryEmbed
