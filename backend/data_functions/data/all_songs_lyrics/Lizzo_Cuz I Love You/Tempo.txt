Tempo Lyrics
I've been waitin' for this one
Turn it up

Slow songs, they for skinny hoes
Can't move all of this here to one of those
I'm a thick bitch, I need tempo (Tempo)
Fuck it up to the tempo

Pitty-pat, pitty-pat, pitty-pitty-pat (Pat)
Look at my ass, it's fitty-fitty-fat (Fat)
Kitty cat, kitty cat, kitty-kitty cat (Cat)
Prrr me a glass, boy, I like my water wet (Wet)
Throw it back (Throw it back, threw it back)
Catch that (Catch that, catch that)
I need a jack (Woo)
For all of this ass, but it won't go flat (Wait a minute)
Baby, baby (Baby)
Come eat some of this cakey (Cake)
He look like he could gain a little weight (A little weight)
Lick the icing off, put the rest in your face (Face)

Slow songs, they for skinny hoes
Can't move all of this here to one of those (Hey)
I'm a thick bitch, I need tempo (Need it)
Fuck it up to the tempo
Fuck it up to the tempo
Fuck it up to the tempo
Slow songs, they for skinny hoes
Fuck it up to the tempo (Tempo)
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Boyfriend watchin', oh now he wanna knuckle up
Get on this ride, baby, you gon' have to buckle up
Thick thighs save lives, call me little buttercup
All means necessary (Ayy)
My ass is not an accessorary (What?)
Yeah, I said it, accessorary (What?)
Twerk skills up on legendary

Slow songs, they for skinny hoes
Can't move all of this here to one of those (Hey)
I'm a thick bitch, I need tempo (Need it)
Fuck it up to the tempo
Fuck it up to the tempo
Fuck it up to the tempo
Slow songs, they for skinny hoes
Fuck it up to the tempo (Missy)

Let's go (Let's go), let's go (Let's go)
All the fly girls head to the dance floor
Kitty cat, kitty cat, prrr
All the thick girls down on the flrrr (On the floor)
Ice on my neck like brrr (Like brrr)
I'm big-boned with nice curves (Nice curves)
Look at me, I know I look grrrd (Good)
Look good, look good, look grrrd (Look good)
I'ma show y'all chicks how to drrr it
Your nigga, he wish he could
Thick girl (Thick girl), split (Split)
Get a bag (Get a bag), get rich (Get rich)
Hair done (Hair done), fixed (Fixed)
If you see a hater, tell him quit (Stop)
Get your own dough (Own dough)
Get your bread, own dough (Own dough)
Go on, ladies, head to the floor (Floor)
Fuck up the tempo, thick girls get low (Woo)
Slow songs, they for skinny hoes
Can't move all of this here to one of those (Hey)
I'm a thick bitch, I need tempo (Need it)
Fuck it up to the tempo
Fuck it up to the tempo
Fuck it up to the tempo
Slow songs, they for skinny hoes
Fuck it up to the tempo
