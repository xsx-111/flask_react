Lune TNS Lyrics
Yo word the fuck up this is for.. (DJ Mr. Len)
My motherfuckin (El-P) undisputed Stylemaster
(CoFlow) Phase 2 (Bigg Jus) yo check it

The elevated trainline of the J line and the A
Where I first encountered the likes of Baby168
Stan, Iz the Wiz, K56, T.K.A
Kingpin throwups and way back then was it
Who I saw rippin' I write up on the inside rode E
As I progressed to the 7 yard, early Johnny D
Caine, Officer147, C.I.A
Fuzz, Comet, Blade, Ajax and Angelduster
Cuttin school with Roman, hittin' my first uni-wide
Ridin the L, overlookin' the handball courts
A giant top to bottom, Flame Demo T.P.A
Ghost T.M.R, Ezo C.U.K
Switchin' gears, Later on towards the end
Who could forget the Master Destruction
Led by Quik, Sach and Min
Destroyin' all lines of thought, the Vamp Squad were bugged

I was a young kid, watchin' these writers styles that bugged
Fab Five Freddy, Doc, Mono, Stitch, Slug
I was a young kid, watchin' these writers styles that bugged
Futura, Adam, Lee, Kay, Park, Dirty Slug
I keep it movin' like Flint 707
I'm out to bomb Ban 2, Gun Hill Road 2's and 5's
Riff 170, so hard this style be, F.B.I
Python, Dart, Bramble?, 147 Shy
Rockin' whole cars, U.A, Seen, Kel and Crash
Just to name a few style elements from my past then
While my crew tend to see technology in it's grasp
From All City built upon the foundation of true masters
Therefore wanna architect, the deformed b-boyism I'm mackin'
NY Indelible will continue to kick advance material that's classic
From the Merrick Bus Yards to the uptown 1 2's and 3's
From the Queens parts and lay-ups to the Brooklyn I-N-D's
I keep on like T-Kid, Lionel, West, Haze SE
Top Cat, rockin' them tall letters from Philly
To the transit cop, Curley, Furria, Hickey and Ski
Lady Pink, Lady Heart, add the essence Barbara E
Searchin' for the hidden message, hit up my aerosol alphabetics
Subvert word brutalizer
Critical thinkin modifier
Bigg Jus, Lune TNS, stark black tunnels, a live wire
Soaked in burgundy Flomaster
Marsh Opaque, homemade Pentels, Red Devil
Rust o' flat black, blend with Krylon Jade green
Mixed with amazon green, hit the ghostyards
Like T.N.T Skeme, the ex-vandal
Nicer T-A-T, Ebony Dukes
Vamm and Lee163, V-F-R Sharp Delta chrome
Iron Mike, 3YB
SUPERKOOL-223, Cay-161
Jon156, Cuz NFC
Stay High 149
Jester Mitch 77, El-T-N-S
Vade, Hondo U-G-A
Original freight hitter RibOne, AB 63
Cope Two, still showin' versatility
Peace to Dondi and 168 Tracy
I was a young kid, watchin' these writers styles that bugged
Fab Five Freddy, Doc, Mono, Stitch, Slug
I was a young kid, watchin' these writers styles that bugged
Futura, Adam, Lee, Kay, Park, Dirty Slug

Straight up, for niggas who don't understand
Obviously this wasn't made for you, so fuck you
Bigg Jus, Lune TNS and we out2Embed
