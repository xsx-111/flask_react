Might Lyrics
I might
And you might
But neither of us do, though
And neither of us will
I broke every bone in my goddamn jaw
That's a lot, it's the last one I ever got

I might
And you might
But neither of us do, though
And neither of us will
Yesterday night I broke every bone in my jaw
Laughed so loud, itâ€™s the last thing I ever gotEmbed
