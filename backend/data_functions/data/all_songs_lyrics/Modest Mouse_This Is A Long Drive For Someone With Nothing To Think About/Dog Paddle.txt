Dog Paddle Lyrics
I'm down on the water
(I'm down on the water)
I don't know so I don't bother
(I don't know so I don't bother)
Looking out the window of my dad's old Chevy
(Looking out the window of my dad's old Chevy)
Eats a lot of gas because it's that more heavy
(Eats a lot of gas because it's that more heavy)
I'm down on the county line and
(We're all down on the county line)
We're all screaming Carolina
(We're all screaming Carolina)

I'm down on the water
(I'm down on the water)
We don't like what we just saw but
(We don't like what we just saw but)
I can't swim so I dog paddle
(I can't swim so I dog paddle)
I can't swim so I dog paddle
I eat inside it feels like murder
I can't swim so I dog paddle
I can't swim so I dog paddle
I'm down on the water
(I'm down on the water)
I don't know so I don't bother
(We don't got no meat to swallow)
Looking out the window of my dad's old Chevy
(I can't swim so I dog paddle)
Eats a lot of gas because it's that more heavy
(I eat inside it feels like murder)
I'm down on the county line and
We're all singing Carolina
(I can't swim so I dog paddle)
We're down on the county line again
We're all screaming Caroline again
What you say and what you want again
You can't get it because you don't get it, no
(I'm down on the water)Embed
