Make Everyone Happy/Mechanical Birds Lyrics
And I said, "You shouldn't make facts out of opinions"
He said that I was right, you're right, I knew that I was
And I'd hate to see anybody fail
But I'd like to see you fail seeing me fail, though

I'm not sure who I am
I'm not sure who I am but I know who I've been

And I said, "You can't make everybody happy"
He said, "You'd like to at least make yourself happy, though"
I'm not sure who I am
I'm not sure who I am but I know who I've been2Embed
