Novocain Stain Lyrics
When I can work out how it was
Then I'll tell you
TV stained my memories, yeah
I don't fit the shoes

Remember through sounds
Remember through smells
Remember through colors
Remember through towns
With fear and fascination
On what was here and what's replacing them now

Interchanges, plazas and malls
And crowded chain restaurants
More housing developments go up
Named after the things they replace
So welcome to Minnow Brook
And welcome to Shady Space
Well it all seems a little abrupt
No, I don't like this change of paceEmbed
