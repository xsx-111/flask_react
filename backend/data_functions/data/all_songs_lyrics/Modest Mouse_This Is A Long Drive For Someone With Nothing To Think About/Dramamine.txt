Dramamine Lyrics
Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Feeling spaced, breathing out Listerine
I'd said what I'd said, that I'd tell ya
And that you'd killed the better part of me
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I'd said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything
We kiss on the mouth but still cough down our sleeves

Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Look at your face like you're killed in a dream
And you think you've figured out everything
I think I know my geography pretty damn well
You say what you need so you'll get more
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything16Embed
