Exit Does Not Exist Lyrics
Does

Exist
Take

Exit
Does
Not
Exist
Take
An
Exit

I hear voices insinuating
Feeds me lyrics to this song that I am saying
Sunlight, 7:20 PM, early September
Standing looking at a photograph
That you do not remember being taken
You look out of breath, and me like I am faking
As a matter of fact, I don't recall this photo being taken
You don't even actually exist, so I just started shaking

Does
Not
