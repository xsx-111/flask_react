Space Travel Is Boring LyricsWon herself a pass to some far off moon
It was second class but what's to lose?
And looking out her window she could more than assume
That you can't see air or time
She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face
She still got plenty lonely but that's just the case
With time, time, time
Started hearing voices sometime in June
She knew she could go crazy but didn't think that soon
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon
Try, try, try, try
Man shot to the moon
I bought a paperback and wanna go real soon
I'm shot to the moon
Been there a half an hour, I wanna come home soonEmbed
