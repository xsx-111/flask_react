Breakthrough Lyrics
I got one, two, three, four
Five, six, sick, sick
Running 'round the neighborhood
Pejorative, "Jinx," he said
The groom is down on me, 'cause he ate the rice
It was well-intentioned but bad advice
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah

Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah
Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah

Open the curtain
And let in some sky
It's almost half past two AM
You can tell by the light, oh yeah
Open your window
And let in the atmosphere, oh yeah

Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah
Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah
Open the curtain
And let in some sky
It's almost half past two AM
You can tell by the light
Open your window
And let in the atmosphere, oh yeah

Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah

I was inverted, I mean converted
I mean, I don't understand
I was inverted, I mean converted
I mean, I don't understand1Embed
