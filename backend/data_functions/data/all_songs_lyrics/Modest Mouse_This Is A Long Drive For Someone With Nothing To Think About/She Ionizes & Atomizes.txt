She Ionizes & Atomizes LyricsShe ionizes and atomizes
Then turns to sunlight
He realizes and itemizes
Pulls harder than gravity
She ionizes and atomizes
Then turns to sunlight
Fluorescent light-bulbs will
Make an absense of dark, but the light
Just ain't there still, and she said
"I am feeling empty
The real lights can make you heavy
But never ever really empty
(Fluorescent lights will always equal empty)"1Embed
