Head South Lyrics
A surf rock band from the land of plenty
Surf rock mess with no surf, just pine trees
Struck by being ashamed of your old space
Just wanting that mean heat
You bleached your hair and you pawned your skis
And then you sold out for the shade of the palm tree scene
And said, "Oh, what a drag! Oh, what a backwards scheme
'Cause here things go from gray to gray and back to gray again
And they get green and go to gray and go back to gray again"
So he said

"Head south! Head south!"
"Head south! Head south!" (Head south)
"Head south! Head south!"
"Head south! Head south!" (Head south)
"Head south! Head south!"
"Head south! Head south!" (Head south)
"Head south! Head south!"
"Head south! Head south!" (Head south)

Struck by being ashamed of your old space
Just wanting that mean heat
You bleached your hair and you pawned your skis
And then you sold out for the shade of the palm tree scene
Surrounded, cut off jeans and cut off jeans are
What you mean when you say
"Head south! Head south!"
"Head south! Head south!" (Head south)
"Head south! Head south!"
"Head south! Head south!" (Head south)
"Head south! Head south!"
"Head south! Head south!" (Head south)
"Head south! Head south!"
"Head south! Head south!" (Head south)1Embed
