Out the Blue Lyrics
Out the blue, you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy
Out the blue, you came to me

Every day, I thank the Lord and Lady
For the way that you came to me
Anyway, it had to be
Two minds, one destiny

Out the blue, you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy
Out the blue, you came to me

All my life has been a long slow knife
I was born just to get to you
Anyway, I survived
Long enough to make you my wife

Out the blue, you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy
Out the blue, you came to me

Like a U.F.O., you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy
Out the blue, you came to me1Embed
