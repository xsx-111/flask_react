Meat City Lyrics
Well I been Meat City to see for myself
Well I been Meat City to see for myself
Been Meat City, been Meat
Just got to give me some rock and roll

People were dancing like there's no tomorrow
Meat City
Finger licking, chicken picking, Meat City shook down U.S.A
Pig Meat City

Well I been the mountain to see for myself
Well I been the mountain to see for myself
Been the mountain, been the mountain
Just got to give me some rock and roll

Snake doctors shaking like there's no tomorrow
Freak City
Chicken sucking, mother trucking, Meat City shook down U.S.A
Pig Meat City

Well I'm goin' to China to see for myself
Well I'm goin' to China to see for myself
Goin' to China, goin' to
Just got to give me some rock and roll
People were jumping like there's no tomorrow
Meat City
Finger licking, chicken picking, Meat City shook down U.S.A
Pig Meat City

Well, I'm going to China
Yes, I'm going to China
Well, I'm going to China
Yes, I'm going to China
I'm going to China
Yes, I'm going to China
AlrightEmbed
