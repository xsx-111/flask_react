Tight A$ Lyrics
Well just as tight as you can make it
Hard and slow ain't hard enough
Just as tight as you can shake it girl
Get it on and do your stuff

Tight as you can get it
Tight as got it made
Uptight's alright, but if you can't stand the heat
You'd better get back in the shade

Just as tight as an Indian rope trick
Long and tough ain't hard enough
Just as tight as a dope fiend's fix, my friend
Get it up and do your stuff

Tight as you can boogie
Tight as got it made
Uptight's alright, but if you can't stand the heat
You better get back in the shade

Well, tight as you can make it
Hard and slow ain't hard enough
Just as tight as you can shake it girl
Get it on and do your stuff

Tight as you can get it
Tight as got it made
Uptight's alright, but if you can't stand the heat
You better get back in the shade

Well tight as an Indian rope trick
Hard and long ain't hard enough
Just as tight as a dope fiend's fix, my friend
Get it up and do your stuff

Tight as you can boogie
Tight as got it laid
Uptight's alright, but if you can't stand the heat
You better get back in the shade

Well, tight ass got me cornered
Tight ass got me laid
Tight ass strut your stuff so tough
Just sweating in the midnight shade
Tight as she can boogie
Tight ass, she got laid
Uptight's alright, but if you can't stand the heat
You better get back in the shade1Embed
