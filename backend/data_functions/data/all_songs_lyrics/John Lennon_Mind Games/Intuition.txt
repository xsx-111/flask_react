Intuition Lyrics
My intentions are good, I use my intuition
It takes me for a ride
But I never understood other people's superstitions
It seemed like suicide
As I play the game of life
I try to make it better each and every day
And when I struggle in the night
The magic of the music seems to light the way

Ah, intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me everywhere

Well my instincts are fine
I had to learn to use them in order to survive
And time af
Ter time confirmed an old suspicion
It's good to be alive
And when I'm deep down and out and lose communication
With nothing left to say
It's then I realize it's only a condition
Of seeing things that way
Ah, intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me anywhere
Takes me anywhere, alright


Ah, intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me thereEmbed
