Only People Lyrics
Only people know just how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world
Only people realize the power of people
Well, a million heads are better than one
So come on, get it on

Well I know how we tried
The millions of tears that we cried
Now we are hipper, we been through the trip
And we can't be denied with woman and man side by side
Make no mistake it's our future we're making
Bake the cake and eat it too
We don't want no big brother scene

Only people know just how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world
Only people realize the power of people
Well, a million heads are better than one
So come on, get it on

We'll it's long overdue
There ain't nothing better to do
Now we are hipper, we been through the trip
We can fly right on through
There's nothing on earth we can't do
Fish or cut bait, it's our future we're making
All together now pull the chain
We don't want no big brother scene
Only people know just how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world
Only people know just how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world
Only people know just how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world
Only people know just how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world
Only people know just how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world2Embed
