I Might Be Wrong (Live) Lyrics
I might be wrong, I might be wrong
I could have swore I saw a light coming on
I used to think, I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

Open up and let me in

Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
Nothing at all

What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?

Start again, begin again

Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time and never look back
Never look back, never look back
The lights go out, come and go
The lights go out, come and go
Yeah, yeah
I think we should stopEmbed
