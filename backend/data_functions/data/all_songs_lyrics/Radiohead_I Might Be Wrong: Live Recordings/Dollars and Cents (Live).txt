Dollars and Cents (Live) Lyrics
There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
Bear a weapon we can use
Be constructive with your blues
Even when it's only warnings
Even when you're talking war games

Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Quiet down
You don't live in a business world
 and you never stay
We all have goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe
It's all over the streets tonight
It's all over the streets so let me out of herе
It's all over the streets tonight
It's all over thе streets so let me out of here
All over the
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little skull
Crack your little skull
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little skull
Crack your little skull
We are the dollars and cents
(Pounds and pence)Embed
