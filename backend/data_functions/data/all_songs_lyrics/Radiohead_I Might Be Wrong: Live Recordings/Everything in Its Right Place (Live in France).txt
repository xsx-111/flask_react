Everything in Its Right Place (Live in France) Lyrics
Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood
(Here comes the flood)
One, two, three
One, one, two, three

Everything (Everything)
Everything (Everything)
Everything (Everything)
Everything
In its right place (In its right place)
In its right place (In its right place)
Right place (Right place)
Right place (Right place)

Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yеsterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yеsterday I woke up sucking a lemon

Everything (Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon)
Everything (Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon)
Everything (Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon)
In its right place (In its right place)
In its right place (In its right place)
Right place (Right place)
Right place (Right place)
There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What, what was that you tried to say?
What, what was that you tried to say?
Tried to say, tried to say
Tried to say, tried to say

(There are two colours in my head)Embed
