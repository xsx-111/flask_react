Morning Bell (Live in Oxford) Lyrics
The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Yeah
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park thе car?
Clothes are on the lawn with thе furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
And round
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

I wanna tell you but you'll never listen
I'll keep on walking
I wanna tell you but you'll never listen
I'll keep on walking
Over, over, over, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
The lights are on, but no one is home
Everybody wants to be a
Everybody wants to be a friend
Nobody wants to be a, then it's
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
The lights are on, but no one is home
Everybody wants to be a
Everybody wants to be a friend
Nobody wants to be a, then it's
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Thank youEmbed
