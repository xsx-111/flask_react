Idioteque (Live in Oxford) Lyrics

And the children first, and the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow until I burst
Until I burst, until I
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?

And children first, and children

Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time

The fathers for the children, the fathers to the children
The fathers to the children, the fathers to the children
The fathers to the children, the fathers to the children
The fathers to the children, the fathers

Oh yeah
Oh yeah, okayEmbed
