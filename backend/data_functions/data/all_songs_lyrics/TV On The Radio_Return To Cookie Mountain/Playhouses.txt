Playhouses LyricsPlayhouses
Swept away by the river now
Confounded
Sound it out now
Vodka cran in your hand and whose little girl are you now?
Oh, I'd ask for this dance
But I know you'd play like you don't know how
What your coy smile exposes
A recent memory of when we shit our bed of roses
And I know the moon above is shining down
But not for our love
So for who?
So for who?
Beneath the cigarettes and sugar shit of alcohol breath
I can taste the ocean on your tongue
Remember when we sat on the sidewalk of your old block
Against the wall under the stars
Talking about love's meaning
Well, I wasn't dreaming
I meant every word
Just didn't know your demons
Do you know mine, babe?
Are we wasting time, babe?
Playhouses
Haunted by
Broken spirits
Just trying to get high
Well, we chose this course but
The weather changed
And the river froze
And when it thawed it was running
Backwards and dry now
I suppose it's appropriate to cry now
Over wasted time
And naked lies
Still get wasted sometimes1Embed
