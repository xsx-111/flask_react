Hours LyricsYou walked around, thought yourself beautiful
Just too bad they stared, just too bad they stared
Broke up your crown, called you "unusable"
See how well you fared
Stole underground to kick your heart around
Banished from above, banished from above
Forgot yourself, your home and shot your health
Left it all for love
And on their lips
Delirious quips
Last seen with friends wishing them well
Delayed, seduced, you listened for the truth
Just too bad they lied, just too bad they lied
Oh, come around in form of future youth
Summoned from the sky
Ono omode, ono omode de
Ono omode, ono omode de
Ono omode, ono omode de
Ono omode, ono omode de
Refuse these cruel
Unusual fools
Leave them to rule
In hollow point hell
You've much to do, now listen to the truth
Cradled in a cry, cradled in a cry
Your light'll shine, fire undisputable
Keep your head on high, keep your head on high
Oh,  walk around, know you are beautiful
Aimless and alive, broken and divine
Oh, walk around, know you are future youth
Summoned to the sky3Embed
