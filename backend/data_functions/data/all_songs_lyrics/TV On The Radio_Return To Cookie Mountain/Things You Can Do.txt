Things You Can Do LyricsPrettiest one I know
Stole away all to show
You are so easy to love
You are so hard to let go
Prettiest world I know
Loveliest one I know
You were the first to come
We were the last to go
Prettiest world I know
You were so hard to let go
You were the dream of my heart
We were the last ones to know
We were the last ones to know
We were the last ones to knowEmbed
