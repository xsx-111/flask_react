Let the Devil In LyricsBeg the bee's forgiveness as it's falling from your sleeve
Watch its guts pump poison into sting
Watch it reach completeness, see it fall asleep
Legs above fold in eternal dream
Oh, that calls to mind a joke, an off coloring
About these fools blindfolded, drugged, and raped and left laughing
They let the devil in, he brought his pirate friends
They brought a hunger for blood and flesh and bone and skin
So teeth left chattering and tongues flexed to sing
Got dressed up in so many fancy things
Is it a waste of time? Tell me if you mind
Me dipping into useless sentimentality
A rant on how things used to be when this shit was free
I answered my own question, I can hear the crickets yawning
But in the back pocket of a discarded pair of jeans
Is still a priceless ticket to the grandest opening
So when the chariot arrives you'd best enjoy the ride
'Cause when we get to Heaven's gate we're not getting inside
Better beg forgiveness
Better drop to knees
Better find your ticket
Before we join the bees
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-ohEmbed
