Wash the Day Away Lyrics
Little flightless metal birds
High above in limbless tree
Echoes from their tiny box
Ring out into the atmosphere
Creating beauty inadvertently
It was a technological feat
Wading through the market's waste (This little bird)
We locked eyes, felt our loneliness abate
True desire showed its face, but only momentarily

Grey cascades in foreign waves
Wash the day away

I bought you flowers from the dying woods of Brazil (This little bird)
While the kids burned down the greenhouse pushed the charred frame into the landfill (Put his beak to the word)
We bought new bodies, we bought diamond encrusted guns (So who the hell are you?)
Making out so high in the backseat of a car-bomb under carcinogenic sun

Grey cascades in foreign waves
Wash the day away
Grey cascades in foreign waves
We did believe in magic, we did believe
We let our souls act as canaries
Our hearts gilded cages be
Watched a million dimming lanterns float out to sea
Lay your malady at the mouth of the death machine

Grey cascades in foreign waves
Wash the day away
Grey cascades in foreign waves
Wash the day awayEmbed
