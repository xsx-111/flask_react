I Was a Lover LyricsI was a lover before this war
Held up in a luxury suite, behind a well-barricaded door
Now that I've cleaned up, gone legit
I can see clearly, round hole
Round hole, square peg don't fit
I'm locked in my bedroom, so send back the clowns
My clone wears a brown shirt
And I seduce him when there's no one around
Mano y mano on a bed of nails
Bring it on like a storm
'Til I knock the wind out of his sails
And we don't make eye contact when we have run-ins in town
Just a barely polite nod
And nervous stares towards the ground
I once joined a priest class, plastic, inert
Slow-danced with commerce
Like a lens up a skirt
And we liked to party
And we kept it live
And we had a three volume tome of contemporary slang
To keep a handle on all this jive
Ennui unbridled, let's talk to kill the time
How many styles did you cycle through before you were mine?
And it's been a while since we went wild and that's all fine
But we're sleepwalking through this trial
And it's really a crime, it's really a crime, it's really a crime
It's really criminal
We're busy tempting like fate's on the nod
Running on empty, bourbon and God
It's been a while though since we knew the way
And it's been even longer
Since our plastic priest class had a goddamned thing
To say
I was a lover before this war
I was a lover before this war
I was a lover before this war4Embed
