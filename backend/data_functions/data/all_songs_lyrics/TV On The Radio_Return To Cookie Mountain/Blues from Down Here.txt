Blues from Down Here Lyrics
From the depths I called you, Ma
For your breath and breast so warm and fabled
Your hands reached inside
Grabbed my heart, enlarged, disabled
Hailed for your mercy
An ear that cares
How the blues sound from up there?

With my wet hair
I wipe the blood off of your feet
Carry me through these shark infested waters
Well, you spared
Me from slaughter for sure
But these sharks
Are equally in need of a martyr
Oh, kindness shared
Undeserved purest gift, this life you've spared
How the blues sound from up there?

Teeth gnashing
Masticating this dumb tongue
Quiet now, quiet now, hear that supplication
Echo into the void
Been received by no one
Oh, my sweet dear
Cold, alone, poisoning ourselves
Engulfed in our own tears
Signed, blues from down here
Signed, blues from down here
Signed, blues from down here
Pull the pin, drop it in, let it wash away your
Pull the pin, drop it in, let it wash away your
Pull the pin, drop it in, let it wash away your
Pull the pin, drop it in, let it wash away your
Pull the pin, drop it in, let it wash away your

Time for your favorite story
Of how to achieve golden glory
Wash yourself all squeaky clean
All in white, all hallow's eve
Lessen your desire
Hold your breath so patiently
Never inquire how to be free
Just stay on your knees
You might doubt it
Think there's nothing left for me
To do but stomp my feet and shout about it
From the depths I called you

Now I'm waiting for an answer patiently
Stuck here at the bottom of this well
It's not the last you've heard from meEmbed
