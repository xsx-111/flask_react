Dirtywhirl Lyrics
Oh, there is a murderess amongst us
Her love is a violent spiral
Hurling in upon us
Conjured up at the birth of the world
Durga is a dancer
Mindless questions find no answers
Slicing through the ether
Yeah, she's gleaming like mother of pearl

Dirty little whirlwind
Commander, controller, I found you
Dirty little whirlwind
I am pinned by the heat of your swirl
Dirty little whirlwind
Defender, destroyer, I found you
Dirty little whirlwind
Tangled up in the flesh of a girl

Oh, you could curl me beside you
The spark in your eyes belies the apocalypse inside you
Twisting the pits from the particle
Skull can't save face
So shake the shame from it
Burn me up inside you
Let me churn in your furnace of whirl
Dirty little whirlwind
Commander, controller, I found you
Dirty little whirlwind
I am pinned by the heat of your swirl
Dirty little whirlwind
Defender, destroyer, I found you
Dirty little whirlwind
All caught up in the flesh of a girl

All I ever wanted to be was destroyed at sea
Hurricane rescued me, salvaged calamity
All I ever wanted to be was destroyed at sea
Hurricane rescued me, salvaged calamity

Do not delay (All I ever wanted to be was destroyed at sea)
We stood in place for it (Hurricane rescued me, salvaged calamity)
Turn me up inside you (All I ever wanted to be was destroyed at sea)
Up and into the heart of your world (Hurricane rescued me, salvaged calamity)1Embed
