Wolf Like Me Lyrics
Say, say, my playmate
Won't you lay hands on me?
Mirror my malady?
Transfer my tragedy?
Got a curse I cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
When the moon is round and full
Gotta bust that box, gotta gut that fish (My mind's aflame)
We could jet in a stolen car
But I bet we wouldn't get too far
Before the transformation takes
And blood lust tanks and crave gets slaked

My mind has changed my body's frame, but, God, I like it
My heart's aflame, my body's strained, but, God, I like it
My mind has changed my body's frame, but, God, I like it
My heart's aflame, my body's strained, but, God, I like it

Charge me your day rate
I'll turn you out in kind
When the moon is round and full
Gonna teach you tricks that'll blow your Mongrel mind
Baby doll, I recognize
You're a hideous thing inside
If ever there were a lucky kind
It's you, you, you, you
I know it's strange, another way to get to know you
You'll never know unless we go so let me show you
I know it's strange, another way to get to know you
We've got 'til noon, here comes the moon, so let it show you
Show you now

Dream me, oh, dreamer, down to the floor
Open my hands and let them weave onto yours
Feel me, completer, down to my core
Open my heart and let it bleed onto yours
Feeding on fever, down on all fours
Show you what all the howling is for

Hey, hey, my playmate
Let me lay waste to thee
Burned down their hanging trees
It's hot, hot, hot, hot here
Got a curse we cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
There's a curse comes with a kiss
The bite that binds the gift that gives (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Now that we got gone for good
Writhing under your riding hood (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Tell your grandma and your mama too
It's true, true, true, true
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh23Embed
