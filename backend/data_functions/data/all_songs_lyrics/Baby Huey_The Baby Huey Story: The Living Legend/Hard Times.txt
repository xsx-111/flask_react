Hard Times Lyrics
Cold, cold eyes upon me they stare
People all around me and they're all in fear
They don't seem to want me but they won't admit
I must be some kind of creature up here having fits

From my party house, I'm afraid to come outside
Although I'm filled with love I'm afraid they'll hurt my pride
So I play the part I feel they want of me
And I pull the shades so I won't see them seein' me

Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times, in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found

From my party house I feel like meetin' others
Familiar faces, creed and race, a brother
But to my surprise I find a man corrupt
Although he be my brother, he wants to hold me up

Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times, in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
So many hard times...
Sleepin' on motel floors
Knockin' on my brother's door
Eatin' Spam and Oreos and drinkin' Thunderbird baby

In this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times, in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found


I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of payin' dues baby
And I'm sick and tired of havin' so many hard, hard times baby
And from my party house, from my party houseEmbed
