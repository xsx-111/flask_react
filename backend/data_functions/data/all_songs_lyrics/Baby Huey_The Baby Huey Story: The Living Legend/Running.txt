Running Lyrics
She's got me runnin', tryin' to find her
Like a diesel on tracks behind her
Though I know from me she wants to escape
Fool I am, I won't accept my fate
So I'm runnin', and I'm so tired
Can't stop now cause she's got such a headstart
Any day I know I'm steppin' to find
Another man holdin' what was mine
Still runnin'

They say love, can be so blind
And it can almost drive you out of your mind
Look at me, an educated fool
Loving this woman that's made me bloat my cool

So I'm runnin', tryin' to find her
Like a diesel on tracks behind her
Any day I know I'm steppin' to find
Another man holding what once was mine

Still runnin'
Tryin' to get somewhere
Still runnin' momma
Still runnin' baby
Still tryin' to get it together, somehow I know
Let me tell you one more time
They say love, can be so blind
And it can almost drive you out of your mind
Look at me, an educated fool
Lovin' this woman that's made me bloat my cool
So I'm runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'Embed
