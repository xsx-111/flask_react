Spoiled LyricsColour me in kindness
Cover me with love
I am blessed
You're burying your father
You're burying your son
You are dead
I know nothing of real pain
I'm a child and I am spoiled
I hate myself for my complaints
I'm pathetic and I'm bored
I cry simply at the thought
I crumble at the sight
If I ever had to
Feel I fall to my knees
Pray for God to save me
Feel I fall to my knees
Pray for God to save me
I have never been in love
I pretend to care
Convince myself that it's enough
I was never there
I am hiding in the dust
Sweep me underneath the chair
I have never been in love
I keep on giving
I keep on giving up
I keep on giving up
I keep on giving up
I keep on giving
I keep on giving up
I keep on giving up
I keep on giving up
I keep on giving1Embed
