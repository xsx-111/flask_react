Bad Apple LyricsBad apple
Why do I want more?
Skin so sweet
But you're
But you're rotten
To the core
To the core
To the core
I never learnt to truly burn
Bridges made in darker days
Bad apple
Why do I feel the need
To touch you
When I know you are not clean?
To the core
To the core
I never learnt to truly burn
Bridges made in darker
To the core
To the core
To the core
To the core
To the core
To the core
To the core
To the coreEmbed
