Whole LyricsLet it out
Tell me what you want me to hear
Push it out
Tell me that you still want me here
Deep inside this hole
I will offer you my soul
Waiting, hoping with each breath
That you will leave it in my chest
Lie to me
Lie to me
Make me see
Lie to me
Lie to me
Make me see
Deep inside this hole
I will offer you my soul
Waiting, hoping with each breath
That you will leave it in my chest
Lie to me
Lie to me
Make me see
Lie to me
Lie to me
Make me see4Embed
