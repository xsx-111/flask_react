The stars and me were speaking
They told me you were leaving
If jupiter is moving
Then maybe you should stay
Heaven doesn't know me
As much as you have shown me
Your happiness is happy
My envy is in rage
Turn low the radio
Silence resume again
Fly high the brightest light
Don't let me put you out
Green eyes on a blue-eyed child
Please can you stay a while?
Green eyes on a blue-eyed child
Please can you stay, stay?
Maybe I'll wait
Until my thoughts about you change
And the love that I once had returns againEmbed
