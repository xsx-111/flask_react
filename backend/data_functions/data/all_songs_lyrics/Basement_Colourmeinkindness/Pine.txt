Pine Lyrics
Special, I wish you were special
But I can't think of you that way
Want me, I need you to want me
I hate myself, but that's okay

Because I never have enough
I don't love you, I just need to be loved

Want me, I need you to want me
I hate myself, but that's okay

Because I never have enough
I don't love you, I just need to be loved

Want me, I need you to want me
I hate myself, but that's okay

Because I never have enough
I don't love you, I just need to be loved
I'm a liar, I'm a fake
Open up your chest
Let me throw your heart away4Embed
