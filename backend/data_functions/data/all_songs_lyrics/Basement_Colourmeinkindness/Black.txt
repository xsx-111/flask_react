Black LyricsI tell lies
If I didn't you'd be horrified
I'd rather die
Than have you find out
What I'm trying to hide
I can't escape
These walls I made
Surrounding me
Surrounding
Underground
Where creatures replace sight with sound
Leave me be
The darkness here is comforting
I can't escape
These walls I made
Containing me
Containing
Containing
Containing
Containing
Containing
