Covet Lyrics
When I'm with you, I don't wanna be with you

White hair and a hopeful smile
Your inside is on your outside
I need a pleasant surprise

Good heart and desire to please
I want a fatal disease

With you, I don't wanna be with you
When I'm with you, I don't wanna be with you

You are everything
My most demanding dream

Good heart and desire to please
I want a fatal disease

With you, I don't want to be with you
When I'm with you, I don't want to be with you
When I'm with you, I don't want to be with you
When I'm with you, I don't want to be with you7Embed
