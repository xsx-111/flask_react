Breathe LyricsSmile, like it was yesterday
Make me believe that you're the same
Speak, tell me that you're okay
I keep biting on my tongue
Looking at your face
As if we never made mistakes
Breathe, take in everything
Become a person that I hate
I'm looking at your face
As if we never, ever made mistakes
If I close my eyes long enough
Would I die?
Or would I just get lost?
You could find me if you care enough
But I'm hoping you don't
If I close my eyes for long enough
Would I die?
I cannot pretend I haven't tried
I am hoping that you don't find me2Embed
