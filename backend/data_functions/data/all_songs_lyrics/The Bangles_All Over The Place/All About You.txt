All About You LyricsYou were so amused when I made myself available
You had to ask if it was all intentional
Well, something's goin' on (on and on)
Something's goin' on (goin' on and on)
I am finding out all about you
The sun is hiding and the car is running badly
I-I know only one way a friend should kiss a friend goodbye
But, something's goin' on (on and on)
Something's goin' on (goin' on and on)
I am finding out all about you
I'm taking it all too hard I have nothing left to fight you with
All your pretty things are merely to create the myth
That something's goin' on (on and on)
Something's goin' on (goin' on and on)
I am finding out all about you
Yeah, something's goin' on (on and on)
Something's goin' on (going on and on and)
I am finding out all about you
Yeah, I am finding out all about youEmbed
