Silent Treatment LyricsTold her you'd forget
It hasn't happened yet
Oh oh oh, you want to know
She said nothing
Nothing, nothing
She said nothing
You'd wanna hear right now
What goes through your head
Better left unsaid, yeah
Oh oh oh, you want to know
She says nothing
Nothing, nothing
She says nothing
You'd got to hear right now
Nothing
Nothing, nothing
She says nothing
You got to hear right now
Yeah, nothing
Nothing, nothing
She says nothing
You got to hear right now
Yeah, nothing
Nothing, nothing
She says nothing
You got to hear right now, yeah nowEmbed
