Hero Takes a Fall LyricsThe hero is exposed when
His crimes are brought to the light of day
Won't be feeling sorry, sorry, sorry
On the judgement day
Wasn't it me who said
There'd be a price to pay
And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall
Your mother told you stories
You substitute with girls who tell you more
Suddenly your sycophants are chanting
Slogans at your door
We're seeing through you now
I saw it all before
And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Emotion is a virtue
For you it is the one fatal flaw
Sitting on your throne and drinking
Thinking she'll return your call
Every story's got an ending
Look out, here it comes, here it comes
And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ohEmbed
