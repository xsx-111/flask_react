Tell Me LyricsThrew away the things you loved
Now you want me to forgive you
Surprise surprise, I'm runnin' on
Yeah, I'm movin' on
What a shock it is to see
I can walk away so easily
Isn't it funny how hard it's turned out
This time I'm movin' on
Tell me...tell me
While I still have the time
Are ya gonna find a love
Thats truer than mine
One, two, three abandon me
Ain't no turning back again
Well too bad, baby, this time you lose
'Cause I'm movin' on
Tell me...tell me
While I still have the time
Are ya gonna find a love
That's truer than mine
One, two, three abandon me
Ain't no turning back again
Well too bad, baby, this time you lose
'Cause I'm movin' on
I'm movin' onEmbed
