More Than Meets the Eye Lyrics
He's got a slow, slow ride
Got a camera inside
He takes a picture, hangs it up to dry
And there's one girl named
And another disclaimed
All the time, you can't help feelin' ashamed

Given new reasons to survive
He keeps a number of them alive
There's a warning in the sky
A stranger passing by
And there's more than meets the eye to the guy

When you're so secure
Never feeling unsure
That's the time to check behind your door
'Cause there's one thing said
When another is meant
He's around, confusing you 'til the end

Seeing how changable you feel
Don't think this happiness is real
And it's hard to justify
The tangles you untie
There's more than meets the eye to the guyEmbed
