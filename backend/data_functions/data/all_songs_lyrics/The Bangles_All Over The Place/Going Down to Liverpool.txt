Going Down to Liverpool LyricsHey there...
Where you going with that load of nothing in your hand
I said: Hey there...
All through this green and pleasant land
I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing
I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing
I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
Hey there...
Where you going with that UB40 in your hand
I said: Hey there...
All through this green and pleasant land
I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing
I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing
I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
Hey now
Where you going with that UB40 in your hand
I said: Hey now
All through this green and pleasant land
I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing
I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing
All the days of my life
All the days of my life1Embed
