James Lyrics
I knew it'd turn out like this
I'm keeping one foot on the train
And I must be a masochist
To ever take up with you, James

It sounds familiar, that tone in your voice (Oh, oh)
You're gonna quit, James, you leave me no choice (Oh, oh)

Oh, James
Letting me down again, James

Well, it wasn't so long ago
I saw love in your eyes
And I think I should've known
But I'm feeling somewhat surprised

You think there's someone better for you (Oh, oh)
You think I'm too young to see this thing through (Oh, oh)

Oh, James
Letting me down again, James
Ooh, let me down, do-do (Down, down)
Ooh, let me down, do-do (Let me down, down, down, down)
Ooh, let me down, do-do (Down, down)
Ooh, let me down, do-do (Let me down, down, down, down)
Ooh, let me down, do-do (Down)

I knew it'd turn out like this
I'm keeping one foot out the door
And I don't think I should trust
That kind of love anymore

And now I realize I had it all wrong (Oh, oh)
I'll only take this trip for so long (Oh)

Woah, James
Letting me down again, James
Guess it's goodbye again, James
Letting me down again
Letting me down again, JamesEmbed
