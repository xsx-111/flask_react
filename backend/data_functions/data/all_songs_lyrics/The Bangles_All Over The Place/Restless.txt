Restless LyricsSaw your head turned a bit too far to the right now
Saw the eye go a little spark when she walks by now
But if you wanna love
You wanna love another girl
I'll leave it up to you
But I won't be tested
(You feel restless now)
While you feel restless (restless)
Now I'm wondering every time that you hold me
Well, should I question anything you have told me
But if you wanna love
You wanna love another girl
I'll leave it up to you
But I won't be tested
(You feel restless now)
While you feel restless (restless) yeah
I remember when you and I were a nation
I could trust you in any dark situation
But if you wanna love
You wanna love another girl
I'll leave it up to you
But I won't be tested
(You feel restless now)
While you feel restless (restless)Embed
