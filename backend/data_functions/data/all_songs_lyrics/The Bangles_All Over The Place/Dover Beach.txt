Dover Beach Lyrics
If I had the time
I would run away with you
To a perfect world
We'd suspend all that is duty or required

Late last night, you cried
And I couldn't come to you
But on the other side
You and I, inseparable and walking, yeah
Oh woah

We could steal away
Like jugglers and thieves
Or we could come and go, oh
And talk of Michaelangelo
Oh woah

If we had the time (If we had the time)
We had the time

The day you looked at me
Pain was on your mind
The world is no one's dream
We will never ever find the time
Oh woah
If we had the time
I would run away with you
To a perfect world
To a perfect worldEmbed
