Street Knowledge Lyrics
Made money, watch for the cops that go a hundred
Crazy summer, moved on up, fivers are on it
That or a shooter who I'm around, Larry Hoovers
Want a new block, these is the projects, let me screw you
Top of the day, thermometer hot, niggas'll shoot bruh
And be up, more gunshots than in Fallujah
Call it Chiraq, hundred G lines, no time to lie back
Want a Maybach, get a real junkie to test the product
Hold down your spot, warm up the pot, let it rock up
Stay on your grind, get that shit jumpin', start off with dimes
And on the weekdays, take twenty-five, give 'em all three bags
Within a week, you're gettin' money, the clich√©
Come through bumpin' your head and he say
They all say that he paid, and now people wonder what he made
And if you're weak, ay, can he be robbed? Beast
See now he gotta go Mobb Deep on me

Street knowledge, we puttin' these books to the test
We puttin' two to the chest for niggas who rock vests
Food for thought, spittin' out verbs for sport
In these streets you better walk the walk or come up short
Street knowledge, we puttin' these books to the test
We puttin' two to the chest for niggas who rock vests
Food for thought, spittin' out verbs for sport
In these streets you better walk the walk or come up short
Don't let your mouth get you oxed up, boxed up in the cage
On some bruja shit, bitches burning bundles of sage
Your crack rock too pure, they gonna set you up
Chain too big on your neck, they calling you King Tut
Trust no one whose sweat bands is narc IDs
And run for the hills if you hear anybody yell "Freeze"
Stash your cheese better, them shoeboxes don't work
That's some old school shit, like money in the mattress
Bitches is actresses, just screw 'em and leave
They fuck up your whole operation like Adam and Eve
Don't play the roof tops, change the color of your blue tops
And them baggies with the smiley faces? Get new stocks
You can't run in skinny jeans, serve fiends by any means
Sprinkle coke in the dust blunt to spice up your greens
This the school of street gems from your boy Tony Yano
You wanna check for it nigga? Slide across the Verrazano

Street knowledge, we puttin' these books to the test
We puttin' two to the chest for niggas who rock vests
Food for thought, spittin' out verbs for sport
In these streets you better walk the walk or come up short
Street knowledge, we puttin' these books to the test
We puttin' two to the chest for niggas who rock vests
Food for thought, spittin' out verbs for sport
In these streets you better walk the walk or come up short2Embed
