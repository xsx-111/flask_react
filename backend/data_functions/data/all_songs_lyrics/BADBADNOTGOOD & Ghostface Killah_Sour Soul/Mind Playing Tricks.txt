Mind Playing Tricks Lyrics
Evil emotions, it seems like my mind's playing tricks on me
I have vision of Gravediggaz doing mix for me
Sinister, I drive niggas off to the dark side
I set Ichabod Crane on his horse ride
Gave Krueger his clothes, killed the corpse, companion
You got no clue in the mystery, I'm the last one standing
Ghostface, the hockey mask hiding the features
Fuck the black lagoon, watch me enable her creatures
The bleach is chemistry, teachers cooking meth
I got a Meth in my clique, Johnny Blaze 'em to death
I'm no Heff I like bitches hardcore in the deuces
Run through red lights bitch, fuck ya period juices
I've been watching too many, I almost got away with it
These Snap' bitches is cray, almost gotta play with it
View Natural Born Killers on the daily basis
Murder cases, best advice is watch how my felony faces

Dangerous, lethal vocals enter the cranium
I got skeleton bones of titanium
Iron heart, black souls, I live for vengeance
It's the emotional details I leave in every sentence
Dangerous, lethal vocals enter the cranium
I got skeleton bones of titanium
Iron heart, black souls, I live for vengeance
It's the emotional details I leave in every sentence
Step back, click clack, my stacks of cash
Make Walter White look like I got the pure vocab
Dark specialist, Starky be the A1 chemist
The pure have your face all numb just like a dentist
Street client√®le I flip, buy and sell
Half the chains leaving marks on my neck, that ain't frail
Solid goes the charm like a newborn baby
Ten pounds or six ounces, the shit's looking crazy
Retarded, leaving niggas daily departed
Tried to sit but it started, it ain't for the weak-hearted
Heavily guarded, my clan keep prisoners of war
Torture niggas with the morphine drips of the raw
Peruvian white blowing dust in 'em, feeding 'em Seroquel
Fucking they minds up, blowing off the pedestal
My verbal technique I speak, I don't sweep
Make a bitch stash a nut in the cheek, or her ass cheek

Dangerous, lethal vocals enter the cranium
I got skeleton bones of titanium
Iron heart, black souls, I live for vengeance
It's the emotional details I leave in every sentence
Dangerous, lethal vocals enter the cranium
I got skeleton bones of titanium
Iron heart, black souls, I live for vengeance
It's the emotional details I leave in every sentenceEmbed
