Ray Gun Lyrics
Yo, yo
Back in black, it's your local superhero from the hood
Ironman Stark's got the good
Not that good good like Snoop, I bulletproofed the Coop'
Polished up the suit and gathered the troops
Got a brand new ray gun
Me and DOOM heading down to the range to shoot in the matrix
Catch bullets with my hands and teeth, I break faces
Wild car chases, don of all ages
I saved the world, that's fucking history pages
My Wu crescent shines in the sky at night
Watch how my eagle on my wrist take off into flight
All my might, white glass teeth that write
Ain't a bird or a plane it's a ghost on the mic
Two hammers and a diamond blade sword
Thicker than the Ford F-150, niggas couldn't lift me

As if, stance mad stiff
Metal Face DOOM, beware, he bear gifts
Cab for the shift, overwork, overtime
Jerk, you been warned, go for mine
In the dancehall, play the wall like handball
'Til his pants fall, brawl 'til last call
Loose cannon, squeeze drip
Off to rip this one for the Gipper, get gypped
That nig', ya dig? Don't tip the strippers
Foamposite mask, matching slippers
Yo, where's Starks? Backpack of ammo
Warriors said, "Let your flags blow", camo
These dudes is toys like Wham-O
Damn though, chip paint driving on the gravel with the Lambo
