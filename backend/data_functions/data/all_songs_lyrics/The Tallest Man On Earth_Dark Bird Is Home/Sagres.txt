Sagres LyricsWe were travellers, so blind
Went to where the world did end
Read of death in waves and out
So this is when we walked away
And this sadness, I suppose
Gonna hold me to the ground
Where I'm forced to find the still
In a place you won't be 'round
Was I ever part of knowing
With your hands in mine
Little screams into the wonder
And a wild set of rides
Come on
And so here I go again
Say I want my freedom, sure
But it's like end of all the dreams
Like in my life I needed more
And this madness, I suppose
Gonna haunt me with the line
That I could drink until I sleep
Through all scarier times
Was I ever part of knowing
With your hands in mine
Little screams into the wonder
And a wild set of rides
Come on
Now was I ever going to be more than these savages in me
As they will sing into silence, just to silence tears
Now what is left in here?
It's not the sting of cities flickering in life, no
It's not me knowing there's a deeper in the dust, no
It's not the reasoning with shadows that are gone, no
It's not me knowing I'm yet to see fire
It's just all this fucking doubt
Come on
And this silence, I suppose
Gonna hold me to the ground
Where I'm forced to find the still
In a place you won't be 'round6Embed
