Slow Dance LyricsAnd so to be one to lie to the captain
Sure I'm coming back
But I walk along and meet up a tree line
Cover up at last
And they're raging at the beach for some light
But like the birds I was given all this time
And to stop believing in the returning
I went on
So vaguely I still hear the bangs but not
What's going on
I guess they're raging at the beach for some light
But like the birds they're forgiven every time
But then I know that I'm a stranger in this land
And I wake you up by speaking what you cannot understand, no
All I said was there were mountains in my way
But they're slowly disappearing
And I balance when I feel you to my skin
In times like these even travelers can win
To be high in trees when they walk
Just forth and back and out
And the vessel's gone and I will stay to
Figure this one out
I bet they're raging in the seas for some light
And like all birds they're given all this time
And now I hold on fall is greeting me to stay
And we slow dance in the kitchen and I dream the days away, oh
And just like Lucinda's you are right on time
There are louder cities somewhere
But I don't think I'll be back where ringing stays
In a place like this I should never feel afraid
Get around
This is handsome life
I guess my rhythm grew
Through my darker time, oh
I was not the killer I was one just setting sail
With the fear of sideway winds just turning
Downward with the hail
Oh, I was raging in the field for some light
But like the birds I was forgiven with this time
And in this sunlight I just can't believe your face
We're some laundry line believers
We're just kids in many ways, oh
And you smell like smoke and honey in my arms
I'm somewhere in some falling and I'm learning of your language for to say
In times like these I should never grow away1Embed
