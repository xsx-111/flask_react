Timothy Lyrics
Suddenly the wide awake
And to get right in
Figure that the fear to try
Was the traveling

Deep into the Rockies then
Did the future sound
Timothy, we're waking up
To a healing mind

It only takes a gravel road
In Missouri light
Rolling to the way back when
Simple was alright

But mother, I can break the bank
With the pedal down
Timothy, we're waking up
To a healing mind

She said, "Why are you so complicated
When some time is the only giver?"
Remember Arizona kid
In the warrior house
I wonder if he's shaking still
He will be alright

Little are the things we learn
But we're making sound
Timothy, we're waking up
To a healing mind

We don't know many things
Believing is fine
When the moment is about to break into your home
It's a long ways to get it out, so we will go
Follow friendly like it knew what was before

She said, "Why are you so complicated
When some time is the only giver?"

It only takes a journalist
And the speed of light
Goes on about the drinks you shared
And what he'll never find
Brother, we just take it back
With the pedal down
Timothy, we're waking up
To a healing mind1Embed
