Seventeen LyricsYou're driving too fast
You pace like the crazies
And I can't hear what you say
You want to believe
But you are just guessing
But you always get away
Well if I wasn't only seventeen
Now stuck on the highway 'cause I feel
It's not where I was going
All these sixteen hundred miles
Went to see what's mine
In streets of the fading lines
It's still kinda warm
But seasons are changing
Where you stand and smoking them down
You look pretty cold
Yes, I'm always shaking
Can you hold me for a little while?
Well if I wasn't only seventeen
Now stuck on the highway 'cause I feel
It's not where I was going
All these sixteen hundred miles
Went to see what's mine
In streets of the fading lines
You call up all time
You have all these visions
And you're thirsty all around
Your heart goes too fast
Your legs are still shaking
Won't you come in for a while?
Well if I wasn't only seventeen
Now stuck on some highway 'cause I feel
It's not where I was going
All the sixteen hundred miles
But to see what's mine
In streets of the fading linesEmbed
