Beginners Lyrics"What do you want?" was never answered
Then some things were handed out
We got weird and fickle instructions but somehow we planned around
Oh, then we got all nervous, baby, I don't have the heart like you
And so we listened now if nature were just loud enough and ran
And I know I shouldn't be here, but I want to be your man
Oh, suddenly I'm lost but I just want to be a part of true
And then so suddenly we are gone
Looking out for some way
You and I, we belong on these wild and wonderful trails
You're just a singer wanting silence
I just have illegal thoughts
I will kill you if I take you but now this is not enough
Oh, there will be a moment when I ask you to believe in love
And I could probably be patient
But we just don't have a hell lot of time
It's getting light and I just want you in the night
Oh, we will all be caught and they won't let me hang around with you
Then so suddenly we are gone
Looking out for some way
You and I, we belong on these wild and wonderful trails
I could just leave tomorrow, but baby, letting you go
All these songs would be just of sorrow
And we have no idea but then what else do we know?
We let it out to let it ride
And we are winners going out there
As we're stealing dreamy thoughts
They will heal you when you find them
And it's never just enough
Oh, then we get all nervous, baby
I don't have a plan, do you?
Oh, so suddenly we are gone
Looking out for some way
You and I, we belong on these wild and wonderful trails
I could just leave tomorrow, but baby, letting you go
All these songs would be just of sorrow
And we have no idea but then what else do we know?
We let it out, to let it ride
To let it rideEmbed
