Darkness of the Dream LyricsAnd so I'd stumble in the light
The night was always there
To end all repetition
Insane? I bother with the blinds
Carry on and love will be here
I met this girl from my old town
But sadly she could see
I'm still a bunch of memories
And shit that I believe
And suddenly the rain
Is the only part you feel
And there's the darkness of the dream
And there's the darkness of the dream
But she was something of a flame
Just telling me to quiet
Excuses and the visions
Just let yourself out of your sight
Careless and some love will be here
And now you sleep and get some rest
From all the songs you make
They're all a bunch of mirrors
And fuck it, I'm afraid
That suddenly the rain
Is the only part you feel
And there's the darkness of the dream
And there's the darkness of the dream
She said, "I ain't got no time for no broken believers
And lie like the foolish one
It's taking hours and days and I just want to hold you
An end of a wait begun"
I said I think of hours in everyone
The letting go is here and now
The beauty is in your arms
No mind is out to wander
Just let yourself out of your sight
Careless and some love will be there
And now there's this dancer in the dream
Just rowing in the night
And I can't believe how pretty
And I can't believe the signs
When suddenly the rain
Is the only part you feel
And there's a darkness of the dream
And there's a darkness of the dream
A fear of heart and all of its turnings
And it's never letting go
I'm sure I'll sleep when all this goes under
But now, will I sleep alone?
It only starts with a river
But I know it's only waiting for the golden ground
It's wide and awake
But I'm showing up late
On the way there was something
That told me to stay
I feed on the sunlight
But sunlight just drives me away
In the loving game
The summer is deep
And the memories still
The garden is full
And I'm way over hills
I see there's a line that I'm walking
And I'm just the same
It's an endless game
In the darkness of the dream2Embed
