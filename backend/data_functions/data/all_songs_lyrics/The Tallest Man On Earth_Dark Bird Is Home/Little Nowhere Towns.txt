Little Nowhere Towns Lyrics"So this is what I can believe" is what I said to my friend I can recall
I must have been pretty gone when I went through these towns like a cannonball
And I've already grown up here, here I might as well grow down
No it's shaky, built in fury, think this wind's going to settle down
Carolina, why are we going with this around?
It's all silvery, dear, it's the light of little nowhere towns
But the treasure we had was so big and we sunk through the earth and believe how slow
Sun wasn't out for a week and the weekend you said there's just none to show
And I barely can remember little feet on solid ground
And the drinking part is useless when you buried away from sounds
Carolina, where are you ending up this time?
Say it's silvery, dear, like the light of little nowhere towns
Well so honestly I'm broken down by this emptiness I feel
First you moan and then you yell it
Now we don't answer across the street
And I'm racing through my pockets now 'cause I'm starting to believe
Selling emptiness to strangers a little bit warmer than my dreams
"Oh, this is what I should believe" is what I said to my friend I can recall
I must have been pretty cold when I went through this house like a cannonball
And I barely can remember asking you through all this time
It's all shaky, built in fury like this wind's going to settle down
Carolina, where are we going to be found?
You're all silvery, dear, you're the light of little nowhere towns3Embed
