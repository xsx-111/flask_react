Dark Bird Is Home Lyrics

And so there were no higher mountains
It's all in your hand
Valley was a future sea
And now sail is the plan
And in this travel with no journey
I lose 'til I'm light
Letting go of mind to have
What I'm keeping now

And suddenly the day gets you down
But this is not the end, no, this is fine
We're still the towers in the valley
Still winds down this dream
Still we're in the light of day
With our ghosts within

And there are many ways of sorrow
For just stepping out
Everyday a growling storm
But they're kind somehow
I fall in love but keep on falling
I held you for life
But letting go rope in hand
There’s just leaving now
And suddenly the day gets you down
But this is not the end, no, this is fine
Still we're biking, laugh in memories
Still winds down the stream
Still we're in the light of day
With our ghosts within

And when there’s no one on the bottom
You got there alone
Kicking up some dust to see
Where a wind could blow
And all the ways to ride a lightning
I've used up a few
And I just want you to be safe
As I thunder through

And suddenly the day gets you down
But this is not the end, no, this is fine
We're still the towers in the valley
Still winds down this dream
Still we're in the light of day
With our ghosts within
No, this is not the end and no final tears
That we need to show
I thought that this would last for a million years
But now I need to go
Oh, fuck
