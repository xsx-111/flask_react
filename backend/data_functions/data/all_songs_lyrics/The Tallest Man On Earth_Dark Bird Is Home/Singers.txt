Singers Lyrics
Oh, will you walk or slowly run
Sweet old man, it is time
Disappear, but still there is laughter
I'm in the shadows being you
Graying hair, random blues
Guess there'll always be someone after

Guess we're always in beginnings of our wildness to return
We rise into it and we feel a little lighter
Guess we're always in the question of the things we never learn
But we're only gone, like singers are
Till springtime let them out
If they shall let them out
No?

Some said the night is here so sleep
But if they knew the way
How a weather builds in the silence
It's where you try it's gonna land
It's where you land it will try
Guess it all looks just like we're dancing

Guess we're only in beginnings of our silence to return
I rise above it and I feel a little lighter
Guess we're always in destruction of the little things we'd learnt
But we're only gone, like singers are
Till springtime Let them out
If they should let them out
No?
And in the morning we'll row out and see what's down there, oh
We cannot empty out this lake before I die
We let them back when it just felt like we were stealing, oh
But we're only gone, like singers are
Till springtime let them out
If they should let them out
No?

I'm going to miss you now, alright
Guess I walk it somehow
Travel on to feel what is out there
It's on the borders you will think
Just of all these goodbyes
And the memories of being looked after

Guess we're only in beginnings of our wildness to return
I rise into it and I feel a little lighter
Guess we're always in the faces of the things we never learn
But we're only gone, like singers are
Till springtime let them out
If they should let them out
No?2Embed
