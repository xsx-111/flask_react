Fields of Our Home LyricsSo you honestly believe in me
Though I wake up every night, oh
And I've been dreaming of a second rush
While the first one leaves your eye
What if you'd never been through lies
Young sorrow, wailing loans
What if you'd never seen through that
To the fields of our home
Always rumors of a flame in town
Not by parents ever traced, no
Just a part of what we do out here
Subtle early, vicious late
What if I'd never been through finds
Of sorrow, wailing loans
What if I'd never seen through that
To the fields of our home
When all falling down is just the travelling need
Of a wave
And the burn of salt in the cuts come around
Heal again
There was always racing on that crossing street
Where you'd land on quiet heels
Will there ever be a sane time to
Let them know how walking feels
What if we never see through crying tomorrows
Wailing loans
What if we never see through that
To the fields of our
The more we believe in these frozen grounds
Suddenly hunger disappears
Will we fall as we run with our closing eyes
Is this a lifetime or some years?Embed
