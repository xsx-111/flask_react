Kick It Out LyricsOut of the street, you better get on home
Tail shaking filly running on her own
They say she got loose on the night she was born
Cranking it up in a school zone
Kick it out
Come on, kick it out
She said kick out your motor and drive while you're still alive
Kick it out
Sitting in a bar in a seaside town
Sweet little love getting high, getting down
Well, sailors see her running along the beach
Laugh and jump out of reach
Wild music blowing in her mane
She needs a bareback rider, won't give her no pain
A hard racy game of give and take
She never plays half-crazed in her wake
Kick it out
She said kick it out.  Come on, come on
Kick out your motor and drive while you're still alive
Kick it out
Oooh, yeah.  Kick it out
Come on, kick out your motor and drive while you're still alive
Kick it out.  Woo!
(Guitar solo)
Ooooooh, she said kick it out
Ah, kick out your motor and drive while you're still alive
Kick it out
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh
Kick out your motor and drive while you're still alive
Kick it out
Oooh.  Oooh, oooh, yeahEmbed
