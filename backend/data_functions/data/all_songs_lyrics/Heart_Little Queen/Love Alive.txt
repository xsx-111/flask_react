Love Alive LyricsThe sky was dark this morning
When I raised my head
I stood at the window- darkness was my bane
Suddenly a sunbeam arch
Thrilled me to my weary heart
It was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen
I knew I had to keep my love
Keep my love alive
Keep my love- keep my love alive
Baby I want you to roll me
Hold me in your love
No more habits, promises and jive
Ever since I was a baby girl
Wanted one thing most in this world
It was to keep my love- keep my love alive
Yeah, got to keep my love- keep my love alive
Keep my love- keep my love alive

You're up there under the spotlight
Your silver trophy shines
With all you got, my lord! you must get high
You need a whole lot more than money
You need more than to survive
You gotta keep your love
Keep your love alive!
Oo, you got to keep your love, keep your love alive
Keep your love now, keep it alive1Embed
