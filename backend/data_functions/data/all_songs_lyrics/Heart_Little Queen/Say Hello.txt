Say Hello LyricsI'd like to know when you will say hello
When will it be I'd like to see you know
When will you change your mind and say hello?
Something is sending all sensations high
Someone is calling clearly to you now
Look for the one who will not say good-bye
Say hello
Say hello
Say hello to all your secret light inside
Build up your fire, take a ride I know
There'll be a night when you won't want to hide
Say hello
Say helloEmbed
