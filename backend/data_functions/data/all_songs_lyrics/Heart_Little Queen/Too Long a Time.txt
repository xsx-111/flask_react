Too Long a Time LyricsMomma says she doesn't want me hang'n around
Whatever you do now, don't let momma know
I slip out in the darkness, in the frosty moonlight
Fly across the silver morning meadow
Candle in the window
Shadow on the shade
I know my love lies waitin' inside
Close the door now
Have a taste of wine
Lord it's been too long a time
Oh, yes it has
Way down in the passing love
Feels so young and fine
Wrap your love around me
The wind is high
Every minute passing, I want to hold you
Every minute comes too long a time…
Too long a time…
Too long a timeEmbed
