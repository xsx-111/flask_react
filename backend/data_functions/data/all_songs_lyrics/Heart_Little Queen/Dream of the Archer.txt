Dream of the Archer LyricsWayfaring warrior soul- still wild
The archer stands
Arrow measured to the goal- sing of
Strong and living man
In his mind there is a vision wand'ring
Through the forest town
Telling of riches only given if through the woods
The way is found
Crying 'ah! beautiful dancers.. wake up
From your sleep!
Ahh! gentle romancers.. drink of love so sweet!'
Treasure glowing in their eyes- forest deepens
Dark their dream
'Keep to the pathways,' he advised, 'the woods are
More than they might seem'
I'd heed you now the apparition bending never ending
Sounds
Calling you away to a mystery- are your eyes
Not sparkling now?'
Sighing 'ahh, take you no warning- make no
Foolish fight
Ahh, think not of morning- lie here
Through the night'
'Beauty take us!' they call 'in my arms!'
They hear her say
As the silken web falls- mist illusion rips away
'Helpless! helpless!' now they scream
Helpless on the path he stands
And awakens from his dream singing string
Beneath his hand
Gentle archer ages old- release the aim
Free the goal
Roll your arrow to my soul- release the aim
Free the goalEmbed
