Katie Cruel Lyrics
Well when I first came to town
They called me the roving jewel
Now they've changed their tune
They call me Katie Cruel

And when I first came to town
They bought me drinks a'plenty
Now they've changed their tune
Hand me the bottles empty

And if I was where I would be
Then I'd be where I am not
Here I am where I must be
Where I would be, I cannot
Oh diddle aye, hum diddle aye, diddle ay

Through the woods I am going
Down through the boggy mires
Straightway down the road
And to my heart's desire

And if I was where I would be
Then I'd be where I am not
Here I am where I must be
Where I would be, I cannot
Oh diddle aye, hum diddle aye, diddle ay
Well when I first came to town
They called me the roving jewel
Now they've changed their tune
They call me Katie Cruel

And when I first came to town
They bought me drinks a'plenty
Now they've changed their tune
Hand me the bottles empty

And if I was where I would be
Then I'd be where I am not
Here I am where I must be
Where I would be, I cannot
Oh diddle aye, hum diddle aye, diddle ayEmbed
