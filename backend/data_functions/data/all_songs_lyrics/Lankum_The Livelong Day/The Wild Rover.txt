The Wild Rover Lyrics
I've been a wild rover for many's a year
And I've spent half me money drinking strong ale and beer
But now for the future I must take better care
In case that misfortune might come to my share

Wild rovin' I'll give it over
Wild rovin' give o'er
And I never will be called the
Wild rover no more

I went into an alehouse I used to resort
And I told the landlady that my money was short
When she heard of my story, oh her answer twas "nay"
Sayin' "Custom such as yours I could have any day"

Wild rovin' I'll give it over
Wild rovin' give o'er
And I never will be called the
Wild rover no more

I put my hand in my pocket, some money to find
And I pulled out the full of my two fists five times
When she saw I had the money
And money galore
When she saw I had the money
Well she called me her stór
Saying "I have the whiskey and wines of the best
All the words I have spoken, they were only in jest"
Wild rovin' I'll give it over
Wild rovin' give o'er
And I never will be called the
Wild rover no more

If I had half the money I left in your care
It would buy me ten acres and my family rear
It would thatch me a cottage, it would build me a barn
It would buy me a coat fur to keep my back warm

Wild rovin' I'll give it over
Wild rovin' give o'er
And I never will be called the
Wild rover no more
