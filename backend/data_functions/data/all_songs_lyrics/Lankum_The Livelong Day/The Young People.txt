The Young People LyricsOh, the day that they found him swinging
A day they'll not soon forget
Four long years ago
It can't be over yet
His tongue was tasting the morning
His feet were ringing a bell
Five times on the ropes
And six times that he fell
When the young people dance
They do not dance forever
It is written in sand
With the softest of feathers
It is not writ in stone
Like the walls of the chapel
And soon it is gone
Like the soft winters apple
Fly on your wings like an eagle
Fly like the heroes of old
Half your life ago
Your hands are turning cold
When the young people dance
They do not dance forever
It is written in sand
With the softest of feathers
It is not writ in stone
Like the walls of the chapel
And soon it is gone
Like the soft winters apple
When the young people dance
They do not dance forever
It is written in sand
With the softest of feathers
It is not writ in stone
Like the walls of the chapel
And soon it is gone
Like the soft winter's apple
When the young people dance
They do not dance forever
It is written in sand
With the softest of feathers
It is not writ in stone
Like the walls of the chapel
And soon it is gone
Like the soft winters apple
When the young people dance
They do not dance forever
It is written in sand
With the softest of feathers
It is not writ in stone
Like the walls of the chapel
And soon it is gone
Like the soft winters appleEmbed
