Early LyricsWell, her old friend, from her own end of town
Dropped by today
And way down deep inside me something died
When he came 'round to see her that way
Here it comes again, that same old chilly wind
Will blow like a cold winter squall
And I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall
And I'll be drinking again and thinking whenever he calls
There's a storm coming on
It won't be too long 'til the snow falls
Oh I'll be sober some
But when October comes and goes and no time at all
I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall
Oh, how quick they slip away
Here today and gone tomorrow
Love and seasons never stay
Bitter winds are sure to follow
Now there's no doubt, it's gonna be cold out tonight
I've shivered all day and when I look in her eyes
Needing to hold her so tight, she just looks away
Oh, she'll swear that it's true, he's just someone she knew
Long ago and I'll know that's not all
And I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall
Oh, I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fallEmbed
