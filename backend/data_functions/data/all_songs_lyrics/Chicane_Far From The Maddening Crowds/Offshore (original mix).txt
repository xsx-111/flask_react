Offshore (original mix) LyricsI, feel in my mind
I've got to let go
I've got to unwind
I, need a good time
I need to find love
I've got to get high
You've got the passion
To feel inside
A little love, a little life
Now you decide
There ain't no reasons
That we can't share
A little love, a little life
Can take us there
You've got the instincts
And now you know
A little love, a little life
Will let it show
Just take a hold
Of what you feel
A little love, a little life
Will make it real
I, feel in my heart
I want to let go
And make a new start
I, have got to break free
I've got to unwind
I've got to believeEmbed
