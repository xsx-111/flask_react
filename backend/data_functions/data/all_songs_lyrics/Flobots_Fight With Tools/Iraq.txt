Iraq Lyrics
Do you think the U.S. forces should have moved into Baghdad?
No
There would have been a U.S. occupation of Iraq
Once you took down Saddam Hussein's government, what are gonna put in its place?
It's uhh, it's a quagmire

Imagine
Rewind
Analyzed Quotations
I Rally All Quarters
Increase Resistance
Anticipation
Question Intelligence Rarely Actionable
Quiz International Relatives
Applicable Quips Interrupt Radio Accounts
Quiet
Initiate Rounds
All Qualified Innocents Report
Activate Quickly Increase Rewards
Astonishing Quantities, Immediate Resources (Affordable Quality Insurance)
Rapid Assurances
Queries Into Relevance
Audiences Quelled Into Red-bloodedness
Antiwar Quibbling Irks Rowdy Americans Quintessential Ignorance
Rinsed Airwaves
Que Incredible
Right-wing Allegiance
Cue

It’s Really A Quagmire
It’s Really A Quagmire
It’s Really A Quagmire
It’s Really A Quagmire
(It’s Really A Quagmire)

It Rages
Annually
Quarterly
Innocents Ricocheted
Accordingly Queasiness Infiltrates
Reforming Attitudes
Quite Interesting
Reactors Absent
Quarantine Idiotic Reckless Authorities
Quorum Is Reached
And Quest Isn’t Really Accomplished
Quadrennial Intentions? Run, Abscond Quick
Into Response A Quixotic Insistence
Resolving All Quandaries In Ridiculousness
And Quid pro quo Influx Reservists
Assignment: Quash Insurgents
Resurgence
Activists, Quakers Instigate Rallies
Advocating Quitting Instantly
Representatives Apprehensive
Quiescence Ineffectual
Refugee Accrual
Quicksand Invites Removal
Amputees Quadruple
Infidels Resuscitate Al Qaeda

It’s Really A Quagmire
It’s Really A Quagmire
It’s Really A Quagmire
It’s Really A Quagmire
And the question for the President
Was how many additional dead Americans was Saddam really worth?
The answer was not very many

It’s Really A Quagmire
It’s Really A Quagmire
It’s Really A Quagmire
It’s Really A Quagmire1Embed
