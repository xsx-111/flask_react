Combat Lyrics
No known beat that can keep me lonely
No known beat that can keep me lonely
No known beat that can keep me lonely
No known beat that can keep me lonely
No known beat that can keep me lonely
No known beat that can keep me lonely
No known beat that can keep me lonely
No known beat that can keep me lonely
No known beat that can keep me lonely
No known beat that can keep me lonely
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
No known beat that can keep me lonely
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
No known beat that can keep me lonely
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
No known beat that can keep me lonely
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
No known beat that can keep me lonely
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
No known beat that can keep me lonely
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
No known beat that can keep me lonely
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
No known beat that can keep me lonely
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
No known beat that can keep me lonely
I know how to rip a mic different, I grip it like so
Tight like kryptonite with a bike pole
Sparks from my lips ignite liquid nitro
No telling if it might blow
The environment's gotta be hotter than solder inside the iron
Zinc vitamins hide 'em inside when I'm writing the rhymes
It's hard to keep property guarded because of these pirates
And I motivate, no debate
We're taking it over, make no mistake
You're fake and there's no escape, 'cause you got caught
Frozen waiting for the crosswalk
I can take you to another level
Where the bass is above the treble
And your face is in double, evasiveness doesn't settle it
A place and a space where there's nothing to meddle with

Combat to get you to bomb back
Combat to get you to bomb back
Combat to get you to bomb back
Combat to get you to bomb back

Lyrical combat to get you to bomb back
Blonde, black, let's get beyond that
Sing songs that attack with strong raps
3-2-1, contact
Sans paddle, we swim the long laps
Swans flap to get the pond packed
Want sass? Kiss my mom's ass
Wrong tact, convict you en masse
Take it back like Linda Ronstadt
Or Luke Sky, with a twisted long hat
Tauntaun fat, subsisting on that
Tom tom, high-hat
Insist upon that, listen to Jon rap
This is combat to get you to bomb back
Two-fisted contact to get the pond packed
'Cause I'm on some shit that exists beyond that
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
(Combat to get you to bomb back)
