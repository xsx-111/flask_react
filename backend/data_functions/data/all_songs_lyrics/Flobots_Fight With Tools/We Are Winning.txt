We Are Winning Lyrics
Rival gangsters sit down to plan an after-school program
A religious fanatic posts footage of an interfaith service project
A group of teenage boys watches a video
Of a father playing catch with his son
An adult film star paints thumbnail portraits of elderly couples
Fully clothed and smiling
A record executive records a demo of his apology
A policeman makes reverse 911 calls
Instructing residents to take to the streets
A patriot reports for duty
She's wearing an orange jumpsuit and holding a picket sign
She's ashamed of her birthplace, but retreat is not an option

Women and children, frontline, log on, tune in, stand and be counted
Wounded, stationed, in the belly of the vulture
Watch your back, there's no civilians
Women, children, frontline, listen
Consider this a distant, early warning
The fire's imminent, pollution, gathering dust particles
Funneling through smokestacks, airwaves, bandwidth
Disinformation tube-fed, check the labels
Delete the virus - alert the masses!

Butterfly wing crosswinds, send Black Hawks toward hurricane survivors
Roses sprout from empty lots and sidewalk cracks
Pacifist guerrillas move undetected through concrete jungles
New forms are beginning to take shape
Once-occupied minds are activating
People are waking up! The insurgency is alive and well
Rise of the Flobots; portrait of the new American insurgent
Rattle and shake the foundations of the world order
Assembly line consent, resist, refuse, inform
Create, direct loved ones to the trenches
Suit up, forge rubble into fortresses
Plaster, cloth, aluminum, broken porcelain
Rusted platinum, burn bloodstains from decompressed diamonds
Hammer the battlecry into braille-studded armor

We are building up a new world, do not sit idly by
Do not remain neutral, do not rely on this broadcast alone
We are only as strong as our signal
There is a war going on for your mind
If you are thinking, you are winning
Resistance is victory, defeat is impossible
Your weapons are already in hand
Reach within you and find the means by which to gain your freedom
Fight with tools!
Your fate, and that of everyone you know, depends on it2Embed
