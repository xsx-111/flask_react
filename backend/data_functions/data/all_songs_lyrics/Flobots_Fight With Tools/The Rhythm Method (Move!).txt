The Rhythm Method (Move!) Lyrics
How come you have three guitars?

3... 2... 1...
Liftoff, jetpack shoot into space
Represent the Dot 'til we're blue in the face
Fre-fre-fresher than tooth-a-paste
You know how we do in the place
The crowd accumulates when he's tuning the bass
The fiddle and guitar are removed from the case
You know it's Kenny O when it booms and shakes
You know it's our music by the movement it makes
The crowd that it draws, the yearning you get to prove what it takes

(Move!)
Throw your body on the dance floor
Whether you're beginner or advanced or (Move!)
Whatever you're doing it's okay - like this
So everyone do it your own way - like this (Move!)
Like the dude from Chappelle's Show  (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
Let it rip like velcro (F-L-O-B-O-T-S) (Move!)
We spit non-typical flows - like this (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
Mile High City and it goes like this (F-L-O-B-O-T-S) (Move!)
Like this, like this, 3-2-1-4-5-6
No telling where the beat might hit
This is out of hand like Buster Bluth
Leave you sounding like Rusted Root
Rots out your mouth like a busted tooth
Attention we paying who
Exempt Artax like Atreyu dude
Staying smooth venue we playing move
When you hear the Rabbit saying to
Let 5 explain it to you

Turn to the next page when I say
And follow along like A to the B to the C
Seven piece band you gotta see to believe
Make you jump around like you needed to pee
Make noise if you wanted me to proceed
Scream like Chewbacca, off your rocker
Drink a little vodka, link Iraq, Osama
Democracy, Barack Obama
Arabic for no war with Vietnam
And it don't stop, won't quit, so, slick

(Move!)
Throw your body on the dance floor (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
Whether you're beginner or advanced or (Move!) (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
Whatever you're doing it's okay - like this (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
So everyone do it your own way - like this (Move!) (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
Sweat got your pants warm (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
{*scratching sounds*} Transform (Move!)  (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
Wiggle and shake to this song - like this (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
Mile High City and it's on - like this (Move!) (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
Like this, like this, 1-2-3-4-5-6
Who's ready for some more hype shit?
This is rap's last stop like Castle Rock
The 'Bots blast off like an astronaut
I suppose we came to get started
Throw them bows like some angry archers
Our delivery's pedigree headed for the charts soon
Hit you in the heart like a harpoon
Like the chambers of the Wu-Tang Clan
Flobots got that Method, Man
(Move!) Wanna hang with the orangutans?
Mass appeal, massive bananas in hand
Kenny O got the master plan
To move your body like an ampersand
This rhythm section'll rattle the stands
Rip sheets like we battled the Klan
Average bands traffic the median
We stay in the lane like we're Superman

(Move!)
Throw your body on the dance floor
Whether you're beginner or advanced or (Move!)
Whatever you're doing it's okay - like this
So everyone do it your own way - like this (Move!)
Give it to you unprotected (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
Cause the rhythm is the method (F-L-O-B-O-T-S) (Move!)
Get ready to get loud (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
Mile High City spell it out  (F-L-O-B-O-T-S)
(Move!)
F-L-O-B-O-T-S
F-L-O-B-O-T-S (Move!)
F-L-O-B-O-T-S
F-L-O-B-O-T-S (Move!)
F-L-O-B-O-T-S
F-L-O-B-O-T-S (Move!)
F-L-O-B-O-T-S
F-L-O-B-O-T-SEmbed
