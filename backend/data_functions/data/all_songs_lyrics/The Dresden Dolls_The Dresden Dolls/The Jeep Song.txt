The Jeep Song LyricsI've been driving around town
With my head spinning around
Everywhere I look I see
Your '96 jeep cherokee
You're a bully and a clown
You made me cry and put me down
After all that I've been through
You'd think I'd hate the sight of you
But with every jeep I see
My broken heart still skips a beat
I guess it's just my stupid luck
That all of Boston drives that same black fucking truck
It could be him or am I tripping
And I'm crashing into everything
And thinking about skipping town a while
Until these cars go out of style...
I try to see it in reverse
It makes the situation hundreds of times worse
When I wonder if it makes you want to cry
Every time you see a light blue Volvo driving by
So don't tell me that you're off to see the world
I know you won't get very far
Don't call me if you get another girl baby
Just call me if you get another car
It could be him?
Or am I tripping?
It could him?
The number of them is insane
Every exit's an exboyfriend memory lane
Every major street's a minor heart attack
I see a red jeep and I want to paint it black
It could be him or am I tripping
And I'm crashing into everything
I can't wait til you trade the damn thing in
By then they will have put me in the looney bin
It could be him my heart is pounding
It's just no use I'm surrounded
But someday I'll steal your car and switch the gears
And drive that Cherokee straight off this trail of tearsEmbed
