Truce LyricsYou can have Washington, I'll take New Jersey
You can have London but I want New York City
I should get Providence, I've got a job now
Los Angeles - obvious - that's where you belong now
You can have Africa, Asia, Australia
As long as you keep your hands off Cafe Pamplona
We can split Germany right down the middle
You'd hate it there, anyway
Take Berlin and we'll call it even
You can have all of the carry-on baggage
I'll trade the Saskia jokes for the alphabet language
And special occasions weâ€™ll split between parents
Who forced us to hate them on alternating weekends
You call it over and I call you psycho
Significant other?
Just say we were lovers and we'll call it even
We'll call it even
I am the Ground Zero, ex-friend you ordered
Disguised as a hero to get past your borders
I know when I'm wanted I'll leave if you ask me to
Mind my own business and speak when I'm spoken to
I am the tower around which you orbited
I am not proud I am just taking orders
I fall to the ground within hours of impact
I hit back when hit
And attack when attacked
You get Route 2 between Concord and Lexington
I want Mass. Ave. from the Square to my apartment
And if we should meet through some misunderstanding
I'll be very sweet, very patient and forgiving
(Now get off my side of the state)
And if we should see one another in passing
Despite these techniques there is sometimes no avoiding
(There must be some kind of mistake)
We'll raise high our white flags and bow heads and shake hands
Declaring the land we're on un-American
We'll call it even
We'll call it even
I am the tower around which you orbited
I am not proud I am just taking orders
I fall to the ground within hours of impact
I hit back when hit
And attack when attacked
And I am an accident waiting to happen
I'm laughing like mad as you strangle the captain
My place may be taken, but make no mistake
From a little black box I can say without shame
That you've lost
That you've lost
Do you know what you've lost?
So take whatever you'd like
I'll strike like the States on fire
You won't sleep very tight
No hiding
No safe covers
Make your bed and now lie
Just like you always do
You can fake it for the papers but I'm onto you
I'm onto you
So take whatever you'd like
I'll strike like the States on fire
You won't sleep very tight
No hiding
No safe covers
Make your bed and now lie
Just like you always do
You can fake it for the papers but I'm onto you
I'm onto you
I'm onto you
I'm onto youEmbed
