Gravity LyricsGravity plays favorites I know it cause I saw
Honest to god, officer, it's awful
Down at work I'm getting too familiar with the floor
Trading in my talents by the mouthful
Hate to break it to you but it's out of my control
Forces go to work while we are sleeping
If I could attack with a more sensible approach
Obviously that's what I'd be doing...right?
Someone tell her, someone get her up
Now
Necks are cracking sideways
Hit me from the back side
I am on the white side
You are on the black side
Cut a piece that's bite size
Shoot me from my good side
If you got a straight line
This would be a good time
Gravity works slowly if you notice it at all
Some of us are getting mighty lucky (aren't we?)
If you had to live with this you'd rather lie than fall
You think I can't fly?
Well you just watch me, watch me
Someone tell her, someone get her up
Necks are cracking sideways
Hit me from the back side
I am on the thin side
You are on the fat side
Cut a piece that's bite size
Shoot me from my bad side
If you want a straight line
This'd be a good time
The sky is always falling down on me
The sky is always falling down on me
The sky is always falling down on me
So officer, forgive me please!Embed
