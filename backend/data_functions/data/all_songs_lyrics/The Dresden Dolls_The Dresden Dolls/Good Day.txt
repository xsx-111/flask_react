Good Day LyricsSo you don't want to hear about my good song?
And you don't want to hear about how I am getting on
With all the things that I can get done
The sun is in the sky and I am by my lonesome
So you don't want to hear about my good day?
You have better things to do than to hear me say
God its been a lovely day! Everything's been going my way
I took out the trash today and I'm on fire...
So you don't want to hear about my good friends?
You don't have the guts to take the truth or consequence
Success is in the eye of the beholder
And it's looking even better over your cold shoulder
I'm not suggesting you get to line me up for questioning
But, Jesus, think about the bridges you are burning
And I'm betting
That even though you knew it from the start
You'd rather be a bitch than be an ordinary broken heart
So go ahead and talk about your bad day...
I want all the details of the pain and misery
That you are inflicting on the others
I consider them my sisters and I want their numbers
God its been a lovely day! Everything's been going my way
I took up croquet today and I'm on fire
I picked up the pieces of my broken ego
I have finally made my peace as far as you and me go
But I'd love to have you up to see the place
And I'd like to do more than survive, I'd like to rub it in your face.....
Hey! It's been a lovely day! Everything's been going my way
I had so much fun today and I'm on fire
God, it's been a lovely day everything's been going my way
Ever since you went away hey I'm on fire.....
I'm on fire...
I'm on fire...
I'm on fire...
I'm on...
I'm on fire...
I'm on fire...
I'm on fire...
I'm on...
So you don't want to hear about my good day?1Embed
