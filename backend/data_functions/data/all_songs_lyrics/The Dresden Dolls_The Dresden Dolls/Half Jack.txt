Half Jack LyricsHalf underwater
I'm half my mother's daughter
A fraction's left up to dispute
The whole collection
Half off the price they're asking
In the halfway house of ill repute
Half accidental
Half pain full instrumental
I have a lot to think about
You think they're joking?
You have to go provoke him...
I guess it's high time you found out
It's half biology and half corrective surgery gone wrong
You'll notice something funny if you hang around here for too
Long ago in some black hole before they had these pills to take it back
I'm half Jill
And half Jack
Two halves are equal
A cross between two evils
It's not an enviable lot
But if you listen
You'll learn to hear the difference
Between the halfs and the half nots
And when I let him in I feel the stitches getting sicker
I try to wash him out but like they say, the blood is thicker
I see my mother in my face
But only when I travel
I run as fast as I can run
But Jack comes tumbling after
And when I'm brave enough and find a clever way to kick him out
And I'm so high not even you and all your love could bring me down
On 83rd he never found the magic words to change this fact:
I'm half Jill
And half Jack
I'm halfway home now
Half hoping for a showdown
Cause I'm not big enough to house this crowd
It might destroy me
But I'd sacrifice my body
If it meant I'd get the Jack part out
See! Jack! Run! Jack! Run!
Jack! See! Jack! See!
Jack! Run! Jack! Run!
Jack! See! Jack! See!
Jack! Run! Jack! Run!
Jack! See! Jack! See!
Jack! Run! Jack! Run!
Jack! Run! JACK! RUN!1Embed
