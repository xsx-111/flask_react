Truth, Rest Your Head LyricsI've been lazy
I've not waited for you
Nature's hasty
And Lord knows so am I
Six months inside
Wandsworth's finest landmark
My patience has died
First guilt, now hate's best son
For every M.P
All their strong and kind words
"Can't be guilty"
But you and I both know
Truth, rest your head
There is more than a life at stake here
For me, you died tonight
So don't involve me in your plans
When the chat shows beckon
For me, you died tonight
So truth, rest your head
There is more than a life at stake here
For me, you died tonight
So don't involve me in your plans
When the chat shows beckon
For me, you died tonight
So truth, rest your head
There is more than a life at stake here
For me, you died tonight
So don't involve me in your plans
When the money beckons
For me, you died tonight
For me, you died tonight
For me, you died tonight
For me, you died tonightEmbed
