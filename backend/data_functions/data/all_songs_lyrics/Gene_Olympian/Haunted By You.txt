Haunted By You LyricsI, I cross the road and I hide
Just to avoid the times
When you stood at my side
So battered by the tide
A wreck exposed at my door
My eyes they cannot lie
So get up from the floor
For you, you've had your time
Your chance has gone
You're not so strong
Your tongue, they cannot harm me now
I cross the road
And I hide
Just to avoid the times
When you sat at my side
So battered by the tide
Your chance has gone
You're not so strong
Your tongue, they cannot harm me now
With all the things that I've said
I'm still haunted by you
In every town, in every place, you're waiting
But on my tongue, lies disgrace
Still haunted by you
Yes you, you're in my way
With all the things that I've said
I'm still haunted by you
In every town, in every place, you're waiting
From the pub to the grave
I've been haunted by you
Yes you, you're in my way
With all the things that I've said
I'm still haunted by you
In every town, in every place, you're waiting
From my tongue, comes disgrace
Still haunted by you
Yes you, you're in my way
With all the things that I've said
I'm still haunted by you
In every town, in every place, you're waiting
And on my tongue, lies disgrace
Still haunted by you
Yes you, you're in my wayEmbed
