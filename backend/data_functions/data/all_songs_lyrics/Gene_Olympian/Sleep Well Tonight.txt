Sleep Well Tonight LyricsIt's the end of the year
I have just settled here
It may not be much
But it's enough
Yet trouble has sprung
From the pubs and the clubs
We'll see blood soon
When the night's through
Still you can have it all
There's a hole in the wall
Get some money
And we'll show them
This is our territory
This patch belongs to me
Why don't they understand
But I've got a plan
So come take my hand
And sleep well tonight
Tomorrow we fight
Oh would you like it in town?
As the bass drums boom by
So leave this lay-by
I've excuse for a town
Oh, now that everybody knows all about me
Oh, I've been rumbled
I've been sold
Born with plenty
You're left all empty
You can have it all
There's a hole in the wall
Get some dough out
And we'll show out
But still trouble comes
From the pubs and the clubs
Why can't they understand
But I've got a plan
So come take my hand
And sleep well tonight
Tomorrow we fight
Oh would you like it in town?
As the bass drums boom by
We'll leave this lay-by
This excuse for a town
Oh, now that everybody knows all about me
Oh, I've been rumbled
I've been sold
Born with plenty
You're left all empty
Now sleep well tonight
Tomorrow we fight
Oh would you like it in town?
As the bass drums boom by
We'll leave this lay-by
This excuse for a town
Oh, now that everybody knows all about me
Oh, I've been rumbled
I've been sold
Born with plenty
You're left all emptyEmbed
