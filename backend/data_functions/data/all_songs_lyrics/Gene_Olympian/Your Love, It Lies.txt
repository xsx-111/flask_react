Your Love, It Lies LyricsWhile chimneys seep
My room is dark
The wardrobe sees you sleep
There's nothing here
But rumbles from our street
And I'm left wanting more
I've tried to ask, but
While stooping down
Your mouth began to gasp
"oh, look at that
I think I'd better pass"
So I'm left wanting more
Given time and a cheap damp room
And I will show you
All the love and wonder
You could buy
This town lies calm
The low sun climbs
And if you give me time
I'll take your arms
And tend you like a vine
Still left wanting more
Your love, it lies
Those hands deny the hatred in your eyes
So turn that down
And give me a reply
But I'm left wanting more
Given time and a cheap damp room
And I will show you
All the love and wonder
You could buy
And all great loves of this world
Are cast asunder, because
Here comes my thunder
Just for tonight
So get it 
Given time and a cheap damp room
And I will show you
All the wonder
You could buy
And all great loves of this world
Are cast asunder, because
Here comes my thunder
Just for tonight
No need to buyEmbed
