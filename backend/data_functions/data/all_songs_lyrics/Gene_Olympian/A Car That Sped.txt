A Car That Sped LyricsYou have to do it on your own
I can't aid you any more
And you must learn to breathe alone
And all this is yours
Your shoulder's strong
So come lengthen your stride
When you're alone
Oh, there is light outside
But I, I don't recall the time we spent
It's hidden in a car that sped
To its death and to its rest
You have to do it on your own
For I can't help you any more
And you must learn to live alone
And all this is yours
And when you dream
I'll be guiding your thoughts
So, go find the world
And take what's yours
But I, I don't recall the time we spent
It's hidden in a car that sped
To its death and to its rest
But I, I don't recall the time we spent
It's hidden in a car that sped
To its death and to its rest
So, give up the thoughts that bring you dread
And hide them in the car that sped
Me to my death and to my restEmbed
