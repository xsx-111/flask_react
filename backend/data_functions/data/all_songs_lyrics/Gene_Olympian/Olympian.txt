Olympian LyricsGive me something
I can hold
With that something
I will grow
Make me crazy
With your arms
It's all gone hazy
It's all gone wrong
How can you decline
Such grand designs?
And I'm flattered that you thought
I make a good reward
Olympian
Framed by God
So bring me water
To cool off
How can you decline
Such grand designs?
And I'm flattered that you thought
I make a good reward
How can you survive
My blatant lies?
And I'm flattered that you thought
So come taste my good reward
Formidable
But not afraid
Of the next world
Just delayed
I, I wanted to be there with you
For I, can only be normal with you
I, I've given my all for you
Now you, I, I wanted to be there with you
For I, can only be normal with you
I, I've given my all for you
No, no
You, I, I wanted to be there with you
For I, can only be normal with you
I, I've given my all for you
Now you, I, I wanted to be there with you
And I can only be normal with you
And I, I've given my all for you
No, no, no no no
You, I, I wanted to be there with you
And I can only be normal with you
And I, I've given my all for you
No
Now you, I, I wanted to be there with you
And I can only be normal with you
And I, I've given my all for you
No, no, no no
You, I, I wanted to be there with you
And I can only be normal with you
And I, I've given my all for you
No, no
You, I, I wanted to be there with you
For I can only be normal with you
I, I've taken my life for you
Olympian
Framed by God
Never 
You'l be goneEmbed
