Left-Handed LyricsI said
I have one single success to my name
So take cover
I am coming out today
There is no turn of phrase
No easy way to say
Oh, I'll find my feet
And I'll choose my own name
It's hard to be left-handed
But smile, you're not the only one
I know you've been left stranded
Bruised, kicked, lost your mother's love
But take it from me
And take it from me
But take it from me
Evil
I've seen your face
And I know just how you feel
Your Victorian descendant It's illegal
That my clan just aren't seen as people
On the Isle Of Man
I'll serve my time
It's hard to be left-handed
But smile, you're not the only one
I know you've been left stranded
Bruised, kicked, lost your mother's love
But take it from me
And take it from me
Oh take it from me
I will be there tomorrow
I will be there tomorrow
I will be there tomorrow
I will be there tomorrow
I will be there tomorrow
I will be there tomorrow
I will be there tomorrow
I will be thereEmbed
