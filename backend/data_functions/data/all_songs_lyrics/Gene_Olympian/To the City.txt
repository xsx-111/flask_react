To the City LyricsOnwards to the city
Where new money awaits
Far further from the clatter
Of your past life's mistakes
Oh, I've seen it all before
You found the right cliff top
For saying goodbye
As life swung its elbows
And spat in your eye
Oh, I've seen it all before and more
I know what can happen
When you're honest and true
But it's too late to change now
Your years flew too soon
Oh, I've seen it all before and more
So onwards to the city
Where new money awaits
Far further from the clatter
Of your past life's mistakes
Oh, I've seen it all before
I've done it all and moreEmbed
