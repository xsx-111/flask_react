Lady and Man LyricsMomma ain't cheap but I could've been had
I went to college
I could've been a doctor, could've been a lawyer
Oh, come on, not that again!
Cheap but I could've been had
I went to college
I could've been a doctor, could've been a lawyer
Oh, come on, not that again!
You're too angry, you're too vain
You're too reckless, you're too proper
You're too angry, you're too vain
You're too reckless, you're too proper
You're too angry, you're too vain
You're too reckless, you're too proper
You're too angry, you're too vain
You're too reckless, you're too properEmbed
