Bad Things Lyrics
I've been dreaming that my teeth are falling out
I'm driving, there's no steering wheel, no doors, I can't see out
Kicking and screaming on the motorway
The radio static screams my name
Water is coming up faster and faster
Can't move my arms, they've been casted in plaster
Bleeding on the motorway
The radio static repeats my name

Paranoid, I'm paranoid, I'm paranoid
Where did this gun come from?

Don't wait up for me my friend
I'm planning to watch the world burn
Don't wait up for me my friend
I've been planning to watch the world burn down
All your friends are dead and gone

I've been dreaming that our teeth are torn out
Driving, there's no steering wheel, no doors, we can't get out
Metal and plastic on the motorway
The radio static forgot our name
Paranoid, I'm paranoid, I'm paranoid
Where did this gun come from?

Don't wait up for me my friend
I'm planning to watch the world burn
Don't wait up for me my friend
I'm planning to watch the world burn down
All your friends are dead and gone

I'm gonna do it
I'm gonna do it this time, pull it this time
I'm gonna do it
I'm gonna do it this time, pull it this time
Do it this time, pull it this time
Do it this timeEmbed
