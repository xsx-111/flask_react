Hearts Unknown Lyrics
Budding young philosophers
Sit down at the dinner table
They all stand up to pay the bill
But none of them are able
The kids, they're staring at their phones
They're calling it "communication"
They've been to the desert, they're part of the show
But they don't know, what they don't know
Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh

Brilliant young philosophers
Are making your decisions
A brother and sister come to blows
Over a broken television
Now I'm staring at my phone
I'm not calling it communication
I've been to the desert, I'm part of the show
The things I know, the things I know

Hearts unknown beat alone
Who's god will save your soul?
Hearts unknown beat alone
Who's god will save your soul?
Soul, soul, long gone
Soul, soul, long gone

Hearts unknown beat alone
Who's god will save your soul?
Hearts unknown beat alone
They don't know rock and rollEmbed
