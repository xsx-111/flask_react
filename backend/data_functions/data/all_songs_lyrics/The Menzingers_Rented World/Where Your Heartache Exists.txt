Where Your Heartache Exists Lyrics
My girl she's a good one
She's always on my mind
She is a rose and I am a stone
She's always poking her head out
And striking a pose
I'm always plucking her petals
And some nights we fall out of love
Some nights I sleep in her arms
Some nights I sleep
Some nights I sleep on the couch

Well I spent that night in our past life
Wringing out the years from our shoes
In the distance you lived with my signature
Penned on a treaty that kept our armies at rest
But I was a pushy little one
When you tried to find someone new
I just kind of waited around for you
Because what else was I suppose to
What else was I supposed to do?

I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists
I saw it in your face the day we parked your car
On the shoulder by the reservoir
And in my mouth, my words did hide
For fear of being recognized

I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists2Embed
