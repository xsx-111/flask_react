When You Died LyricsI was on my way to heaven when you died
I was racing up the express lane, I was cheating HOV lanes
Made it to the gate with record timing
I quickly threw my hazards on, no bother finding parking
I was on my way to heaven when you died
I was dressed in all black and I hoped
That nobody would notice me or the boltcutters I was hiding
Underneath my oversized jacket
I snuck around the back and broke you out when the gods weren't looking
I was on my way to heaven when you died
But then it was all over
They got us surrounded
They beat us with batons
Cuffed us and threw us in the car
When I wake up I want to talk to a lawyer
I demand a fair and speedy trial
Where do people go when they die?
How do you keep them alive?
How do you make sure that something like this won't ever happen again?
Where do people go when they die?
How do you keep them alive?
How do you make sure that something like this won't ever happen again?
Not to any other friends
But oh, how can a perfect human run out of luck
When there's just so many other people screaming "jackpot!"
And oh, I cannot help but fear the things that I can't control
The things I'll never ever know
Where do people go when they die?
How do you keep them alive?
How do you make sure that something like this won't ever happen again?
Where do people go when they die?
How do you keep them alive?
How do you make sure that something like this won't ever happen again?
Not to any other, any other friendsEmbed
