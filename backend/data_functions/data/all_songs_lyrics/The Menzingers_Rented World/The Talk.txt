The Talk LyricsAlright, I'm okay
We did it your way
I never loved you anyway
You've got your problems
That's your problem
I never loved you anyway
Alright, I'm okay
We did it your way
I never loved you anyway
You've got your problems
That's your problem
I never loved you anyway
Your lips are poison
Your heart is frozen
You never loved me anyway
I want my life back
You turned my chest black
I don't owe you anything
Got me strung out
I'm sweating bullets
I can't sleep
I'm crawling out of my skin
But I'll be okay
I did it my way
And I don't owe you anything
You've got no heart of gold (x2)
You're aesthetic
You're pathetic
I'll never owe you anything
Hey pariah; you're the liar
And I don't owe you anything
I'm not like you
You've got no heart of gold
I'm not like you
You've got no heart of gold
We'll chalk it up to progressEmbed
