Sentimental Physics LyricsI heard a ghost whisper to a teacher
He said, "We're going off to war"
I heard a ghost whisper to a preacher
He said, "We're going to start a war"
A newsman put a paper in my hand, telling me his truth
That Jesus and The Scientist will never reconcile this, no
We're pieces on, we're pieces on the board
We're pieces on, we're pieces on
When you're lonely, you can find me
When you're feeling lost in a bidding war
When you're lonely, you can come find me
When you're feeling lost in a bidding war
We're pieces on, we're pieces on the board
We're pieces on, we're pieces on
When you're lonely, you can find me
When you're feeling lost in a bidding war
When you're lonely, you can come find me
When you're feeling lost in a bidding war
Guns and lawyers, gods and airplanes
Promises, white cloaks, white jackets
I heard a ghost whisper to a teacher
He said, "We're gonna start a war"Embed
