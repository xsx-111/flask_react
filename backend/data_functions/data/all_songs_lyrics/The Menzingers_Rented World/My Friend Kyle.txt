My Friend Kyle Lyrics
We were young kids, we made a difference
We survived those churches and hospitals
Tall tales get taller, but they'll never grow old
Yours is a flame, it never goes out
A guiding light in the storm for our sinking hearts
Yours is the summer that will never end

Sleep now, it's only getting better, man
Sleep now, it's only getting better

Someday, we'll all die, some people never live
You lived the lives of a thousand men
Living from your feet, never from your knees
You are the earth, you are the sun
You are the light above, you are the air in our lungs
You are the earth beneath our feet

Sleep now, it's only getting better, man
Sleep now, it's only getting better
Sleep now, it's only getting better, man
Sleep now, it's only getting better
No, don't fade away, don't fade away
No, don't fade away, don't fade away
No, don't fade away, don't fade away
No, don't fade away, don't fade away
No, don't take him away, don't take him away
No, don't take him away, don't take him away

Sleep now, it's only getting better, man
Sleep now, it's only getting better
(No don't take him away, don't take him away)Embed
