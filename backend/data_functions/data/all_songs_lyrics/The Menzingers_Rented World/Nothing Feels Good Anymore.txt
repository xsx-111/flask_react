Nothing Feels Good Anymore Lyrics
I am a tiny fly, buzzing around in a field
Somewhere in the overgrowth of your memory
And at night you wander through
As the image of a former you
Searching every nook and every cranny
For the form that I'm taking

But baby, baby I'm right here!
I try to shout and scream and say
But my darling you just swat
You just swat me away
And in my greatest desperation
I dig deep into your skin
A little itch to keep the thought of me

But nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good

I'm at the party in a cloud of nicotine
Exhaled by drunk twentysomethings
There's a couple arguing in the bathroom
A couple kids just trying to get high
I try to make my way outside
'Cause I've got to see you tonight
I start pacing then running
"But baby, baby buzz me in!"
I ring your intercom and say
But you just poke your head through the curtain
And my heart's on the floor

But nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good

Like the dead cat in the alley
Like the garbage overturned
Like the uninviting orgy
On top of some dog shit in the yard
I had a life, I thought I had it together
I thought my house could never burn
But that was before, but that was before

Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels goodEmbed
