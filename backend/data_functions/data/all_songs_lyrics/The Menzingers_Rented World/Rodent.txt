Rodent Lyrics
I wanna be more discreet, I want 'em all to quit following me
In the walls held captive, lives a mouse
I don't have the guts to kick him out
In the bars where I live, lives someone
Who I would've hated when I was young
When I swore life had a purpose
When I was sure the whole things worth it
Damn the days we took for granted
Never again will I let anyone close to me

Me and the rodent in the wall have more in common after all

So burn the fucker down, I don't care anymore
I'll let it all go
Cause if this is what you want, I understand
Good luck with the guilt left on your hands
I've tried running, I've tried hiding
I've tried everything but dying
Damn the days we took for granted
Never again will I let anyone close to me
Yeah, me and the rodent in the wall have more in common after all
Me and the rodent in the wall, we have more in common after all

I am only bad news
I am only bad news, news for youEmbed
