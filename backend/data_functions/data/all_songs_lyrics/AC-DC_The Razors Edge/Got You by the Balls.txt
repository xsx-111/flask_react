Got You by the Balls Lyrics
Hey, mister businessman
Head of the company
Are you looking for a lady?
One who likes to please?
Hey, mister businessman
This one likes to tease
With a special service
And the French quantities

But she won't sacrifice
What you want, tonight
She won't come across
Unless there's money in her hand
And she's calling all the shots

She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls

Hey, mister businessman
High society
She can play the school girl
And spank you all you please
But she won't sacrifice
What you want, tonight
She won't come across
Unless there's money in her hand
She don't go overtime

Kiss your balls goodbye!


(Hangin' left, hangin' right)
Got you by the balls
(Got your shorts, got your curlies)
Got you - by the balls
