The Razors Edge Lyrics
There's fighting on the left
And marching on the right
Don't look up in the sky
You're gonna die of fright

Here comes the razor's edge

You're living on the edge
Don't know wrong from right
They're breathing down your neck
You're running out of lives

And here comes the razor's edge
Here comes the razor's edge

The razor's edge

(Razor's edge)
To raise the dead
(Razor's edge)
To cut to shreds
To raise the dead


Here comes the razor's edge
Here comes the razor's edge

Well, here it comes
To cut to shreds
The razor's edge

It's the razor's edge
On the razor's edge
That you'll be cut to shreds
Got a razor's edge
By the razor's edge6Embed
