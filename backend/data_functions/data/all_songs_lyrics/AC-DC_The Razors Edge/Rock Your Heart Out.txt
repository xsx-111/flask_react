Rock Your Heart Out Lyrics
Got the devil in you
Got the devil in me
Play a dangerous tune
Come on and dance with thee
You gotta
Ball your fists up
Shout your mouth off
Beat the walls down
Get the freak out

Rock a little, rock a little
Rock your little heart out

You got to rock it on out
Get down

Got everything you want
Got everything you need
Don't worry 'bout the cost
Just sell your soul to me
Ya gotta
Bring the house down
Beat the drums loud
Bleed your life dry
Climb on, lets fly
Rock a little, rock a little
Rock your little heart out

Rock, rock your little heart out
Rock it on down
Yeah
Cut your teeth on this


Ya gotta
Put your foot down
Beat your chest hard
Blow your brains out
Feel her shout loud
Ya gotta

Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock, rock your little heart out
Rock, rock your little heart out
You rock it on down
Ooh yeah
Rock her little, rock her little heart out
Yeah-yeah
You gotta

Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock, rock, rock your heart out
Rock, rock, rock your heart right out
Rock, rock, rock your little heart out
Rock, rock, rock your heart out

You gotta rock a little, rock a little
Rock your little heart out
You got to rock your little heart right - right out1Embed
