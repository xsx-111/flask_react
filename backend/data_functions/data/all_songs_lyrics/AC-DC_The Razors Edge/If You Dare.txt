If You Dare Lyrics
Honey, do you love me?
Love me like you do
Honey, won't you come outside and play?

If you dare
If you dare, yeah

Honey, do you love me?
Love me like you do
Woman, won't you come outside and play?

If you dare
If you dare

Woman, if you love me
Love me like you do
Love me like you say
Woman, won't you come outside and play?

If you dare
(Come on outside, come on outside
Come on outside and play)
If you dare

If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)
If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)
If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)
If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)
If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)
If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)
If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)1Embed
