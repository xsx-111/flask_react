Shot Of Love LyricsGunnin' on down
Come on, come on, yeah

Come on honey, take a trip with me
We'll take a double shot of ecstasy
I'll drink some water from a wooden cup
And keep a rocking until the sun comes up

And I warn you
It's the best shot of your life
And I warn you
It's the best shot of your life

Shot of love
Shot of love

Rock you, little lady, make you blow and breathe (yeah)
A little bit of what you need is guaranteed
Come on now, honey, we'll get full of desire
A-humpin' and a-pumpin' till we start a fire

And I warn you
It's the best shot of your life
And I warn you
It's the best shot of your life
Shot of love
Shot of love

Shot of love
I'm gonna make you bleed


And I warn you
It's the best shot of your life
And I warn you
It's the best shot of your life

Shot of love
Shot of love
Make you bleed
Shot of love, shot of love, shot of love
A humping and pumping
I got you jumping
Shot of love, shot of love, shot of love
A little bit of what you need is guaranteed
Shot of love, shot of love, shot of love
Honey, let me warn you, I'm coming for you
Shot of love, shot of love, shot of love
Shot of love, shot of love
Come on, give me shot of love1Embed
