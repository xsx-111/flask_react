You Just Have to Be Crazy LyricsYou just have to be crazy don't you
You just have to be out of your mind
You just have to be crazy don't you
You just have to be
True or not
True or not
You just have to be touched don't you
You just have to be tapped on the head
You just have to be crazy don't you
You just have to be
True or not
True or not
True or not
You just have
You just have to be starry baby
You just have to be chocolate cake
You just have to be starry baby
You just have to be chocolate cake
True or not
True or not
True or not
You just have
Na na na
True or not
True or notEmbed
