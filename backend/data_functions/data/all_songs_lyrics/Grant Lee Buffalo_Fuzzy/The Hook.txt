The Hook LyricsThere's one thing I tell you friend
I don't believe in supermen
Who fly thru the clouds above the rest
I don't believe in the best
And I never wanted to fight with you
It's just the last thing that I wanna do
But you're so afraid to look at love
Gotta let it all go this cut-above stuff
'Cause this is the hook that drags you
This is the hook in the crook of your neck
It's the hook that snags you
This is the hook
And there's one thing I tell you friend
All of our trials gonna come to an end
And you and I we're gonna fall
Like we never have stood on this little earth at all
'Cause this is the hook that drags you
This is the hook in the crook of your neck
It's the hook that snags you
This is the hook in the crook of your neck
It's hook that drags you
This is the hook
Oh oh ohEmbed
