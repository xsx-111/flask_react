Fuzzy Lyrics
Bring me home
To this house of, many days
Just lay me on the floor
Hard and cool as slate

You know I love it more and more
Than before I ran away
It triggers off so many hurts
Hurtful words and broken plates

I've been lied to
Now I'm Fuzzy
I've been lied to

All and all
The world is small enough for both of us
To meet upon the interstate
Waiting on a train

And just when those big arms lift up
Fall in love with no time to say it
And I would have liked to
Now I'm Fuzzy
I would have liked to
Now I'm Fuzzy
Fuzzy now

Here we are
In our car
Driving down the street
We're looking for a place to stop
Have a bite to eat
We hunger for a bit of faith
To replace the fear

We water like a dead bouquet
Does no good does it dear?

And I've been lied to
Now I'm Fuzzy
We've been lied to
Now we're Fuzzy
Fuzzy now
