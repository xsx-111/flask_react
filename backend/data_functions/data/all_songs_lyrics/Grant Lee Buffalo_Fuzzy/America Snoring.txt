America Snoring LyricsI hear you America snoring
I hear you America snoring
Did ya see it on TV
Or in your own backyard
Gates' LAPD
And they called The National Guard
Then the tanks came rolling down
Sunset Boulevard
And I hear America snoring
They want ta' legislate the moon
They want ta' legislate the womb
They wanna legislate all the things they hate
They want ta' legislate this tune
And I hear America snoring snoring
I hear you America snoring snoring
Give wind time to blow
The rooster to crow
Plug my ears but I hear
America
Oh oh oh
See the shoemaker and his shoes
Sliver needle thread and glue
He's closing up the shop
Move it all to Timbuktu
Where the labor force is cheap
And the rivers there run deep
But I hear America snoring
I hear you America snoring snoring America
I hear you America snoring snoring America
I hearEmbed
