Jupiter and Teardrop Lyrics
Just a girl who can't say no
And her sweetheart on parole
Parents named her Jupiter
To bless her with a lucky soul

He's a boy who never cried
When they locked him up inside
And she nicknamed him her teardrop
For the tattoo by his eye

Now she's sleeping in her bed
And he's sleeping in her bed

And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop

She divines by radio
Pushing buttons show to show
And she wonders 'bout the fate of
Lovers in the barrio
She forgets after a while
When she tunes in on the dial
Jackie Wilson's Lonely Teardrops
And she drives another mile

Now she's sleeping in her bed
And he's sleeping in her bed

And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop

And they want to have a child
Walk together down the aisle
But the world they live in is mean
And it's built on sheer denial

The phone rings it's for her
Gotta see ya Jupiter
I'm in trouble with the law
Bring my 38 caliber
Now she's sleeping in her bed
As she pulls the phone plug dead, dead

And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop

And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
Oh, and it's Jupiter and Teardrop

And it's Jupiter and Tear
Ugh
And it's Jupiter and Tear
Oh oh
Ju-huhEmbed
