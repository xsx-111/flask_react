One Mil Lyrics
Camera girl, you still there?
If I look, you'll disappear
Worse, you might wanna talk
I'm so underprepared
I don't know, is it real?
I can't ignore the way it feels
Like the stomach punch it is

I try but I can waste one million chances
Before you're gone, before I get your name
Keep dreamin' 'cause I'm the only one awake here
You're always gone, always slip away

Can't explain why it sticks
Why I seem to get stuck in
Unsustainable amounts of time reliving this
I wish I had mastery of wit, luck, fearless confidence
And shred majestically to your heart

I try but I can waste one million chances
Before you're gone, before I get your name
Keep dreamin' 'cause I'm the only one awake here
You're always gone, always slip away

I try but I can waste one million chances
Before you're gone, before I get your name
Keep dreamin' 'cause I'm the only one awake here
You're always gone, always slip away
I try but I can waste one million chances
Before you're gone, before I get your name
Keep dreamin' 'cause I'm the only one awake here
You're always gone, always slip awayEmbed
