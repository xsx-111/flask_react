Love Never  Lyrics
Love ain't never been your friend
Love never gonna hear what you're demanding
Love ain't some magical thing
Love never gonna be the way you're dreaming

It's gonna seem so far
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Do you want the work more than the reward?

Love ain't some magical thing
Love never gonna be the way you're dreaming

It's gonna seem so far
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Until you stop asking "Oh, what is it all for?"
Do you want the work more than the reward?


It's gonna seem so far
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Until you stop asking "Oh, what is it all for?"
Do you want the work more than the reward?Embed
