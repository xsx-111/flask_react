Recommit Lyrics
Will they tell you what you missed?
All you have traded in
And it hits
You're not that different
The truth is no one did
Half of it

Think all this time what you're giving
Stay in my heart or waste another life
Start another life

From a fever to a kiss
Such frivolousness
They exist
It's all significant
No one straight line to live
Recommit

Think all this time what you're giving
Stay in my heart or waste another life
Start another life
Think all this time what you're giving
Stay in my heart or waste another life
Start another life
Always commanding
A way out
Is coming

Think all this time what you're giving
Stay in my heart or waste another life
Start another life
Think all this time what you're giving
Stay in my heart or waste another life
Start another life

Or waste another life
Start another life1Embed
