555 Lyrics
I keep my focus on the simple things
Trying to find some peace along the way
Wish I knew how long I'm supposed to wait
Holding on but just barely

Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
There's always a reason to let it change
Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?
There's always a reason for the pain

I'm doing the things that I'm told every day, every day, every day
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?

Never had anything to prove
But never was anyone like you
All you fought through, all you had to face
Made you stronger, unafraid

Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
There's always a reason to let it change
Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?
Always a reason for the pain
I'm doing the things that I'm told every day, every day, every day
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?
I gotta believe that you're there when I sing, when I sing, when I sing
'Cause if you're not real, I'm losing my head, in my head, in my head

Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
There's always a reason to let it change
Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?
Always a reason for the pain

I'm doing the things I've been told every day, every day, every day
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?
I gotta believe that you're there when I sing, when I sing, when I sing
'Cause if you're not real, I'm losing my head, in my head, in my head

I keep my focus on the simple things
Trying to find some peace along the way1Embed
