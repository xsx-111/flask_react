Congratulations Lyrics
There's no clarity in front of me
Only degrees of hating
Obscenity, there's no charity
Some don't deserve to make it
You'll blame and fight each other
For just a slice of plunder
Too down and tired to wonder
Whose foot you're crawling under

Oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh (Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh)
You're on your own
You're on your own

Read carefully, can't possibly
A threat to future earnings
Suspiciously, through editing
The facts are disappearing
With discipline and message
You'll take awkward possession
Of nothing you really wanted
Welcome, congratulations
Oh-oh, you're on
You're on your own

There's no clarity in front me
Only degrees of hating
Obscenity, there's no charity
Some don't deserve to make it
You'll blame and fight each other
For just a slice of plunder
Too down and tired to wonder
Whose foot you're crawling under

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh1Embed
