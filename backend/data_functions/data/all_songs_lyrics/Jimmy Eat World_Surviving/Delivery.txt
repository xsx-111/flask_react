Delivery Lyrics
Well, I know I'm dreaming
But it feels too good to stop
The picture in my head is always moving
We're alone at sunset
There's snowfall in air
It's only special once 'cause there's an ending

And we realize we're in a future memory

I can only use what I learn from you
And the rest I quietly accept and burn through
I can only be so much potentially
From the rest, I patiently request delivery

Don't worry where we end up
This ending up's not real
The life we build we never stop creating
So we move to a cliffside
A shoreline nowhere
A freezing drive ahead with every crossing

And the things you hope someday will come keep waiting
I can only use what I learn from you
And the rest I quietly accept and burn through
I can only be so much potentially
From the rest, I patiently request delivery

Sold on a lie
A lie old as time
You'll search until you die
Only partially the truth
Someone's out there for you
But not everyone's ready to be found
No, you might not be ready to be found

I can only use what I learned from you
And the rest I quietly accept and burn through
I can only be so much potentially
From the rest, I patiently request delivery
I can only use what I learn from you
And the rest I quietly accept and burn through
I can only be so much potentially
From the rest, I patiently request deliveryEmbed
