Diamond Lyrics
When I find myself awake
I'll put my thoughts down on the page
Half-asleep, I'll make a list
Then read back all my greatest hits
Should meditate, should work out more
Should read until my brain gets sore
Meet someone, go far away
Try being socially less strange

That's how a diamond grows, yeah
Give yourself the right chance over time
Don't believe them if they try to sell you something quicker, yeah

I cut at least half of my friends
But no one noticed or mentioned
I thought at last I'd breathe easy
But then I thought a lot of things
Hey, new year, hey, new you
You left so much low-hanging fruit
You're in the ring for the title fight
With only montage training time

That's how a diamond grows, yeah
Give yourself the right chance over time
Don't believe them if they try to sell you something quicker, yeah
That's how a diamond grows, yeah
Reach as far as you can, then hold tight
Don't believe them if they try to tell you something different, yeah
They say a diamond grows with time
I believe it 'cause I've seen it with my eyes
Well, there's a guaranteed parade of broken promises
Did you expect some kind of miracle?
You do what you can do, that's all, all, all

That's how a diamond grows, yeah
Give yourself the right chance over time
Don't believe them if they try to sell you something quicker, yeah
That's how a diamond grows with time
Don't believe them if they try to tell you something different2Embed
