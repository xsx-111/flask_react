All the Way (Stay) Lyrics
Going out, we hope to lose ourselves
Then get found in unlikely places
A little presumption's all you need
To end up empty
Who really says they hope they'll meet the one
For the first time at a bar drinking early?
Easy enough to say "Hey man, I'm done"
And never hear them say

Oh, honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
And no one really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-oh, oh-oh

We get discouraged by the pointlessness
And we're pretty quick to judge things pointless
There's what I want and what I need
And the latter takes a while to see
It doesn't matter how often, how old
It starts with an awkward beginning
I believe that what I've learned has worth
And what I choose to do means something
So honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
'Cause no one really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show, oh-ho, oh-ho

Crowds and the noise receding
Down to just you and me, yeah
We could do anything you want

So honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
Whoever really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show? Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh1Embed
