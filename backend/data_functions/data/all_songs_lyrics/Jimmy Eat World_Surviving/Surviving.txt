Surviving Lyrics
Don't hide your face
What you were before
Doesn't have to be
You anymore
Maybe you've been scared
And that's what you know
And all the shame
Gonna call you home
It's gonna call you home

It never was your fault
But still a part to play
You carry it so close
You can read its name
In a lot of ways
You're still that lost kid
Yeah, you can still survive
But not exactly live
No, not exactly live

Gonna stand this ground
Gonna say it loud
Never define yourself
By choices others make
If no one said it yet
It would be a shame
That ends right now
You're not alone in pain
Never alone in pain
Never alone in pain
Never alone in pain
Never alone in painEmbed
