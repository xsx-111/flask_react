Criminal Energy Lyrics
The ghost of recent misery
Still has a song to sing
You captivated hearts
Waiting for a spark
No one you care to recognize
Suddenly in control
Unfortunate to find
What it is inside

Criminal energy
If you got blood to bleed
Your fever with the fight
Your each and every night
Oh, yeah, you'll come to see
We're the same, we're the same, yeah, it's understood
We're gonna take, gonna take while the getting's good
Come get it all for free
Criminal energy, criminal energy
Huh

Answer any conspiracy
So irresistible
But there's no them to see
Only you and me
No face, no cause for empathy
They tell you all the time
The threat is still alive
Yeah, that's still a lie
Criminal energy
If you got blood to bleed
Your fever with the fight
Your each and every night
Oh, yeah, you'll come to see
That we're the same, we're the same, yeah, it's understood
We're gonna take, gonna take while the getting's good
Come get it all for free
Criminal energy
Criminal energy
Oh!


Criminal energy
If you got blood to bleed
Your fever with the fight
Your each and every night
Oh, yeah, you'll come to see
That we're the same, we're the same, yeah, it's understood
We're gonna take, gonna take while the getting's good
Come get it all for free
Criminal energy
Criminal energy
Criminal energy
Criminal energy
