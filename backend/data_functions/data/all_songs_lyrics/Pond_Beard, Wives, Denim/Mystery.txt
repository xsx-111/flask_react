Mystery Lyrics
I'm never really sure where to go or what to do
All I really know is that I've got you
Every time I wake, I focus on the world I see
When I see it's you, I hope it's not a dream

Every morning now
I wake up smiling
But I still haven't figured out
It's still a mystery

I washed up on the shore shaking and confused
I tempered all my thoughts of a less view of you
The stars are out tonight, everything is at it seems
And when I see it's you, I hope it's not a dream

Every morning now I wake up smiling
But I still haven't figured out
It's still a mystery
