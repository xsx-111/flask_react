Fantastic Explosion of Time LyricsFantastic explosion of time, you slither over the light and you fade away
Into a splendid design when we have any moment we move every way
I don't wanna explode in time
I don't wanna explode in time
Fantastic explosion of time, you slither over the light and you fade away
Into a splendid design when we have any moment we move every way
Heading colossus of ice, we're riding the highways, we're going to watch
Bumping the ether is hard when you got so different little types of touch
I don't wanna explode in time
I don't wanna explode in time
Fantastic explosion of time, you slither over the light and you fade away
Into a splendid design when we have any moment we move every way
Heading colossus of ice, we're riding the highways, we're going to watch
Bumping the ether is hard when you got so different little types of touch
Fantastic explosion of time, you slither over the light and you fade away
Into a splendid design when we have any moment we move every way
Oh yeah, hey, heyEmbed
