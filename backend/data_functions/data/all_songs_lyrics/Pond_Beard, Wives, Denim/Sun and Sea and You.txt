Sun and Sea and You LyricsI... keep... alive
And he's still... forty five years old and cold
And all my wounds are...
When the... floats and flies
Steadily before your eyes
It's best to discuss
You feel...
Hey the sun and sea and you
And... OK at what you do
And what you do is beautiful
I can bear to trip today
Throw away my head
I might just...
Hey the sun and sea and you
And I don't care what you do
What you do is beautifulEmbed
