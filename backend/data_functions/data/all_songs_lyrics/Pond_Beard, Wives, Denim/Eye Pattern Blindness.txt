Eye Pattern Blindness LyricsEvery day I wake, physically weaker than before
In my growing mind, the dreams I've left behind, the sign that there was more
Colourless and vague, the thoughts they slip away with the daylight
Can I get it back, what can I do to get them back inside?
Into the delay, the sounds don't carry on into the graves
All I've left to find, the parts I realise, all collective thoughts
Blackness it awaits, slumber hits the rain outside my window
With the brand new day, I've got some things I really have to findEmbed
