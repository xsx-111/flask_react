Dig Brother Lyrics(?)
Wooh!!
It don’t matter what clothes you wear
It doesn’t matter how you do your hair
All that matters is you are looking strong

And I dig, brother, I dig
Dig, brother, I dig
Ahhhh...
She is a strong look

It don’t matter whether you are right or wrong
It doesn’t matter any way
You did  tomorrow what you've did today

And it's cool brother it's cool
Cool brother it's cool
Ohhhh (I'm talking demons(?))
It's cool brother it's cool
Cool brother it's cool
Ohhhh...

Listen shadow, the place is a mess (?)
When you're living close to the edge (yeeahhh)
Just remember that you have a brother
And I know brother I know
I know brother I know

Huh
Dig society, I gotta look
Dig society, we gotta look and dig it
And dig it! (huhhh)
Dig society, I gotta move
You like being alone, been proved true (?)
Take it off!
Oh!, Jesus, take off that shit
Seriously
(Kevin's laugh can be heard at the end of the song, along with someone saying something like "Ah it's pretty shit (?) that one")Embed
