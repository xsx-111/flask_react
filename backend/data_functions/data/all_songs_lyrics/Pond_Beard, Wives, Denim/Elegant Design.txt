Elegant Design LyricsEvery day's the same
Devoid of anything
Walking around the broken fences
And see never empty land
But I don't really mind
It's just so hard to find
??? and the rain's gone
For a little piece of mind
All I'm trying to define is the elegant design
It's gonna take so many words, I'm trippin' fast for time
Mountains crash into the sea, but it doesn't seem to worry me
I only think of you
Take the busy way
That's what my friends all say
But I don't think they really get the point
Of elegant sweet day
I'm sure it's gonna end
I may not have any friends
But at the end of the day, I think I'll be okay
If I work it out instead
All I'm trying to define is the elegant design
It's gonna take so many words, I'm trippin' past for time
Mountains crash into the sea, but it doesn't seem to worry me
I only think of you
I only think of you2Embed
