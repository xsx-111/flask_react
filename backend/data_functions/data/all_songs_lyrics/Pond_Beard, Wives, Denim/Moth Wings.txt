Moth Wings Lyrics
Stepped on some moth wings
I  think I nearly broke a wing
I never thought seagulls love
But you should never give it up (give it up)

Brought a kite to the site
We aim to start the real deal (we aim to start the real deal)
(?) to back what I thought to steal

Hitch a ride to the other side
To see what I can find (to see what I can find)
Cold place, blue suedes
To tell you should never give it up, give it up

Brought a kite to the site
We aim to start the real deal (we aim to start the real deal)
(?) to back what I thought to steal
Ahh
Ahhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhhh!
Stepped on some moth wings
I  think I nearly broke a wing (I nearly broke a wing)
I never thought seagulls love
But you should never give it up (give it up)

Brought a kite to the site
We aim to start the real deal (we aim to start the real deal)
Oh, right
Wooohh!
Ahh
Ahhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhhh!
I thought I told you to take it off
(Kevin Parker says something like "A flaccid (?) getting in my... my lens" at the end of the song)3Embed
