You Broke My Cool LyricsHey
Come look out in the hall, man
There's a bat hanging off the wall, man
Wanna help it out
I wanna help it out
You
Don't wanna be stupid, ugly, dumb
Wanna be a little more likely, son
Spend my golden (?)
You were gone today, must've dropped my heart
All my hair was falling out
I never thought I was through
Now I live with a yeti and a caterpillar king
I wanna make love on everything
Make love on you
You, you broke my cool
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You broke it right in two
All I can do is stand the pressure
Now I can't talk, though I'd write you a letter
Maybe a song
Maybe that will be better
Now I'm a mess in a sequin dress
No, I don't care, don't wanna obsess
I'm a mess
Or maybe you just broke my cool
You broke my coolEmbed
