Allergies LyricsEveryday we wake outside the sea
Forgetting all of our allergies
To the world
Space was a lie
But the sun still shines
Down on me
But you don't have to tell me
That the waves will crash
Easily
Everyday we wake outside the sea
Forgetting all of our allergies
And we don't have to sit around for weed
This world
Space was a lie
And the sun still shines
Down on me
But you don't have to tell me
That the waves will crash
