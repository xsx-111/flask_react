When It Explodes LyricsTell me how long I can float
Don’t want to sing the song
That we wrote together so long ago
So long ago
So let me know
So let me know
Where is it going
When it explodes
I hope that my head is not all straight
Loving you and I just can’t wait
Till something great something unknown
So let me know
So let me know
Where is it going
When it explodesEmbed
