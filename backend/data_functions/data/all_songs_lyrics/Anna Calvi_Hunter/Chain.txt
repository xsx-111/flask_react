Chain LyricsShe asked me
Are you lonely
And she took me
To the back seat
And she told me
She told me don't breathe
I’ll be the boy you be the girl I’ll be the girl you be the boy I’ll be the girl (wonderful feeling)
I’ll be the boy you be the girl I’ll be the girl you be the boy I’ll be the boy (wonderful feeling)
Ch-ch chain me, ch-ch chain me
Ch-ch chain me, ch-ch chain me
I’ll be the boy you be the boy until I see a broken mirror in the sun
I’ll be the boy you be the girl I’ll be the girl you be the boy I’ll be the girl (come up to feel it)
And in the golden light the sun began to set on her red lips and her words
Ch-ch chain me, ch-ch chain me
Ch-ch chain me, ch-ch chain me
Ch-ch chain me, ch-ch chain me
Ch-ch chain me, ch-ch chain me
She asked me
Do you feel free
And she told me
She told me don’t breathe
AHH
I’ll be the boy you be the girl I’ll be the girl you be the boy I’ll be the boy (wonderful feeling)
And in the golden light the sun began to set on her red lips and her wordsEmbed
