Wish LyricsI got one more wish before I die
So please don't you stop me, no don't you stop me
I got one more wish before I die
So please don't you stop me, no don't you stop me
Like a mirror staring out to sea
My mind is free
So please don't you stop me, no don't you stop me
I got one more wish before I die
So please don't you stop me, no don't you stop me
No don't you stop me, no don't you stop me
Cherie your eyes
Cherie your eyes
The streets go by
Cherie your eyes
I got one more wish before I die
I got one more wish before I die
Cherie your eyes
Cherie your eyes
The streets go by
Cherie your eyesEmbed
