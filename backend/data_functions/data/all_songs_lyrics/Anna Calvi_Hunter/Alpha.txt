Alpha LyricsThe lights are on the tv is on
My body is still on
The lights are on the tv is on
My body is still on
Electrified statuette against the high rise
I wanna know if I can feel alive
I wanna know cause I'm an alpha
I divide and conquer
I'm alpha
The lights are on the radio is on
My body is still on
The lights are on the radio is on
My body is still on
Electrified
I wanna know if I can satisfy
I wanna know if I can pacify
I wanna know
Cause I'm an alpha
Do you see me try?
I wanna know are you satisfied?
I wanna know do I satisfy?
Statuette against the high rise
Silhouette of my jawline
I wanna know if I can feel alive
I wanna know cause I'm an alpha
Cause I'm an alpha
I divide and conquerEmbed
