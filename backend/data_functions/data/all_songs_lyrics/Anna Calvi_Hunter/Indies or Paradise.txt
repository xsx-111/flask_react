Indies or Paradise LyricsGod?
Crawl down, down on my knees, crawling through the trees like an animal
I taste taste taste of the dirt, taste the dirt of us
God I feel the rain rain rain on my back, crawling through the trees like an animal I go
I want us in the air in Paradise
I want us in the air in paradise
I get lost in the air in Paradise
I want us in the air in paradise
Somebody
I’m looking up if you’re looking down
Somebody
I’m crawling up if you’re crawling down
Somebody
I’m looking up with you’re looking down
I want us in the air in Paradise
I want us in the air in paradise
I get lost in the air I lose my mind
I want us in the air in paradise
Rain rain rain on my back, crawling through the trees like an animal I
I taste taste taste of the dirt, taste the dirt of us
God I feel the sweat sweat sweat of my back crawling through the trees like an animal I fall
Your beauty will protect me
Your beauty will come save me
Your beauty will come save me
I want us in the air in Paradise
I want us in the air in paradise
I get lost in the air in Paradise
I want us in the air in paradise
I wantEmbed
