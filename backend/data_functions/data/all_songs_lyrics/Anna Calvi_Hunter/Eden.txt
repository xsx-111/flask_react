Eden LyricsI tell a lie
I’m a needle in the heart
You’re a shadow in the dark
In a woodchip house
In the garden we hide
With our shoes untied
The storm rising up
Our hair’s tangled up
My words are tangled up
The home we’re thinking of
We’ll fall soon enough
We’ll fall through the ground
I tell a lie
On your bed so small
With your heroes on the wall
In the fading light
Through the window I see
All your poplar trees
The storm rising up
Our hair tangled up
My words are tangled up
The home we’re thinking of
We’ll fall soon enough
We’ll fall through the ground
Eden night
Eden nightEmbed
