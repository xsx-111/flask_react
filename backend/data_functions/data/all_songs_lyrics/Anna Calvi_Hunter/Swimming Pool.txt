Swimming Pool LyricsAh the swimming pool
Shadows of light
Shadows divide on the earth
Come down to the swimming pool
Waves of desire
Waves of desire on the earth
Come down to the swimming pool
I can be the one
If you can be the one
If you can be the one one
Then I can be the one
Shadows of light
Shadows divide on the earth
Come down to the swimming pool
Down we will dive
Down to the night of the earth
Come down to the swimming pool
Ahh
Ahh
Ah the swimming pool
Ah the swimming poolEmbed
