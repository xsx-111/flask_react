Away LyricsThere is no shadow of mine
There is a rage in the sky
Is this the moment sublime
You know I ask no more of it all
You know I ask no more of it all
There is no time for a lie
There is no time to decide
Into the sky entire
You know I ask no more of it all
You know I ask no more of it all
You know I ask no more of it
You know I ask just take it all
Ahh ahh
And I will blow it away
Away away away away away1Embed
