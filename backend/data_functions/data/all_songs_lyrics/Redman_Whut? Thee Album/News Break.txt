News Break Lyrics
In Los Angelesâ€¦
In Los Angeles, law enforcement officers and troops are trying to make it a calm weekend in that troubled city, as you know there has been...
Now the death toll it's up to 35
And there've been perhaps 500 injured out there
We're gonna begin our coverage with Jim Hanchek standing by in Los Angeles
Jim?

-Reggie...
-What the hell you doing here?
-Reggie come help me, man
-No!Embed
