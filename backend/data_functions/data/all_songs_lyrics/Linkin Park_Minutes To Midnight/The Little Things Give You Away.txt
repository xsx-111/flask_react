The Little Things Give You Away Lyrics
Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean, everywhere

Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground
Now I, now I do


The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away

All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away14Embed
