The Rest of the Night Lyrics
Why stop now?
Let's party for the rest of the night
Seven o'clock, eight o'clock, nine o'clock, ten
You wanna go home? Why? Honey, when?
We may never get this chance again
Let's party for the rest of the night

Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
Let's party for the rest of the night
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
Let's party for the rest of the night
(Come on, let's)

Why leave now?
Let's party for the rest of the night
Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, one o'clock, two
Me, tired? Well, boo-hoo
I'm starting to fall in love with you
Let's party for the rest of the night

Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
Let's party for the rest of the night
Yeah, yeah, woah-woah, yeah
Let's party for the rest of the night
Hit me

Why slow down?
Let's party for the rest of the night
Three o'clock, four o'clock, five o'clock, six
Let's throw it all into the mix
And open up our bag of tricks
And party for the rest of the night
Hit it

Woah, woah, yeah, yeah
We'll party for the rest of the night
Woah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We'll party for the rest of the night
Hit it


We never had an issue
We never had a fight
Someone must be doing
Something right
Yeah, yeah, woah-woah, yeah
Let's party for the rest of the night
Yeah, yeah, woah-woah, yeah
Let's party for the rest of the night
Hit me

Party for the rest of the night
Every morning, yeah
Party through the night
Why stop? Why stop?Embed
