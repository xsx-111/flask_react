Please Stay Lyrics
Please stay, please stay
Two words I've never thought I'd learn to say
Don't go away, please stay

Don't leave me here
When so many things so hard to see are clear
I need you near to me

Will you stay with me 'til the end?
When there's nothing left, but you and me and the wind
We'll never know 'til we try
To find the other side of goodbye

Oh, sweet darlin'


Will you stay with me 'til the end?
When there's nothing left but you and me and the wind
We'll never know 'til we try
To find the other side of goodbye
Please stay, please slay
Two words I've never thought I'd learn to say
Don't go away, please stay
Please stay
Please stayEmbed
