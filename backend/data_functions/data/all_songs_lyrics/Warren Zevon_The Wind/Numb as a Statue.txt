Numb as a Statue Lyrics
Let's do another bad one then
'Cause I like it when the blood drains from Dave's face

I'm numb as a statue
I may have beg, borrow or steal
Some feelings from you
So I can have some feelings too

I'm pale as a ghost
You know what I love about you
That's what I need the most

I'm gonna beg, borrow or steal
Some feelings from you
I'm gonna beg, borrow or steal
So I can have some feelings too

And I don't care if it's superficial
You don't have to dig down deep
Just bring enough for the ritual
Get here before I fall asleep
Ain't nothing special
When the present meets the past
I've always taken care of business
I've paid my first and last
Now can I get a witness, hey?

I don't care if it's superficial
You don't have to dig down deep
Just bring enough for the ritual
Get here before I fall asleep

When I'm numb as a statue
I may have beg, borrow or steal
Some feelings from you
So I can have some feelings too
I'm pale as a ghost
But you know what I love about you
Huh, that's what I need the most

I'm gonna beg, borrow or steal
Some feelings from you
I'm gonna beg, borrow or steal
So I can have some feelings too
I'm gonna beg, borrow or steal
Some feelings from you
I'm gonna beg, borrow or steal
So I can have some feelings too
Yeah
Oh, yeahEmbed
