Disorder in the House Lyrics
Hey

Disorder in the house
The tub runneth over
Plaster falling down in pieces by the couch of pain
Disorder in the house
Time to duck and cover
Helicopters hover over rough terrain

Disorder in the house
Reptile wisdom
Zombies on the lawn staggering around
Disorder in the house
There's a flaw in the system
And the fly in the ointment's gonna bring the whole thing down

The floodgates are open
We've let the demons loose
The big guns have spoken
And we've fallen for the ruse

Disorder in the house
It's a fate worse than fame
Even the Lhasa Apso seems to be ashamed
(You might wanna handle that one yourself)
Disorder in the house
The doors are coming off the hinges
The earth will open and swallow up the real estate

I just got my paycheck
I'm gonna paint the whole town gray
Whether it's a night in Paris
Or a Fresno matinee
It's the home of the brave
And the land of the free
Where the less you know
The better off you'll be

Cut it
Woo


Disorder in the house
All bets are off
I'm sprawled across the davenport of despair
Disorder in the house
I'll live with the losses
And watch the sundown through the portiere
Here we go
Alright
Hit me hard
Hey
Huh, end this thing with style
Good gosh, I'm heading out
