Human Race LyricsToday no one cares
Tomorrow no one shares
Because they all will be gone, but the children
The children of the fires and floods
Children of the fires and floods
Who's gonna save
The human race?
Where are the children gonna run and hide?
The children of the fires and floods
From the fires and floods
Today's people have left behind
Today's people
Who's gonna tell
The children of destiny
That we didn't try to save the world for them?
The children of the fires and floods
The human race is on
We're all lined up at the starting gun
The crowd is rising to its feet
Who's gonna save
The human race?
Where are the children gonna run and hide?
The children of the fires and floods
From the fires and floods
Today's people have left behind
Today's people
Child like a flower
That rose and fell
Back to the earth as it turned to hell
Today's people
From the flames and the waves
Today's people have left behind
Today's people
Today's people
Today's people
Today's peopleEmbed
