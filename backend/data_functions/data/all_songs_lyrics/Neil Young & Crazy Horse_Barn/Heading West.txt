Heading West Lyrics
When I was a little boy
Pulled my wagon all through the town
Went fishin' at the mill
Got home before the streetlights came on

Out behind my house
I used to go back to the railroad track
Put my ear down on the rail
Listen for the train to come back

I was almost in my teens
Mom and Daddy went their separate ways
My brother stayed when we left that day
Heading west to find the good old days

Good old days, good old days
Headin' West to find the good old days
Riding with mommy in her little car

Sometimes it feels alright
Livin' in a western town
Mommy got me my first guitar

Good old days, good old days
HÐµadin' West to find the good old days
Mommy got me my first guitarEmbed
