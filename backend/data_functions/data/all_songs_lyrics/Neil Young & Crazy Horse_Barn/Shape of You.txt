Shape of You Lyrics
This ain't just a paint-by-numbers
I gotta be who I feel
When I think of the shape of you

You changed my life for the better
Wore my love like your favorite sweater
That brings me back to the shape of you

Shape of you, shape of you
Shape of you

No reason to pretend different
It's just that I'm still dreaming
And my dreams all have you
The shape of you

Yeah, I'm older now, but I'm still dreaming
The sky is what I believe in
Stars scatter in the shape of you

Yeah, you're in my Milky Way
That's really all that I can say
When I think of the shape of you
Shape of you, shape of you
Shape of you

Shape of you, shape of you
Shape of youEmbed
