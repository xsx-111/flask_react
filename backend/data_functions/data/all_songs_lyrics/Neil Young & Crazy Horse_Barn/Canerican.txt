Canerican LyricsI am American, American is what I am
I cast my vote and now I got my man
Out on the range, I see the changes comin' to this country
I am American, American is what I am
(American)
I am American, American is what I am
I was born in Canada, came south to join a band
Got caught up in the big time, travellin' through the land
Up on the stage, I see the changes comin' to this country
I am Canerican, Canerican is what I am
I am all colors, all colors is what I am
Stand beside my brother for freedom in this land
Out on the range, I see the changes comin' to this country
I am all colors, all colors is what I am
(American)
I am American, American is what I amEmbed
