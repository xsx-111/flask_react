Song of the Seasons Lyrics
Looking through a wavy glass window
In this old place by the lake
And the colors of the falling leaves
I see nature makes no mistake
In the water as it ripples in the wind
There's a message I see of what's to come
In the honkers flying low above the waves
What's the reason this song is sung?

Song of the seasons coming through me now
Like the wind in your hair
We're so together in the way that we feel
That we could wind up anywhere

Looking through this clear vinyl window
At the city and its lights
As pеople are walking evеrywhere
It's humanity in my sights
From over there I see you waving at me
I feel the lightness in your step
I see the flicker of your loving eyes
In the stories our love has kept
Song of the seasons coming through me now
Like the wind in your hair
We're so together in the way that we feel
That we could end up anywhere

I see the palace where the queen still reigns
Behind her walls and lonesome gates
The king is gone down and she remains
I feel her banner's rippling in the rain
Here in this water as it gathers now upon the road
The horses gait in the rhythm I feel somehow
And the melody I play

Song of the seasons coming through me now
Like the wind in your hair
We're so together in the way that we feel
That we could end up anywhereEmbed
