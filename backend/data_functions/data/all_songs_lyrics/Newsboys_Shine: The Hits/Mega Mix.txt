Mega Mix LyricsWooHoo!
Shine!
Make 'em wonder what you've got
Make 'em wish that they were not
On the outside looking bored
Shine!
Let it shine before all men
Let 'em see good works, and then
Let 'em glorify the Lord

And the people sing
Shine

Isabelle is a belly dancer with a kleptomaniac's restraint
Tried stealing Helena's hand basket, made a fast getaway
But McQueen she ain't
At the courtroom, Joshua judges her ruthlessly on account of Ruth walking out on him
In the Big House, Isabelle is a-telling all to the chaplain, who's become her friend
She says:
I don't know why you care
I don't know what's out there
I don't know how it's done
Just take me to your leader, son
I see you've got the joy
I've seen you live it, boy
It's real, it's free, it's fun
So take me to your leader, son
Take me to your leader, son
Take me to your leader, son
Take me to your leader, son
Hold the milk, put back the sugar
They are powerless to console
We've gathered here to sprinkle ashes
From our late friend's cereal bowl
Breakfast Clubbers, say the motto
That he taught us to repeat:
"You will lose it in your gym class
If you wait 'til noon to eat."
Back when the chess club said our eggs were soft
Every Monday he'd say grace and hold our juice aloft
Oh, none of us knew his checkout time would come so soon
But before his brain stopped waving, he composed this tune:
When the toast is burned
And all the milk has turned
And Captain Crunch is waving farewell
When the Big One finds you
May this song remind you
That they don't serve breakfast in hell
When the toast is burned
And all the milk has turned
And Captain Crunch is waving farewell
When the Big One finds you
May this song remind you
That they don't serve breakfast in hell
In reality that comes from above
God is calling
There's no bigger love
It's His reality that welcomes us back
Trust and obey
There is no other way
In reality that comes from above
God is calling
There's no bigger love
It's His reality that welcomes us back
Trust and obey
There is no other way
No other way
There is no other way
Entertaining angels
By the light of my t.v. screen
24-7, You wait for me
Entertaining angels
By the time I fall to my knees
Host of heaven, sing over me
Entertaining angels
(Ohhhhhhhhh)
By the light of my t.v. screen
(Ohhhhhhhhh)
24-7, You wait for me
Entertaining angels
(Ohhhhhhhhh. Cover me, Lord.)
By the time I fall to my knees
(Stand by me. Stand by me.)
Host of heaven, sing over me
Stand by me
Stand by me
Stand by me
Stand by me
Stand by me
