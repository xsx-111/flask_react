Who? LyricsHow you gonna reckon with a God like this?
When you gonna face what you can't dismiss?
Whatcha gonna say to the... Soul Kiss that is my God?
Fearsome like the sag in a fat man's chair?
Sweeter than a patch of Rogaine hair?
How do you define what you can't compare?
This is... My God
And there's no use explaining what can't be contained
Chours 1
I'm not following a God I can lead around
I Can't tame this deity
That's why Jesus is the final answer
To Who I want my God to be!
He's Who (I want my God to be...)
How you gonna reckon with a God this Great?
Why you gonna measure what you can't equate?
Whatcha gonna say to the... Checkmate that is my God?
Stronger than the burn of an aftershave?
Tender as a burger in the microwave, rarer than the air in an empty grave?
This is... My God
And there's no use explaining what can't be contained
(Chours 1)
How we gonna work this out?
To fabricate a God like this?
No doubt
We'd end up worshipping a Christ of our own design
But Jesus doesn't fit that profile
His ways aren't mine
I'm not following A God that's imagined!
Can't invent his deity
That's why Jesus is the final answer
To who I want my God to be
He's Who I want my God to be!Embed
