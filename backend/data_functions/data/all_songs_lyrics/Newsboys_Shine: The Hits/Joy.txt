Joy LyricsYou give me joy that's unspeakable
And I like it, and I like it, yeah
Your love for me is irresistible
I can't fight it, I can't fight it, yeah
If life is water, I was dry as the Tucson dirt
If it's a gamble, I'd already lost my shirt
If it's a journey, I was dazed without a clue
I flipped a "U" back to the first love I ever knew
You give me joy that's unspeakable
And I like it, and I like it, yeah
Your love for me is irresistible
I can't fight it, I can't fight it, yeah
You carried the cross and took my shame
I believe it, I believe it, yeah
You shine your light of amazing grace
I receive it, I receive it, yeah
If life's a battle, the invasion is complete
If it's a rhythm, I have found the perfect beat
If it's a renaissance, I've got a new birthday
The world don't give it
And the world can't take it away
You give me joy that's unspeakable
And I like it, and I like it , yeah
Your love for me is irresistible
I can't fight it, I can't fight it, yeah
You carried the cross and took my shame
I believe it, I believe it, yeah
You shine your light of amazing grace
I receive it, I receive it, yeah
I'm bowed and broken, everything's new
All that I need, you're like water to seed
And how your love, rights everything wrong
And In my weakness
You're ever stronger, You're pulling me back
Where I belong
You give me joy that's unspeakable
And I like it, and I like it , yeah
Your love for me is irresistible
I can't fight it, I can't fight it, yeah
You carried the cross and took my shame
I believe it, I believe it, yeah
You shine your light of amazing grace
I receive it, I receive it, yeah
You give me joy that's unspeakable
And I like it, and I like it , yeah
Your love for me is irresistible
I can't fight it, I can't fight it, yeah
You carried the cross and took my shame
I believe it, I believe it, yeah
You shine your light of amazing grace
I receive it, I receive it, yeah
You give me joy that's unspeakable
And I like it, and I like it , yeah
Your love for me is irresistible
I can't fight it, I can't fight it, yeah
You carried the cross and took my shame
I believe it, I believe it, yeahEmbed
