Spirit Thing Lyrics
It's not a family trait
It's nothing that I ate
And it didn't come from skating with Holy Rollers
It's an early warning sign
It keeps my life in line
But it's so hard to define
Nevermind

It's just a spirit thing
It's just a holy nudge
It's like a circuit judge in the brain
It's just a spirit thing
It's here to guard my heart
It's just a little hard to explain

It pushes when I quit
It smells a counterfeit
Sometimes it works a bit like a teleprompter
When it's teleprompting you
I pray you'll let it through
And I'll help you with the how
But for now
It's just a spirit thing
It's just a holy nudge
It's like a circuit judge in the brain
It's just a spirit thing
It's here to guard my heart
It's just a little hard to explain


(I took the pulpit)
I took the pulpit
(Then backed down again)
Then backed down again
(Some things in heaven)
Some things in heaven
(Cannot be explained)
No, they cannot be explained

Yeah, it's just a spirit thing
(I took the soapbox)
It's just a holy nudge
It's like a circuit judge in the brain
(Then backed down again)
It's just a spirit thing
(Some things in heaven)
It's here to guard my heart
It's just a little hard to explain
(Cannot be explained)
Yeah, it's just a spirit thing
(Oh, I took the airwaves)
It's just a holy nudge
It's like a circuit judge in the brain
(Then backed down again)
It's just a spirit thing
(Some things in heaven)
It's here to guard my heart
It's just a little hard to explain
(Cannot be explained, no)

It's just a spirit thing
(Oh, I took the pulpit)
It's just a holy nudge
It's like a circuit judge in the brain
(Then backed down again)
It's just a spirit thing
(Some things in heaven)
It's here to guard my heart
It's just a little hard to explain
(Cannot be explained, no)Embed
