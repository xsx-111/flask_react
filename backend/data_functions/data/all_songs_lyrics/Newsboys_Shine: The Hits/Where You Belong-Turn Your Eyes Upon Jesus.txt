Where You Belong/Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus Lyrics
When you're dull from all that glitters
When your thoughts have a hollow ring
When you can“ët escape from the feeling
You're getting it wrong
All your foolproof plans seem foolish
All your status is status quo
All you really need to know
Is where you belong

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in his wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace

I was used to the cold for so long
That couldn't feel anything
And I shivered and stared like a beggar
Who won't lift his hands
I was numb until he touched me
I was deaf until he heard
I was senseless 'til I met the one
Who understands
