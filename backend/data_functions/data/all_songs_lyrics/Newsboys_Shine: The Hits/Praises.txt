Praises LyricsTears have fallen water beads
Wipe the floor with my regrets
In the crevice tiny seeds
Spring to life from
Pardoned debts
And all I have is, all I have
Praise on my tounge
From my heart
For our God who became flesh
For us all
Unto You
I will sing my praises
Sing forever
In the quiet I lament
Every nail, my sin did buy
And I wonder why you spent
Lavish blood on such as I
When all I have is, all I have
Praises on my tounge
From my heart
For our God who became flesh
For us all
Unto You
I will ever sing my praises
I will sing forever
Oh, for a thousand
Tounges to sing
To sing aloud
Sing aloud
Oh, to the glory
Of my God and King
To sing aloud
Sing aloudEmbed
