Eleanor Rigby Lyrics(Instrumental interlude 0:00 - 3:07)

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Picked up the rice in a church
Where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits by a window
Wearing the face that she keeps
In a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong? (Look at all the lonely people)

Father McKenzie
Darning his socks in the night
When there's nobody there
What does he care?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words to a sermon
That no one will hear
No one comes near
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong? (look at all the lonely people)

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Died in that church and was buried
Along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands
As he walked from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people (All the lonely people)
Where do they all come from? (Where do they all come from)
All the lonely people (All the lonely people) (Where do they)
Where do they all come from? (Where do they all come from)
All the lonely people (All the lonely people)  (Where do they)
Where do they all come from? (Where do they all come from)
All the lonely people  (All the lonely people) (Where do they)
Where do they all come from? (Do they, do they, do they, do they)
Do they all come from? (Do they, do they, do they, do they)
Do they all come from? (Do they, do they, do they, do they)
Do they all come from? (Do they, do they, do they, do they)
Do they all come from? (Do they, do they, do they, do they)
Do they all come from? (Do they, do they, do they, do they)
Do they all come? (Do they, do they)
Nothing is real
Nothing to get hung about1Embed
