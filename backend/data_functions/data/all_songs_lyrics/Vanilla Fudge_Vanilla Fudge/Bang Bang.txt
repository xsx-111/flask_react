Bang Bang Lyrics

Ring around the roses
A pocket full of posies
We all, fall, down
A-tisket a-tasket
A green and yellow basket
We are all wrapped up and on our way
 a letter for my love
I know Sonny's girlfriend


I was five, you were six
We rode on horses made of sticks (Shh)
She wore black and I wore white
I'd always let her win the fight

Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down
Seasons came and changed the time
I grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say
Remember how we used to play

Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang
But for me, the church bells rang
Now she's gone, I don't know why
Until this day, sometimes I cry
She didn't even say good bye
She didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
