Ticket to Ride LyricsI think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She don't care
She says that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She don't care
Don't know why she's riding so high
Oughta think twice
Oughta to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
Oughta think twice
She ought to do right by me
She said "I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah"
The girl that's driving me mad she's going away, oh
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She don't care
Don't know why she's riding so high
She gotta think twice
She oughta do right by me (when she gets home)
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She oughta think twice
She oughta do right by me
She saya that living with me has brought her down, yeah
She said she would never be free when I was around, hey
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't careEmbed
