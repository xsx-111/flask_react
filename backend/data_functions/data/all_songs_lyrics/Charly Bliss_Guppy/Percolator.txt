Percolator Lyrics
Come on, baby, get me high
There's always something new to buy
I cry all the time, I think that it's cool
I'm in touch with my feelings
I have always loved the door
But I will always love you more
I love metaphors, swimming in your pool

I am pregnant with meaning
Could I be more appealing
Writing slurs on the ceiling?
Come on, baby, you're bleeding

I'm gonna die in a getaway car
I haven't tried, but it sounds too har-ar-ar-ar-ar-ard


I'm not scared to lick the floor
'Cause I have sucked on something worse
Straight from the adored, myself over yours?
C'mon, baby, keep dreaming
Don't you know I aim to please?
I'm everybody's favorite tease
Put your hand on my knee, that's what friends are for
Well, I think I'm still breathing
While my parents are sleeping
I am sick, but I'm speaking
My boyfriend is freaking
My conscious is fucked and my judgement is leaking and

I'm gonna die in a getaway car
I haven't tried, but it sounds too hard
All of my friends never understand
You say that I make you feel like a manEmbed
