Glitter Lyrics
Hellmouth boy, my vacant queen
Glitter in between my teeth
Here we gather at your feet
Speak himself to sunken sleep
Can't stop shitting where you eat
You're a joke or I'm just mean
I can't cum and I can't lie
I can't stop making myself cry

I'll have my cake and eat it too
I wish I could be good to you

Am I the best? (Ah)
Or just the first person (To say yes)
The best? (Ah)
Or just the first person (To say yes)
The best? (Ah)
Or just the first person (To say yes)
The best? (Ah)
Or just the first person
To say—

Like a husband loves a wife
Every day and every night
Milk my brain and take my life
Everything we say is right
Little monkey up your sleeve
Kiss each other, make a scene
"We're all slaves to fame, I guess"
Push me down, put on your dress

I'll have my cake and eat it too
I wish I could be good to you

Am I the best? (Ah)
Or just the first person (To say yes)
The best? (Ah)
Or just the first person (To say yes)
The best? (Ah)
Or just the first person (To say yes)
The best? (Ah)
Or just the first person
To say—

Am I the best? (Ah)
Or just the first person (To say yes)
The best? (Ah)
Or just the first person (To say yes)
The best? (Ah)
Or just the first person (to say yes)
The best? (Ah)
Or just the first person
To say—2Embed
