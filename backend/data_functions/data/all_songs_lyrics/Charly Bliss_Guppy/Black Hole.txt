Black Hole Lyrics
She's got her toe in the cornhole
Bleeding out in a snow cone
Lost my will to the black hole
Stuck my gum on his soul
Smoke the last of the bad pot
Listen in on your last thought
Will to live or a life lost
Bury me in the bad box

Take me on a date
Take me anywhere, was I insane?
Purple in the face
Laughing all the way home, I thought
Burn me at the stake
Leave me anywhere, was I insane?
Purple in the face
Laughing all the way home, I thought

She's got her toe in the cornhole
Bleeding out in a snow cone
Lost my will to the black hole
Stuck my gum on his soul
Take me on a date
Take me anywhere, was I insane?
Purple in the face
Laughing all the way home, I thought
Burn me at the stake
Leave me anywhere, was I insane?
Purple in the face
Laughing all the way home, I thought


Take me on a date
Take me anywhere, was I insane?
Purple in the face
Laughing all the way home, I thought
Burn me at the stake
Leave me anywhere, was I insane?
Purple in the face
Laughing all the way home, I thought

She's got her toe in the cornhole
Bleeding out in a snow cone
Lost my will to the black hole
Stuck my gum on his soul
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ahEmbed
