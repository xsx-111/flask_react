Scare U Lyrics
Forced fun, ill at ease
All I eat is bread and cheese
Pink elf, bleed the sheets
I wanna talk about it, but I don't know what I mean

I don't wanna scare you
I don't wanna share you

Yellow flavoring
Sticky forehead, gummy skin
Sad sack, smell of weed
Now I only see you when I need to fall asleep
Supermodel friend
Little virgin, take a hint
Pink elf, brush your teeth
I wanna sell you on it, but I don't know what I mean

I don't wanna scare you
I don't wanna share you

I can't touch it (I can't let go)
I can't touch it (I can almost)
I can't touch it (I can't let go)
I can't touch it (I can almost)
Forced fun, ill at ease
All I eat is bread and cheese
Pink elf, bleed the sheets
I wanna talk about it, talk about it, talk about it

I don't wanna scare you
I don't wanna share you
I don't wanna scare you
I don't wanna share youEmbed
