Julia Lyrics
Julia draws me flat
But I don't really look like that
Paper muscles close the door
I watch her like it's softcore porn

We have built a life together
I say how to make you better

Julia, ah-ah
Julia
Julia
Julia
Julia

Julia is on the phone
She never has to be alone
She'll race me, but I can't compete
I missed by like a thousand feet

We have built a life together
Don't just laugh and say, "Whatever"
Julia, ah-ah
Julia
Julia
Julia
Julia

And if that's what it's about, I'll sleep on the couch
I know that you're afraid
They call your mom to ask if your mind's made up
Julia

Julia, Julia
Julia
Julia
Julia
Julia
