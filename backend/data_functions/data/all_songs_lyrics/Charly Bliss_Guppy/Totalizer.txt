Totalizer Lyrics
Kiss me by the black rack
I smell your Chapstick on the talkback
My friends forgot my number
Oh well, I wished for you to come first

Some things happen fast (Like when you're asking for it)
He lives under glass (And couldn't hear you through it)
Baby, make it last (I wasn't ready for it)

Kiss me under contract
You'd sell my soul to make a comeback
Take me back

Some things happen fast (Like when you're asking for it)
He lives under glass (And couldn't hear you through it)
Baby, make it last (I wasn't ready for it)


Kiss me by the black rack
I smell your Chapstick on the talkback
My friends forgot my number
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well!
Some things happen fast (Like when you're asking for it)
He lives under glass (And couldn't hear you through it)
Baby, make it last (I wasn't ready for it)Embed
