Westermarck Lyrics
Cardboard cereal eating me inside
From across your room, I saw
Second cousins kissing on the lawn
We will never speak again

Would you believe me if I was right? (I was right)
Scar on your face from the birthday fight (Birthday fight)
I want to touch you, I want to cry (Want to cry)
Floating above you, I think I might

Twenty-three and your knee is gonna blow
It's so weird to be on the—
Outside, hulking out, seething in the yard
Now, I bite my hair and think:
I hate looking at you now
'Cause I can't get over it

Would you believe me if I was right? (I was right)
Scar on your face from the birthday fight (Birthday fight)
I want to touch you, I want to cry (Want to cry)
Floating above you, I think I might
We can get along, sweet golden dog
Had to wait so long for a sister
Plane is taking off, follow the thought
Baby's gonna pop, so I shrink her
We can get along, sweet golden dog (Westermarck)
Had to wait so long for a sister (I can't hear you)
Plane is taking off, follow the thought (Westermarck)
Baby's gonna pop


Would you believe me if I was right? (I was right)
Scar on your face from the birthday fight (Birthday fight)
I want to touch you, I want to cry (Want to cry)
Floating above you, I think I might

(Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah)

Plane is taking off, follow the thought
Baby's gonna pop, so I shrink her
We can get along, sweet golden dog (Westermarck)
Had to wait so long for a sister (I can't hear—)Embed
