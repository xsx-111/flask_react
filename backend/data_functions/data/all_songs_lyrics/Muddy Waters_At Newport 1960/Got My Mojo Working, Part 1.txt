Got My Mojo Working, Part 1 Lyrics
Got my mojo working but it just won't work on you
Got my mojo working but it just won't work on you
I want to love you so bad, I don't know what to do

Going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
Going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I'm going to have all you women, getcha under my command

Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working but it just won't work on you


I got a gypsy woman giving me advice
I got a gypsy woman giving me advice
I got a whole lot of tricks keeping here on ice1Embed
