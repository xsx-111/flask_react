Goodbye Newport Blues LyricsOh what a gloomy day in Newport
Everything is sad sad sad
Yes, what a gloomy day in Newport
Everything is sad sad sad
You know it's a gloomy day in Newport
One of the worst of times I ever had
What's gonna happen to my music?
What's gonna happen to this song?
What's gonna happen to my music?
What's gonna happen to my song?
This is a hard, hard world to live in
And it'll be here all along
Too down in my own tears
My feet are hittin these all day blues
Yeah, just might be a little hint to all these blues
But you never see me frown
So you just pick up on the latest news
I got to keep singin these blues
Yes, I got to keep singin my song
Yes I got to keep singin these blues
Hey mamma keep singin my song
Those sad sad sad sad sad sad sad...
Sad sad goodbye...
Newport goodbye
Oh goodbye
