Unspoken Words LyricsThere’s a silent demon whispering inside my head
And I keep on wondering why I have to feel this bad, oh
Good and evil forces battling inside my chest
And opposing thoughts are loudly breaking off my rest
I'm imploding, my mind’s corroding
This wall of silence is suddenly falling
The wind is blowing, the lightning is coming
I cannot refrain no more
Now take heed for me
You will realize this is
The calm before the storm
Of the feelings untold
Listen to me, in the end
And don’t tell me I’m to blame
There’s something you should know
Can you hear my unspoken words?
I don’t know if what I’m going to say is right or wrong
I just cannot hush my mouth, I can’t take no more
I’m sure I will feel much better when this silence breaks
I’ll get rid of this heavy burden pushing on my neck
I'm imploding, my mind’s corroding
This wall of silence is suddenly falling
The wind is blowing, the lightning is coming
I’m losing my self-control
Now take heed for me
You will realize this is
The calm before the storm
Of the feelings untold
Listen to me, in the end
And don’t tell me I’m to blame
There’s something you should know
Can you hear my unspoken words?
(Now take heed for me)
(You will realize this is)
The calm before the storm
Of the feelings untold
Listen to me, in the end
And don’t tell me I’m to blame
There’s something you should know
Can you hear my unspoken words?1Embed
