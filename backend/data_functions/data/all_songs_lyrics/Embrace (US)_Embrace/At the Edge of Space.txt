At the Edge of Space LyricsElements, they react and change their state
Everything keeps on evolving even if no one observes
Galaxies, they are moving their own way
They’re rotating and colliding with a sound no one can hear
There are mountains, valleys, rocks and water
Black holes, comets and so much more
Crossing all the oceans and heading for the stars
There’s no sorrow, there is no care, they’re left all behind
Nothing is forever, I’m just a little speck
In this chemical infinity, there is no rest
And I know I have to change my point of view
Reconsidering my choices and resuming my own truth
From above many problems seem futile
Most of questions are unworthy and they’re just a waste of time
Crossing all the oceans and heading for the stars
There’s no sorrow, there is no care, they’re left all behind
Nothing is forever, I’m just a little speck
In this chemical infinity, there is no rest
I simply don’t care
I’m so far away (I simply don’t care) from the earth
I can stare at sun without my eyes hurting!
Matter, dark matter and dark energy
The secrets not unraveled yet, there’s so much to discover
And I want to know, ‘cause the earth embraces us all!
Crossing all the oceans and heading for the stars
There’s no sorrow, there is no care, they’re left all behind
Nothing is forever, I’m just a little speck
In this chemical infinity, there is no rest
Exploring other planets and looking through the sky
There is no annoying problem that is worth my time
Place here is forever, believe it or not
I am reaching the lucidity, I need to go onEmbed
