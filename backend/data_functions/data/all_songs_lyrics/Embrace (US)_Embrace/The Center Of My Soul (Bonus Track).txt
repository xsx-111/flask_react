The Center Of My Soul (Bonus Track) Lyrics
A great adventure as began in your hands
And everything  me to you
The story told to better path
They created without dreams
We're young and full of energy

From the sound of California
To the center of my soul
Every world are you told me
Travel from ours seem to me
People told you back the future
But don't you worry the future is now
For the day they can tears
I have you waiting here
Thinking of you


Ouou, I got an answer
Right the tells a comе with me
Why use life likе me
Please, can hear in the end
(here in the end)
I never forget you
I always remember
Now I can hear you
The share is free foreverEmbed
