Advice from a Caterpillar LyricsShe thought it was an afternoon
Just alike the other ones
Weary in the grass she laid
Picking daisies under the sun
She sat down on the grass
Then  she peeped into a book
And the weather was so hot
She was getting bored, oh yeah
A rabbit with pink eyes
Started running close by her
Shortly after she heard it saying
“Oh, dear! I shall be too late!”
(I shall be too late)
She realized
That it could actually talk
But the oddest thing it was
It was staring at its clock
“And so now the tale is done
And home we steer, a merry crew
Beneath the setting sun.”
Pilgrims plucked in a far-off land
Shrinking and then growing tall
Trying to find her way back home
Nothing there seemed to be clear
So she drowned in a pool of tears
“And so now the tale is done
And home we steer, a merry crew
All beneath the setting sun.”
Pilgrims plucked in a far-off land
“Follow me! Wake up! Why?
We are all mad here!
Follow me! Wake up! Why?
We are all mad here!
Follow me! Wake up! Why?
We are all mad here!”
A duchess, a hatter
A grinning Cheshire cat
The mushroom that I ate
Will make me shrink or grow?
The queen keeps on saying
“Off, off with her head”
The frog and the fish-footman
Don’t want me to come in
La-la-la...
La-la-la...
La-la-la...
La-la-la...
La-la-la...
La-la-la...
I cannot find my way home
I am exploring this strange, odd world
The blue caterpillar asked who am I
But I don’t know, don’t know no more...
“...Begin at the beginning...
...And go on until you go to the end...”
“Wake up, oh Alice dear!
What a long sleep you had”
“I’ve had a curious dream
I’m gonna tell you right now
Tell you right now
A duchess, a rat and
A grinning Cheshire cat...”
“And so now the tale is done
And home we steer, a merry crew
All beneath the setting sun.”
