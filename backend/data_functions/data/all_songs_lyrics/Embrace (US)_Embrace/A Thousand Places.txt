A Thousand Places LyricsIt’s early, I’m awake – in the darkness I stare
Well, I can’t remember the name of this new place
It’s funny when it happens and you do not have a clue
It makes you realize you are alive
One million lights are shining bright
So many faces I do not know
A thousand places I want to see
This is a secret to break free
Walking down the streets I can breathe the thick air
Then suddenly the desert is here
And when I’m getting used to the city I’m in
I will not stay, the world awaits
Here it comes the day that I’m leaving again
I am always amazed by new colors and scenes
Every land’s so different from the previous that I’ve seen
Different words and different ideas
One million lights are shining bright
So many faces I do not know
A thousand places I want to see
This is a secret to break free
Walking down the streets I can breathe the thick air
Then suddenly the desert is here
And when I’m getting used to the city I’m in
I will not stay, the world awaits
(Oh... oh... oh...)
(Oh... oh... oh...)
Oh...Embed
