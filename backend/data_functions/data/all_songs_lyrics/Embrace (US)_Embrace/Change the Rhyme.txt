Change the Rhyme LyricsI’ve always tried to be aware
But, you know, it’s not always easy
I often stop and meditate
I hesitate (I hesitate)
And I forget where I have been
And I breathe out, then I breathe in
But underneath my feet I feel
The cold ground (ground)
Time and again I face my past
Voices and colors dwell in my heart
And step by step I’ve got to know
That “better” for me is never enough
Sometimes I wish I could rewind
All my life and change the rhyme
I’ve always thought “I’ll be prepared”
But, you know, it’s never easy
I often stop and wait alone
All alone, all alone
Time and again (time and again) I face my past
Voices and colors dwell in my heart
And step by step (and step by step) I’ve got to know
That “better” for me is never enough
Sometimes I wish I could rewind
All my life and change the rhyme
The surface can hide so much
But inside the scars still hurt
So many memories have dies
Buried deep inside my mind
I’d never let them re-emerge
Every new day just feeds my soul
I know the best has yet to come
This is the reason to go on!
Time and again I face my past
Voices and colors dwell in my heart
And step by step I’ve got to know
That “better” for me is never enough
Time and again I let it go
But above all the present is gold
And in the end I’ve got to know
That “perfect” for me is never enough
Sometimes I wish that I could see
Myself, the way I move and speak
With the eyes of someone else...Embed
