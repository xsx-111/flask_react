Fragments of Life LyricsAwakened by the tempest
I can see your heart's in the shade
And it feels so safe here
Hold me tight so that I can feel
Your heartbeat
Why can’t we just lay down
Whispering love songs with no sound?
But there’s always something
Keeping you and me far apart
And I would erase
Any distance between us
And I love you so that I hate you every time that you leave
It is hard to handle this affliction so bittersweet
Because when you hug me there’s no space and there is no time
Happiness is for real only in those fragments of life
Hold me close to your heart
Letting all the seasons pass by
But in time I will get used
I’m learning to love you from afar
But I still can’t stand
Any distance between us
And I love you so that I hate you every time that you leave
It is hard to handle this affliction so bittersweet
When we separate I feel broken
Just another taste and then go
You are everything that I dream for
You remind me I’m alive
And I love you so that I hate you every time that you leave
It is hard to handle this affliction so bittersweet
Because when you hug me there’s no space and there is no time
Happiness is for real only in those fragments of lifeEmbed
