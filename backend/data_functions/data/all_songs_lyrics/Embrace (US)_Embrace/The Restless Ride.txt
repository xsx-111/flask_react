The Restless Ride LyricsSignals are clear we have to go
Leaving the ground of and emptied earth
It’s too hard to admit we’re wrong
We have to leave it now
The sky is the limit of our greedy race
A human swarm, a desperate shot
The last chance to live on
Now reach out for the starry dome
You will know the meaning of those lights above
After all, we are light speed trails chasing a distant sun
Heading to what lies deep in the unknown
Now, we cleave an endless sea of night
Every single second, every scar upon our flesh
Through the void and among the stars
We try to sow our seeds to gain a second chance oh...
Looking back to our lone and blue dot
Heading for a new place to call home
Silent shades around cheering our restless ride
Why have we never thought to save our lives?
We’ve lived too much beyond our means
Our sons will blame us for what we have done
To the blue jewel we’ve left behind
Without a shepherd to guide our way
To achieve the world that they deserve
Now reach out for the starry dome
You will know the meaning of those lights above
After all, we are light speed trails chasing a distant sun
Heading to what lies deep in the unknown
Now, we cleave an endless sea of night
Every single second, every scar upon our flesh
Through the void and among the stars
We try to sow our seeds to gain a second chance oh...
Looking back to our lone and blue dot
Heading for a new place to call home
Silent shades around cheering our restless ride
Why have we never thought to save our lives?
We’ve lived too much beyond our means
Saviors, we’ve waited a thousands years
Under a veil of dust and broken hopes
Groping into our deepest dark
Dazed amid mires and stars
The curtain has fallen on our previous crimes
A childish game without a prize
We have to leave and say goodbye
(Pollution, delusion and a deadly famine)
Deathbringers will share war
Dry rivers and boiling oceans
It’s only our fault, redemption lies ahead
Into the night...
Into the night...
Into the night...
Ego Alpha Et Omega
Primus Et Novissimus
Principium Et Finis
Black holes, cosmic graves wait
To split our souls in twain!
Breaking veils of fire, over come fears
We’re forever gone!
We’re forever gone, oh yeah
Now look at the sky once more
You will know the meaning of those lights above
Out of sight, the fading stairways chasing a distant sun
Heading to what lies in the dark
Now, we cleave an endless sea of night
Every single second, every scar upon our flesh
Through the void and among the stars
We try to sow our seeds to gain a second chance oh...
Looking back to our lone and blue dot
Heading for a new place to call home
Silent shades around cheering our restless ride
Why have we never thought to save our lives?
We’ve lived too much beyond!
Now, we cleave an endless sea of night
Every single second, every scar upon our flesh
Through the void and among the stars
We try to sow our seeds to gain a second chance oh...
Looking back to our lone and blue dot
Heading for a new place to call home
Silent shades around cheering our restless ride
Why have we never thought to save our lives?
We’ve lived too much beyond our means, oh...
(Through the void and among the stars)
(Through the void and among the stars) oh...
(Through the void and among the stars)
(Through the void and among the stars)
Oh...Embed
