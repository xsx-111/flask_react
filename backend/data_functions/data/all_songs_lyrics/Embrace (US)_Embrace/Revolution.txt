Revolution LyricsWe’re gonna tell very loud
Anything that’s gonna pass through our minds
No constraints, no regrets
We’re unleashing any primitive force
And it is the time to stand up and write a story
Of freedom and pride
Here it all begins
And nothing can stand in our way or pull us under
We won’t be the same and everything is gonna change
This is revolution! (Revolution!)
Revolution! (Revolution!)
For sure we are prepared to see the world turned upside down
In this revolution... (Revolution!)
Revolution! (Revolution!)
Revolution!
Revolution!
Revolution!
Revolution!
We’re gonna shout, gonna cry
Everyone is gonna hear our own words
No taboos, no excuse
We’re unleashing any primitive thought
And it is the time to stand up and write a story
Of freedom and pride
We won’t be the same and everything is gonna change
This is revolution! (Revolution!)
Revolution! (Revolution!)
For sure we are prepared to see the world upside down
In this revolution... (Revolution!)
Revolution! (Revolution!)
We sit down here quiet, ready to fight
To free the stream of our own creative minds
We will satisfy our need to make noise
We sit down here quiet, ready to fight
To free the stream of our own creative minds
We will satisfy our need to make noise
And to play our notes
We won’t be the same and everything is gonna change
This is revolution! (Revolution!)
Revolution! (Revolution!)
For sure we are prepared to see the world upside down
In this revolution... (Revolution!)
Revolution!
We won’t be the same and everything is gonna change
This is revolution! (Revolution!)
Revolution! (Revolution!)
For sure we are prepared to see the world upside down
In this revolution... (Revolution!)
Revolution! (Revolution!)
(Revolution!) Revolution!
(Revolution!) Revolution!Embed
