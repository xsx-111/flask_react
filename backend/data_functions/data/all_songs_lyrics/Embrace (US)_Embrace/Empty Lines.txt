Empty Lines LyricsI’ve to face it everyday
Always a new choice to make
I’m so sick to be distressed
By the thoughts inside my head
There must be a light at the end
Of the tunnel of my brain
I’ve to focus on my aim:
To bring calm inside myself
Something’s missing, something’s wrong
Dark clouds are getting close
I’ve been waiting for too long!
I have looked for another melody
For new notes to complete my symphony
For the words to fulfill and write those empty lines
And I know, I can’t waste my energy
‘Cause I used to be my own enemy...
The war that I could never win
I’ve to treasure what I’ve found
And I have to hold my ground
Step by step, a little more
Every second, I’m so close
It is hard, but it’s worthwhile
So it’s time to stand and fight
Never let others decide
For your life, and never hide
Something’s missing, something’s wrong
Dark clouds are getting close
I’ve been waiting for too long!
I have looked for another melody
For new notes to complete my symphony
For the words to fulfill and write those empty lines
And I know, I can’t waste my energy
‘Cause I used to be my own enemy...
The war that I could never win
Battling to conquer my inner peace
I’ve unleashed what it’s worth to be set free
So here I am...
I have looked for another melody
For new notes to complete my symphony
For the words to fulfill and write those empty lines
And I know, I can’t waste my energy
‘Cause I used to be my own enemy...
The war that I could never win
Battling to conquer my inner peace
I’ve unleashed what it’s worth to be set free
So here I am...Embed
