Haze LyricsSomeone’s in the mirror looking back with a silly face
Damn, I cannot stand that fake smile and that stare
When I walk away that reflection just disappears
And it does the same if I break out in tears
Oh what a day, there’s a stranger in my room
Acting just like me, I’ve got to say that we look alike
Go away and leave me alone
I don’t like your bad company
Now I try to close my eyes
But this bitter taste remains
And there’s nothing I can do to ease the pain
Black or white, sun or rain
I’m just having a bad day
Hopefully tomorrow all the haze will fade away
Uncontrolled reactions make me move like I’ve gone insane
Trembling and shaking, I cannot move my legs
Something’s going wrong so that I cannot see no more
So it feels like the floor opens under my feet
I cannot relax, I can’t carry so much distress
I am suffocating, have to take one more breath
There are many thoughts rolling over into my head
And the bad result is that I feel so sad
Oh what a day, all my plans turned upside-down
I can feel the poison burning in my every cell
Now I try to close my eyes
But this bitter taste remains
And there’s nothing I can do to ease the pain
Black or white, sun or rain
I’m just having a bad day
Hopefully tomorrow all the haze will fade away
Uncontrolled reactions make me move like I’ve gone insane
Trembling and shaking, I cannot move my legs
Something’s going wrong so that I cannot see no more
So it feels like the floor opens under my feet
I cannot relax, I can’t carry so much distress
I am suffocating, have to take one more breath
There are many thoughts rolling over into my head
And the bad result is that I feel so sad
I don’t wanna go insane
I’ve to calm down, take a break
It is time to change my ways
To put troubles aside
(Now I try to close my eyes)
I don’t wanna go insane
(But this bitter taste remains)
I’ve to calm down, take a break
(And there’s nothing I can do)
It is time to change my ways
(to ease the pain)
To put troubles aside
I just cannot see what the hell is happening to me
I don’t recognize the person that I seem to be
(Now I try to close my eyes)
Simply I don’t like the way I’m acting, it’s not like me
(But this bitter taste remains)
All this mess will cease to exist, I’ll let happiness in
Now I try to close my eyes
But this bitter taste remains
And there’s nothing I can do to ease the pain
Black or white, sun or rain
I’m just having a bad day
Hopefully tomorrow all the haze will fade away
Someone’s in the mirror looking back with a silly face
Damn, I cannot stand that fake smile and that stare
When I walk away that reflection just disappears
And it does the same if I break out in tears
I have lost my energy, I try but I cannot wake
Wasted so much time in running after my brain
I have realized there’s no place that I’d rather be
Because for today I cannot stand myselfEmbed
