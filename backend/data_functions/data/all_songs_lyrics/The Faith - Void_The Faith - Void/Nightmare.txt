Nightmare LyricsCan't get no sleep
I can't close my eyes
I never took the time
To realize
My mind could do
These things to me
Haunting tortures
Seem to really be
Twist and turn
Cringe and burn
Feel the pain inside of me
Suffering in agony
Wake up so cold
Your blood's the poison
Your body convulses
In endless motion
Eyes stare blindly
At the ceiling
Paralyzed by fear
Twist and turn
Cringe and burn
Feel the pain inside of me
Suffering in agonyEmbed
