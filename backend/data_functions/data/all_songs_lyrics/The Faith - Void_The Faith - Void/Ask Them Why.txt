Ask Them Why LyricsTell us how to act
Tell us where to go
Tell us what to do
Want me to be you?
We all live their lies
No one asks them why
We all live their lies
No one asks them why
Tell us how to act
Tell us what to do
Tell us where to go
Want me to be you?
We all live their lies
No one asks them why
We all live their lies
No one asks them whyEmbed
