Time to Die LyricsI'm so fucking filled with hate
I just need to decapitate
Just for kicks I need to kill
Everybody's got to get their thrills
I'll stain with world with your blood
I'll bury your bodies deep in the woods
Your feet are over here your hands over there
I'll never get caught so I don't care
It's time to die you're next
Time to die you're next
Time to die you're next
Time to die you're next
I'm so fucking filled with rage
I just need to decapitate
Just for kicks I need to kill
Everybody's got to get their thrills
I'll stain with world with your blood
I'll bury your bodies deep in the woods
Your feet are over here your hands over there
I'll never get caught so I don't care
It's time to die you're next
Time to die you're next
Time to die you're next
Time to die you're next
You're next!Embed
