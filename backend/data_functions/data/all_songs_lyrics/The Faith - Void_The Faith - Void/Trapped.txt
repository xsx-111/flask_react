Trapped LyricsYou sit around and talk
Behind each other's backs
The rumors get around
And you're left feeling down
All you'll ever be is trapped in your circles
Never want to be trapped in your circles
Every time I stop I see I'm trapped in your circles
You think you'll be safe
Hiding behind your friends
Remember nothing's real
About the way they feel
All you'll ever be is trapped in your circles
Never want to be trapped in your circles
Every time I stop I see I'm trapped in your circlesEmbed
