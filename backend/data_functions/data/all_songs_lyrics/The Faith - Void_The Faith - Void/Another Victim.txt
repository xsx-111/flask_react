Another Victim LyricsAnother victim of his age
Had to grow up in a hurry
Couldn't control his blinded rage
So fucked he didn't worry
Why hide from the truth? It's just another excuse
You're lying to yourself, just like everyone else
Why hide from the truth? It's just another excuse
You're lying to yourself, just like everyone else
It's not too late to make a change
Who cares if they don't understand
It's better if they think you're strange
Than dying to prove you're a real man
Live fast, die young, you're full of shit
Face the fact you're still a kid and learn to live with it
Live fast, die young, you're full of shit
Face the fact you're still a kid and learn to live with itEmbed
