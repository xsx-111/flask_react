Condensed Flesh LyricsCondensed was the flesh that the Nazis acquired
When they tore the bodies from the barbed wire
In Dachau they burned the cadavers to brown
Never escaping the terrible sounds of...
Condensed flesh, bubbling with heat
Condensed flesh, killed in glee
Condensed flesh, was their specialty
In chambers they shuffled women to die of gaseous vapors
Their children stood by
They took the flesh and put it in Campbell's cans
Now they have to face our deadly demands
Condensed flesh, bubbling with heat
Condensed flesh, killed in glee
Condensed flesh, was their specialtyEmbed
