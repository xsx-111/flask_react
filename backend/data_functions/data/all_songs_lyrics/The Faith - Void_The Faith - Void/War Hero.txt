War Hero LyricsGive me a gun, I know how to shoot
Give me some grenades and I'll be off soon
Don't wanna sit anymore, already got my boots
Fuck all the discipline, I just wanna kill
I want to die
In a war
I don't get scared about being drafted
I wanna go somewhere where they like me
I wanna fight but I don't wanna die
I want to die
In a war
I'm not worried about getting exploded
And coming home without my legs
Or losing a gun in the mud
But I don't care because it's fun
I want to die
In a warEmbed
