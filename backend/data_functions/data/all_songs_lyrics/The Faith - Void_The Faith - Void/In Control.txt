In Control LyricsCan you find it in yourself?
Or do you rely on someone else?
Is it really real to you?
Or just what the others do?
You say you're on your own
Self-reliant, in control
Independent with a goal
Do you really know?
You ask me what it is
It's what's in me and you
Self-control and attitude
It's how you feel about you
You say you're on your own
Self-reliant, in control
Independent with a goal
Do you really know?Embed
