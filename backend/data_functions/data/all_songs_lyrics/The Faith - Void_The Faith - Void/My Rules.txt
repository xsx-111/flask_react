My Rules LyricsEverywhere I go I see their rules
They're on the streets and in the schools
Authority says one thing for sure
Life can't be without structures
I'm not at the hand of their tools
I'm going to live by my rules
Why should I listen to those fools
I'm going to live by my rules
I was raised to respect their ways
Now they've got me caught in their maze
So many questions come up to me
But which one of us is the one to see?
I'm not at the hand of their tools
I'm going to live by my rules
Why should I listen to those fools?
I'm going to live by my rulesEmbed
