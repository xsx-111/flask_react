Ignorant People LyricsCall yourselves number one
Ha ha, we laugh in your faces
You're just another society
You require acceptance, too
Think you're individuals
But you're one in the same
You're just ignorant people
You hide behind your name
You're just ignorant people
You hide behind your name
Started out all right
But you got lost in the race
Prostituted your mind
Now you don't control yourself
What is left in you?
You can't find a trace
Call yourselves number one
Ha ha, we laugh in your faces
You're just another society
You require acceptance, too
Think you're individuals
But you really areEmbed
