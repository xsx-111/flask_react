Self-Defense LyricsGray haired ladies carry 45 autos
Defenseless against nothing that moves
Take courses in judo and karate
Youâ€™ll never catch them by surprise
Self defense, self defense - No longer safe to be a lawbreaker
Self defense, self defense - Armed citizens are waiting to react
Self defense, self defense - Dishonest living is a thing of the past
Get a job and forget about stealing

Self defense, self defense - No longer safe to be a lawbreaker
Self defense, self defense - Armed citizens are waiting to react
Self defense, self defense - Dishonest living is a thing of the past
Get a job and forget about stealingEmbed
