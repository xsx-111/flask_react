In The Black LyricsWhat are we doing here?
Why did we come at all?
Did we think we'd find the truth?
An answer to this mystery
All the signs say beware
But now I really don't care
I've come too far to go back
I'm gonna find out what's in the black
All the signs say beware
But now I really don't care
I've come too far to go back
I'm gonna find out what's in the black
Now I'm standing all alone
The rest have gone away
I'm about to find the answer
One more step, but do I dare?
All the signs say beware
But now I really don't care
I've come too far to go back
I'm gonna find out what's in the black
All the signs say beware
But now I really don't care
I've come too far to go back
I'm gonna find out what's in the black
I open up the door
I realize too late
I'm trapped, no way out
I hope I live to see tomorrow
All the signs said beware
But now I really didn't care
Went too far to go back
I found out what's in the black
All the signs said beware
But now I really didn't care
Went too far to go back
I've become part of the blackEmbed
