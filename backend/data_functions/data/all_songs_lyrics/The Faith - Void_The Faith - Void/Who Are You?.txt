Who Are You? Lyrics
I wake up and I see you everyday
Never hear a thing I say
I come to you with all my problems
You don't care, you won't be bothered

Who are you and why am I here?
Who are you and why am I here?
Who are you and why am I here?
Who are you and why am I here?

Bribe me if I use your car
Make me a fool, make me a liar
How can I ever grow?
Around people I don't know

Who are you and why am I here?
Who are you and why am I here?
Who are you and why am I here?
Who are you and why am I here?

Say you want to hear my problems
You're shocked when you find them out
I leave, no trust in you at all
Never know you might turn on me
Who are you and why am I here?
Who are you and why am I here?
Who are you and why am I here?
Who are you and why am I here?Embed
