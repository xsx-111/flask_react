What You Think LyricsSometimes I think too much
Sometimes, not enough
But either way I still got views
I live my life the way I choose
You don't understand me
You don't see where I stand
It doesn't matter what you think
My life's in my hands
Sometimes I think too much
Sometimes, not enough
But either way I still got views
I live my life the way I choose
You don't understand me
You don't see where I stand
It doesn't matter what you think
My life's in my handsEmbed
