Confusion LyricsBlinded by an image that wasn't there
Tricked by a game that wasn't fair
Deceived by people who didn't care
It's just mass confusion
Frustration and disillusion
Crying out in despair
Reaching out for what's not there
Panic, panic, scream and shout
Lose your mind, there's no way out
All you've got is all you need
Time to think, time to bleed
Blinded by an image that wasn't there
Tricked by a game that wasn't fair
Deceived by people who didn't care
It's just mass confusion
Frustration and disillusion
Crying out in despair
Reaching out for what's not there
Panic, panic, scream and shout
Lose your mind, there's no way out
All you've got is all you need
Time to think, time to bleedEmbed
