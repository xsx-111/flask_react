Get Up Off Our Knees Lyrics
Famines will be famines, banquets will be banquets
Some spend winter in a palace, some spend it in blankets
Don't wag your fingers at them and turn to walk away
Don't shoot someone tomorrow that you can shoot today, can shoot today
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

Time to end the praying
Listen what they're saying

(Get up off our knees)
You can wag your finger till your finger's sore
Shake your head till it shakes no more
(Get up off our knees)
You can wag your finger till your finger's sore
Shake your head till it shakes no more
(Get up off our knees)
Oh-ho, get up off our knees...

Paupers will be paupers, bankers will be bankers
Some own pennies in a jar, some own oil tankers
What may sound like tomorrow could be ours today
There's no more need for sorrow if we get off our knees to pray, off our knees to pray
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

Time to end the praying
Listen what they're saying

(Get up off our knees)
You can wag your finger till your finger's sore
Shake your head till it shakes no more
(Get up off our knees)
You can wag your finger till your finger's sore
Shake your head till it shakes no more
(Get up off our knees)
Oh-ho, get up off those knees
Get up off those knees...

Countries will be countries, borders will be borders
Some have lost their folks at war, some have given orders
Don't wag your fingers at them and turn to walk away
Don't shoot someone tomorrow that you can shoot today, can shoot today
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

Time to end the praying
Listen what they're saying

(Get up off our knees)
You can wag your finger till your finger's sore
Shake your head till it shakes no more
(Get up off our knees)
You can wag your finger till your finger's sore
Shake your head till it shakes no more
(Get up off our knees)
Oh-ho, get up off our knees...

Get up off our knees
Get up off our knees
Get up off our knees!Embed
