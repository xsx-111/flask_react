Anxious Lyrics
I was walking by the river, I was asking myself questions
But the answers I came up with didn't fit
Some have breakfast in bed, some aren't properly fed
The way they talk about it makes me want to spit

And they're raising all their eyebrows at the raising of the pound
While they raze another city to the ground
And they're opening the doors and crawling 'round on all fours
Looking for a sense in lost and found

Anxious (Don't they know it is wrong?)
I said I'm anxious (It makes me anxious)
Anxious (Don't they know it is wrong?)
I said I'm anxious, ho ho ho, ho-ho (It makes me anxious)

I really thought I'd have my tongue tied if I stood up to shout
But all they did was listen without their ears
And I thought I'd be beheaded if I stuck my neck out
But they just gave me a hanky for my tears

I have confidence in confidence, I hope that hope pulls through
But I think a little more is needed now
We've got to form a congregation and sink down the nation
Batter all the sinners to the ground
Anxious (Don't they know it is wrong?)
I said I'm anxious (It makes me anxious)
Anxious (Don't they know it is wrong?)
I said I'm anxious, ho ho ho, ho-ho (It makes me anxious)

I, I, I, I said I'm anxious (Don't they know it is wrong?)
I said I'm anxious (It makes me anxious)
I said I'm anxious (Don't they know it is wrong?)
I said I'm anxious (It makes me anxious)

I said, don't they know it is wrong?
It makes me anxious
Don't they know it is wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong...Embed
