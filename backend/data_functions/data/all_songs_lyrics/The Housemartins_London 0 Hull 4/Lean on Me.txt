Lean on Me Lyrics
Heavy burden on your shoulder, lean on me
Heavy burden on your shoulder, lean on me
Heavy burden on your shoulder, everyday just a little bit older
Heavy burden on your shoulder, lean on me

Down and out without hope, lean on me
Down and out without hope, lean on me
Down and out without hope; I'm right here, I'll help you cope
Down and out without hope, lean on me

Grab a rope and pull me in, but lean on me
Everyday, you'll have a friend, but lean on me, lean on me, lean on me
Grab a rope, pull me in, everyday you'll have a friend
Grab a rope, ooh...

When's the world's blocked away
And if you're looking for a rainy day, friend
Well, grab a rope, pull me in; lean on me

Heavy burden, cloudy skies; well, lean on me
Well, I'll be the towel for weeping eyes, but lean on me
If it always feels like rain, all you've got in life is pain
Heavy burden, go away, ooh...goodbye, goodbye
Heavy burden, on your shoulder, lean on me
Lean on me, lean on me brother
On your shoulder, lean on me...Embed
