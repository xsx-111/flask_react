Sheep Lyrics
Sometimes I get so angry with the simple life they lead
The shepherd's smile seems to confirm my fears
And they've never questioned anything, never disagreed
Sometimes I think they must have wool in their ears

And when you see a cane, I see a crock
And when you see a crowd, I see a flock
It's sheep we're up against (sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against)
It's sheep we're up against (sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against)

When I was young, they used to get me counting sheep
But the counting I did was all in vain
Now when I'm tired and I'm trying to get to sleep
I count humans jumping onto trains

And when you see a cane, I see a crock
And when you see a crowd, I see a flock
It's sheep we're up against (sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against)
It's sheep we're up against (sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against)
And when you see a cane, I see a crock
And when you see a crowd, I see a flock
It's sheep we're up against (sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against)
It's sheep we're up against (sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against, sheep we're up against)
Whoa, sheep we're up against
Whoa, woah, woah, woah, woah...Embed
