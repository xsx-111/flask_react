Flag Day Lyrics
Too many Florence Nightingales
Not enough Robin Hoods
Too many halos, not enough heroes
Coming up with the goods

So you thought you'd like to change the world
Decided to stage a jumble sale
For the poor, for the poor...

So you thought you'd like to change the world
Decided to stage a jumble sale
For the poor, for the poor...

(Flag day) It's a waste of time, if you know what they mean
(Flag day) Try shaking your box in front of the Queen
(Flag day) 'Cause her purse is fat and bursting at the seams
(Flag day) It's a waste of time, if you know what they mean

(Flag day) Oh-oh, oh-oh oh
(Flag day) Ah ha...
(Flag day) Oh oh, oh-oh oh
(Flag day) Mmm, ah...
Too many hands in too many pockets
Not enough hands on hearts
Too many ready to call it a day
Before the day starts

So you thought you'd like to see them healed
Got Blue Peter to stage an appeal
For the poor, for the poor...

So you thought you'd like to see them healed
Got Blue Peter to stage an appeal
For the poor, for the poor...

(Flag day) It's a waste of time, if you know what they mean
(Flag day) Try shaking your box in front of the Queen
(Flag day) 'Cause her purse is fat and bursting at the seams
(Flag day) It's a waste of time, if you know what they mean

Flag day
Flag day
Flag day
Flag day
Flag day
Flag day
Flag day
Flag day...
