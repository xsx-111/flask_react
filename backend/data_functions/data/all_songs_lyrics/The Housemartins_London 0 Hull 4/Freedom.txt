Freedom Lyrics
I used to think you understood
Taught me right and learned me good
Made things simple for my brain
Told the truth and made it plain

But the implications I mistook
Until I found out whose side you took
And now with paper in my hand
I'm beginning to understand

So this is freedom (they must be joking)
They must be joking (if they think it's true)
So this is freedom (I doubt their truth)
So this is freedom (for me and you)

From the front page news to the interviews
It's sink the reds and lift the blues
They pretend they're differing points of view
But it's only different shades of blue

But the implications I mistook
Until I found out whose side you took
And now with paper in my hand
I'm beginning to understand
So this is freedom (they must be joking)
They must be joking (if they think it's true)
So this is freedom (I doubt their truth)
So this is freedom (for me and you)


But the implications I mistook
Until I found out whose side you took
And now with paper in my hand
I'm beginning to understand

So this is freedom (they must be joking)
They must be joking (if they think it's true)
So this is freedom (I doubt their truth)
So this is freedom (for me and you)

F.R.E.E.D.O.M
They locked us up once, so they'll do it again
C.H.A.I.N.E.D
They locked up my friends, now they're coming for me...Embed
