Over There Lyrics
The fence is long and high where we love
You can't see the other side where they live
I've spied with my little eye
And I've sighed with my little sigh
But it seems I've given all that I can give

Every hour I have to count to ten
And a thousand times I've thought again
But it seems I've given all that I can give

Is anyone there
Here is the fence that they built (Over there)
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there (Over there)
Is anyone there
Here is the fence that they built (Over there)
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there (Over there)

This is the fence that turns one into two
I want to break through but I'm though if I do
I've tried with my little try
And I've cried with my little cry
But it seems that the gate holds the only clue
Every hour I have to count to ten
And a thousand times I've thought again
But it seems I've given all that I can give

Is anyone there
Here is the fence that they built (Over there)
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there (Over there)
Is anyone there
Here is the fence that they built (Over there)
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there (Over there)


Every hour I have to count to ten
And a thousand times I've thought again

Is anyone there
Here is the fence that they built (Over there)
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there (Over there)
Is anyone there
Here is the fence that they built (Over there)
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there (Over there)Embed
