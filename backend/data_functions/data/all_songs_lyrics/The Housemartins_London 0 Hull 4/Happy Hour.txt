Happy Hour Lyrics
It's happy hour again
I think I might be happy if I wasn't out with them
And they're happy, it's a lovely place to be
Happy that the fire's real, the barman is a she

Where the haircuts smile and the meaning of style
Is a night out with the boss
Where you win or you lose, and it's them who choose
And if you don't win, then you've lost

What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me (It's happy hour again)
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never been happy for me (It's happy hour again)
No, woah-oh

It's another night out with the boss
Following in footsteps overgrown with moss
And he tells me that women grow on trees
And if you catch them right, they will land upon their knees
Where they open all their wallets and they close all their minds
And they love to buy you all a drink
And then we ask all the questions, and you take all your clothes off
And go back to the kitchen sink

What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me (It's happy hour again)
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never been happy for me (It's happy hour again)
No, woah-oh, oh

What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never been happy for me (It's happy hour again)

Don't believe it, don't believe it (It's happy hour again)
Don't believe it (It's happy hour again)
And again, and again
(It's happy hour again) and again, and again
(It's happy hour again) and again, and again
It's happy hour again2Embed
