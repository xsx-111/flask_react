Kundalini Express Lyrics
This is an announcement
For the transcendental run
The train now standing
Leaves for higher planes
Due to a derailment
There will be no other train
So why not hop on this one?
Hear the porter's glad refrain
Each carriage is connected
As is every single train
The rails all form a track
Which is a link within a chain
The chain's connected
To another chain now
You will need no ticket
If you wish to ride on this train

Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo! Woot woo!
All aboard the express Kundalini
All aboard the express Kundalini
All aboard the express Kundalini
The song is in your heart
Your heart is in the song
The song is of the earth
The song is of the sky

You are disintegrating
Into everything around
Reintegrating
The worm we dug from higher ground
You have let go of ego
Ego is no longer you
Closer to nirvana
Since the porter's whistle blew

All aboard the express Kundalini
All aboard the express Kundalini
All aboard the express Kundalini
Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo!
Woot woo!....
