Holiday on the Moon LyricsYou can't get a suntan on the Moon
But I wouldn't mind a holiday there
They say you can't get a suntan on the Moon
But I wouldn't mind a holiday there
All expenses paid courtesy of NASA
Thank you, Mister President, for my holiday, sir
I couldn't really say that I wish you were here
But thank you all the same, sir
For my holiday
