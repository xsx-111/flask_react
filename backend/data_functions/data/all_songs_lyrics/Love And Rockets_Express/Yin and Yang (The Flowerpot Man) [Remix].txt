Yin and Yang (The Flowerpot Man)  Lyrics
Under the wheel of the running train
Like a dog in the pouring rain
Diamond days cut and dry
But beauty in the hurricane's eye

Under fire, under thumb
No golden hand, no golden sun
Diamond days cut and dry
But beauty in the hurricane's eye

Beauty beauty beauty beautiful
Beauty beauty beauty beautiful
Beauty beauty beauty beautiful
Beauty beauty beauty beautiful

Alcohol is your yoga, baby
Gonna call out my name
Then I'm gonna rain
All over you
All over you
Diamond days cut and dry
But beauty in the hurricanе's eye

Beauty bеauty beauty beautiful
Beauty beauty beauty beautiful
Beauty beauty beauty beautiful
Beauty beauty beauty beautifulEmbed
