An American Dream LyricsAnd I was dreaming in my sleep
Saw through you all
And I was dreaming, still on my feet
Saw through you all
And I saw what you could be
And you just don't feel free
And I saw what you could be
But you just won't be real to me
So let's blame this excess
On an American dream
So let's blame the success
Of an American dream
Are you confused by the chaos
In everyone's wandering eyes?
Do you dream of running naked
In warm rain?
Are you confused by the chaos?
It's no, it's no surprise
We all stand next to Jesus
'Cause to Satan, we're both the same
These birds can't fly away, away
These birds can't fly away, away
So let's blame this excess
On an American dream, dream
So let's blame the success
Of an American dream
Of an American dream
Of an American dream
Of an American dream
Ohhh

Feeling so high and low
It's the American dream
It's the American dream
It's the American dream
It's the American dream
It's the American dream
America
America
America
America
