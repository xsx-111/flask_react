All In My Mind Lyrics
Walk around so cold, so cold, so lonely
Or lay in bed wondering what to do with time
You've got no sense of fun until you know you've won again
And yet you feel so much, you feel so much inside
You want to rip all the jewels off all the idiots' backs so badly
You scream, "Give me what I've always missed, give me a good time"
But if you look into your mirror, you'll see that nobody
Has ever ripped you off, it's all in your mind

Her beauty can only ever be skin deep
But if I'm honest, that's all I ever really need
So throw us some flowers, and we'll give you some songs and sunshine
And if you give me an hour, I'll show you how you feel

Ohh, baby
Ohh, I'm much too lazy
Ohh
It's all in my mind
So don't be unkind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
Sometimes you really don't, really don't, really don't know what I mean
Sometimes you really don't, really don't, really don't know what I need

I say I've got no sense of fun until I know I've won again
And how do you think, yes, how do you think that feels?
So, just give me an hour, I'll show you how you feel

Ohh, baby
Ohh, I'm much too lazy
Ohh, baby
Ohh
It's all in my mind
So don't be unkind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mindEmbed
