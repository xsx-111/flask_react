All In My Mind (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
Walk around so cold, so cold, so lonely
Or lay in bed wondering what to do with time
You've got no sense of fun until you know you've won again
And yet you feel so much, you feel so much inside
Ohhh, ohhh

Her beauty can only ever be skin deep
But if I'm honest, that's all I ever really need
So throw us some flowers, we'll give you some songs and sunshine
And if you give me an hour, I'll show you how you feel

Ohh, baby
Ohh, I'm much too lazy
Ohh, baby
Ohh

You want to rip all the jewels off all the idiots' backs so badly
You scream, "Give me what I've always missed, give me a good time"
But if you look into your mirror, you'll see that nobody
Has ever ripped you off, it's all in your mind
Ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh
Ohh, baby
Ohh, I'm much too lazy
Ohh, baby
OhhEmbed
