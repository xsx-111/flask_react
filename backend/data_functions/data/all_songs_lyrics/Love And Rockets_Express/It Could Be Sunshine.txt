It Could Be Sunshine LyricsYou can get from here to there
By leaps and bounds or measured steps
You can make it dark or fair
Depending on your point of view
You can get a taste of the glory
By the ingestion of a simple truth
You can take a look around
See the outside, see the inside too
Are you on a road to nowhere?
Are you riding a train to Heaven or Hell?
Are you in search of somewhere
Or something that rings true?
Well, it could be closer than you think
It could be closer than you think
It could be closer than you think
It could be closer than you think it is
Give me your sunshine again
You've left me in a mess
And when I fall, I really fall
And that's when you go to my head, my head
It could be sunshine
It could be sunshine
It could be sunshine
It could be sunshine
Give me songs and freedom
Give me love in every sense
Raise me up so high with you
All the cavemen fade away, away
It could be sunshine
It could be sunshine
It could be sunshine
It could be sunshine
Walking on the sidewalk of life
Will only make you grey and sad
Lift me up so high, so high
My life's always in your hands, your hands
It could be sunshine
It could be sunshine
It could be sunshine
It could be sunshine
My love for you won't last for one day
My love for you will last for two
My love for you won't last for one day
My love for you will last for two
My love for you won't last for one day
My love for you will last for two
My love for you won't last for one dayEmbed
