Girl with No Eyes Lyrics
There's a girl in my room and her face on the wall with no eyes
There's a girl in my room and her face on the wall with no eyes

Girl with no eyes, who can she be?
The girl with no eyes, she's looking at me
There's a girl in my room
And her face on the wall with no eyes

If I make a sound she'll know that I'm stirring inside
If I make a sound she'll know that I'm trying to hide

Girl with no eyes, who can she be?
The girl with no eyes, she's looking at me
Beautiful girl, who does she see?
Beautiful girl, she seems to be staring

Doesn't everybody know (Everybody know)
Everybody know love takes a lifetime?
And doesn't everybody know (Everybody know)
Everybody know love is the high side?
It's the high side of a lifetime

She's just a reflection of all of the time that's gone by
She's just a reflection of all of the time I've been high

Girl with no eyes, who can she be?
Girl with no eyes, she's looking at me
Beautiful girl, who does she see?
Beautiful girl, she seems to be staring

Doesn't everybody know (Everybody know)
Everybody know love takes a lifetime?
And doesn't everybody know (Everybody know)
Everybody know love is the high side?
It's the high side of a lifetimeEmbed
