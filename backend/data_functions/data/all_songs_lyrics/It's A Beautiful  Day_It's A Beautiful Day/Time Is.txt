Time Is Lyrics
Time is too slow for those who wait
And time is too swift for those who fear
Time is too long for those who grieve
And time is too short for those that laugh

And love is too slow for those who wait
And love is too swift for those who fear
Love is too long for those who grieve
And love is too short for those that laugh

But for those who love
But for those who really love
But for those who love
Time
Sweet time
Precious time
Lovely time
All the time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time is eternity (Is eternity)


Hours fly
Hours fly
Hours fly
But even flowers must die

And then a new day comes
And there's a new day's dawn
And there's a new day's sun
And love stays on

Sweet love stays on
Love stays on
Love stays on
Love stays on
Love stays on
Love stays on
Love, love, love, love
And time (Time), time (time), time (time), time (time)

Time is too slow for those who wait
And time is too swift for those who fear
Time is too long for those who grieve
And time is too short for those that laugh
And love is too slow for those who wait
And love is too swift for those who fear
Love is too long for those who grieve
And love is too short for those that laugh

But for those who love (But for those who love)
But for those who really love (Yes, for those who really love)
Yes, for those who love (But for those who love)
Sweet time (Sweet time)
Sweet time (Sweet love)
Precious time (Precious time)
Precious love (Precious love)
Sweet love (Sweet time)
Time (Time)
Time (Time)
Time (Time)
Time (Love)
Love (Time)
Time (Love)
Love (Time)
Time (Love)
Love (Time)
Time (Love)
Love (Time)
Time (Love)
Time (Time)
Time (Time is eternity)
Time is eternityEmbed
