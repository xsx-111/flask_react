Wasted Union Blues Lyrics
Eno, ruof, eerht, owt, eno
So tired
And wasted

So tired I don't know if I can make it
So wasted I don't know if I can take it
So tired I don't know if I can make it
No (Oh no)

So tired I don't know if I can take it
So wasted I don't know if I can fake it
So tired I don't know if I can make it
No, but I'm gonna try, you better believe


Spirits all tell me, gotta keep drivin' on
And my brothers all tell me I can do no wrong
But the universe tells me I can't leave myself alone
Alone, alone

I'm so tired I don't know if I can take it
So wasted, oh Lord, don't know if I can fake it
So tired I don't know if I can take it
No, oh no, let's go
I say come on, baby, let's try to make it
I know that if we really try we can take itEmbed
