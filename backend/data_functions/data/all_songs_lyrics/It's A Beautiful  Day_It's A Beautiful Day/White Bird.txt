White Bird Lyrics
White bird in a golden cage
On a winter's day, in the rain
White bird in a golden cage
Alone

The leaves blow 'cross the long, black road
To the darkened sky in its rage
But the white bird just sits in her cage
Unknown

White bird must fly, she will die


The white bird dreams of the aspen tree
With her dying leaves turning gold
But the white bird just sits in her cage
Growing old

White bird must fly or she will die
White bird must fly or she will die
The sunsets come, the sunsets go
The clouds roll by, and the Earth turns slow
And a young bird's eyes do always glow
And she must fly
She must fly
She must fly


White bird in a golden cage
On a winter's day, in the rain
White bird in a golden cage
Alone

White bird must fly, she will die
White bird must fly or she will die
White bird must fly, she will die

White bird must fly3Embed
