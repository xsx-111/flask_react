Hot Summer Day Lyrics
Hot summer day (Hot summer day)
Carry me along
Oh, hot summer day (Hot summer day)
Please carry me along
Hot summer day
Carry me along
To its end
Where I begin

Long summer dream (Long summer dream)
Slidin' 'round my mind
Those long summer dreams (Long summer dream)
Are leavin' me behind
Hot summer day
Carry me along
To its end
Where I begin

Circlin' like a river
Over brightly colored stones
Breakin' up my soul
And takin' part of me home
Leavin' the other half
To tumble all alone
Love, love, where did you go?

Hot summer day (Hot summer day)
Carry me along
To its end
Where I begin
Those long summer dreams (Long summer dream)
Still spinnin' 'round my mind
And they end
Where they begin

And I want to grab that river
And stop the love that's dyin'
Because I know that somewhere
Deep inside my soul you're still lyin'
Waitin' to awaken
And shake that river's flow
Love, love, where did you go?

They told me that the sun turned green
I said I didn't know
And they told me that the moon turned blue
I said it didn't show
And they told me that I looked a fool
And I said I'd let that go
But when they told me that our love was dead
I had to turn and go
Oh love
Love
Love
Love
Love
Where did you go?

Hot summer day (Hot summer day)
Carry me along
To its end
Where I begin
Long summer dreams (Long summer dream)
Slidin' 'round my mind
And they end
Where they begin

Circlin' like a river
Over brightly colored stones
Breakin' up my soul
And takin' part of me home
Leavin' the other half
To tumble all alone
Love, love, where did you go?Embed
