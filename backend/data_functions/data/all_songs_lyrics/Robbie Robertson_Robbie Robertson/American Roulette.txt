American Roulette LyricsHe was born in the belly of the country
Over east of Eden, yeah
Confused by the big city blues
He didn't know whose life he's leading, no
Put yourself behind the wheel
And see if you can get that feel
Move faster by night
Move faster by night
The windows were all shattered
And the body was all battered
American Roulette
Stake your life upon it
American Roulette
Same eyes, same eyes
American Roulette
Take that boy and put him in a mansion
Paint the windows black
Give him all the women that he wants
Put a monkey on his back
All of your so called friends
Take you where the sidewalk ends
I said, can't sleep at night, no
Can't sleep at night
Lord please save his soul
He was the king of Rock and Roll
American Roulette
Stake your life upon it
American Roulette
Same eyes, same eyes
American Roulette
They said she didn't have a chance in hell
For the American Dream
There's a thousand young blondes out there
Trying to make it to the silver screen
But she had the walk, the look, the talk
That shook the world (Read about it)
Some like it hot, boy
Some like it cool
Too much for her to handle
Another scandal, she burnt the candle
American Roulette
Stake your life upon it
American Roulette
Same eyes, same eyes
American Roulette
Say a prayer for the lost generation
Who spin the wheel out of desperation
American Roulette
Stake your life upon it
American Roulette
Same eyes, same eyes
American Roulette
American Roulette
Stake your life upon it
