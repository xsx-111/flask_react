Showdown at Big Sky LyricsSoldier of fortune
He's a man of war
Just can't remember
What he's fighting for
Start a revolution
Right before your eyes
When you hear the big bang
Don't you be surprised
Showdown at big sky
Darkness at high noon
Showdown at big sky
That day may be soon
And people, people
Can you hear the sound
From every village and every town
Let the bells ring out (ring those bells)
Hear the bells ring in
Let the bells ring out (everybody)
Keep them ringing, ringing
Can't predict the future
Can't forget the past
Feels like any moment
Could be the last
All you believers
Standing inside this room
Can't you see it coming
Shooting out across the moon
Save this place
- In the valley of tears
- By the river of time
From weapons race
- In the Book of David
- In the holy night
When it's laid to waste
- It will be written
- By the children of Eden
I said save this place
- And the Holy Ghost
Showdown at big sky
Darkness at high noon
Showdown at big sky
That day may be soon
And people, people
Can you hear the sound
From every village and every town
Let the bells ring out (ring those bells)
Hear the bells ring in (ring those bells)
Let the bells ring out (everybody)
Keep them ringing, ringing
Save this place
- In the valley of tears
- By the river of time
From the weapons race
- In the Book of David
- In the holy night
When it's laid to waste
- It will be written
- By the children of Eden
I said save this place
- And the Holy Ghost
- And the Holy Ghost
Showdown at big sky
Darkness at high noon
Kiss tomorrow goodbye
And that day could be soon
Give us the strength
Give us the wisdom
And give us tomorrow
Let the bells ring out (ring those bells)
Hear the bells ring in
Let the bells ring out (oh those people)
Keep them ringing, ringing (ring those bells)
Let the bells ring out (ring out)
Hear the bells ring in (ring in)
Let the bells ring out (oh those people)
Keep them ringing, ringing (ring those bells)
Let the bells ring out
Hear the bells ring in
Let the bells ring out
Keep them ringing, ringingEmbed
