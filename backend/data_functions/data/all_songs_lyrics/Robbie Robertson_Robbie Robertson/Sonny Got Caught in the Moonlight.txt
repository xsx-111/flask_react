Sonny Got Caught in the Moonlight LyricsSonny got caught in the moonlight
A wanted man with a haunted heart (I said...)
Sonny found out the hard way
Playing for keeps, loser weeps
He said he'd come back when the lion sleeps
Struck by lightning, the fire is dying
And she called out your name
Sudden thunder, the sky is crying
Can't tell the tears from the rain
Sonny got caught in the moonlight
Paint graffiti on the subway wall
Sonny got lost in the blue night
They stood like statues, legs spread wide
Catch him in the crossfire and take him by surprise
Struck by lightning, the fire is dying
And she called out your name
Sudden thunder, the sky is crying
Can't tell the tears from the rain
Can't tell the tears from the rain
All my life I've been running
Paint a portrait of a fool
And with my heart in my hands
Oh, they've come to take me down
Sonny got caught in the moonlight
By the power that can turn the tide
And I heard three shots around midnight
Driven by the passion, running from the heat
No questions asked...he's just a kid from the street
Struck by lightning, the fire is dying
And she called out your name
Sudden thunder, the sky is crying
Can't tell the tears from the rain
Can't tell the tears from the rainEmbed
