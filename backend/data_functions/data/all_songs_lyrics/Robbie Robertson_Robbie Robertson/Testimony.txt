Testimony LyricsLook over yonder, Apollo at a distance
You can hear his music if you listen to the wind blow
I wanna be there, I wanna be right there
I wanna see it with my own eyes
Bear witness, I'm wailing like the wind
Come bear witness, the half-breed rides again
In these hands, I've held the broken dream
In my soul, I'm howling at the moon
Testimony, testimony
Declare yourself, I will testify
Testimony, testimony
Speak the truth, I will testify
I had a revelation like runaway horses
Took to the road with a carnival show (roll on)
Those golden days on Smokey Mountain
Lord, playing guitar in a one man band, that's right
Bear witness, I'm howling at the moon
Come bear witness, I've danced among the ruins
In these shoes, I've walked a crooked mile
All my life I been searching for the night bird
Testimony, testimony
Declare yourself, I will testify
Testimony, testimony
Speak the truth, I will testify
Are you ready to take the heat
Are you ready to blow the steam
Are you ready to bag the street
You got nothing to lose - but your chains
For forty days and forty nights
I come across the desert
Apollo right by my side (rave on)
Bear witness, I'm wailing like the wind
Come bear witness, the half-breed rides again
In these hands, I've held the broken dream
In my soul, I'm howling at the moon
Testimony, testimony
Declare yourself, I will testify
Testimony, testimony
Speak the truth, I will testify
Testimony, testimony
Testimony, I will testify
Testimony, testimony
Speak the truth, I will testify
Testimony, testimony
Declare yourself, I will testify
Testimony, testimony
Speak the truth, I will testifyEmbed
