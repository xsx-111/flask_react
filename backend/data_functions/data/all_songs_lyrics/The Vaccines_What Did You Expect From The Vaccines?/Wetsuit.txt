Wetsuit Lyrics
If at some point we all succumb
For goodness sake let us be young
'Cause time gets harder to outrun
And I'm nobody, I'm not done
With a cool cool breeze and dirty knees
I rest on childhood memories
We all got old at breakneck speed
Slow it down, go easy on me
Go easy on me

Put a wetsuit on, come on, come on
Grow your hair out long, come on, come on
Put a t-shirt on
Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong

If it's up and after you
What do you suppose that you would do?
You're all whacked out from lack of sleep
You blame it on the friends you keep
Well, you want to do things differently
Go do them independently
We all got old at breakneck speed
Slow it down, go easy on me
Go easy on me
Put a wetsuit on, come on, come on
Grow your hair out long, come on, come on
Put a t-shirt on
Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong

Put a wetsuit on, come on, come on
Grow your hair out long, come on, come on
Put a t-shirt on
Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong

Does holy water make you pure?
Submerged your vision's just obscured
You're a lot like me
In up to our knees
In over your chest is way too deep

So put a wetsuit on, come on, come on
Grow your hair out long, come on, come on
Put a t-shirt on
Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong

Put a wetsuit on, come on, come on
Grow your hair out long, come on, come on
Put a t-shirt on
Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong5Embed
