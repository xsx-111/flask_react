Blow It Up Lyrics
Okay, I could live without it
Were you ever my age? No, I doubt it
A Native American feather
Degenerates look better in leather

Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up!

Trippin' out is fun on the weekend
But you don't feel as young with a girlfriend
I'm bored of trying to deal with your ego
Play it like that and it will though

Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow it up! Blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up!2Embed
