Triple Spiral LyricsI loved a triple spiral, my maiden-mother-crone
I folded my devotion into an origami rose
Stood at her Tiffany window
She said to look below
Could I see the town was burning?
Could I see the broken prison?
Could I see that it was time for me to go?
They looted the museum, took all that they could hold
A motorcade of flatbed trucks made off with quite a haul
That's when I heard someone shout
"In with the new, out with the old"
A dusty box of letters
A rusty suit of armor
A casket made of 14 karat gold
That's the problem, no sense of time
She's shaped just like an hour glass
There laying on her side
I loved you triple spiral, Father, son, and ghost
But you left me in my darkest hour
When I needed you, when I needed you
And now the dream is over, I want it to be known
I never saw it coming
From my little human prism
How sad it is to know I'm in control
That's the problem, an empty sky
I fill it up with everything that's missing from my life
Where'd you come from, you fated sign?
Spinning through the centuries, expanding all the time
Three worlds at one that blend together
Three times I cried for us but I felt better then
I loved you triple spiral, my maiden-mother-crone
You found me in this fallow state, my mind was off and stoned
I heard your strange commotion
And wished I could go home
To live a little longer
A full Indian summer
Long enough to carve you into stone3Embed
