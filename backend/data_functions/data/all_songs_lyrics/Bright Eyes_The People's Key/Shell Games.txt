Shell Games LyricsTook the fireworks and the vanity
The circuit board and the city streets
Shooting star, swaying palm tree
Laid it at the arbiter's feet
If I could change my mind, change the paradigm
Prepare myself for another life
Forgive myself for the many times
I was cruel to something helpless and weak
But here it comes, that heavy love
I'm never going to move it alone
Here it comes, that heavy love
Tag it on a tenement wall
Here it comes, that heavy love
Someone's got to share in the load
Here it comes, that heavy love
I'm never going to move it alone
I was dressed in white, touched by something pure
Death obsessed like a teenager
Sold my tortured youth, piss and vinegar
I'm still angry with no reason to be
At the architect who imagined this
For the everyman, blessed Sisyphus
Slipping steadily into madness
Now that's the only place to be free
But here it comes, that heavy love
You're never going to move it alone
Here it comes, that heavy love
Tattooed on a criminal's arm
Here it comes, that heavy love
Someone got to share in the load
Here it comes, that heavy love
You're never going to move it alone
No, I don't want to play
It's a shell game, it's a shell game
Distorted sounds on oscilloscopes
Distorted facts, I could never cope
My private life is an inside joke
No one will explain it to me
We'll be everything that we ever needed
Everyone, on the count of three!
Everyone, on the count of three!
All together now!
Here it comes, that heavy love
We're never going to move it alone
Here it comes, that heavy love
Playing as the cylinder rolls
Here it comes, that heavy love
I only want to share in the load
Here it comes, that heavy love
I'm never going to move it alone2Embed
