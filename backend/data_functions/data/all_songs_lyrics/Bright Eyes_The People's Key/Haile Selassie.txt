Haile Selassie Lyrics
Pilgrim across the water
We are the same, brother
Hitchhiking back to Zion
Holding our tears as we flip the album
What if this leads to ruin?
You got a soul, use it
All this despair, forgiven
Rolling away on the Wheel of Sevens
Sings like the Queen of Sheba
Voice through a blonde speaker
One dropping bubble and Leslie
Calling me home like Haile Selassie

Pilgrim beside the fire
It's been a long winter
We've got a lot in common
Cover our heads as they split the atom
All of our days are numbered
I'm taking some comfort
In knowing the wave has crested
Knowing I don't have to be an exception
Children that fill the bleachers
One is the next Caesar
Keep all their minds collected
Until he comes, until he comes

How do you make a day in plain sight?
Too good to be true

I seen, I seen, I seen stranger things, man
I seen, I seen that tree of smoke
Yeah, I seen, I seen, I seen
I seen stranger things happen
Happen before

Pilgrim up on the mountain
Barefoot and still climbin'
Filling the book of hours
Day after day in the filth and squalor
We are the chosen people
Safe from the next evil
One love! Magnetic memory
Reel after reel spinning within me
I had the wildest dream last night
I was swimming with you
In that cenote the Heavens made with black fire
Just woke up too soon

I seen, I seen, I seen stranger things, man
I seen, I seen those daytime ghosts
Yeah, I seen, I seen, I seen
I seen stranger things happen
Happen before

I seen, I seen, I seen the strangest things, man
I seen, I seen that tree of smoke
Yeah, I seen, I seen
I seen stranger things happen
Happen before3Embed
