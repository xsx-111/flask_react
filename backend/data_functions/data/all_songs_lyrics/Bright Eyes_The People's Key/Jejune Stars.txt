Jejune Stars LyricsEvery new day is a gift, it's a song of redemption
Any expression of love is the way to return
To that place that I think of so often, but now never mention
The one the voice in the back of my head says that I don't deserve
Come fire, come water, come karma, we're all in transition
The wheel of becoming erases the physical mind
Until all that remains is a staircase of misinformation
And the code we inherit, the basis, the essence of life
So I go, umbrella under my arm into the green of the radar
How'd it get so dark in the day?
It's just so bizarre, is it true what we're made of?
Why do I hide from the rain?
Inside's so cloudy, nostalgia but there are no features
Look at ourselves through a porthole, the passage of time
See that sunny day that we snuck out, hid under the bleachers
Kissed as the band marched, everything fell into line
So I go, umbrella under my arm into the green of the radar
How'd I get so lost? I'm amazed
It's just so bizarre, all the things I'm afraid of
Why do I hide from the rain?
Sure I have my doubts but I know it now
We are Jejune stars
So it starts again at our childhood's end
I'll die young at heart
So I go, umbrella under my arm into the green of the radar
How'd it get so dark in the day?
It's just so bizarre if it's true what we're made of
Why do I hide from the rain?1Embed
