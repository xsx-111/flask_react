Approximate Sunlight LyricsUsed to dream of time machines
Now it's been said we're post-everything
As a child, imagining
Neckties and coastlines
I've seen the show, man, what a sight
Drenched us in approximated sunlight
The crowd was small and mostly blind
But kind, you're too kind
Now you are how you were
When you were real
Now you are how you were
When you were real
There you go again on that circular trip
Lick the solar plexus of some L.A. shaman
I'm out of breath, I better sit
Been living hard, living
All I do is follow
Just follow this hollow you around
I wouldn't waste another thought
On what is fair and what is not
The Quince√±era dress she bought
Was unstitched with bullets
All the guests in the garden screamed
Women and tires squealing
Such opulence, such misery
Unwinding, unwinding
All I do is follow
Just follow this hollow you around
Now you are how you were
When you were real2Embed
