Ladder Song LyricsNo one knows where the ladder goes
You're going to lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying
I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I want to fly in your silver ship
Let Jesus hang and Buddha sit
It's on now, the days are long now
The ups and the sundowns and a twisting mind
If I got to go first, I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors always changing sides
They were friends of mine
Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagined freedom
All the rest is predictable
You can say you're the first to know
Bought a mantra to concentrate
Car alarm or hissing snake
I know now how it's going to turn out
I've got to calm down or I'll lose my place
Got to get to the center, got to get to the concert
Run off with a dancer, going to celebrate
We'll welcome the new age, covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky
See now a star's born, looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you want to cry?
Precious friend of mine
Will I know when it's finally done?
This whole life is a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be3Embed
