Dark Horse Lyrics
You thought that you knew where I was and when
Baby it looks like he fooling you again
You thought that you had got me all staked out
Baby it looks like I've been breaking out

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped out of the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Just looking for the source
I'm a dark horse

You thought that you had got me in your grip
Baby looks like you was not so smart
And I became too slippery for you
But let me tell ya that was nothing new

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I picked up my first spoon
I've been a cool jerk
Just looking for the source
I'm a dark horse
I thought that you knew it all along
Until you started getting me not right
Seems as if you heard a little late
I warned you when we both was at the starting gate

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped out of the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Who's looking for his perks
I'm a dark horse
I'm a dark horse
I'm running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped right out of the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Just looking at the source
I'm a dark horse1Embed
