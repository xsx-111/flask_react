Bye Bye, Love Lyrics
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I know I'm gonna die
Goodbye my love bye bye

There goes our lady with a "you know who"
I hope she's happy and "old 'Clapper' too
We had good rhythm (and a little slide)
Then she stepped in
Did me a favour, I threw them both out

Goodbye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye my love bye bye
Bye bye love
It's gonna be a raining out of doors
Hello happiness
Goodbye my love goodbye
Now I'm into romance
I shy away from love
Got tired of ladies that plot and shove me
And that's the reason
We all can see so clearly
They see that our lady is out on a spree

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna, think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello emptiness
I think I'm gonna cry
Goodbye my love, goodbye
Goodbye my lovers, goodbye
Goodbye my loveEmbed
