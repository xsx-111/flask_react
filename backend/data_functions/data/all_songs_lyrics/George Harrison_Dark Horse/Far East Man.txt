Far East Man Lyrics
While the world wages war
It gets harder to see
Who your friends really are

I won't let him down
Got to do what I can
I can't let him drown
He's a far east man

All these ups and those downs
Makes me question what love is
Is it a lie or worthwhile

I can't let him down
Got to do what I can
I can't let him drown
He's a far east man

Sometimes is so short but it takes so long
Wondering if it is or if I'm wrong
Even then my heart seems to be the one in charge
Can only do what it tells me

We can't let them down
We got to do what we can
We can't let them drown
He's a far east man

Looks like right here on earth
God, it's hellish at times
I feel that a heaven's in sight

I can't let him down
Gonna do what I can
I can't let him drown
He's a far east manEmbed
