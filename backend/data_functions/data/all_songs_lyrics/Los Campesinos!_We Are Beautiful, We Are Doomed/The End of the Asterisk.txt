The End of the Asterisk Lyrics
On considering religion
Or military conscription
Is the moment I realise I am stuck
Asserting ourselves at traffic lights
In foreign countries in the very dead of night
Is the moment I realise I am stuck

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
This is the end of the asterisk
Babe, that punk's got nothing on me
This is the end of the footnote

Extorting money from your parents
Your disgusting parents

Honestly, you're an absolute waste of time
Craving attention with your self-deprecation
I'll tell you one thing
It's spot on and I'm better

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
This is the end of the asterisk
Babe, that punk's got nothing on me
This is the end of the footnote
Extorting money from your parents
Your disgusting parents

Honestly, you are an absolute tragedy
Not like 'heroically' in all of the books you read
I read your novella, oh, how I laughed
Killed off the lot of themEmbed
