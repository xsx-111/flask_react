Ways to Make It Through the Wall Lyrics
I think it's fair to say that I chose hopelessness
And inflicted it on the rest of us
But at least I've come to terms with my own mortality
We search for different ways
To make it through the wall
Resign our parents' interests
Will one day be our own

Oh, we wait at ease, oh, we wait to see
Oh, we are waiting here for catastrophe
Oh, we wait at ease, oh, we wait to see
Oh, we are waiting here for catastrophe

The guy singing all the sad songs died
Oh well, I guess he was right
Oh, I guess he was right
We learn together over time
That tolerance is more appealing
In theory than in practice
I identify my star sign
By asking which is least compatible with yours

Oh, we wait at ease, oh, we wait to see
Oh, we are waiting here for catastrophe
Oh, we wait at ease, oh, we wait to see
Oh, we are waiting here for catastrophe
And a room full of vacuum
And a room full of air look the same
You have not been reborn
They've just painted your face, painted the walls

Message sent to so far unreached peoples
I think they've got it in for us
I think they've got it in for us
How you break the rules that you yourself imposed
Think you've got it in for us
I think you've got it in for yourselves

Oh, we wait at ease, oh, we wait to see
Oh, we are waiting here for catastrophe
Oh, we wait at ease, oh, we wait to see
Oh, we are waiting here for catastrophe

And a room full of vacuum
And a room full of air look the same
You have not been reborn
They've just painted your face, painted the walls
Painted your face
Painted the walls
Painted your face
Painted the walls
Painted your face1Embed
