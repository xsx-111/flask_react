Miserabilia Lyrics
Go
Breathe
Easy

Your hands will remain empty
When you have stopped clutching at straws
Cling to bad memories, forget all the insufferable bores
No-one matters (No-one matters)
No-one cares

He whispered, "Oh my God, this really is a joy to behold"
Thought he said, "It's a joy to be held," so I held him too close
It was a grave mistake
He never came back again

I'm not saying there's good in none of this
Miserabilia to show the kids
I'm not saying that you're responsible
Miserabilia, for one, for all

I've spent too much time on my knees
Next to urinals in garish Mexican restaurants
Sobbing into my worn, pale palms
For a better understanding of my dietary requirements
I've cried on ashen floors of working men's clubs
'96, '98, 2000, 2002, 2004
Oh my God, will it end?
Oh my God, oh my God
We got nostalgic, ended up filling shoe boxes with vomit
Collected scabs in lockets
Hung them 'round our necks like nooses
None of it mattered (None of it matters)
Nobody cared

I'm not saying there's good in none of this
Miserabilia to show the kids
I'm not saying that you're responsible
Miserabilia, for one, for all

I have broken down into the naked breasts of a newly ex
No dignity, I can only guess
That she thinks about it when she touches herself
Shout at the world, because the world doesn't love you
Lower yourself, because you know that you'll have to1Embed
