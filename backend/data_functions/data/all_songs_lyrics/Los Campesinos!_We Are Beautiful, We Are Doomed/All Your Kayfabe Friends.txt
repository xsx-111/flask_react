All Your Kayfabe Friends Lyrics
Word is you slept in a weird position
And your back and your shoulders are aching
I say my stomach is chewing its way out from the inside
'Cause I've gone three days now without eating
I died on a cross-trainer, getting in shape for you
I fell at the first hurdle, you tell me I always do
You asked if I'd be anyone from history
Fact or fiction, dead or alive
I said, "I'd be Tony Cascarino, circa 1995"

We're feeling so much more content
Knowing where our allegiances lie
Since our kayfabe friends have upped and left, you and I

The time we spent around each others' waists
The time spent expressing my distaste
With my eyes on a lightbulb
I choose to keep your birthday present for myself
Blow candles, your ill health
I'm being paid thirty-five pounds an hour
As a specialist foot fetish model
Flatter my arches, I pirouette for them
I pick the angles, hide my ingrown toenail
You think you're the needle that drains the blood donation
You're just a repetition on an old, worn-out pin cushion
We're feeling so much more content
Knowing where our allegiances lie
Since our kayfabe friends have upped and left, you and I

As the bus pulls away, I stare at the last field
Before we hit the city, that emotional minefield
I seduced your ex-boyfriend to help you get over him
You found him more attractive, it helped you get over me

We're feeling so much more content
Knowing where our allegiances lie
Since our kayfabe friends have upped and left, you and I

In the shower, I chew the soap bar
From the plastic, the morning after
I love the look of empathy in your eyes
I love the look of lust between your thighs1Embed
