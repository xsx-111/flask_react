We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed Lyrics
By the light of the LED display of a VCR recorder
You kiss my neck, I whisper in your ear, "This is my downfall"
As you squint and you grimace
We both know your heart's not in it
By the glow of a thousand fireflies in a Travelodge ensuite
They think the future's bright as halogen
We know it's pretty bleak
And I am trying to be sexy
Biting at the air that falls in front of me

Your telegrams are more and more less detailed by the day
And all the characters are strangers
And the pubs have different names
I tell a joke I'd like to meet them
But they loathe me and I hate them back
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Fondness makes the absence longer
Length loses my interest, I'm a realist, I'm insatiable
Swapped counting days until I fly with hours before your reply

You said he got his teeth fixed
I'm gonna break them
I've got a heart on fire
He said he's got his sights set
On getting to ya
I've got a fist on fire
You feel terrified at the thought of being left behind
Of losing everybody, the necessity of dying
Oh, we kid ourselves there's future in the fucking
But there is no fucking future
I'm just practicing my accents, picking at old sutures

I taught myself the only way to vaguely get along in love
Is to like the other slightly less than you get in return
I keep feeling like I'm being undercut
Charlotte says, "It's more constructive than the one in Canada
When you got drunk, ate loads of crisps
And threw up by a football pitch"
I know it is, and really, that's what worries me
I feel like I should hurt

You said he got his teeth fixed
I'm gonna break them
I've got a heart on fire
He said he's got his sights set
On getting to ya
I've got a fist on fire

I cannot emphasise enough that my body
Is a badly designed, poorly put-together vessel
Harbouring these diminishing, so-called 'vital organs'
I hope my heart goes first
I hope my heart goes first!
We are beautiful
We are doomed2Embed
