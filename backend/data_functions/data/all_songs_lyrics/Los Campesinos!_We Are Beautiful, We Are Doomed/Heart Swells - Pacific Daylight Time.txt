Heart Swells / Pacific Daylight Time Lyrics
Black holes, unraised moles
Let's just call them freckles
Hair cut, part left
Happy on the West Coast
Coat fell, heart swells
Draped across the sofa
Sleep well, I feel
You've ruined me forever

I don't want to sound trite but you are perfect
The way you look could seriously make nature dysmorphic
I wish that you would kiss me 'til the point of paralysis
The way I flail my arms in front of you, it just embarrasses
I'll never turn my body clock back
And think about the things I'm glad I left out
Some things are best left unsaidEmbed
