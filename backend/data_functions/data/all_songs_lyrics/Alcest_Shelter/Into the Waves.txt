Into the Waves LyricsWe want to see
We want to see
Just let us see
We want to see
We never get old
Because we ran
Right into the sea
And tumbled around in the waves
To die with the earth all around
We want to see
We want to see
The sea treated us kind
Poured into our open mouths
And we knew this was the point when we
Would meet for real
The day we die
To see with our new eyes
The day we die
To see with our new eyes
Just let us see
We want to see
Our flesh dissolved
All along with the flow
We held hands through it all
The day we sought the flow
The day we lay down to sleep
To see with our new eyes
The day our bones decayed
To makes us feel more alive
The day we lay down to sleep
To see with our new eyes
To see with our new eyes
The day we lay down to sleep
To see with our new eyes
The day our bones decayed
To makes us feel more alive
The day we lay down to sleep
To make us feel more alive
To make us feel more aliveEmbed
