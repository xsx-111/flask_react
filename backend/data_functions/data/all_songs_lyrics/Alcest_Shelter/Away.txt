Away LyricsLying on the sand
I let my spirit dissappear
From this world
Fly away from you
Forgotten
Vanishing
I wished my mind
Could wander without pain
To the gleaming shelters
Hidden somewhere in the sun
Far away from this world
Far away from you
Lying on the sand i hear
The distant singing sea
And stare at lonely clouds
Fading above me
I wished my mind could join them
I wished my mind could wander free
To the gleaming shelters
Hidden somewhere in the sun
Far away from this world
Far away from you
So far away2Embed
