Spending My Time Lyrics
What's the time? Seems it's already morning
I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue
The TV's on, but the only thing showing is a picture of you

Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee
I try to read a bit, but the story is too thin
I thank the Lord above that you're not here to see me
In this shape I'm in

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time

I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
Oh help me please, is there someone who can make me
Wake up from this dream?

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too
I'm spending my time (spending my time)
Watching the sun go down (I fall asleep)
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "Tears of a Clown"
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time
My friends keep telling me, "Hey, life will go on"
Time will make sure I'll get over you, ooh
This silly game of love - you play, you win only to lose
Ohuhohuhoh

I'm spending my time (spending my time, spending my time)
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time (spending my time, spending my time)
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "Tears of a Clown"
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time

(Spending my time)
I can't live without your love
(Spending my time)
Uh, I'm spending my time, my time, my time
Bed's too big without you honey, honey
(Spending my time)Embed
