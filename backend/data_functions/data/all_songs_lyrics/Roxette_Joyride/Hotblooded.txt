Hotblooded LyricsHotblooded
You know I'm hotblooded, baby ...
Get on up and kick it all the systems
Are you ready to go
Well, are you ready or not?
Hey, I gotta know!
Baby lay down the blues
And let those guitars bleed
I'm everything you wanted
I'm all you ever need
Cos I'm hotblooded, hotblooded
I need your lovin'
I need your love so bad
Flash all the lights
I'll be a camera tonight
I'll snap the look on your face
When I'm squeezing you tight
Yea, sister a-soul, we gotta burn this old house down
Keep on beatin' those drums
Keep on pumpin' up that sound
Yea yea yea yea yea
Hotblooded, I'm hotblooded
I need your lovin'
I need your love so bad
I'm hotblooded, hotblooded
You gotta know it
I need a shot of love so bad
I stay up late where the night's alive
No sleep at all I work nine to five
It's honey do that and honey do this:
"Can I call you home?"
"Can I call you home?"
- you can call me miss ...Embed
