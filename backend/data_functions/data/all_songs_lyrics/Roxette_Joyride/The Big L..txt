The Big L. LyricsShe's the top, she's got the world on a string
She makes me boogie, makes me do anything yeah yeah
Hey now, touch the sky
You've got a certain kind of look in your eyes
Well, she's a miracle, she's all that I need
Like the water and the air that I breathe yea yea
Hey now, reach the sky
There's a certain kind of look in your smile
And I know what love can do
Yes I know what hearts can do
The big love is taking the wheel
The big love goes head over heels
The big lust, bring it into
The small world, the bigger the better
Big love, waiting to catch the big one
Head over heels
The big one, bring it into the small world
I'm building the big big love
I'm building the big big love
It's kinda strange , a bit mysterious
I got to take it oh so so serious
Hey now, touch the sky
You've got a certain kind of look in your eyes
It used to be so hard, so lonely at night
Well, she's my baby and I'm feeling alright
Hey now, move the sky
There's a certain kind of look in that smile
When I'm making love with her, (I'm Making)
When I'm making lover to her yeah
The big love
The big love is taking the wheel
The big love goes head over heels
The big lust, bring it into
The small world, the bigger the better
Big love, waiting to catch the big one
Head over heels
The big one, bring it into the small world
I'm building the big big love
Yeah! I'm building the big big love
It has to be a big thing
It's bringing me to my knees
Has to be a big thing
Big thing
You know what I'm saying
The big love is taking the wheel
The big love goes head over heels
The big lust, bring it into
The small world, the bigger the better
Big love, waiting to catch the big one
Head over heels
The big one, bring it into the small world
I'm building the big big love
You know, I'm building the big big love
Big love, I'm building the big love
(Big love, big love, big love, big love, big love, big love...)Embed
