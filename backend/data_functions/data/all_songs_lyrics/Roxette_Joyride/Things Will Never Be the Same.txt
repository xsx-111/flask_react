Things Will Never Be the Same LyricsLay it down, pull my heart to the ground
Time's getting cold now the leaves all turn hard and blue
And I know when I gaze to the sun, no place to hide
I got nowhere to run from you, away from you
Hold me now
Girl, I don't know when
When we will ever meet again
That was then
Baby, this is now
I try to get over you
Losing you...
Things will never be the same
Can you hear me call your name?
If we changed it back again
Things would never be...
In your hand
Babe, I don't understand
You've got the eyes of a child
But you hurt like a man
Always do, always do
Touch me now, girl
I don't when
When we will ever meet again
That was then
Baby, this is now
Time won't get over you
Losing you...
Things will never be the same
Can you hear me call your name?
If we changed it back again
Things would never be...Embed
