Small Talk LyricsIt's not the chapters he reads
When you're feeling low down
It's not the touch of his skin
When you kiss him goodnight
It's not the money he spends
When you want to buy a daydream
And not that miracle smile
That makes the sky bright
It's not the way his hands behave
When you've turned out the light
It's the small small small talk
That makes it all happen
Small small small talk
That makes you want to fly
Yes it does
It's not the way he believes in you
Like a religion
It's not the thrill that you get
When his holding you tight
It's not the way his eyes persuade
You to stay the night
It's the small small small talk
That makes it all happen (just like that)
Small small small talk
That makes you feel like flying
Yes it does
Information, heart and soul
A whisper, a word
Confessions that have to be heard
Small small small talk
Small small small talk
Come on now
Come on now
Come on now
- you make it rock so heavenly
Come on now
Come on now
Come on
- you seem to talk so heavenly
Big words ...
Small talk ...Embed
