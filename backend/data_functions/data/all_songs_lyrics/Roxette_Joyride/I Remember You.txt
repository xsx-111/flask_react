I Remember You LyricsAre you ready? Go!
I hear your footsteps like you're walking
I hear your voice like you're talking to me
I can reach every moment
Every caress like I'm living a dream
Down to the bone, go little darling
Oh I remember you
Feels like it was yesterday
I remember you
You've got me running back again
You shared my secrets and my laughter
I fell in love with the light in your eyes
And I believed that summer
Would go on and on for the rest of my life
Down to the bone, go little darling
Hey I remember you
Feels like it was yesterday
I remember you
You've got me running back again
You've got me running
Na na na na
Na na na na
Down to the bone, go little darling
Hey I remember you
Feels like it was yesterday
I remember you
You've got me running back again
You've got me running
I say: na na na na
Na na na naEmbed
