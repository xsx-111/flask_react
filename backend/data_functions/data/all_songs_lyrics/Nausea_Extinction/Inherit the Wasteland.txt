Inherit the Wasteland LyricsExpanding new horizons
The age of humanity is past
A sterile new environment
Where emotion cannot last
A frail human weakness
That must be overcome
Your wretched laugh and feeble tears
Are now over and done
Anesthetize the feelings
Cauterize the mind
Life's simple joy is a luxury
That they will never find
Step into the light of day
We'll see to all your needs
Give up to us your children
So we may sow the seeds
Of a new and useless way of life
We call the status quo
We'll feed them lies of our new age
And off to work they'll go
To keep up peak production
We'll exploit their petty greed
If I work long and hard enough
Then someday I'll succeed
But when your use has ended
And you've worked long and hard
You'll see yourself a wasted mess
And permanently scarred
I'll inherit the wasteland
A technological dream
That's draining my life's blood
I'm chained to the machine
Sift through emotional wreckage
Weed the weak out from the strong
With the dawning of our master race
How can we go wrong?
Strong in body weak in mind
A total lack of thought
Drones work an anti-septic hive
That our tax dollars bought
Cleanliness and godliness
The lessons of the day
Step out of line
And you'll find out the price you have to pay
Technology will blossom
But soon it has to feed
Consuming all your wasted lives
To satisfy it's need
The path you took was futile
Because you were deceived
They told you, you were on your way
And that's what you believed
Until one day you saw the gray
That had become your life
A rocky barren wasteland
Of suffering, toil, and strife
They finally lost all use
For your spent mind and failing health
Now when you see your children
It reminds you of yourself
When you traveled down that "golden road"
That ended up in ruin
They will all fall victim to the system
That consumes themEmbed
