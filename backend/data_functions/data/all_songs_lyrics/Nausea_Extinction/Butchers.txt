Butchers LyricsThrough all your research there's still no cure for a disease like you
Ulcerated eyes show no glimmer of life
Nor do they reflect the pain inflicted by your knife
They're cancerous and bleeding
Better off dead
Vivisectionist you must be sick in the head
He's a contract killer for the company
To see how their products will effect you and me
The gruesome way in which these animals die
Makes you wonder what's in the products that you buy
From dogs forced to smoke your cigarettes
To the monkeys that suffer electrical shocks
Their crying eyes plead from inside a cage
Tortured because they'll never talkEmbed
