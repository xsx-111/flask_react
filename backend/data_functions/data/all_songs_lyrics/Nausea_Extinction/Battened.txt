Battened LyricsGoddess raped by god
Devouring our imminence
Famished for fear
We die
Sacrosanct arbiter
Subjugating the earth
Bastardizing spirituality
Demise
Consummate your venality
Battened by life's spoils
Placate your greed
We cry
Womyn and earth
Objectified
Brutalized
Profitised
Despiritualised
We die
The liesEmbed
