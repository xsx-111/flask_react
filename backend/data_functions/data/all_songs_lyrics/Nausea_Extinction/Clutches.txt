Clutches LyricsI am the non-creator
For man has created his own lord
I am the anti-master
For this lord god rules with a blood stained sword
Their slavery is based on deception
Their chains are tightly bound
The holders of the keys
Shall lock us to the ground
The power for the people
Not for their promised land
The power for the people
Their utopia shall crumble into sand
The created god on which you rely
Shall rule you until you die
The "book" continues to hold them
But still never questioned why
Would you allow your life to be taken
By the clutches of just one hand?
Would you allow your life to be taken
By the clutches of just one man?
Would you ever understand what their lies are about?
Will you ever understand?!!!Embed
