Sacrifice LyricsEqual rights and justice
A dream we must make true
Without a ruling nation
Free of racist fools
Let nature make the boundaries
Not power drunken scum
Who kill for greed and profit
Our lives ruled by their guns
How many lives today will the system take away?
In the name of their bloodlust and power hungry ways
If you're looking for the truth
All you'll find is lies
Another cover up
Another rebel crucified
He questioned their authority
They stole away his life
Riddled full of bullets
For opening people's eyes
The papers gave their stories
Of how peter tosh had died
But the people know the real truth
They won't believe those lies
Don't get to close
You'll be next on their list
CIA death squads make another hit
Government and murder going hand in hand
Like Hitler and his nazis
Here comes the final plan
Another rebel dies so their system can survive
They stop the people's rise by feeding them more lies
Another sacrifice so their shitstem shall survive
They blind the people's eyes with their politricks and lies
Another rebel dies so their hatred will survive
They shut the people's cries with murder and with liesEmbed
