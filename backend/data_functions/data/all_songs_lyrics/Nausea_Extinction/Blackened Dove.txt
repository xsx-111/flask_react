Blackened Dove LyricsReconstructing humyn nature for procurement and self promotion
Refining the skills that will exact humyn demotion
With the segregating strength of the stigmata issued
We create the carriers of our wrath
Innocence abused
The persecuted harbor bigots' sour venom
Masses fill the scapegoat roles in the social procession
Objectives first in mind
Tools carved for the trade
Sociopathic megalomaniacs
The by-products we create
Freedom taken
Ignorance remains
A blackened dove
Is a dove the same
Profited by this existence of expendable nature
Gambling with the tokens of sex, class and color
Population of oppressors
We rest assure
By paragons of despot
So greedily nurtured
Restrained and maintained by the strings held above
In the record grooves of our minds
We blame a blackened dove
Exploitive shield over the eyes
Remains only with permission of an ignorant mind
The hope for freedom is always darkened
By those who replace love for hate in the controls of our lives
Enlighten your minds
Recognize their devices
Freedom is a truth that lays just beyond their liesEmbed
