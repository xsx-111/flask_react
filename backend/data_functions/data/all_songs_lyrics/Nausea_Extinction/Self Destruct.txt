Self Destruct LyricsLook at this world man has created
People dependent on greed and hatred
Wars between religion
Wars between races
Still fighting battles
Their ancestors started
You destroy
You exploit
We condone
We self destruct
Blood money pours from every wound
Wars for profit selling weapons of doom
Destroying ourselves
Destroying our land
Taking the future from our children's hands
You destroy
You exploit
We condone
We self destruct
The graves of Auschwitz were not enough
Nagasaki, Hiroshima are a sea of blood
Did you forget Cambodia, Vietnam?
It was miles away in a primitive landEmbed
