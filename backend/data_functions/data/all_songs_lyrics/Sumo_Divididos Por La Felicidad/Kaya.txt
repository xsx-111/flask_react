Kaya Lyrics

Kaya-man come to Buenos Aires town
Bringing good news from the north, uh

Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya (Singing loud and clear now)
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya, yeah

Let me tell you about something
Bigger than a big bamboo (Big bamboo)
And me and you (Me and you)
And the fat guru (Fat guru)
Let me tell you about something
Bigger than a big bamboo, yah (Big bamboo, yah)
And me and you (Me and you)
And the fat guru (Fat guru) well, I tell you it's

Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Don't you know one day
I used to be so mad
I'd treat my woman so bad
And then I get so sad
Don't you know one day
I used to be so mad, yah
I'd treat my woman so bad
And then I get so sad and then I smoked a little

Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
Kaya, oh-oh, Kaya
