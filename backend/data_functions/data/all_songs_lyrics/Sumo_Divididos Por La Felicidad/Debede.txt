Debede Lyrics

We walked down to the disco on that Saturday night
You know, you really looked good, you know, I felt all right
We walked to that Disco on that Saturday night
You know, I really looked good, you know, I felt all right

Disco, baby, Disco, when you're dying in your bed
Disco, baby, Disco, when you're crying in your head
Disco, baby, Disco, you don't know rock and roll
Disco, baby, Disco, is gonna satisfy your soul, yeah


Well I don't know, but I've been told
The streets of heaven are lined with gold
I don't know but I've been told
The streets of heaven are lined with gold
I wonder if it can get much worse
If the Russians get up there first? Eh? Ha, ha!

Disco, baby, Disco, do it when you're down
Disco, baby, Disco, do it upside down
Disco, baby, Disco, writhing in your bed
Disco, baby, Disco, you're dancing on your head, yeah
¡Cu-cu, cu-cu, cu-cu, chu-cho!
¡Cucurucho!
¡Disco!
