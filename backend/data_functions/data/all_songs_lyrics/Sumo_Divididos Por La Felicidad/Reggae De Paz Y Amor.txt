Reggae De Paz Y Amor Lyrics

Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Moving up, fighting it all back, stabbing
Gonna get you down tonight in Babylon town, yeah
'Cause if you fall on your face is no disgrace
No one's going to help you anyhow, nowhere

Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, peace and love
Peace and love in Babylon
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, peace and love

Little-little people with little-little lives
In little-little homes with little-little wives
They get up, they go down, they get out town, yeah
Everybody moving round and round
I don't care and I don't eat
I don't eat no meat
And as civilized citizen Ronald Reagan
Uuhhh!
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, peace and love
Peace and love for all damn world!
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, peace and love
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, peace and love (Â¡Oh, yeah!)
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, peace and love


Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, peace and love
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh, peace and love
OhEmbed
