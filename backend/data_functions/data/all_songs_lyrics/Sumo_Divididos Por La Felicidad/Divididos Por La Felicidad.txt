Divididos Por La Felicidad Lyrics

I'm always breaking glasses in other people's rooms
Forever making passes at other people's tumbs
No matter what existed a few short years ago
The happy days were busted and that's the way things go

What a good time
What a lovely time
What a good time
What a lonely time

Agosto, agosto
Jopo, perra
Perra, ¡perra!

And if I had some trousers
I'd walk right down the street
And if I had a mauser
I'd shoot everyone I meet

What a good time
What a lovely time
What a good time
What a lonely time
Agosto, agosto
Jopo
Perra, perra
Perra, ¡perra!

Well I'm still breaking glasses in other people's rooms
Forever making passes at other people's tumbs
No matter what existed a few short years ago
The happy days were busted and that's the way things go

What a beautiful time
What a lovely time
What a beautiful time
What a lonely time

Agosto, agosto
Perra, perra
¡Perra!Embed
