Regtest Lyrics

Some call this happy valley rock

Play I some music, Lord, I hope I won't come on too strong
You can refuse it, yeah, but you know, you might be wrong
You could call it "Reggae", you couldn't call it "Rock and roll"
Come on, get ready, 'cause there's a big ball going to roll

You'd better get up brother, up brother, up brother, up, yeah
Don't you go too far
You'd better come down brother, down brother, down brother, down, yeah
Like a shooting star

I had a dream, oh yeah, in 1973
Dreamt a spaceship, come down to deliver me
Well it was big and white and it had come a long, long way, oh yeah
A black star liner? Yeah, well you know, I could not say

But it took me up brother, up brother, up brother, up, yeah
It took me far
Then it brought me down brother, down brother, down brother, down, yeah
Like a shooting star

Still play my music, I hope I don't come on too strong
You can't refuse it, Lord, but you know, you might be wrong
You could call it "Reggae", you couldn't call this "Rock and roll"
Come on, get ready, 'cause there's a big ball going to roll

You'd better get up brother, up brother, up brother, up, yeah
Don't you go too far
You'd better come down brother, down brother, down brother, down, Lord
Like a shooting star

Skidubidy-yah, Skidubidy-yah, Skidubidy-yah Skidubidy-yah, Skidubidy-yah dubidy dubidy
Sken, sken sken Lord, no, no, noEmbed
