No Acabes Lyrics

Don't come
Don't come
Don't come
Don't come


Don't come
Don't come
Don't come
Don't come

Living here in Babylon is, oh, so difficult
I really don't know what to do
Think I'll go to Africa, maybe Ethiopia
I really hope that you'll come too

I hear a little voice, it says...

Don't come
Don't come
Don't come
Don't come
Last Saturday night, had a fight with my baby
I don't think I'll see her again
She never says "no" but she always says "maybe"
And that's no way to treat a friend

I hear a little voice, it says...

Don't come
Don't come (You hear me now?)
Don't come (Over)
Don't come (Right!)


Don't come
Don't come
Don't come (Don't come no more)
Don't come, yeahEmbed
