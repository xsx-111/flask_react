Mula Plateada Lyrics

Silver moon is, oh, so distant
In her black black distant sky
Silver moon is also crying
I don't think she knows just why
Silver moon is, oh, so puzzled
By the ways of her new life
Silver moon is not a girlfriend
Silver moon could be my wife

Silver moon, shine down
Silver moon, come down
Silver moon, I'm here
Silver moon, you're there

Silver moon is always watching
But she can't really see
Silver moon is always writing
Like the waves write on the sea
Silver moon is always laughing
When she should really cry
Silver moon is like a window
Like a door into the sky
Silver moon, shine down
Silver moon, come down
Silver moon, I'm here
Silver moon, you're there
