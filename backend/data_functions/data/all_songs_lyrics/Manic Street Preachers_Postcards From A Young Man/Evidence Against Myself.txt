Evidence Against Myself LyricsI don't need a lawyer to convict my soul
It's the only decent thing living in my bones
The evidence against myself is compelling, it's so compelling
It's hard to avoid all the things you've been saying
Things you've been saying, things you've been saying
The truth hurts, baby, when you're stuck in denial
Bury it all in the belly of a song
Then all my flaws will become invisible
The evidence against myself is compelling, it's so compelling
Gotta keep moving on, 'cause it stops me from feeling
Stops me from feeling, stops me from feeling
The truth hurts, baby, when you're stuck in denial
The evidence against myself is compelling, it's so compelling
It's hard to avoid all the things you've been saying
Things you've been saying, things you've been saying
Gotta keep moving on, 'cause it stops me from feelingEmbed
