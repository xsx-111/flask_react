I Think I Found It Lyrics
I think I've found it
And I think I love it
Buried in the dirt
Hiding from the light

So I walked to the sea
Threw a pebble in for you and me
A day of wine and roses
Has made me feel alive
My letter was burnt
But your words were wise
For mystery and youth
Must surely collide
A song of anti-matter
Which might explain the absence
Of any precious jewels of truth
To save mankind


My letter was burnt
But your words were wise
For mystery and youth
Must surely collide
 
These things I've seen
Bring tears to my eyes
Live with me through
The threads of your livesEmbed
