Auto-Intoxication Lyrics
The more I want to be me
The less I know myself
The living left to die
While ghosts are brought to life

Welcome to the new slave trade
Drained of delusion and buried in debt
How the hell did we find each other
Suffering auto intoxication

The disasters not coming
It's already arrived
I am so lucky
I think that I survived

I am what I am, my body belongs to me
My work will set me free and fulfils my dreams
A new economy embraces the ruins
It makes us strong and soothes our fears
