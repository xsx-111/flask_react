Some Kind of Nothingness Lyrics
The sky is falling in on you
Crushed any happiness you knew
That tree gave more to you than love
It still there but baby, you're gone

Remember you stretched out in the sun
All alone forever, conclusions foregone
Will you find some kind of nothingness
Still and lonely like an old school photograph

Laid yourself out under the stars
Some peace at last so don't be sad
A fitting end to your "end"
But "baby death's our only friend"


Your future glories all empty of thoughts
There's beauty doing nothing at all
It's what you wanted, it's what you got
Your final search for truth has stopped
There's beauty doing nothing at all
Never, never stop
