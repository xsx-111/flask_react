Golden Platitudes Lyrics
The platitudes they all dissolved
They got too deep, got too involved
The platitudes just interludes
To break the trust with me and you

Oh, what a shangri-la
Oh, what a shower we are
Oh, what a mess we've made
What happened to those days
When everything seemed possible
With no one to tell you no
Where did the feeling go
Where did it all go wrong
Born to be a communist
But then the marriage failed
As did the partnership


I fell back in love with love
I know that it might sound odd
The liberal left destroyed
Every bit of our youth
Left with the barest of bones
Leaving us all with holes
Where did it all go wrong
Where did the feeling go
Why colonize the moon
When every different kind
Of desperation exists

In every single home
Where did the feeling go 
Where did it all go wrongEmbed
