Hazelton Avenue Lyrics
The modern world sits so easily
A different kind of honesty
Yes, I worship at the altar
I am a happy consumer
A record shop and some clarity
Don't need a wilderness to feel solitary
Oh, don't need a wilderness

So take me back 
To Hazelton Avenue 

Motion coffee sleep, it's all I really need
Moving on, accept all my apologies
Oh, motion coffee sleep
Please accept all my apologies
Amongst the crowd the disconnect is sweeter
Alone in bed the joy is even deeper
I feel like I could write a best seller
