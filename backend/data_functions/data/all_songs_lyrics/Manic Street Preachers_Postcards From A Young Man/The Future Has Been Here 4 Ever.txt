The Future Has Been Here 4 Ever Lyrics
Wipe those tears away
Keep as still as you can
Hold your breath and dig deep
And stop those trembling hands
Make yourself pretty
Just for one last time
No one will ever know
You ever left your prime

The future has been here 4 ever
The future's still unclear whatever

This place it left me
A long, long time ago
But it still keeps me here
It still keeps me close
When I start to break free
It calls me back again
Like the Godfather 3
I never can escape

When you can't shake off
Your yesterdays
When you can't rewrite
Your histories
When you let some
Love break through the light
When you let someone
Come into your life, to your life

To your life Embed
