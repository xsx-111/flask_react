Red Rubber Lyrics
My idle ledgers have fiasco boss
Time to wake up kids of the cold war
Some scars so deep they'll never heal
Reparations pint glass unclean
Civilisation takes up many forms
Usually disguised and fatally flawed

White king - red rubber
Black death are you listening?
White king - red rubber
Free god together, so letâ€™s all sing

Oh Leopold, you betrayed our souls
Sold the heart of your country
For all the rubber and all the money
My idle ledgers have fiasco boss
Time to wake up kids of the cold war
Some scars so deep they'll never heal
Reparations pint glass unclean
Civilisation takes on many forms
Usually disguised and fatally flawed

White king - red rubber
Black death are you listening?
White king - red rubber
Free god together, so let's all songEmbed
