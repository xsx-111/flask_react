A Billion Balconies Facing the Sun Lyrics
We've finally found a way
To consume boredom every day
We've all become our personal gods
We've all become so sad and lost
So sad, so sad, so sad and lost

A billion balconies facing the sun
A billion faces turned to their screens
The perfect answer to camouflage our screams
A billion lies becoming the truth
An ecstasy of the eye
As wide as eternity tonight 

We found expression for our hate
Without any kind of consequence
Who needs patience anymore
When all our pleasure's virtual
Pleasure's, pleasure's, pleasure's virtual
