The Descent (Pages 1 & 2) Lyrics
Will my kingdom disappear and fade away?
Will sleep overcome the hurt and then decay?
I can't be poisoned and you will not make me cry
I've cleansed my ugliness and cleansed my paranoia

The winner takes it all
My baby teeth are gone
Into a better place that I have yet to go
Will I burn or will I pray?
Will sleep consume my waking days?
Descent is getting steeper day by day

This is my last descent
I hope I'm making sense
I've lost my last defence
This is my last descent

Have my expectations gone too far again?
Do I have the courage of the books I've read?
Do you understand the pain we're going through?
There is no need to leave me beaten black and blue
