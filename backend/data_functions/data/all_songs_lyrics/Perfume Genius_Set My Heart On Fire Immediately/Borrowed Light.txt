Borrowed Light LyricsNo, God
Not this time
No satellite
Just be here, Jamie
Just let that old thing die
No sun
Hangs outside
Just borrowed light
Now match my breathing
Now rest your hand in mine
I thought the sea would make some pattern known
And swim us safely home
But there's no secret
Just an undertow1Embed
