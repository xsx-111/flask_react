Describe Lyrics
No bells anymore
Just my stomach rumbling

Can you describe them for me?
Can you describe them for me?

The lock on the door
Is barely holding

Can you just wait here with me?
Can you just wait here with me?

Ooh, his lovin' felt like ribbons
Ooh, an echo in the canyon
Ooh, his lovin' felt like ribbons
Ooh, an echo in the canyon

Can you just find him for me?
Can you describe them for me?
Can you just find him for me?2Embed
