Nothing at All Lyrics
Right on time
Set me free, don't wait
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Soul on fire
Baby, say my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You can say what you want but I already know
Our body is breaking down to a single beat
The sadness you carry, it hangs like a ghost
And I'll just tear it down and I'll wear it like a ribbon
Give it

I got what you want, babe
I got what you need, son
I got what you want, babe
I got what you need, son
I got what you want, babe
I got what you need, son
I got what you want, babe
I got what you need, son
Nothing
Nothing at all
Right on time
Set me free, don't wait
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Soul on fire
Baby, say my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You can say what you want but I already know
Our body is breaking down to a single beat
The sadness you carry, it hangs like a ghost
And I'll just tear it down and I'll wear it like a ribbon

I got what you want, babe
I got what you need, son
I got what you want, babe
I got what you need, son
I got what you want, babe
I got what you need, son
I got what you want, babe
I got what you need, son
Nothing
Nothing at allEmbed
