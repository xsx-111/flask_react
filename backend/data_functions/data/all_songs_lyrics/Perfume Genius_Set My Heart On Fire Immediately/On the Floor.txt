On the Floor LyricsI'm trying, but still, I close my eyes (Mmm)
The dreaming, bringing his face to mine
Lock the door
The constant buzzing all through the night (Mmm)
The fighting rips me all up inside
On the floor
I pace, I run my mouth
I pray and wait
I cross out his name on the page
How long 'til this washes away?
How long 'til my body is safe?
How long 'til I walk in the light?
How long 'til this heart isn’t mine?
The rise and fall of his chest on me (Mmm)
I'm trying, but still, it's all I see
The violent current of energy (Mmm)
I hide it away and underneath
Lock the door
I shake, I promise every day to change
I cross out his name on the page
How long 'til this washes away?
How long 'til my body is safe?
How long 'til I walk in the light?
How long 'til this heart isn’t mine?
Take this wildness away
Wildness away
Wildness away
Ah, ah
I'm trying, but still, I close my eyes (Mmm)
The dreaming, bringing his face to mine
Out the door
I pace, I run my mouth
I pray to change
I cross out his name on the page
How long 'til this washes away?
How long 'til my body is safe?
How long 'til this heart isn't mine?
I just want him in my arms
I just want him in my arms15Embed
