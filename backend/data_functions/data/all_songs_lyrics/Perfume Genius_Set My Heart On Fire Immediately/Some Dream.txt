Some Dream LyricsEndlessly
Lazy and dumb
I lick the day
Like salt from some dream
And bright colored rings
I gather all night
And snuff out the gleam
'Til no spirit shines
How hard can it be?
She calls out for me
But never loud enough
I know you called me and I didn't pick up
I was busy freaking out, yeah
And all that time spent perfecting my look
Now there's nobody around, yeah
And all the times spent defending my look
Now it's misery
Just a whistle in the reeds
And I'm stuck listening
All I meant to love is gone to the ground
Gone the minute I stepped out and looked around
All I meant to love is gone to the ground
Gone the minute I stepped out and looked around
All this for a song?
All this for a song?1Embed
