Just a Touch LyricsTouch me deep
Before you leave
Just enough
To find me
The promise in your eye
To hold our secret so tight
Take my song and hide
Take my song in hiding
Hum the melody
Touch me deep
Before you leave
Every move in time
The sun on your side
I keep every line
I'll trace them now
On mine
Take my song in hiding
Hum the melody2Embed
