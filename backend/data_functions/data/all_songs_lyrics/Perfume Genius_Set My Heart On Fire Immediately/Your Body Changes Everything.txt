Your Body Changes Everything Lyrics
Give me your weight, I'm solid
Hold me up, I'm falling down
Give me your weight, I'm solid
Hold me up, I'm falling down now, babe

Your body changes everything
You are anchoring
Until you fit beneath me
And you're breaking like a wave
Your body changes everything
I can hardly breathe
And now you're right above me
And your shadow suffocates

Can you feel my love?
Do you feel the same?
Can you feel the sun, like honey?
The camera cut away

Give me your weight, I'm solid
Hold me up, I'm falling down
Give me your weight, I'm solid
Hold me up, I'm falling down now, babe, oh, oh yeah
Your body changes everything
You are anchoring
Until you fit beneath me
And you're breaking like a wave
Our body changes everything
I can hardly breathe
And now you're right above me
And your shadow suffocates

Your brow, it is mine to beat
Can you feel my love?
Can you feel the sun like honey?
The camera cut away

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know3Embed
