Jason Lyrics
Ooh-ooh, ooh

Jason undressed me
Lying on his sheets
He did not do the same
Even his boots were on
Ooh-ooh, ooh

Clumsy, shakily
He ran his hands up me
He was afraid
Tears streaming down his face
Ooh-ooh, ooh

Jason, there's no rush
I know a lot comes up, ooh
Letting in some love
Where there always should have been some

I was proud to seem
Warm and mothering
Just for a night
Even through all the drink
Ooh-ooh, ooh
We were twenty-three
Breeders on CD
When we woke up
He just asked me to leave
Ooh-ooh, ooh

I stole twenty from his blue jeans
I'm pretty sure that he saw me2Embed
