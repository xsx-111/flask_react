Whole Life LyricsHalf of my whole life is gone
Let it drift and wash away
It was just a dream I had
It was just a dream
Half of my whole life is done
Heather gathers in its place
It was just a dream I had, mmm
It was just a dream
The mark where he left me
A clip on my wing
Oh, let it soften
I forgive everything
I once hummed the seasons
Now, I'm whistling
Half of my whole life is done
Let it drift and wash away, mmm
Shadows soften toward some tender light
In slow motion, I leave them behind2Embed
