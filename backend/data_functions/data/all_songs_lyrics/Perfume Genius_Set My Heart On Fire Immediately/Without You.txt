Without You Lyrics
It's the strangest feeling
Unknown even
Almost good
It's a blurry shape
It's a jumbled tape
But sound

It's enough, not too loud
Just enough to find the trace
It's enough, in the mirror
I can almost find your face

You know it's been such a long, long time
Without you
Without you

It's the strangest feeling
Unknown even
Almost good
With the dark still swinging
So long chasing
Satisfaction's a lowly thing
Or so she tells me
Underneath the feeling
I'm feeling something
When the center falls out
At least I'll have the spring

You know it's been such a long, long time
Without you
Without you

It's the strangest feeling
Unknown even
Almost good
With the dark still swinging
It's enough, not too loud (So long chasing)
Just enough to find the trace (Satisfaction's a lowly thing)
(Or so she tells me)
It's enough, in the mirror (Underneath the feeling)
I can almost find your face
(I'm feelin' something)
It's enough, in the mirror (When the center falls out)
I can almost find a trace
(At least I'll have the spring)
You know it's been such a long, long time
Without you1Embed
