Moonbend Lyrics
Carving his lung
Ribs fold like fabric
Moon sketch the line
Moon bend the knife

Shine the color
Cast him in violet
Curtain close my eyes
Take his light from mine

Holding his tongue
I read the classics
Burrowed in his spine
Now I'm learning Spanish

Take his light from mine
Take his light from mine2Embed
