Small Stakes Lyrics
Small stakes
Give you blues
But you don't feel taken
Don't think you've been used

'Cause it's alright Friday night to Sunday
It feels alright, keeps your mind on the page
Oh yeah, small stakes ensure you the minimum blues
But you don't feel taken and you don't feel abused
Small stakes tell you that there's nothing can do
Can't think big, can't think past one or two and alright!
Yeah, alright!

Me and my friends
Sell ourselves
Short but feel
Very well

We feel fine
Aw, we feel fine
And small time danger in your midsize car
I don't dig the Stripes but I'll go for Har Mar
The big innovation on the minimum wage
Is lines up your nose but your life on the page, so c'mon
Tell me I'm wrong
Small stakes
Will kill time
When you're stuck
In back of the line

It feels alright Friday night to Sunday
Aw, it feels alright, keeps your mind on the page
And small stakes bring you where you're caught in a rut
You feel so uptight, you just want to throw it all up
And small stakes leave you with the minimum blues
Can't think big, can't think past one or two, so c'monEmbed
