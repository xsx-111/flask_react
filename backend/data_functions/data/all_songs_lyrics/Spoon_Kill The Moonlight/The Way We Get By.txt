The Way We Get By Lyrics
We get high in back seats of cars
We break into mobile homes
We go to sleep to "Shake Appeal"
Never wake up on our own

That's the way we get by
To way we get by
And that's the way we get by
To way we get by

We go out in stormy weather
We rarely practice discern
We make love to "Some Weird Sin"
We seek out the taciturn

That's the way we get by
To way we get by
And that's the way we get by
To way we get by
That's the way we get by
To way we get by, to way
That's the way we get by
That's the way we get by
We found a new kind of dance in a magazine
Tried it out it's like nothing you ever seen
You sweet talk like a cop and you know it
You bought a new bag of pot, said let's make a new start

And that's the way to my heart
The way to my heart
That's the way we get by
So way we get by
That's the way we get by
So way we get by, so way
That's the way we get by
That's the way we get by

We get high in back seats of cars
We put faith in our concerns
Fall in love to "Down on the Street"
We believe in the sum of ourselves

That's the way we get by
To way we get by
And that's the way we get by
So way we get by
That's the way we get by
To way we get by, to way
That's the way we get by
That's the way we get by3Embed
