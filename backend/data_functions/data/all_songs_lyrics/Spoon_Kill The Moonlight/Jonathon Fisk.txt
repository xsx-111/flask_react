Jonathon Fisk Lyrics
Maybe you remember, maybe you're locked away
Maybe we'll meet again some better day, some better life
Mmm, Jonathon Fisk speaks with his fists
Can't let me walk home on my own
And just like a knife, down on my life
So many ways to set me right

It's such a long way home
It's how the story goes
And it's like atom bombs and blunt razors
Atom bombs and blunt razors

Jonathon then says it's a sin
But he don't think twice 'cause, to him
Religion don't mean a thing
It's just another way to be right-wing
Just like a knife, down on my life
So many ways to set it right
That's how it goes
That's how the story goes

It's such a long way home
You're too old to understand
'Cause I just want to get home now
I just want to get home now
Jonathon's right down on my life
So many ways to set me right
On the long walk home
That's how the story goes
And Jonathon Fisk, always a risk
Tells me he counts my teeth every night
I want to get 'em all back now
I want to get 'em all back
And I want to turn him around1Embed
