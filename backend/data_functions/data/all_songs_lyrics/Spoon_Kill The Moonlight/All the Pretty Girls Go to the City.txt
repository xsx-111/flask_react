All the Pretty Girls Go to the City Lyrics
All the pretty girls go to the city
Don't they, don't they do, my love
Oh, it's something to see, they're so pretty
High-heel shoes, low-neck sweaters, acting so tough

Hear 'em go do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do

And they know that they'll make it alright
I say, don't they now, don't they now, don't they, my love?
Don't they now, don't they now, don't they, my love?

Jacqueline and Beth went to the city now
Left home soon as they were old enough
'Cause all the pretty girls go to the city now
Don't they, don't they do, don't they do that, my love?

And they go do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do
Do d-do d-do
I said, don't they now, don't they now, don't they, my love?
Don't they now, don't they now, don't they, my love?Embed
