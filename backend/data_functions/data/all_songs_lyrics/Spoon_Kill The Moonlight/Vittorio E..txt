Vittorio E. LyricsI took a river and it wouldn't let go
I want you to stay and I want you to go
I took a river and the river was long
It goes on
I want to be there tonight
I want to get there but it's just out of sight
I took a river and felt so slight
So hold on
So hold on
And hold on
It goes on
It goes on
I took a river and the river was long
I want you to stay course, I want you to go
I took a river and the river was long and goes on
It goes on
Ooh, it goes on
It goes onEmbed
