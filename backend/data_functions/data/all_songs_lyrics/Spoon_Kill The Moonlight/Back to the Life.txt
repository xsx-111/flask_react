Back to the Life LyricsSon, you must go back to the life
Go pack your bags
Take up your scythe
'Cause this world wasn't meant for us both
Who made the night?
Who made the day?
Who gave you life?
Who gave you say?
I said this world wasn't meant for us both
Who rules the day?
Who rules the night?
Go pack your bags
Take up your scythe
I said this world wasn't meant for us bothEmbed
