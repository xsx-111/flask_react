Something to Look Forward To Lyrics
Ooh, now, Carole, don't get ahead of yourself
Don't say nothing right now
'Cause, ooh, I'll take it anywhere you let it go

Everything moving so fast
It'll take you a place where you can't get back
And I've seen it enough
You got to make me shut up

So there's something to look forward to
Ooh, give me something to look forward to

Your mistakes
Your merciless eye
Your Chicago manual of style
It only's got to go just as far as we let it go
So, Carole, let me know

So many things we could say
So many things we could let get out
But you stay in instead
Some things are best left unsaid
Give me something to look forward to
Ooh, now, now, give me something to look forward to
Ooh, give me something to look forward to
Give me something to look forward to1Embed
