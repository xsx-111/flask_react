Someone Something Lyrics
Everything moves so fast
I should know it won't last
Take some stock, what you are
What you see, what you got

It tells me true
I want a connection to
Someone, something
Edge of a knife
Been missing it all my life
Someone, something
Someone or something
Someone, something
Someone, something

They get you where you live
Don't go back
You can't go back again

Yes, it's true
Just a connection to
Someone, something
Been up all night
Feel like sucking an Armalite
Someone, something
Everything moves so fast
I should know it won't last

I want a settled life
I want to be calm and polite
Someone, something
I'll get this right when I get there now
Someone, something

Someone, something
Someone or something
Someone, somethingEmbed
