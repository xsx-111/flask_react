Remorse Lyrics"The killer drove an ingot into each of his own eyes, then cut off his head"
Captivated
In their hearts and souls
The fear and desire
Just won't let go
Naive as it seems
We all want control
You're paralysed
When panic sets in
Quietly you drown
In your sleep
We once had a passion
It all seemed so right
So young and so eager
No end in sight
But now we are prisoners
In our own hearts
Nothing seems real
It's all torn apart
No-one knows
Where to draw the line
Accusations
A pledge of mine
In power we trust
We can't get out
The time we spend fighting
The anger and hate
Hope for tomorrow
Is never too late
We all turn to dust
On heaven's command
Time moves by fast
No second chance
We once had a passion
It all seemed so right
So young and so eager
No end in sight
But now we are prisoners
In our own hearts
Nothing seems real
It's all torn apart
The anger and hate
It's never too late
With no knowing now
The end is nearEmbed
