Gun Lyrics"The human hearts that I have taken into hell"
"Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby"
"I didn't hit nobody without no provocation
I mean, I didn't say nothing to the man
I didn't pull out no gun and tell him that I was gonna
Do this to him and shoot him. And he just shoots at me
Thats was a perfectly radical group right there if you ask me"
"Frontline!"
"American"
March to the rhythm
Fists in the air
Statues torn down
Burning flags everywhere
Atrocity starts now
The weapons parade
A nation in turmoil
Reflected by hate
Believe
Believe in the fight
Believe
Believe in the right
A paradox of discipline
Only the strong will win
Kneel to the man
Who's pointing the gun
A victory
Or nothing at all
"Quantum moves"
Discipline
Discipline
"Listen to me, or we'll all be killed"
Move ahead
Move ahead
"American"
"Corruptor of justice and innocence and youth"
A paradox of discipline
Only the strong will win
Kneel to the man
Who's pointing the gun
A victory
Or nothing at all
Victory
The State must fall
"Sworn enemy of all the human race"Embed
