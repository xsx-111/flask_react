Outcast Lyrics"And even though he was crazy, Go now!"
Abusive and reclusive
No self-motivation
A view so cruel
He's nobody's fool
Manipulated tension
Underneath the anger
Inverted and repulsive
Progression and rejection
On the fringe
The outcast grins
Spellbound motivation
Broken circles
He's lost compassion for his life
That tempered angle
Changing sights
Lost inhibitions
One by one
He takes them down
Unconsciously they hit the ground
Amnesia sets in
A killer
On the binge
Strange voices
From within
When you sleep
He preys on you
Unconscious levels
Burn for you....
"And even though he was crazy, Go now!"Embed
