Bio-Mechanic Lyrics"Keeping the brain going with microshocks."
Melted faces
Fractured cells
Implanted memories
Syringe of hell
Crippled mutants
Strapped with chains
Tortured users
Laughing in pain
The track marks your spine, they say
Machines are humans
We're programmed that way
In God we trust
Empty vastness
You can't hear a sound
In space they float
Users unbound
The pulse it races
Chest is tight
A higher feeling
Censored with fright
"I believe in disease"
"I believe in pain, cruelty and infidelity"
Synthetic stimulant
Artificial plague
Demented erosion
Existence for a new way
In God we trust
In God we trustEmbed
