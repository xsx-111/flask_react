Final Impact LyricsHardened disciples
Feeling no pain
World domination
A restless day
A new dimension
A fatal impact
Disturbed conditions
Terror reigns
Pleasure constricts us
That is the way
Empty perversion
Crippled by fate
Hostile aggressions
Resentful mentor
Our strength is growing
We're here to stay
Unseen alliance
The sun is blackening
Memories fading
The final impact
The skin starts tearing
Exposed the weakness
A piercing blunder
Holds no restraint
Diverse communion
New revelation
A shrouded mortal
Bleeds all day1Embed
