Lifeline LyricsA fire burns
In your eye
You gasp, you suck
The line of life
Relentless
Relentless confusion
Day
Day after day
In the shadow
An angel cries
Hearts and minds
Torn by lies
Tormented conscience
Buried by weight
Innocence confused
By hate
Walking
Walking in silence
A ceremony
Of false ideals
The anguish and deceit
In the shadow
An angel cries
Hearts and minds
Torn by lies
Tormented conscience
Buried by weight
Innocence confused
By hate
Hard reality
Begins to set in
A hostile state
A steadfast dream
Creates blindness
The wound inside
Runs deep
"..inflicted heavy losses"
"There were no survivors"
In the shadow
An angel cries
Hearts and minds
Torn by lies
Tormented conscience
Buried by weight
Innocence confused
By hate
"There were no survivors"Embed
