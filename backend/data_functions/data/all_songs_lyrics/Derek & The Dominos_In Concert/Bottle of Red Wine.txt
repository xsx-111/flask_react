Bottle of Red Wine LyricsGet up; get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
I can't get up out of bed
With this crazy feeling in my head
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
You hear what I say?
Gonna love you anyway
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
I went to an all-night get together
And everyone I knew was there
Had the love that would last forever
Everywhere I looked, I saw you standing there
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
I can't get up out of bed
With this crazy feeling in my head
I said get up right now, oh oh
I said get up right now
Feel so bad this morning; got a terrible headache in my head
Do me a favor, baby, do me a favor please
Please get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up, get up; get your man a big big bottle of red wineEmbed
