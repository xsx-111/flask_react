Got to Get Better in a Little While LyricsDon't you know what's wrong with me?
I'm seeing things I don't want to see
Sniffing things that ain't no good for me
I'm going down fast, won't you say a prayer for me?
It's got to get better in a little while
It's got to get better in a little while
It's got to get better in a little while
It's got to get better in a little while
The sun's got to shine on my guitar someday
Revolution all across the land
Just like Sly, you got to take a stand
Please don't hurt nobody, don't knock them down;
Give them a helping hand to get off the ground
It's got to get better in a little while
It's got to get better in a little while
It's got to get better in a little while
It's got to get better in a little while
The sun's got to shine on my guitar someday
Still one thing that you can do;
Fall down on your knees and pray
I know the Lord's gonna answer you
Don't do it tomorrow, do it todayEmbed
