Roll It Over LyricsGo down easy and let me take my time
Go down easy and let me take my time
Rock me slow till I lose my mind
Roll it over, let's take it from behind
Roll it over, let's take it from behind
It's only love, God knows it ain't no crime
You don't know how much it means to be here in your arms
Roll it over
Roll it over
Go down easy and let me take my time
Go down easy and let me take my time
Rock me slow till I lose my mind
Roll it over, let's take it from behind
Roll it over, let's take it from behind
It's only love, God knows it ain't no crime
You don't know how much it means to be here in your arms
Roll it over
Roll it overEmbed
