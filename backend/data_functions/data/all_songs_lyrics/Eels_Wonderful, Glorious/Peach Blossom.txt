Peach Blossom LyricsOh man, feels so nice
That was a long cold night
But then the sun came out
To thaw the ice
Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the marigold
Oh look at her, she's got something to say
And I can't wait to hear it
Won't let her get away
Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the marigold
Oh yeah, oh my goodness
You gotta love what's happening here
There ain't nothing for me to fear
Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the marigold
Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the marigold
Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the marigold
Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the marigoldEmbed
