Open My Present LyricsI wanna open my present
Look at it rapped up in little pink bows
Packed up tight just waiting for me
To rip it open and set it free
Relieve my state, I just can't wait
I wanna open my present
Well I'm a good boy, I behave myself
I've been patient and waiting so long
But waiting any longer, it just feels wrong
I know it's great, I just can't wait
It's right in front of me
I can't stop thinking about it
What's the harm in letting me
Go no longer, living without it
I wanna open my present
Well, I've been working too hard for too long
Sayin' my prayers and gettin' my sleep
Been real quiet, not making a peep
I know it's great, I just can't wait
It's right in front of me
I can't stop thinking about it
What's the harm in letting me
Go no longer, living without it
I wanna open my present
Look at it wrapped up in little pink bows
Packed up tight just waiting for me
To rip it open and set it free
Relieve my state, I just can't wait
I wanna open my presentEmbed
