Kinda Fuzzy LyricsIn my heart there lives a little riddle
I’m always trying to find my way
Everything feels older in the morning
I’ll find an answer some day
But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But you know I’m alright
I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But the sun’s shining bright
Don’t mess with me, I’m up for a fight
It’s a tangled cobweb that I weave
The dusty room of an aching mind
Anything that keeps the sun rising
I got to see if I can find
But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But you know I’m alright
I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But the future looks bright
Don’t mess with me, I’m up for the fight
Riding through like an outlaw drifter
Never knowing which way to turn
In the moment I think I’ve got it
It’s gone
Pull the curtains open wide
Gotta know that I’m about it
Good God It’s another day
Don’t ever doubt it
You know I’m alright
I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
In my heart there lives a little riddle
I’m always trying to find my way
I don’t know what it’s going to take, man
I only need a little break, man
I know you know that I’m a good man
But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But you know I’m alright
I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But the sun’s shining bright
Don’t mess with me, I’m up for the fight
Yeah
Yeah, owEmbed
