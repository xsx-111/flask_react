Stick Together LyricsThwarted again missing in the crowd
A friendly voice calling clear and loud
My big mistake, thinking that I knew
How to get by independent of you
The imatures, they have the chance
Quick to forget who brought 'em to the dance
Loyalty is paramount to me
It's very clear we make a winning team
We gotta stick together
That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right
Stay confident, doin' I'm okay
With anything you may do or you may say
We're always in quite good company
If I'm with you and you know you are with me
It's me and you, taking all now our comers
Watching it fall and nothing could be funner
The challenges only make us stronger
Outlast 'em all, forever maybe longer
We gotta stick together
That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right
We gotta stick together
That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right
Battle stations, gotta made the guns now
Everywhere you look and now they try to take us down
We gotta stick together
That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right
We gotta stick together
Honorable the only thing to do
You count on me 'cause I gotta count on you
I'm gonna pay up everything I owe
You just get ready, this is the real show
We gotta stick together
That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right
We gotta stick together
That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right
Let's stick togetherEmbed
