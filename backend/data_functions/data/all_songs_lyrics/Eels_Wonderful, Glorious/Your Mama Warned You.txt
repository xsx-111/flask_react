Your Mama Warned You LyricsYour mama warned you, she was probably right
Said I be trouble all day and all night
She said my kind is not to take an old kind
She told them better was out there to find
Your mama warned you and she doesn't needs words
A life with him high that's for the birds
She said you listen and you take it from me
You just can't be what he needin to be
But you can't believe everything she says
There's a home called heaven within my head
You know that I mean well
Your mama warned you with an arrogant tone
Don't be a fool girl leave him alone
She so superior and so she just think
But I don't trust someone who's eyes never blink
No, you can't believe everything she says
There's a home called heaven within my head
You know that I mean well
All the things she'll never understand
I'll know she'll never be a fan
But she's not you
Your mama warned you, she was probably right
Said I be trouble all day and all night
She said my kind is not to take an old kind
She told them better was out there to find
And you can't believe everything she says
There's a home called heaven within my head
You know that I mean well
Your mama warned youEmbed
