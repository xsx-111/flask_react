New Alphabet LyricsYou know what? I'm in a good mood today
Well, I'm so happy it's not yesterday
Man it was brutal with plenty of tissues
I guess you could say that I had issues
Well it's looking good, I dug my way out
I'm changing up what the story's about
When the world stops making sense
Just takin' what you can get
When the people on the street
Start looking like silhouettes
When the words just sound like noise
I need a new alphabet
When the world stops making sense
I make a new alphabet
Small thinking people with their small thinking ways
I don't have time to hear what they say
This is my world, I'm staking my claim
Thanks for the invite, no thanks just the same
It's looking good now, full speed ahead
I'll live today, by tomorrow I'm dead
When the world stops making sense
Just takin' what you can get
When the people on the street
Start looking like silhouettes
When the words just sound like noise
I need a new alphabet
When the world stops making sense
I make a new alphabet
I see everything
It's crystal clear
It's here
You know what? I'm in a good mood today
Well, I'm so happy it's not yesterday
Man it was brutal, but it's all in the past
It's good to know that it don't have to last
When the world stops making sense
Just takin' what you can get
When the people on the street
Start looking like silhouettes
When the words just sound like noise
I need a new alphabet
When the world stoá¹—s making sense
I make a new alphabet
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohEmbed
