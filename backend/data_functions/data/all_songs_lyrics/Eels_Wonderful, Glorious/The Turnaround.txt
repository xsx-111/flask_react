The Turnaround LyricsAnother morning in the evening
Times strewn on the floor
And I don’t even know her name
Or if she lives here
Had enough but I want more
I don’t remember how I got here
And how long it’s been now
A day or two, maybe more
Home to home I spent the days
Never wandered anywhere
I always bit the hand that beat me
And they wrote me off
It was easy not to care
Never trusted anyone
Don’t see why I should now
Fade some blinking never fair
You’re all gonna be sorry
When I leave town
And get it together
For the turnaround
Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the street
Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the street
Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the street
Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the street
Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the streetEmbed
