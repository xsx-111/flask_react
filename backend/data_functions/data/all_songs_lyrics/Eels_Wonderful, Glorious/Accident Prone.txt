Accident Prone LyricsA happy accident
Me running into you
Was off of my beaten path
God lost from my crew
Out of my element
Lost hold of the wheel
I didn't anticipate
A pleasant ordeal
I was getting tired of
Always being alone
Good thing that I've always been so
Accident prone
What made me go that way
Well I really don't know
Who do I have to thank?
To what do I owe?
I was feeling so bereft
All my chances blown
Good think that I've always been so
Accident prone
I was getting tired of
Always being alone
Good thing that I've always been so
Accident prone
A happy accident
Me running into you
Who do I have to think?
To what do I owe?Embed
