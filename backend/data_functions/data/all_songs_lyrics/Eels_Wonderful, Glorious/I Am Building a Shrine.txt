I Am Building a Shrine LyricsI am building a shrine
Deep inside my heart
It’s filled with all the little things
I’ll take when I depart
All the love you bring me
All the tender words you sing me
And all the suns within your smile
All the wisdom of your ways
Enduring endless days
And all the love that never dies
Deep down in the cold ground
Such a sad place to be
But I'll be fine with all the little things
That I’m taking with me
All the love you bring me
All the tender words you sing me
And all the suns within your smile
All the wisdom of your ways
Enduring endless days
And all the love that never dies
All the love you bring me
All the tender words you sing me
And all the suns within your smile
All the wisdom of your ways
Enduring endless days
And all the love that never dies
All the love you bring me
All the tender words you sing me
And all the suns within your smile
All the wisdom of your ways
Enduring endless days
And all the love that never diesEmbed
