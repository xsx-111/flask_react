True Original LyricsShe’s a true original
Not some store bought rebel
She can find her own way home
You just have to let her
Whichever path she finds
It’s hers to take
And if she says she’s fine
You just have to wait for her
She’s an artist in the world
She composes from the heart
The finished song is always there
Well before she starts
And any time she might
Get the words wrong
You just turn it up and you
You sing along with her
And if a gun was pointed at her
I would stand between the bullet and her
And if not being with me is what makes her happy
I’d take that bullet too
Which ever path she finds
It’s hers to take
And if she says she’s fine
I’ll just have to wait for her
She’s a true originalEmbed
