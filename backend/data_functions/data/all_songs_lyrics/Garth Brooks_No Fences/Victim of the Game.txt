Victim of the Game Lyrics
Well, it took a little time, but I guess you finally learned
That promises get broken and bridges do get burned
You've been siftin' through the ashes, just tryin' to find a flame
Holdin' onto nothin', you're a victim of the game

You were standin' way too close to see it all fall apart
And there were things you couldn't hear, 'cause you were listenin' with your heart
But you can't say I didn't warn you, now there's no one else to blame
There's no one quite as blind as a victim of the game

And it don't matter who you are
It treats everyone the same
All you need's a heart
To be a victim of the game

You know it's really gettin' to you, when you take to tellin' lies
And you can try to fool your friends, but you can't look 'em in the eyes
There ain't no standin' tall in the shadow of the shame
When everybody knows that you're a victim of the game

And it don't matter who you are
It treats everyone the same
And all you need's a heart
To be a victim of the game
Oh, you know, when I look into your eyes I can really feel the pain
Starin' in the mirror at a victim of the gameEmbed
