Same Old Story Lyrics
While they dance, how she holds him
Pulls him close and loves him so
While he dreams of another
And counts the days until he lets her go

Same old story
That everybody knows
It's one heart holdin' on
And one letting go

While they write, Lord, he tells her
How they two will settle down
But she only hears the highway
And a voice in some other town

And the harder he holds her
The more she slips away

Same old story
That everybody knows
It's one heart holdin' on
And one letting go
Same old storyEmbed
