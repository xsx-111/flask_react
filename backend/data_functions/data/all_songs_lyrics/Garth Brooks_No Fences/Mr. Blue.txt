Mr. Blue Lyrics
Our guardian star lost all its glow
The day that I lost you
It lost all its glitter the day you said no
And its grey skies turned to blue
Like him I am doubtful
That your love is true
So if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue, when you say you love me
Then prove it by goin' out on the sly
Provin' your love is untrue
Call me Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue, when you say you're sorry
Then turn around headed for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue

I sleep alone each night
Wait by the phone each night
But you don't call, and I won't hurt my pride
Call me mister...
I won't tell you, when you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue

I sleep alone each night
Wait by the phone each night
But you don't call, and I won't hurt my pride
Call me mister...
I won't tell you, when you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue

Call me Mr. Blue
Call me misterEmbed
