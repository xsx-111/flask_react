Unanswered Prayers Lyrics
Just the other night at a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them, the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if He'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because He doesn't answer doesn't mean He don't care
'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me, in her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days, there wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what He's doin', after all

And as she walked away, well, I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord for the gifts in my life
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because He may not answer doesn't mean He don't care
'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers4Embed
