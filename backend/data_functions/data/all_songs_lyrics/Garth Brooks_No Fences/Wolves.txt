Wolves Lyrics
January's always bitter
But, Lord, this one beats all
The wind ain't quit for weeks now
And the drifts are ten feet tall
I've been all night drivin' heifers
Closer in to lower ground
Then I spent the mornin' thinkin'
About the ones the wolves pulled down

Charlie Barton and his family
Stopped today to say goodbye
He said the bank was takin' over
The last few years were just too dry
And I promised that I'd visit
When they found a place in town
Then I spent a long time thinkin'
About the ones the wolves pulled down

Lord, please shine, a light of hope
On those of us who fall behind
And when we stumble in the snow
Could You help us up, while there's still time?
Well, I don't mean to be complainin', Lord
You've always seen me through
And I know You got Your reasons
For each and every thing you do
But tonight outside my window
There's a lonesome mournful sound
And I just can't keep from thinkin'
About the ones the wolves pulled down

Oh, Lord, keep me from bein'
The one the wolves pulled down1Embed
