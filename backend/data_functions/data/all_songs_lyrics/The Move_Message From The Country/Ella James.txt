Ella James LyricsSweet little girls in the money
Now she don't wanna know me at all ooh ooh
Who's she gonna use?
What's he gonna lose?
Been with Ella James too long
Time to get up but I can't afford a cab
To the job where I work not at all ooh ooh
Have you got a hand?
Give it to me man
Been with Ella James too long - alright!
Who's she gonna lose?
What's she gonna use now?
She was hasting to get me down
Will she ever pass to another class now?
And she's waiting to throw me down - alright!
Sweet little girls in the money
Now she don't wanna know me at all ooh ooh
Who's she gonna use?
What's he gonna lose?
Been with Ella James too long - alright!
Who's she gonna lose?
What's she gonna use now?
She was hasting to get me down
Will she ever pass to another class now?
And she's waiting to throw me down
Sweet little girl came a running to the door
When she told me he'd gone ooh ooh
I've just had a ball
Not too bad at all
Thank you Ella James so long, so longEmbed
