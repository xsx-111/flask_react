California Man LyricsGoing to a party, meet me out after school
Well, we're going to a place where the jive is really cool
And if the band stops playing there's a jukebox in the hall
Well, with your blue dress on and your folks all gone
You'll sure give the guys a ball
Get that real guitar boy shakin'
I'm a California man
Dance right on till the floors are breakin'
I'm a California man
Well I cross my mamma so bad
And this woman, she's making me mad
So I don't care if your legs start aching
I'm a California man
Oh my legs start to shiver when I hear you call my name
Well, my knees keep a-knocking and I'm feeling tired bugs me down
And when we take off fine and my jeans are way down low
When I waggle my hips it's making me feel
Like the king of rock 'n' roll
Get that real guitar boy shakin'
I'm a California man
Dance right on till the floors are breakin'
I'm a California man
Well I cross my mamma so bad
And this woman, she's making me mad
So I don't care if your legs start aching
I'm a California man
I'm a California man
Going to a party, meet me out after school
Well, we're going to a place where the jive is really cool
And if the band stops playing there's a jukebox in the hall
With your blue dress on and your folks all gone
You're sure to give the guys a ball
Get that real guitar boy shakin'
I'm a California man
Dance right on till the floors are breakin'
I'm a California man
Well I cross my mamma so bad
And this woman's just a-making me mad
So I don't care if your legs start aching
I'm a California man
I'm a California manEmbed
