Down on the Bay LyricsAh sweet little lady used to drive me crazy
Had to stick around to play
Down on the bay
Thats where I stay
The clouds are gray
Down on the bay
And thats my home
Can't leave my woman alone
Dont know what I'm missing
But I wouldn't miss the kissing
With lily cause she looks so fine
Down on the bay
Thats where I stay
The clouds are gray
Down on the bay
And thats my home
Can't leave my woman alone
Walking with my lily
Down a road thats pretty chilly
But she makes it like a summer day
Down on the bay
Thats where I stay
The clouds are gray
Down on the bay
And thats my home
Can't leave my woman alone
Sure look so delighted
And I'm getting so excited
Every time you start to play
Down on the bay
Down on the bay
Thats where I stay
A-sittin on the bay
Thats where I stay
Thats where I stay
Down on the bay
Thats where ill stay
Down on the...
Thats where I'll...Embed
