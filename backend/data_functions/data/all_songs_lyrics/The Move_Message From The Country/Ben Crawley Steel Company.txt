Ben Crawley Steel Company LyricsThe next train arrives on here at five o nine
I'm standing where my daddy used to be
To follow his footsteps takes me three stops down the line
Down to the Ben Crawley steel company
Well I tried my hand at ranching but this didn't come off
Seems nothing in that for me
It always tried my patience which I haven't enough
I'm destined to work in a steel company
Just you wait at home for me little woman
By now I should know how lovely you will be
Waiting by the door for me little woman
Now I won't moan when I get home from the Ben Crawley steel company
When Crawley makes the jokes and four guys laugh a lot
Damn, force a grin if you can
I got so many words on the tip of my tongue to shoot him down
But he'd soon replace a mere steel driving man
Just you wait at home for me little woman
Although I know you won't be as tired as me
Waiting by the door for me little woman (my true lovin' woman)
Well I won't slack when I get back from the Ben Crawley steel company
Well I've had my fill and it's giving me hell, now it's time for hate
Thanks mister for telling me
So I'll shoot if I can and I won't (don't) give a damn about playing it
Straight
My friends and the lord know what he's done (he did) to me
He's being staying at home with my little woman
Playing in the fields where I should always be
It's hard to forgive my own little woman
And to find a job 'cos I just blew up that steel company
Heh!Embed
