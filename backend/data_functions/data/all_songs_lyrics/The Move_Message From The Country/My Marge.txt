My Marge LyricsMy Marge is such a delight
She thrills me at night
The second I turn off the light
My Marge is peaches to me
When no one can see
The snuggle up is heavenly
My Marge squeeze me, squeeze me
Take me home for tea
Let's not stay out too late
'Cause your mother will be cross
And I'll be down across her knee, you know
My Marge speaks double Dutch
She's so ripe to touch
That's why I love her very much
O, three, three, O
And take me home for tea
Let's not stay out too late
'Cause your mother will be cross
And I'll be down across her knee, you know
You know my Marge is such a delight
She thrills me at night
The second I turn off the light
You know my Marge
She's a nice girl you know
She picks her nose
Throws the brown lumps over the right side
The green lumps over the left side
And everybody else says goodnightEmbed
