The Minister LyricsPlayed too hard and he died too young
To be certain of earning his burnt out love
He won a place in history
And his name will live eternally
Lived the life of a movie star
And he waved to the people from a big black car
Down in a book with the greatest names
As a lonely maid cried, "Take the pain"
Tell me a story, mister
There ain't no time left to lose
Ten man tried in the dead of night
But the great man's final words to right
In a room that was soft and red
The great man spoke outside my head
Tell me a story, mister
There ain't no time left to loseEmbed
