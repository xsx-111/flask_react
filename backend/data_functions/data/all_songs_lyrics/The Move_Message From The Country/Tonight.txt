Tonight LyricsThat's the road it's over there and leading down to nowhere
This is the age when you're allowed to have your own care
If you were half so bright you'd plan your life ahead
Instead of waiting 'til you're old in your bed
Chorus:
I'll be over tonight
If you say you might
I'll be over tonight
I need to put you right
I'm so used to waiting that's entirely your decision
Don't be restricted by the weightless views you're given
If you were half so bright you'd fight them from the head
Instead of saving 'til your young heart is dead
Chorus
Well the note you wrote in your overcoat
And you don't want to take it too far
Oh I think you won't but I know you don't
But you always say that you are
Never let the riches that my endless need will give you
Show some concern for all the love that you must live through
If you were half so bright you'd plan your life ahead
Instead of waiting 'til you're old in your bed
