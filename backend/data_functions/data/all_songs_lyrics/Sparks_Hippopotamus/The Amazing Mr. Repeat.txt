The Amazing Mr. Repeat LyricsDarnell, he doesn't stand a chance
Nor Johnny nor that guy from France
Nor Sammy or the paper boy
Nor Tony who they call Leroy
The girls are waiting, single file
They might be waiting there a while
It might be dawn, it might be noon
It might be, God forbid, next June
The Amazing Mr. Repeat
At your service again
Once more again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
He drives them crazy, drives them mad
His very own Olympiad
Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
There's ecstasy on every face
Of every girl in our whole place
The Amazing Mr. Repeat
At your service again
Once more again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
No waiting to reload at all
No waiting for that protocol
Once more again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
Sign here, son, that's right, the dotted line
The dotted line, you'll take the world by storm
He rejects them all every time, every time
Their exploitation's met with scorn
He's on the nightly news again
They have to have him after ten
So kids are all asleep and he
Can be talked about honestly
He feels they are using him
A circus freak not really him
So he stays in the neighborhood
Still, local girls say, “damn, he's good”
Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
The Amazing Mr. Repeat
At your service again
Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
The rest of us seem very slow
An intermission breaks the flow
Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
Sign here, son, that's right, the dotted line
The dotted line and all will turn out great
He rejects them all every time, every time
Every time, I'd really rather wait
The Amazing Mr. Repeat
At your service again
Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh noEmbed
