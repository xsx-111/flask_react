Giddy Giddy LyricsGiddy, giddy, giddy
Our entire city
Each and every person the epitome of giddiness
We're giddy, giddy, giddy
Our entire city
Everyone displaying an immense amount of giddiness
We're giddy, giddy, giddy
Our entire city
Each and every person the epitome of giddiness
We're giddy, giddy, giddy
Our entire city
Everyone displaying an immense amount of giddiness
And I'm a traveling man
In a foreign land
Often I suppress
My inherent giddiness
Until I'm finally home
Throw away the comb
Kick up both my heels
And resume my giddiness
(And I'll resume my giddiness)
We're giddy, giddy, giddy
Struttin' ‘round the city
How are you today?
“I'm feelin' pretty, pretty giddy
How are you?”
I'm pretty giddy
Last week was a pity
Had a touch of flu and felt a little less than giddy, giddy
Now I'm back to giddy
Couldn't feel more giddy
If my life depended on it
“Glad to know you're back to giddy”
Giddy, giddy, giddy
Our entire city
Each and every person the epitome of giddiness
Giddy, giddy wife
Flower of my life
Kids are all asleep
She is thinking giddiness
And so am, so am I
Sparkle in her eye
Both of us display
A little extra giddiness
A little extra giddiness
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
Giddy, giddy kids
Often blow their lids
Normally they're giddy but at times they're acting up
Had enough
Go to bed
‘Til you're giddy
‘Til you're giddy, real giddy
From another city
Where nobody's giddy
Comes a scientific group to analyze our giddiness
“Their water ain't too giddy
Their diet ain't too giddy
We're prettier than they are but they're infinitely giddier”
Giddy, giddy, giddy
Their entire city
Each and every person the epitome of giddiness
They're giddy, giddy, giddy
Their entire city
Everyone displaying an immense amount of giddiness
We conclude their town
Never, never's down
Endorphin's really flow
Why it is, don't really know
We need a bigger grant
Thus we're hesitant
Honestly, no clue
Why they're so damn giddy, giddy
Giddy, giddy, giddy
Their entire city
Each and every person the epitome of giddiness
They're giddy, giddy, giddy
Their entire city
Everyone displaying an immense amount of giddiness
Giddy, giddy, giddy
They show mucho giddiness
Giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy
Giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddyEmbed
