What the Hell Is It This Time? LyricsHistorically, historically, we make an appeal
To something greater than we are when we need to heal
But don't concern Him with your little Band-Aid affair
His temper will flare, he'll rise from his chair
What the hell is it this time?
My God is great, my God is good, he loves every man
But show consideration when you pray in demands
His plate is filled with famine and with clean, wholesome air
If Arsenal wins, he really don't care
What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?
You've asked Him for redemption twenty times in the past
And twenty times he's granted it and again you have asked
But twenty is the limit and he's now getting peeved
And when He gets peeved, it's not to be believed
What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?
My God is great, my God is good, he loves every man
He loves every man, he loves every man
My God is great, my God is good, but show some restraint
If you're feeling faint, appeal to a saint
What the hell is it this time?
It's you again, it's you again, you get on my nerves
What the hell is it this time?
I've billions to serve, you get on my nerves
What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?
My girl has left, my dog has left, I've cracked up my car
The only one who will listen to me's tending the bar
He turns his back and walks away and I say, “hey you
I ain't hardly through”, he says, “yeah, you're through”
Our God is great, our God is good, he loves every man
But there's a limit to what even he can withstand
So be selective in what you slip under his door
If it isn't war, it may be ignored
What the hell is it this time?
My God is great, my God is good but don't waste His time
What the hell is it this time
He's dealing with crime, so don't waste His time
What the hell is it this time?
Historically, historically, we think we've carte blanche
What the hell is it this time
He don't take carte blanche
He don't take carte blanche
What the hell is it this time?
