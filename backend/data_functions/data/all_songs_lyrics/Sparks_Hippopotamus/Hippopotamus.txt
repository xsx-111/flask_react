Hippopotamus LyricsThere's a hippopotamus, a hippopotamus, a hippopotamus in my pool
There's a hippopotamus, a hippopotamus, a hippopotamus in my pool
How did it get there, how did it get there, how did it get there?
I don't know
How did it get there, how did it get there, how did it get there?
I don't know
There's a book by Anonymous, a book by Anonymous, a book by Anonymous in my pool
There's a book by Anonymous, a book by Anonymous, and a hippopotamus in my pool
No, I've not read it, no, I've not read it
When it dries out I'll have a go
How did it get there, how did it get there, how did it get there?
I don't know
Someone must have been fooling around
Someone must have been acting the clown
Someone must have been taking the piss
Taking the piss in acting like this
There's a painting by Hieronymous Bosch, by Hieronymous Bosch, by Hieronymous in my pool
There's a painting by Hieronymous Bosch, by Hieronymous Bosch, by Hieronymous in my pool
How did it get there, how did it get there, how did it get there?
Sure beats me
Must be a late work, must be a late work, one of his late works
Obviously!
There's a Volkswagen Microbus, a Volkswagen Microbus, a Volkswagen Microbus in my pool
A '58 Microbus, a '58 Microbus, a '58 Microbus in my pool
A hippy is driving, a hippy is driving
A drippy ol' hippy, poor, poor guy
A hippy is driving, a hippy is driving
I throw him a towel, here go get dry
Someone must have been acting real cute
Someone  wearing a slim-fitty suit
Someone must have thought, oh, what a laugh
Throw in a hippo and then a giraffe
There is Titus Andronicus, Titus Andronicus, Titus Andronicus in my pool
There is Titus Andronicus, Titus Andronicus wearing a snorkel in my pool
Now he's gone under, now he's gone under, now he's gone under
Worry not
Excellent swimmer, excellent swimmer
Looking much trimmer than I'd thought
There's a woman with an abacus, a woman with an abacus, a woman with an abacus, she looks Chinese
There's a woman with an abacus, a woman with an abacus, a woman with an abacus, she looks Chinese
Not that I'm prejudiced, not that I'm prejudiced, not that I'm prejudiced
No not me
Not that I'm prejudiced, not that I'm prejudiced, not that I'm prejudiced
That's not me
Throw in a hippo, a little Dutch art
An actor performing a Shakespearean part
Summery book and Germanic van
Asian lady, isn't it grand?
Yes, yes, so grandEmbed
