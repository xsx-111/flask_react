Probably Nothing LyricsSomething to tell you, but now I forget
Probably nothing
Some little story, no, nothing, not yet
Probably nothing
Don't try to think of it then it'll come
Happens a lot lately, I feel so dumb
It'll come when it comes, but I still feel so dumb
Something to tell you, but now I forget
Probably nothing
Let's just forget it, the sun's gonna set
I'm sure it was nothing
Why are looking at me in that way?
What was it that you thought I would now say?
Mild disappointment shown now in the way
That you walk away, you walk awayEmbed
