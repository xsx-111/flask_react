Scandinavian Design LyricsI've got nothing, just a table and two chairs
But they're beautiful and I just stand and stare
Time and space intertwined
Elegance, simple lines, Scandinavian Design
I've got nothing, just a table and two chairs
But I know that everything
I need is there
Every line, every shape
Sculptural, no escape
It's Scandinavian Design
Sometimes she comes over, I think I know why
Says the sky has bored her, what's wrong with the sky
Who am I to turn her out, all that she thinks about
Is Scandinavian Design
She stayed over, and we slept on wooden floors
She gets up at 8 and tiptoes to the door
She turns â€˜round, subtle wave
Hums a tune by Sam and Dave
Scandinavian Design
Every line, every shape
Sculptural, no escape
Scandinavian Design
I've got nothing, just a table and two chairs
But they're beautiful and I just stand and stare
Time and space are intertwined
I can see this defined
Scandinavian Design
Most times she won't come but I don't really mind
Has a job to do as some guy's concubine
Chandeliers, bric-a-brac
I know that she'll be back
Scandinavian Design
Every line, every shape
Sculptural, no escape
Scandinavian Design
Time and space intertwined
Elegance, simple lines
Scandinavian DesignEmbed
