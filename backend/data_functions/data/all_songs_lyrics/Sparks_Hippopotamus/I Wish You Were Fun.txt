I Wish You Were Fun LyricsI wish you were fun
I wish you were fun in every way
I wish you were fun
To brighten the dark cold winter day
In every other way I find you amazing but one
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun to be around
I wish you were fun
You say that your favorite color's brown
In every other way I find you amazing but one
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun
No one ever changes, why even bring it up?
You'll only muck it up, she'll never yuck it up
You know she's from somewhere where
Authority ruled supreme, no would ever dream
Dream of just letting off some steam
I wish you were fun
You've got it all covered â€˜cept for that
I love how you run
With such a determined look at that
I shouldn't let it faze me at all but I'm just plain old dumb
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun
La la la la
La la la la la la la la la
No one ever changes, why even mention it?
Calling attention it leads to the tension
That's not helpful, back off and accept what you have in hand
Glad that she's no Ayn Rand, humorless to the Nth degree
La la la la la
I wish you were fun
La la la la la la la la la
Fun in every way
La la la la la
I wish you were fun
La la la la
Have some Chardonnay
In every other way
I find you amazing but one
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun
And maybe you're fun in subtle ways
Too subtle for me, but maybe I'll get it all one day
But how about a somersault until you are blatantly fun
Do that, I'd be stunned
I wish you were fun
La la la la
In every other way
I find you amazing but one
I wish you were fun
I wish you were funEmbed
