So Tell Me Mrs. Lincoln Aside from That How Was the Play? LyricsOnly the subtext, never the text
Wish I could push a button for next
Only the surface, never the heart
When will the confab finally start?
Nodding my head like a bobblehead doll
Trying to smile, ignoring it all
Don't interrupt, you'll just cause a fuss
Hope I can catch the 10 o'clock bus
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was the play?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was your day?
Only the warmup, still not the game
Every time exactly the same
Try to drop hints, a glance at my watch
A glance at my watch, while we slip a notch
Why is the subject so hard to broach
Must be a talent so hard to coach
Stalling without strategic intent
What should I try to give up for Lent?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was the play?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was your day?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was the play?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was your day?
Putting all of that aside
Putting all of that aside
Putting all of that aside
Putting all of that aside
Putting all of that aside
What lies underneath it all?
What lies underneath it all?
What lies underneath it all?
What lies underneath it all?
Wandering mind, meandering words
I couldn't tell you any I've heard
For the last hour, hour or two
Now I retie the lace on my shoe
Is this a breakup or is it not?
All I can tell you, man, I am shot
Don't interrupt, you'll just cause a fuss
Looks like I missed the 10 o'clock bus
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was the play?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was your day?
What lies underneath, ignored?Embed
