Bummer LyricsDearly departed we
Gather here solemnly
To describe how we feel ‘bout your suddenly passing
Stories of deeds that touch
Seem like a bit too much
Then they point to me hoping for thoughts everlasting
Never, never, never know
(You) Never, never, never know
Never, never, never know
(You) never, never, never know
Never, never, never know
Bummer
All of them prattle on
Even your widow yawns
You deserve something more, but they go through the motions
They have seen on TV
People of majesty who can sum up a life with a phrase
They don't know you
It's a bummer, it's a bummer, what a bummer
Bummer
We had eyes on the same
Stunning thing, both insane
All the time, I could see
It was you
Rest in peace
Bummer, bummer, bummer
Bummer
We had the best of times, all of those petty crimes
It all had to end with your vows to be tasteful
What I said angrily
I should have kept to me
What I said to you both it was primetime disgraceful
It's a bummer, it's a bummer
What a bummer, what a bummer
It's a bummer, it's a bummer
What a bummer, what a bummer
Quoting a Shakespeare line
Citing the Bible I'm not sure that that fits, anyway I am lazy
Don't worry, I will not try hitting on her, you're fine
I respect you enough, though she still drives me crazy
It's a bummer, it's a bummer, what a bummer
Bummer
Some ol' fool says, “life goes on”
She is crushed that you're gone
Just a word says it all
Just a word, you hit that wall
Never, never, never know
(You) Never, never, never know
Never, never, never know
(You) never, never, never know
Never, never, never know
(You) never, never, never know
It's a bummer, it's a bummer
What a bummer, what a bummer
It's a bummer, it's a bummer
What a bummer
BummerEmbed
