Unaware LyricsDragonflies too tired to breed
CEO too tired to lead
Home town wins more times than not
Bow-tied man is maladroit
She's unaware, unaware
Photos of distant star
There it is, here we are
Someone tells off-color joke
Heimlich saves man who chokes
She's unaware, unaware
She's unaware, unaware
Taylor Swift has something new
Nike has a brand new shoe
Reads your heart rate, anywhere
She don't know, she don't care
She's unaware, unaware
Class walks out on lecturer
Actress wears real fur
Headline act disappoints
Coral bleached off the point
She's unaware, unaware
She's unaware, unaware
Her parents stare down
Faces like two clowns
That's all she knows of, that's all
Wish I could warn her
Don't turn that corner
Stay unaware of it all
Apparitions everywhere
Silent couples sit and stare
Someone promised, didn't show
Someone says, “Have to go”
She's unaware, unaware
Apparitions everywhere
Silent couples sit and stare
Someone promised, didn't show
Someone says, “Have to go”
She's unaware, unawareEmbed
