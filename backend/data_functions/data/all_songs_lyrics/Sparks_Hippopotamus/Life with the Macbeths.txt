Life with the Macbeths LyricsAll the dreaming and scheming and playing games
Are enough to draw millions each week the same
Same station, same time, new feuds
While a rating of “R” may be generous
All that blood and ambition so onerous
Our public, the public, enthused
Life With The Macbeths is now on view
As the cameras are rolling, we roll our eyes
But our lifestyle demands that we hide our sighs
One season, that's all you'll see
As the Lady inspires me to depths unseen
Killing all in my way, some will yell “obscene”
The ratings are off the charts
Life With The Macbeths, both tart and smart
Our public, the public, enthused
Ambition leads to murder
A royal reign of terror
The critics split in fervor
Some not that into murder
Is there a deeper story?
Or is it only gory?
Strong woman prods her husband
And then regrets what's coming
Are we both to survive, well, you'll have to wait
Maybe yes, maybe no, what we can, though, state
Each murder, the ratings soar
Life With The Macbeths is sure to score
Life With The Macbeths is sure to scoreEmbed
