Missionary Position LyricsIt's a little retro and a bit passé
But you know you make her feel A-OK
And she feels alright, the stars are bright, the missionary position
And the acrobats, well, they tend to scoff
All you know is that you can get her off
And you feel alright, the stars are bright, the missionary position
The tried and true is good enough for me and you, for me and you
The tried and true is good enough
Don't need anymore, we don't need anymore
A rebranding effort might just be the thing
But a name's a name, and we're continuing
Always feeling fine, it ain't the wine, it's the missionary position
There are pros and cons to each different pose
But we don't see any need to get to those
‘Cause we're feeling great, a heightened state, the missionary position
The tried and true is good enough for me and you, for me and you
The tried and true is good enough
Don't need anymore, we don't need anymore
Don't need anymore, we don't need anymore
You might have positions you can recommend
But I don't know if we'll ever get to them
‘Cause we feel alright, the stars are bright, the missionary position
You might pride yourself, you're so avant-garde
But we're neoclassicists, I guess, at heart
Patronize all you like, we both like the missionary position
Missionary, missionary, missionary, missionary
Missionary, missionary, missionary, missionary
Missionary, missionary, missionary, missionary
Missionary, missionary, missionary, missionary
It's a private matter as to frequency
But we both are smiling as you well can see
And it ain't no joke, it ain't baroque, it's the missionary position
It's a little retro and a bit passé
But you know you make her feel A-OK
And she feels alright, the stars are bright, the missionary positionEmbed
