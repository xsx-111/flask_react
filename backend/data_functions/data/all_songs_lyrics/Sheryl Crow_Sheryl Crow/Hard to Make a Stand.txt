Hard to Make a Stand Lyrics
Old James Dean Monroe
Hands out flowers at the Shop-N-Go
Hopes for money but all he gets is fear
And the wind blows up his coat
And this he scribbles on a perfume note
"If I'm not here, then you're not here"
And he says, "Call me Miss Creation
I'm a walking celebration"

It's hard to make a stand (yeah)
And it's hard to make a stand (oh)
Yeah, it's hard to make a stand

My friend, oh Lordy
Went to take care of her own body
She got shot down in the road
She looked up before she went
Said, "This isn't really what I meant"
And the daily news said, "Two with one stone"
And I said, "Hey there, Miscreation
Bring a flower, time is wasting"

It's hard to make a stand
And it's hard to make a stand
And it's hard to make a stand
Oh, it's hard to make a stand
Yes it is!
We got loud guitars and big suspicions
Great big guns and small ambitions
And we still argue over who is God
And I say, "Hey there, Miss Creation
Bring a flower, time is wasting"
I say, "Hey there, Miss Creation
We all need a celebration"

It's hard to make a stand (yeah)
And it's hard to make a stand
Oh, it's hard to make a stand (oh)
Yeah, it's hard to make a stand
Oh, I think it's hard to make a stand (okay)Embed
