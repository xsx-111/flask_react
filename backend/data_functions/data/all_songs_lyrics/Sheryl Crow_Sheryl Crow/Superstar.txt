Superstar Lyrics
Let's all go downtown
I got friends doing nothing but hanging around...well
I feel like there's something I could be missing
You know you look alright
You got cheap shoes, a Malibu, and big public fights
Well, there's no one else I would rather be kissing

Baby, when you start to bleed, you look so sweet
Everybody's watching you cause everybody wants to be
Little superstar, well baby, that's what you are
Little superstar, oh honey, that's what you are

I got a backstage line
I call you up, been watching you for quite some time
I beat around the streets like
Bandini looking for Camilla
I'll be satin and speed
If you and I are still alive
We'll get off these streets
Well, there was a time I would have
Hung around just to be seen
Hey man, it's a shame when you start to fade
Diamond rings and sparkly things
Won't make your shine stay
Baby, when you start to bleed, you look so sweet
Everybody's watching you cause everybody wants to be
Little superstar, well baby, that's what you are
Little superstar, oh honey, that's what you areEmbed
