Maybe Angels Lyrics
Six-lane highway running up to my back door
But it won't take me where I want to be
I took the I-95 down to Pensacola
All I found was a bunch of holy rollers
The don't know nothing about saving me

I swear they're out there
I swear, I swear they're out there
I swear, I swear they're out there
I swear, maybe angels, maybe angels

Down here I feel like a citizen of nowhere
My bag's all packed in case they ever come for me
Got a hundred stories and tabloid lies
Got witnesses to what the government denies
So I'm headed down to Roswell to wait and see

I swear they're out there
I swear, I swear they're out there
I swear, I swear they're out there
I swear, maybe angels, maybe angels
Oh what a mystery
Oh, I believe, I believe, I could leave

My sister, she says she knows Elvis
She knows Jesus, John Lennon, and Cobain personally
Well, but I'm too wise to believe my eyes
Cause all I've seen just terrifies me
But I believe they're coming back for me

I swear they're out there
I swear, I swear they're out there
I swear, I swear they're out there
I swear, maybe angels, maybe angelsEmbed
