Sad Sad World Lyrics
I know you hate me, I see that now
If I was unhappy I'd be someone you could still care about
I think it's stupid and sad that everything turned out so bad
And enemies make the most interesting friends
I'm gonna write you a long letter
I'm gonna get you on a telephone
Three little words to make it all better
Maybe I'll leave this whole thing alone

It's a sad sad world without you in it
And I'm a bad bad girl for letting you down
And I remember every crazy minute
Oh, it's a sad sad world with out you around

We're to much alike for our own good
We both hate fighting no matter how misunderstood
But I wanna tell you that you're stubborn
I wanna tell you I never lied
And I wanna tell you that your friends talk way too much
And I wanna know what happened to that friend of mine

It's a sad sad world without you in it
And I was a bad bad girl for letting you down
And I remember every crazy minute
Oh, it's a sad sad world without you around
Oh, it's a sad sad world without you in it
And I'm a bad bad girl for letting you down
I remember every fucked up minute
Oh, it's a sad sad world without you aroundEmbed
