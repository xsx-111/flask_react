Free Man LyricsI sold my house, I sold my car
I took a job at Milly's bar
I met a man who was running from the government
Ah he wants to be a free man yeah
Ah he wants to be a free man yeah
He took me out to his campsite
I met his friends
They seemed alright
Until I noticed everybody seemed real upright
They just wanna be a free man now
They just wanna be a free man now
They just wanna be a free man now
Pardon me man
Oh but who's your mother
Oh and didn't she say
You should love one another
He showed me how to load a piece
To shoot it straight between the teeth
And the next thing I know I think I've fallen in love
And I'm living with a free man now
Now I'm cooking for the free man now
He took me out in his old truck
He told me anyone who ain't white sucks
That's when I realized I'd made a big mistake
Oh I'm running from the free man now
Oh I'm running from the free man now
Oh I'm running from the free man now Oh but pardon me man
Oh who's your mother
And didn't she teach you
She should love one another
Late one night I snuck away
To use the phone so I could say
I'd appreciate a little bit of government
Cause I'm married to a free man now
Oh I'm married to a free man now
Yeah I'm married to a free man now
Well I'm married to a free man now
Yeah I'm married to a free man now
Oh I'm married to a free man now
I think I'm running from a free man
Running from a free man
Running from a free man now
Oh I'm running from a free man now
Oh I'm running from a free man nowEmbed
