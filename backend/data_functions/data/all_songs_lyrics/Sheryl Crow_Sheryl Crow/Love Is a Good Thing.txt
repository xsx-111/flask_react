Love Is a Good Thing Lyrics
Watch out sister, watch out brother
Watch our children while they kill each other
With a gun they bought at Wal-mart discount stores
Welcome to the hallway, metal detectors just been installed
Hey isn't cops and robbers gettin' to be a big bore?
Mary, Mary quite contrary, close the door now
It's much too scary
And your might see something you wish you hadn't seen
Out of sight, out of time, out of patience
And I'm out of my mind
Governor, tell me what does it mean?
Dance children, dance to the beat
Wanna be a hippy cause life is so sweet
Good morning hate
Dance children, dance to the beat
Wanna rock and roll up and down the street
I've got a message

Love is a good thing
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good thing

Politicians on a mission
Build them up, bring them down
For the good of the system
Well we don't like the way you live your life
I got one thing I must express
We try our criminals in the press
Justice is a fading light
Mary, Mary quite contrary, close the door now
It's much too scary
And you might see something you wish you hadn't seen
Out of sight, out of time, out of patience
And I'm out of my mind
Governor, tell me what does it mean
Dance children, dance to the beat
Wanna be a hippy cause life is so sweet
Good morning hate
Dance children, dance to the beat
Wanna rock and roll up and down the street
I've got a message
Love is a good thing
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good thing

Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love1Embed
