Another World LyricsHead wrapped in your hair
In a box lined with silk
You can't learn to talk
And the air is your milk
Erasing my face
I want you so bad
I want to be you
It's futile it's sad
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh oh oh
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
Muscle against silk
Tears fall from the burn
A smell of perfume
In a moment you'll turn
In a moment you'll turn
Your face will change shape
We exchange just one gift:
To see like an ape
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh oh oh
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
Not this one
Oh so easy to go
Drawn in the vacuum
At the time I'm in you
I'm alone in the back room
Down to the last raw
My eyes open wide
To collect all the scraps
Ten more years and they'll cry
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh oh oh
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another worldEmbed
