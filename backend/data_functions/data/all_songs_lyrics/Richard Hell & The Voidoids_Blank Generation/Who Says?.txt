Who Says? LyricsI saw what I had so
I got I got mad so
I guess I went bad so
Now I search for new endeavors
Push my buttons wear my levers
Who says it's good to good to be alive
Same ones who keep it a perpetual jive
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
It ain't no good, it's a perpetual dive
There's nothing to win by
This sort of an outcry
Oh yeah, we all know why
'cause the world a person lives in is his brain
Well, mine just gives in
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
Same ones who keep it a perpetual jive
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
It ain't no good it's a perpetual dive
It's clear that I choose to
Live on I'm so used to...
But still it ain't news to ditch it
Say when one incentive's gained and gone
Though you're inventive
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
Same ones who keep it a perpetual jive
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
It ain't no good it's a perpetual dive
Once born you're addicted
And so you depict it
As good, but who kicked it?
Users just can't see the horror
Tell one if you want to bore her
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
Same ones who keep it a perpetual jive
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
It ain't no good it's a perpetual dive1Embed
