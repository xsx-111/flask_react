Betrayal Takes Two LyricsBetrayal takes two. Who did it to who?
I mean: not to be cut by your dull point of view
Feelings will change - we're helpless they must
We like it that way - eliminates trust
But that cut on your arm where the blood is still fresh
And the thought of some harm that comes to yourself...
Hey sweetheart cool off, you're not so distraught...
You lost what you had but that's what I've got
I'll close my eyes while you take off my clothes
No wait a while till this feelings goes...
The feeling gets stronger, two times emptiness-
We'll embrace that much longer, make more of a mess...
The senstation of life was aroused in ourself
From the plot we digressed, knocked the books off the shelves
Then burned down the house, then met in a bar
With a motel attached and kissed all the scars
We're changed now for good, but I try to insert
My face to appear when you love when you flirt...Embed
