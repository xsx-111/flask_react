Down at the Rock and Roll Club LyricsPartner don you pull no gun/Down at the rock and roll club
We just gonna have some fun/Down at the rock and roll club
Sweetheart would you buy me one/Down at the rock and roll club
They say Richard are you gonna go out tonite?
Well I am uncetain I ain't feelin too right
But i rip up my shirt/Watch the mirror it flirt
Yeah, I'm goin out, out, inta sight
Partner don you pull no gun/Down at the rock and roll club
We just gonna have some fun/Down at the rock and roll club
Sweetheart would you buy me one/Down at the rock and roll club
On the street air is thin, dim night like the rest
At the door of the club loungin eyes so undressed
Then you open the door/and the noise shakes the floor
Oh baby night after night here tonight is the best
Partner don you pull no gun/Down at the rock and roll club
We just gonna have some fun/Down at the rock and roll club
Sweetheart would you buy me one/Down at the rock and roll club
I say Hey how's the group, when's the set gonna start?
She says I know that girl - there's a tattoo on her heart
She pivots in rage/and the band hits the stage
Sexy love ricochets round everyone's part
Partner don you pull no gun/Down at the rock and roll club
We just gonna have some fun/Down at the rock and roll club
Sweetheart would you buy me one/Down at the rock and roll club
I say everybody's waitin - I want moments like these
Oh baby get me drunk I'll go to my knees/
Such a surge overload/Oh the whold joint explode
Everyone you ever saw indulgin in squeeze
Partner don you pull no gun/Down at the rock and roll club
We just gonna have some fun/Down at the rock and roll club
Sweetheart would you buy me one/Down at the rock and roll clubEmbed
