The Plan LyricsI withdrew from the street and all humanlike zones
I'd had it, I'd had it - I was mush to the bones
I covered the windows, I was taking no calls
Then I thought for a month inside the alien walls
Now I know oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know, oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know. Oh
They don't tell you so
But I can recall it all
I called up a girl I'd known for so many years
I'd seen her in shock, I'd seen the last of her tears
I admired her style from her toes to her brain -
She accepted my plan and so she caught the next train
Now I know oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know, oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know. Oh
They don't tell you so
But I can recall it all
We would secretly smile inside our surgical masks
But we were serious too - we accomplished our task
The schedule was followed, a daughter was born
And so the mother departed - I was left with her form
Now I know oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know, oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know. Oh
They don't tell you so
But I can recall it all
Her education's begun - I'm intent on success
Her breathtaking beauty it brings out my best
I once knew true love - she won't know another
Life is renewed, my little girl is my lover
Now I know oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know, oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know. Oh
They don't tell you so
But I can recall it allEmbed
