Walking on the Water LyricsLate last night, I went for a walk
Down by the river near my home
Couldn't believe with my own eyes
And I swear I'll never leave my home again
I saw a man walking on the water
Coming right at me from the other side
Calling out my name, "Do not be afraid"
Feet begin to run, pounding in my brain
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go
No, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna go1Embed
