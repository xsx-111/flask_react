Where the Twain Shall Meet LyricsAlright now
Push against the wooden table
A sliver cut and no trace of pain
I lose it's image as it blurs away
I feel the rope as it slowly frays
You never know where the twain shall meet
You never know which one stays
Keep aware of the trap that snares
Which one stays?
Statue people move like dripping water
Hit's a nail into the cracking ice
I sleep with thoughts of the coming day
I drag behind on a frozen chain
You never know where the twain shall meet
You never know which one stays
Keep aware of the trap that snares
Which one stays? Which one stays?
So I'm down
But I don't know what way I'm going
So very long
And it doesn't matter where this has gone
Slide a coin into the magic light machine
Watch a story that is never free
Takes it toll on you, energy-wise
Keeps you alone nearly all the time
You never know where the twain shall meet
You never know which one stays
Keep aware of the trap that snares
You're never gonna know which one stays
Which one stays?
Which one stays?Embed
