Revelation Revolution LyricsYeah...
Come down with me
I got a time machine
Held between my fingers
Know now your head is low
So hear me as the smoke still lingers
Restless lights creeping in
Your body splits in two again
It's easy when you're finding that
Stars don't sparkle where you're at
Tomorrow comes too late held back
It's a revelation revolution
Residing in a land that's either far away
Or near to my eyes
Life is like a deal with someone
Telling fibs that fall from blue skies
Back into the darkest cell
Light will come soon, you can't tell
Light is fading fast this time
It's a revelation revolution
Come down with and see this time machine
Held between my fingers
Confused and unused
Landing heavy as the smoke still lingers
Anxious sounds creeping in
Your soul splits in two again
It's easy when you're finding that
Stars don't sparkle where you're at
Tomorrow comes too late held back
It's a revelation revolution
It's a revelation revolution
It's a revelation revolution
Yeah, yeah
