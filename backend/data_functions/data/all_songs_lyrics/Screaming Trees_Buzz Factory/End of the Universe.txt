End of the Universe LyricsIt's a one-way ride to the end of the universe
Please leave your mind at the back of the plane
Golden dreams that you can't imagine
Never awaits you inside your brain chill today
Ten million miles behind you will find
Orange circles of a southern sunrise
Reflected through a blackened haze
Clocks are stopping behind the clouds
Appearing only to your gaze
Timeless echoes of green
With shifting seas in silhouette
Sudden flash of the brightest sun
And it hasn't even happened yet
It's a one-way ride to the end of the universe
Please say goodbye to the back of the plane
There'll be screams like you can't imagine
Never awaits you inside your brain chill today
Ten million miles behind you will find
Run around your sun god
And I'll paint you all in time
Catch baby dinosaurs and see how well they ride
There are wonders you have seen
With your lover and yourself
Greeted by obscenities like a working chosen elf
It's a one-way ride to the end of the universe
Please say goodbye to the back of the plane
Golden dreams that you can't imagine
Never awaits you inside your brain chill today
Ten million miles behind
You will find
Orange circles of a southern sunrise
Reflecting through a blackened haze
Clocks are stopping behind the clouds
Appearing only to your gaze
Timeless echoes of green
With shifting seas in silhouette
Sudden flash of the brightest sun
And it hasn't even started yet
It's a one-way ride to the end of the universe
Please say goodbye to the back of the plane
There'll be screams like you can't imagine
Never awaits you in side your brain chill today
Ten million miles behind
You will find
What you will findEmbed
