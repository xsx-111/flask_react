Too Far Away LyricsI sit alone in discontent
Your ears don't hear what I say
After a while you disconnect
To set you apart from pain
I walked past you all your life
But there is only one place
Next to you where I decide
In the presence of grace
Hide your eyes from what is real
And you don't know what I'll do
The planets locked in all these drawers
But only one holds the clue
Watch for people coming through
They don't know where I stand
One foot is by your side
And one in another land
I been down so many roads
As a child too far away
I've been down so many roads
I was travelling too far away, I say
I returned from miles away
To find that I didn't know you
I would go where the river flows
If I were able to
But I walk by you once again
There is only one place
Next to you where I decide
In the presence of your grace
I've been down so many roads
As a child too far away
I've been down so many roads
I was travelling too far away
I been down so many roads
I was travelling too far away
Ba, ba, ba, ba, aahEmbed
