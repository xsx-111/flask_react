Black Sun Morning LyricsWhen the daylight shines
I'm gonna see your face
Ah, yeah, yeah
Can we go back
To the moments that we held before
Now I'm moving inside
To the place behind the door
You said, so it seems
This time you wait
Drag me to the hazy shadow
I will never scream
Argh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now you can do it
Don't let it slip right through
Don't let the maddest people
Pick a part of you
Walk away in the dark
Too much praying
Too strange to see
Come down to my house, baby
There's things you won't believe
Black sun morning
Coming up to greet the dawn
Black sun morning
Coming up to greet us all
To greet us all
I seen a ghost heading for your life
I feel her burning me
In the back of my eyes
And I see it all the time
Because it's scaring me this time
As we step from day to night
Should I stay or should I...?
Black sun morning
Coming up to greet the dawn
Black sun morning
Coming up to greet us all
To greet us all, woah...
I can see her eyes
On my mind
Shouting out
I'm left out
All let down
I feel it slipping through my fingers
I feel it slipping away, away, away
Woah...
Black sun morning
Coming up to greet the dawn
Black sun morning
Coming up to greet us all
Black sun morning
Coming up to greet the dawn
Black sun morning
Coming up to greet us all
Black sun morning
Coming up to greet the dawn
Black sun morning
Coming up
Ow, Ow, Ow1Embed
