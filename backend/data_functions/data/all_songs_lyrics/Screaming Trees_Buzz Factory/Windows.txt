Windows LyricsYeah...
Oh, If you count every word I say
Over again you might find a way
Seven verses to magnify
Drop the feather for you will never fly
Tapestries of black and gold are crying
Looking through the windows
I am watching you as you go by
Down a wave of fire
Your pale skin can't turn any whiter
Grant a wish, sing a bitter tune
Never stops to forget you've seen
Tapestries of black and gold are crying
Looking through the windows
I am watching you as you go by
Walk along a lonely mile
Saw a bird falling at my feet
Crawling like a wounded child
Moving farther out of reach
I want to be alone now
Come on, come on, come on, hey
If you count every word I say
Over again you could find a way
Seven verses that magnify
Drop the feather for you will never fly
Tapestries of black and gold are crying
Looking through the windows
I am watching you as you go byEmbed
