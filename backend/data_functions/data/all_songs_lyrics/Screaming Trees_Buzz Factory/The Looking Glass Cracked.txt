The Looking Glass Cracked LyricsWalking down a different kind of plain
Are you really in this
Not at all
Said I'd never go
Why don't you close your eyes now
The yellow moon could never reach the corner
A looking glass cracked
Stumble past the doors that lead beyond
Beyond the mirror
Behind my back now you will disappear
Do you feel
Can you reach my hand
Or do you just believe there's
Nothing more to ask
But always wanted to turn your mind off
Stumble past the doors that lead beyond
Beyond the mirror
Never really going anywhere but here
Behind my back now you will disappear
Yep...
Walking down a different kind of plain
Are you really in this
Not at all
Said I'd never go
Why don't you close your eyes now
The yellow moon could never reach the corner
A looking glass cracked
Stumble past the doors that lead beyond
Beyond the mirror
Never really going anywhere but here
The yellow moon is rising, it's getting clear
Behind my back now you will disappear
Yep....Embed
