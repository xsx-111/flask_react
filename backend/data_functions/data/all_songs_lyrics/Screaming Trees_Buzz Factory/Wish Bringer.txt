Wish Bringer LyricsYeah, come on, dream
If you're lonely look into yourself
And find the time to do what's passed
Picture in the hole behind the canvases
Scenes of like you've never witnessed
Step out of your private circle
The gazing eyes will feel so cold
When blackness covers all you want to know
Face's turning in upon itself
Climbing up and falling down from above
It's you I want to give my love
From colours bending we will see
Reflected past come back to me
Tell me if you have to be
Your faces turning in upon themselves
Climbing up and falling down from above
It's you I want to give my love
Ow, I see you
If you're lonely look into yourself
And find the time, the fear is passed
Picture in the hole behind the canvases
Scenes of like you've never witnessed
Climbing up and falling down from above
It's you I want to give my love
It's you I want to give my love
Yeah
My love (x10)Embed
