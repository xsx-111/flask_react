Subtle Poison LyricsAlright
Yeah, yeah
Your subtle poison slips through my veins
The dark cloud inside of me
It hovers slow till you finally know
I'm waiting just to set it free
Well, the walls are closing in right on you
What are you gonna do now
The walls are closing in right on you
What did you think I would do now, hey
Well, come on
What I want it still evades me
A black fog behind me
A figure looming over my shoulder
Pushing me so very near
Now, the walls are closing in right on you
What are you gonna do now
The walls are closing in right on you
What did you think I would do now
Hey, they're closing in right on you
Yeah
Alright, yeah
Your subtle poison slips through my veins
A dark cloud inside of me
It hovers slow till you finally know
I'm waiting just to set it free
Well, the walls are closing in right on you
What are you gonna do now
The walls are closing in right on you
What did you think I would do now
The walls are closing in right on you
What did you think I would do now
The walls are closing in right on you
What are you gonna do now
Yeah
They're closing in right on you
They're closing in right on you
Closing in right on you
In right on you
Closing in right on you
Closing in right on you
Closing in right on youEmbed
