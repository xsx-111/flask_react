Red at Night LyricsI was born in a town where the rivers flow free
On a January night when the cold winds freeze
I got an Irish name and an injury
A blessing and a curse cast down on me
Ain't nobody got the blues like me
Ain't nobody got the blues like me
It was a blood red sky on the morning tide
There was a cold wind blowin' when I left that night
And the warning bells rang, all right, all right
Shoulda stayed home with you that night
Ain't nobody played the fool like I
Ain't nobody played the fool like I
Things got bad and things got worse
Half like a blessing, half like a curse
Seems a blessing's so hard to see sometimes
Got a little clearer 'bout dusk last night
Ain't nobody got a blessing like mine
Ain't nobody got a blessing like mine
It's a red sky night and I'm doin' all right
Red sky night and I'm doin' just fineEmbed
