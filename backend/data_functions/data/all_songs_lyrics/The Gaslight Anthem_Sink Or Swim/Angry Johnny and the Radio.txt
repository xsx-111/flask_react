Angry Johnny and the Radio LyricsDon't think twice
I still believe it, John, we lived those nights
Like we were dyin' on the long haul drives
For our Maria, with the ragged sails high
And the radio on
And I always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
84 takes a lifetime, but Bobby does it better
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
And I'm still here singin', thinkin' 'bout the government
In my old man's shoes, and how you'd understand that
Are you hidin' in a basement mixin' up the medicine?
Every April Fools' I say your name
I know your name
I still know your name
And I always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
84 takes a lifetime, but Bobby does it better
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on
One, two
One, two, three, four!
Always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
84 takes a lifetime, but Bobby does it better
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
We always loved the sad, sad songs
We always loved the sad, sad songs
We always loved the sad, sad songs
We always loved the sad, sad...Embed
