Wooderson LyricsAnd tonight the coastline is quiet
It's quieter than it's ever been
Honey, this town is a prison
With its four walls closin' in
And they got one pill to make you smaller
They got one pill to make you scream
Darlin', this heart is on fire
And this life is but a dream
All right, all right
All right, all right
You see, this town pulls my heartstrings
I fell in love with the Shrewsbury stars
But there's far too many diamonds
In the backseats of borrowed cars
And I could never stop this burnin'
Honey, I can't tell no lies
I could never stand the weather
Darlin', this heart is on fire
All right, all right
All right, all right
Tonight, tonight
We're gonna ride like silver on the desolation moonlight
Tonight, tonight
Ain't comin' back until the mornin' light
Tonight, tonight
It's all right, all right
Tonight, tonight
All right, all right
All right, all right
Dance in my moonlight, my old friend, the twilight
Dance in my moonlight, my old friend, the twilight
Dance in my moonlight, my old friend, the twilight
And dance in my moonlight, my old friendEmbed
