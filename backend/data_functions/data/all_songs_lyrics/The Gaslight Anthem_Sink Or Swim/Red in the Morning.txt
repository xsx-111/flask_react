Red in the Morning LyricsLet it ride, let it ride, let it roll off your mind
And don't say a single word, get back inside
Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night
Like I was a ghost
Let it ride, let it ride, let it roll off your mind
And don't say a single word, get back inside
Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night
Like I was a ghost in a dream
And it was all completely wrong, Virginia
You were much too much for me
I was a boy on the lawn with his eyes to the sky
You were Garbo, smoke, and deceit
But it was Saturday, September, and fire
It was a backdrop set in your smile
And it was all I could want in the sway of a song
I was haunted for so many years
Let it ride, let it ride, let it roll off your mind
And don't say a single word, get back inside
Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in your mind
Like I was a ghost in a dream
Say goodbye, say goodbye, give a kiss and a sigh
Never, never, never bring me back to your mind
Let it slide, slide, roll off your mind
Like I was a movie you'd seen
Oh, it was all just a crime, Virginia
Let your fire be mercy to me
I was a boy in your arms, safe in your arms
And you swore like a promise to me
That I would never, never, never leave your heart
No, I would never, never, never leave your heart
But where are you now? I can still feel you now
And I hear all your songs in the breeze
Let it ride, let it ride, let it roll off your mind
Don't say a single word, get back inside
Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night
Like I was a ghost in your dreams
Say goodbye, say goodbye, give a kiss and a sigh
Never, never, never bring me back to your mind
Let me slide, slide, roll off your mind
Like I was a movie you'd seen
Let it ride
Ride!
Let it ride, let it ride, let it roll off your mind
Don't say a single word, get back inside
Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night
Like I was a ghost in a dream
Oh, say goodbye, say goodbye, give a kiss and a sigh
Never, never, never bring me back to your mind
Let me slide, girl, slide, roll off your mind
Like I was a movie you'd seen
Say goodbye, say goodbye, give a kiss and a sigh
Never, never bring me back to your mind
Let me slide, roll off your mind
Like I was a movie you'd seen
Ha!Embed
