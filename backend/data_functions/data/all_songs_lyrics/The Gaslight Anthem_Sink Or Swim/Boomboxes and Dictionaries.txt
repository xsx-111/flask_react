Boomboxes and Dictionaries LyricsI took a drive today
I thought about you
I thought about a friend who passed
And how much we just went through
I saw the sun shine off a hood of a Cadillac
I thought about some things I said
And some I would take back
I thought about how fortunate I feel to be alive
And if you're scared of the future tonight
We'll just take it each hour, one at a time
It's a pretty good night for a drive
So dry up those eyes, and dry up those eyes
Because the radio will still play loud
Songs that we heard as our guards came down
Like in the summertime when we first met
I'll never forget, and don't you forget
These nights are still ours
I still love the way you smile
I still love the ocean
We should remember to slow down more often
And maybe we will
Now, there's a lot of good things comin' our way right now
A lot of bad has passed
And we survived the breakdowns
All is forgiven, water under bridges now
And if you're scared of the future tonight
We'll just take it each hour, one at a time
It's a pretty good night for a drive
So dry up those eyes, and dry up those eyes
Because the radio will still play loud
Songs that we heard as our guards came down
Like in the summertime when we first met
I'll never forget, and don't you forget
These nights are still ours!
And if you're scared of the future tonight
We'll just take it each hour, one at a time
It's a pretty good night for a drive
So dry up those eyes, and dry up those eyes
Because the radio will still play loud
Songs that we heard as our guards came down
Like in the summertime when we first met
I'll never forget, and don't you forget
These nights are still oursEmbed
