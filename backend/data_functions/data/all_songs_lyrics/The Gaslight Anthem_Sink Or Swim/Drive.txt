Drive LyricsIn my head, I am already gone
Side roads pointed up
Decisions decided on
But in my nights, there are restless hours
When three a.m. comes down
And nothin' else comes up
And the only thing we know
Is it's gettin' dark, and we'd better go
And the only thing we see
Are the despairs of the day
And if you're too tired
Go to sleep, my brothers, I...
And if you're too tired
Go to sleep, my brothers, I'm all right to drive
But in my heart
I'm the weary kind
I'm much too tired to cry
Though it's sad enough for tears
It's been try, fail, try for years
When the next year comes along
I don't know if I'll be home
I don't know if we'll survive
And the only thing we know
Is it's gettin' dark, and we'd better go
And the only thing we see
Are the despairs of the day
And if you're too tired
Go to sleep, my brothers, I...
And if you're too tired
Go to sleep, my brothers, I'm all right to drive
And we're much too young of men
To carry such heavy heads
And tonight for the first time
It felt good to be alive
And we're much too young of men
To carry such heavy heads
And tonight for the first time
It felt good to be alive again, my friend
Only thing we know
Is it's gettin' dark, and we'd better go
And the only thing we see
Are the despairs of the day
And if you're too tired
Go to sleep, my brothers, I...
And if you're too tired
Go to sleep, my brothers, I...
And if you're too tired
Go to sleep, my brothers, I...
And if you're too tired
Go to sleep, my brothers, I'm all right to driveEmbed
