Til I Gain Control Again Lyrics
Just like the sun over the mountaintop
You know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my mornings
Like sunlight hanging on your skin
I've never gone so wrong
As for telling lies to you
What you see is what I am
There is nothing I could hide from you
You see me better than I am

Out on the road that lies before me now
There is some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
'Til I can gain control again


And like a lighthouse, you must stand alone
Landmark a safe journey's end
No matter what sea I've been sailing on
I'll always come back home again

Out on the road that was before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
'Til I can gain control again
I only hope that you can hold me now
'Til I can gain control againEmbed
