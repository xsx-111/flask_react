Photograph Lyrics
Started out so innocent
Everything was simple and so plain
She was in a doorway
And I was walking nowhere down the main
She whispered something softly
And stepped into the light
Can you help me out she said
I'm a little lost tonight

One day love just hits you with a flash
Lights go off around you like some photograph

She said her bags were stolen
All they left her was the camera on her arm
Told me she was new in town
Only two weeks off the farm
Oh why did I believe her
Heaven only knows
One look in my eyes
And all my resolution goes

One day love just hits you with a flash
Leaves you staring blindly like some photograph
Pictures of two fools
Laughing at the world
Smiling as only good luck does
Truth is you're not even looking at me girl
All the time I was falling
You kept on stalling
Sizing up how big a fool I was


Pictures of two fools
Laughing at the world
Smiling as only good luck does
Truth is you're not even looking at me girl
All the time I was falling
You kept on stalling
Sizing up how big a fool I was

Woke up in the morning
I don't think that I had been asleep too long
The room was dark and empty
I could see that all my clothes and money were gone
Oh I've run out of excuses
And people I can blame
If she ever asked me too
I'd do it all again
One day love just hits you with a flash
Leaves you staring blindly like some photographEmbed
