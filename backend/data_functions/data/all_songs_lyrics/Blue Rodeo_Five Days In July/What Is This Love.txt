What Is This Love Lyrics
What is this love that I leave behind?
How can I turn from the tears in your eyes?
What is this world where we always pretend?
That it is worth it, worth it in the end

What is this life we share that I just throw away?
Is this love that causes so much pain?
What is the promise that I leave behind?
Why can't I just lie beside you again?

What's goin' on?
How'd it get so wrong?
What's goin' on?
How'd it get so wrong?


What is this dream that I'll never find?
What is this prayer that's stealing my mind?
What is this deal that I've just made with fate?
And I wonder if I have left it too late
What's goin' on?
How'd it get so wrong?
What's goin' on?
How'd it get so wrong?Embed
