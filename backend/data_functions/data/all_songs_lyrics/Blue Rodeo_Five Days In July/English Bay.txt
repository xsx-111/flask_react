English Bay Lyrics
One, two, one, two, three, four

You are so far away on this cold empty night
As I lie in a hotel room, looking at the street light
Outside my window, I listen to the rain
And the sounds of the passing cars
And the waves on English Bay

And I wonder if you think of me as I dream of you
Do you hear the song that I sing in this hotel room?
'Cause I see you in the stars above and in every setting sun
And even though you're fifteen hundred miles away, I hear howling at the moon


And I hold you in my mind
And I start to float away
Yeah, the whole world seems very strange
In a pleasant kinda way

And as the morning sun comes up
And puts an end to this long night
More than anything I wish
You were here, lying by my side
Holding me near, listening to the rain
And the passing cars
And the waves on English BayEmbed
