Cynthia Lyrics
So you saw that fire in the sky
Well I think that's so cool
And I know that nothin' will change you
You are nobody's fool

Cynthia
Won't you take me to
Pyramid Lake with you?
We could watch the space ships
Maybe they'd take us on a trip
Into that never-ending sky
Into wide and endless nite


And you stood in their beam of light
And they showed you the bones on the moon
Well I hope I get to go there
With you real soon

Cynthia
Won't you take me to
Pyramid Lake with you?
We could watch the space ships
Maybe they'd take us on a trip
Into that never-ending sky
Into wide and endless nite

We could get there
Before the sunsets
And we'd put up your tent
Watch the stars
Dance all nite
And watch the sun come up

Cynthia
Won't you take me to
Pyramid Lake with you?
We could watch the space ships
Maybe they'd take us on a trip
Into that never-ending sky
Into wide and endless niteEmbed
