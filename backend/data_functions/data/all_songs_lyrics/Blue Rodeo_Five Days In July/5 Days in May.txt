5 Days in May Lyrics
One
One, two, one, two, three, four

They met in a hurricane
Standing in the shelter out of the rain
She tucked a note into his hand
Later on, they took his car
Drove on down where the beaches are
He wrote her name in the sand
Never even let go of her hand

Somehow they stayed that way
For those five days in May
Made all the stars around them shine
Funny how you can look in vain
Livin' on nerves and such sweet pain
A loneliness that cuts so fine
Find the face you've seen a thousand times

Sometimes the world begins
To set you up on your feet again
And I know it wipes the tears from your eyes
How will you ever know
The way that circumstances go?
Always gonna hit you by surprise
But I know my past
You were there
In everything I've done
You are the one

Looking back it's hard to tell
Why they stood while others fell
Spend your life working it out
All I know is one cloudy day
They both just ran away
Rain on the windshield headed south
Oh, she loved the lines around his mouth

Sometimes the world begins
To set you up on your feet again
And I know it wipes the tears from your eyes
How will you ever know
The way that circumstances go?
Always gonna hit you by surprise
But I know my past
You were there
In everything I've done
You are the one
