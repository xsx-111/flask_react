Head Over Heels Lyrics
Sun breaks I can't wait
'Til I'll be on my way again
I'm sick and tired of waiting
With nothing to do
Watching the rain through a crack in the window
It's the little things that get you through
Like the same sun rising on me
Is rising over you

Walking and talking
Like birds in the sky
You tell your secrets
How gracefully you lie

That's the way you come to me
I'm head over heels
And I'm always gonna be
That's okay, I love the way you come to me

I guess we're tempting fate
A little too long it seems
Walking this heat
Is just like floating in a dream
I've been torn apart put back together
With a couple of pieces in wrong
I'm holding up now
But I won't be for long
Tossing and turning
Like waves in the sea
You show myself to me
You let me down easily

That's the way you come to me
I'm head over heels
And I'm always gonna be
That's okay, I love the way you come to me

I know one night together
Won't make up for ten apart
But I'm as steady as rain
Nothing ever changes in my heart
Throw off the covers
Open the windows
I don't care what we do
I've been standing for days
Now I get to fall down with you

Tossing and turning
Like waves in the sea
You show myself to me
You let me down easily
That's the way you come to me
I'm head over heels
And I'm always gonna be
That's okay, I love the way you come to meEmbed
