Know Where You Go/Tell Me Your Dream LyricsPart 1: Know Where You Go

Nothing can compare
To how I feel when I'm by your side
And nothing can compare
To the world I see in your eyes

'Cause I know where you go
Love how you know how to take me there
Yeah, I know where you go
Love how you know how to take me there

You fill my head
With colours of wonder and delight
You move across my mind
Like the dance of the Northern Lights

'Cause I know where you go
Love how you know how to take me there
Yeah, I know where you go
Love how you know how to take me there

Part 2: Tell Me Your Dream

As we sat in front of that August moon
You said the clouds they look like angel wings
Sometimes I wonder if you can read my mind
'Cause I was thinking the very same thing
When I'm with you all the stars shine through
My heart opens up like a morning flower
You know I'd leave it all behind
'Cause my only peace of mind is when I'm here with you

So tell me your dream
Lay your head on my pillow
Tell me the things that you hide away
Your pain
Your pleasure
Your sorrow
Tell me the things that you hide away
Your pain
Your pleasure
Your sorrowEmbed
