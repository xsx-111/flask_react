Bad Timing Lyrics
Hey, it's me what a big surprise
Calling you up from a restaurant 'round the bend
Just got in from way up North
I'm achin' tired now, and I could use a friend
I might be a fool
To think that you do
Wanna see me again

I know it's been a while since I talked to you
Nothing wrong, just nothing ever goes as planned
Many times I thought I'd call
I didn't have your number in my hand
I know it's true
That you'd never do
The same thing to me

I never meant to make you cry
And though I know I shouldn't call
It just reminds us of the cost
Oh, of everything we've lost
Bad timing that's all
And maybe soon there'll come a day
When no more tears will fall
We each forgive a little bit
And we both look back on it
As just bad timing that's all

We used to have so many plans
Something always seemed to turn out wrong
I never could catch up to you
Moving on and doing all you've done
I don't know why
The harder I try
The harder it comes

I never meant to make you cry
And though I know I shouldn't call
It just reminds us of the cost
Oh, of everything we've lost
Bad timing that's all
And maybe soon there'll come a day
When no more tears will fall
We each forgive a little bit
And we both look back on it
As just bad timing that's all
We each forgive a little bit
And we both look back on it
As just bad timing that's all1Embed
