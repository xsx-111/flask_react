Dark Angel Lyrics
I met this girl, she was walking through one of my dreams
She kissed my eyes
And everything that she said made so much sense to me
That I still feel like I'm half asleep

My dark angel, she gave me diamonds for eyes
She walked by, ow I'm hypnotised
By this dream that just won't stop
And I feel like I've always been lost in this dream

The rumours of heaven only speak the truth on earth
My dark angel, shine your light on my curse
You are the other that I have to find
Until I do, I guess I'll see you 'round my mind


So Colorado is a place I have to go
I heard a rumour she loves the mountains and the snow

My dark angel, she gave me diamonds for eyes
My dark angel, I offer you my heart
My dark angel, I think I loved you from the start
'Cause there's this face that I know that I've never seen
Sometimes I feel I'm livin' in someone else's dream
Still I thank you for stopping to talk
And I wonder just into who's dream did who walk

Oh, my dark angel, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light
Shine your light on me
On me, on meEmbed
