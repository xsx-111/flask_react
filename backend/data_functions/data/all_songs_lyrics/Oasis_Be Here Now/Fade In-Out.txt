Fade In-Out Lyrics
Said, let's go
Yeah
One, two, three, four

Get on the roller coaster, the fair's in town today
Y'gotta be bad enough to beat the brave
So get on the helter skelter, bowl into the fray
Y'gotta be bad enough to beat the brave

You fade in-out, you fade in-out
Without a doubt, I don't see no shine
Today is just a daydream
Tomorrow we'll be castaway

Coming in-out of nowhere, singin' rhapsody
Y'gotta be bad enough to wanna be
Sitting upside a high-chair, the devil's refugee
Is gonna be blinded by the light that follows me

She fade in-out, she fade in-out
Without a doubt, I don't see no shine
Today is just a daydream
Tomorrow she'll be cast away

We fade in-out, we fade in-out
Without a doubt, I don't see no shine
Today is just a daydream
Tomorrow you'll be cast away

So get off the roller coaster, the fair's in town today
Y'gotta be bad enough to meet the brave
Get on the helter skelter, step into the fray
Y'gotta be bad enough to beat the brave

You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-outEmbed
