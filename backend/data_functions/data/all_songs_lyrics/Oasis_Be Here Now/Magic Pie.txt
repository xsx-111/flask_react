Magic Pie Lyrics
An extraordinary guy
Can never have an ordinary day
He might live the long goodbye
But that is not for me to say
I dig his friends, I dig his shoes
He is just a child with nothing to lose
But his mind, his mind

They are sleeping while they dream
But then they want to be adored
They who don't say what they mean
Will live and die by their own sword
I dig their friends, I dig their shoes
They are like a child with nothing to lose
In their minds, yeah their minds

But I'll have my way
In my own time
I'll have my say
My star will shine

'Cause you see me I've got my magic pie
Think of me, yeah that was me I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone
There are but a thousand days preparing for a thousand years
Many minds to educate the people who have disappeared
D'you dig my friends? D'you dig my shoes?
I am like a child with nothing to lose in my mind
Yeah my mind

We'll have our way
In our own time
We'll have our say
Because my star's going to shine

'Cause you see me I've got my magic pie
Think of me, yeah that was me I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone
You see me I've got my magic pie
Think of me, yeah that was me I was that passer by, passer by
Think of me I've got my magic pie
Think of me, yeah that was me I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone
Yeah
Yeah
Yeaaaah
Shut up!2Embed
