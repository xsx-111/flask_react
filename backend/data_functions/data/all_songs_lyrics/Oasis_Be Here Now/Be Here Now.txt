Be Here Now Lyrics
Wash your face in the morning sun
Flash your pen at the song that I'm singing
Touch down bass living on the run
Make no sweat at the hole that you're digging

Wrap up cold when it's warm outside
Your shit jokes remind me of Digsy's
Be my magic carpet ride
Fly me down to capitol city in the sun

Kickin' up a storm from the day that I was born
Sing a song for me, one from Let It Be
Open up your eyes, get a grip of yourself inside

So wash your face in the morning Sun
Flash your pen at the song that I'm singing
Touch down bass living on the run
Make no sweat of the hole that you're digging

Kickin' up a storm from the day that I was born
Sing a song for me, one from Let it Be
Open up yer eyes, get a grip of yourself inside
Inside (get grip inside)
Inside (get grip inside)
You betcha!
So wrap up cold when it's warm outside
Please sit down, you make me feel giddy
Be my magic carpet ride
Fly me down to capitol city

I've been kicking up a storm from the day that I was born
Sing a song for me, one from Let it Be
Open up your eyes get a grip on yourself inside
(Get a grip inside, get a grip inside)
(Get a grip inside, get a grip inside)
You betcha!

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah2Embed
