My Big Mouth Lyrics
Everybody knows but no one's saying nothing
It was a sound so very loud but no one can hear
I got something in my shoes it's keeping me from walking
Down the long and winding road back home to you

And round this town, you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's going to take the blame for

My big mouth, my big name
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Into my big mouth, you could fly a plane
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame

I ain't never spoke to God
And I ain't never been to Heaven
But you assumed I knew the way
Even though the map was given
And as you look into the eyes
Of a bloody cold assassin
It's only then you'll realize
With whose life you have been messing
And round this town, you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's going to take the blame for

My big mouth, my big name
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Into my big mouth, you could fly a plane
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame

And round this town, you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's going to take the blame for

My big mouth, my big name
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Into my big mouth, you could fly a plane
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fameEmbed
