The Girl in the Dirty Shirt Lyrics
If I may be so bold that I just say something
Come and make me my day
The clouds around your soul
Don't gather there for nothing
But I can chase them all away
Why do you need a reason for to feel happy
Or shining for the rest of the world
Give me just a smile and would you make it snappy
Get your shit together girl

You've got a feeling lost inside you
It just won't let you go
Your life is sneaking up behind
It just won't let you go
No it just won't let you go
Is what I'm trying to say...

Is would you maybe
Come dancing with me, 'cause to me it doesn't matter
If your hopes and dreams are shattered
When you say something you make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
But I can see, I can see
If you ever find yourself inside a bubble
You got to make your own way home
You can call me anytime you're seeing double
Now you know you're not alone

You've got a feeling lost inside you
It just won't let you go
Your life is sneaking up behind
It just won't let you go
No it just won't let you go
Is what I'm trying to say...

Is would you maybe
Come dancing with me, 'cause to me it doesn't matter
If your hopes and dreams are shattered
When you say something you make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth
Maybe she'll come dancing with me
Because to me it doesn't matter
If her hopes and dreams are shattered
When she says something, she'll make me believe
You're the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me

And now I see
And now I see
And now I see
And now I see
And now I see
And now I see
And now I see
And now I see
And now I see
And now I see6Embed
