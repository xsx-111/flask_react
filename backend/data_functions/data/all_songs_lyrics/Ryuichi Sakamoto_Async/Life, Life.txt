Life, Life LyricsAnd this I dreamt, and this I dream
And some time this I will dream again
And all will be repeated, all be re-embodied
You will dream everything I have seen in dream
To one side from ourselves, to one side from the world
Wave follows wave to break on the shore
On each wave is a star, a person, a bird
Dreams, reality, death - on wave after wave
No need for a date; I was, I am, and I will be
Life is a wonder of wonders, and to wonder
I dedicate myself, on my knees, like an orphan
Alone - among mirrors - fenced in by reflections
Cities and seas, iridescent, intensified
A mother in tears takes a child on her lapEmbed
