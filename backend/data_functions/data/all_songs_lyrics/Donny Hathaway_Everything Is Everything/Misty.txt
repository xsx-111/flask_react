Misty LyricsLook at me
I'm, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty holding your hand
Yes I do
Walk my way
And a thousand, a thousand violins begin to play
It maybe the sound of your hello
Ooo the music
The music I hear
Heeeey
You know
I get misty whenever you're near
Yeah
You can say that you're leading, leading me on
Lordy, but it's just what I want to hear
Haven't you noticed
How hopelessly in love
That's why
That's why I'm following you
Yes I am
Yes I am
Baby
On my own
Oooooooo
Let me wonder
Let me wonder, you didn't want to let me know
Never knowing my right from my left
My half of my love
Oooooo
Yeah
I'm too misty and too much in love
Yes I am
Ooo
Baby
I'm too misty
Yeah
Misty and too much
Too much, too much in love
Yeah
HeeeeyEmbed
