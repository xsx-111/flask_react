Thank You Master (For my Soul) Lyrics
Thank You, Master, for my soul
Thank You, Master, thank You for my soul
You gave me food to eat, You put shoes on my feet
And You kept me
Lord, I know, haven't been so good this week
But You continue to bless me, yeah
And just wanna take time to thank You, for my soul

Thank You, Master, thank You for my soul
Lord, thank You, thank You, Master, thank You for my soul, yeah
'Cause You didn't have to hear my moanin'
Lord, You didn't have to hear my groanin'
But You kept me, yeah
You put shoes on my feet, You kept food for me to eat, yeah
And Lord, how You blessed me
But most of all, thank You, Master, for my soul
Thank You, thank You

That's alright


Woo-hoo
Thank You, Master, ha, Lord, thank You for my soul, yeah
Thank You for my hands, thank You for my feet
Thank You, Lord, thank You for my mind
Thank You for my soul
Lord, I know I haven't been so good this week, God
But You kept me
You didn't have to hear my moanin'
You didn't have to hear my groanin', hey, hey, hey, hey
But Lord, You blessed me, ha
And Lord, I wanna thank You
I just got to say "Much obliged" to You, Master
'Cause the walls of my room was not the walls of my grave
My bed was not my cooling board
Y'all don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
My sheet (My sheet) was not my windâ€” (Was not my winding sheet)
And I wanna say thank You, thank You
Thank You, thank You, thank You, I wanna thank You, Lord
Hey, hey, thank You for the rain in the storm
Thank You for my mother
I wanna thank You, oh, oh, ohEmbed
