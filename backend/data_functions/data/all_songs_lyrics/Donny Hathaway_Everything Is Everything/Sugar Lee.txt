Sugar Lee LyricsSugar Lee is her name
Ain't good lookin' and she's mean as thunder
But I love her just the same
I love her just the same, boys, I love her just the same
She likes to rock and she likes to roll
And sometimes she gets out of hand
But every night when I come home
She knows I'm her lovin' man
Still her lovin' man, boys, still her lovin' man
Well, I told her mama and I told her daddy
There ain't nothin' you can say
Sugar Lee is gonna be this poor boy's prize someday
One these days boys, one of these days
Well, you can have all your sweet Susanna's
And your big time bar room Queens
Ain't never been a woman, boys, like my Sugar Lee
Like my Sugar Lee, boys, like my Sugar Lee
Well, I've got a gal down in Tuscaloosa
Sugar Lee is her name
Ain't good lookin' and she's mean as thunder
But I love her just the same
I love her just the same, boys, I love her just the same
I love her just the same, boys, I love her just the same
Sugar Lee is her name
Ain't good lookin' and she's mean as thunderEmbed
