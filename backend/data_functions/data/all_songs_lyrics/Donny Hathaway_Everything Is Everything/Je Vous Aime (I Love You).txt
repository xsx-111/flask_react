Je Vous Aime (I Love You) Lyrics
I just want to say I love you, I love you
I just want to say I love you

You've been good to me so long that I want to say right now
(Je vous aime beaucoup)
Je vous aime beaucoup, that means I love you
Not too many times that I would praise you
So I just wanna say that I love you, baby, yes I do
Of all the things, needed, needed by a man
I think you should know it's you that I need more
'Cause I love you, baby
(I just want to say I love you, I love you)
Oh, I love you baby, yes I do
(I just want to say I love you)

Mhm, times haven't always been so very good for us, baby, no, no
(You stood by my side)
Yes you did, whoa, and that makes me love you
And baby, darlin', the road was mighty rough, mighty rough sometimes
(You held onto my hand)
But you held onto my hand
Whoa, that makes me love you, oh
Of all the things, all the things, baby, needed by a man
I think you should know it's you that I need more
'Cause I love you, baby
(I just want to say I love you, I love you)
I said I love you, baby
(I just want to say I love you)

Just be true to me and I'll be true
I want you to be faithful 'cause my love is true
I just want to say my love is here to stay
'Cause I love you
(I just want to say I love you, I love you)
Oh baby
(I just want to say I love you)

Don't you know that I love you
(I want to say that I love you)
I try to show you, baby, that I love you
(I want to say I love you)
Every day, sugar, I want you to know
(I want to say that I love you)
That I love you, baby, yes I do
(I want to say I love you)
Je vous aime beaucoup, oh baby
(I want to say I love you)
I said I love you, baby
(I want to say I love you)
You better believe it now
Oh baby
(I want to say I love you)Embed
