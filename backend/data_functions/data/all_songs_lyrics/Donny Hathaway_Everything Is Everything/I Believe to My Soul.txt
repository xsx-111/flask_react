I Believe to My Soul LyricsOne of these days
And it won't be long
You're gonna look for me and I'll be gone
I believe
Said I believe
Oooh yeah
Ooh baby
I believe you're trying to make a fool outta me
I said you're going 'round here with your head so hard
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod
'Cause I believe
Said I believe
Oooh yeah
I believe, baby
I believe you're trying to make a fool outta me
Yeah
Alright
Oooooo
Baby, baby, baby
Last night while you were sleeping
I heard you say
Ooooh Ronny
When you know my name
When you know my name
When you know my name is Donny
I believe
Oooh yeah
Wooo baby
I said I believe you're trying to make a fool outta me
I said you're going 'round here with your head so hard
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod
I've got to know how you really feel
I got to know if your love is really real
'Cause I believe
Oooo you don't want me
I said I believe
You dont need me
I believe
Oooo you've been slipping out on me, baby
Said I believe
Ooo you've been doing me wrong
I believe
I believe
I believe
Baby, I believeEmbed
