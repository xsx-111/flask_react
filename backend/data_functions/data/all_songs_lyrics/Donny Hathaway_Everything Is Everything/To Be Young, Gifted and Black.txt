To Be Young, Gifted and Black Lyrics
To be young, gifted, and Black
Oh, what a lovely, precious dream
To be young, gifted, and Black
Open your heart to what I mean, to what I mean

'Cause you know
In this whole wide world
There's a million, a million boys and girls
Who are young, gifted, and Black
That's a fact, oh, yes it is

To be young, gifted, and Black
We must begin to tell our young
Don't you know that there's a whole world
A whole world waiting for you
Haven't you heard the quest has just begun, mhm

Don't you know that the joy
The joy, the joy of today
Is the day that we all, that we all be proud to say
That we are young, gifted, gifted and Black
And it's sho'nuff where it's at
Oh yeah
Do you believe it?
I said it's sho'nuff where it's at
Oh, oh yeah
Can I get somebody to help me?
I said it's sho'nuff...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause you know it's sho'nuff
Oh, oh, oh yeah
I ain't tryna bring down nobody else
But I know it's sho'nuff, oh oh oh, oh yeah yeah yeah
I don't think you believe me, ooh-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo, yeah, yeah yeah
Can I say it again?
Woo-hoo-hoo, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah yeah
That's all, yeah
I said it's sho'nuff, oh oh ohEmbed
