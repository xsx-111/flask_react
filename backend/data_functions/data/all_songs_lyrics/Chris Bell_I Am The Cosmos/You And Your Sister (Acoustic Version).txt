You And Your Sister (Acoustic Version) LyricsThey say my love for you ain't real
But they don't know how real it feels
All I want to do
Is to spend some time with you
So I can hold you, hold you
Your sister says that I'm no good
You know I'd show her if I could
All I want to do
Is to spend some time with you
So I can hold you, hold you
Love you every day
Let me hear you say
Your love won't be leaving
Your eyes ain't deceiving
Love you every day
Let me hear you say
All I want to do
Is to spend some time with you
So I can hold you, hold you
If you can give me a little time
I will show you I ain't lying
All I want to do
Is to spend some time with you
So I can hold you, hold youEmbed
