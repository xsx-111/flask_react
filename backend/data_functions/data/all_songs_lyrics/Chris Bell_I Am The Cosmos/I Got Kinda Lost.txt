I Got Kinda Lost LyricsI got kinda lost
I got kinda lost
I got kinda lost in giving
I got kinda lost
And what can I say
Feeling the way I do
I'm trying to get it across to you
Only wanted to be together
All the time that it was I saw her
Things that I'd done before are gone
I can't believe I'm on my own
Once in a while
And I see you smile
But you don't know how it's going
I'm trying to get it across to you
Only wanted to be together
All the time that it was I saw her
Things that I'd done before are gone
I can't believe I'm on my own
I got kinda lost
I got kinda lost
I got kinda lost in giving
I'm trying to get it across to youEmbed
