There Was A Light LyricsThere was a light
So dear to me
I wanted to live
There was a time
So near to me
I asked you to give your life to me
If it's a sign
Sent down to me
I'm asking you why
It had to be
Spending all my time
Waiting to die
What's the use
There was a light
So dear to me
I wanted to live
There was a time
So dear to me
I asked you to give your life to meEmbed
