Look Up LyricsLook up, look up
You'll see the sky
Look up, look up
He's the life
Waiting to love you
Wanting to reach you
Look up, look up
You'll see the sky
The man walking down the street
Keeps his head down low
Doesn't look up
Wants to give up
He just keeps on looking down
Staring at the ground
Standing here at the corner
I'm watching him walk away
Standing here and I don't know why
But I'm thinking it could be a great day
Look up, look up
You'll see the sky
Oh I wish you knew him
He's been waiting for so long
If you look up you'll see him
You know we're all alone
Look up, look up
You'll see the sky
Look up, look up
He's the life
Waiting to love you
Wanting to reach you
Look up, look up
You'll see the skyEmbed
