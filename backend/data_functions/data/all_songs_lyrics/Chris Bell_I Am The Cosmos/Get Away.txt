Get Away LyricsI know what it is you're thinking
But baby, it's sacred to me
Whenever I feel like I'm sinking
You make a beautiful scene
You don't lie to me
And I wouldn't lie to you, oh no
Baby, I'm feeling low
Don't know what I'm going to do
Don't know what you're putting me through
Once in a while you're lonely
If you feel lonely, cry
I'd love to know what is the matter
Unless you're with some other guy
'Cause you don't lie to me
And I wouldn't lie to you, oh no
Baby I'm feeling low
Don't know what I'm going to do
You don't know what you're putting me through
Do you want me
I want you
Do you want me
I want you
Don't you know I'm losing sleep at night
Sleep at night
Don't know what I'm going to do
Don't know what you're putting me through
I know what it is you're thinking
But baby, it's strange to me
Whenever I feel like I'm sinking
You make a beautiful scene
Don't lie to me
And I wouldn't lie to you, oh no
And baby I'm feeling low
Don't know what I'm going to do
Don't know what you're putting me throughEmbed
