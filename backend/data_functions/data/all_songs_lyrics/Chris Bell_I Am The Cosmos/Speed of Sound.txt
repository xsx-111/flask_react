Speed of Sound LyricsI remember the first time
You said you loved me
I waited all weekend
You never called me
So you find him attractive
So what if he is
You'd like some excitement
We could go to St. Kitts
So it goes
On and on
My love grows
And yours is gone
A lonely existence
Well it's just a lie
If there is a reason
I'd like to know why
Something I want you to know
I've told you this once before
Don't want you to see him no more
Once again
You've let me down
Broke my heart
And turned me round
There's a light in the darkness
It doesn't seem far
There's something the matter
That's brought us ajar
The plane goes down
Will not land
Pilot's dead
Nowhere to be foundEmbed
