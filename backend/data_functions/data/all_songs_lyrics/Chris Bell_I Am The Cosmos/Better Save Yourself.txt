Better Save Yourself LyricsI'm off the street
I'm all alone
I just can't think
What I've been doing wrong
I know you're mine
He treats you nice
It's suicide
I know, I tried it twice
You should've given your love to Jesus
It couldn't do you no harm
Should've given your love to Jesus
It wouldn't do you no harm
You've been sitting on your ass
Trying to find some grace
But you better save yourself
If you wanna see his face
I guess there are things
You'd like to know
It's getting late
And I know you want to go
You should've given your love to Jesus
It couldn't do you no harm
Should've given your love to Jesus
It wouldn't do you no harm
You've been sitting on your ass
Trying to find some grace
But you better save yourself
If you wanna see his face
I'm off the street
I'm all alone
I just can't think
What I've been doing wrongEmbed
