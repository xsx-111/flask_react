I Am The Cosmos LyricsEvery night I tell myself "I am the cosmos
I am the wind"
But that don't get you back again
Just when I was starting to feel okay
You're on the phone
I never want to be alone
Never want to be alone
I hate to have to take you home
Want you too much to say no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Never want to be alone
I hate to have to take you home
Want you too much to say no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My feelings always have been something I couldn't hide
I can confide
Don't know what's going on inside
So every night I tell myself "I am the cosmos
I am the wind"
But that don't get you back again
I'd really like to see you again
I really want to see you again
I'd really like to see you again
I really want to see you again
I'd really like to see you again
I really want to see you again
I never want to see you again
I really want to see you againEmbed
