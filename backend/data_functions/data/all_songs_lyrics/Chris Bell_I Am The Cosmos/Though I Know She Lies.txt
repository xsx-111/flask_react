Though I Know She Lies LyricsWhen I look though your eyes
I tend to get bitter
Maybe I'm best advised
To look to myself
I fall every time
Though I know she lies
I can't stay away
Stars would fall from the skies
And I won't forsake you
You've got lust in your heart
What's sad to me
I'll use every line
Anything to make you mine
Keeping me in the dark
Wondering where you are
Don't let me fall apart
You said take it slow
But I don't know
I don't know
Lying awake in the bed trying to
Cope with my feelings
I'm don't know if it's love
But what can I do
I fall every time
Though I know she lies
I can't stay awayEmbed
