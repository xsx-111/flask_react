Buzzards and Dreadful Crows Lyrics
The lifeblood, the lighthouse flashing
Sixteen chicks remain on watch
For the wheels to come rolling in
And they do
Yes, they always do
I'd be bored and disappointed if they didn't

Buzzards and dreadful crows
Right on the tip of my nose
They wait like cats and fly out
For the light in my eyes to die out
And it does
Yes, it always does
I'd be shocked and removed if it didn't

Buzzards and dreadful crows
A necessary evil, I suppose
There's something in this deal for everyone
Did you really think that you were the only one?

Buzzards and dreadful crows
A necessary evil, I suppose
There's something in this deal for everyone
Did you really think that you were the only one?
You were the only oneEmbed
