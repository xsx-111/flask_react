A Big Fan of the Pigpen Lyrics
Oh, to think on one's feet, to beat on one's brain
The Popular Mechanics are at it again
A tenement filled with sideshow freaks assembled to downgrade
An impeccable arrangement by the soft-rock renegades
And give me time to light a sentimental torch tonight
I'm a big fan of the pigpen

Sharper than most, cut with X-Acto
God is all good, ex post facto
Ba, ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ba, ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da

Oh, oh...Embed
