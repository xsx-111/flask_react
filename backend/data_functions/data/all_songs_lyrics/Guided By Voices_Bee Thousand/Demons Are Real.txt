Demons Are Real Lyrics
Deliver this message to the one I love the most
I've lost all my money to a three-hundred-pound ghost
Squeaky was a sad child, the product of neglect
Got stung by a jellyfish demanding her respect

Demons are real
They are standing still
Demons are real
They are standing stillEmbed
