Her Psychology Today Lyrics
Yeah, you know things could get much worse
You know things could get much worse
Could be better, yeah

Her psychology today is to play the crying game
To elicit a response to determine every gain
And I'm wanting to attain something in this turnabout
When she speaks, the flag unfurls and the heavens split in half
When she launches her attack in her opening paragraph

And she is having the time of my life
And she is having, she is


Hey, you know things could get much better
Could be better
Hey, you know things could get much better
Gotta be better, you knowEmbed
