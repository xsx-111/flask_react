Awful Bliss Lyrics
You chose a giant step, and caught your eye
Guaranteed sweetness that you thought broken
And you were not fine
And bearing in mind other ones that you could have wed
And hopefully dread

And I wouldn't dare to bring out this awful bliss
No, I wouldn't dare to bring out your awful bliss
So, I wouldn't dare to bring out this awful blissEmbed
