I Am a Scientist Lyrics
I am a scientist, I seek to understand me
All of my impurities and evils yet unknown
I am a journalist, I write to you to show you
I am an incurable, and nothing else behaves like me

And I know what's right
But I'm losing sight of the clues
For which I search and choose to abuse to just unlock my mind
Yeah, and just unlock my mind

I am a pharmacist, prescriptions, I will fill you
Potions, pills, and medicines to ease your painful lives
I am a lost soul, I shoot myself with rock and roll
The hole I dig is bottomless, but nothing else can set me free

And I know what's right
But I'm losing sight of the clues
For which I search and choose to abuse to just unlock my mind
Yeah, and just unlock my mind

I am a scientist, I seek to understand me
I am an incurable, and nothing else behaves like me
Everything is right
Everything works out right
Everything fades from sight
Because that's alright with me1Embed
