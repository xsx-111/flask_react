Yours to Keep Lyrics
To see you sight unseen is worse
Then pick you up because you're first
And go where the whistle blows
And go where the captain knows is just a lie

To train the bear to not get up
Slay the beast and win the cup
And stay with the sweet flesh prize
A necklace of fifty eyes is yours to keepEmbed
