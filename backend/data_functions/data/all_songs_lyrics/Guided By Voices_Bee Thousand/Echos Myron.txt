Echos Myron Lyrics
Tower to the skies, an academy of lies
And what goes up surely must come down
And we felt the mighty blowout with the walls coming down
Or something like that
Most of us are quite pleased with the same old song
And all of a sudden I'm relatively sane
With everything to lose and nothing to gain
Or something like that

Men of wisdom and men of compromise
Men of weak flesh in an armored disguise
All fall down

"If it's right you can tell"
Echos Myron like a siren with endurance like the Liberty Bell
And he tells you of the dreamers, but he's cracked up like the road
And he'd like to lift us up, but we're a very heavy load
And we're finally here
And shit yeah, it's cool
And shouldn't it be
Or something like that...
