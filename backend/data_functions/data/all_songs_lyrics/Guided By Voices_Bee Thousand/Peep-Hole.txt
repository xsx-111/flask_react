Peep-Hole Lyrics
Give me the cost of the albatross
And wear it around your neck for size
Don't let it get you down
I'm looking inside your house
And oh, and it smells so nice
Your house always looks so nice

Wherein you're twice as high laughing
Maybe the time is right, you know
Promise me not to leave
I'm looking inside your brain
Christ, it's a cluttered mess
I love you, I must confess

La la-la-la-la, la-da-da
La la-la-la-la, la-da-da
La-la-la, la-da-da-da-da
La-la-la-la, da-da-da-da-daEmbed
