Smothered in Hugs Lyrics
In the summer that you came
There was something eating everyone
And the sunshine fund was low
We couldn't greet you with a simple hello
And the watchers of the flood
Were busy in their chambers
Making sure there was new blood
To sustain their dying veins

But I believed you
No need for further questioning
I-I'm gonna leave with you
You can teach me all you know
Which way will we go now
On our trip to taller windows?
I really don't know now
I really don't know

In the winter that you left
There was business as usual
With the same old fears and frustrations
But the word got out, it was really such a pity
But the judges and the saints
And the textbook committee
Decided you should be left out
Not even mentioned
But I believed you
No need for further questioning
I-I'm gonna leave with you
You can teach me all you know
Which way will we go now
On our trip to taller windows?
I really don't know nowEmbed
