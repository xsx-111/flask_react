Mincer Ray Lyrics
Mincer ray, don't worry if the road's a little worn
It's a cold and filthy chasm that we're traveling on
Richer days assured me of the weak-link mending plan
Danger's always there to follow, just do the best you can
And a light shines down


Mincer ray, don't worry if the road's a little worn
It's a cold and filthy chasm that we're traveling on
And a light shines down
And a light shines downEmbed
