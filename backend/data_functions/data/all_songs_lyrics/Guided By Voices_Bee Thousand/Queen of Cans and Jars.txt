Queen of Cans and Jars Lyrics
To see the light and try but fail
On jagged seas that can't be sailed
And sought to lead but always trailed
Asked questions anyway

And all around the breeding grounds
The nymphos sweetly played
The queen of cans and jars will keep them safe

To be so keen on global trend
To be so tight on how and when
To scratch and claw until the end
To work for each new day

And all around the hunting ground
The dead were on display
The queen of cans and jars will keep them safeEmbed
