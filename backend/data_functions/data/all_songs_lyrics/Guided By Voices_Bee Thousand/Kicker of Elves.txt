Kicker of Elves Lyrics
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves

On high seas, you search of
The sickly sweet milk of selfish love
And knife these for warm fresh blood

Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves

In studded crown, the thief of souls
The parasites, the bugs of gold
This fertile land, now spoiled and sold

Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
