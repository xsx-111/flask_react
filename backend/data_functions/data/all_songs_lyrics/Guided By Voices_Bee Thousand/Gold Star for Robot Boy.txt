Gold Star for Robot Boy Lyrics
If I waited for you
To signify the moves that I should make
I'd be on the take
Gold star for robot boy
Well then, that's okay

If I waited for you
To show me all the actions I should take
Would I get my break?
Gold star for robot boy
And it's one thing. and it's something to do

The robot boy, yeah
If I waited for lessons in true confessions
That could take all day
But I'm here to stay
Gold star for robot boy
Well then, that's my move
Well then, that's my move
Well then, that's my move
But it's one thing
Yeah, it's something to do
The robot boy, yeah
If I waited for you
To signify the moves that I should make
I'd be on the take
Gold star for robot boy
Well then, that's okayEmbed
