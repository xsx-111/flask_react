Wanderlust LyricsHere comes Johnny vagrant
Between the lines of the history page
Founder of the modern age
Trickles through the hourglass sands
Biter of the helping hand
He's left behind the promised land
Here comes Johnny vagrant
The scapegoat of an accident
Skin a wrap of discontent (?)
Blues heavy as a wide load (?)
He's on to another one night stand
He's left behind the promised land
You find him in cash
Your adultery
In your lover's tired personality
And in the warm glow of security
He's in the spoiled kids yapping around your feet
The two faced people that you meet
The back stab business deal you just complete
You just complete
You wanna know why your culture stagnated?
Because you locked your garden gate
The sharp regards that separate
So dig as deeply as you can
Gaze on the maker's random plan
Here comes Johnny vagrant
Here comes a very awful manEmbed
