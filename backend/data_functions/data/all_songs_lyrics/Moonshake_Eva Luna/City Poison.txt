City Poison LyricsYou walk like a thief into my life
You do not respect my bed just for the night
You slag off everthing that I hold dear
And you bring your city poison 'round here
City poison
City poison
Where the rain smells dirty as exhaust
Where people have media, not thoughts
Where the sun throws square shadows
Where too much means nothing to do with your
Artifical prices and fashionable fears
You bring your city poison 'round here
City poison
City poison
You use what is given without debt
You spend the commitment like a check
You fuck to find your peace of mind, you can't see the mess you leave behind
Your progress is empty but sincere
And you bring your city poison 'round here
City poison
