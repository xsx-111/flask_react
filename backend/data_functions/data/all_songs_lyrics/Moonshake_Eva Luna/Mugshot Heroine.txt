Mugshot Heroine LyricsIn the margins by the terminal station
You trip towards the cliff edge swinging
There's a limit to a martyr's imagination
Heart on  cut glass drinking
Where you're trading, mister cash comes quick
Until you climb into the car of a sick trick
And he'll take care of your looks for good
He'll streak your hair in  blood
You fell, but you will never tell
In a circus with no safety net
In the street where danger treads
She's lying in the gutter
All menstrual red
You will die a mugshot heroine
A jack of a nine will live the fate
Until he saw the papers, he didn't even know your name
A dinner with a real person was not part of the game
Now you're gone and we all sympathize
But judgment harbors in our eyes
But he'll never find the runt that killed you
And there'll only be cops to criticize
When you fall, no one hears at all
 all the city spaces
There's nothing as common as the sorrow 
Nothing as bland as pretty faces
Nothing as bland as pretty facesEmbed
