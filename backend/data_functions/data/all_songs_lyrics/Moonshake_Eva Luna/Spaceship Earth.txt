Spaceship Earth LyricsAnd there’s nothing like haste
To make you stick in your way
But you never even get a second place
And no one ever looks to see your worth
Right now you feel like the last man
On Spaceship Earth
On Spaceship Earth
And there’s nothing like a past
To bring up your pain
But you never even notice
As you’re taken away
And it’s too late to try to end things fast
Unless you’re the last man
On Spaceship Earth
On Spaceship Earth
And there’s nothing like a hole
To hang on the future
But it’s such a long drive
To even reach that
And there’s no point in waiting for a change
You must behave as if you’re the last man
On Spaceship Earth
On Spaceship Earth
And something like the Sun
Falls over the horizon
Now  ticks away
As the decade’s dying
It’s the end of the millennium, a virgin birth
You sold the wild hopes of the last man
On Spaceship Earth
On Spaceship EarthEmbed
