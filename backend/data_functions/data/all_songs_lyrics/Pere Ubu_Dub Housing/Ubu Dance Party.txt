Ubu Dance Party LyricsI did not see the darkened sky
I did not feel the pressure drop
I walked down the primrose path
I strolled along the garden walk
The rain fell and washed away
I built on sand
I got swept away
I went out and stirred the air
(My soup was steeped in strange ideas)
I breathed in
I breathed out
I breathed in
I breathed out
The rain fell and washed away
I built on sand
I got swept away
I went out and looked around
I went out
And I came back
I walked down the primrose path
I strolled along the garden walk
The rain fell and washed away
My bed of sand got swept away1Embed
