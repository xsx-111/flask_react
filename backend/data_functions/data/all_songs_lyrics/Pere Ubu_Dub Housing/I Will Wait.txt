I Will Wait LyricsThe sun never sets on this world I have found
There's no reason
No, no reason
I will wait
Saw secret scenes in the cracks of the cities
Secret scenes in the seams of the world
I will wait
I believe in practicalities
Practicalities are possibilities
I will wait
And this occurs:
Idle I
