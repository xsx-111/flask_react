Drinking Wine Spodyody LyricsI see her nearly everyday
Just a girl but she's okay
I figure if she's heaven sent
New disclosures should be imminent
Real strain could be evident
Metaphysics would be provident
I'd sure to be obedient
I'd love to be penitent
Here she comes
And then there she goes
Cloud one, four, nineEmbed
