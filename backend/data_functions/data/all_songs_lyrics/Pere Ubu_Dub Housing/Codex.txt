Codex LyricsI think about you all of the time
I did this
And I went there
And I think about you all of the time
The day fades away
And the night passes over
And I think about you all of the time
I think about you all of the time
Here come my shoes
Here comes me!
One, two;
One...
I think about you all of the time
Step after step
Block after block
I think about you all of the time
The day fades away
And the night passes over
And I think about you all of the time
I think about you all of the time
I hear, I say
I see, I do
I think about you all of the timeEmbed
