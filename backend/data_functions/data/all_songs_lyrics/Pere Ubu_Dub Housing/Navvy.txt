Navvy LyricsI've got these arms & legs that flipflop
Flip flop
I've got these arms & legs that flipflop
Flip flop
I've got these arms & legs that flipflop
Flip-flip-flop!
I have desire
"Freedom!"
I have desire
"Somewhere to go!"
(Boy, that sounds swell!)
In my ears I heard a hurricane blow
In my ears I heard a hurricane grow
In my ears I heard a hurricane glow
I have desire
"Freedom!"
I have desire
"Somewhere to go!"
(Boy, that sounds swell!)
I've got these arms & legs that flipflop
Flip flop
I've got these arms & legs that flipflop
Flip flop
I've got these arms & legs that flipflop
Flip-flip-flop!
I have desire
"Freedom!"
I have desire
"Somewhere to go!"
(Boy, that sounds swell!)1Embed
