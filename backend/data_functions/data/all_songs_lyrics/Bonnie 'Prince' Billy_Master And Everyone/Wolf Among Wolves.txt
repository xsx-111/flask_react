Wolf Among Wolves LyricsShe loves a soul
That I've never been
A dog among dogs
A man among men
And every day
When I come home to her
She holds a phantom
She kisses and she hugs him
And I am not
Averse to how she loves him
Why must I live and walk
Unloved as what I am
Why can't I be loved as what I am
A wolf among wolves, and not as a man
Among men
She craves a home
That she can go in
A sheltered cave
That I have never seen
Not in my life
And not even in my dreams
Why can't I be loved as what I am
A wolf among wolves, and not as a man
Among menEmbed
