Master and Everyone LyricsY'tell me you don't love me
Well I don't love you
You say you don't want me
Well I don't want you
You tell me there are other
Fish in the sea
And another gathers
Roses for me
On this we will agree
You do what you want
And I will do what I want;
I'm now free of master and everyone
Servant of all and servant to none
And constancy and love is a joke
I'm not afraid of meeting you
I'm fickle, and I brag about it;
Neither will I cry for you
Like a bird freed from his cage
All night and all day I'll play and sing
And you do what you want
And I will do what I want;
I'm now free of master and everyone
Servant of all and servant to noneEmbed
