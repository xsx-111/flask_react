Maundering LyricsMaundering, i'm maundering
Evil eyes just passing trough
Maundering, oh maundering
Do you know what i'm wanting to do?
I'm going to find something true
Well i never to be what you wanted to see
And i wish that she would be patient with me
Maundering, i'm maundering
Evil is as evil do
Maundering, just maundering
God is always showing this to you
I'm going to glorify everything good
And put right what is wrong, as i should
Time was it began
There is no plan
So i hold you in my hand 'till you see
Only you and...Embed
