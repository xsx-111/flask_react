Even If Love LyricsOnce again in the world
Of twelve-hundred feelings
All in electric lights
We see what we can
I love the sound o' wind
Blowing at night through trees
From the roof i can see toons
Past the houses of the city
And i have been yours
In fall and in praying
And i loved to look at you
From the side at night
With music playing
And love will protect you
To the edge of the wood
And a monster will get you
And love does no good
And even if love were not what i wanted
Love would make love the thing most desiredEmbed
