The Way LyricsWinter comes and snow
I can't marry you, you know
Without children to grow
I can't marry you, you know
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love you
Take a year in your hands
You can find another man
Let your unloved parts get loved
I will be your man
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love you
Places you should be afraid
Into the river we will wade
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love youEmbed
