Hard Life LyricsAnd it's a hard life
For a man with no wife
Baby, it's a hard life
God makes you live
But without it
Don't doubt it
You don't even have
Your tears to give
I wake up and I'm I'm fine
With my dreaming still on my mind
But it don't take long, you see
For the demons to come and visit me
And I've got my problems
Sometimes love don't solve them
And I end each day
In a song
And it's a hard life
For a man with no wife
Lord, it's a hard life
God makes you live
But without it
Baby don't doubt it
You don't even have
Your tears to give
I know I'm a hard man
To live with sometimes
Maybe it ain't in me
To make you a happy wife of mine
And maybe you'll kill me
Honey I don't blame you
If I was in your place
Maybe that's what i would do
But I ain't breathing, let me breathe
Let me go, let me leave
I don't know, but I might lose
I might bum, might need to blow a fuse
So let me go
Lay it down
On my own
Let me drown
Let me go
Go where you don't knowEmbed
