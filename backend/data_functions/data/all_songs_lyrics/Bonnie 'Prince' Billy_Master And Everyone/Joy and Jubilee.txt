Joy and Jubilee LyricsThere's no reason to be seen
No one knows where i have been
Where i have been
I mean love is what i mean
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
This is what i want to be
Everything inside of me
Inside of me
Where only shoes should be
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
Everything
Is on the wing
And every face is in a hidden placeEmbed
