Three Questions LyricsSay I found a piece of rock
And put it in my pocket
And for the day that we are wed
I put it in a locket
Which is to hang around your neck
As long as you see fit
Well, tell me, o my love
Do you think that you would wear it?
And on the day that threatens
That the earth might open up
The birds have stopped their singing
And the insects have shut up
And all that's left between us
Is some al-homdillillilie
Oh would you split it with me, baby
So that I wouldn't die?
And after all these things
Is a question I must ask
When everyone has called me out
And said I am the worst
And asked for voices on my side
My love, would you sing first?
Would you say, "He's okay
He's better than the rest ;
He's innocent in god's eyes
And in mine, he is the best"?Embed
