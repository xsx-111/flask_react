The Twins / Romantica LyricsFrom the evening sky
A thousand shining diamonds hanging
Like the sparkle in the glasses on New Year's Eve
Sparkling
Romantica
What has happened to us?
What will happen to the vampire cult?
Better off at home tonight
Wouldn't be good company
Blonde grass
Strand by strand
Calling out your name and gently to the twins
The twins call out to the freaks
All the allure
So spellbound1Embed
