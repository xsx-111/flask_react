Reed to Hillsborough Lyrics
Light it up, breathe it in
You know they say we'll live again
Needle down, candles on
My favorite cup and a hi-fi stereo
Everything's not so bad

It's the way home should be
The way the windows frame the trees
And smoke fills the room
Colder now than last year
You know they say we'll all be dead
Needle down, needle inEmbed
