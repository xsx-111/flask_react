Chromosome Damage LyricsYou're fighting on the streets
Put you with all the thieves and cheats
Going off to fight in the war
I don't know why but I do know more
Cheating in the streets and fighting on the lines
I don't know why you should take my advise
Got my baby and I want to go there
You know they say the streets are no-where
Well I want to fly
I want to fly away
You know the way things fade
I can standEmbed
