Pharoah Chromium LyricsMidnight is like afternoon
Don’t get out much cept in ‘72
Keep me here locked in this room
With my snakes and my colored tattoo
But I figure I could give you the sky
If you just do what I say
I heard the princess was in town
You make sure she comes around
Don’t give me no line as we stand here in time
I can see you dancing close to him
