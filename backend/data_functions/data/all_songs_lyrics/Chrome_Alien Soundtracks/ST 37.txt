ST 37 LyricsSexual chakra
Same old soap opera
Environment
Surrounded by cement
Latest scoop on Degas
Painting of Las Vegas
Capsulized resort
On police report
ST 37
ST 37
ST 37
Take you up to heaven
Get in the Winnebago
Go down to San Diego
Going to have to tango
At the next fandango
Where you going to go?
What you going to do
When your destiny
Comes after you?
ST 37
ST 37
ST 37
Take you up to heaven
Take you up to heaven
Take you up to heavenEmbed
