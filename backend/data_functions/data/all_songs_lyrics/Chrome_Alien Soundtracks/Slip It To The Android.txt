Slip It To The Android LyricsThen it suddenly occurs to
Slip it to the android
You don't like the disguise but so what
Slip it to the android
You had nothing better to do going over crater 452
Slip it to the android
Lift up the mechanical robe
Slip it to the android
3 moons out tonight
Everything’s so clean and white
Sure feels good from a different point of viewEmbed
