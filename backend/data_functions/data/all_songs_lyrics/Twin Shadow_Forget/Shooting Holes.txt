Shooting Holes LyricsBite the hand, I know she doesn't care
Leave the trail, the hounds will find us anywhere
Call the cops and tell 'em what we've done
Tell 'em that tonight we stole your father's guns
With your right hand, you saying
I think we're gonna be so close
Let's sing a song on our way back home
You and me, shooting holes at the moon
You and me, (on our way back home) shooting holes at the moon
You and me, shooting holes at the moon
Take my hand, there's no one here to see
Push your bones against the earth, believe
With your right hand, you saying
I think there's gonna be so close
Let's sing a song on our way back home
You and me, shooting holes at the moon
You and me, (on our way back home) shooting holes at the moon
You and me, shooting holes at the moon
(on our way back home)
You and me, shooting holes at the moon
You and me, (on our way back home) shooting holes at the moon
You and me, shooting holes at the moon1Embed
