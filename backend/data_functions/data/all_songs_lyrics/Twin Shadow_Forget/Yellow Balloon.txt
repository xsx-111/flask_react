Yellow Balloon LyricsFollow me till the dawn
O'er these trees on mother's lawn
To the chapel in the valley when the day is done
And we'll get married when our friends have gone
In the pines, we learn to speak
In the leaves, forget to breathe
If you hear your mama calling, get away from me
If you hear your mama calling, get away from me
Secret handshakes
The swimming hole
Keep awake
Or we will not go home
Come on everyone, come on down
Try to keep your face out of the sun
If you go lost, the face of the moon
Follow the boy with the yellow balloon
Follow me till the dawn
O'er these trees on mother's lawn
To the chapel in the valley when the day is done
And we'll get married when our friends have gone
In the pines, we love to speak
In the leaves, forget to breathe
If you hear your mama calling, get away from me
If you hear your mama calling, get away from me
Secret handshakes
The swimming hole
Keep awake
Or we will not go home
Come on everyone, come on down
Try to keep your face out of the sun
If you go lost, face of the moon
Follow the boy with the yellow balloon
Come on everyone, come on down
Try to keep your face out of the sun
If you go lost, face of the moon
Follow the boy with the yellow balloonEmbed
