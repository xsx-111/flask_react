Tyrant Destroyed Lyrics
I know you spent some time from the town to the city
Looking for a life to start
And when you were fifteen, I know what you said
"I'll never let another black boy break my heart"

You waited a decade for me to come find you
There's never been a chance so rare
I was just stumbling out on a prosthetic love
And there had never been someone so real

This was love, and I was such a tyrant destroyer
As you sat sinking in my hands
Love, and I was such a tyrant destroyer
As you sat sinking in my hands

As if it wasn't enough just to hear you speak
They had to give you lips like that
Like all of your sadness reduced to a color
Then painted upon you, how could I forget you?

And who was I to think that on a Saturday night
That you would really bike home alone?
And the way that I left you just hanging on Sundays
Any fair-skin boy could take you home
This was love, and I was such a tyrant destroyer
As you sat sinking in my hands
Love, and I was such a tyrant destroyer
As you sat sinking in my hands
Love, and I was such a tyrant destroyer
As you sat sinking in my hands
Love, and I was such a tyrant destroyer
As you sat sinking in my handsEmbed
