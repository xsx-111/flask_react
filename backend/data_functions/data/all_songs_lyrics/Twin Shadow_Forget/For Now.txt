For Now LyricsFar gone are summer girls
In bed with thankless boys
And all the lives that need to keep
Awake another century
Far gone are perfect days
For now I'll have to wait
In bed with all the ones I hate
To give myself, myself away
I belong to you now
And that's not gonna change
I belong to you
And nothing's been the same
Is there anything as quiet as a night alone with you?
Had it ever been as clear on the day that you went away?
Don't speak from other lives
Don't need your hopeful light
Your hand upon my face is fine
Remind me of my place this time
Someone must've told the man in the sky
To paint a portrait of you and I
Someone must've gone and told him why
Someone must've told the man in the sky
(Is there anything as quiet as a night)
To paint a portrait of you and I
(Alone with you)
Someone must've gone and told him why
(Had it even been as clear on the day that you went away)
Is there anything as quiet as a night alone with you?
(I belong to you now and that's not gonna change)
Had it ever been as clear on the day that you went away?
(I've been on to you and nothings been the same)
Is there anything as quiet as a night alone with you?
Had it ever been as clear on the day that you went away?Embed
