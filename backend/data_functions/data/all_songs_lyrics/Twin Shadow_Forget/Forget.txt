Forget LyricsThey’ll give us something
They’ll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it
They’ll give us something
They’ll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it
With pencil and knife
You heard your love again
You wrestled your nightmares
The sweat in your bed sheets
This is all of it
This is everything I’m wanting to forget
When winter sets in
It has a way of crystallizing the bad times
The fevers, the heart aches
This is all of it
This is everyone I’m wanting to forgive
They’ll give us something
They’ll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it
With pencil and knife
You heard your love again
You wrestled your nightmares
The sweat in your bed sheets
This is all of it
This is everything I’m wanting to forget1Embed
