Castles in the Snow LyricsYou're my favorite daydream (ah-ah ah-ah)
I'm your famous nightmare
Everything I see looks like gold
Everything I touch goes cold
Castles in the snow
Here's all I know
Your checkered room and your velvet bow
Your Elvis song in my ears
That moonlit voice that I hear
Now we are old as bread
We walk along our golden crest
We hide away for a week
We only look and don't speak
You're my favorite daydream (ah-ah ah-ah)
I'm your famous nightmare
Everything I see looks like gold
Everything I touch goes cold
Castles in the snow
(ah-ah ah-ah)
You're my favorite daydream (ah-ah ah-ah)
I'm your famous nightmare
Everything I see looks like gold
Everything I touch goes cold
Castles in the snow
Here's all I know
Your checkered room and your velvet bow
Your Elvis song in my ears
That moonlit voice that I hearEmbed
