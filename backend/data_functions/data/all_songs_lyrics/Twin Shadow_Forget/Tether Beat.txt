Tether Beat LyricsIs your heart not heavy when she says goodbye?
Do you reach for another when you turn off the light?
Do you sigh yourself awake? Is there nothing you can fake?
Do you wear it on your face like it's all you can take?
Does your heart still beat?
Does your heart still beat?
Does your heart still beat?
Does your heart still beat?
All my golden looks will pay for you someday soon
All my grief now spills around you
My lover is so thin at the end of the day
Is it too much to ask for? Put it away
Do we pry ourselves to sleep?
Is there nothing that's complete?
Is this silver string pulling my hands to eat?
Does your heart still beat?
Does your heart still beat?
Does your heart still beat?
All my golden looks will pay for you someday soon
Does your heart still beat?
Does your heart still beat?
All my grief now spills around you
Does your heart still beat?
Does your heart still beat?
All my golden looks will pay for you someday soon
Does your heart still beat?
Does your heart still beat?
All my grief now spills around you
Does your heart still beat?Embed
