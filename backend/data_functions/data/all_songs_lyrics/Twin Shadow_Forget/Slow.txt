Slow LyricsDon't turn me over, just let me know
How long will it be before you let me go?
You hold the line, a bullet soul
It's just that sometimes, times, so slow
Sometimes, times, so slow
I don't wanna, believe, but be, in love
I don't wanna, be, believe, in love
Don't put me on, just let me in
How many times did you let me win?
Give me one more, my ticket's in
Oh, can we try again
Can we try again
I don't wanna, believe, but be, in love
I don't wanna, be, believing, in love
I don't wanna, believe, but be, in love
I don't wanna, be, believing, in love
I don't wanna, believe, be but, in love
I don't wanna, be, believe, in love
I don't wanna, believe, be but, in love
I don't wanna, be, believe, in love3Embed
