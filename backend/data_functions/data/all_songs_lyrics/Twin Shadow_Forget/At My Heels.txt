At My Heels LyricsI'm in the belly of the canyon
I can't come up with any reason
Why a ghost is following me
Why a ghost is following me
I got some feed for the longing
I got the pillow for the bad dreams
The apparition dancing with me
Stepping down all over my feet
There is no key to my gate
But you can still come around
Lean your ladder against my window
And I'll come down, I'll come down
Sometimes I don't know what I am seeing
Who's keeping track of all that's breathing?
Theres a world thats waiting for me
Theres a world thats waiting for me
I'm in the belly of the canyon
I can't come up with any reasons
Why a ghost is following me
Why a ghost is following me
There is no key to my gate
But you can still come around
Lean your ladder against my window
And I'll come down, I'll come down
There is no key to my gate
But you can still come around
Lean your ladder against my window
And I'll come down, I'll come downEmbed
