Make War LyricsOur love is dead but without limit
Like the surface of the moon
Or the land between here and the mountains
Well, it is not these hiding places
That have kept us innocent
But the way you taught me to just let it all go by
And so we've learned to be as faithless
Stand behind bulletproof glass
Exchanging our affections through a drawer
And it was always horribly convenient and happening too fast
You should count your change before you're even out the door
Yes, you should but please...
Return, return to the person that you were
And I will do the same
'Cause it is too hard to belong to someone who is gone
My compass spins, the wilderness remains
Once too often, I have retreated
Into the depths of my despair
I built a barricade to block you on the road
But standing there with all of my possessions
Piled higher than a house
I felt closer to you than you ever would have known
So let these tiny acts of charity
Become common ground of which to build
A monument to commemorate our time
And though, you say, you've found another
Who will surely speed you on your way
Don't let the forest grow over that path you came there by
But you will, so...
So hurry up and run to the one that you love
And blind him with your kindness
And he'll make war, old war, on who you were before
And he'll claim all that has spoiled in your heart
Well, now, I tell myself I've mended
Under these patches of blue sky
There are still a few holes that let in a little rain
And so it is crying on my shingles
My floorboards moan under my feet
The refrigerator is whining, so I've got reason to complain
But I am not gonna bless you with such compliments
Some degrading psalm of praise
Like the kind that converted you to me so long ago
Because the truth is that gossip's as good as gospel in this town
You can save face but you won't ever save your soul
And that's a fact
So hurry up and run to the one that you love
And tie him up in you likeness
And he'll become, become the prisoner I was
And know all that has spoiled in your heart
And know all that has spoiled in your heart
So hurry up and run to the one that you love
And blind him with your kindness
And he'll make war, old war, on who you were before
And he'll claim all that has spoiled in your heart
Yeah, he'll claim all that has spoiled in your heart
(So hurry up and run to the one that you love
And blind him with your kindness
And he'll make war, old war, on who you were before
And he'll claim all that has spoiled in your heart
Yeah, he'll claim all that has spoiled...)Embed
