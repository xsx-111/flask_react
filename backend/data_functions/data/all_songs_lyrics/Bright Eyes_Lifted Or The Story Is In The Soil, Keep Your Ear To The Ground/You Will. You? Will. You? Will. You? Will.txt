You Will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will LyricsWell, you say that I treat you
Like a book on a shelf
I don't take you out that often
Because I know that I completed you
And that's why you are here
That's the reason you stay here
How awful that must feel
You said you'd be my dream
I could have you every night
And if by morning I'd forgotten you
Well, no big deal, that'd be all right
Because you're the reoccuring kind
You are the reoccuring kind
You never really leave my mind
Are you the love of my lifetime
Because there's been times I've had my doubts
We were just kids when I first kissed you
In the attic of my parents' house
And I wish we were there now
I took so long to figure out
What this book has been about
Now I write when I'm away
Letters that you'll never read
You said, "Go explore those other women
The geography of their bodies
But there's just one map you'll need
You're a boomerang you'll see
You will return to me"
Well, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will
Because if you don't, then this book's all lies
If you don't, then my plans would all be ruined
If you don't, I'll start drinking like the way I drank before
And I just won't have a future anymore"1Embed
