False Advertising LyricsOn a string, on a string, on a string I was held
The way that I move, can you tell?
My actions are orchestrated from above me
And so I swing and I sway
Wave my hand, kick my leg
And it's always right with the music
Until all that swaying starts to make you sick
For a song I was bought
Now I lie when I talk
With a careful eye on the cue cards
Onto a stage, I was pushed
With my sorrow well-rehearsed
So give me all your pity and your money, now (All of it)
We used to think that sound was something pure
But if I could act like this was my real life
And not some cage where I've been placed
Well then, I could tell you the truth like I used to
And not be afraid of sounding fake
Now all anyone's listening for are the mistakes
(Oh, I'm sorry)
No, it's okay, it's okay
One two three, one two three
In a house, by myself
I hear the ice start to melt
And I'll watch rooftops weep for the sunlight
And I know what must change
Fuck my face, fuck my name
They are brief and false advertisements
For a soul I don't have
Something true I have lacked
And spent my whole life trying to make up for
But I found in a song
And in the people I love
They will lift me up out of darkness
And now my door, it stands open
I'm inviting everyone in
We're gonna laugh, we're gonna drink until the morning comes
That's what we are going to do
Come on! Come on!1Embed
