Nothing Gets Crossed Out LyricsWell, the future has got me worried, such awful thoughts
My head is a carousel of pictures
The spinning never stops
I just want someone to walk in front
And I'll follow the leader
Like when I fell under the weight of a schoolboy crush
Started carrying her books and doing lots of drugs
I almost forgot who I was
But came to my senses
Now I'm tryin' to be assertive
I'm making plans
Wanna rise to the occasion, yeah
Meet all of their demands
But all I do is just lay in bed
And hide under the covers
Yeah, I know I should be brave
But I'm just too afraid of all this change
And it's too hard to focus through all this doubt
I keep making these "To Do" lists but nothing gets crossed out
Working on the record seems pointless now
When the world ends, who's gonna hear it?
But Im tryin' and take some comfort in written words
Yeah Tim I heard your album and it's better than good
When you get off tour I think we should hang and black out together
Because I've been feeling sentimental for days gone by...
All those summers singing, drinking, laughing, wasting our time
Remember all those songs and the way we smiled
In those basements made of music
But now I've got to crawl, to get anywhere at all
I'm not as strong as I thought
So when I'm lost in a crowd
I hope that you'll pick me out
Oh, how I long to be found
The grass grew high. I laid down
Now I wait for a hand to lift me up, help me stand
I have been laying so low
Don't want to lay here no more
Don't want to lay here no more
Don't want to lay here no more
Don't want to lay here no more
But if everything that happens is supposed to be
And it is predetermined, can't change your destiny
Then I guess I'll just keep moving, someday, maybe, I'll get to where I'm going2Embed
