Laura Laurent Lyrics
Laura, are you still living there on your estate of sorrows?
You used to leave it occasionally, but now you don't even bother
To ride that commuter train west to Chicago
To stroll through the greenery in the park past the statues

How their eyes seemed to follow you like a hated addiction
Their beauty carved out of absolutes that you could never claim
Or even envision

Laura, you were the saddest song in the shape of a woman
Yeah, I thought you were beautiful but I wept with your movements
But I hope that you're laughing now from that place on the carpet
Where we shared a sleeping bag in your sister's apartment

Oh, how she would worry so, you know, I was just a stranger
But she asked me to care for you, yes she did
And I went and betrayed her

But do you know we're in high demand, Laura
Us people who suffer
Because we don't take to arguing
And we're quick to surrender
Well, I think I would call tonight if I still had your number
Your thoughts have always lain close to mine
Yeah, we were both skipping supper
But you should never be embarrassed by your trouble with living
Because it's the ones with the sorest throats, Laura
Who have done the most singing
Everybody
