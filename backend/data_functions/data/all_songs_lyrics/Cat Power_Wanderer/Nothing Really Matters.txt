Nothing Really Matters Lyrics
When I see your face in the crowd
With a look of obsession
There's no subtle way to say
There's plenty of defense and discretion
Even with what's left
All the gifts put outside
It's like nothing really matters

How can other people's ways
Be an estimate of your way of life?
Can't the words, and birds, and trees, and earth
Be the same thing, and be just as right?
It's hard, a learned test
It's so hard, a learned test
It's like nothing really matters
It's like nothing really matters

The courage to turn it around
If he could see the different way
If he could turn it on its knee and bend it down
It wouldn't really matter
But outside, a learned test
A learned testEmbed
