Wanderer Lyrics
Oh, wanderer, I've been here wondering
If your brown eyes still have color, could I see?
That night, that night with those hands, those hands
That night, that night, oh, galleon ring

With heart, wild heart, you would sing to me
Wasn't I the lady from the other town?
Twist of fate would have me sing at your wedding
With a baby on my mind and your soul in between

Wild heart, young man, goddamn, no one to keep
Your goal is ages out for the end of your story
Gave my hand to Jesus when I ran away with you
Oh, wanderer, I've been wonderingEmbed
