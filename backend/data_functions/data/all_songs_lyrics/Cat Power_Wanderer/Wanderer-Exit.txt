Wanderer/Exit Lyrics
Oh, wanderer
I'll be here wondering
If your brown eyes still have color, could I see?
That night, that night with those hands, those hands
That night, that night, oh, galleon ring

With heart, wild heart, you would sing to me
Wasn't I the lady from the other town?
Twist of fate would have me sing at your wedding
With a baby on my mind and your soul in between

Wild heart, young man, goddamn, I never wanted to keep
Your goal is ages out for the end of your story
Give my hand to Jesus when I ran away with you
Oh, wanderer
I've been wondering

Oh, wanderer
I'll be wonderingEmbed
