Robbin Hood LyricsWhen I walk from the bright side
Carrying my clothes, going back inside
Ooh, Robbin
Ooh, Robbin Hood
When I walk home outside
Don't be caught after 8, you know why
Ooh, Robbin
Ooh, Robbin Hood
Little lady on the street side
Little bitty baby in her arms so tight
Ooh, Robbin
Ooh, Robbin Hood
Big fat cat, biggest piece of the pie
High top hat, there's no disguise
Ooh, Robbin
He's robbing you
Gun to your head, they want solely your money
Rubbing my mind with all the gloves only
Ooh, Robbin
Ooh, Robbin Hood
When I walk from the bright side
Got to cover my head to my ankle or die
Ooh, Robbin
Ooh, Robbin Hood
Ooh, Robbin
Ooh, Robbin HoodEmbed
