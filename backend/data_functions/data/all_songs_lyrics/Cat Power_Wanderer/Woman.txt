Woman Lyrics
Woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman

If I had a dime for every time
Tell me I'm not what you need
If I had a quarter, I would pull it together
And I would take it to the bank and then leave
Yes, I would take it to the bank and then leave

If you know people who know me
You might want them to speak
To tell you 'bout the girl or the woman they know
More than you think you know about me
More than you think you know me
See you walkin' in circles (Circles)
See you talkin' in circles (Circles)
See your thoughts runnin' in circles
Could walk around all day long, followin' me
Doctor said I was better than ever
Man, you shoulda seen me
Doctor said I was not my past
He said I was finally free
Taking the charge (Taking the charge)
I took the lead (I took the lead)
I need you to believe

I'm a woman of my word, now haven't you heard?
My word's the only thing I've ever needed
I'm a woman of my word, now you have heard
My word's the only thing I truly need
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman

Your money's like a weapon, a tool to get me
You think I'm like the other ones
Well, my money's like a weapon, tool for me
No, I'm not like those other ones
A cage is like a weapon, a tool for me
You think I'm like the other ones
Well, my cage is a weapon, it's perfect for me
It's the one suit they seem to not see

I'm a woman of my word, now haven't you heard?
My word's the only thing I've ever needed
I'm a woman of my word, now you have heard
My word's the only thing I truly need
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman
I'm a woman, woman, woman, woman
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman
Woman, woman, woman2Embed
