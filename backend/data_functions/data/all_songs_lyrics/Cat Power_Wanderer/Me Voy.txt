Me Voy Lyrics
I am leaving
Me voy, me voy
Good is gone
I am going
Me voy, me voy
Good, good has come

Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No, oh, oh, no, oh, oh

I am leaving
Me voy, me voy
Good is gone
I am going
Me voy, me voy
Good, good has come

No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No, oh, oh, no, oh, oh
More, oh, oh
No more
Wish you could stay tomorrow
Wish you would stay
Don't go tomorrow
Don't go anywhere

I am leaving
Me voy, me voy
Good is gone
I am going
Me voy, me voy
Good, good has come

No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No, more, no, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No more

Wish you could stay tomorrow
Wish you would stay
Don't go tomorrow
Don't go anywhereEmbed
