You Get LyricsYou take-a-take, and you a-gave-gave-gave what you get
And you'll make, make, make, and you'll pretend what you forget
You never take time
No, you'll never take mine
But if you don't, you could be getting, you'll be getting again
If you don't, you will be getting, you'll be getting again
If you don't, you will be getting, you'll be getting again
And would you want? You won't be on time
You cross the street, you got the feeling on me
You never listen to reason, you just tell 'em to be
You never listen to time
You never build up the time
You never listen, you will get, you get, you get what you get
You never listen, you will get, you get, you get what you get
You never listened beyond the time
And on the street, they're all talking 'bout the things you should listen
And on the news, they're always excusing
And when you tell your friends what you think you ever
And, no, there's nothing like time
To teach you where you have been
And there is nothing like time
To give you things you can need
But when you listen to the rhythm of the movements, that's right
And you've been telling me, always tell me right
It's not nothing I know, it's just something outside
You always listen your way, but you take time
To get what you want
And you tell me it's time I am wrong
And you live in this world, and you'll get what you get
And you get what you get, and you will get what you get
But when you tell me there's another time
And when you tell me there's another time
I won't remember what you're telling me, it's time
I won't forget, I won't forget, I won't forget, it's time
It's time
You get what you get (Time)
You get what you get, you get, you get, you get what you get (Time)
And you'll know when it's time, you'll get it all on yourself (Time)
You'll get it again, you will be getting again (Time)
On time
You'll get what you get (Time)
Time, you get what you get (Time)
When you take time
You get what you get, you get what you getEmbed
