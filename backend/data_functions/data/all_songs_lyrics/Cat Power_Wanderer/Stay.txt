Stay Lyrics
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Want you to stay

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Ooh, ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
When you finally see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Want you to stay
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Ooh, ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
When you finally see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Want you to stayEmbed
