Hosanna Lyrics
Hosanna me built a house, oh
Hosanna me built a house, oh
Hosanna me built a house, oh
Hosanna me built a house, oh

House built on a weak foundation
Will not stand, oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Stories told through all creation
Will not stand, oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
House built on a weak foundation
Will not stand, oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Stories told through all creation
Will not stand, oh no

Hosanna
Rain come wash it down (Ha-ha)
Sun come burn it up (Ha-ha)
Storm come blow it down (Ha-ha)
This house could never be (Oh no)
This house could never be (Oh no)
It would be weak, you see

House built on a weak foundation
Will not stand, oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Stories told through all creation
Will not stand, oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
House built on a weak foundation
Will not stand, oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Stories told through all creation
Will not stand, oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Hosanna me built a house, oh
Hosanna me built a house, oh
Hosanna me built a house, oh
Hosanna me built a house, oh

House built on a rock foundation
It will stand, oh yes
Stories told through all creation
It will stand, oh yes
House built on a rock foundation
It will stand, oh yes
Stories told through all creation
It will stand, oh yes

Hosanna
Rain come wash on it (Ha-ha)
Sun come shine on it (Ha-ha)
Storm can't blow it down (Oh no)
This house will always be (Oh yes)
This house will always be (Oh yes)
It will be strong you see

Hosanna me built a house, oh
Hosanna me built a house, oh
Hosanna me built a house, oh
Hosanna
