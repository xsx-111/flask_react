Man Smart (Woman Smarter) Lyrics
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-hey
Hey

I say let us put man and a woman together
To find out which one is smarter
Some say man, but I say no
The women got the men beat, they should know

And not me, but the people they say
That the man are leading the women astray
But I say that the women of today
Smarter than the man in every way

That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, that's right

Ah, ever since the world began
Woman was always teaching man
And if you listen to my bid attentively
I goin' tell you how she smarter than me
And not me, but the people they say
That the man are leading the women astray
But I say that the women of today
Smarter than the man in every way

Samson was the strongest man long ago
No one could a-beat him, as we all know
Until he clash with Deliah on top of the bed
She told him all the strength was in the hair of his head

And not me, but the people they say
That the man are leading the women astray
But I say that the women of today
Smarter than the man in every way

That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, that's right

Hey, you meet a girl at a pretty dance
Thinkin' that you would stand a chance
Take her home, thinkin' she's alone
Open de door
You find her husband home
Not me, but the people they say
That the man are leading the women astray
But I say that the women of today
Smarter than the man in every way

That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, that's right

I was treatin' a girl independently
She was makin' baby for me
When de baby born and I went to see
Eyes was blue
It was not by me

And not me, but the people they say
That the man are leading the women astray
But I say that the women of today
Smarter than the man in every way

Oh, yes, smarter1Embed
