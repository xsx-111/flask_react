Will His Love Be Like His Rum? Lyrics
Will his love be like his rum?
Yes it will, yes it will
Intoxicating all night long
Yes it will, yes it will
Everybody

Drink, drink this toast
Drink this wedding toast
Drink, oh drink this toast
To the two we love the most

Did he wed her in the spring?
Yes he did, yes he did
Did he give her finger ring?
Yes he did, yes he did
Everybody

Drink, drink this toast
Drink this wedding toast
Drink, oh drink this toast
To the two we love the most
Will her cooking be the best?
Yes it will, yes it will
Make his belly split his vest?
Yes it will, yes it will
Everybody

Drink, drink this toast
Drink this wedding toast
Drink, oh drink this toast
To the two we love the most

Will she be a perfect wife?
Yes she will, yes she will
Make him work hard all his life?
Yes she will, yes she will
Everybody

Drink, drink this toast
Drink this wedding toast
Drink, oh drink this toast
To the two we love the most
Will his love be like his rum?
Yes it will, yes it will
Intoxicating all night long
Yes it will, yes it will
Everybody

Drink, drink this toast
Drink this wedding toast
Drink, oh drink this toast
To the two we love the most

Will we dance and sing all night-a?
Yes we will, yes we will
Eat up everything in sight?
Yes we will, yes we will
Everybody

Drink, drink this toast
Drink this wedding toast
Drink, oh drink this toast
To the two we love the most
Once again, now
Drink, drink this toast
Drink this wedding toast
Drink, drink, drink, drink
To the two we love the mostEmbed
