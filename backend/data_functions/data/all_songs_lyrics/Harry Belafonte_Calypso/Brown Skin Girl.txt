Brown Skin Girl Lyrics
Everything to keep me from sleepin'
A lot of sailor boys, they were leavin'
And everybody there, they were jumpin'
To hear the sailor boys in our chorus singin'

"Ah de brown skin girl, stay home and mind, baby
Brown skin girl, stay home and mind, baby"
I'm goin' away in a sailing boat
And if I don't come back
Stay home and mind, baby

Now the Americans made an invasion
We thought it was a help to the island
Until they left from here on vacation
They left the native boy home to mind their children

Singin', "Brown skin girl, stay home and mind, baby
Brown skin girl, stay home and mind, baby"
I'm goin' away in a sailing boat
And if I don't come back
Stay home and mind, baby
Now I tell you de story 'bout Millie
She made a nice blue-eyed baby
They say she fancy the mother
But the blue-eyed baby ain't know she father

Now the Americans all have their pleasure
While the music played to their leisure
And everybody there they were jumpin'
To hear the sailor boys in our chorus singin'

"Ah de brown skin girl, stay home and mind, baby
Brown skin girl, stay home and mind, baby"
I'm goin' away in a sailing boat
And if I don't come back
Stay home and mind, baby
"Brown skin girl, stay home and mind, baby
Brown skin girl, stay home and mind, baby"
I'm goin' away in a sailing boat
And if I don't come back
Stay home and mind, babyEmbed
