I Do Adore Her Lyrics
When shadows fall and stars appear
A pain I feel I cannot bear
If I could relive that faithful day
I would not turn my love away

I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her

When I think of her tender lips
Gentle touch of her fingertips
Reminisce on her eyes so fair
Moonlight soft on her downy hair

I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her
If some day I should see her smile
Hold her hand and me heart beguile
Feel her warmth in her earnest prayer
Darling, shield me from all despair

I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her

Now I'm standing alone and sad
Thinkin' upon the joys I've had
Time makes fools of men they say
Take me back to that distant day

I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour herEmbed
