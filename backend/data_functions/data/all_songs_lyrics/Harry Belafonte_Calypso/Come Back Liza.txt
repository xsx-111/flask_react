Come Back Liza Lyrics
Every time I'm away from Liza
Water come to me eye
Every time I'm away from Liza
Water come to me eye

Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye

I remember when love was new
Water come to me eye
There was one, but now there's two
Water come to me eye

Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye

When the evening starts to fall
Water come to me eye
I need to hear my Liza's call
Water come to me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye

Standing there in the marketplace
Water come to me eye
Soon I'll feel her warm embrace
Water come to me eye

Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye

In the shadow I stand a while
Water come to me eye
Soon I'll see my Liza's smile
Water come to me eye

Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Every time I'm away from Liza
Water come to me eye
Every time I'm away from Liza
Water come to me eye

Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eyeEmbed
