The Jack-Ass Song LyricsPlay that ting, man
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
I say the jackass will jump and bray
Lordy, let him bray, let him bray, everybody
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Now I tell you in a positive way
Don't tie me donkey down there
'Cause me donkey will rump and play
Don't tie me donkey down there
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Once again, now
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Now me donkey gone mad they say
Don't tie me donkey down there
'Cause his eye on a bale o' hay
Don't tie me donkey down there
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Now the news really travel fast
Don't tie me donkey down there
When me donkey in the meadow grass
Don't tie me donkey down there, ha
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Around the corner
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Ah, play that ting, man
One more time now
Now me heart is light and gay
Don't tie me donkey down there
He-haw 'til judgment day
Don't tie me donkey down there, ha
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Once again now
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Around the corner
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Once again now
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
Down the road nowEmbed
