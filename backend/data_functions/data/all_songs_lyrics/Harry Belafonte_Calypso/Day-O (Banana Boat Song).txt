Day-O (Banana Boat Song) LyricsDay-o, day-ay-ay-o
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day-ay-ay-o
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Work all night on a drink a rum
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Stack banana 'til the mornin' come
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Come, mister tally man, tally me banana
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Come, mister tally man, tally me banana
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Lift six foot, seven foot, eight foot, bunch
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot, bunch
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Day, me say day-ay-ay-o
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
A beautiful bunch of ripe banana
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Hide the deadly black tarantula
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Lift six foot, seven foot, eight foot, bunch
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot, bunch
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Day, me say day-ay-ay-o
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Come, mister tally man, tally me banana
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Come, mister tally man, tally me banana
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Day-o, day-ay-ay-o
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day-ay-ay-o
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)14Embed
