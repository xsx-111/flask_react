Dolly Dawn Lyrics
Hoo-ooh!
Look, look at Dolly
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, dolly
Oh, here she come, here she come, here she come
Pretty, pretty Dolly

When Dolly hear them sound the drum
Up, she jump and she holler: "Here I Come"
When Dolly hear them sound the drum
Up, she jump and she holler: "Here I Come"

'Cause she gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring

Don't stop her when she hear the call
Dolly Dawn goin' to have herself a ball
Don't stop her when she hear the call
Dolly Dawn goin' to have herself a ball
'Cause she gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring

When Dolly start to shake and shout
Clear the floor 'cause she really move about
When Dolly start to shake and shout
Clear the floor 'cause she really move about

'Cause she gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
When Dolly go into a turn
All men jump and their eyes begin to burn
When Dolly go into a turn
All men jump and their eyes begin to burn

'Cause she gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring

Soon Dolly go into a fall
Turn an' spin then she starts to climb the wall
Soon Dolly go into a fall
Turn an' spin and then she climb the wall

'Cause she gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
She gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ringEmbed
