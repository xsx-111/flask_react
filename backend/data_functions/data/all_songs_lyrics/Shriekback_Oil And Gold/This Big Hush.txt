This Big Hush Lyrics
Is there a fire in the sky?
Is there a moon up there?
Is there anything alive now?
This darkness is what I hear
This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The telltale signs are in your eyes

More than I can hold in my hands
Running through the gaps like water
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire, the ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside and the light from you

Is there a flame in the dark?
Is there a bright hard star?
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are
We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep wherever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all
Holding up on animal fear
Soaking up the waves underwater
Turned to music no one can hear
Forever in this half light
All desire, the ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside and the light from you
All desire, the ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside and the light from you
More than I can hold in my hands
Running through the gaps like water
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire, the ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
All desire, the ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
Turning this night inside
Turning this night inside and the light from youEmbed
