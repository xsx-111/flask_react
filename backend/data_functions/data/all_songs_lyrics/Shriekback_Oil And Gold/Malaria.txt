Malaria Lyrics
In the dumb fat side
Of the heavy sweaty black malaria night
You can tell the shit
From the essence of heaven
In the smash and grab
In the sharp attack dishonest night
You can say what you want
And somebody listen
There's laughter and glass
And perfume and flags
And kisses and trains
And roses and vaccines

I'm living in a neon house
I'm living in avalanche road
I'm living in hangover city
I'm living in a neon house
I'm living in avalanche road
I'm living in hangover city

Whatever gets you acclimatised
Radiation and downcast eyes serious sight
We're looking for a wild machine
Cybernetic rabies
Syndication and sympathy
Might work for you but not for me
I love you best when it's all a mess
Will you lie for me, cry for me
Die for me will you please
Never, never, never, never
Never, never, never say no
I'm living in a neon house
I'm living in avalanche road
I'm living in hangover city
I'm living in a neon house
I'm living in avalanche road
I'm living in hangover city
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning

In the dumb fat side
Of the heavy sweaty black malaria night
You can say what you want
Somebody listen
Gonna say what I really want
(Come on say what you really want)
Gonna say what I really want
(Yeah, say what you really want)
I wanna live with Halo Jones
I wanna home that's miles from home
I wanna drugs from the Twilight Zone
I wanna never never never never
Never never never say no
I'm living in a neon house
I'm living in avalanche road
I'm living in hangover city
I'm living in a neon house
I'm living in avalanche road
I'm living in hangover city
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burning
And all these unforeseen things tumble down
I've got a love and it won't stop burningEmbed
