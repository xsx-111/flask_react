Health and Knowledge and Wealth and Power Lyrics
Out of the same back door into the same back yard again
Over the same low wall into the same long car and then
Black wheels on a silver car, big wheels go round
Panoramic as the open sea, big waves crash down
Out of the same back door across the same back yard again
Over the same low wall into the same long car and then
Touch down in a different place, wide eyes look round
On the devil and the deep blue sea, one sun beats down

Health and knowledge and wealth and power
Passion and poems and sex
I wear a smile like a leather glove
I won't shut my mouth for less

Out of the same back door across the same back yard again
Over the same low wall into the same long car and then
Black wheels on a silver car, big wheels go round
Panoramic like the open sea, big waves crash down

Health and knowledge and wealth and power
Passion and poems and sex
I wear a smile like a leather glove
I won't shut my mouth for less
Belts and buckles and zips and chains
My sign, my style, my dress
My heart was made to steal
It's heaven, more or less

Touch down in a different place, wide eyes look round
On the devil and the deep blue sea, one sun beats down

Health and knowledge and wealth and power
Passion and poems and sex
I wear a smile like a leather glove
I won't shut my mouth for less
Health and knowledge and wealth and power
Passion and poems and sex
I wear a smile like a leather glove
I won't shut my mouth for less2Embed
