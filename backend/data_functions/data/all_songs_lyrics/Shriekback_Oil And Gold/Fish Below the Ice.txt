Fish Below the Ice Lyrics
Well, the mouth is open and the noise comes out
Ain't no reason for it, just a need to shout
It's malnutrition, we could fall apart
It's never delicate, just something from the iron age

We shake it up and we break it down
The sound of a satellite saying, "Get me down"
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
Hear the voice of America in your home town

Well, the film is running till the film runs out
There's no point of focus, it zooms in and out
It's information and it leaves no mark
It's just as permanent as painting in the iron age
I'm plugged in and loaded
Don't forget to phone in
The self destruct is holding
I'm counting, I'm counting but only to three

We get it right sometimes, we shine a light sometimes
We see the fish below the ice sometimes
Stand up and fight sometimes, we get the fright sometimes
How will we ever pay the price this time?
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
The sound of a satellite saying, "Get me down"
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
It's east European, west European
It's moving so fast, it goes all the way round
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
(He's on a mission from god but he don't know whose and he don't know why)
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
(Says I'm not a light in the darkness)
(More like a shadow on the lungs)
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
(I'm balanced here on the edge of anger)
(I'm standing here on an empty page)
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
(Sooner or later they'll start receiving)
(I've been standing here for days)
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
Hear the voice of America in your home town
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
It's east European, west European
It's moving so fast, it goes all the way round
We get it right sometimes, we shine a light sometimes
We see the fish below the ice sometimes
Stand up and fight sometimes, we get the fright sometimes
How will we ever pay the price this time?

Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
The sound of a satellite saying, "Get me down"
Yeah, we shake it up and we break it down
It's east European, west European
It's moving so fast, it goes all the way round

We get it right sometimes, we shine a light sometimes
We see the fish below the ice sometimes
Stand up and fight sometimes, we get the fright sometimes
How will we ever pay the price this time?
We get it right sometimes, we shine a light sometimes
We see the fish below the ice sometimes
Stand up and fight sometimes, we get the fright sometimes
How will we ever pay the price this time?
We get it right sometimes, we shine a light sometimes
We see the fish below the ice sometimes
Stand up and fight sometimes, we get the fright sometimes
How will we ever pay the price this time?Embed
