Everything That Rises Must Converge Lyrics
Honour among thieves, my crackling clothes
They cover me like leaves
Roll up a sleeve and hold my hand
She's saying I, ai no corrida
Kick up the soil, spoil a pattern in the sand
He's saying me, I don't believe you
But then he can't tell the water from the land

And it's blue blue blue
A colour and a surge
Everything that rises must converge
She says one day soon
You and I will merge
Everything that rises must converge

Nothing is for free the story goes
You hear it and believe
Now don't you grieve or look behind
He's saying why, why do we do this?
This is the very thing that's preying on his mind
And she don't know which way to go
She says, if you find it darling let me know
And he says well, this could be so
Says I'm a car crash, now tell me baby does it show
And it's blue blue blue
A colour and a surge
Everything that rises must converge
She says one day soon
You and I will merge
Everything that rises must converge
Yeah blue blue blue
A colour and a surge
Everything that rises must converge
She say one day soon
You and I will merge
Everything that rises must converge
Oh she don't know which way to go
And she says if you find it darling let me know
And he says well, this could be so
Says I'm a car crash, so tell me baby does it show
Yeah blue blue blue
A colour and a surge
Everything that rises must converge
And she says one day soon
You and I will merge
Everything that rises must converge
Yeah blue blue blue
A colour and a surge
Everything that rises must converge
She say one day soon
You and I will merge
Everything that rises must converge
And it's blue blue blue
A colour and a surge
Everything that rises must converge
She say one day soon
You and I will merge
Everything that rises must converge
Yeah blue blue blue
A colour and a surge
Everything that rises must converge
She say one day soon
You and I will merge
Everything that rises must converge
Yeah blue blue blue
A colour and a surge
Everything that rises must converge
She say one day soon
You and I will merge
Everything that rises must converge2Embed
