Only Thing That Shines Lyrics
Night night
Blow out the candle
Inside a blazing building
Upon a sacred mission
All the lights that twinkle
All the pens that sign
All the wishes that sink
Making up our minds
Up the wooden stairs
Up into my heart
I know that you know
This is all that matters
I feel our two young deaths so close now
Smiling soft and shiny
The blade is sharp and fine
It could just slit us open

And you know
This is nothing special
With one slip
And we could lose ourselves forever
One time for all times
And you are
The only thing that shines
The only thing that shines
Nowhere near
Wading a lake of silence
Only say that word and I will
Pour myself like wine
This is as much as I know
This is all they told me
All wicked shapes and lines
Taking us somewhere

And you know
This is nothing special
With one slip
We could lose ourselves forever
One time for all times
And you are
The only thing that shines
The only thing that shines
The only thing that shinesEmbed
