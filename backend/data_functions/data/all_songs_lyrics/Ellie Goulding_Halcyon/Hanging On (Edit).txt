Hanging On (Edit) Lyrics
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away

No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me

Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
'Cause I don't want to be a ball and chain

No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me1Embed
