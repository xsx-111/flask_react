Atlantis Lyrics
This is new, feels unused
I've never met anyone like you
Frightening, feeling naked
Sensing, searching, something sacred

I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll look for you maybe

Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?

I'm exhausted with loving
No fight in me; I'm defeated
I know I'm fooled, I can't help it
You make my heart so helpless

I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll look for you, for you maybe
I'll forget you not... I'll forget you not
I'll look for you maybe
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?6Embed
