I Know You Care Lyrics
Clinging to me
Like a last breath you would breathe
You were like home to me
I don't recognize the street
Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
Outside the cars speed by
I'd never heard them until now

I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there's trouble ahead, I can feel it
You are just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way that you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
And I know you care

I used to run down the stairs
To the door when I thought you were there
Do you shape through the comfort of us
Two lovers locked out of love
Oh, but I know you care
I know it has always been there
But there's trouble ahead, I can feel it
You are just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way that you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin

I know it wasn't always wrong
But I've never known a winter so cold
Now I don't warm my hands in your coat
But I still hope
'cause this is how things ought to have been
And I know the worst of it wasn't all that it seemed
Why can't I dream?
And why can't I dream?

Because I know you care
And I know you care
I know you care
I know you care
I know it's always been there16Embed
