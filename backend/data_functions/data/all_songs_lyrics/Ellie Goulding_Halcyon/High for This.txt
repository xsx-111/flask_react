High for This Lyrics
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes
Lay yourself beside me
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone we don't need attention

Open your hand
Take a glass
Don't be scared
I'm right here
Even though you don't roll
Trust me, boy
You wanna be high for this

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Take it off
You want it off
'Cause I know what you're feeling
It's ok
Boy, I feel it too
Let it be
Baby, breathe
I swear I am right here
We'll be good
I promise we'll be so good

Oh, open your hand
Take a glass
Don't be scared
I'm right here
Even though you don't roll
Trust me, boy
You wanna be high for this

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh4Embed
