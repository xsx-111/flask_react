Figure 8 Lyrics
Yeah yeah

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Take it all away

Breathe your smoke into my lungs
In the back of the car with you I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away (-way, -way)
And then you take it all away (-way, -way, -way, -way)

Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me, I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
I chase your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away (-way, -way)
And then you take it all away (-way, -way, -way, -way)

So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
I chase your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away (-way, -way -way, -way, -way, -way)
And then you take it all away (-way, -way, -way, -way)14Embed
