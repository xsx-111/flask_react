Dead In the Water Lyrics
If I was not myself
And you were someone else
I'd say so much to you
And I would tell the truth
'Cause I can hardly breathe
When your hands let go of me
The ice is thinning out
And my feet brace themselves

I'm there in the water
Still looking for you
I'm there in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

You've seen this all before
A life left on the shore
We're smiling all the same
You sail away again

I'm there in the water
Still looking for you
I'm there in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

(Oh, yeah, I'm dead)
Dead in the water
(I'm dead in the water)
Still looking for you
(Oh, still looking for you, for you)
I'm dead in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
I'm dead in the water
Still looking for you
I'm dead in the water
Can't you see?

I'm dead in the water
Still looking for you
I'm dead in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?8Embed
