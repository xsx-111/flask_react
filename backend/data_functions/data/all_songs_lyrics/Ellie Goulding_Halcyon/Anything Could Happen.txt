Anything Could Happen Lyrics
Stripped to the waist we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

Yes, since we found out
Since we found out

That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could
After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought "that's just what humans do"
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its color
But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could
Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

Stripped to the waist we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over
Yes, since we found out
Since we found out

That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be, oh

But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you37Embed
