The Ending Lyrics
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out

I’m living on the wild side
I’ve never seen a footprint
In the land of rivers
You’re my only bridge
And I feel the fear in me
And I don’t want to fall asleep
When I turn into someone else
I know that it gives me peace
 
 
Will you know who I am?
Will you know who you are?

I think I’ve been praying
The lights won’t go out
My blood is getting colder
As I follow this road down
 
If you lock me out (There won’t be anything to hold)
If you lock me out (There won’t be anything to hold on to)
If you lock me out (There won’t be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out (There won’t be anyone in the ending)Embed
