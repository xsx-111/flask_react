Noc-a-Homa Lyrics
Lonely tipi set in the sky
Dancing circles on a summer night
Children laughing at his expense
Chucking more peanuts at a broken man
He'll keep waving Tomahawk in hand
His headdress is a flower
He ain't no stinking coward
I wish other people can see

Noc-A-Homa
Noc-A-Homa
Noc-A-Homa
Just like you and me

Everybody's leaving and the lights are on
He's got nowhere to lie when the crowd dissolves
He's just trying to root for the team
He's a one man tribe and a dying breed
And if you stab at him, well he'll surely be
His headdress is a flower
He ain't no stinking coward
I wish other people can see
Noc-A-Homa
Noc-A-Homa
Noc-A-Homa
Just like you and me
Noc-A-Homa
Noc-A-Homa
Noc-A-Homa
Just like you and meEmbed
