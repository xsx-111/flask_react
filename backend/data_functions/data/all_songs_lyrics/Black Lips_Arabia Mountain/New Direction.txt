New Direction Lyrics
Going on a vision quest
Surf the mountain, ride the crest
I've been looking in a new direction
Starting down, I'm getting in store
The world is clear from upper cores
I've been looking in a new direction

I wanna laugh and I wanna cry
I wanna spit but my mouth's too dry
I wanna run
But I'm scared that my legs won't go
Where did they go?

Now and then, I'm like a black bird
Setting in and giving cracker
I've been looking in a new direction
Face the mirror, start to change
I'm paranoid and feeling strange
I've been looking in a new direction

I wanna laugh and I wanna cry
I wanna spit but my mouth's too dry
I wanna run
But I'm scared that my legs won't go
Where did they go?
Living in a fantasy
I walk around and lucid dream
I've been looking in a new direction
The day has past, the moon's aglow
I've lie awake, my eyes are closed
I've been looking in a new direction

I've been looking in a new direction
I've been looking in a new direction
I've been looking in a new directionEmbed
