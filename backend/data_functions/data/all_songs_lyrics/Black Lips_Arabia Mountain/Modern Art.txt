Modern Art Lyrics
K-Hole at the Dal√≠
Seeing the unknown
Well I might have been on molly
Because my mind's being blown
Take the escalator to the next floor
Such a strong sedater, now I can't find the door

You turn around
And you don't know where you been
And you look up at the glass dome
And the room begins to spin
Let's go out and find the ocean
Cause I think we need a swim
Turn around, start it over, let's begin

Like the Minis at the Louvre
Spinning down the aisles
And the paintings start to move, got me feelin' really smart
Like a 3D picture, stereoscope
It's a total light picture, kaleidoscope

At the K-Hole at the Dali
Seeing the unknown
Well I might have been on molly
Because my mind's being blown
