Time LyricsTime is moving on
But you keep on crying
Crying oh so long
But I keep on moving, moving, moving right along
When you see me walking by her side
Don't give no dirty looks
You can know you can be my bride
But I'll just remove your hooks
So what your thinking can't be true
So you keep that in mind
Time is moving on
But you keep on crying
Crying oh so long
But I keep on moving, moving, moving right along
When I'm passing down the back of school
The teacher's start to kneel
They try to play me for a fool
But they can go to hell
So what they're saying can't be true
So you keep that in mind
Time is moving on
But you keep on crying
Crying oh so long
But I keep on moving, moving, moving right along
On the highway going 91 while the cops are catching a snooze
Never thought we'd have so much fun just skipping and sipping the booze
Rocking goes away if you make it
So you keep that in mind
Time is moving on
But you keep on crying
Crying oh so long
But I keep on moving, moving, moving right along
Time (is moving on)
Time (is moving on)
Time (is moving on)
Time (is moving on)Embed
