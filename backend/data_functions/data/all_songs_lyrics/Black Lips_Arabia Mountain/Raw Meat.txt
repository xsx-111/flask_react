Raw Meat Lyrics

Raw oysters, Texas Pete
Sea urchin on the reef
Sour cheeseburger bit to eat
Lick butter goes with keef
Into the cocoa leaf
Fresh maggots on my teeth, they're cheap

Oh baby!
Oh baby!

Sweet bread's my favorite treat
Fresh lactaid from my teeth
And surely it's right and meat and cheap
Fresh onions on my leaf
Horse radish with horse meat
Sea urchin, ocean skeet to you
