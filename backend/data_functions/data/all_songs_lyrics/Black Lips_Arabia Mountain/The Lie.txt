The Lie Lyrics
Demon goddess divide the earth
Sent evil armies to fulfill the world
With burning flames and cursing eyes
Sedating you with salacious lies
Leaving burns with acid bath
Through pregnant snow, now leaving fatter
To the great beyond fall from my side
You can cast aside to win the part of my all

That's what you told me, that's what you told me
That's what you told me, so what am I going to do?
That's what you told me, that's what you told me
That's what you told me now I know it's all about you
That's what you told me, that's what you told me
That's what you told me now I'm damned to see it
And now I'm damned
I'm damned to see it too

Eternity is where I'll be
Forever now, for all to see
From down  and living hell
I'm upside down, fall through the well
Through that is much to pay for me
So shoot yourself through prophecies
I'll be back in a different form
To reap what's mine, to lead the born beyond

That's what you told me, that's what you told me
That's what you told me so what am I gonna do?
That's what you told me, that's what you told me
That's what you told me now I know it's all about you
That's what you told me, that's what you told me
That's what you told me now I'm damned to see it
And now I'm damned
I'm damned to see it tooEmbed
