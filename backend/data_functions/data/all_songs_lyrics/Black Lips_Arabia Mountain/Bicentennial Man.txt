Bicentennial Man LyricsI see you lookin'
But I never see you smile
Too bad it's that way
And we'll never reconcile
So this is the problem
I think it's plain to see
Just a modern woman
I'm just a modern me
Well the mind's always happenin', doing what they can
Well what can you expect from a bicentennial man?
I said the mind's always happenin', doing what they can
Well what can you expect from this bicentennial man?
If I had a penny, two cents I'd give to you
Then I'd want to be there
And you'd get what worth is due
If you try to test me
I think it's plain to see
You'll be a modern woman
I'll be a modern me
Well the mind's always happenin', doing what they can
Well what can you expect from a bicentennial man?
I said the mind's always happenin', doing what they can
Well what can you expect from this bicentennial man?Embed
