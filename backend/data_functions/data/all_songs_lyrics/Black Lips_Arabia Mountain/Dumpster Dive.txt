Dumpster Dive Lyrics
Woke up where the sunshine bleeds
Looking in a garbage bin
And I ain't seen some good trash
Since I, since I don't know when
Since I don't know when

I went out dumpster diving
Found some dirt painted gold
I kept some dusty silver
All covered up in mold
I dived in dusty diamonds
All crumbly and old
I took some sancrest jewelry
And dumped it in a hole


Woke up where the sunshine bleeds
Looking in a garbage bin
And I ain't seen some good trash
Since I, since I don't know when
Since I don't know when
I went out dumpster diving
Found some dirt painted gold
I kept some dusty silver
All covered up in mold
I dived in dusty diamonds
All crumbly and old
I took some sancrest jewelry
And dumped it in a holeEmbed
