Family Tree Lyrics
It feels so cold
Walk with me
It feels so cold
Down by the family tree
It feels so cold
Walk with me
Feels so cold
Down by the family tree
Oh my God!

Can I take you down
Come on out with me
Can I take you out
Out to the family tree
Can I take you out
Come on out with me
Can I take you out
Out to the family tree

Well it is so cold
Come with me
Looks so old
Down by the family tree
Well it looks so old
Come with me
Looks so old
Down by the family tree
Oh my God!
