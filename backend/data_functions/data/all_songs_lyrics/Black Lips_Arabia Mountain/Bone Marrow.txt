Bone Marrow Lyrics
She be sucking marrow
Out of your bone tomorrow
Well she tip toe out and clipped into another moon
She’ll trip you up, you stumble
And now your worlds gonna crumble
Like a like's armageddon in a time of doom
I said she pick up the pile
She’s likely heading out of style
When it’s for the win rolling you can let it loose
But you're better than that
Now don't let her get the best of you


You could have had her but you blew it dude
Can’t get the two bit if you never try
You’re on your own now buddy
And her and her silly puddy
Cus’ only a mad dog sit around and cry

She be sucking marrow
Out of your bone tomorrow
Well she tip toe out and clipped into another moon
She’ll trip you up, you stumble
And now your worlds gonna crumble
Like a like's armageddon in a time of doom
I said she pick up the pile
She’s likely heading out of style
When it’s for the win rolling you can let it loose
But you're better than that
Now don't let her get the best of youEmbed
