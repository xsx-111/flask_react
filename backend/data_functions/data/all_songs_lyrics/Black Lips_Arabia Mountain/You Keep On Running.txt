You Keep On Running Lyrics
You keep on running
You try and try
You better keep moving
'Cause there's nowhere to hide

Why I never
Hand it over, blue-eyed devil
A daddy rolled the fuck up
They said they'd all be a rebel
A crop rotten
Mother nature's terrorist 
A cracker bite
Cropping back in civil war



She was over there
 valium
She's got us always smiling
Face that was valiant
She's got the blood of a dungaree or a medallion
And it was magical,  stallion

'Cause there's nowhere to hide
'Cause there's nowhere to hide
'Cause there's nowhere to hide
'Cause there's nowhere to hideEmbed
