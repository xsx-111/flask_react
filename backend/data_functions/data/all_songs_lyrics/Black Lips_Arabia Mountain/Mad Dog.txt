Mad Dog Lyrics
Listen to it closely cause it's scary
And you might get confused
Choose your message wisely
Cause it just might be the last thing you do
Counter-clock wise, open your eyes
Play it backwards, spin it faster
God lived like a devil dog
A goddamn mad, mad dog

You're a lie, mad dog
You're a lie, mad dog

Speaking in tongues
Got the demons who's spitting up blood
Out from the speakers
You shake and you gettin' a buzz
Drop the needle, you'll discover
Judas Priest said, "Kill your mother"
God lived like a devil dog
A goddamn mad, mad dog
You're a lie, mad dog
You're a lie, mad dog

Listen to it closely cause it's scary
And you might get confused
Choose your message wisely
Cause it just might be the last thing you do
Counter-clock wise, open your eyes
Play it backwards, spin it faster
God lived like a devil dog
A goddamn mad, mad dog
You're a lieEmbed
