Always and Never Lyrics
If beauty sits the child's kiss
Of laughter I amend
Can you catch her if she runs?
With this I would share with you
All of this count to no end

Behind your sealed eyes you miss
All that I've done for you
Will you catch me when I run?
If timing plays evident
What would you say when you're late?

Stay with me and fall asleep
Pray to God for no bad dreams
Stay with me and fall asleep
Pray to God for no bad dreams

Here, I'm still waiting here, my dear
For one kiss from you
So here, I'm still waiting here, my dear
To kill all of you
To kill all of youEmbed
