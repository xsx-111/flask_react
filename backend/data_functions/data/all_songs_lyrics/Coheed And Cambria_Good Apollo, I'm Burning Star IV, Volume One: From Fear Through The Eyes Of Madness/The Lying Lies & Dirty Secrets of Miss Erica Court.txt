The Lying Lies & Dirty Secrets of Miss Erica Court Lyrics
They move too fast to be words behind your teeth
With the give and go of most of your memories
But I'm not the one that they need pray for
If I've got it all, then what does do?
Oh, leave it alone
Oh, that once little boy we used to know
Are you willing... well?

Help!
Oh, now off to the hell your god has sold
To find that never again will you rely
On the word of your friends, in the unwritten end
For when you go, they won't be following
Now, sell all your friends for the unwritten end
'Cause when you go, they won't be following him

I'll move the knife to show you of my cut
With the worst of truth, from here, I drew no blood
So you're not as real, just what I thought up?
You're just a page I'll burn from book
That has nothing to show
Of that once little boy we used to know
Am I killing you?

Help!
Oh, now off to the hell your God has sold
To find, that never again will you rely
On the word of your friends in the unwritten end
For when you go, they won't be following
Now, sell all your friends for the unwritten end
'Cause when you go, they won't be following
No, no
I said "When you go, they won't be following"
Whoa, no
I said "When you go, they won't be following him"

Believe it or not, you'll know
When this ends and how it goes
Believer, believe it or not, you'll know
When it ends and how it goesEmbed
