The Willing Well IV: The Final Cut Lyrics
In the final curtain call, you left me here with
The coldest of feelings, weight, kind, depression
Blessing the floor with the places you stepped in
But will they ever measure up to the way you left me?
Here, by the roadside, the bloodiest cadaver
Marked in your words, I'm the joke, I'm the bastard
Here, wait, so I guess that you knew, that you're
A selfish little whore, I'm the selfish little whore
If I had my way, I'd crush your face in the door

This is no beginning, yeah, yeah
This is the final cut, open up
This is no beginning, yeah, yeah
This is the final cut, I'm in love
