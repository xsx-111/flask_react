Wake Up Lyrics
I'm gonna ride this plane out of your life again
I wish that I could stay, but you argue
More than this, I wish you could've seen my face
In backseat, staring out the window
I'll do anything for you
Kill anyone for you

So leave yourself intact
'Cause I will be coming back
In a phrase to cut these lips
I love you

The morning will come
In the press of every kiss, with your head upon my chest
Where I will annoy you
With every waking breath, until you decide to wake up

I've earned through hope and faith
On the curves around your face
That I'm the one you'll hold, forever
If morning never comes for either one of us
Then this, I pray to you, wherever
I'll do anything for you, this story is for you
('Cause I'd do anything you want me to, for you)
I'll do anything for you, kill anyone for you

So leave yourself intact
'Cause I won't be coming back
In a phrase to cut these lips
I loved you

The morning will come
In the press of every kiss, with your head upon my chest
Where I will annoy you
With every waking breath, until you decide to wake up
The morning will come
In the press of every kiss, with your head upon my chest
Where I will annoy you
With every waking breath, 'til you decide to wake upEmbed
