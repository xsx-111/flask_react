Once Upon Your Dead Body Lyrics
If hello could only drop its 'O'
And it stayed in the front door's way
Of your home, would you live there still?
Could that make you everything I hate?
Wait...

Do you remember why you did it? (No, I don't)
Do you remember why she left?

No, I hope you die, right now
Will you drink my chemical?

Is there price to burn this paradise?
Where you left all parts that hurt to mend
If I don't stay await, will she come here again
For my wish of only one last kiss?

Do you remember why you did it? (No, I don't)
Do you remember why she left?
(Unless you did what you thought would befriend)
Do you remember why you did it?
Do you remember why she left?
No, I hope you die, right now
Will you drink my chemical?
Oh, and if you cry out loud
It'll only make me feel too good
Whoa, I hope you die, right now
Will you drink my chemical?
Oh, and if you cry out loud
It'll only make me feel too good
Oh, I hope you die, right now
Will you drink my chemical?
Oh, and if you cry out loud
It'll only make me feel too good

(Once upon your, once upon your)
I hope you die, right now
(Once upon your dead body)
It'll only make me feel too good
(Once upon your, once upon your)
I hope you die, right now
(Once upon your dead body)
It'll only make me feel too good
(Once upon your, once upon your)
I hope you die, right now
(Once upon your dead body)
It'll only make me feel too good
(Once upon your, once upon your)
I hope you die, right now
(Once upon your dead body)
I hope you die, right nowEmbed
