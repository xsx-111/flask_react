Mother May I Lyrics
Did you ever really think that you'd
Expose the truth that pains the page?
And in their asking, did you see their lie
The motive, true and earnest side?
Four in the morning, should they wake up?
Or see them precious in their sleep
Every step should break the same
With every move and every need

So run, little children, play
I'll leave the light off to turn your mother on
So run, little children, play
I'll leave the light off to turn your mother on

Could you ever really wish of them
One of your games and counts of truth?
With every moment, you'll trace the doubt
And of the premise, what about?
Will they ever really see an end, or
Does it matter now, from then?
What of their love for once pronounced?
And of this love, a loss without?
So run, little children, play
I'll leave the light off to turn your mother on
So run, little children, play
I'll leave the light off to turn your mother on
I should have known...

God only knows when your word isn't pure
And the blood on your hands isn't yours
I won't believe any word that you tell
And I won't drink the blood if it spills

So give them the story they want you to
Give them the story they want
A kiss to you, girl
Before you fall down and leave me
So give them the story they want you to
Give them the story they want
A kiss to you, girl
Before you fall down and leave me
So give them the story they want you to
Before you leave me
So give them the story they want you to
Before you leave me
Give them the story they want you to
Before you leave me
So give them the story they want you to
Before you leave
God only knows when your word isn't pure
And the blood on your hands isn't yours
I won't believe any word that you tell
And I won't drink the blood if it spills
God only knows when your word isn't pure
And the blood on your hands isn't yours
I won't believe any word that you tell
And I won't drink the blood if it spills2Embed
