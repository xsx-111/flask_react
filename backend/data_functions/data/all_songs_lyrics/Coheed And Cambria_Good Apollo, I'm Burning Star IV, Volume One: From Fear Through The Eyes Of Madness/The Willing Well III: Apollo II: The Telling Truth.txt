The Willing Well III: Apollo II: The Telling Truth Lyrics
In the worst of all your fears
You have come so far to hear
That in turn, they've showered your name
As the laughing stock
Now by fire, you must hang
As my word holds course through vein
You will walk to the end of days
I'll gravitate towards you
I will, in the now, hate you
Whoa oh, whoa oh
These days are numbered, this close encounter
To the heartland, through the madness

I'll make you wish you hadn't burned our time, before
I'll live through this, in a manner cursed at my own accord
(I don't want to go)
So come on, bitch, why aren't you laughing, now?
(You left me here to fend on my own)
So cry on, bitch, why aren't you laughing, now?

In my presence
You will make sure the fiction meets its fate
That death will grace your face, my dear character
Through these lessons, you have learned
All the worlds, from here, must burn
For as God demands that the end, we miss

I'll make you wish you hadn't burned our time, before
I'll live through this, in a manner cursed at my own accord
(I don't want to go)
So come on, bitch, why aren't you laughing, now?
(You left me here to fend on my own)
So cry on, bitch, why aren't you laughing, now?

If my shame spills our worth across this floor
Then tonight, goodnight, I'm Burning Star IV
Only, I don't even think of you
No, I don't wanna think of you, anymore
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye

If then, should they come home
With failed attempt, we'll know
I won't leave a stone unturned
These worlds will surely
(Burn) Wait, wait...
Wait, wait...
Wait, wait...
Wait, wait...
Wait, wait...
Wait, wait...
But what did I do to
To deserve all of you?
Jesse, bad boy, just come look at what your brother did
To that girl's precious little whore of a body
Jesse, bad boy, just come look at what your brother did
To that girl's precious little whore of a body
Jesse, just come look at what your brother did
To that girl's precious little whore of a body, now
Jesse, just come look at what your brother did
To that girl's precious little whore of a body, now

I'll make you wish you hadn't burned our time, before
I'll live through this, in a manner cursed at my own accord
(I don't want to go)
So come on, bitch, why aren't you laughing, now?
(You left me here to fend on my own)
So cry on, bitch, why aren't you laughing, now?
If my shame spills our worth across this floor
Then tonight, goodnight, I'm Burning Star IV
Only, I don't even think of you
No, I don't wanna think of you, anymore
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye
But, I don't wanna think of you
No girl, I don't wanna think of you, anymore
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye
Goodnight, tonight, goodbyeEmbed
