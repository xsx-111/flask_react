We Gets Up Lyrics
Oh yeah, what'd you think was going to happen?
Come on!

We gets up, everybody gets down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come to your town
I said the lost is found

We gets up
Ain't no need to trip
We're the one deserving of the championship
We gets up
So you feel the gift
All the competition, they got to quit

We gets up, everybody gets down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come to your town
I said the lost is found

Yeah! How you think we coming?
Smash them like you want to sting
We just bad - we so bad, we good
Coming to wreck shop in your neighborhood
NPG - and we're making it understood
Ain't no one can stop us, how you think you could?
We gets up, everybody gets down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come to your town
I said the lost is found

Yeah, NPG, New Power Soul, K-k-k-kick it!
Oh yeah!
Give me the break, give me the break, huh
If y'all take a left, we going to go right
But we'll keep this mother rocking till the broad daylight
People, wave your hands
Ain't nobody better in all of the land
See them go ...!
Yeah, we crushing the man
That don't believe we gets up, yes we can!
We gets up, up, up, up!
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

We gets up, everybody gets down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come to your town
I said the lost is found
We gets up
We gets up
We gets up
We gets up
We gets up
(Oh yeah)
All right
We gets up!Embed
