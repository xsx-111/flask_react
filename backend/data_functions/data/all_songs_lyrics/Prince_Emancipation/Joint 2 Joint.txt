Joint 2 Joint Lyrics
If you want to we can kick it, baby, joint to joint

(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), kick it, baby, joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah

Before I melt the wax to quizzical
Let me just say that you are physically
The most toned one I've ever seen
You're making me proud to be a human be-i-ng (Uh-huh)
And if we're ever naked in the same machine
I'm gonna lick it, baby, joint to joint

(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), kick it, baby, joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah

So first I need a picture of your mother
To verify the fact that there's not another
One in the universe so supreme
Damn, you got the rock to give a brother cream (Cream)
And if we're ever naked in the same machine
I'm gonna lick it, baby, joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), joint to joint
(Sex, sex, sex me) - If you want to we can kick it, baby, joint to joint
(Sex me) - Oh yeah, I got some hot sauce, joint to joint (Ha ha ha)
(Sex me) - Said kick it baby, joint to joint (Right on, ha ha ha)
(Sex me) - Yeah (Safe)
(Come upstairs to my room)

Joint to joint
Joint to joint

I never sucked sour splints from a chew stick
Don't lick bics because fire sticks to flame (Flame)
Get wicks to catch brothers who choose to let burns remain
Now I see all Dicks, Toms ,and Harrys are not the same
Some dipped in my lower lip, sipped a supple poison (Poison, poison, poison)

Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint

Joint to joint, nothing comes for free
If you show your love, you can get with me
You can get with me, you can get with me
Joint to joint
Up the stairs to my lovely room
Stroke your face and you're under soon
Sitting in the corner in your underwear
Letting me caress yo' nappy hair
Joint to joint, nothin' comes for free
If you show your love, you can get with me
And if you light my candle, we can share the stone
Flames of desire, sweet gypsy moans
Sweet gypsy moans
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint

Joint to joint, nothing comes for free
Oh great, now you think you're my soulmate
You don't even know what kind of cereal I like
Wrong
Captain Crunch with soy milk
Because cows are for calves
You'd probably take me for half
You don't love me, you're a faker
You just want me for my acres
(Na na, na na na na)

Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint, nothing comes for free (Sex me)
If you show your love, you can get with me
(Na na, na na na na) (Nothing comes for free)
If we're ever naked in the same machine
Baby, we can kick it joint to joint

Where to?
I-- I don't know
An..anywhere, just drive
It's me
I'm just driving
Listen, I need to get witchuyou
No, I mean for, I mean for good
I'm serious this time
Nah, that's all over now, you know it
I front sometimes, but you know, this is as quiet as it's kept
Listen, I just gotta get outta here, that's all
Let me call you back, alright?
Yeah, yeah, laterEmbed
