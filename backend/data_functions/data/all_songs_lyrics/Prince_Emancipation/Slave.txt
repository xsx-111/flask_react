Slave Lyrics
Everybody keeps trying to break my heart
Everybody except for me
I just want a chance to play the part
The part of someone truly free

Like candle slowly burning, I can feel my world unravel
Hemisphere upon hemisphere lie beneath my soul, soul
My enemies kept it turning, but now they pound the gavel
And judging me accordingly, I know, I know

Everybody keeps trying to break my heart
Everybody except for me
I just want a chance to play the part
The part of someone truly free

Burning slowly candle, handle careless they did
Merrily down three heartbreak boulevards
Like fashion statements, they lie "you be looking so good tonight, kid"
I do my best to party, it's just that everybody keeps trying to break my heart

Everybody keeps trying to break my heart
Everybody except for me
I just want a chance to play the part
The part of someone truly free
Except for me (Except for me)
I just want a chance to play
(Just want to be free)

Slowly candle burns, where'd they learn hypnosis?
How'd they keep me under for so long?
Break the bread I earn, just keep me far from closest
I need their kind to illustrate what's wrong - what's wrong?
Well, I'll tell you they just keep trying to break my heart
They just keep trying to break my heart, ow!
(Everybody)
(Everybody)

Everybody keeps trying to break my heart
Everybody except for me
I just want a chance to play the part
The part of someone truly free

But I can't let you break my heart
(Everybody keeps trying to break my heart)
Slave! (Everybody keeps trying to break my heart)
Slave! Slave! (Everybody keeps trying to break my heart)
Slave!Embed
