One Kiss at a Time Lyrics
Come here, baby
Come and get your come on

Oh, I see this is what you wanted
One kiss at a time
(I got to be) I got to be up on it
If I want to make you mine

This is something every girl should know
Every part of you comes alive when you take it slow
And every nervous twitch that happens when my tongue is there
Your lips, up and down your back and every single hair
It all makes up the beauty of your grand design
Every man has got a duty, and tonight I want to do mine

Oh, I see this is what you wanted
One kiss at a time
(I got to be) I got to be up on it
If I want to make you mine

This is something every man should see
Give your woman what she wants and give her what she needs
(What she needs)
(What she needs)
(What she needs)
Ask her in a whisper that only two can hear
What can I do, what can I say, baby? Forget your every single fear
Slowly I pull your strap down and touch you as if to heal (heal)
Layer by layer, inch by inch, until your true love is revealed
Oh, I see this is what you wanted
One kiss at a time
(I got to be) I got to be up on it
If I want to make you mine

If every man could love their woman the way that I love you
Time would stop and the sky would fall
And all could see the glory of what true love can bring
That's what I sing
Oh, I see

(Oh, I see) Mmm, this is what you wanted
One kiss at a time
I got to be on my knees, I.. I.. I.. I gotta please
If I want to make you mine

Only, only, only way to get your come on, all night long
One kiss at a time (And I know that's right)
(I gotta stay) I gotta stay,  (Now come on)
On this Valentine

Come on (Come and get your come on)
Get your come on, baby
One kiss at a time
Come on, baby, let's get this on
One kiss at a time
Uh huh, yeah
One kiss at a time
One kiss at a timeEmbed
