Emale Lyrics
Ooh aah ooh
Ooh aah ooh

The email left so clearly upon a computer screen
Read like a threat that crept into her like a sex machine
Wanted: any woman who's first name begins with a "Z"
From the sound of the keys, a pawn makes a move
Her reply brings on the groove

W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
The king takes the pawn
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
It's on, it's on, it's on

He couldn't wait to tell her until after he got the nail'er
Her love would only even the score
It seemed her darling fella
He stole a hella lot of bucks from the corner store
The declaration of war that followed
She never believed, oh
In the darkest corners where widows mourn
That's where he whispered her name
He said, "We can do it here, my dear
But I fear your tears will fall like rain"
(They fall like)
"Because I must tell you
(Tell you)
While I'm deep in your smell
You got the man I want to inflict with pain
I'm running a game with my paper
I'm turning the boy to vapor
Now I wanna do the same to you
If you don't tattoo my name upon your train"
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
The king takes the pawn
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
It's on, it's on, it's on
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
The king takes the pawn
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
It's on, it's on, it's on

It's onEmbed
