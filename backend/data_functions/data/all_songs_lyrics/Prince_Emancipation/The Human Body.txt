The Human Body Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can you take me home
Where we can be alone?
Can you make me happy
'Til my pain is gone?
Can you get me excited?
Excited enough to thank the God above...

For the human body
Yeah, yeah, yeah
For the human body
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Can you get me excited
'Til my love is long?
Can you let me ride it (Oh yeah)
'Til the early morning?
Can you freak me dirty?
Freak me 'til I thank the God above...
For the human body
Yeah, yeah, yeah
For the human body
Oh


(Slave)
