Soul Sanctuary Lyrics
Loving you in silence, knowing that it's right
Under your gaze I ponder this love tonight
Unbothered by the chaos swirling around outside
In your arms is where I want to live and die

Some place where your face is all that I see
Where the love we make intoxicates intensively
In a mirror where your sweet reflection used to be
There is hope
There is joy
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary

Loving you in silence, neverending kiss
Under your gaze I can peacefully exist
Sanctuary, baby, nothing compares to this
In my darkest hour you can be my bliss
(Bliss)

All of me I give to thee down at your feet
The reassurance in your rhythm speaks to me
Over and over your screams are like a prayer
In the dark
You are there (you are there)
My soul sanctuary
Ooh, my soul sanctuary
Loving you in passion unmolested in this garden
Mango and nectarine, sweet honeydew, I beg your pardon
My mouth runneth over from ecstasy
It's true (it's true), baby, I love the taste of you

Loving you in silence, knowing that it's right
Under your gaze I ponder this love tonight
Unbothered by the chaos swirling around outside
In your arms is where I want
I want to live and die

Some place where your face is all that I see
Where the love we make intoxicates intensively
In a mirror where your sweet reflections used to be
There is hope
There is joy
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary
Oh, my soul sanctuary
