My Computer Lyrics
Welcome, you've got mail

It was Sunday night
Instead of doing what I usually do...

I scan my computer looking for a site
Somebody to talk to, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking for a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life

Nothing on TV I ain't seen before
Another murder on the news, I can't take no more
Evil Incorporated, blowing up bombs and things
I have a child, huh, I have a lot to explain
I could write a letter but who would I send it to?

It was Sunday night
Instead of doing what I usually do...

I scan my computer looking for a site
Somebody to talk to, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking for a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life
I called an old friend of mine just the other day
No congratulations, no respect paid
All she did was wonder if the rumors were true
I said - "No, I ain't dead yet, but uh.. what about you?"
I can count my friends with a peace sign: one, two

It was Sunday night
Instead of doing what I usually do...

I scan my computer looking for a site
Somebody to talk to, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking for a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life
I got no mail, my computer
I told them I don't want to see a doctor unless he's lonely too

It was Sunday night
Instead of doing what I usually do...

I scan my computer looking for a site
Somebody to talk to, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking for a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life
A better life
A better life
A better life
A better life
A better life
