Sex In the Summer Lyrics
Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long

Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Checking for bikinis, laying in the sand
Rub it like a genie, living while we can

Afternoon in the city, somewhere in July
Policemen acting... yeah, you know, de-elevate a brother's high
The mama's in the short dress, blowing in the breeze
The papa's just a-praying for the gust that will bust that butt out, please, oh!

Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Checking for bikinis, laying in the sand
Rub it like a genie, living while we can

Everybody's got a black book in case of emergency
In case the sun is shining at the beach and the honeys are out to play
The cool boys just a-watching all the pretty moves you make
Fronting in the sun, jamming for the one lover that you wanna take home
Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Checking for bikinis, laying in the sand
Rub it like a genie, living while we can

Checking out Mahalia's greatest - "In The Upper Room"
When my boy Kirk calls singing
"Hope we get together soon (soon, soon)
We can fire up the Honda and pick up Rhonda
We can jam on a brand new tune
Improvise all through the night, it'll be just like having

Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Checking for bikinis, laying in the sand
Rub it like a genie, living while we can

Can't you feel the new day dawning? All believers will see
An end to suffering and every disease
Every waking hour will soon be spent kissing each other
Angelic sisters and brothers
Clap your hands for one another, we'll be having
Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Checking for bikinis, laying in the sand
Rub it like a genie, living while we can

Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Sex in the summer
Sex in the summer
Get it on!
Sex in the summer
Right on!
Get it on!
