Style Lyrics
(Style) Style, uh!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Style, dig it
(Style) Style, come on
Uh, style

Style is not something that comes in a bottle
Style is more like Jackie O. when she was doing Aristotle
Style is not a logo that sticks to the roof of one's ass
Style is like a second cousin to class

You got it! - Style (Come on)
You got it! - Style (say what?)
You got it! - Style (Come on)
You got it! - Style (Check it)

Style ain't sitting court side with the owner of the team
Style is owning the court and charging them all a fee
Style is not lusting after someone because they're cool
Style is loving yourself until everyone else does too

You got it! - Style (Come on)
You got it! - Style (say what?)
You got it! - Style (Come on)
You got it! - Style (Check it)
Style don't get drunk on a Saturday night
Try to dress up every Sunday morning bright
Style don't get married then break the vow in a year
Style is keeping a promise
Raise your hand you all if you hear me
(Style)
(Style)
Style is not biting style when You can't find the funk
Style is the face you make on a Michael Jordan dunk
Style ain't the jeep you bought when you know your broke ass got bills
Style is letting your lover drive while you talk on the phone and chill

You got it! - Style (Come on)
You got it! - Style (say what?)
You got it! - Style (Come on)
You got it! - Style (Check it)

Bridge
Style is a gold-tooth smile with an attitude
Style is a peaceful wild posting the rude
Style is growing your own food
Style is a non-violent march
Style is an accurate account of what's inside every heart (Style)
Style is not a lie
Style is a man that cries
Style is the glow in a pregnant woman's eyes
(Style)
(Style)
(Style)
(Style)
You got it! - Style (Come on)
You got it! - Style (say what?)
You got it! - Style (Come on)
You got it! - Style (Check it)

Style is a peaceful wild y'all
(Style) You got it! - Style
(Style) You got it!
Style is not thinking about style
So let me stop (Style)
(Style) 
It's nice man
What you call that?
Style, I like that
It's about me?
(Keep, keep, keeping on, people gotta keep, keep, keeping on)
Right on (You got it!)
I ain't got no job, but I got style
Style, yeah
(Style) You got it!
Oh yeah

Hang on, hang on
Style is buying your moms a house
Style is a clean mouth
Style is puppy breath
Style is no fear of death
Style is Ali's jab
Style is hailing a cab (Style)
Then you know, giving them the finger when they pass your ass!
(Style) (You got it!) Bonnie, Bonnie
(Style) (You got it!) Oh yeah
(Style) Shirley, shake your ass, Shirley
(Sytle) Shirley, Shirley, I love you, Shirley
(Style) (You got it!)
Style is Mayte in the shower
Style is a soul new power
Style is when all black men are free
Style is you and me
(You got it!)
(You got it!)
(You got it!)Embed
