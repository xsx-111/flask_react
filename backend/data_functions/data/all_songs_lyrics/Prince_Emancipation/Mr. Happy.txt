Mr. Happy Lyrics
Turn off that weak jam, man
Come on, huh
Mr. Happy's here, huh, and we're bugging

I will take care of you
Whatever you want, I do it right
Oh, I will take care of you
Mr. Happy every day and night, oh

I got some money, I got some juice
But somethings funny, I ain't got you
I comes to party (Yeah), don't wanna be alone
I need somebody - somebody grown

I will take care of you
Whatever you want, I do it right
Oh, I will take care of you
Mr. Happy every day and night, oh

Sugarbaby, with the curly hair
Dancing crazy, underwear
Witcha name on it, looking fine ("Bought a house next to Prince") (Fine)
Keep smacking that booty and you'll be mine
I will take care of you
Whatever you want, I do it right
Oh, I will take care of you
Mr. Happy every day and night, oh

Pump it up, pump it up
Brown man, puffing on a weak jam
Understand this is 80 proof
Guaranteed to get your girl loose if she douche
Throw your set up to the roof, huh
Third finger down, if you're wild, make a sound
Look at my people getting on down (Get down, get down)
Skip the Remy and let me have some Mary Tyler Moore of that new power soul
Coming from the midwest passing every test with a fuzztone remote control

I will take care of you
Whatever you want, I do it right
Oh, I will take care of you
Mr. Happy every day and night, oh

I'll make your love come down like a freaking elevator
In the middle of the night, body vibrating like a pager
You play the drink, baby, I'll play the chaser
Do I love you? I can't love you because I hate you
See, you got this bad case of the sad face
Dinner at 8 then intercourse at my place
Keep the drapes open, VCR, the whole bit
I know it sound sick, but baby, let's make a flick
Mr. Happy, babydoll, I came to do damage (I will take care of you)
Rock your world, knock your brain to another planet
You know my North Pole can generate heat
Been thinking about me? Hmm, I can see them stains in your sheets
Before the reputation, they all used to pass me (I will take care of you)
Yeah?
Now they stop to ask me
For real?
Straight up, the lifestyle of Mr. Happy
Yeah
I will take care of you
Whatever you want, I do it right, oh
Mr. Happy every day and night
(Yeah)
