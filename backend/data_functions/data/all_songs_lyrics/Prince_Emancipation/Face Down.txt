Face Down Lyrics
(Dead like Elvis)
Check, check, one-two, check
You know what he's saying?

Face down!
Face down!

Somebody once told him that he wouldn't take Prince through the ringer
Let him go down as a washed up singer
Ain't that a bitch?
Thinkin' all along that he wanted to be rich
Never respected the root of all evil and he still don't to this day, huh
Bury him face down, let the motherfuckers kiss a ass, OK?
Face down!
Face down!

Told them he wanted to sing a song about a black child going buck wild
And they just laughed in his face
Talk to your lawyer but you got no case
What you need to do is keep your place
Next time you pull a card, it better be an ace motherfucker
Or you can lay face down (Face down!)
Face down!
Face down!

Horn
Horn
Bass
Bass

Him and her meaning who I'm singing about
And his psychoanalyst kinda saw the catalyst
As the devil with the blue jeans on, huh
Ain't it kinda funny when you see the dawn?
Sign the name they gave you
But when them motherfuckers turn around ass up, you're what?

Face down! One-two
Face down! New Power Generation in the house, bury them all
Face down! Yes, oh Lord
Face down!

Orchestra
Orchestra
Orchestra
Face down!
Orchestra
Face down!
It's in his will, I read it
He shot to kill, he said it
For those who know the number and don't call
Huh, fuck all yall
Face down!
Face down!
Face down!2Embed
