Damned If Eye Do Lyrics
Damned if I do

Tell me what's up with the teenage indecision
I'm mad in love but you won't give me permission
You said, "Be here at nine"
Then scream at me for not giving you more time
More time

Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You say you want me to love you
But when I try, you won't
Maybe, maybe we should say goodbye
Damned if I do

Tell me the truth
How many you do it to?
I smell vermouth everytime I don't get to kiss you
Enough's enough
If you don't want my lovin' then I'll give up
I'll give up
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You say you want me to love you
But when I try, you won't
Maybe, maybe we should say goodbye
Goodbye

Damned if I don't try to make you see yourself the way I do
Open minded, worldly, always ready for taboo

Tell me what's up
Are we gonna go to heaven?
I'll fill your cup
I won't do it like Kevin

Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You say you want me to love you
But when I try, you won't
Maybe, maybe we should say goodbye
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Baby, maybe we should say goodbye
Maybe we should say, "I do"
Tu siempre estas hablando de lo que tenemos que hacer
Bueno, tu sabes
Pero lo que tienes que hacer
Que?
Es buscarte una menta para la boca porque apestas!
Que es lo que tu estas diciendo?
Por favor... cometelas todas!
A mi no me apesta la boca!Embed
