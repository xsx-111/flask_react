New World Lyrics
New world
New world
New world
New world

When the sharpest vibration
Saves you from obliteration
The intelligence of your bed reacts
Covering you head to toe with an air-filled sack

When the lines blur every boy and girl
How we gonna make it in this brave new world?
Love for one another
New world
Love for one another
New world

When you wanna find some isolation
But the tracker you got from vaccination (Keeps playing)
Keeps playing "You'll Never Walk Alone" (Over and over)
They're always listening, especially on the phone
When the lines blur every boy and girl
How we gonna make it in this brave new world?
Love for one another
New world
Love for one another
New world

Wait a minute
New world

Did you hear about the new pill? It feels like sex
Guaranteed to thrill with no ill side-effects
A pill that will stop the wrinkles, a pill that will stop the pain
A pill that will make a baby never seek political gain
What's it all for when you can alter biology?
Who or what, then my friend, will you and I be?
Who or what, then my friend, will you and I be?

When the sharpest vibration
Saves you from obliteration
When the melting pot stirs, how you going to take it?
When you can't tell him from her, how you going to fake it?
Ooh, when the lines blur every boy and girl
How we gonna make it in this brave new world?
Love for one another
New world, ooh
Love for one another
(Take it, fake it)
Love for one another
New world
New worldEmbed
