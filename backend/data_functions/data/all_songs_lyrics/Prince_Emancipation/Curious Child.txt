Curious Child Lyrics
In a room full of harlots and fantasy
Destiny beckoned us there
Curious child on the balcony
We took the dare
Careless I was to caress thee
Yet never regretting the time
The joy that we shared, it was meant to be
And not a crime
No, it's not a crime
If memory serves us, we will align
To the truth that we most often share
Curious child, you are on my mind
Do you care?Embed
