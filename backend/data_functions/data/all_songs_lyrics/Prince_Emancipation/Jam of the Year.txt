Jam of the Year Lyrics
Ooh!

This is the joint I've been laying for all night
This is the one that really gets me gone
The DJ's on point, I'm saying he's alright
We going to fun baby, baby, it's on

Gotta new Puerto Rican score
And she's doin' it on the floor
When the groove from the baby's hot
I'm givin' it all I got

Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year
Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year

Give me a drummer and a funky bass line
That's all I need and I'm ready to flow
Been chilling in the cut and now I'm coming to get mine
And if I hit you once, I got to hit you some more
Gotta new Puerto Rican score
And she's doin' it on the floor
When the groove from the baby's hot
I'm givin' it all I got

Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year
Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year
Yeah, ooh
Ooh!

Let's make a toast
To the host with the most, heh
Raise your glass if you're on your own, yeah
(Raise your glass if you're on your own)
All the girls say "Ho!" (Ho!)
If your man's giving up the gold
All the fellows say "Woof!"
If you're only giving up the bone
Tonight we're going to hide it
(Whatcha say, baby?)
Yeah, baby
(Whatcha say, baby?)
This is the joint I've been laying for all night
This is the one that really gets me gone
The DJ's on point, I'm saying he's alright
We going to fun baby, baby, it's on

Gotta new Puerto Rican score
And she's doin' it on the floor
When the groove from the baby's hot
I'm givin' it all I got
I'm givin' it
I'm given's it all I got

Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year
Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year

Did you come to jam, baby? (Oh yeah)
Then let me see you, come on

Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year
Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year
Yeah, baby
(I want to, I want to jam) Come on
(Everybody's here)
(J-jam, j-jam, j-jam, j-jam of the year)
(Say what? Ha ha)
(I like that beat, oh baby)
(I want to, I want to)
(I want to, I want to)
(I want to, I want to)
(Everybody)

Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year
Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year

(Everybody's here)
(This is the jam of the year)
(Everybody's here)
Ooh! 
This is the jam of the year
Ooh, everybody's here (Everybody)
This is the jam of the year (This is the jam of the year!)Embed
