Sleep Around Lyrics
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it

Do it like she like it
So your baby don't want to sleep around
Give her what she want when she want
When it come to you, she down

Baby let me read her journal
Or should I say: she turned around and it was gone
The innuendo reads eternal
Or should I say: every other page I'm on

When she come to cook your dinner
You can ask her if what I say is true
The secret will remain within her
But her shade of red will turn yours blue
Do it like she like it
So your baby don't want to sleep around
Give her what she want when she want
When it come to you, she down

Maybe you recall last summer
When you saw her riding in my car
A kiss or two later she was back in your bed
Smelling like a fallen star
Just because she's fine
You think she don't wine and dine with everyone you know
Oh, long as you're fooled, I'm cool
She says she going to put me in a video
You need to

Do it like she like it
So your baby don't wanna sleep around
(I'm watching you, baby) (Do it like she like it, do it)
Give her what she want when she want it
When it come to you, she down
(Do it like she like)

Sleep around, sleep around
Sleep around, sleep around
I'm the one who sent the herbs and a book on how to use them
I'm the one who pointed out her fears and how to lose them
And if a difference love will make
This advice you ought to take

Baby let me read her journal
Or should I say: she turned around and it was gone
The innuendo reads eternal
Or should I say: every other page I'm on

You need to
Do it like she like, do it like she like it (Sleep around)
Do it like she like, do it like she like it (Sleep around)
Do it like she like, do it like she like it (Sleep around)
Do it like she like it, like it, like it

Do it like she like it
So your baby don't want to sleep around
Give her what she want when she want
When it come to you, she down

Sleep around, sleep around
Sleep around, sleep around
Do it like she like it
So your baby don't want to sleep around
Give her what she want when she want
When it come to you, she down

Sleep around, sleep around
Sleep around, sleep around

Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it

(Sleep around)
(Sleep around)
(Sleep around)
(Sleep around)
(Sleep around)
Do it like she like
Do it like she like
Do it like she like
Do it like she like
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it like she like it (Sleep around)Embed
