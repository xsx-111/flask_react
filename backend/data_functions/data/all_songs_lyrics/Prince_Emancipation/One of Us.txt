One of Us Lyrics
If God had a name, what would it be
And would we call it to His face
If we were faced with Him and all His glory?
What would you ask if you had just one question?

Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

What if God was one of us?
Just a slave like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

If God had a face, what would it look like
And would you want to see it
If seeing meant that you would have to believe in things like heaven
And Jesus and the saints and all the prophets?

Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
What if God was one of us?
Just a slave like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

What if God was one of us?
Just a slave like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home
Like a holy rolling stone
Back up to heaven all alone
Nobody calling on the phone
Except for the Pope maybe in Rome

But He ain't home, He ain't home, He ain't home!
No, no, no
He ain't home!
No, no, no
He ain't home!
Oh yeah, oh!
(What if God was one us?)
(What if God was one us?)
(What if God was one us?)
(What if God was one us?)Embed
