La, La, La Means I Love U Lyrics
Hey girl, I bet you didn't know I had both eyes on you
It's true
And you know what? I seen all those other guys too
Baby, frankly, I don't give a damn

Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you'd pass them by (Pass them by)
Though you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try? (Let me try)
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing
All I know is

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you

If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me
Let me hold you in my arms
Going to fill you with my charms
I'm sure that you will see (You will see)
The things I am saying are true
And the way I want to explain them to you
Baby, can you listen to me?
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you

So there, the book is open
What you want to do?
Can you do-o-o me, baby, like I want to do you?
Come here, let me hold you in my arms
Let me fill you with my charms
The things I am saying are true
And the way I explain them to you
Yes, to you!

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you

I love you, I really, really love you
Ooh listen to me, baby
Ooh, I love you, I love you, love you
Ooh, take my hand, girl
You got to understand
I want to be, I want to be, I want to be your man
You know where to find me when you make up that mindEmbed
