White Mansion Lyrics
Big white mansion
Top of the road
Latest fashion
Happy, don't you know?

Here I am in New York, yeah
See the girl bold and fair
What's in your backpack today?
Will it take my blues away?
That's OK, "you gotta run"
Huh, check it, I don't need you to have some fun
Coming from the land of snow
I guess I'm kind of used to cold

But one day I'll have a big white mansion
At the top of the road
I'm going to wear the latest fashion
I'm going to be happy, don't you know?

I could use a new guitar
Sing a tune at Chazz' bar
Maybe meet a debutante
Be a toy, do what she want (Tell me what you wanna do?)
9 o'clock, see John K
"But you don't rock, come another day" (When?)
Come another day
Spirit so low reaching up for ground (Reaching up for ground)
One day I'm going to make it in this lonely town
But one day I'll have a big white mansion
At the top of the road
I'm going to wear the latest fashion
I'm going to be happy, don't you know?

Hey there, what's your name? (What's your name, cutie?)
And can you tell me how to play the game? ("I am a winner") (Listen to this)
Do I really have to cut my hair? (No)
Now that's a cross I could never bear (How about them publishing rights?)
Sell my publishing? What a laugh! (Ha ha)
I don't know Bo but I do know math (I do know math)
Back to Minneapolis, there you go
You can't find your house underneath the snow

Because you're living in a big white mansion (Oh yes)
At the top of the road
You're wearing the latest fashion
Trying to be happy, don't you know? (Trying to be happy, happy)

Big white, big white mansion (Big white mansion)
At the top of the road
You and me wearing Versace, Gucci (Latest fashion)
Hoochies, they all wanna do me (Happy, don't you know?)
But am I really happy?
Big white mansion
(Yeah, maybe one day)
("Yo, Anita!") 
("Yo, check out that ass!")Embed
