The Love We Make Lyrics
Desperate is the day that is tomorrow
For those who do not know the time has come
To whip the dogs that beg, steal or borrow
From the table God set for His Son

Wicked is the witch that stands for nothing
All the while watching to see you fall
Deeper than the ditch that bred your suffering
The one being dug right now by them all

Happy is the way to meet your burdens
No matter how heavy or dark the day
Pity on those with no hope for tomorrow
It's never as bad as it seems until we say

Precious is the baby with a mother
That tells him that his Savior is coming soon
All that believe will cleanse and purify themselves
Put down the needle, put down the spoon
Put down the needle, put down the spoon

Sacred is the prayer that asks for nothing, oh
While seeking to give thanks for every breath we take, oh
Blessed are we inside this prayer
For in the new world, we will be there
The only love there is, is the love we make
The only love there is, is the love we make
(The only love there is, is the love we make)
Only love there is, only love there is
The only love there is, is the love we make (Yeah)
The only love there is, is the love we make1Embed
