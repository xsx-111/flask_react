In This Bed Eye Scream Lyrics
To these walls I talk
Telling them what I wasn't strong enough to say
To these walls I talk
Telling them how I cried the day you went away

How did we ever lose communication?
How did we ever lose each other's sound?
Baby, if you wanna, we can fix the situation
Maybe we can stop the rain from coming down

In this bed I scream
Lonely nights I lay awake thinking of you
And if I'm cursed with a dream
A thousand times I feel whatever I've put you through

Tell me, how're we gonna put this back together?
How're we gonna think with the same mind?
Knowing all along that life is so much better
Living and loving together all the time
Living and loving
In this bed I, in this bed I, in this bed I scream
In this car I drive
I'm looking for the road that leads back To the soul we shared
With my very life
I'd gladly be the body upon the cross we bear
(Cross we bear)

How did we ever lose communication?
How did we ever lose each other's sound?
Baby, if you wanna, we can fix the situation
Maybe we can stop the rain from coming down

Maybe we can't, maybe we can
Stop the rain, stop the rain
In this bed I, in this bed I, in this bed I scream
I scream
In this bed I screamEmbed
