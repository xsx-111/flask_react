Emancipation Lyrics
Ever since I was a little baby
I had to have double everything
When they tell me that's enough
That's when I want to fill my cup
To the top, Johnny, hear me sing

Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: see you in the purple rain
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: break the chain, break the chain

Ever since that Eve did unto Adam, alright
What somebody been sure enough doing to me
(Watch it!)
I've been trying to break the chain
Get my little ass out the game
I'd rather sing with a bit more harmony, oh

Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: see you in the purple rain
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: break the chain, break the chain
Johnny please, huh, when I was on my knees
My back was broken and my spirit ill at ease
And now it seems just like the autumn leaves
Your money's turned from green to brown and now you best believe

Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: see you in the purple rain
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: break the chain, break the chain, break the chain
Break the chain, oh yeah
Well, sure enough
See you in the purple rain
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Break the, break the, break the chain!

Hey!
Alright!
Hey!
(Emancipation)
Hey!
(Emancipation)
Hey!
(Emancipation)
Hey!
(Emancipation)
Hey!
(Emancipation)
(Emancipation)
Free, don't think I ain't
(Emancipation)Embed
