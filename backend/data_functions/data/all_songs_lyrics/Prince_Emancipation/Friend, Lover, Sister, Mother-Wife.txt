Friend, Lover, Sister, Mother/Wife Lyrics
If I ever held a hand
It was only because I'd never held your hand
That was part of the plan
I had to get it right if I was to be your man
And if I ever kissed your lips
I needed time to cross the others off my list
(Off my list)
A higher high to the trip
(Trip)
I wanted you to go, that was my wish
Yes it was
(Ooh my)

Friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
Air, food, water, love of my life

If I ever shared a bed
It was only because I wanted to live up to what the people said, oh yes
(What they say, what they say?)
Now I'm living instead
Everyday just to say you're the only one who's in my head
(The only one)
Oh yes you are
And if I ever made you cry
All I have to do is think about it and I just want to die
(I just want to die)
(I just want to break down and die, die, die, die)
How I'd ever make it by
(I don't know)
Without you, baby
(Without you, baby)
I don't know (No!)
I hope I never have to try, yeah
(Please don't ever leave me)
Oh, listen to me
Friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
My sweet, sweet wife
Air, food, water, love of my life


The eyes of my child I see every time you look at me
(I see a sweet baby smile)
A sweet baby smile like a light that shines for all to see

If I ever held a hand
It was only because I'd never held yours
That was part, part of the plan
I had to get it right if I was to be your man

Friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
Air, food, water, love of my life
Friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
Air, food, water, love of my life
Teacher (Teacher), healer (Healer), feeler (Feeler), sight for sore eyes
(Let me look at your eyes, you're so pretty)
Oh, yes you are, baby
(Ooh my)
Don't you know you're my friend, my lover, my sister, love of my life?
(Mother, wife)
Yeah, baby, yes you are
(I'll stay with you forever)
(I'll stay with you forever)
'Til death do us part, baby
(Yes sir!)
Air (Te amo), food (Te amo), water (Te amo), love (Love of my life)
You are the only, only love of my life
My friend, lover, sister, mother, wife2Embed
