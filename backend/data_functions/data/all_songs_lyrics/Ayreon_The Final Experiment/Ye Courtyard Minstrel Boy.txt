Ye Courtyard Minstrel Boy Lyrics
A new horizon
Hear the travellers call!
Behold there lies a kingdom
Go forth, ye minstrel tall!
Sing of your wisdom
Spread tidings of joy
A feast of song and laughter
Ye courtyard minstrel boy
O'dance thee 'round the table
For conquerors and kings!
Thou must win the heart of Gweniviere
Fair maiden of the king!
Thy lord, thy master
Arthur thee so bold
Heed the words of Ayreon
And thy future will unfold!
Sing ye tales of wonder
Whilst ye hide behind the joy!
Cast thy spell asunder
Ye courtyard minstrel boy!
Sing ye, oh sing ye, courtyard minstrel boy!
Sing ye, oh sing ye, courtyard minstrel boy!
A day of splendour
How beautiful birds sing!
Ladies, lords and masters
And rainbows he would bring!
A child's sadness
Sweet dreams, oh princely boy!
Let thine eyes reveal the madness
Ye courtyard minstrel boy!
Sing ye tales of wonder
Whilst ye hide behind the joy!
Cast thy spell asunder
Ye courtyard minstrel boy!Embed
