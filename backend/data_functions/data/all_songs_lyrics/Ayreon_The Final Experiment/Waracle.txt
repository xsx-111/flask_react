Waracle Lyrics
Echoes of a thousand screams
Smoke, blood and fire
A deserted battlefield
Millions of men will die
At one man's desire
And the docile mass will yield
All through the ages
Men will die before their time
In an everlasting war!
As long as man is taught
That war is not a crime
Man will fight for evermore!
Out of the ashes
A warlord will arise
And tyrannize the land!
His reign of terror
Will cost many a sacrifice
An inferno is at hand!
All through the centuries
Men will be caged
In the name of liberty!
As long as man shall live
Wars will be waged
Or will we ever be set free?
Set me free!

Oooohh...

Set me free!

Pray god almighty! Set me free! Set me free!

Set me free!

Set me free, oh lord!

Set me free!

I'm begging you, I'm begging thee, just to set me free!

Ohhhh!
The road to ruin
Gets shorter all the time
As technology will improve
It takes but one man
To commit the ultimate crime
And make the final move!
All through the ages
Men will die before their time
In an everlasting war!
As long as man shall live
Wars will be waged!
Or will we ever, will we ever be set free?

Set me free!

Oooohh...

Set me free!

Pray god almighty! Set me free! Set me free!
Set me free!

Set me free, oh lord!

Set me free!

I'm begging you, I'm begging thee, just to set me free!

Ohhhh!Embed
