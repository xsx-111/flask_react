Sail Away To Avalon Lyrics
Noble men in shining armour
Knights of the table round
Go out and ride like thunder!
Cross the sky at the speed of...
Sound the horn, 'n blow the trumpets
Upon the castle wall
Now the quest has started
Listen to the prophet's call!
The prophet's call, yeah yeah
Sail away!
Sail away to Avalon!
The journey has begun
Sail away through the night!
Sail away, never die!
The gods are at your side
Sail away through the night, sail away!
Ride on the road to glory
Find the holy grail
And learn the ancient story's
More than just a...
Fairy-tale about the key to life
And all its mysteries
You'll find the grail within you
Slay the dragon in your dreams!
Sail away!
Sail away to Avalon!
The journey has begun
Sail away through the night!
Sail away, never die!
The gods are at your side
Sail away through the night...
Sail away!
Sail away to Avalon!
The journey has begun
Sail away through the night!
Sail away, never die!
The gods are at your side
Sail away through the night...Embed
