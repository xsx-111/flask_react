The Awareness Lyrics
… Let us go back to the Dark Ages
(Dark Ages – Dark Ages – Dark Ages – Dark Ages)
A. The Premonition

B. Dreamtime (Words Become Song)

A cry in the silence
A shine in the dark
Like a rising star
The dream is coming
Images of violence
A flight through time and space
It's such a lonely place
The dream has started
The smoke is rising
The vision's getting clearer
And words become a song...
In the dreamtime
I've lost control
Marooned and cold
I suffer the fears
Of a future untold
I cannot change
The shape of things to come
The smoke is rising
The vision's getting clearer
And words become a song...
In the dreamtime

The smoke is rising
The vision's getting clearer
The hands of time are whirling around
I'm realizing
The future's getting nearer
And words become a song...

The smoke is rising
The vision's getting clearer
And words become a song...
C. The Awakening
