I sense a fear
Deep inside
The end is near
I cannot hide
Blood is spilt
My quest is unfulfilled
There's still so much
I long to see
I need to touch
I wish to be
I can't believe
This is all I can achieve...
Hark me now and let me go
To far-away lands and distant shores
An angel at my side
No evil plans or future wars
Take me high on a magic ride
Did you ever care
How I would feel
As you dreamt up
This one-way deal?
Lords of time
Don't you understand?
My life's been rough
I was born to lose
I've had enough
Of them future-blues
Grant my wish
My wish is your command...
Hark me now and let me go
To far-away lands and distant shores
An angel at my side
No evil plans or future wars
Take me high on a magic rideEmbed
