Eyes Of Time LyricsA. Eyes of Time

I cannot see with these eyes!
My world is dark
Like a cold eternal night
I could not tell you no lies!
My words are lost
In a shroud of mystery

Tell me what you see!

I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time!

Tell me what you feel!

I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind!
(From the eyes of time)
I do not know where I am!
I'm lost in time
Drifting in eternity
I cannot tell if it's real
A fantasy
Or a view of things to come

Tell me what you see!

I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time!

Tell me what you feel!

I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind!
(From the eyes of time)
I'm still trying to understand
Why do I see the things I see?
Could it be a future world
That's warning us through me?
I'm still trying to understand
Why do I know the things I know?
Does it mean I'm a god?
Will nobody tell me so?
Tell me what you see!

I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time!

Tell me what you feel!

I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind!

Tell me what you see!

I see the world through the eyes of time!

Tell me what you feel!

I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind... Free my mind... free my mind...
Free my mind... Free my mind...
