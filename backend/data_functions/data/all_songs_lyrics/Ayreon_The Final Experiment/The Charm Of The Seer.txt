The Charm Of The Seer Lyrics
I've been lost in the valley of nightmares
I've been found in the garden of dreams
Speak thy charm, I know you are out there
Cast thy spell and silence their screams
As I poise on the edge of life
Where time disappears
I bow in fear
To the charm of the Seer
I've seen fear in valiant faces
I've seen hope in desperate eyes
Lead me home to familiar places
Lead me back to crystalline skies
As I poise on the edge of life
Where time disappears
I bow in fear
To the charm of the Seer
I have failed, I have been forsaken!
I've been scorned and misunderstood!
I have lost, my life has been taken!
I'd surrender if only I could!
As I poise on the edge of life
Where time disappears
I bow in fear
To the charm of the Seer!
I bow in fear to the charm of the Seer! (Ooooooohh....)
I bow in fear to the charm of the Seer! (Ooooooohh....)
I bow in fear to the charm of the Seer! (Ooooooohh....)
I bow in fear to the charm of the Seer! (Ooooooohh....)
I bow in fear to the charm of the Seer! (Ooooooohh....)
I bow in fear to the charm of the Seer! (Ooooooohh....)
I bow in fear to the charm of the Seer! (Ooooooohh....)
I bow in fear to the charm of the Seer!
Ooooooooooohh-hoh-hoh-hooo! Hoh-hoo!
(I bow in fear to the charm of the Seer!)
Ooooooohh....Embed
