Listen To The Waves Lyrics
All the trees have fallen
The soil is scorched and dry
I can't respire
A storm of fire
Is raging in the sky
Where is all the wildlife?
Extinct from pole to pole
The hunt for skin
A deadly sin
Took its heavy toll
The seas are red, the skies are grim
The soil is filled with graves
The earth is dead, the sun is dim
Listen to the waves
We befoul the air
And burn a hole in the sky
Deadly rays
From outer space
Cause our race to die
Standing at the crossroads
A choice of life and death
We'll take more care
And clear the air
Or take our final breath
The seas are red, the skies are grim
The soil is filled with graves
The earth is dead, the sun is dim
Listen to the waves
The seas are red, the skies are grim
The soil is filled with graves
The earth is dead, the sun is dim
Listen to the waves...Embed
