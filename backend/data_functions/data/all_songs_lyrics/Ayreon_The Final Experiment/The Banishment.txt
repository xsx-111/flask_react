The Banishment LyricsA. A New Dawn

B. The Gathering

C. The Accusation

Mmmm....
Have you seen his eyes
Up in the skies
Like hypnotized?
And he never smiles
He never cries
Have you heard his song
Fierce and strong
Right or wrong?
Should he be condemned?
For he doesn't belong

What have I done?
You've aroused the forces of destruction!

What have I done?

You've unleashed the rage of the gods!

What have I done?

You've denounced the wonder of creation!

What have I done?

You've betrayed your own
Now you have to pay!
It has been foretold
In days of old
An evil soul
Will corrupt the world
To achieve his goal
He's the devil's seed!
An evil breed
He's gonna make you bleed!
He'll take all he needs
With uncontrollable greed!

What have I done?

You've aroused the forces of destruction!

What have I done?

You've unleashed the rage of the gods!

What have I done?

You've denounced the wonder of creation!

What have I done?
You've betrayed your own
Now you have to pay!
You have to pay!

I've done nothing at all!
No, nothing at all! (Ohh I'm an innocent man!)
I've done nothing at all!
No, nothing at all! (Let me go!)
I've done nothing at all! (What did I do?)
No, nothing at all! (What did I do?)
I've done nothing at all! (Let me go!)
No, nothing at all!
(Innocent man, at the end of the day... I'm an innocent man...
All the time... You've got me wrong...You've got me...
What did I do? What did I do?...)
D. The Banishment

E. Oblivion

If I have died, then this must be hell!
If I am alive, I cannot break this gruesome spell!
I am seeking relief, and finding none!
I have fallen into oblivion!
A force within dominates my tormented soul!
And empowers me to regain absolute control!
I shall not yield, for I am the chosen one!
Who shall rise from... oblivion!Embed
