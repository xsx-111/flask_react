Prologue LyricsA. The Time Telepathy Experiment

This is the voice of Merlin
Listen well, for it concerns you
This chronicle commences in the year 2084 A.D
Mankind has virtually destroyed itself
Its survival depends on "The Final Experiment"
Scientists from the 21st century have developed a new computer program called "Time Telepathy"
By using this technique they have sent visions of humanities' decline back in time
These transmissions have been received by the mind of a blind minstrel, who lives in 6th century Britain
His name... is "Ayreon"
B. Overture

C. Ayreon's Quest

It shall be Ayreon's quest to sing of these visions and thus warn the world of its impending downfall in order to change its future into a long and prosperous oneEmbed
