Rock Lobster Lyrics
Sca-do-ba-da, eww
Sca-do-ba-da, eww
(Sca-do-ba-da) We were at a party (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) His ear lobe fell in the deep (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Someone reached in and grabbed it (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) It was a rock lobster (Eww)

(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster

Eww
Eww
We were at the beach (Eww)
Everybody had matching towels (Eww)
Somebody went under a dock (Eww)
And there they saw a rock (Eww)
It wasn't a rock (Eww)
It was a rock lobster (Eww)

(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster
Rock lobster, rock lobster
Motion in the ocean (Hoorah)
His air hose broke (Hoorah)
Lots of trouble (Hoorah)
Lots of bubble (Hoorah)
He was in a jam (Hoorah)
He's in a giant clam! (Hoorah)

Rock, rock, rock lobster!
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Down, down...
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Sca-do-ba-da, eww
Sca-do-ba-da, eww
(Sca-do-ba-da) Underneath the waves (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Mermaids wavin' (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Wavin' to mermen (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Wavin' sea fans (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Sea horses sailing (Eww)
(Sca-do-ba-da) Dolphins wailing (Eww)

(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Rock lobster
Rock lobster, rock lobster
Hoorah, hoorah
Red snappers snappin' (Hoorah)
Clam shells clappin' (Hoorah)
Mussels flexin' (Hoorah)
Flippers flippin' (Hoorah)
Rock, rock

Rock, rock, rock lobster!
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Down, down...
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Lobster! Rock!
Lobster! Rock!
Let's rock!

Boys in bikinis
Girls in surfboards
Everybody's rockin'
Everybody's frugin'
Twistin' 'round the fire, havin' fun
Bakin' potatoes, bakin' in the sun
Put on your nose guard
Put on the lifeguard
Pass the tanning butter
Here comes a stingray
There goes a manta ray
In walked a jellyfish
There goes a dogfish
Chased by a catfish
In flew a sea robin
Watch out for that piranha
There goes a narwhal
Here comes a bikini whale!
Rock lobster (Lobster, rock lobster)
Rock lobster (Lobster, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Rock lobster (Lobster, rock lobster)
Rock lobster (Lobster, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah8Embed
