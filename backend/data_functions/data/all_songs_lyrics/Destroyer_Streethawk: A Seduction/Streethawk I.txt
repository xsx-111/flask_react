Streethawk I LyricsHey girl, come on and take a whirl in my machine
Though, I'm telling you now, it leaves scars on the wanton
Behind these bars there's a house built for haunting
Now, go or don't go
Just don't say no
Cause the listeners of the world are on her side
The listeners of the world are on her side

She said the city was dead and gutless
I cried for the city
You gotta move to stay alive
You do the very modern jive
Oh, once I knew what that wisdom was for
September girls think those pearls just wash up on the shore
Now, go or don't go
Just don't say no
With the listeners of the world all on her side
The listeners of the world all on her side

Streethawk tempts the huntress
"Let the girls go insane!"
As we lay down our weapons and sure enough
We are slain by that stuffEmbed
