Virgin with a Memory LyricsWas it the movie or the making of Fitzcarraldo
Where someone learned to love again?
"I can't remember" is not the same as "I don't know"
Virgin with a memory
Was it the movie or the making of Fitzcarraldo
Where your mother decided to fashion herself
After the sad deity we left on the shelf?
She wanted blood, all she got was sacrifice
She wanted blood, all she got was sacrifice
She wanted blood, all she got was sacrifice
Virgin without a memory
Now's your chance to be free
Of all those favorite bands you ditched for one that's grander
No Use For A Name to The Make-Up
It's all the same
The singer not the song, no
The singer not the song, no
The singer not the song, no
Formative years, wasted
In love with our peers, we tasted life with the stars
Anticlimactic as Mars was, still
A red Earth with no way of knowing
The silver colossus exists just to be growing
A red Earth with no way of knowing
The silver colossus exists just to be growing
Was it the movie or the making of Fitzcarraldo
Where someone learned to love again?
Where someone learned to love again?
