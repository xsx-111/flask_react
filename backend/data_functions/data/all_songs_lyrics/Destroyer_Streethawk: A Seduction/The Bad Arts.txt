The Bad Arts Lyrics
Absolve, absolve, absolve
We spent the better part of the day
Waiting for the wave to hit our side of town
It didn't
Absolve, absolve, absolve
I washed my hands of the stuff of legends
And what news of the horizon?
I hear it's all just a horizontal myth
So stop your cruising, start your criticizing, oh
Indulge yourself for once, feel medium between them
God damn, your eyes
They just had to be twin prizes waiting for the sun
And God damn, your eyes
They just had to be twin prizes waiting for the sun
They just had to be twin prizes waiting for the sun

See them sporting those eagle iron-ons
You made me swear never to wear
Why did you spend the '90s cowering?
Why did you spend the '90s cowering?
And they're singing those inspirationals
You penned back in '72
And the hotels of choice are now toasting your voice
As the spas ring out, "What's another word for sacrament?"
The world woke up one day to proclaim
"Thou shalt not take part in, or make, bad art"
In these tough, tough times
Friends like mine would rather dash than dine
On the bones of what's thrown to them
When a wave of her wand has us back at the pond
Taking notes for our crooked underground

The world woke up one day to proclaim
"Thou shalt not make or take part in the bad arts"
You see, the singer sold us out
The guitarist lost his clout on Life-Of-The-Mind Day
When signs become impure again
The crowd doesn't know where or when
To let it all hang out
Bloodlet yourself, street style

You've got the spirit, don't lose the feeling
You've got the spirit, don't lose the feeling
You've got the spirit, don't lose the feeling
You've got the spirit, don't lose the feeling
Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
(You've got the spirit) Don't lose the feeling
You've got the spiritEmbed
