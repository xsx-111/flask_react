English Music Lyrics(English music)
Soldier, you got to get out more
There is life after property
Everyone has got a finder's fee
Find something difficult to do and do it
Write your English music, write your English music
Write your English music, run free!
She tasted of the Christmas wines and said
"So many things have run through me
I know the altar boys, they just wanna do me and that's fine
You gotta have faith, hey, yeah you gotta have..."
Once again, it's a quarter to three by Ambleside By The Sea
And something's telling you, "Boy, it's time to take sides"
And something's telling you, "Boy, it's time to take sides"
And something's telling you, "Boy, it's time to take sides
And write your English music though you know it will come to no good
When brilliance has a taste for suffering and you're softer than the Western world"Embed
