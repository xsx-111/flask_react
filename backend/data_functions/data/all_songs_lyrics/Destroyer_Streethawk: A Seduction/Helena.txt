Helena Lyrics
Helena, the ramifications are very large tonight
The stars say don't pick a fight or barge things around
See, apparently our bloodlines are botched beyond redemption
Luckily, you don't believe in redemption
This may work in your favor, I'm told

So throw the old furniture in the fire
As the children go barbaric behind the wire
They're just children

It's a drag the way your flag had to come down
With one of the above Americas so ferociously in bloom
But pistols at dawn can only work for so long
Curbed appetites took flight when you decided to call the song
“A Pacific-Northwest Bitch Gets Shown To Her Room”

So throw the old furniture in the fire
As the children go barbaric behind the wire
They're just children
And this one goes out, just like the one before
To the 17th version of How I Won the War
Oh, first Destroyer! And, oh, now the Underground!
Helena, the ramifications are very large tonight
The stars say don't pick a fight or barge things around

Just throw the old furniture in the fire
As the children go barbaric behind the wire
They're just children
They're just children
They're just children
They're just childrenEmbed
