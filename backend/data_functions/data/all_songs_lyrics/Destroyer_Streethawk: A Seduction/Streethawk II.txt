Streethawk II Lyrics
There ought to be a law
There ought to be a railroad
To take me away
To take me away

There ought to be a law
An ocean of escape
To take me away
To take me away

There ought to be a law
There ought to be a railroad
That takes you away
That takes you away

There ought to be a law
An order of restraint
That takes you away
That takes you away

I heard those symphonies come quick
Now that you are sick of breathing new life into the form
Hey Streethawk, you've been spotted hanging out outside the storm
Why don't you fly?Embed
