The Sublimation Hour LyricsSo you had the best legs in a business built for kicks
But was this changing of the guards really supposed to make you sick?
It's alright
The sublimation hour!
Medium rotation, the shock of the new
And a memo from Feldman saying, "Everything is true"
It's alright
The sublimation hour!
Don't spend your life conceiving
That the widows won't get sick of their grieving
'Til everyone walks out
Hey, isn't that what rock 'n' roll is all about, princess?
Express your bloated self, willful and indignant
In the face of somebody's lord
You try to summon up the spirits live on Face the Nation
But the port authority just taxed incantations
Alright
The sublimate hour!
Auction off the temple, it's money well-spent
Hey, are those tears in your eyes as the wind cries, "enlargement"?
Alright
The sublimate hour!
Don't spend your life conceiving
That the widows won't get sick of their grieving
'Til everyone walks out
Hey, isn't that what rock 'n' roll is all about, princess?
Confess your bloated self, willful and indignant
In the face of somebody's lord, ah
So put your hands together, I hear it's a must
Until this phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust
It's alright
The sublimation hour!
I guess the streets will suffice 'til everybody makes nice
But there's a rumor going 'round even Destroyers have a price
It's alright
The sublimation hour!
Don't spend your life conceivingEmbed
