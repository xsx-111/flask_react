Beggars Might Ride LyricsBeggars might ride you into doing one thing
When humiliation gets taught
And humility does not have the ability to move a muscle
Don't do the Hustle
Beggars might ride
You've heard of the sea versus the scenery
Where every time a man goes overboard
It sounds like somebody's scoring on Beggars' Night
Hey, distro king for the hearing impaired
I'm starting to think I know why you were spared
Paradise felt fine, what's yours was mine
Collaborators fuck us every time
Beggars might ride
You're taking rides with the sensitive miser
Taking sides with the new sympathizers
Girl, what could have been 'til you gave up the violin
For a slight but distasteful penchant for men
Beggars might ride
You've heard it said and it's true
For someone so beautifully scarred
I imagine it must be hard
To stay away from a life of public relations
But try, girl, you've got to try
You've got to stay critical or die
Stay critical or dieEmbed
