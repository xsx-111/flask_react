Strike LyricsWhy do you work when you're sick of lifting
When you're sick of lifting?
The festivities left you on the shelf
Why are you always trying to please everybody but yourself
That which bears witness to it's own failure
Are you so sure?
Why do you work for the festival
When you're sick of lifting spirits
Spirits, spirits to the sky
"Body" and "Soul"
Two words for that same nameless thing you have never known
Why do you work
In place of bearing witness to your own inclusion
Inclusion
Inclusion
And strike
And strike
