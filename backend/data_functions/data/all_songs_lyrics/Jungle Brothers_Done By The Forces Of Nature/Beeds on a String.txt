Beeds on a String Lyrics
I can feel it
Feel— Feel— Feel— Feel— Feel— (I can— I can— I can— I can—)
Feel— Feel— Feel— Feel— Feel it
I can— I can— I can feel it
Feel— Feel— Feel—
Uh, ha, ow

Backed by the Baby Bam beat, the rare groove
Jungle Brothers, no competition and nothin' to prove
Want me to be on your family tree
But you're all about yourself, which won't allow me to be
You see, I'm the kind of brother that gets up on the stage
To get down for the people that came and paid
I throw on my uniform, but not to get pretty
Show no shame (Shame), feel no pity (Pity)
You all showed up and I'm glad you came
Still the same person, everything's the same
Once again I show towards you all due respect
But my main concern for now is keepin' things in check, yeah
Hands in the air and everybody will sing
As they hang on the my rhythm like the beads on my string

Ba, da-da-da, da-da (Check the rhyme), yes
Ba, da-da-da, da-da (Check the rhyme), uh-huh
Ba, da-da-da, da-da (Yeah, that joint's real funky), check the rhyme
Ba, da-da-da, da-da (Yo, check this one out, right here), check the rhyme
My soul sings a funky song as the beat goes on and on
Another day gone and still learnin' my right from wrong
The party's gettin' packed as I turn up the bass more
The meter's goin' crazy, up and down like a see-saw
Takin' off my crown to give my lo-lo-lo-locks a breath
I wanna stop myself, but I still got some rhyme left
Uncle Sam breaks it down as everybody shakes their butt
Brothers gettin' happy lettin' out the longer nut
Hands in the air and everybody will sing
As they cling on the rhythm like the beads on my string, ha

Ba, da-da-da, da-da (Check the rhyme), yeah
Ba, da-da-da, da-da (Check the rhyme), sing that song
Ba, da-da-da, da-da (Check the rhyme), sing it
Ba, da-da-da, da-da (Check the rhyme), you know what?

Sisters on the side sayin', "Get on, get on"
Brothers everywhere sayin' (Sayin') "jump on it"
Can't get enough of what I'm doin' here
Well, the picture is painted, the message is clear, here
The beads are the people, the string is the vibe (Vibe)
The vibe is what mentally connects the tribe (Tribe)
Once you get on it, you can't get off it
You fell off beat, well baby doll, you lost it
Maybe the next time (Time), maybe the next rhyme (Rhyme)
Could be the next week (Next week) or even the next beat (Next beat)
Makes you feel at home, beats up against your dome
Find yourself inside an African syndrome
Found your culture (Culture), brother, I told you (Told you)
Black is beautiful (Beautiful), green is powerful (Powerful)
You was afraid, that's why you stayed away
The true blue brothers, they followed me anyway
I gave 'em alternative ('Ternataive), found a new way to live (Way to live)
Somethin' that's positive (Positive), which I thought was good to give
A whole lot of tribes of us, feelin' the vibes from us
Everybody's down (Down), nobody's ridin' us
Hands in the air and everybody will sing
As they hang on to my rhythm like the beads on my string
Now, everybody, pump your first as we proceed to leave this place (Leave this place)
Step into a zone where there's no mind for color or face
Do what you're doing 'cause the vibe ain't over yet
You learned a little something and I hope that you don't forget (Don't forget)
The vibe has no color, just a cause and a tempo
Hold on tight, 'cause we can't help if you let go (Let go)
Children are the future, so let them lead the way
Carry our nation to a brighter and better day (Better day)
Evil will be broken by Allah in due time
We will soon find out what is matter and what is mind (What is mind)
Now hands in the air and together we sing
As we see the pretty colors of the beads on the string (String)Embed
