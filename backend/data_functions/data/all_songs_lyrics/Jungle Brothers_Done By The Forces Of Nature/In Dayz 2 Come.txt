In Dayz 2 Come Lyrics
Then the other thing I wanna know is
Are there any records of Black music these days
That are popular, or is it just about, ra—
You know, about— it's, um, whatever you call it
Um, oh, what do you call those things that you just played?
Rap music?
Rap music, yes
You mean is there another kind of music?
Yes
Of course there is
Well, what is it? (Shut up)

Due to the circumstances
A man such as I has to take chances
Fixed inside a position
I must take on the Bambaataa mission
Foresee a future of unity
You and I, you and me
Put into motion by the redheaded one
Hallelujah, let it be done
If you're down, I call upon you
What I'm talkin' about might've just dawned on you
The ball drops, the clock stops
The chains of paradise unlock
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
Prophesized in days to come
All in due time, time'll tell
But for now, my record's gotta sell
Get the message across, get the music across
Get it across without crossin' over
I ain't sellin' out just to get fame (Nah)
Remaining the same 'til the end of the game
Keepin' brothers calm 'til they understand
It's a master plan to get had by the man
Peace is the power to hold power with mind
The power they used to rob my people's gold mine
The power they used to say my thing is a trend
But as you can see, rock and roll didn't end
Backed by Zulus from a mighty nation
Keepin' on, keepin' on to my destination
In a world that revolves on love and hate
In days to come, my prophesized fate

Smooth and easy, I'ma run it through for y'all
Mirror, mirror, who's that mightiest of them all? (God)
Now I'm a give y'all the lowdown
Judgement day, day of the showdown
Who's on the list of life?
Not you, 'cause you was cheatin' on your wife
You wanna make it to Heaven, you gotta earn it
Change your life around, take it and turn it around
Try to make the most of it
Is this Paradise? (Yep) Oh, I love it
Like my man said before, time will tell
Hear the sounds of Gabriel
Shout out "no" as the clouds start fallin'
Haha, you shouldn't have been stallin'
Now you wanna come cryin' on my shoulder
While I'm on my knees prayin' to Jehovah
You never thought it would come, but you was wrong, see?
Now you're on the floor beggin' for mercy
(Please) Brother, it's too late
In days to come is your prophesized fate, uh
The name of the game is rapture
The name of the game is rapture
The— The— The name of the game is rapture
The name of the game is rapture (Tell 'em what we're saying )
Yo, Red, yo, Red, yo, yo, niggas is wildin' up here in the capital
Told those guys to duck, cover, the whole shit
Smashed up my windshield, chasin' niggas down
Fucked shit up, niggas pullin' out guns
Word up
Yo, um, they got the phone, they got the beeper, they got the cash
Smashed up my windshield
You can get here on the 508-8980 joint
Word up, I gotta tell you what's up, 'cause I'm goin' for those niggas regardless
Yo, get with me, hurry up, peace
The name of the game is rapture
The— The— The name of the game is rapture
The name of the game is rapture
The name of the game is rap— rapture
Days to come (In days to come)
Days to come (In days to come)
Days to come (In days to come)
Days to come (In days to come)
Days to come (In days to come)
Days to come (In days to come)
Days to come (In days to come)Embed
