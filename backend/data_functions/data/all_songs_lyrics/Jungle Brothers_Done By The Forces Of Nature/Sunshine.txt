Sunshine LyricsAhhhhh...
WJBS, on your radio dial
With the morning of the fox, that rocks the box
Expect sunshine today!
For yesterday's rain has faded far away
Now we seek a brand new day, a brand new way
Learn my brothers and sisters, learn

Nighttime fades away, on to the next day
The weatherman predicts a clear sunny Saturday
Relax laid back and feelin the cool breeze
Positive vibes in sauce and the melodies
Gather my leaves and all my minerals
Fix myself a bowl of vegetables
Ice cold water and chopped up fruits
Gonna be a long day so I throw on my boots
Stretch out my hut and beyond the sun rises
Clouds gather round and suddenly hides it
Doubled back cause it started pourin
Children scared of the thunder roarin
Given the light but now there's darkness
Started with intelligence, now there's ignorance
Negative vibes now I don't feel right
I want my sunshine, I want my sunlight
Same old story, over and over
Somebody tryin to take knowledge over
So I fight back with a native dance
Sing my song and chant my chants
	Rain, rain, go away
	Please come back another day
	The sun will shine and now the sky is gray
	Please rain, go way
	{Lah lahhhhhhh-lah.. lah-lahhhh..}
	{Lah lahhhhhhh-lah.. lah-lahhhh..}
	{Lah..}

The pavement sweats as a hot day sets in
I need to cool off so I find me a hydrant
Pull out my wrench and turn on a happy face
See some buckets I think there'll be a chase
Water splashin, children laughin
Hopin the feelin, will keep on lastin
A shot rings out and a young girl hits the ground
Someone wasn't in the mood for playin around
The mother cries as she sees her young one
^--]	{Lah lahhhhhhh-lah.. lah-lahhhh..}
Victim of a fool while playin in the hot sun
Kangaroos came and cleared out the area
^--]	{Lah lahhhhhhh-lah.. lah-lahhhh..}
Covered her up so the sun won't beat her {Lah..}
The sun still shines but the day now feels gray
Oh Mr. Rain would you please please go away?
The sun still shines but the day now feels gray
Oh Mr. Rain would you please please go away?
	Ah-uhh, AHH uhh, uh ah-ah-AHH-uh (sunshine)
	AHH-uh-uhh, uh-uh, uh-AHH-uh (sunshine)
	AHH-uh-uhh, uh-uh, AHH-uh-uh (sunshine)
	AHH-uh-uh, uh-AHHhhhh.. (sunshine)
	Rain, rain, go away
	Please come back another day
	The sun will shine and now the sky is gray
	Please rain, go way
	{Lah lahhhhhhh-lah.. lah-lahhhh..}
	{Lah lahhhhhhh-lah.. lah-lahhhh..}
	{Lah lahhhhhhh-lah.. lah-lahhhh..}
	{Lah lahhhhhhh-lah.. lah-lahhhh..}
	{Lah..}
WJBS and in the studio right now the Jungle Brothers
How you doin my friends?  {*various chatter*}
Before we go on, say a few words to the people

Yeah I'd like to say I'd like to say somethin serious
Real serious
The sun shinin, the guidin light
The fire that we all attempt to fight
The only thing is you can't put it out
You blow and blow but that makes it grow
Bright around and it was made for me
A gift from God that he gave to me
You eat it and chew it, and then you swallow it
And wisdom is what you get from it
Try to stop me from gettin mine
And you can kiss me where the sun don't shine
Yeah, there's room out there for those who want some
Cause "Everybody's got a little light, under the sun
Under the sun, under the sun, under the sun.."
Knowledge stands upright, fear has no height
Work towards the star that gives off the brightest light
JBeez movin in a bright direction
Free of injury or evil infection
Stay out the dark and you'll find that you'll be strong
Believe in yourself and nothin will go wrong
There's room out there for those who want some
Because everybody's got a little light, under the sun
Hahahaha haha hahh!Embed
