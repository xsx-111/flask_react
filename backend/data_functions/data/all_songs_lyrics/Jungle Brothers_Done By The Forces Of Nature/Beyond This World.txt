Beyond This World Lyrics
"Breakdown..."

Round and round, upside down
Living my live underneath the ground
Never heard of and hardly seen
A whole lot of talk about the Red, Black and Green
So dirty you didn't wanna deal with it
So funky you didn't wanna get with it
But that's alright, no problem, cool
Sent to the Earth to educate the fool
Waiting around for my shell to crack
After that you can't hold me back
Looking out for the danger signs
Jungle Bros bringing forth a change in times
Left, right, some ask from which angle
Straight up the middle, reality's the riddle
Sendin' a message to the old and young
Confused about where I come from
What planet? What channel? What station?
AfriKa from the Zulu Nation...
Confused, no landing, no understanding
But I knew not to give what life was demanding
Found a new tab, thought I'd take a grab
Tired of brothers who feign to backstab
Beating a bigger drum, better days will come
And if they don't come, I'll get up and make some
First you crawl before you walk
First you think before you talk
I found in life that you wear a hard hat
Protect your mind and bad things will stay back
Vultures flocking around on corners
Snakes slide through our law and order
Years slip away and I get older
Leaves hit the ground and it gets colder
My heart pumps faster so I get bolder
That's when I ask my brother to...take over!
My mellow, Uncle Sam!
(Ladies and gentlemen, live from the Planet Rock we have the
J.Beeeeees...)
You see some listen but still don't hear
Some seem far but are real near
I climb a mountain to reach a kingdom
And if they're willing, sure I'll bring them
Think to the needy and then to the greedy
Rely on the heaven and earth to feed me
Move to the motions of the moon
(Take out your shades!) Cause the sun comes soon
To plan my day I look at the sky
I see rain and I still ask why...
Broke the airwaves, trying to make waves
Finally came through but came in mono
Frequencies I kept on fighting
Satelliting what I was writing
Three years, finally got through
Came through in stereo...
So hello everybody and how ya'll doing?
We gonna say a few words and keep on stepping
People watching to see what we would do
Live on air you heard us say to you:
The city's a jungle and we are the brothers
This so-called King Of The Jungle will run for cover
All of your minds have been set into a trance
So instead of fighting out our problems...
We order ya'll to dance!Embed
