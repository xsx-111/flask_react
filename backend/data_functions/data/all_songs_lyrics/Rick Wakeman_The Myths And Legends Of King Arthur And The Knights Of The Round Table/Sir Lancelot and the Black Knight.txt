Sir Lancelot and the Black Knight LyricsFight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Excalibur the sword of right
Lancelot you rise a knight
Many quests will soon be fought
To win your place in Arthur's court
Go to waste land if you dare
Lure the Black Knight from his lair
Fight and kill the evil man
Rid his evil from our land
Kneeling in prayer, Lancelot gave the night
Knowing to save the wasteland he must fight
Eager to kill all those who came his way
He must slay
He must fight
The Black Knight, the Black Knight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
The dawn approaches, clearing sky
Very soon a knight must die
Black Knight towering on his horse
Struck Lancelot with fearsome force
Lancelot held fast his ground
Then struck the Black Knight to the ground
Leapt from his horse and then he smote
A single thrust and pierced his throat
Answer my prayers, help me to save this land
Guide me by truth laid down by Arthur's hand
Evil is gone, only good we shall see
Victory
In this land
By God's hand
By God's handEmbed
