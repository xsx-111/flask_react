The Last Battle LyricsGone are the days of the knights
Of the Round Table and fights
Gallant men softly crying
Brave armies dying
The last battle soon to be lost
Hearing of great civil war
Saxons to Britain did pour
From the North and the East
Arthur's knights' death to feast
The last battle soon to be lost
"Come life or death," Arthur cried
Mordred the traitor he spied
Smote him into the ground
Where he fell without sound
And in rage lunged at Arthur who fell
Sir Hector, Sir Bors, Sir Bladwain and Sir Bleoboris, the only surviving Knights of the Round Table, ended their days after a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; soon after the Saxons conquered all of Britain and the realm of Logres was over. Many believed that Arthur would return to re-establish the holy realm of Logres and save Britain in the hour of its deadliest danger
About the year 1200 the monks of Glastonbury discovered the bones of Arthur buried near to those of Guinevere. Beneath the coffin a stone remained and there a cross bore the Latin inscription: "Here lies King Arthur in his tomb, with Guinevere, his wife, in the Isle of Avalon."
Gone are the days of the knights
Of the Round Table and fights
Of the realm of King Arthur
Peace ever after
Gone are the days of the knightsEmbed
