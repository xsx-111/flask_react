Guinevere LyricsLove me, my Guinevere
In my court, please be near
While our realm is dying
And brave knights are crying
Stay close by my side
Lancelot felt no fear
Loved his King's Guinevere
All his love he gave her
Fought through quests to save her
Love, showing the way
Guinevere
Golden tresses shining in the air
Spread against the jasper sea
Sorrow beheld her face
False love supplying grace
Knowing Arthur's fights
And his trusted knights
Meant more than his Queen
Guinevere
Golden tresses shining in the air
Spread against the jasper sea
Love me, my Guinevere
In my court, please be near
While our realm is dying
And brave knights are crying
Stay close by my side
Guinevere
Golden tresses shining in the air
Spread against the jasper seaEmbed
