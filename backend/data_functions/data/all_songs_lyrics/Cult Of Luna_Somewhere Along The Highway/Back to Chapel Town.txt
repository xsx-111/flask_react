Back to Chapel Town LyricsFloating over empty streets
Away from pain, away from everything
Pray that we will survive the night
Buildings falling, the soul vaporised
Watching you sleep, but I know
That your heart has grown cold
Let me dream if only for tonight
That we leave together in the first morning light
Alone and forgotten
I bow my head in shame
Before you all answers reveal
So I sink my sorrows in the sea
Pray that we will survive the night
Buildings falling, the soul vaporisedEmbed
