Thirtyfour LyricsIn her eyes he stares at his reflection
A faint dream, that disappeared at dawn
Standing at the shore patiently waiting
But the waves do not return when she is gone
So he followed her footsteps to
The highway that sealed his fate
The wind blew all sand away
Faceless people that walked astray
Behind the dunes false hope awaits
The ones that lost what was loved
So he followed her footsteps
To the highway that sealed his fate
So he followed her footsteps to
The highway that sealed his fate1Embed
