Dim LyricsFrom the skyline dark clouds move in
They shroud me with her cold cover
Eyes like daggers puncture the skin
Isolated in a room with no others
Where do I turn when all hope is lost?
Where do I find forgiveness?
My search for salvation has begun
To find a place where our hearts beat as oneEmbed
