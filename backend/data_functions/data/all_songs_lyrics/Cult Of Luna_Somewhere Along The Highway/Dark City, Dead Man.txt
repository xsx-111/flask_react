Dark City, Dead Man LyricsWhen the streetlights fade. Warm rain like judgement descends
Their voice numbs me. Speaking words in a dead tongue
I have walked a road that lead me back to you
From a window our glances met. My true colours I cannot hide
The landscape has changed. You don't recognise me
These pictures slowly fade. Memories wither, they are all gone
Further down the steps get steeper. You haunt me in my dreams
I let go and fall deeper. This will be the end of meEmbed
