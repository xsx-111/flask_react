Innocence LyricsWell, I lost my innocence today
I could feel her in my bones
My bones, my bones, my bones
My blood, my blood, my blood, my blood
And I woke up tired, scared, and sad
Soaked, drained, I felt so bad
Today, today, today
What you still, you still, you still, you still
Won't you say, you say, you say, you say
What you feel, you feel, you feel, you feel?
Which is nothing but hollow feelings, yeah
I can die, I just don't care
And forget happiness, I'm fine
I'll forget everything in time
I swear I didn't know
You know me, how I can't let go
And we're not gods, we're just hacks
All that life amongst the cracks
The scars, the siege that breaks
The ugliest scenes, the worst mistakes
And everywhere I see her face
Such a beautiful child
Such an awful waste
And there's no innocence like hers
Just emptiness and nerves
And this light from the window of my car
She'll never see it
Oh my God
I was so surprised
It blew up in my face
Lord, I lost my nerve
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my... God
And I tear, I tear
So hard
And I tear, I tear
So hard
And I'll beg and scream, "I was wrong!"
It's over, she's goneEmbed
