The Winning Side LyricsWell I've made some mistakes
At least privately, in takes
Here's another one
And I'd say "It'll be okay"
But that's a lie man, I mean, hey
We're all dying young
It's not a wish although it seems
More like a terrifying dream
And I'm serious
It's either whisky or a bong
Or a car crash or a bomb
I'm serious
Because the only thing I think
When I wake up in my bed
And my stomach churns
As these pages turn
Is the world burning?
Is it only in my head?
On the screen on the t.v
On a scene in front of me
With all the white noise and the static and the stifling of screams
This is war, this is death
This is real, you better bet
On the winning side
The winning side
The winning side
The winning side
And i'm sitting in a train
Over in Brooklyn in the rain
All by myself
When a thought occurs to me
That all these people wanna be just
Somewhere else
Like every day is just a loss
Spent arguing with your boss
Over a coffee break
Or the same is true for me
I mean one more indignity
And I'm going to break
Because the only thing I think
When he walks out on the screen
He says the sky falls
And your duty calls
Man, it takes some balls
To be so obscene
On the screen on a t.v
On a scene in front of me
With all the white noise and the static and the stifling of screams
This is war, this is death
This is real, you better bet
On the winning side
The winning side
The winning side
The winning side
The right side
The right side
Well they shipped you off
And your parents cried
It all falls away
So quietly
When you wake up to reality
A reality
What's reality?
What's reality?
What's reality?
IT'S A FUCKING BULLET!
Well I've got a brother in Iraq
I got no way to get him back
Like all those people in the sands
Buried in Afghanistan
I got a child in a crib
I got a father in a bib
I got no pills
I got no skills
I got no idea what I did
I just wonder every second
Every minute that passes by
Are we living?
Are we dreaming?
Are we winning?
Will we die
In a cloud of dust?
In a mushroom burst?
In a series of degradations first?
Or all alone in a hospital bed
Wondering what we might have done instead
With a lifetime
A lifetime
A lifetime
A lifetime
A lifetime
A lifetime
A lifetime
A lifetime
A lifetime
A lifetime
Well we paid our dues and we did our time
But could you tell me exactly what was our crime?
We're not standing still for this firing line
While you decide who lives, who dies
I hope you
CHOKE
ON
ALL
YOUR
LIESEmbed
