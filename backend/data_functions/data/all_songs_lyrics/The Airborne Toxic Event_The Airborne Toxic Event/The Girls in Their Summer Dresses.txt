The Girls in Their Summer Dresses Lyrics

It's so quiet on these windswept days
The city lights, the golden rays
The sunlight on the subway tracks
Are you mad again? If you like I'll take it back

They're just your feelings
I wasn't looking at her ass
Oh, do you mean it?

It's so lonesome, all this happenstance
If you asked me, yes, I'd like to dance
Just show me a glove-covered hand
A perfumed dress is more than I can stand

And you approach me
With your hollow hearted hand
And you tell me:

"It's not civilized, it's not fair to me
The blues, the greys, the olive greens
All take you far away from me
The girls in their summer dresses see"
Though you don't notice
They all look back at me
Is this on purpose?

Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no

I offer you this one olive branch
It's not as though they're always so keen
And we're both just the victims of circumstance
Do you understand, do you know what I mean?

Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no

I'm a husband first, I'm a childless curse
I'm a faithful man with a faceless thirst
I'll stay with you, oh please don't sigh
I try to explain, but you cry, and cry, and cry
And you hate me when I ask the reason why
You'll trade me a dollar for some sense
But don't blame me, I was only making sense
Oh I'm so sorry, I was only making senseEmbed
