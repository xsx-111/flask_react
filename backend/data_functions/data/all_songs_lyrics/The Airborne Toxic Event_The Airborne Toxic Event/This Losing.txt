This Losing LyricsStanding at your doorway
My stomach all tangled and tight
Have it your way
Oh God where are you tonight?
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing here
Or where to begin
Just take a deep breath
Oh darling don't let me in
A thousand times
We've said "I'm sorry, it's over again"
I can't live like this, feel like this
In my own skin
It all seems so degrading
And the morning such sin
Your face just like a child
Oh darling don't let me in
And we laugh just like children
And waiting in sheets on your bed
While we secretly pray like we're
Mourning the dead
And you tell me you're so weary
I know 'cause I'm weary too
And hold back a tear
Oh darling what are we to do?
And the wine, and the rain and the feel of your skin
Again, I'm swimming or flying or dying
This face, this fear
Just stay with me oh stay with me my dear
This hand, this glove
This only thing I love
This losing
This losing
This losing
This losing
This losing
This losing
