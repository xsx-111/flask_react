Something New LyricsWhat's passed these hands?
All these drugs and one night stands
So I tremble when I think of what she'd do
She'd say something like, "You're no good
You're like the junkies in this neighborhood"
We all need a fix, I guess I need one too
But I'm trying madly to calm these nerves with something new
I got this heavy debt, I've got nothing left
But this daunting weight slung 'round my neck
You got the callous mouth, all your endless doubts
We spent this fifteen weeks, trying to work it out
Do you think we're getting to something new?
Oh God, not another fight
I'm always trying to get the details right
I remember when you told me you felt saved
When you promised you'd lay flowers on my grave
Just like they used to do
Is it something new?
And now here I stand with these blood soaked hands
On this sleepless night, that never ends
And these songs I sing
With these hopes that I cling to
Desperately wondering
Are we finally getting to something new?
Is it something new?
Are we finally to something new?Embed
