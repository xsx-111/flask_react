Sail Away Lyrics
If you're drifting on an empty ocean
With no wind to fill your sail
The future, your horizon
It's like searching for the holy grail
You feel there's no tomorrow
As you look into the water below
It's only your reflection
And you still haven't got no place to go

Time will show
When, I don't know

Sail away tomorrow
Sailing far away
To find it steal or borrow
I'll be there someday
Yeah, yeah

Oh woman, I keep returning
To sing the same old song
The story's been told, now I'm getting old
Tell me, where do I belong?
Feel like I'm going to surrender
Hard times I've had enough
If I could find a place to hide my face
I believe, I could get back up
Time will show
When, I don't know

Sail away tomorrow
Sailing far away
To find it steal or borrow
But I'll be there someday
Yeah, yeah
Sail away tomorrow
Sailing far away
To find it steal or borrow
But I'll be there someday
Yeah, yeah
Sail away tomorrow
Sailing far away
To find it steal or borrow
But I'll be there someday
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
