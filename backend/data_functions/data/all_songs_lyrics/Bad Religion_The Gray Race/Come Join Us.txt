Come Join Us Lyrics
So you say you gotta know why the world goes around
And you can't find the truth in the things you've found
And you're scared shitless 'cause evil abounds
Come join us
Well I heard you were looking for a place to fit in
Full of adherent people with the same objective
A family to cling to and call brethren
Come join us

All we want to do is change your mind
All you need to do is close your eyes
Come join us
Come join us
Come join us

Don't you see the trouble that most people are in?
And that they just want you for their own advantage?
But I swear to you, we're different from all of them
Come join us
I can tell you are looking for a way to live
Where truth is determined by consensus
Full of codified, arbitrary directives
Come join us
All we want to have is your small mind
Turn it into one of our own kind
You can go through life adrift and alone
Desperate, desolate, on your own
But we're looking for a few more stalwart clones
Come join us
Come join us
Come join us

We've got spite and dedication as a vehement brew
The world hates us, well we hate them, too
But you're exempted, of course, if you
Come join us
Independent, self-contented, revolutionary
Intellectual, brave, strong and scholarly
If you're not one of them, you're us already so
Come join us
Come join us
Come join us
Come join us2Embed
