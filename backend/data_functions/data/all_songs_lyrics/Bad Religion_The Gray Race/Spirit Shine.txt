Spirit Shine Lyrics
Shed a tear for the criminal, give him something to believe
Light a fire for the miserable, give the darkness some meaning
Closed wounds harbor pestilence when you lick them from within
Charity has a redolence chastity cannot rescind

Spirit shine, it's a sign
Of a tortured mind
Spirit shine all the time
Can render you blind

You can take it all to heart or throw it all away
You can call it just a lark or live your life that way
You can give until you're dry and sucked of all your gleam
You can fake another cry and compromise your dream

Cling tight to the parable, let it dominate your life
Create a God who's infallible, give your leader some respite
Closed wounds harbor pestilence when you lick them from within
Rosy smiles lose their radiance when you take it on the chin

Spirit shine, it's a sign
Of a troubled mind
Spirit shine all the time
Can render you blindEmbed
