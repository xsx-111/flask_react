Punk Rock Song Lyrics
Have you been to the desert? Have you walked with the dead?
There's a hundred thousand children being killed for their bread
And the figures don't lie, they speak of human disease
But we do what we want and we think what we please
Have you lived the experience? Have you witnessed the plague?
People making babies sometimes just to escape
In this land of competition, the compassion is gone
Yet, we ignore the needy and we keep pushing on
Keep pushing on

This is just a punk rock song
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like ants in a colony, we do our share
But there's so many other fuckin' insects out there
And this is just a punk rock song

Have you visited the quagmire? Have you swam in the shit?
The party convention and the real politik
The face is always different, the rhetoric the same
But we swallow it all and we see nothing change
Nothing has changed
This is just a punk rock song
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like workers in a factory, we do our share
But there's so many other fuckin' robots out there
And this is just a punk rock song

Ten million dollars on a losing campaign
Twenty million starving and writhing in pain
Big, strong people, unwilling to give
Small in vision and perspective

One in five kids below the poverty line
One population runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time
This is just a punk rock song
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like ants in a colony, we do our share
But there's so many other fuckin' insects out there
And this is just a punk rock song
Figures don't lie, they speak of human disease
But we do what we want and we think what we please
One in five kids below the poverty line
One population runnin' out of time
This is just a punk rock song
This is just a punk rock song
This is just a punk rock song1Embed
