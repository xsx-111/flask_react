Them and Us Lyrics
Despite that he saw blatant similarity
He struggled to find a distinctive moiety
All he found was vulgar superficiality
But he focused it to sharpness
And shared it with the others
It signified his anger and misery

Them and us
Lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers
Them and us
Dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence
That there really is a difference between them and us

Hate is a simple manifestation
Of the deep-seated self-directed frustration
All it does is promote fear and consternation
It's the inability to justify the enemy
And it fills us all with trepidation

Them and us
Bending the significance to match a whimsied fable
Them and us
Tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence
A confused loose alliance, forming them and us
And I heard him say
We can take them all
We can take them all
We can take them all (That's what he said)
We can take them all
But he didn't know who we were
And he didn't know who they were
And there wasn't any reason or motive or value to his story
Just allegory, imitation glory
And a desperate, feeble search for a friend
Go!


Them and us
Lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers
Them and us
Dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence
Tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence
A confused loose alliance, forming them and us
We can take them all
We can take them all4Embed
