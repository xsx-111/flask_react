Ten in 2010 Lyrics
Parched, cracked mouths, empty swollen guts
Sun-baked pavement encroaches on us
Haves and have-nots together at last
Brutally engaged in mortal combat

Ten In 2010
Ten In 2010

What kind of God orchestrates such a thing?
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
Ten billion people all suffering
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
Truth is not an issue, just a hungry mouths to feed
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
Forget what you want, scrounge the things you need
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)

Ten In 2010
Ten In 2010

Ahhhh!
Happy and content, it can't happen to you
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
Fifteen years? We'll think of a solution!
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
It won't just appear one day
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
For ten in 2010, we're well on our way
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)

Ten In 2010
Ten In 2010
Like piercing ear darts, I heard the news today
Ten billion people coming your way
Ten In 20-
Ten In 20-
