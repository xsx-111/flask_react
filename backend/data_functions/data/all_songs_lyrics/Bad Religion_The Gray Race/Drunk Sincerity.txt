Drunk Sincerity Lyrics
The smell of virgin pages wafted through the swinging doors
And the croaking speech he'd heard from countless counselors before
They said "We all care for you, we know how you suffer
But I know you can succeed, I used to have it so much rougher"

There's hope in the words and emotion in the eyes
It's so easy to be misled by the savvy, gentle guise
And like fools, we trust the delivery
But it's all just drunk sincerity
It's all just drunk sincerity

In maternal family assembly, poised, regarding the blue tube
The numbers crept up higher and the hawks stayed out of view
Then the generals said, "We don't want our boys dead
Your sons and your husbands will be coming back heroes soon"

There's hope in the words and emotion in the eyes
It's so easy to be misled by the savvy, gentle guise
And like fools, we trust the delivery
But it's all just drunk sincerity
It's all just drunk sincerity
With steam, heat, and rhythm in the back seat of the car
And adolescent perspective, projecting life's forecast to the stars
You heard love from the lips and you were rapt by the hips
And the promise was eternal, but you couldn't see that far

There's hope in the words and emotion in the eyes
It's so easy to be misled by the savvy, gentle guise
And like fools, we trust the delivery
But it's all just drunk sincerity
It's all just drunk sincerity
It's all just drunk sincerity
It is all just drunk sincerityEmbed
