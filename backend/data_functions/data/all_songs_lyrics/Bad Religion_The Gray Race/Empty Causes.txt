Empty Causes Lyrics
Everywhere you looked
There was confusion violence, drama and drugs
So many righteous revolutionaries spouting utopian love
Everyone shrouded in purple haze
Then one day, they woke up from their dream state
They found themselves no more at peace than before
Older, meek and conformed

Empty causes
A bluster for the soul, a fix for the mind
Empty causes
Cling to everything you find

Well, the shots rang out like popcorn
And the Chief was hit and rushed out of sight
The mohawk-chain, leather brigade
Rejoiced maliciously on that night
Someone cried out, "fuck the government"
His mates couldn't define what he meant
So no one gave him the time of day and the scene died away

Empty causes
A war for the body, an army in the mind
Empty causes
Losing steam as time goes by
Could it be that everybody selfishly desires
Their own personal retinue
And that causes are just manifestations of too much time
And far to little to do?

Empty causes
Direction for the soul, conviction for the mind
Empty causes
Cling to it all, everything you find
Empty causes
A war for the body and an army in the mind
Empty causes
You've got yours and I've got mineEmbed
