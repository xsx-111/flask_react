Treasures LyricsJah we love and not another
One world for all the people on the face of the Earth
One time while I be in life
These are the visions, reality
God is his majesty
Open your ears and open heart
And listen to these words part of a universal message to all nations
God is a respecter of no one, giver of all my lord
The treasure of righteousness is love
The treasure of righteousness is love
The treasure of righteousness is love
The treasure of righteousness is loveEmbed
