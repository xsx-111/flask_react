Swingtown Lyrics
Ooo oooohhhh
Ooo oooohhhh
Come on and dance, come on and dance
Let's make some romance
You know the night is falling
And the music's calling
And we've got to get down to Swingtown

We've been working so hard
We've been working so hard
Come on, baby
Come on, baby, let's dance

Ooo oooohhhh
Ooo oooohhhh
Come on and dance, come on and dance
We may not get another chance
You know the night is falling
And the music's calling
And we've got to get down to Swingtown1Embed
