The Stake Lyrics
Burning, burning all you can take
Wheels are turning in the bed you make
I'll take you over
You're tied at the stake
Nobody loves you like the way I do

Light rain's over
The sun's all around
Four leaf clover
As I pull you down
I'll take you over
You're tied at the stake
Nobody loves you like the way I do
Nobody loves you like the way I do

Nobody loves you like the way I doEmbed
