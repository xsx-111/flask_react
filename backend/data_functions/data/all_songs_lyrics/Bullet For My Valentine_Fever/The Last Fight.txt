The Last Fight Lyrics
I don't wanna stand beside you
I don't wanna try and feel the pain you're going through
Till the death you'll see this through
Cold sweats, hallucinations
I wanna scream to show
The hell I'm going through
The addiction's taking you

Can you see me through bloodshot eyes (through bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight for what is right or let it die?
Now I'm choking on force fed lies
Do I fight or let it die?

I will fight!
One more fight!
Don't break down in front of me (I will fight!)
Will you fight?
I am not the enemy
I will try one last time
Are you listening to me? (I will fight)
The last fight
I am not your enemy
Everyone is sick of caring
No silver lining on the cloud that covers you
Let it pour and soak you through
No hope, just desperation
So sit and wait for death
And pray it takes you soon
The addiction's taking you

Can you see me through bloodshot eyes (through bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight for what is right or let it die?
Now I'm choking on force fed lies
Do I fight or let it die?

I will fight!
One more fight!
Don't break down in front of me (I will fight!)
Will you fight?
I am not the enemy
I will try, one last time
Are you listening to me? (I will fight!)
The last fight
I am not your enemy

Can you feel me through bloodshot eyes (through bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight another night or let it die?
Now I'm choking on every lie
Do I fight or let it die?!

I will fight!
One more fight!
Don't break down in front of me (I will fight!)
Will you fight?
I am not the enemy
I will try, one last time
Are you listening to me? (I will fight!)
The last fight
I am not your enemy

I am not your, not your enemy!
I am not your enemyEmbed
