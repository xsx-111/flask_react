Your Betrayal Lyrics
Am I going insane?
My blood is boiling inside of my veins
An evil feeling attacks (attacks)
My body's shaking, there's no turning back
Don't take your eyes off the trigger!
I'm not to blame if your world turns to black
As your eyes start to blister!
There's just no hope for our final embrace

So here we are
I'm in your head
I'm in your heart!

You were told to run away
Soak the place, and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!
I was told to stay away
Those two words I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!

Is it my turn to die?
My heart is pounding as I say goodbye
So now I dance in the flames
I love you crying and screaming my name
You said that we'd be forever!
How could you kill me and lie to my face?
Now that we can't be together!
There's just no hope for our final embrace
So here we are
I'm in your head
I'm in your heart!

You were told to run away
Soak the place, and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!
I was told to stay away (stay away)
Those two words I can't obey (can't obey)
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!

Go!
Ooh-ah-aah
Ooh-ah-aah
Ooh-ah-aah
Ooh-ah-aah

So here we are (so here we are)
I'm in your head (I'm in your head)
I'm in your heart!
You were told to to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!
I was told to stay away (stay away)
Those two words I can't obey (can't obey)
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!8Embed
