Begging for Mercy Lyrics
Yeah!
Oh!

Waking up with just one thing in mind
Eyes sewn shut so tear them open wide
I'm on the hunt, I'm on the prowl, I can almost taste you now
I'm on your scent, I'll track you down. I'm on you now

Drain your blood, watch it pour!
Drain your blood, plead no more!

Please forgive me (please forgive me), I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me, stop begging for your mercy
Please forgive me (please forgive me), I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me, stop begging for your mercy

Can you feel the pain, the smell of fear surrounds you
Do you want to scream? Let it out because no one can hear you
I'm on the hunt, I'm on the prowl. I can almost taste you now
I'm on your scent, I'll track you down. I'm on you now
Drain your blood, watch it pour!
Drain your blood, plead no more!

Please forgive me (please forgive me), I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me, stop begging for your mercy
Please forgive me (please forgive me), I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me, stop begging for your mercy


Drain your blood, watch it pour!
Drain your blood, plead no more!


Please forgive me (please forgive me), I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me, stop begging for your mercy
Please forgive me (please forgive me), I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me, stop begging for your mercyEmbed
