Pretty on the Outside Lyrics
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

So you want to play games with my head?
But you make me fall apart, I wish that I was dead
I just can't believe I fell, for such a blackened heart
You played me for a fool and used me from the start
Fuck you! (fuck you!), I just want to know the truth
But the words from your mouth they just cloud
All the negativity, forces me down into (silence)
But still I can dream
I want to know
I want to know

If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty?
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty?
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you're only
Pretty on the outside

Now I fucking hate you, with all of my heart
So just disappear, and never will I fear for my life
I just want to be alone
And never, no never, will I be unhappy alone
I want to know
I want to know
If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty?
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty?
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you're only
Pretty on the outside

You're so pretty on the outside
You're so pretty on the outside
So you want to play games with my head
But you make me fall apart, and wish that I was dead
Can't believe I fell for such a blackened heart
You played me for a fool and just used me from the start
I just want to know the truth (but the words from your mouth!)
All your negativity (you keep forcing me down!)
Into silence I can dream (into silence I can dream!)
Into silence I can dream!

If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty? (pretty!)
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty? (pretty!)
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you're only
Pretty on the outside
Whoa-oh-oh, you're so pretty on the outside
Whoa-oh-oh, you're so pretty on the outside!
You're so pretty on the outside!Embed
