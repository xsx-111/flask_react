Alone Lyrics
Yeah!

No more of taking this hatred from you
You make me feel dead when I'm talking to you
You'll take me for granted when I'm not around
So burn all your bridges
'Cause I'm not going down (down)

This time I will be heard
I'm not going to burn
It's funny how the table, how the table turns

You fake (fake!) your damnation
You pray (pray!) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone

I hope you're unhappy and hurting inside
I want you to choke when you swallow your pride
Lay in your coffin and sleep with your sins
Give me the nails and I'll hammer them in
Right now
This time you won't be heard
You are gonna burn
It's funny how the table, how the table turns

You fake (fake!) your damnation
You pray (pray!) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone
You fake (fake!) your damnation
You pray (pray!) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Go!

This time you won't be heard
You are gonna burn
It's funny how the table, how the table turns

You fake (fake!) your damnation
You pray (pray!) for salvation (for salvation)
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone
You fake (fake!) your damnation
You pray (pray!) for salvation (for salvation)
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone

Woah-oh-oh-oh
You can die and rot alone
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Just die and rot alone
This time you won't be heard (this time you won't be heard)
This time you won't be heard6Embed
