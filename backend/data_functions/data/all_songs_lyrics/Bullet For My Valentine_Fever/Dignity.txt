Dignity Lyrics
So society just can't let us be
Please don't be ashamed
We are not to blame
The future's ours to take
We will make mistakes
Scream this loud and proud
We will not back down!

So lets go and relieve some pressure
Anarchy will only make it better
We can't, we won't surrender
We can't, we won't surrender!
We're not scared because we like the danger
Reality will only make us stronger
We can't, we won't surrender
We can't, we won't surrender!

Don't tell me where I will lay in your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me cause I won't go quietly
I'd rather die with dignity

Let them put us down
Hope we're not around
They pray we go away
But we're here to stay
Time is on our side
Our two worlds collide
These four words might help
Just go fuck yourself!
So lets go and relieve some pressure
Anarchy will only make it better
We can't, we won't surrender
We can't, we won't surrender!
We're not scared because we like the danger
Reality will only make us stronger
We can't, we won't surrender
We can't, we won't surrender!

Don't tell me where I will lay in your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me cause I won't go quietly
I'd rather die with dignity

Dignity!


Don't tell me where I will lay in your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me because I won't go quietly
I'd rather die with dignity
Don't tell me where I will lay in your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me because I won't go quietly
I'd rather die with dignityEmbed
