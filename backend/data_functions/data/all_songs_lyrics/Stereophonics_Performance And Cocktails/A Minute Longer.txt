A Minute Longer Lyrics
They're calling out
Come on lets go
But I'm miles away
To a year before
Laughs from a glass
Drank to the past
On the old green seat
Like velvet to the hand

Think I'd like to stay a minute longer
Would you like to stay a minute longer

Last one for some
Sick from the rum
I play golf on the carpet with someone
Crash back to date
Few things I hate
But I'd rather us live
In the present day

Think I'd like to stay a minute longer
Would you like to stay a minute longer

Think I'd like to stay a minute longer
Would you like to stay a minute longer

If you like i stay a minute longer
If you like i stay a minute longer
Its a longer
Its a longer
Its a longer
LongerEmbed
