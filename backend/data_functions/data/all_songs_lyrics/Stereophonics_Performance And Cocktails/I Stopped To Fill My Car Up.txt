I Stopped To Fill My Car Up LyricsI stopped to fill my car up
The car felt good that day
I didn't know where i was going
But it felt good for a change
A five and a pocket full of silver
I paid the lady no change
And then it started to piss down
I started driving again
And then i looked up
And looked in the mirror behind me
A man round forty in the back seat
Must have stepped in when I was empty
So why's he sat there just waiting
Likely to smash my face in
He had a bag full of money
He said just drive me away
I didn't know where I was going
Yet it felt good to be strange
And still I look up
And look in the mirror behind me
Curiosity is over
He stepped down from the car
He pulled a gun out from his jacket
Said I was going to die
It gives me so much satisfaction
To watch you beg and cry
Well I just made up this story
To get your attention makes me smile
I never looked up or looked
In the mirror behind me1Embed
