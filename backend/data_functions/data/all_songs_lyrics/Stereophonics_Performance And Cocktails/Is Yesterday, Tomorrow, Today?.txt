Is Yesterday, Tomorrow, Today? LyricsIt's another way, to get through the day
Picking up ripped cigarette boxes hoping that one remains
Yellow lucky day, suck deep and bathe
For the next ten minutes spent coughing all the pleasures craved
Write down all the things that you'd like to say
Write down all the things that you'd like to change
Write down all the places you'd like to stay
Write down anything that you want
Is yesterday, tomorrow, today?
Is nothing gonna change the way?
Cracked rock top wall, left the ash to fall, left alone to wait
I've never looked at things I've liked only things I hate
You're not the first today, not the softest face
Was there any that you liked? was there any that you didn't fake?
Write down all the things that you'd like to be
Write down all the things that you don't believe
Write down all the places you'd like to see
Write down anything that you want
Is yesterday, tomorrow, today?
Is nothing gonna change the way?
Because, everything that's you
And the things that you like to do
And all of the things that are
Come back again, come back again
Come back again, come back again
Come back again
Is yesterday, tomorrow, today?Embed
