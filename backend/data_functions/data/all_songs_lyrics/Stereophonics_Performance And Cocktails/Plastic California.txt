Plastic California LyricsPlastic California
Looks like Blackpool
Outta date
Some love, some hate
It's all your competition
It's not my occupation, true
But it's what you do
Some love, some hate
Some love, some hate
I like pink architecture
Flip back my red strip deck chair, prove
We got nothing to prove
Gin stroke amnesia problems
Over hearing talk of Hollywood
We wish we could, ya should
Some love and some hate
Some love and some hate
It's a beautiful place for nature
And all the beautiful people make it true
But you look as good as you
Some love and some hate
Some love and some hate
Makes me feel great
Makes me feel great
I feel new
D'ya feel new? ha, ha!
D'ya feel new? ha, ha!
D'ya feel new? ha, ha!
Ha, ha!
Well I'm pleased to meet you!Embed
