She Takes Her Clothes Off LyricsShe's got another fantasy
She lives in flat number twenty three
Picked first prize for carnival queen
And now she takes her clothes off
Collects the covers of her magazines
She longs to be another teenage dream
The problem is she's turning forty three
She still takes her clothes off
She got the nickname porta bubble Joan
They found her dead, dead as nails at home
And she said, I'm gonna be another Marilyn
Bleach my hair and get real thin
And everybody's gonna wanna dance with me
She loved to have her little fantasies
She longed to be the wife of Jimmy Dean
But Jimmy's head sits in Jimmy's knees
She loves to take her clothes off
Police are looking around at twenty three
They found her hanging from her swollen feet
They saw her dance last in Woolworth street
She loved to take her clothes off
She got the nickname porta bubble Joan
They found her dead, dead as nails at home
And she said, I'm gonna be another Marilyn
Bleach my head and get real thin
And everybody's gonna wanna dance with me
Everybody's gonna wanna dance with me
Everybody wants to be the carnival queen
Everybody's gonna wanna dance with me
Everybody wants to be the carnival king or queen
We all read the books
She takes her clothes off
One by one, one by one, off againEmbed
