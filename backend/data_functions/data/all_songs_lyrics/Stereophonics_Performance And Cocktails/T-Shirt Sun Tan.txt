T-Shirt Sun Tan LyricsHe was walking round to you
One said french afternoon
So he called in to shop for two
He bought himself an ice drink
A totally tropical nice drink
Then he saw what he thought was you in a room
He thought about going over
But you were always much older
And your sex dressed breasts impressed too
He'd really like to get it together
Before the twelfth of never
So he's coming over
It's when all the phases come around the clothes you wear
The sex and love
It's enough
For the time
Outta touch
Out of luck
He always liked them older
So that his top lip touched on her shoulder
Lionized undisguised kill for you
Like to show you his t-shirt sun tan
Love to show you his minute head stand
Then a gun spun open
It's when all the phases come around the clothes you wear
The sex and love
It's enough
For the time
Outta touch
Out of luck
It's when all the phases come around the clothes you wear
The sex and love
It's enough
For the time
Outta touch
Out of luck
From you to me, to me to you
From you to me, to me to you
From you to me, to me to you
From you to me, to me to you
It's when all the phases come around the clothes you wear
The sex and love
It's enough
For the time
Outta touch
Out of luck
It's when all the phases come around the clothes you wear
The sex and love
It's enough
For the time
Outta touch
Out of luck
Out of luck
