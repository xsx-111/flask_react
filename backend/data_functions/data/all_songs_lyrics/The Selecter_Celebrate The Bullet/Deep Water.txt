Deep Water LyricsDeepwater, deepwater
I'm in trouble and I'm up to my neck again
Deepwater, deepwater
I'm out of money and it's banked by the fat fish
Opening and closing their mouths
But there's no sound in my ears
I never wanted to be in deepwater again
Deepwater, deepwater
Too hard to sleep with my eyes open
Deepwater, deepwater
Crying ice cold tears, a drop in the ocean
Killer sharks watching my every move
Echoes of someone laughing at me
I never wanted to be in deepwater again
Deepwater, drifting miles and miles and miles away
Deepwater, drifting miles and miles and miles away
Deepwater, drifting miles and miles and miles away
Away, away
Deepwater, deepwater
Drown my sorrows with too many blues
Deepwater, deepwater
Sometimes I've had to cast away my pride
Like a prisoner on an island wachin the tide
Cut-off, shut-off, no-one holds the key
I never wanted to be in deepwater again
Deepwater, drifting miles and miles and miles away
Deepwater, drifting miles and miles and miles away
Deepwater, drifting miles and miles and miles away
Away, away
Deepwater, drifting downstream
Won't you throw me a rope
Deepwater, fighting the current
Staring at your boat
Deepwater, drifting miles and miles and miles away
Deepwater, drifting miles and miles and miles away
Deepwater, drifting miles and miles and miles away
Away, awayEmbed
