(Who Likes) Facing Situations LyricsDon't just sit there I'm bored and so are you
All you do is go on and on
Why worry if things are okay
It's a funny situation
Who's innocence is all of this guilt
Why think there's always someone else to blame
But you still don't care if it doesn't reach you
If it doesn't reach you
Can't you see what it means to be me
I can't seem to get through to you and me
We are in constant incommunicado, incommunicado, incommunicado
Just when I thought I must be numb to the pain
They're still tampering inside
But you still don't care
If it doesn't reach you
If it doesn't reach you
Boy me neck hot and sweaty- in the heat-in the city
People just piss around and let me down
Never meaning what they say
Each and every day
Just when I thought it-it-it
Here you take itEmbed
