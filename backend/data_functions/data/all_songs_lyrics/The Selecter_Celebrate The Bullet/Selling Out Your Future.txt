Selling Out Your Future LyricsSwitching on the city lighting
All the homes feel so secure
'Cause the west is ever caring
She can keep your home fires burning
Switching to a bedroom lighting
Hiding low you're insecure
Hand around the candle you say
There's no more joy to come tomorrow
Caught in the act
You were taking your time
You said nothing would change
Nothing would change so
Nothing would
Selling out your future
Selling out your future
Drew the curtains shut the lights out
Slept alone upon the floor
But you couldn't stop the drought creeping
Underneath the front door
You ignored the press gang selling
Lottery tickets at the stairs
But you already sold your hat for
A dark green helmet yesterday
Caught in the trap
You had nothing to choose
You saw everything lost
You had nothing to say
Nothing to say, so nothings said
Selling out your future
Selling out your future
Switching on the city lighting
All the homes feel so secure
'Cause the west is ever caring
She can keep the camera staring
Switching on your colour vision
Smiling faces lie to you
Faded voices crying 'Fall into line
The 'Fall out', comes tomorrow
Caught in the trap
You were taking your time
They were buying your mind
You had nothing to say
Nothing to say, so nothings said
Selling out your future
Selling out your futureEmbed
