Bristol and Miami LyricsCafe on the corner peeling painted sign
Water in he vinegar and it never changes to wine
Causing no fuss just smoking inside
Heavy light bursts in and the shadows rush to hide
Then Bristol caught fire
Smell of burning in the air
Everybody listening to the reggae jukebox singer singing
Sing on, sing on
Listen to the echo of the street
Sing on, sing on
Listen to the echo of the street
Four thousand miles to the west
People only take so much
When surrounded by the best they want to reach out and touch
Miami beach hot and lazy
Sun a yellow ball of light
Hiding invisible men living in a world of white
Bristol and Miami
Where's it gonna be tomorrow
Anytime, anywhere
It's only time we borrow
Sun beat down, hot heavy afternoon
Hurricane swept the town, and didn't finish so soon
Black smiles thrown in the dust
Replaced by anger
White grins begin to rust when
They're looking in the face of danger
Then Miami caught fire
Smell of burning in the air
Everybody listening to the reggae jukebox singer singing
Sing on, sing on
Listen to the echo of the street
Sing on, sing on
Listen to the echo of the street
Black man singing in the heat of the night
Broken dreams just fly away
Everybody listening to the reggae jukebox singer singing
Sing on, sing on
Listen to the echo of the street
Sing on, sing on
Listen to the echo of the street
Black man singing in the heat of the night
Broken dreams just fly awayEmbed
