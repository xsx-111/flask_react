Whisper LyricsI saw you coming but I ducked out the way
Down some alley that's never seen the day
The sun is shining and I'm feeling pretty bad
I've heard the rumors the gossip and spite
You wanna leave me and do what you like
Maybe you never loved me anyway
Money in my pocket and nowhere to go
Places I think of are so, so, so
Meeting people I just don't want to meet
Today don't shape up as the best I ever had
I'm out tonight looking for some bad action
But I can't get no satisfaction
Shh, it's just a whisper
Shh, it's just a whisper
Shh, it's just a whisper
It's just a quiet thing, but it don't bother me
I tell myself it is nothing to me
I've heard the rumors the gossip and spite
You wanna leave me and do what you like
Maybe you never loved me anyway
Today don't shape up as the best I ever had
I'm out tonight looking for some bad action
But I can't get no satisfaction
Shh, it's just a whisper
Shh, it's just a whisper
Shh, it's just a whisper
It's just a quiet thing, but it don't bother me
I tell myself it is nothing to meEmbed
