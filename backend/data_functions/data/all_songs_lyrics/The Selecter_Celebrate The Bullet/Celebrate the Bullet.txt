Celebrate the Bullet LyricsCelebrate the bullet
Put your finger on the trigger
But you don't have to pull it
'Cause you know it won't bring them
Back to you, back to you
Celebrate the bullet
But you have to snigger
You told 'em all to shove it
'Cause you know it won't bring them
Back to you, back to you
Celebrate the bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet
Celebrate the bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet
Celebrate the bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet
Celebrate the bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet
Celebrate the bullet
Put your finger on the trigger
But you don't have to pull it
'Cause you know it won't bring them
Back to you, back to you
Celebrate the bullet
It all seems to get much bigger
Do you really have to prove it
'Cause you know it won't bring them
Back to you, back to you
Celebrate the bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet
Celebrate the bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet
Celebrate the bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet
Celebrate the bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bulletEmbed
