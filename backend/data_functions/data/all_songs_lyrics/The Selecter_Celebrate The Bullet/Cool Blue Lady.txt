Cool Blue Lady LyricsCool blue lady sing your song
Twist your heart out it won't take long
Yeah you wonder just what it's all for
No one would tell you they watch to see you fall
Cool blue lady cool blue lady
Cool blue lady, cool blue lady
Cool blue lady you tried so hard
How could those people play you like a card
There's so much pain from what you got inside
Makes you want to want to run and hide
Cool blue lady, cool blue lady
Cool blue lady, cool blue lady
Cool blue lady how you sang the blues
When you loved how come no-one loved you
You told your secrets and gave a lot of soul
Seems like you had an impossible goal
Cool blue lady, cool blue lady
Cool blue lady, cool blue ladyEmbed
