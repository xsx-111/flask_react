Red Reflections LyricsStretched out on the sofa
Making witty conversation
Instant coffee in the cups
Then the milk went sour
Now honesty was all I wanted
Enough warmth to mix it right
Didn't want my loving on the rocks
But couldn't melt the ice
Then the door shut
And the mirror falls
My jagged image
Rests against the wall
And I see
Red reflections in the mirror of the night
The mirror shows all your secrets
Puts all your fears on view
It always plays its jokes
Only when you're looking at you
And if loneliness was a colour
It would be white
But all I see is red reflections
In the mirror of the night
The mirror shows all your secrets
Puts all your fears on view
The darkness lights your eyes
In the quiet I hear a thousand sighs
Then the door slams shut
And the mirror falls
My jagged image
Rests against the wall
And I see
Red reflections in the mirror of the nightEmbed
