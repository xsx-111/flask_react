Washed Up and Left For Dead LyricsIt's common knowledge there's always one exception
Not quite a part of the crowd
He tries so hard, just to laugh in the right places
But he knows it's just not funny
He has this feeling, he just knows it
They don't like him 'cos he's different
He knew all about the no-go areas
But he went there just the same
He was washed up and left for dead
Nobody told him he was just not wanted
It got so cold after midnight
Oh yeah
Don't want the money
He just wants the fame
There's something driving him inside
His friends don't like him
'cos they think that he's so stupid
So he just goes out on his own
He saw a movie that night and it moved him
It was just like his life story
But he got jumped by some thugs
On the way home
No-one came to his rescue
He was washed up and left for dead
Nobody told him he was just not wanted
It gets so cold after midnight
Oh yeah
Night after night he's out biting the pavement
Hurt his hands clapping for the group
He can't dance, but he can certainly cause trouble
Yeah, ah -ooh
He was washed up and left for dead
Nobody told him he was just not wanted
It gets so cold after midnight
Oh yeahEmbed
