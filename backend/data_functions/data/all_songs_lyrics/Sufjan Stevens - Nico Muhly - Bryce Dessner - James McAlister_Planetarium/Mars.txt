Mars LyricsIn the future, there will be no war
The loneliness outside
And the stones cry out for mercy
Will they see the Lord
The prophecy cross-eyed
As it is written, I am the god of war
I reside in every creature
Dispose of the future
Or put away your sword

In the future, there will only be war
Profanity outside
And after all the devastation
Will we see the Lord
As it is written
I'm the producer, I'm the god of war
I reside in every creature
Dispose of the future
Or put away your sword
Love, peace, forgiveness and consequence and trust
And patience, affection, determining how
Love, I hold you in as compensate, contemplate
Rhapsody and energy and hope, the things to look for
Love, peace, forgiveness and consequence and trust
And patience, affection, determining how
Love, I hold you in as compensate, contemplate, rhapsody
And energy and hope, the things to look for
Love, I hold you in as fantasy, blasphemy, fallacy and probably as fate
The things we do for loveEmbed
