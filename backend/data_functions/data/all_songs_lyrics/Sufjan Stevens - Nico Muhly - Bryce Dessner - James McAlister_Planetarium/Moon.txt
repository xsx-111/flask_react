Moon LyricsJack rabbit jumped with a generous mood
Offering himself on the fire for food
Touched by his virtue, the fortune approved
Outlining ears on the fortress moon
As I'm about to enter your world
As I'm about to enter your world
I give you light
Some say the crane was the culprit too
Stretched by the weight as her legs withdrew
Carrying the chariot, the rabbit assumed
Brushing her face with the red-headed hubris
As I'm about to enter your world
As I'm about to enter your world
I give you bloodEmbed
