Pluto LyricsJupiter bad June
You know my arms ache
And I’ve organized my face
Sweet sun sister moon
Seasons have shown
How your providence takes shape
My little eyeshadow
Bruised by the moon's battle
Lipstick, eyeliner replaced
Charon the fog lifted
Messenger dwarfism
Let’s leave evidence to rest
Pluto silly goose
Why did you hide behind covenants of shame?
Smooth and splendid abuse
Won’t you tell me how to deal with my own?
Sworn by Persephone, how melancholy she
Waits forever in your kiss
Loneliest passageway, orbiting castaway
Beat your beauty at your breast
Don’t surprise me you monster, you mastery
Make your very last requestEmbed
