Uranus LyricsWhat are you now?
Castrated by your son
The odd spring scattered on the deep
From Aphrodesia
You sexless fraud
From chaos choreographed
Defiled us in a fit of rage
The earth will find its way
Violent storm, from mysterious vengeance lies
Born from incest, as the evidence flipped its eyes
Cross me with your wildness, snake-eyed warrior's knife
Aquarius, the scorpion
Your venom kiss, my guardian
I trust your touch, I trust your cries
Render the knife, cut off my kind
My, you, they, we, us
My, you, they, we, us
My, you, they, we, us
My, you, they, we, usEmbed
