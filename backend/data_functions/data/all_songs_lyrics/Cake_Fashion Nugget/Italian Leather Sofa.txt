Italian Leather Sofa Lyrics
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in

She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
They laugh they make money
He's got a gold watch
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa

She doesn't care whether or not he's a good man
She doesn't care just as long as she still has her friends

She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
They laugh, they make money
He's got a gold watch
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa

She's got a serrated edge
That she moves back and forth
It's such a simple machine
She doesn't have to use force
When she gets what she wants
She puts the rest on a tray in a ziplock bag
She's got a serrated edge
That she moves back and forth
It's such a simple machine
She doesn't have to use force
When she gets what she wants
She puts the rest on a tray in a ziplock bag
...in the freezer

She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in
Alright, here it comes, here it comes...

She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
They laugh, they make money
He's got a gold watch
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa2Embed
