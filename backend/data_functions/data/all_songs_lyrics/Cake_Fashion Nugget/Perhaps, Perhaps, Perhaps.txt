Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps LyricsYou won't admit you love me
And so
How am I ever
To know
You only tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
A million times I ask you
And then
I ask you over
Again
You only answer
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna' wind up
Being parted, broken hearted
So if you really love me
Say yes
But if you don't, dear
Confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna' wind up
Being parted, broken hearted
So if you really love me
Say yes
But if you don't, dear
Confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
Perhaps, perhaps, perhapsEmbed
