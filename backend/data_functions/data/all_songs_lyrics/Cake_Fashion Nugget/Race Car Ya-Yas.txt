Race Car Ya-Yas LyricsThe land of race car ya-yas
The land where you can't change lanes
The land where large, fuzzy dice
Still hang proudly
Like testicles from rear-view mirrors
The land of race car ya-yas
The land where you can't change lanes
The land where large, fuzzy dice
Still hang proudly
Like testicles from rear-view mirrors
The land of race car ya-yas
Ya-yas
The land of race car ya-yas
The land of race car ya-yas
Race car ya-yasEmbed
