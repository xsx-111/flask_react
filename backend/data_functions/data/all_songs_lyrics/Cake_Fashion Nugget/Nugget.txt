Nugget LyricsOkay alright, uh no
This one, this one, this one
Heads of state, who ride and wrangle
Who look at your face, from more than one angle
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives through Chicken McNuggets
Now heads of state, who ride and wrangle
Who look at your face, from more than one angle
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives through chicken McNuggets
Shut the fuck up, no
Shut the fuck up
(Shut the fuck)
Right, right
Learn to buck up
(Shut the fuck)
Right, shut the fuck up
Hey ho
(Shut the fuck)
Now, now
Learn to buck up
(Oh)
One, two, one two three four
Alright
Now, nimble fingers that dance on numbers
Will eat your children and steal your thunder
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl
Will crunch like nuts in the mouth of squirrels
Now, nimble fingers that dance on numbers
Will eat your children and steal your thunder
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl
Will crunch like nuts in the mouth of squirrels
Shut the fuck up, no
Shut the fuck up
(Shut the fuck)
Right, now
Learn to buck up
(Shut the fuck)
Right, shut the fuck up
Hey ho, ya
(Shut the fuck)
Ya ya
Learn to buck up
Now, simple feet that flicker like fire
And burn like candles in smoky spires
Do more to turn, my joy to sadness
Than somber thoughts of burning planets
Now, clever feet that flicker like fire
And burn like candles in smoky spires
Do more to turn, my joy to sadness
Than somber thoughts of burning planets
(Shut the fuck)
Alright, okay I don't
(Shut the fuck)
Wanna, I don't wanna hear it
That's right
(Shut the fuck)
Oh, okay I don't wanna
(Shut the fuck)
I don't wanna
(Shut the fuck)
Hey, ho, ya
(Shut the fuck)
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
(Yea, one two one two one)5Embed
