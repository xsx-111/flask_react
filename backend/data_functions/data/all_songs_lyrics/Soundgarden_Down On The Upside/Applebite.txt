Applebite Lyrics
(Only forever..)
(It's only forever..)

No one can save the pure or the brave
No one can save them at all
Grow and decay
Grow and decay

It's only forever
It's only forever

Loosely and tightly, everything fits
Even the wrist of your arm
Grow and decay
Growing today

It's only forever
It's only forever
It's only forever
It's only forever
It's only
It's only forever
It's only forever
