Tighter & Tighter Lyrics
Shadow face
Blowing smoke and talking wind
Lost my grip
Fell too far to start again, start again
A sudden snake
Found my shape and tells the world
Remember this
Remember everything's just black or burning sun

And I hope it's a sweet ride
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone

Warm and sweet
Swinging from a window's ledge
Tight and deep
One last sin before I'm dead, before I'm dead
A sucking holy wind
Will take me from this bed tonight
And bloody wits
Another hits me and I have to say goodbye
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone

And I hope it's a sweet ride
Here for me tonight
'Cause I feel I'm going
Feel I'm slowing down

Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
And I hope it's a sweet ride
Here for me tonight
'Cause I feel I'm going
Feel I'm slowing down2Embed
