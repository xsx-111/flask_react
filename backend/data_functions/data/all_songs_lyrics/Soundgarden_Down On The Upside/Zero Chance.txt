Zero Chance Lyrics
I think I know the answer
I stumbled on and all the world fell down
And all the sky went silent
Cracked like glass and slowly tumbled to the ground

They all say if you look hard
You'll find your way back home
Born without a friend
And bound to die alone

I'm thinking of your highness
And crying long upon the loss I've found
And on the plus and minus
Zero chance of ever turning this around

Why doesn't anyone believe in loneliness?
Stand up and everyone will see your holiness

They all say if you look hard
You'll find your way back home
Born without a friend
And bound to die alone1Embed
