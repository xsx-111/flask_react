Overfloater Lyrics
Come on in and take me on an override
Stuck inside and up all night at Dave's
Trouble's far away, Mother's in the cage
Nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine

I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right

Close the door and pull the shades and climb the walls
Feel medicine heal the lines of age
Here and now, I'm gone, there and far beyond
Nothing's going to pinch this nerve of mine
Nothing's going to pinch this nerve of mine

I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right

I'm on the wire, over and higher
Over the pretense, over the spire
On and connected
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating
Alone, alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone
Breathe and take it in and gently blow it on
Drink it down and swallow hard and gaze
Roll the potion up, stare your shadow down
Remember to forget and then rename your shame

I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right

I'm on the wire, over and higher
Over the pretense, over the spire
On and connected
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating
Alone, alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone1Embed
