Never Named Lyrics
I had a dog, he was a mix
He loved me like a God
But I was just a kid
The kind mother likes
Now I'm big like the sky
But I'm downsized inside

I'll lay this all to rest
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm getting all depressed
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy

I got my father's sense and my big brother's pants
And I look like a man and I feel like an ant
Just a speck on the ground
Growing like a weed
A fleck of a seed
I'll put my hand in flames

I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I feel like I'm born again
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'll put this all to rest
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm getting all depressed
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy

And I'll keep hanging from your hair
And I'll keep playing in the sand
Just as long as I canEmbed
