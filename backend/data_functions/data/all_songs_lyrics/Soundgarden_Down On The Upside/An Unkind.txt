An Unkind Lyrics
We see the vipers of distance
Crawl into our lives everyday
Breeding our Edens of hatred
Pathetically stupid and unkind

We couldn't look a saint in the eyes
We couldn't look a saint in the eyes

On the storm
It's time to go
On the storm
It's time to go

Marching in lines of contradiction
Forgetting the history we make
Loving our hangmen as the penultimate joke

We lack the Moses
To look a saint in the eyes

On the storm
It's time to go
On the storm
It's time to go

On the storm
It's time to go
On the storm
It's time to goEmbed
