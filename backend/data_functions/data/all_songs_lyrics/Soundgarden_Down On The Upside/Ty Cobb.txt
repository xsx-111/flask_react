Ty Cobb Lyrics
I'm sitting in a magic hat with smoke and mirrors
And tire-rubber fires watch me disappear, yeah
What made it slow you down sucking on a ball and chain
Another motherfucker goes down the drain, yeah

Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll

Sick in the head, sick in the mouth
Can't hear a word you say, not a bit, and I don't give a shit, yeah
Got the glass, got the steel, I got everything
All I need is your head on a stake, yeah

Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Just add it up (to the hot rod death toll)
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Just add it up (to the hot rod death toll)
Hard-headed fuck you all
(Hard-headed)
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Hard-headed fuck you all
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll
(To the hot rod death toll, hot rod death toll
Hot rod death toll, hot rod death toll)
Go!
Go!Embed
