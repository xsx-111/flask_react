Never the Machine Forever Lyrics
I can't live when it lives
It won't live if I die
Machine has no heart to give
Heart it takes could be mine

Come on, come down
Come out from where you hide

Follows me down the river
Shadows me through the sky
A sideways glance in the mirror
Stalemate machine in tie

Come on, come down
Come out from where you hide
Get up, get off
Get on with your life

Forever means all is not seen
Never means forever brings everything

I fashion will and desire
Always I and I survive
Mercurial mind the fire
Ferrivorous directions and drive

Come on, come down
Come out from where you hide
Get up, get off
Get on with your life

Forever means all is not seen
Never means forever brings everything

Get up, get off
Get on with your life

Presently, I see myself clearer
Why time, I visualize?
I spy device in the mirror
Checkmate, watch machine dieEmbed
