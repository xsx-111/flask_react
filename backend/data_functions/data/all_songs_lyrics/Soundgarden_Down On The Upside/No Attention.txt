No Attention Lyrics
I've got war on my mind, blood on my hands
And love on my head
So open your hands, open your mouth
Let it be said
You know I've got it made in my mind
Don't waste my time, it's not going to change
So say what you want, spit it out loud
Into my face

Now I'll pay no attention
No attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention

They're going to tell you where to walk
When to smile and just what to say
They say, have your own fall, make your own mind
But don't make no waves
And if you got a handful of change
Don't throw it away, it's gonna come
So say what you want, suck all my lies
Suck on my brain
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention

I'll pay no attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention


No attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
No attention
I'll pay no attention
No attention
I'll pay no attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
Yeah!

They're going to tell you where to walk
When to smile and just what to say
They say, have your own fall, make your own mind
But don't make no waves
And if you got a handful of change
Don't throw it away, it's gonna come
So say what you want, suck all my lies
Suck on my brain

I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attentionEmbed
