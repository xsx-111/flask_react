Switch Opens Lyrics
Hey, you slaves, go hang your owners
Draw your names among their ashes
Lay your children on their thrones
Gather round and fall right down

Here at sundown
Nothing is when everything is all right
Switch opens
Opening around and lets the garden rise

Switch is on, switch is on
Switch is on, switch is on
Switch is on, switch is on
Switch is on, switch is on

Hey you patients, where's your surgeons?
Left you with your insides open
Left your heart out on the table
Gather round and fall right down

Feel the wind now
Stumbling and wander in the moonshine
Switch opens
Opening around and lets the garden rise
Switch is on, switch is on
Switch is on, switch is on
Switch is on, switch is on
Switch is on, switch is on

Switch is on
Switch is on1Embed
