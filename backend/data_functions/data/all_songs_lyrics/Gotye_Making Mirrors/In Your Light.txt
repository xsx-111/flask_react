In Your Light Lyrics

Get up in the morning
I can't keep it in
I'm falling all over myself
And I could jump out of my skin
Wanna break the door down
Just to greet the day
'Cause there ain't nothing that's more certain
To keep my blues away

And I say
(La la, hey hey)
And I say
(La la, hey hey)

And it can settle the sadness
And the voices in my head
When I'm in the glow of the warmth you throw
I can put all that to bed

(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
In your light, just when I'm in your light
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
And I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
And when you're smiling on me (smiling on me)
That is all I need
To put behind me all my worry (all my worries)
And life's complexities
It may be only a moment
But the world just falls away
And I forget myself
And everything else
That depressed me yesterday

And I can sing
(La la, hey hey)
Yeah I sing
(La la, hey hey)

When I'm in your light
All of this is clear
If only I could always be just as I am right here (in your light)
When I'm in your light, just when I'm in your light (in your light)
And I won't get by if you take that light away (in your light)

(La la, hey hey)
(La la, hey hey)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(La la, hey hey)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(La la, hey hey)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(La la, hey hey)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(La la, hey hey)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
When I'm in your light
Nothing brings me down (in your light)
For you I could always feel (in your light)
Like I do right now (in your light)

When I'm in your light (in your light)
Just when I'm in your light (in your light)
And I won't get by (in your light)
When you take that light away (light away)

When I'm in your light
All of this is clear
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
If only I could always be just as I am right here
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
In your light, just when I'm in your light
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
And I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
No I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
No I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(eeh)
