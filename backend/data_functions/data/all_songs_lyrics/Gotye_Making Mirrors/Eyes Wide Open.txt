Eyes Wide Open Lyrics
With our eyes wide open, we—
With our eyes wide open, we—

So this is the end of the story
Everything we had, everything we did
Is buried in dust, and this dust is all that's left of us
And only a few ever worried
While the signs were clear, they had no idea
You just get use to livin' in fear
Or give up, when you can't even picture your future
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—
(Walk the plank, with our eyes wide open, we—)
Yeah, we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—
(Walk the plank, with our eyes wide open, we—)

And some people offered up answers
We made out we like we heard they were only words
They didn't add up, to a change in the way we were living
And the saddest thing, is all of it could've been avoided
But it was like to stop consuming, to stop being human
And why'd I make a change if you won't
We're all in the same, boat, stayin' afloat for the moment
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—
(Walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—)
Yeah, we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—
(We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—)
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—

With our eyes wide open, , we—
Walk the plank, we walk the plank
With our eyes wide open, we—
Walk the plank, we walk the plank, we walk the plank
With our eyes wide open, we—
Walk the plank, we walk the plank
With our eyes wide open
And that is the end of the story9Embed
