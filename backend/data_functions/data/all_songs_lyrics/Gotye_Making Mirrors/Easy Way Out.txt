Easy Way Out Lyrics
Seventeen seconds then I'm over it
Ready for the disconnect
Putting on a brave face, trying not to listen
To the voices in the back of my head

But it's alright now (It's a distant memory, baby)
Alright now (You know you should just let it go)
Some feelings have a habit of persisting
Even though you wouldn't let it show

Wearing me out (All this)
Hanging around (It just starts)
Getting me down (Till I'm just)
Looking for an easy way out

Brain-dead from boredom, I'm led to distraction
Scratching the surface of life
Nothing really happens, but it's easy to keep busy
When you tell yourself you're traveling right

But it's alright now (Was it really worth it, baby?)
Alright now (Is it just a waste of time?)
Keep on second guessing
Use my memory like a weapon on everything I try
Wearing me out (All this)
Hanging around (It just starts)
Getting me down (Till I'm just)
Looking for an easy way out
Wearing me out (All this)
Hanging around (It just starts)
Getting me down (Till I'm just)
Looking for an easy way out5Embed
