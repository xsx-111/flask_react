State of the Art Lyrics

When the Cotillion arrived, we threw out the television
Model D-575 has custom flute presets
And Harmony-Plus in addition
Now for an arm and a leg
We get three half-dozen beats to choose from
So now we can pretend
That there's an orchestra in the lounge room
I put the Genie Bass on
So my left hand can play the choir, with 16ft Diapason
And Lowrey's patented Orchestral Symphonizer
Banjo's great on repeat
The kids want to play but they'll have to be patient
The wife can't help tapping her feet
It's a genuine home entertainment revelation

State, state, state, state of the art (State of the art)
(Hold the phone, it's so)
State, state, state, state of the art (Listen to the difference)
State, state, state, state of the art (By use of a computer)
(Oh my God, it's so)
State, state, state, state of the art

Now we don't want to go out
When we could spend the night at home with the Cotillion
Invite the neighbors around
Start the Bossanova beat and limbo from the living to the kitchen
Enjoy the state of the art
The Magic Swing Piano really is astounding
Now we can't tell them apart
But these amazing simulations end up sounding even better than the real thing

State, state, state, state of the art (State of the art)
(Hold the phone, it's so)
State, state, state, state of the art (Computer controlled tone color)
State, state, state, state of the art
(The marriage of music to computers is quite natural)
(Oh my God, it's so)
State, state, state, state of the art (It is time to hear the results)

Hold the phone, it's so
Oh my God, it's so
Incidentally, on the track you just heard, there were no keyboard performances
Just the occasional pressing of buttons1Embed
