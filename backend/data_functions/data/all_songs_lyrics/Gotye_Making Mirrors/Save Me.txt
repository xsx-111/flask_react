Save Me Lyrics
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo (mhama)
Ehyea, eyo (mhama)
Ehyea, eyo (mhama)
Ehyea, eyo (mhama)

In the mornings
I was anxious
It's better just to stay in bed
Didn't want to fail myself again
Running through all the options
And the endings
Were rolling out in front of me
But I couldn't choose a thread to begin

(Ooh)
And I could not love
Cause I could not love myself
Never good enough, no
That was all I'd tell myself (ooh)
And I was not well  (ooh)
But I could not help myself  (ooh)
I was giving up on living  (ooh)
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo

In the morning
You were leaving
Travelling south again
And you said you were not unprepared
And all the dead ends
And disappointments
Were fading from your memory
Ready for that lonely life to end

(ooh)
And you gave me love (ooh)
When I could not love myself (ooh)
And you made me turn (ooh)
From the way I saw myself (ooh)
And you're patient, love (ooh)
And you help me help myself (ooh)
And you save me (ooh)
And you save me (ooh)
Yeah you save me
Eeh, ooh (mhama)
Eeh, ooh (mhama)
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo
Ehyea, eyo6Embed
