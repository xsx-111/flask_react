Ships Passing Through the Night Lyrics
I'm just a lonesome ship passing through the night
I'm just a lonesome bird flying on a midnight flight

All I got for you is me
So darling can't you see
We'll make love all through the night
Make love all through the night
Lay your troubles down on the chair
You've got to shake those blues right out your hair
