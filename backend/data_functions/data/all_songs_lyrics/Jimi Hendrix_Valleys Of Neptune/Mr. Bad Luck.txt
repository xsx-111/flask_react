Mr. Bad Luck LyricsLook over yonder, here come the blues
The thirteenth of any time, just like a fool
A double-breasted green and red polka-dot coat
Playing the violin, hittin' wrong notes
Wow! Look over yonder, he's coming my way
When he's around, I never have a happy day
He gives me bad luck by rubbin' his wing
See that? I just broke a guitar string
D'aww...
Ow!

Wow! Look over yonder, he's smiling at my babe
Now she says she's gonna leave me here today
I don't need bad luck like uh, him hanging around
He's knockin' on my door, now my house is burnin' down
Crackle, crackle
Pop, pop
Wow! Look over yonder, this is the end
He's just now saying he wants to be my friend
When he's around, I can't do nothing right
He's got me wearing shades in the middle of the night
Look over yonder, yeah
Look over yonder, baby
Got to get away, get away from here
Ow! Look over yonder, yeah
Look over yonder, baby
Got to, got to look over yonder
Yeah
Look over yonder
Where's my shotgun so I can blow this fool away?
Get away, brother!
Ow, look over yonder, baby!
Yeah!
Look over yonder!
Look over yonder, baby
Look over yonder!
Yeah, yeahEmbed
