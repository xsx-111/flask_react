Cocktail and a Song Lyrics
Daddy passed me his bottle of tequila
Said, "Time's running out
We're gonna have to pretend it's a margarita
It's the order of things, it's the way it goes
Don't you look at me, girl, like I'm already gone"

The day is close, it won't be long
Couple of cocktails and a song
And don't you let me see you cry
Don't you go grieving
Not before I'm gone

He had his lighter on a leash
And menthols in his shirt pocket
Said, "I'm going up with the smoke
There's no doin' anything to stop it
So take a deep breath
Quit with the countdown
You've always been your daddy's girl
Nothing's gonna change that now"

The day is close, it won't be long
Couple of cocktails and a song
And don't you let me see you cry
Don't you go grieving
Not before I'm gone
And then he stared down at his shoes
Through the pink begonia's blue
Said, "Daddy, all I want is your silver belt buckle
And maybe your black Stetson hat"
And both of us laughed about that

The day is close, no it won't be long
Couple of cocktails and a song
Don't you let me see you cry
Don't you go grieving
Not before I dieEmbed
