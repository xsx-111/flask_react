If She Ever Leaves Me Lyrics
I see you watch her from across the room
Dancing her home in your mind
Well, it takes more than whiskey to make that flower bloom
By the third drink you'll find out she's mine

I've loved her in secret
I've loved her out loud
The sky hasn't always been blue
It might last forever
Or it might not work out
If she ever leaves me, it won't be for you

She loves Wild Horses and Tumbling Dice
She don't have a single tattoo
She'll drink all the liquor and leave you the ice
That's too much cologne, she likes perfume

I've loved her in secret
I've loved her out loud
The sky hasn't always been blue
And it might last forever
Or it might not work out
If she ever leaves me, it won't be for you
If she ever leaves, it's gonna be for a woman with more time
Who's not afraid to let her dreams come true
If she ever gives her careful heart to somebody new
Well, it won't be for a cowboy like you

Hey, I've loved her in secret
I've loved her out loud
The sky hasn't always been blue
It might last forever
Or it might not work out
If she ever leaves me, it won't be for you
If she ever leaves me, it won't be for you1Embed
