My Only Child Lyrics
I know you wish
You had a brother who had blue eyes just like you
I know you wish
You had a sister you could tell your secrets to
Maybe we'll miss
Having four sets of china on the table
But I guarantee you this
You mean more to me than branches to a maple

Pink painted walls
Your face in my locket
Your daddy and me
Your tiny back pocket
Mama's first love
Last of my kind
You'll always be my only child

Well I can't let go
Of watercolor memories that you made me
And I'm holding on
To the innocence of tea parties and daydreams

Pink painted walls
Your face in my locket
Your daddy and me
Your tiny back pocket
Mama's first love
Last of my kind
You'll always be my only child

Someday your wish
Will come true when your first baby's born
And you'll cherish every kiss
And wonder how you could love something more

Pink painted walls
Your face in my locket
Your daddy and me
Your tiny back pocket
Mama's first love
The last of my kind
You'll always be my only child (Child)
My only child (My only child)
My only child (Child)
My only child (My only child)

I know you wish
You had a brother who had blue eyes just like youEmbed
