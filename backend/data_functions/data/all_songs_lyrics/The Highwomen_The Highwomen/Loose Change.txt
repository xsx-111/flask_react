Loose Change Lyrics
I remember the night when I caught your eye
Nothing but good fortune
Nothing but good times
Seems lately even love has lost its shine
Used to make me feel like a million bucks
And now you got me feeling like

Loose change
I ain't worth a thing to you
Loose change
You don't see my value
I'm gonna be somebody's lucky penny someday
Instead of rollin' 'round in your pocket like loose change

Right now I could be finally settin' sail
See the Seven Wonders
Wonderin' why the hell
I keep on setting myself up to fail
Stuck inside this game with you
Flippin' heads or tails

Loose change
I ain't worth a thing to you
Loose change
You don't see my value
I'm gonna be somebody's lucky penny someday
Instead of rollin' 'round in your pocket like loose change
Well, love is not supposed to be
Played like Monopoly
Be careful where you're tossing me
'Cause I'll be rolling away

Like loose change
I ain't worth a thing to you
Loose change
You don't see my value
I'm gonna be somebody's lucky penny someday
Instead of rollin' 'round in your pocket like loose change

I'm fallin' out of your pocket like loose changeEmbed
