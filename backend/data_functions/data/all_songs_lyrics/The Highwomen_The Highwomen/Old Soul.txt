Old Soul Lyrics
Weight of the world on these small shoulders
Beyond my years is where I like to stand
My crazy chapter was already over
Before it began

I listen to vinyl for the scratches
I find myself in other people's shoes
I fix my mama's problems like a habit
And Daddy's too

Oh to be a wild child for a day
All the promises I've ever kept
I'd line 'em up to break
Oh to be a dancer on the edge
I'd rip the filter from my mouth
And all my cigarettes
But I know I won't
I guess I was born an old soul
Old soul, ooh

I'll be the first to toast and throw confetti
And break the champagne bottle with a sword
And when the party's over, I'll be ready
To sweep the floor
I don't fall in love every other minute
I don't mind it taking its sweet time
I just know I'll know it when I see a
Soul like mine

Oh to be a wild child for a day
All the promises I've ever kept
I'd line 'em up to break
Oh to be a dancer on the edge
I'd rip the filter from my mouth
And all my cigarettes
But I know I won't
I guess I was born an old soul
Old soul, ooh
Old soul

It's fine to dream
But I don't need

Oh to be a wild child for a day
The promises I've ever kept
I'd line 'em up to break
Oh to be a dancer on the edge
I'd rip the filter from my mouth
And all my cigarettes
But I know I won't
But thank God I was born an old soul
Old soul
Old soul
Old soul, ooh
Hey, old soul
Old soul
Hey
Hey, hey, yeah
Ah, old soul, old soul, hey
Mmm
Ooh
HeyEmbed
