Redesigning Women Lyrics
Full-time living on a half-time schedule
Always trying to make everybody feel special
Learning when to brake and when to hit the pedal
Working hard to look good 'til we die
A critical reason there's a population
Raising eyebrows and a new generation
Rosie the Riveter with renovations
And always gets better with wine

Redesigning women
Running the world while we're cleaning up the kitchen
Making bank, shaking hands, driving 80
Trying to get home just to feed the baby
Skipping the bread for the butter
Changing our minds like we change our hair color
Yeah, ever since the beginning
We've been redesigning women

Pulling up the floors and changing out the curtains
Some of us are saints and some of us are surgeons
Made in God's image, just a better version
And breaking every Jell-O mold
And when we love someone, we take 'em to heaven
And if the shoe fits, we're gonna buy 11
How we get it done, we like to keep 'em guessing
But secretly, we all know
Redesigning women
Running the world while we're cleaning up the kitchen
Making bank, shaking hands, driving 80
Trying to get home just to feed the baby
Skipping the bread for the butter
Changing our minds like we change our hair color
Yeah, ever since the beginning
We've been redesigning women

How do we do it? How do we do it?
Make it up as we go along
How do we do it? How do we do it?
Halfway right and halfway wrong

Redesigning women
Running the world while we're cleaning up the kitchen
Making bank, shaking hands, driving 80
Trying to get home just to feed the baby
Skipping the bread for the butter
Changing our minds like we change our hair color
Yeah, ever since the beginning
We've been redesigning women1Embed
