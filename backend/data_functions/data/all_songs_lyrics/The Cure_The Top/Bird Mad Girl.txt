Bird Mad Girl Lyrics
This girl has got a smile
That can make me cry
This girl just burns with love
She's burning, burning deep outside

Night time, night time sets my house on fire
Oh, I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life to feel I feel desire

Oh, I should feel
Like a polar bear
Like a polar bear
It's impossible

She flies outside this cage
Singing girl-mad words
I keep her dark thoughts deep inside
As black as stone, as mad as birds
Burn wild, wild, wild, and never turn away
Oh, sends me all her love, she sends me everything
She sends me everywhere
Oh, I could be
A polar bear
Oh, I could be
A polar bear
It's impossible

Try to talk, ow!
The sky goes red, uh-huh
I forget, so fill my head
With some of this, some of that
Some of every word she says

Oh, night time, night time sets my house on fire
I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life to feel I feel desire

Oh, I should be
A polar bear
Oh, I should be
A polar bear
But it's impossible3Embed
