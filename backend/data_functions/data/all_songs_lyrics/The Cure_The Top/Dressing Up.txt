Dressing Up Lyrics
Going under slowly, oh
It never seems too late
Going under so slow, oh
So slow

Dressing up to kiss
I'm dressing up to touch all this
(Dressing up, dressing up)
Oh, I'm dressing up to dance all week
I'm... (dressing up, dressing up)
I'm dressing up to sleep
Dressing up to kiss
Ooh, dressing up to be all this
I could eat your face
I could eat all of you
(Dressing up, dressing up)
(Dressing up, dressing up)
Oh, this night will never let me go (Dressing up, dressing up)
(Dressing up, dressing up)
This night will never, never let me...

Going under slowly
Ah, never seems too late
Going under slow, oh
You'll pick me up againEmbed
