Bananafishbones LyricsCurl into a ball like you have more fun
Oh, that would make it faster
Why do you do it, do you do it, do you act like you?
Why do you do it, do you act like you?
Don't fight, go red and blue and black and white
And sell this, sell this
Or leave it senseless like a suck on a gun
Put a piece of metal in your head, you said
And make you dead, make you hippa, hippa, hippa, hippa
A palace of stones of your bananafish bones
I'll buy you a hundred years old
To celebrate our difference, theorise and talk yourself
Until you're tired and old
Disappear everywhere and watch me
Pull my lips apart
Exploit, inspire, encourage, be responsible for this
Ha ha
I don't think, I don't think
I make use of all this time
Oh, kill me, kiss me once, and then we'll throw it away
And then we'll throw it away
Curl into a ball like you have more fun
Oh, that would make it faster
Why do you do it, do you do it, do you act like you?
Why do you do it, do you act like you?
Don't fight, go red and blue and black and white
And sell this, sell this
Or leave it senseless like a suck on a gun
Put a piece of metal in your head, you said
And make you dead, make you hippa, hippa, hippa, hippa
I don't think, I don't think
I make use of all this time
Oh, kill me, kiss me once, and then we'll throw it away
And then we'll throw it away
And tell me about the games you play
Oh, turn off the lights
And tell me about the games you playEmbed
