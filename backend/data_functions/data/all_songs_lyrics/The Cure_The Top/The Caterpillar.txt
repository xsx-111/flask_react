The Caterpillar Lyrics
Flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker
Here you are
Cata-cata-cata-cata-cata-cata-cata-cata
Caterpillar girl
Flowing in and filling up my hopeless heart
Oh, never, never go

Oh, I'll dust my lemon lies
With powder, pink and sweet
The day I stop is the day you change
And fly away from me

You flicker and you're beautiful
You glow inside my head
You hold me hypnotized, I'm mesmerized
Your flames, the flames that kiss me dead

I'll dust my lemon lies
With powder, pink and sweet
The day I stop's the day you change
And fly away from me
Flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker
Here you are
Cata-cata-cata-cata-cata-cata-cata-cata
Caterpillar girl
Flowing in and filling up my hopeless heart
Oh, never, never go

Oh, I'll dust my lemon lies
With powder, pink and sweet
The day I stop's the day you change
And fly away, away from me
