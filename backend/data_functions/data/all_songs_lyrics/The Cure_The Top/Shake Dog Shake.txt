Shake Dog Shake Lyrics
Ha ha ha

Wake up in the dark
The after-taste of anger in the back of my mouth
Spit it on the wall
And cough some more and scrape my skin with razor blades
And make up in the new blood
And try to look so good
Follow me
Make up in the new blood
And follow me to where the real fun is
Ha ho ho
As stale and selfish as a sick dog
That's spurning sex like an animal of god
I'll tear your red hair by the roots and hold you blazing
Hold you cherished in the dead electric light
Your face, I'll never see you this way again
I captured it so perfectly as if I knew you'd disappear away

Oh, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake dog, shake
Oh yeah, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake dog, shake
You hit me again
You howl and hit me again
The same sharp pain
Wakes me in the dark
And cuts me from my throat to my pounding heart
My heart, my shaking heart

Oh, shake, shake
Oh, shake dog, shake
Shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake dog, shake

But we slept all night in the virgin's bed
And dreamed of death and breathed like sick dogs
We slept all night in the virgin's bed
And breathed like death and dreamed of sick dogs

Oh, shake, shake
Oh, shake, shake
Shake, shake
Shake dog, shake
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake dog shake
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake dog, shake
Wake up in the new blood
Make up in the new blood
Shake up in the new blood
And follow me to where the real fun is
Shake dog, shake
Shake dog, shake
Shake dog...2Embed
