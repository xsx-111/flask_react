The Empty World LyricsAs stiff as toys and tall as men
And swaying like the wind torn trees
She talked about the empty world
With eyes like poison birds
She talked about the armies
That marched inside her head
How they made her dreams go bad
But oh, how happy she was, how proud she was
To be fighting in the war
In the empty world
Stiff as toys and tall as men
Swaying like the wind torn trees
She talked about the empty world
With eyes like poison birds1Embed
