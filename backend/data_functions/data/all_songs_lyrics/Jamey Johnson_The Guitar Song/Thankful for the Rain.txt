Thankful for the Rain Lyrics
You say, "Hello", like a long lost friend
And play me like an old violin
In a day or two, you're gone again
And I wonder why I keep playin'

I sit and watch the clouds each day
Wonderin' when they'll turn to gray
And you come and you go, like a storm across the coast
And expect me to be thankful for the rain

Well, I guess I should be thankful for
All the nights of straight downpours
I'm soakin' up every drop I get
'Cause who knows how long I'll have to wait
'Til you come blowin' back my way
I'm learnin' to be thankful for the rain

I know when the mornin' comes
The truth will rise up like the sun
'Cause I'm cleanin' up the damage done
That's everything I prayed for
You come and you go, like a storm across the coast
And expect me to be thankful for the rainEmbed
