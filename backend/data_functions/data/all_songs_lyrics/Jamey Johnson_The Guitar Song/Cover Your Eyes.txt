Cover Your Eyes Lyrics
I'm sorry, a phone call is the best I could do at this time
You're busy
But this on again, off again, is startin' to mess with my mind
So baby

Cover your eyes
It can't hurt forever
Soon I won't ever
Cross your mind
Cover your eyes
If you don't see me goin'
There's no way of knowin'
When it's time to cry

Cover your eyes

Darlin', if you wake up tomorrow, and everything seems
Different
If I only exist as a name on your telephone screen
Well, hey, listen

Cover your eyes
It can't hurt forever
Soon I won't ever
Cross your mind
Cover your eyes
If you don't see me goin'
There's no way of knowin'
When it's time to cry
Cover your eyes

Cover your eyes
It can't hurt forever
Soon I won't ever
Cross your mind
Cover your eyes
If you don't see me goin'
There's no way of knowin'
When it's time to cry

Cover your eyesEmbed
