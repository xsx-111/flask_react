Even The Skies Are Blue Lyrics
These are sad times
World gone mad times
Men doin' bad times
Lord, what is this world comin' to?

Between religions and wars
Drugs and divorce
Hell, it seems like the whole world is fightin'
The sun might be shinin'

But even the skies are blue

These are hard days
Heavy old heart days
Dead string guitar days
And the devil is pickin' his tune

When our daddy's quit stayin'
And our momma's quit prayin'
Even the children quit tryin'
Well God must be cryin'
'Cause even the skies are blue

If we all know a way
To make a better day
Why isn't anyone tryin'?
The sun might be shinin'

But even the skies are blueEmbed
