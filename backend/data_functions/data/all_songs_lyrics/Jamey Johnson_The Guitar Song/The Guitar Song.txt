The Guitar Song Lyrics
I'm just an old guitar in a pawn shop down on the corner
And I'm waitin' for somebody to come by and play me now and then
My strings are kinda rusty, and I'm a little dusty
Oh, but you'd be too if you'd been where I've been

I did some shows with Haggard back in 1967
And I'm just dyin' for somebody to come by and play me back home
Yeah, I'm just an old guitar in a pawn shop on the corner
Hey, come on by and listen to my song
Wow, Haggard, huh?
I ain't never met him

But I've seen at least a million of those tiny smoky bar rooms
And I've helped to heal some heartaches and I've helped to sell some beer
And the last one that held me just couldn't wait to sell me
And for 20 dollars left me hangin' here

But I dream about the spotlight and the roarin' of the people
And I wonder if I'm ever gonna hear 'em sing along
I'm just a guitar in the pawn shop on the corner
Hey, come on by and listen to my song
Yeah, you probably won't believe this
But I played in El Paso one time with Marty
Marty Robbins?
Yeah, and I played in Saginaw with Lefty
Oh
One night Johnny got to a show
And he didn't have his guitar with him
He picked me up out of the case and
Played me right there on that stage
Oh, that's cool
Yes, he did

Oh, I've got a lot of memories and a song or two left in me
And some day somebody will pick me up and play me back home
I'm just a guitar in the pawn shop on the corner
Hey, come on by and listen to my song

Won't you come on by and listen to my song?Embed
