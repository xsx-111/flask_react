Heartache Lyrics
I was born by a fire in a cold dark cave
In the age of the dinosaur
When the caveman caught his cave-woman lovin'
On the missin' link livin' next door
There was cryin' and screamin'
And war drums beating and a wave of violence
None of them folk survived but me
And I've been hangin' 'round ever since

'Cause I'm a heartache, never see me comin'
I'll always take you by surprise
I'm a heartache, hungry and huntin'
For someone I can eat alive
By the time you know I'm on you
Buddy, it's too late

I'm a heartache

I watched you takin' off tonight
And I knew where you were headed to
I saw that sweet young thing you met
At that dirty old motel room
Yeah, I'm gnawin' on your pretty little wife
Waitin' up for you at home
And you don't even know it but I'm just savin' you for later
When I can get you all alone
I'm a heartache, never see me comin'
I'll always take you by surprise
I'm a heartache, hungry and huntin'
For someone I can eat alive
By the time you know I'm on you
Buddy, it's too late

I'm a heartache

From Anthony and Cleopatra, Samson and Delilah
To Jackie and JFK
Elvis and Priscilla, Charles and Diana
I say I've had some pretty good days
You may not believe it but you and me, son
Are about to have some real fun
'Cause I'm comin', oh, I'm comin'

I'm a heartache, never see me comin'
I'll always take you by surprise
I'm a heartache, hungry and huntin'
Someone I can eat alive
By the time you know I'm on you
Buddy, it's too late
I'm a heartache

I'm a heartache
I'm a heartacheEmbed
