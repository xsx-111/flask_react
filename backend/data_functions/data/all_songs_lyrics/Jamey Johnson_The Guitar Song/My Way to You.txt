My Way to You Lyrics
Setting fires, and dark desires
The nights that I just can't recall
I've woke up flyin' with the angels
But no one to catch me when I fall

Goin' down the wrong road and
Livin' by the wrong code and
Chasin' after dreams that don't come true
Lookin' for the right signs and
Ridin' on the white lines, just
Tryin' to find my way to you

Well, there's been high times, and there's been hard times
And there's been times I couldn't tell
If I'm livin' a good life or livin' a bad life
'Cause I'm always livin' fast as hell

I'm goin' down the wrong road
Livin' by the wrong code and
Chasin' after dreams that don't come true
Lookin' for the right signs and
Ridin' on the white lines, just
Tryin' to find my way to you
From an Alabama porch
To a dirty bar room floor
Burnin' bridges down I'd never even crossed
From when I didn't have a care
To when I didn't have a prayer
I never once thought I was lost, somehow I knew
I would find my way to you

I'm goin' down the wrong road
Livin' by the wrong code
Chasin' after dreams that don't come true
Lookin' for the right signs
Ridin' on the white lines, just
Tryin' to find my way to you

Tryin' to find my way to youEmbed
