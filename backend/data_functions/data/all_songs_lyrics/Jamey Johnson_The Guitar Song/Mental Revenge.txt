Mental Revenge Lyrics
Well, I hope that the friend, you've thrown yourself with
Gets drunk and loses his job
And that the road you're travellin' on
Gets dusty, rocky and hard
I couldn't make you love me
You only made me blue
So all in all if the curtain should fall
I hope that it falls on you

I'll have sweet, sweet, sweet
Mental revenge
I'll have sweet, sweet, sweet
Mental revenge

Well, I hope that the train, from Caribou Maine
Runs over your sweet love affair
And that you walk the floor from door to door
And pull out that peroxide hair
You never was my woman
'Cause you were never true
So all in all if the curtain should fall
I hope that it falls on you
I'll have sweet, sweet, sweet
Mental revenge
I'll have sweet, sweet, sweet
Mental revengeEmbed
