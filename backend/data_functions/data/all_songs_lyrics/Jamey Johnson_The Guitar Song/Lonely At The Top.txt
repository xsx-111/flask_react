Lonely At The Top Lyrics
I was pourin' out my troubles
To a stranger in a bar
'Bout the problems and the pressures
On a country music star
Half braggin', half complainin'
'Bout the money and the fame
And just how lonely lot can be
When you've made yourself a name

I said, "Would you like a drink?"
He said, "Thanks, I'll have a double
I worked up a powerful thirst
Just listenin' to all your troubles"
"And while he makes that drink
I'll smoke one if you got it
It might be lonely at the top
But it's a bitch at the bottom"

I left a hundred on the table
And didn't wait around for change
With my load a little lighter
And my thinkin' rearranged
That stranger made me realize
How thankful I should be
And if I forget, I hope those words
He said come back to me
I said, "Would you like a drink?"
He said, "Thanks, I'll have a double
I've worked up a powerful thirst
Just listenin' to all your troubles"
"And while he makes that drink
I'll smoke one if you got it
It might be lonely at the top
But it's a bitch at the bottom"

"It might be lonely at the top
But it's a bitch at the bottom""Embed
