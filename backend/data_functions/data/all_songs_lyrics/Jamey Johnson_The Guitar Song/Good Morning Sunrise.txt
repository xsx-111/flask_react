Good Morning Sunrise Lyrics
Good morning sunrise
How long has it been?
Well, it looks like
I drank myself sober again

Ever since she left me
You've been so hard to face
Good mornin' sunrise
Guess I'll call it a day

Last time I saw you
You let me down
I told her by mornin'
She and I would work things out

Well you took that sky
Just like she was yours to take
Well, good morning sunrise
Guess I'll call it a day

You always held her
In a better light than I
I brought her heartache
On your beauty, made her cry
They say whiskey before noon
Is such a shame
That's why the night
Has taken your place

Unlike you, her memory
Never fades away
Good mornin' sunrise
Guess I'll call it a day

Good mornin' sunrise
Guess I'll call it a dayEmbed
