I Remember You Lyrics
I always thought that one of the most important conversations you could ever have in your life, is the first time you talked to God. What would you say?

I remember You
In the pages of a book
A lady read me once
In Sunday school

I remember You
I studied every word
And I hid it in my heart
Just like You told me to

And a stone was rolled away
And everybody prayed
The day the angels sang
I remember You

And while you're standin' there on those tremblin' knees, what do you hope God says back to you?

I remember you
I was there when you were born
I held your momma's hand
And your daddy's too
Aw, I remember you
I recall the very day
You turned against the Devil
And you cried out my name

And then a stone was rolled away
And everybody prayed
The day the angels sang
I remember You

I remember YouEmbed
