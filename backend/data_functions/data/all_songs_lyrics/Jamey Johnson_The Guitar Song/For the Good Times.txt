For the Good Times Lyrics
Don't look so sad, I know it's over, but life goes on
And this old world, will keep on turnin'
Let's just be glad, we had some time, to spend together
There's no need, to watch the bridges that we're burnin'

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body, close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops, blowin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me, one more time

For the good times, I'll get along, and you'll find another
And I'll be here, if you should find, you ever need me
Don't say a word, about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness, when you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body, close to mine
Hear the whispers of the raindrops, blowin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me, one more time, for the good times
[Outro
For the good timesEmbed
