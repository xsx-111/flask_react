Playing the Part Lyrics
Takin' a dip on the Sunset Strip in the mornin'
Ain't nothin' like the smell of tofu and high dollar wine
Except maybe all of them cars lockin' down the I-5
I find it amazin', these rats I've been chasin', are helpin' me remember a time

When the only L.A. I knew
Was lower Alabama
Back when me and Hannah
Was wishin' on a southern star
Now it's so complicated, I really hate it
Why'd I ever wanna go so far?
Takin' depression pills in the Hollywood Hills
Actin' like I'm playin' the part

All this grippin' an' grinnin', an' bluesin' an' winnin' an' runnin'
And promises break like an egg on the hot asphalt
What the hell was I thinkin', drinkin' like I'd never get caught?
These high dollar women and the fame and the fortune, ain't worth the ticket I bought

When the only LA I knew
Was lower Alabama
Back when me and Hannah
Was wishin' on a southern star
Now it's so complicated, I really hate it
Why'd I ever wanna go so far?
Takin' depression pills in the Hollywood Hills
Actin' like I'm playin' the part
Takin' depression pills in the Hollywood Hills
Actin' like I'm playin' the partEmbed
