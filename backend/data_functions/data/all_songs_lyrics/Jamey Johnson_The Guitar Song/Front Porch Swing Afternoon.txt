Front Porch Swing Afternoon Lyrics
Sittin' here countin' the cars goin' by
In an hour must've been one or two
The sheets are flappin' on Momma's clothesline
It's an old front porch swing afternoon

I can hear music from somewhere inside
The faint sound of a Hank Williams tune
I just caught the smell of a blackberry pie
On this old front porch swing afternoon

And, ooh-ooh, feel that breeze blowin'
That magnolia showin' her blooms
On this old front porch swing
Afternoon

That old dog is layin' under Grandpa's old chair
He ain't lookin' for nothin' to do
An' that tractor is stirrin' up dust over there
On this old front porch swing afternoon

I can see Grandma now in her old checkered dress
Beatin' a rug with her broom
The clouds are a-churnin' comin' in from the west
On this old front porch swing afternoon
And, ooh-ooh, feel that breeze blowin'
The sun will be goin' down soon
On an old front porch swing
Afternoon

It's an old front porch swing
AfternoonEmbed
