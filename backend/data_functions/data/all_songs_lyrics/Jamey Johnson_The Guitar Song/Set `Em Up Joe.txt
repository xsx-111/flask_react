Set `Em Up Joe Lyrics
They got a vintage Victrola 1951
Full of my favorite records that I grew up on
They got ol' Hank and Lefty and there's B24
Set 'em up, Joe and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up, Joe and play 'Walking The Floor'

I'm gonna spend the night like every night before
Playin' ET and I'm gonna play 'em some more
I gotta have a shot of them old troubadours
Yeah, set 'em up, Joe and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up, Joe and play 'Walking The Floor'

All my neon neighbors, they like what I play
'Cause they've heard it every night since you walked away
Every day they replace old B24
'Cause every night I run the needle through 'Walking The Floor'
Every night I run the needle through 'Walking The Floor'

I'm gonna spend the night like every night before
Playin' ET and I'm gonna play 'em some more
I gotta have a shot of them old troubadours
Yeah, set 'em up, Joe and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up, Joe and play 'Walking The Floor'
I said, set 'em up, Joe and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up, Joe and play 'Walking The Floor'Embed
