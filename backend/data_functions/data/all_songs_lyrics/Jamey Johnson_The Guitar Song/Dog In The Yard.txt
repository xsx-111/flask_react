Dog In The Yard Lyrics
You don't have to keep me on no chain
I come a-runnin' when I hear you call my name
I must not be too hard to train
Took you, no time at all

Oh, an' you don't really like none of my friends
You never really know just where I've been
When I slip up on your porch at 4 A.M
Like an old stray dog

So you scratch me, you pet me
And fight me and even let me win, now and then
You scold me, you tease me
Then you hold me and tell me I'm your friend

Well, makin' love to you, babe, ain't so hard
You treat me like a dog in the yard

Sometimes you kick at me when I'm down
And it drives you crazy when I just lay around
No matter what you do, I think I've found
A perfect home
'Cause you scratch me, you pet me
And you fight me and even let me win, now and then
'Cause you scold me, you tease me
Then you hold me and tell me I'm your friend

Well, makin' love to you, babe, ain't so hard
You treat me like a dog in the yard

Aw, you treat me like a dog in the yardEmbed
