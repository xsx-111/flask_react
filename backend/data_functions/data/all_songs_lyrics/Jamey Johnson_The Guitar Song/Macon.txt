Macon Lyrics
I'm headed back to Macon
Middle of the Georgia pines
Gotta keep these big wheels rollin'
To that sweet little thing of mine

I gotta get back to Macon
(Love all night)
I gotta get back to Macon
(Love all night)
I gotta get back to Macon
Love all night
Look out, Macon
Here I come

Well, my baby says she ain't crazy
'Bout stayin' home all alone
And the faster I go the more I know
About waitin' too damn long

Gotta get back to Macon
(Love all night)
Yeah, I gotta get back to Macon
(Love all night)
I gotta get back to Macon
Love all night
Look out, Macon
Here I come
Well, I may run down to Houston
Saturday afternoon
Well, my baby said, "Boy, you had your fun
You better get your butt back soon"

You gotta get back to Macon
Love all night
You gotta get back to Macon
Love all night
I gotta get back to Macon
Love all night
Look out, Macon
Here I come

(Love all night)
Yeah, here I come
(Love all night)
Look out, Macon
Here I come
(Love all night)
(Love all night)
(Love all night)Embed
