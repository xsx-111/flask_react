By the Seat of Your Pants Lyrics
He said crickets catch more bream
But worms'll get more bass
And it really ain't them brand new shoes
That make you run so fast
He said you'd better finish
Buddy, even if it's last
Life has a way of teachin' us these things

And he said this hurts me
More than it hurts you
But it's the only
Way to find the truth
You see life ain't no rehearsal, boy
You only get one chance
And you'll learn that by the seat of your pants

He said sometimes huntin'
Ain't all about the kill
Sometimes that woman of your dreams
Can be a little bit too real
Sometimes you gotta go to work
No matter how you feel
Life has a way of teachin' us these things
And he said this hurts me
More than it hurts you
But it's the only
Way to find some truth
You see life ain't no rehearsal, boy
You only get one chance
And you'll learn that by the seat of your pants

He said this hurts me
More than it hurts you
But it's the only
Way to find some truth
You see life ain't no rehearsal, boy
You only get one chance
And you'll learn that by the seat of your pants

You're gonna learn that by the seat of your pantsEmbed
