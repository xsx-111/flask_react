Heaven Bound Lyrics
The first time I held your hand
I knew I, was a lucky man
Felt like God forgave me
Of all my wrongs

I keep tellin' myself
That I'm heaven bound

Sometimes it sure gets cold
In the fall on music Row
But it's worth it
If it gets me by somehow

I keep tellin' myself
That I'm heaven bound

'Cause it seems like we don't ever
Have near enough time together, anymore
And all these lonely nights without you
Will go away when I can hold you, in my arms
I keep tellin' myself
That I'm heaven bound
I keep tellin' myself
That I'm heaven bound

I keep tellin' myselfEmbed
