The Man Who Would Be King Lyrics
As he travels on the beast of burden
Moving up along the mountainside
As he gazes looking down the valley
No regrets but his pride
As he journeys across mountain passes
Insignificance sweeps over him
His reflection of the beauty 'round him
Feeling empty inside
He is running from his wildest thoughts
He is running from his everything
He is looking now to find something
Hoping he could be saved

He's searching for the answer now
It's something that he's managed to avoid up to now
Real conviction that he craves
He needs to find the answer sooner than later
Pushed himself to the limits
He had to strive for all the harder things in life
But what the cost to give in now?
His life, his time are the only things that he has

Life is not a rehearsal
All he has is the one chance to get it right
Leaving really is the only way to know
Maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done
But now the pain of lying too early in the grave
Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace


He tries to make his peace with God
All is forgivable but it's left a little late
Trying something that he's not
Is it possible to change such a lot?
He's taken someone's life away
There's not a day goes by he regrets what he's done
He should have found another way
But the good book says: "An eye for an eye"
In reflecting on decisions that were made
On the judgements that will haunt him till his grave
No one has the right to take another life
But in his mind he had no choice, so be it

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace
Far, far away, the man who would be king
Far, far away, the man who would be king
So far away, the man who would be king
So far away, the man who would be king
Far, far away, the man who would be king2Embed
