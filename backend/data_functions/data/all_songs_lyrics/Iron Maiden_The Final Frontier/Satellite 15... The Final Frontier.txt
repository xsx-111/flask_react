Satellite 15... The Final Frontier LyricsPart 1: Satellite 15


I try to call the Earth's command
Desperation in my voice
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice
The loneliness is hard to bear
I try to calm my fear
Just hoping any second now
Some contact filters through

Desperate calls
Signal back from satellite
As my life
Flashes right in front of me
Try again
Must get through
Hear me now
For I've very little time

Not much time
Hear my call
Please get through
I am here
Part 2: The Final Frontier

I'm stranded in space
I'm lost without trace
I haven't a chance of getting away
Too close to the sun
I surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes

I think of my life
Reliving my past
There's nothing but wait till my time comes
I've had a good life
I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time afresh

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier
If I could survive
To live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Done more in my life
Than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier


There isn't much time
Must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes
If only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find
For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier

The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier1Embed
