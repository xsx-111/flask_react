El Dorado Lyrics
Got to tell you a story
On a cold winter's night
You'll be sailing for glory
Before you know what is right
So come over here now
I got a vision for you
It's my personal snake oil
It's just something I do

I'm the jester with no tears
And I'm playing on your fears
I'm a trickster smiling underneath
This mask of love and death
The eternal lie I've told
About the pyramids of gold
I've got you hooked at every turn
Your money's left to burn
(Hahahaha...)

You'll be wanting a contract, ha!
You'll be waiting awhile
I'd like to give you my contact
But that isn't my style
Well you only get one chance
And it's too good to miss
If I didn't lie to you
Then I wouldn't exist
Greed, lust and envy pride
It's the same old same old ride
The smoke and mirrors visions
That you see are just like me
I'm a clever banker's face
With just a letter out of place
I know someone just like you
Knows someone just like me

El Dorado, come and play
El Dorado, step this way
Take a ticket for the ride
El Dorado streets of gold
See my ship is oversold
You got one last chance to try


So gone is the glory
And gone is the gold
Well if you knew the story
How come it has to be told
Well you can say I'm a devil
And I wouldn't say no
But out here on the dark side
Hey! on with the show
So then my tale is told
Big and bad and twice as bold
This ship of fools is sinking
As the cracks begin to grow
There is no easy way
For an honest man today
Which is something you should think of
As my lifeboat sails away
 (x2)
El Dorado, come and play
El Dorado, step this way
Take a ticket for the ride
El Dorado streets of gold
See my ship is oversold
You got one last chance to try3Embed
