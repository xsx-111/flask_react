Deliver Us from the Elements LyricsWe can plant a seed and watch it grow
Food enough to fill a table
Running water down an overflow
Eat as much as we are able
But would the fruit turn ripe
If the rains had never been?
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elements
We, at Your mercy and Your reverence
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elements
We've no defense, we are impotent
You can travel far to distant lands
Some, so hot, no man could bear
You can conquer peaks with winds of sand
Where Mother Nature didn't care
Would not our world turn cold
If the sun refused to shine?
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elements
We, at Your mercy and Your reverence
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elements
We've no defense, we are impotent
And when the world grows old
And we know more than our brains can hold
Nature will be law
Well, we're as helpless, now, as we've ever been before
Would not our world turn cold
If the sun refused to shine?
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elements
We, at Your mercy and Your reverence
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elements
We've no defense, we are impotent
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elements
We, at Your mercy and Your reverence
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elements
We've no defense, we are impotent
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elements
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elements
Oh Lord, deliver us from the elementsEmbed
