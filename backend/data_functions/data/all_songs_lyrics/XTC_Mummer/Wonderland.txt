Wonderland Lyrics
Can't you see, love and affection
When it's put in your direction?
Wrapped in your mysterious wo-honderland
No fast car can make you grow up
Gentlemen, you think you've sown up
Locked in your wonderful wo-honderland

No dark horse like me
Can cramp all of your style
Too plain and simple
I am for your file

One day you will break out of your spell
And some day you will want me for your own
And I'll say, "Welcome to reality"

All this talk of late-night parties
Flirting with the lower gentry
Lost in your magical wonderland
Out of depth, out of class
Phase of your life will come to pass
Caught in this tragical wo-honderland
All of the riches
That shine will turn sour
Each moment you slip
You will bring near the hour

And one day you will break out of your spell
And some day you will want me for your own
And I'll say, "Welcome to reality"


Wrapped in your mysterious wonderland
Caught in your superficial
Nonexistent fairy-story wonderland


Caught in your tragical wonderland
Wonderland
Mysterious wonderland
