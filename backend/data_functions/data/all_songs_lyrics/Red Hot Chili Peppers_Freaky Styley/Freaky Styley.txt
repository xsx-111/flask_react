Freaky Styley Lyrics

Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face

Say it out loud
I'm freaky styley and I'm proud
Say it out loud
I'm freaky styley and I'm proud

Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
I'm freaky styley and I'm proudEmbed
