Jungle Man Lyrics
Deep inside the soul hole of a-Mother Earth
Father Time came with a supersonic, supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle givin' bush, baby, bush-baby birth
The baby was a boy, but I think what stunned her
Is that this bare-breasted baby was a baby boy, boy, boy, boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone came thelonious thunder, yeah
Fill the sky with hellfire from way down, down, down under

I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I get all the bush I can

Erupting from the ground in Hollywood, he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete, his funk bone, bone, bone, bone to stone
Like a full-blown volcano, I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein, atomic lava blood flows, and flows
His soul-shocking sounds, they make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man, it's time to
Take, take, take, take the throne
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I get all the bush I…



I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I get all the bush I…

I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle manEmbed
