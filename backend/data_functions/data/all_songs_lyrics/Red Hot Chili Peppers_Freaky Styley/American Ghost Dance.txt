American Ghost Dance Lyrics
Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard a peaceable word
From the white trash who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep, they offer no relief
God save the queen, I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep, it's called the talking leaf
And you better believe that he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds a sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of a wounded knee creek

American ghost dance
American ghost dance
American ghost dance
American ghost dance

A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life, but he's in chains
I'm alive he cried, I can feel the flame
Burning red inside, I am an Indian brave
There is a memory, uh huh, that lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid on all you touched
But the burning flame, it turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide and that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane, I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died when it should have been saved
American ghost dance
American ghost dance
American ghost dance
American ghost dance

Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard a peaceable word
From the white trash who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep, they offer no relief
God save the queen, I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep, it's called the talking leaf
And you better believe that he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds a sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of a wounded knee creek
