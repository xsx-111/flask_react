Battle Ship Lyrics
Three miles off the coast of Beirut
New Jersey's guns get ready to shoot
Take a walk down the firing room
Fire one it's shakedown cruise, yeah

Blow job park
Blow job park

See the sailor boys dressed in blue
Cheer the chance to make the news
Send the shell down the spiral groove
Bombs away it's a shakedown cruise, yeah

Blow job park
Blow job park

Three miles off the coast of Beirut
New Jersey's guns get ready to shoot
Take a walk down the firing room
Fire one it's shakedown cruise, yeah
Blow job park
Blow job parkEmbed
