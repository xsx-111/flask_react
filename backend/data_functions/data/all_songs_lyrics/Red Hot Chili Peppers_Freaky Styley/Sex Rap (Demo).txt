Sex Rap (Demo) Lyrics
Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're going to get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumping that driving bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine
Sucking on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out
Make her moan, make her groan and make her shout
Push it all in and pull it all out
Pump that labia 'till it pouts

Open your legs to the sensual sound
Let the booty bustin' beat pound your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hump the ground
As you're droppin' to your knees and I come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down

Our lustful notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady loving a viable stud
Causing what is known as a juicy wet pud
Getting it getting it getting' it good
In my head, as a jellified hum
I take to rubbing her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb I strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like oozing hot cum

Well I like to make her cum
To the rhythm of the drums
Make her cum, make her cum, cumEmbed
