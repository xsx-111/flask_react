Hollywood (Africa) Lyrics
Well all right, take me back, hold my hand
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back, I want to go back, oh
Take me back with my funky ass band
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back, let's go

I want to go as fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brotherland
Now children, take me on back
Take me on back, take me on back
Take me on back (East L.A.)
Hollywood

I want to get up and go with my funky ass jams
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back, take me back
I want to go back

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Hollywood
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Take me on back, take me on back
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Take me on back, take me on back
Where the woman is the woman
And the man is the man

Hollywood
Hollywood
Hollywood
Hollywood

I want to go fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brotherland
Now children


Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, LordEmbed
