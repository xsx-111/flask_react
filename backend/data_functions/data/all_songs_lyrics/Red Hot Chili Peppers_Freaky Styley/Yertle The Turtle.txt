Yertle The Turtle Lyrics
Look at that turtle go, bro

On a far away island of Salamasond
Yertle the turtle was king of the pond
A nice little pond, it was clean it was neat
The water was warm, there was plenty to eat
Until one day the king of them all
Decided the kingdom he ruled was too small
I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough and that's the trouble with me

With this stone for a throne, I am too low down
I cannot look down upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king gave a command
He ordered all the turtles onto one another's back
He piled them high into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle, the things I now rule
I'm king of a cow, I'm king of a mule
Look at that turtle go, bro

Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burping' little turtle
Looked up and said "I beg
Your pardon king Yertle"
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty
"Silence!" the king of the turtles barked back
To the bad burping little turtle named Mack
I'm Yertle the turtle, oh marvelous me
For I am ruler of all that I see
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Wow!
Look at that turtle go, bro
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtleEmbed
