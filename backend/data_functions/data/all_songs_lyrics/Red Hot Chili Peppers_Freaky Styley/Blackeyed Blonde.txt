Blackeyed Blonde Lyrics
Pumpin' the blood through the heart of New Orleans
She's the mystic heat of the Bourbon Street dream
She's just made out of flesh and bones
But let me tell you little boy, you better leave her alone

Leroy Brown thought he was bad too
'Till she left him floatin' in the old bayou
She's the kind of girl, she's built like a bomb
She's the blackeyed, blackeyed
Blackeyed blonde, get down

Uh-huh, blackeyed pea
She black
She blonde

That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox
Heaten queen of sleeze she's hot to box
But let me tell you little boy, she'll clean your clock

A slick and sly spy, stuck in the muck of the moat
Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat
Double-o-dooms day for Mr. James Bond
She's the blackeyed, blackeyed
Blackeyed blonde, get down!
Uh-huh, blackeyed pea
She black
She blonde
