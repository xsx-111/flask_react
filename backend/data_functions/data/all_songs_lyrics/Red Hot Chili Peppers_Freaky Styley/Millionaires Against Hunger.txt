Millionaires Against Hunger Lyrics
We're millionaires
Against hunger

I'm a millionaire
And I got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All the other ones' bills starting to percolate
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay
Well I'm a millionaire too, but not like you
As far as I'm concerned, I got a job to do
I've got to pave the way, I've got to save the day
I've got to make it better, I've got to say
You and I, we're millionaires, but we're a million miles away from the saint who stares
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week
Just because they can't get enough to eat
While we the rich dine on all these feasts, and everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme
But it just isn't something you've got to realize, there's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes
When the world cries, we just can't hide, we've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives

We're millionaires
Against hunger
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Pave the way, take the dare

I'm a millionaire
And I got something to say
I got three or four yachts on the Chesapeake Bay
All those people starvin' everyday
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay
Well I'm a millionaire too
All I know that is true is that I've got more cash than I can use
I want anything that I can have, but I don't need nothin' and I never have
Each damn day my heart's set far, but I'll be okay, cuz I won't starve
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night, you know it gives to share
So listen up, you millionaires, every woman, every man, help all you can
All races unite, and I will now concern to the type of problem that helps us learn
We're millionaires
Against hunger

Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Pave the way, take the dareEmbed
