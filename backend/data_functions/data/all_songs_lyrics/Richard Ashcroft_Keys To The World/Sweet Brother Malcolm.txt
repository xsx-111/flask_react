Sweet Brother Malcolm LyricsSweet brother Malcolm, he's under house arrest
It's the talk of the town, who'd of thought it of him?
Sweet cousin Mary, no blood in her veins
She had so much, now nothing remains
When it all comes crashing down
And the press move in to town
Bring all floral words wrapped in sellophane
Sweet cousin Tony, where'd it all go wrong?
He hit the wall, singing his favourite song
When it all comes crashing down
And the press move in to town
Bring all floral words wrapped in sellophane
Watch them move out as fast as they came
Leave the broken-hearted with their pain
Sweet brother Malcolm, he's under house arrest
It's the talk of the town, who'd of thought it of him?
Sweet angel Mary, no blood in her veins
Where's this life? madness remains
Madness will reign
Madness will reign1Embed
