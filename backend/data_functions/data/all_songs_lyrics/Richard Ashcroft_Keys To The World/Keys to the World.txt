Keys to the World LyricsInstitutions, you run through them oh from the age of five
And no one loves you, cares if you lived or you died
Here we go again in your room your idle pleasures
The sinking sands fell through the net, no one to catch them
Here we go again in your room your idle pleasures
The sinking sands perhaps I could make it better
I've got the keys the world yea, oh mixed up world
I've got the keys the world yea, oh suicidal world
I've got the keys the world yea, oh mixed up world
I've got the keys the world yea, whatcha gonna do
When we get there? When we get there?
Confrontations, you expect them oh from someone you never loved
And there's no point in fighting, the truth is they'll never return
Here we go again in your room your idle pleasures
The sinking sands fell through the net, no one to catch them
Here we go again in your room your idle pleasures
The sinking sands perhaps I could make it better
I've got the keys the world yea, oh mixed up world
I've got the keys the world yea, whatcha gonna do when we get there?
I've got the keys the world yea, oh suicidal world
I've got the keys the world yea, whatcha gonna do when we get there?
Climb any mountain, and I swim in the sea (when we get there)
And I practice my logic 'cause of what will be will be
And I climb any mountain, and I swim in the sea
And I practice my logic, cause of what will be will be (when we get there)
Put the knife back, put the stabbing arm in, take your time, let me begin
It's like a slow train moving out of your head, understand, before life is death
But tick-tock, the clock, and my time
In a vicious thing, your mind unwind me, Lord untie me
Come on, any place you want
Let's keep it moving on, don't want you here on this spot
Let me speak my mind, oh baby let me
Untie you, untie you, hmmmmm, now fly-a, fire, fire, fireEmbed
