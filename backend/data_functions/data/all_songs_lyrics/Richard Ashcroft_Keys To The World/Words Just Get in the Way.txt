Words Just Get in the Way LyricsWhen you've given all you've got
And you're feeling overcome
When you're backs against the wall
There's no one left to call, call me
When your head is so full
And you feel misunderstood
And the fear is coming fast
You think your time has passed
You say why me, why me?
If you want it
You know I've got it
Words they just get in the way
If you want it
Oh yeah I've got it
Words they just get in the way
Words they just get in the way
In the way
When you're feeling like you've lost
When all you're hope is gone
And the bridge above the river
Is only the beginning of your fall
If you want it
Oh yeah I've got it
Words they just get in the way
If you want it
Oh yeah I've got it
Words they just get in the way
Words they just get in the way
Sing it too me now
All my life in the way
ABC all the way (I think)
Since I was a child
Words they drive me wildEmbed
