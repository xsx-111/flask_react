World Keeps Turning LyricsIt's been a long time since I've been round here
I'm driving so fast that the trees disappear around me
Everything I know or have known before
It's here in my mind, I think you know the score
The world keeps turning, everybody's learning
Keep your head up, the race, it's the human despair
All my blocks every night I try to figure out what's wrong or right
It's a psychedelic dream, I'll bring you love, anything
But the tears will flow just like thew blood on the streets, yeah
It's been too long since we sat down here and talked
It's been too long since you know we separated
It's been so long, I wish that I could build a bridge
It's been so long how can I see through it?
The world keeps turning, everybody's learning
Keep your head up, the race, I'm learning to spin
Time to land on my friends, everything's right in my life again
Oh pain, don't you take it away and give me days that were black and grey
And all the corners of my mind turn and twine into another guy
Oh here a hypocrite, yea I did, turn my words and combine
Twisting your head making you think I'm singing right to you
It's ok if you want I'll give you the time and money to run
You could be president if you get that far
Then give me some helpEmbed
