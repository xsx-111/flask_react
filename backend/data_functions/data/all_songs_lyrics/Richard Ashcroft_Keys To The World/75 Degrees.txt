75 Degrees Lyrics75 degrees, nothing is bugging me
Keep whisper tree, my baby and me
75 degrees, the killer in me
Rushing through my veins, taking away my pain
Over me, under me, within me
Without me, under me, over me
I bite the hand that feed, I feed the hand that bite
And everyone is strange, not everyone's to blame
I can't wait for hell to break the spell
It is here in my feet to my toes above and down below
You know I'm afraid, you know I'm scared
And so are you, and so is he, and so is she, what's the point in trying hide
Give me a reason to breathe, give me a reason to feel
I often wondered when it all went right
I often wondered when it all went right
I often wondered when it all went right
I often wondered when it all went rightEmbed
