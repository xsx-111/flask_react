Why Do Lovers? LyricsCome now baby
Stay in bed, don't think that it's lazy
Get ourselves another god
Don't let them tell us there isn't one (isn't one)
Stay, sweet honey
Life's so fast, ya know it ain't funny
Get ourselves another god
Don't let them tell us there isn't one (isn't one)
Like we are just skin
Can you behold
Know beauty within
Know beauty inside your body
You don't love any body
Why do lovers
Choose others
We circle, entwine one-another
In that mask that we wear with each other
Oh my god how I looked in that mirror
I looked in a hollow picture
It was something I could frame
That's right, sweet-heart
Life's tough now, life can be hard
Don't blame me for these pressures in life
Don't blame me for this sacrifice (sacrifice)
Ok, sweet-heart
Take your time, I know lovers they part
Time slows when you're in love
And time moves so fast when it's gettin' on (gettin' on)
Cos we are just skin
Can you behold
I know beauty within
Know beauty inside my body
I don't love any body
Why do lovers
Choose others
To mirror their pain, yeah
Slow down stranger
You know that you're in danger
These demons I've got they are major, yeah
Ready for you to lay it onnnnnnnnnEmbed
