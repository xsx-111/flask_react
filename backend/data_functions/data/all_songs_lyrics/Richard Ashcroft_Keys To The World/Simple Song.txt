Simple Song LyricsI opened up my eyes, swear I saw the light
Don't you know the truth, it's so very hard to find
Tell me, does it feel good? Tell me does it feel right?
I'm singing (singing), I'm singing (singing)
I'm singing, singing a simple song
Some things die, to stay alive
The tears we cry, we'll drink them sometime
Yeah, I'm happy to feel this way, don't know another way
I'm happy to feel alright
Oh, it's the only thing that gets me through the night
I'm not scared 'cause I know I will survive
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
Mercy has its place, I know I've made mistakes
Please open those arms, fill me with your grace
Tell me, does it feel good? Tell me does it feel right?
I'm singing (singing), I'm singing (singing)
I'm singing, singing a simple song
Some things die, to stay alive
The tears we cry, we'll drink them sometime
Yeah, I'm happy to feel this way, don't know another way
I'm happy to feel alright
Oh, it's the only thing that gets me through the night
I'm not scared 'cause I know I will survive
That's right, that's right, that's right
Yeah, I'm happy to feel this way
You know, I don't know another way (yes I know I can survive)
Yeah, I'm happy to feel this way (yes I know I can survive)
'Cause I don't know another way ('cause I know I can survive)
Oh my my my my my my, c'mon (yes I know I can survive)
Oh oh my my (Yeah I know I can survive)
(Yes I know I will survive) Uh uh uh uh uh ah ah oh
Uh uh uh uh uh ah ah oh, uh uh uh uh uh ah ah ohEmbed
