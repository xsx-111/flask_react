Music Is Power Lyrics
Music is power, let it flow through your mind
You're just like a flower, yeah, in the deep sunshine
Are you invited to the party of life?
Now you've been sighted, oh, do you live 'til you die?

These are wild, wild, wild days we live in
Yes, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
These are strange, strange vain days of living
Yeah, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
Don't give up, oh no, all right
Let the melody flow all night, all night

'Cause music is power, it's easily sold
Rocking like a cradle, yeah, it won't let you go
If the melody's timeless it won't let you down
Feel the air moving, submit to the sound

In these wild, wild, wild days we live in
Yes, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
These are strange, strange vain days of living
I know sometimes we all wanna give in
Don't give up, oh no, all right
Let the melody flow all night, all night
After all we go through, the endless crime
Bad days good fortune, yeah, are things you find
'Cause music is the mantra unwinding your head
Music is the question to things unsaid

These are wild, wild, wild days we live in
Yes, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
These are strange, strange vain days of living
Yeah, I know sometimes that you just don't fit in
Don't give in, don't give up, don't pack it up, stop cracking up
Let the song carry you on and keep you strong

Don't wanna control ya, ooh-ooh
'Cause music is the power, power, submit to the sound
Feel the air moving, moving, submit to the sound
Feel the air moving, moving, submit to the sound
Feel the air moving, moving, submit to the soundEmbed
