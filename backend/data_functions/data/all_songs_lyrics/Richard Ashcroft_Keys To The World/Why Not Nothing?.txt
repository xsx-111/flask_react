Why Not Nothing? LyricsI ain't got time for your politics
Or your masqueraded Machiavellian tricks
Goodbye, you know I ain't got the time
You don't deny it it's abuse of the cross
Let's get some of God squad in the dock
Where they belong, ah where's ya song?
It's a high road on your own you gotta learn the way you do
Take my advice don't let 'em treat you like a fool
Hey brain, I wanna look you in the eye
That's when we started singing
Why not, why not nothing? Why not, why not nothing?
Why not, why not nothing? Why not, why not nothing?
Denial is survival though your every day
Who the fuck are you when you take that mask away?
Friend I don't know, ahh, where do we go?
I do not know what's real or blue-screen
Hollywood's directing World War III
What's going on? Ahh, pass me a gun
It's a high road on your own you gotta learn the way you do
Take my advice don't let 'em treat you like a fool
Hey brain, I wanna look you in the eye
That's when we started singing
Why not, why not nothing? Why not, why not nothing?
Why not, why not nothing? Why not, why not nothing?
Why not, why not nothing? Why not, why not nothing?
Why not, why not nothing? Why not, why not nothing?
'Cause it's a high road on your own you gotta learn the way you do
Take my advice don't let 'em treat you like a fool
Hey brain, I wanna look you in the eye
That's when we started singing
Why not, why not nothing? Why not, why not nothing?
Why not, why not nothing? Why not, why not nothing?
Why not, why not nothing? Why not, why not nothing?
Why not, why not nothing? Why not, why not nothing?Embed
