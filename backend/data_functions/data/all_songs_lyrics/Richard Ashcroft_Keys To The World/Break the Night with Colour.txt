Break the Night with Colour LyricsFools they think I do not know
The road I'm taking
If you meet me on the way
Hesitating
That is just because I know which way I will choose
The corridors of discontent
That I've been traveling
On the lonely search for truth
The world's so frightning
Nothing's going right today
'Cos nothing ever does
Oooh, I don't wanna know your secrets
Oooh, they lie heavy on my head
Oooh, let's break the night with colour
Time for me to move ahead
Monday morning coming down
Like understanding
Mama thinks you are the clown
Looking so frightning
Nothing's going right today
'Cos nothing ever does
Oooh, I don't wanna know your secrets
Oooh, they lie heavy on my head
Oooh, let's break the night with colour
Time for me to move ahead
Time for me to break my cover
Time for me to move ahead
Been givin' up
You will come again
Oooh, I don't wanna know your secrets
Oooh, they lie heavy on my head
Oooh, let's break the night with colour
Time for me to move ahead
Time for us to move aheadEmbed
