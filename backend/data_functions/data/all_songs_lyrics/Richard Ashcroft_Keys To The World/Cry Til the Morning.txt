Cry Til the Morning LyricsFirst that I ever saw you
Knew nothing would ever be the same
Sweet love in the process
There were things that I needed to explain
Yeah You didn't play with my feelings
Like the others with their games
You said its time to do some bleeding
Time to cry the past away
Chorus
Cry til the morning
Cry til the morning
We just cried til the morning
Yeah I cried like never before
The first place I never quite asked her
Those pictures faded on the wall
Those family memebers
Sometimes they just gotta call
Sweet love in the process
Solid chewed and left combined
Have you got an address
Somepleace new that we can Find
Chorus
Cry, Cry til the morning
Cry, Cry til the morning
Cry, Cry til the morning
Cry like never before
Cry, Cry til the morning
Cry, Cry til the morning
Cry, Cry til the morning
Cry, Cry til the morning
Cry, Cry til the morning
C'mon
Cry, Cry til the morning
Cry, Cry til the morning, morning
Cry, Cry til the morning
Cry like never beforeEmbed
