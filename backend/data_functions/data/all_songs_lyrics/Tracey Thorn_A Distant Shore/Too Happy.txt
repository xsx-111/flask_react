Too Happy Lyrics
Just what has happened now I don't know
So happy five minutes ago
Laughing and talking of things that we planned
Then a wrong word and you dropped my hand

Sometimes I don't think and say things I don't mean
Expect you to read all the spaces between
Careless words I know you so soon regret
Cry 'cause I can't bear you to think I'm upset

Then I joke and say now I'll go home
But you should know I'd never leave you here alone

Why must we go through these little scenes?
Each wondering what the other's silence means
I wouldn't break it by turning to shout
So soon forget what I was angry about

I never believed that you could be too happy
But I realize now that we can be
When we can't cope with this love that we've found
Seems we'll say anything to knock it down
Then I realize I love you more
And is that what we go through this for?Embed
