Seascape Lyrics
Shadows on a sea wall
Watching clouds turning grey
Linger on a seashore
Till the sun went away

Watching tides
Tides that take me away
To a distant shore
And I don't want to be saved

Breezy on a cliff top
Looking at the waves
You used to make me sad
But, but it's not the same today
Thought I knew the sea and all its secrets too
But it's different in November with youEmbed
