New Opened Eyes Lyrics
How you supposed to tell when it's true
And when you're only fooling yourself?
Saying over and over
That it's still enough
Finding only bitterness when once was love

What do you supposed to do
When the truth explodes and knocks you down?
Close your eyes and count to ten
When you wait once more
Reappears the perfect day that was once before

How can you carry on this way
When each time you're near you turn your head away?
Everything has now been said
And the fire is cold and dead
Leave behind the love you shed
New opened eyes must look aheadEmbed
