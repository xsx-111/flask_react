Plain Sailing Lyrics
Meetings arranged, they say, never work out
I say we've proved them wrong without a doubt
I can't remember now just what we said
I never could have guessed what lay ahead
As I ran towards you up the stairs
Did a voice in my ear cry, "Beware"?

Even now I'm surprised you recall
Such a short time it took me to fall
Pretending that my heart still lay elsewhere
When in truth I had long ceased to care
For what I thought I'd never replace
Till in my heart you left him no space

You say, you wonder what was it I saw?
I say "Oh, I don't recall anymore"
My first impressions have been left behind
Replaced now by feelings and more lost in kind
Sure that you know but you never can tell
When I think I understand you so well
Shakes me that you were a constant surprise
Or so you appear in my eyes
Tempting to think now it will all be plain sailing
Old enough now to know there's no such thingEmbed
