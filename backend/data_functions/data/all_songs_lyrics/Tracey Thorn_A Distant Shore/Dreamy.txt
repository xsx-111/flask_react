Dreamy Lyrics
Girl hides behind a slipping smile
Drifts away another mile
Oh won't you stay awhile?
Conversation fades away
Another place another day
Stolen her tonight
Cast her from your sight
Not a single sound she hears
But the ringing in her ears

The light in her eyes is dead
Was it something that you said?
Set off these thoughts inside her head
Tumbles down inside her mind
Half afraid of what to find
And you worry endlessly
And search so desperately
For anything to say
But she can't hear you anyway

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Then you think that she's unkind
To keep you from her mind
Now that you're in love
You should know what she's thinking of
When what it was she couldn't say
One more wave could sweep her away
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo dooEmbed
