Small Town Girl Lyrics
This is all too much for such a small town girl
Though I see more than you think
This world, very little did I like
And when I did it was not mine

I never have believed in pure coincidence
And your distinctions proved such a subtle difference
And subtlety was always lost on me, yeah

Evenings can go to your head
(Some things are better left unsaid)
Feelings can get left behind
So keep your love and I'll keep mine
Keep your love and I'll keep mine

Still trying to get over my small town ways
But still so much a part of me is my past disgrace
And you might say you don't care
But how can you when you weren't even there?

And this is all too much for such a small town girl
I can only stand still
But your world, and everything I see
Just brings confusion to me
Don't know where I am today
But I wish you wouldn't look that way
Go straight to my head
Some things are better left unsaid
Feelings can get left behind
So keep your, keep your love
Keep your love and I'll try to keep mineEmbed
