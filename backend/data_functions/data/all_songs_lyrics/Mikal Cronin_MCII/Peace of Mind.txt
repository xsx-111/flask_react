Peace of Mind LyricsSay you want me, say it loud
Take the smoke in, let it out
Where we’re going, what’s to find
Can I help you? Can I try?
And I want to say I’m on my way
But I can’t find that peace of mind
I want to be there for you baby
No, the blind can’t lead the blind
Say you want me, say it’s fine
Take the light in, make it shine
I don’t know me well enough
To cure you. Is this love?Embed
