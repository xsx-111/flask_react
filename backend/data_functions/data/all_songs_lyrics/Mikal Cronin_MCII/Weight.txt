Weight LyricsI’ve been starting over for a long time
I’m not ready for another day I fail at feeling new
The time is right, I’m only getting older
I’m not ready for the second wave, the weight of seeing through
No, be bolder, golden light for miles
Sing for love in colder portions of my mind
I’m not ready for the weight again
Tie a line and hold on for a long time
There’s an answer for another man, I’ve yet to find a way
Wasted years or waiting for a savior
I’m not made out for the simple path, I’ll take it day to day
No, be bolder, golden light for miles
Sing for love in colder portions of my mind
I’m not ready for the moment
I’m not ready for the tide to change
I’m not ready for the silence
I’m not ready for the fear and shame
I’m not ready for the weight again
Take me from myself
Holding on for something, I don’t know
I’ve been starting over for a long time
I’m not ready for the second wave, the weight of seeing through4Embed
