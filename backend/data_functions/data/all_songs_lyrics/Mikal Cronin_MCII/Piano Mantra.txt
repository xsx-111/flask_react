Piano Mantra LyricsA fine line is crossed, no way back over
A long time, I’m lost, I can’t see over
Can you hear me or is it in my mind?
I learn hard, I’m tired, I’m sick I’m broke up
You find out what’s gone just when it’s used up
Can you hear me or is it in my mind?
Now overdrawn, I’m coming back home
Sink my roots and I’ll be gold
The open arms are giving me hopeEmbed
