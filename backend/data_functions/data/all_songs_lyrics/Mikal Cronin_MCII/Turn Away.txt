Turn Away LyricsI look for a different structure, I hope for a bit more time
I know that a different place won’t put my troubles on a different mind
I work with a tired structure, set down on a hazy mind
I fight for a new direction hoping there’s one to find and
No I won’t, no I won’t turn this away the pain of this all
As it grows I know I won’t walk away from change of it all
And when all is said and all is done and all is said and all is done
I’m afraid of a distant future, I’m scared that I got no time
I live with a real fear the fear I got won’t go
I’m tired ‘cuz I ain’t been sleeping, I’m stuck in the things I hide
I know that I’m still living open up your eyes and say
No I won’t, no I won’t turn this away the pain of this all
As it grows I know I won’t walk away from change of it all
And when all is said and all is done and all is said and all is done
Am I afraid of my faults? I wouldn’t think so…Embed
