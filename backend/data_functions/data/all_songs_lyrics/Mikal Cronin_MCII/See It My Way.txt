See It My Way LyricsI see the fire, I see the fire behind your eyes glow
I hear the song I wanna sing along with you
But when I try I’m out of tune, I turn and walk away
But I’m dying to get along with you
Trying to show you through
I want you to see it my way
I fear the fight that I’m about to fight for you girl
Cause it’s a side, a sight of me I’ve yet to see
And when I’m down broke battered bruised, won’t turn and walk away
Cause I’m dying to get along with you
Trying to show you through
I want you to see it my way
And so I tried, I’m in a hole am I a different man?
Can’t see the light shining above me every day
No I’m alright, I’m coming home, and I will find a way
I’m still dying to get along with you
Trying to show you through
I want you to see it my way1Embed
