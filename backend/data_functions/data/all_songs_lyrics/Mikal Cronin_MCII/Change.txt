Change LyricsI can’t climb the mountain all alone
I’ve been at the bottom for a long time
I’ve been waiting for the sun to set, the moon to shine
The day to change to night so I can fall
I’ve been waiting for you
Good god just a little bit, just a little bit goes a long way
Just a little bit, just a little bit goes a long way
Faith is just a lover I don’t own
Love is just an answer I don’t know
Tell myself I’m better off alone
But I’ve been at the bottom for a long time
I’ve been asking you to hold my hand, to bend it back
And take me down to let me know you’re gone
And stop waiting for you
Good god just a little bit, just a little bit goes a long way
Just a little bit, just a little bit goes a long way
Faith is just a lover I don’t own
Love is just an answer I don’t know
I’ve been worried for you
Been hoping for a long long long long time
That faith change is something you can findEmbed
