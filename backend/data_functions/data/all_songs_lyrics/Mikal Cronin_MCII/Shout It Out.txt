Shout It Out Lyrics
I learned a little bit a long, long time ago
Just from a friend I used to know
About how love can end so slow
I won't admit it, but my time is running low
I'm getting closer to the door
It's pretty late, I need to go

Do I shout it out? Do I let it go?
Do I need to know what I'm waiting for?
Oh no, I want it now, do I need it know?
Shit goes on and on and on and on and on

I'm pretty good of making things out of the scene
And turning problems back to me
It's not the way I want to be
But I've been thinking about the time you came around
You took my head up off the ground
Now that's a place I want to be

Do I shout it out? Do I let it go?
Do I need to know what I'm waiting for?
Oh no, I want it now, do I need it know?
Shit goes on and on and on and on and onEmbed
