All I Can Keep is Now Lyrics
Here is the noise
And it's passing through me
Street so warm
And its call so loud
Here, darling
All of the voices all the time

Whenever I sleep
It’s a goddamn journey
Every then
I've seen is now
Here, darling
All of the moments all the time

Walk in the rain
The train is somewhere
Out there to bend
Your lover's time

Your buildings are like shadows
And your eyes are deep
Here, all I can keep is now
Let’s make sure
That we wake up early
For a whiff
Of alone somehow
Here, darling
All of the hours all the time

Walk in the rain
Go rinse your worry
Walk it to bend
Your lover's time

Your buildings are like shadows
And your eyes are deep
Here, all I can keep is now

And all for a quiet surrender
A nowhere still out there to know
But from life in the arms of lovers
Can I bring someone when I go?

I ran into a friend
And her eyes said something
About a joke
That went through somehow
Here, darling
All of the subtle all the time
There is the light
The light is in me
Wasn't this all
Some crazy dream

Your buildings are like shadows
And your eyes are deep
Here, all I can keep is nowEmbed
