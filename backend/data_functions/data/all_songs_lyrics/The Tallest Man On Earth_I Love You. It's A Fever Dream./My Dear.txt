My Dear Lyrics
My body's in the summer storm
And my mind is with the feeling after
Old memories I can't let go
I'm moving on but they run faster

My morning is empty and the streets are wide
I look for nothing and I feel all right
Stillness in the ways I try
And then you walk on by

My body says the water's cold
But my mind will have a way to cross it
And I know I held the time so dear
And the feeling it was here, I lost it

My morning is empty and the streets are wide
I look for nothing and I feel all right
Stillness in the ways I try
And then you walk on by

In a patch in the forest
Little bells hang from the tree
And I ring them so gently
What if you heard me now, my dear?
My body's with the birds in me
But my mind is with the times they're leaving
I want them but I let them go
There's a sparkle in the dust I breathe in

My morning is empty and the streets are wide
I look for nothing and I feel all right
Stillness in the ways I try
And then you walk on by

My morning is empty and the streets are wide
I look for nothing and I feel all right, oh
Stillness in the ways I try
As I lean into the morning light
It's like my body's in some other town
And then you walk on byEmbed
