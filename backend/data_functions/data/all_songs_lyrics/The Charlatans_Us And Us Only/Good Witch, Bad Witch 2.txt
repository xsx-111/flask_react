Good Witch, Bad Witch 2 LyricsI'm goin' where the good wind blows
I'm goin' where the good wind blows
I'm goin' where the good wind blows
I'm goin' where the good wind blows
Goin' where the good wind blows, blows, blows, blows
I'm on the bad, bad side of the road
I'm on the bad, bad side of the road
You know you're goin' where the good wind blows
I'm on the bad, bad side of the road
You know you're goin' where the good wind blows
I'm on the bad, bad side of the roadEmbed
