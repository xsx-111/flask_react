A House Is Not a Home LyricsThe simple cost of loving you is a better picture
There is not a sound coming from my voice
You want to listen to the kids
Banging on their halos soon to be divorced
And you're a poor young factory boy
Blowing on your trumpet with a home on the back of your horse
Oh, this is a separation
I can't believe it is the end
You know I don't want to talk about it
Go tell it to your friend
I live and I breathe
With feeling for anything I might have tried
At a point where I can touch her
Everyday I wonder what's going on in her heart
I couldn't eat, sleep,f ind my feet
I think I used a little too much force
Come see me, you can heal me
Turn your head back to the moon
You know you don't have to act so quiet
This is a house, this is not a home
I can't do this anymore, I know it's pointless
I could never be yours
Play to your better nature
We can talk about the old days
I can't help it if you think I am odd
Although our separation
It is too easy, I believe it's your loss
Oh, simple cost of needing you
Is a part into the cause
On the street I can feel a sequel
This is a divorce

 sound coming from my voice
You want to listen to the kids
Banging on their halos soon to be divorced
And you're a poor 
Everyday I wonder what's going on in her heart
Oh, simple cost of needing you
Is a part into the cause
On the street I can feel a sequel
This is a divorceEmbed
