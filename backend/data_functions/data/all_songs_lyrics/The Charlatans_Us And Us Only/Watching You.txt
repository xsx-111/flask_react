Watching You LyricsWatching you
Learning to have every faith
In all of the things that you do
Oh, how much I've lied
Tears have been cried
Loving you
Hoping to finally nail it
All I need is your word
Oh, lazy bones
Where are all our friends
Where are all our friends
Going down again
Watching you
Finally finding the feeling
I know there's too much to do
Oh, hiccups and pride
Tears I cried
A feelin' all of its own
Look at all our friends
Goin' down again
Goin' down again
I can hardly get no feelin' at all
Like a baby first starting to crawl
Watching you
I only want to see you smile
All I need is a satisfied mind
And it's a long road
Don't cry, put your head on my shoulder
Don't cry, put your head on my shoulder
Took a long time to re-cover
I took a long time and now I'm missing you
Took a long time and I found you
I took a long time and I'm missing you
Took a long time and I found you
I took a long time and I'm missing you
Took a long time and I found you
I took a long time and I 
Took a long time and I found youEmbed
