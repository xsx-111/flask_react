Forever LyricsForever you're my foundation
I know I can keep
Told I was good for nothing
Branded a cheat
Now I know why you listen
I can help you anytime
Love is all there is
I wonder what people do with our lives
Hey
Oh! I wonder what you people do with your lives
Oh! I wonder what you people do with your lives
Oh! I wonder what you people do with your lives
Once more this will be forever
I can't withhold secrets
I know I'm going where the sun always shines
I know, my son, we've made it
It can't escape my mind
I know my star, I know my star
Is a brighter star, brighter star
Forever be in my arms
Forever be in my arms
This could be a myth in the making
Under a spell
Down to ambition
I guess you could even call it a miracle
I see my true love coming
My little bundle of joy
I can help you realise
It's us and us only
I know I'm as good as my neighbour
A starter for ten
I can't promise you I'll always need you
I promise I'll always be there
Oh! I wonder what you people do with our lives
Oh! I wonder what you people do with our lives
Hey, oh, I wonder what these people do with their lives
When you find it you'll feel it
I'll give you all my love
Hold it, don't leave it, misuse it
As long as you believe enough
My mind is multiplying
I have so much to give
I wouldn't underestimate you for the way you want to live
