The Blind Stagger LyricsLord, it's been a long time
And people don't you find always leave their troubles at your door
I, I live on my own
I don't need a bitter soul beatin' on about my country anymore
Don't you think your daddy needs you home right away
Your daddy needs you home right away
Oh, it's about time, can't you for once be strong
I bleed a little too
You're invisible, is there something I can give to you
I see my light come shining
There is good on the horizon
Daylight sneaking through my window
I will give you a rainbow and a bucket full of gold
You've been bitten by eleven hungry kittens
Who will go the whole distance while the blind stagger
Oh, let the light shine, could you for once be strong
I bleed a little too
You're invisible, is there something I can give to you
I see my light come shining
There is good on the horizon
Daylight sneaking through my window
I will give you a rainbow and a bucket full of gold
You been bitten by eleven hungry kittens
Who will go the whole distance while the blind staggerEmbed
