Southampton Dock Lyrics
They disembarked in '45
And no-one spoke and no-one smiled
There were too many spaces in the line
Gathered at the cenotaph
All agreed with the hand on heart
To sheath the sacrificial Knifes
But now
She stands upon Southampton dock
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock clings
To her wet body in the rain
In quiet desperation knuckles
White upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again

And still the dark stain spreads between
Their shoulder blades
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made, but
In the bottom of our hearts we felt the final cut1Embed
