The Glow Lyrics
The blow came down from the hills
Followed by snow
Oh, the snowy blow

I could feel far off the glow
I made my way through September and the next month
Towards the glow
I moved slow down from the hills
I'm getting cold
Buried in snow

"Hey wake up, it's me, that glow
Wake up and listen close
Warm up and come down through the hills
Towards the warm red lamp window"

I started to glow, oh
Oooooh
And it felt just like
Being pulled out by the tide
I held onto your side
We swam till it got light
'Cause the blue was deep and wide
In sunlight our bodies glide
There was water in my eyes
We sank and we arrived
We found ourselves inside the light

The light
The Glow

On the cold dark ocean floor
I felt warmth from behind a door
I asked to come inside
And the glow replied1Embed
