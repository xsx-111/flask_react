The Gleam Lyrics
Quiet beach, soaked through and through
Feel on my waist your wet hand
Surprised we both survived
Later, our burning bodies both made a glow
And we rose as smoke and then as a puff of ash
We drifted out over the sea
Where it hurts too much to look
It hurts to try and see

At that point we could just step into the gleamEmbed
