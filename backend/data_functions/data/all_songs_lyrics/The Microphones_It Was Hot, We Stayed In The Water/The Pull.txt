The Pull Lyrics
My body stopped moving
And quickly got cold
I made my escape through exhaling lungs
And watched my body rot away

Nobody noticed my misty escape
And I ended up floating like water in the air
To a blowy oceanside above the pounding of waves
That's when you showed up on the foggiest day

From high above you
I saw your earthling body wrapped in wool
The glow surrounds you
And when you breathed in, I felt the pull
Aaaah....
Aaaah...
Aaaah...
Aaaah...2Embed
