In the Hot Sun of a Christmas Day LyricsThey are chasing me
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
But they won't find me
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
I walk the streets
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
Everybody's blind
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
I need my girl
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
She seems to love me, bliss
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
Machine gun
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
They killed someone else
In the hot sun of a Christmas DayEmbed
