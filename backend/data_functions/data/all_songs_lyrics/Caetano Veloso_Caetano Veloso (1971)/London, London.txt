London, London LyricsI'm wandering round and round, nowhere to go
I'm lonely in London, London is lovely so
I cross the streets without fear
Everybody keeps the way clear
I know, I know no one here to say hello
I know they keep the way clear
I am lonely in London without fear
I'm wandering round and round, nowhere to go
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Oh Sunday, Monday, Autumn pass by me
And people hurry on so peacefully
A group approaches a policeman
He seems so pleased to please them
It's good, at least, to live and I agree
He seems so pleased, at least
And it's so good to live in peace
And Sunday, Monday, years, and I agree
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
I choose no face to look at, choose no way
I just happen to be here, and it's ok
Green grass, blue eyes, grey sky
God bless silent pain and happiness
I came around to say yes, and I say
Green grass, blue eyes, grey sky
God bless silent pain and happiness
I came around to say yes, and I say
But my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Yes, my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Whow, my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Oh, my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Yes, my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Whow, my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Oh, my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Whow, my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Yes, my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky . Embed
