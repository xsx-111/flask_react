Shoot Me Dead LyricsShoot me dead or be good or
Shoot me dead or say that you'd die for me
All is said, understood and
All is said, understood
And clear to see
Don’t waste your time in saying
Don’t waste your time in looking for sorrow
I’m as sure of the past as
I’m certain about tomorrow
All I know about you is
All you know about me is misinformation
All we know about death is
All we know about life in this situation
Your eyes try to detect what
Your eyes try to detect an explanation
My eyes are blinded by
The far off look of new expectations
Morena, morena
Morena, morena
Oh! Morena, morena . Embed
