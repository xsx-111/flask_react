A Little More Blue LyricsOne day I had to leave my country
Calm beach and palm tree
That day I couldn't even cry
And I forgot that outside there would be other men
But today, but today, but today, I don't know why
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
The day Carmen Miranda died
They put a photograph in the magazine
Her dead mouth with red lipstick smiled
And people cried, I was about ten
But today, but today, but today, I don't know why
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
One morning they came to take me to jail
I smiled at them and said: "Alright!"
But alone in that same night
I cried and cried again
But today, but today, but today, I don't know why
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
One night I saw a mexican film
These twin brothers tryed to kill each other
She opened her arms and got two bullets
And died sweetly without a sigh
But tonight, but tonight, but tonight, I don't know why
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
One day I went down to the underground
But I missed the last train
And now that I'm just looking around
I feel a little more blue than then
Look around, look around, look around, I don't know why
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
Little more blue than then
Little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then Embed
