The Lonely One Lyrics
For all the lonely ones
Who live life in the dreams
It's so cold and lonely outside
So it seems

So you keep on searching
Anyway
Maybe you'll find someone tomorrow
'Cause you haven't today

So let your mind be carried
With the breeze
For you know you're not the one's who carry
The disease

'Cause you're the lonely one
The only one
The lonely one

So let your mind be carried
With the breeze
For you know you're not the one's who carry
The disease
'Cause you're the lonely one
The only one
The lonely oneEmbed
