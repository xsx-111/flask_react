No One Wants an Alien Lyrics
Looking from the inside you feel
Nothing on the outside is real
Does it really show?

All the other kids put you down
No one ever wants you around
No one want's an alien

Never, never thought you could feel
'Cause everything around you stands still
But will they ever know?

Dreaming of a place far away
Know that you were born here a stray
Does it really show?

Can't make it playing their games
When everyone plays it all the same
No one wants an alien

Never, never thought you could feel
'Cause everything around you stands still
But will they ever know?
Looking from the inside you feel
Nothing on the outside is real
Does it really show?

The vision keeps coming at you still
'Cause something deep inside you is real
But will they ever know?

Never, never thought you could feel
'Cause everything around you stands still
No one wants an alienEmbed
