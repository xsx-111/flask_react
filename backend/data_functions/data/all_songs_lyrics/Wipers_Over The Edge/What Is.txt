What Is Lyrics
What keeps the world on spinning?
What keeps the stars in the sky?
What is reaction without no reason?

What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?

Where is the truth with no beginning?
What's with the look in your eyes?
Where do we go when we go bye-bye?

What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
Why do people hate each other?
Why came we just be brother and sister?
Only that, the sky's so grey

What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?

Why does the truth hurt so badly
When only lies get you by?
Why is love so surreal?

What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human being?
What is this thing
Human Being?
What is this thing
Human Being?Embed
