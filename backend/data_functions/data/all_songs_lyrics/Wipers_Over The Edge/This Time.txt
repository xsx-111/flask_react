This Time Lyrics
Don't wanna be a part of you
Cause you always make me feel a fool
Can't you see it's a matter of fact?
Plain as day, as white and black

This time
It's gonna change
This time
It's gonna change
For me, for you

Do you believe those things they said?
All this trash they fill your head
Can't you see it's a matter of fact? Aw
Plain as day, as white and black

This time
It's gonna change
This time
It's gonna change
For me, for you
Do you wanna be a part of this?
Don't you feel the things you miss?
Can't you see it's a matter of fact?
Plain as day, as white and black

This time
It's gonna change
This time
It's gonna change
For me, for youEmbed
