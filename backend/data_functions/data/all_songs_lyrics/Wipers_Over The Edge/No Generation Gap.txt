No Generation Gap Lyrics
Has it been so long since you had your way?
With no respect, don't they understand?
The reasons for this day's plan
And the risk they take for our demands

I could write a long, long novel
About the situation that presents
No explaining, no complaining, no restraining
There's no generation gap
Generation gap
Generation gap
Generation gap

Has it been so long since you had your way?
With no response, don't they understand?
The reason for this day's plan
And the risk they take at our command

I could write a long, long novel
About the situation that presents
No explaining, no complaining, no restraining
There's no generation gap, no
Generation gap, no
Generation gap, no
Generation gap, no
No generation gap here
I could write a long, long novel
About the situation that presents
No explaining, no complaining, no restraining
There's no generation gap, no
Generation gap, no
Generation gap, no
Generation gap, no
No generation gap here

No generation gap
No generation gap
No generation gap
No generation gapEmbed
