Over the Edge Lyrics
It's not the truth I see
It's just a mockery
Don't need to waste my time
You know I've really tried
You take and never give
Make it so hard to live

I'm hangin' on a ledge
Push me over the edge

Don't do the things you do
Don't have to oblige you
Makin choices on my own
Dont buy their trite or drone
Grow up and be a man
Drop dead right where you stand

I'm hangin' on a ledge
Push me over the edge

It's not the truth I see
It's just a mockery
Don't need to waste my time
You know I've really tried
You take and never give
Make it so hard to live
I'm hangin' on a ledge
Push me over the edgeEmbed
