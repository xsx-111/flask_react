Romeo Lyrics
Romeo
He walks the city at night
The tall dark buildings cast this ghostly shadow into his burning eyes

Oh, Romeo
Roam, Romeo
Romeo, roam
Roam, Romeo
Yeah

Romeo
He cruises the streets at night
Under his feet lay the remains of all the cruisers before him
When out of the alley comes these green laser eyes
Saying, "Get closer, get closer..."

Juliet!
He's still alone

Oh, Romeo
Roam, Romeo
Romeo, roam
Roam, Romeo
Yeah

Oh, Romeo
Roam, Romeo
Romeo, roam
Roam, Romeo

Romeo
He walks the cities at night
The tall dark buildings cast a ghostly shadow into his burning eyes

Around the corners, there's nothing there
Nothing there, nothing there
Juliet! Juliet!
Well there is no Juliet, babe... whoo!

Oh, Romeo
Roam, Romeo
Romeo, roam
Roam, Romeo
Whoo!
'Cause there's no Juliet
'Cause there's no Juliet
'Cause there's no Juliet

Oh, Romeo
Roam, Romeo
Romeo, roam
Roam, Romeo
Whoo!
Oh, Romeo
Roam, Romeo
Romeo, roam
Roam, Romeo
Whoo!
Oh, Romeo
Roam, Romeo
Romeo, roam
Roam, Romeo
Whoo!Embed
