Doom Town Lyrics
Life's so incomplete
Out on the street

Living in doom town
Living in doom town

Nothing will ever change
Always stay the same

Living in doom town
Living in doom town
Living in doom town
Living in doom town

Doom
Town
Doom
Town
Doom
Town
People with blank stares
No one who cares

Living a doom town
Living a doom town

You can never win
Living innocent

Living a doom town
Living a doom town
Living a doom town
Living a doom town

Living a doom town
Living a doom town
Living a doom town
Living a doom town

Living a doom town
Living a doom town
Living a doom town
Living a doom
