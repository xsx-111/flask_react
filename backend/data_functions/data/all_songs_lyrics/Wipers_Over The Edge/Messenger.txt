Messenger Lyrics
Messenger
Always brings bad news
Just a trick of fate
Am I the one you abuse?

You got me all choked up
Riding in the wind
Don't get left behind

So easy to see
Oh I can't complain
What's this trick up your sleeve?
Am I the one you'll blame?

You got me all messed up
Riding through the wind
Don't get left behind

Messenger
Always brings bad news
Just a trick of fate
Am I the one you abuse?
You got me all messed up
Riding through the wind
Don't get left behindEmbed
