So Young Lyrics
Set apart from the rest of the world
Caught up in the material world
With the forces of darkness on your side
No place to run, no place to hide

Only good die young
Only good die young
Only good die young
Only good die young
Oh, so young

Life's a struggle every day
Try so hard in your own way
Just waiting, waiting for the day
When strength and numbers come your way

Only good die young
Only good die young
Only good die young
Only good die young
Oh, so young
From the bottom to the top
Wondering where your life will stop
They can't let you speak your mind
Must control you and your kind
Power's for those who just can't feel
Ripped from tit, put in steel
Nothing's lost when nothing's real
Nothing's lost when nothing's real

Only good die young
Only good die young
Only good die young
Only good die young
Oh, so young

Life's a struggle every day
Try so hard in your own way
Just waiting, waiting for the day
When strength and numbers come your wayEmbed
