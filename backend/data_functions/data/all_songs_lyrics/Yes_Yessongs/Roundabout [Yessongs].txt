Roundabout  LyricsI'll be the round about
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound
In and out the valley
The muses dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I'll spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound
In and out the valley
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too, come on
Twenty-four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you
I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distance atmosphere
Call it morning driving through the sound and
Even in the valley
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Come on, come on, come on
Twenty-four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you
Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching
Down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees
The rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather
Spins out of hand
Go closer hold the land feel partly no more
Than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers
By in our hand
Next to your deeper fears we stand
Surrounded by million years
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky they stand there
Twenty four before my love and I'll be there
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
We spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound
In and out the valley, eh
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you
