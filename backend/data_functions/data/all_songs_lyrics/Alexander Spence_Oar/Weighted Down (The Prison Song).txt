Weighted Down (The Prison Song) LyricsWeighted down by possessions
Weighted down by the gun
Waited down by the river for you to come
My darling, you're darning my action
Of when three months, I was gone
But whose socks were you darning, darling
While I been gone so long?
Weighted down by possessions
Weighted down by the gun
Waited down by the river for you to come
A best friend to your ear of true said I was guilty of sin
Said my being gone was the best thing for you
But the truth, it all comes through for me and my kin
It wasn't the best thing for me but was the best for him
Weighted down by decision
Weighted down by the gun
Waited down by the river for you to come
Weighted down by possessions
Weighted down by the gun
Waited down by the river for you to come
While I sat there wondering, you thought that eyes were hid
And I had the honor of watching everything you did
So now I come with words of pain to bring you news of life
If you can't find your woman, don't take another's wife
Waiting down by possessions
Waiting down with a gun
Waiting down by the river for you to comeEmbed
