Broken heart LyricsA broken heart would be lovely
Broken on the ground
A knife stuck in the ribs of me
Would be better be found
Hanging tree blowing gently
A noose would be ignored
Than to stand upon the receiving end
Of the right hand of the Lord
Like a thirsty cowboy
In a lake his tongue does rest
Jumps in and he cannot swim
And drowns himself to death
Or a frozen mountaineer
He chugs up to a stop
Catching his boot heel in a rock
Two miles from the top
An Olympic super swimmer
Whose belly doesn't flop
A super racecar driver
Whose pit, it can't be stopped
A honey dripping hipster
Whose bee cannot be bopped
Better to be rolled in oats
Than from the roll be dropped
A broken heart would satisfy
Broken in a mess
A severed eye would gratify
My soul, I must confess
I'd rather have no eyes at all
Be blind upon the floor
Than to stand upon the receiving end
Of the right hand of the Lord
Than to stand upon the receiving end
Of the right hand of the LordEmbed
