Grey/afro LyricsSeems that every time I talk to you
You have something else to do
If I were to fall in line with you
Would you call me the same as I call you
Frightful days that we are living in
But it seems if hopes get in your way
We'll take our time and show the life I count out
Open up the chance I have with you right there
Between my lips are words that surface through you
I'm just trying to get a message through you
To you, for you, I will
By you, saw you, know you
I do, you plan to do, if you
His lies, his lies come just too late
Colored white and gold and yellow and red
In the timing of the soul that's right
Then we'll look at how my death is spread
Do you know you ask and you shall live
And die then you can turn to sin
And if I had a lovely home with a bunch of girls
With me, they can't help you
Believe me if I do what I did
I will have euphoria
To be sure
I don't give a damn
Live in peace
Do anything
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look at who's caught swearing
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh I dread the damned
Do, do, da, da
Do, do, da, da
Do, do, da, da
Do, do, da, da
Do, do, da, da
Do, do, da
You came so softly as not to disturb your sleep
I will come into your dream tonight completely
Not to prevent one would sell to you dear
I would do anything at all for you
Let us start a nice old new organization
To try and be hands heaven from this civilization
Only trust in our destination, you need me
And only then I'd let you hide behind me
Do not let's be right as you have a few
Ask me what to do, and I'll come
Hmm.. Ask me what to do then, so softly
And if I know within' your eyes, can I
And if it don't work then, then I was kidding now
If it don't work then, then I was kidding nowEmbed
