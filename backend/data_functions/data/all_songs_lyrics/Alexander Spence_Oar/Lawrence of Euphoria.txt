Lawrence of Euphoria LyricsI'm Lawrence of Euphoria
I'll share your tent, pay your rent
It's worth every single cent
I'm Lawrence of Euphoria
You'll rise from the deep
Come in to sleep
No more will you weep
I'm Lawrence from Euphoria
There's Vivian from Oblivion
She does it for free
For my friends and me
She's Vivian, I'm Lawrence
Lawrence of Euphoria
Hey, there's Ellie Mae from Californi-ay
She does it all right, yea her lips are tight
She tucks me in to bed at night
She's Vivian's twin sister Ellie May
I'm Lawrence of Euphoria
She's Vivian's twin sister Ellie May
I'm Lawrence of EuphoriaEmbed
