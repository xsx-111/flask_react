War In Peace LyricsIt's a joy to know you're resting in peace
War in peace, what a funny combination
Will come to separation
Since you believe
Good old spice it's nice to see you last, you're ahead
War in peace, what a funny combination
Will come to your coronation
This is clear
It's a joy to see you in your red risen dead
Risen dead will cross another generation
And the cosmic federation
Sees you clearEmbed
