Dixie Peach Promenade LyricsI could use me some yin for my yang
That would make everything all right
I will stay by your side by the day
If you'll stay underneath me at night
I bought me some zen food
To learn me how to think
But I can't think of anything more that I'd adore
Than to see you in the pink, yea baby
I could use some bag for my lance
A little left for my hoochie-koo
And I've searched everywhere in heaven
But I've never found a friend like you
I bought them magazines
Print I could not read
I took every bit of stuff
From A to Z
I could use some yin for my yang
That would make everything all right
I will stay by your side for today
If you'll stay underneath me tonight
If you'll stay underneath me tonight
If you'll stay underneath me tonightEmbed
