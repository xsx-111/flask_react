Cripple Creek LyricsA cripple on his deathbed
And the daydream he did ride
All past the streams of fire
On a petal path did glide
He left his wheelchair spinning
Deeper in the mud
In it set his memories
Its body and its blood
An angel came to greet him
By his side she flew
Whispered, as a part of him
What he already knew
His head was spinning freely
And it was plain to see
His burden was himself, he bore
The sight his eyes could see
His death, it died quite easily
Right there, was gone for good
But he couldn't see his loved one
Like he thought he should
He thought if they were gone, said he
And this cannot be true
The search to find what wasn't there
Has brought him back to youEmbed
