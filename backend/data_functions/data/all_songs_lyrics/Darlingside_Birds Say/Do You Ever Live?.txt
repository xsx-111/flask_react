Do You Ever Live? LyricsAre you
Adrift?  Are you
Hands at 10 and 2?
Are you the spinning wheel
As it starts to reel?
Or the tallship on a summer lawn?
The tiller yaws, the ripple moving blade to blade
Makes a figure eight
Only
Only time
Only time will tell if you’re the sea itself
Or an echoing shell
Do you ever live? (x3)
Are you
Someone else?
Are you someone else
Or is someone else you?
Oh, what can you do
If you’re the only passenger
You’ve come from where you’re coming to, but there may be
An unraveling seam
Wake up
Low-angle sun
Ivy runners have begun
To climb the starboard walls
And they start to call:
Do you ever live? (x3)
Only
Only love
Only love will show us where we have to go
Set off
Into the vale
Make your way into the trail of intersecting shoots
One of which is you
Do you ever live? (x5)Embed
