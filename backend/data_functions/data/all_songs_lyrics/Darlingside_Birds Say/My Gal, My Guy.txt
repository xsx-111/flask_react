My Gal, My Guy LyricsMy gal she's the bluest ocean, she
Waits under the bluest sky for me
I belong to her, when I'm in the water
Some folks towel dry but I don't bother
Down we go into the city, oh
Mount Kisco into the city, oh no
Everybody's there, cozy as a cab fare
I'm just gonna jump out for some fresh air
I wake up alone
Is it today or is it tomorrow?
I put on my feet
Walk out the door into a busy street
(Ooh) The bluest sea
(Ooh) New York City
(Ooh) My gal and me
(Ooh) ...
My guy he's the brightest baby grand
Finds all of the brightest things he can
Violet indigo, leaves them on my pillow
Some call it a sham but I just find it so...
Oh, the places we could take some time
All the places we could spend some quality time
Let's go overseas, let's go to the movies
Everything looks better in old cities
I wake up alone
Am I in Amsterdam or Tokyo?
I put on my feet
Walk out the door into a busy street
(Ooh) Bright baby grand
(Ooh) New Amsterdam
(Ooh) My guy, my man
(Ooh) ...

(Ooh) Indigo sky
(Ooh) My love and I
(Ooh) My gal, my guy
I wake up alone
Is it today or is it tomorrow?
I put on my feet
Walk out the door into a busy streetEmbed
