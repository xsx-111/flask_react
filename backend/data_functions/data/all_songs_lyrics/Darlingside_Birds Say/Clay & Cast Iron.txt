Clay & Cast Iron LyricsClay and cast-iron, rum-colored silver sunglasses
White gold, sapphire, and apricot soap
French leather purses and saris with painted-on flowers
The smell of old cedar and jasmine perfume
Fig trees, bottles of milk, and sewing machines
The ring Baba gave you that you used to leave by the sink
I gave you away
You told me you take your Darjeeling black with a scone
And, "Always remove your shoes in a home."
That I was your shadow and keeper of secrets and standards
"A gentleman's only as good as his word."
Ice-skating in Kansas City, Crown Center alight
I said Iâ€™d be there in a minute
I stayed on the ice
I gave you awayEmbed
