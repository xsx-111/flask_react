Harrison Ford Lyrics
Dream of chutes and ladders, sleep through two alarms, and
When I stumble through the doorway
With my hands through the arms of the sweater
That the dry cleaner gave me back a size down
Make it to the bus, not a second to spare, but there's
Freeze-frame traffic till the intersection where I'm
Scheduled for a meeting with a man who looks like Harrison Ford

I never can decide, my everyday's always
Everything flies by, I don't know why I try

He says, where have you been? I've been waiting all day
I say, "with all due respect, I'm only six minutes late"
He doesn't say a thing, just nods and pulls out a sword
I match him blow for blow, counter-parry and dodge
But as the battle wears on, we're getting along
He knocks the sword from my hands, says
Congratulations, you've got the job

All the bright stars in the sky
I can never hold on to, I can't let lie
I never can decide, my everyday's always
Everything flies by, I don't know why I try

Harrison and I are on a bird he built
Out of old Sedans, balloons, and duct tape
Projected in the cabin, there's an agent he calls the wolf
She never shows her face, her voice as big as a house
She says, "burn your things and meet me on the roof in an hour"
I think I need to tell my landlord that
I'm gonna be late with the rent

All the bright planets that hang in the air
Never fall down or float away

I never can decide my everyday's always
Everything flies by, I don't know why I try
Never can decide, my everyday's always
Everything flies by, I don't know why I try1Embed
