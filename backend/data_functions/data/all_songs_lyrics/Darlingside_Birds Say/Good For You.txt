Good For You LyricsI was a river out in West Virginia
The Greenbrier Valley guided me on
And I reached out in all directions
And I tried to hold you in my arms
And at the bottom of a deep caldera
I saw the fading Oregon light
And I felt a comfort in the darkness
Even as it kept me up all night
I want to be good for you
Oh, I was happiness and I was sorrow
Down on that old South Boundary line
And what will I become tomorrow?
Maybe everything will be alright
I donâ€™t want to keep you up all night
I want to be good for you
I stood above the Rocky Mountains
Where Colorado touches New Mexico
And I could see a hundred miles, but
I was many thousand miles from homeEmbed
