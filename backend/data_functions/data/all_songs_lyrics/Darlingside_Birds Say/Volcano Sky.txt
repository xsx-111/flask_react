Volcano Sky LyricsI'm going up the volcano sky is calling
Old as the earth is, the mountains keep on falling
Out of reception and Iâ€™m not sure how to follow
Lines and the colors on the ground all running all over
I'm going up over lakes and over mini car lots
Up over breakfast table conversations open as a notebook
Would you believe?
Would you rely on the scientific method?
Often a thing falls apart the closer up you inspect it
I'm going up to a place where no one ever gets hurt
She's in the voicemail in my pocket as I float above the woods in a t-shirt
Would you believe?
Would you?Embed
