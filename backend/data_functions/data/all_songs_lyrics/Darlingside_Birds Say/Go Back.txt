Go Back Lyrics
We were always on our way
Rolling up our sleeves
Ever moving forward
In the tracks where we lived our simple lives
Kept our blinders on
Eyes to the horizon

I know I’m no doctor but I know
You can’t live in the past
But the only way to go is to go back

And return to who we were
Before we disappeared
Into the thick of big ideas
Now we can see the sweeping view
But we’re waiting out the storm
Stuck under the awning

I know I’m no doctor but I know
You can’t live in the past
But the only way to go is to go back
Into everglades
Greener yesterdays
Skip the stones away
Go back to the start
Photos in the darkroom before they fade
So we hold to who we are
Even into the arc
Beyond our furthest edges
To a world full of strange and towering skies
And a chance to choose in time
To set out on our own way
I know I’m no doctor but I know
You can’t live in the past
But the only way to go is to go back1Embed
