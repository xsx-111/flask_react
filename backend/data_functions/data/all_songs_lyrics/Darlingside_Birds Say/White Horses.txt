White Horses Lyrics
My brother led me outside
Be quiet, I’ve got a light
No moon tonight
Sitting on the ledge outside the second floor
We could hear the sirens running up the road

White horses for Chicago
Black water brings me back home

October, I lose my mind
Cross over Wisconsin line
Apple cider signs
Looking for a trace of our orchard underground
Growing in the basements beneath a brand new town

White horses for Chicago
Black water brings me back home

Every year it's about the same
I'm swimming in my dreams across the lake
In second place
Come the winter I’m driving blind
A tuxedo doing doughnuts on the ice
Black-and-white on white
Doesn't matter if I sleep or follow it out of bed
I know that in the morning it's water in my head
White horses for Chicago
Black water brings me back home
White horses for Chicago
Black water brings me back homeEmbed
