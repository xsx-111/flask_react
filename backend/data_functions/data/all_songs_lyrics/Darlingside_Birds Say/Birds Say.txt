Birds Say LyricsDon’t know what the birds say
Don't know what the birds
Listen to them all day
Nothing sounds like words
Don't know if the colors
Look the same to you
Maybe you see white
The way that I see blue
Birds don't know what you say
Birds don't know what you
Might as well just say
Whatever comes to you
I don’t know where time goes
Don’t know where the timeEmbed
