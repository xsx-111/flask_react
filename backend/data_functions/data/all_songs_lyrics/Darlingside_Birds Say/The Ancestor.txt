The Ancestor LyricsGo on, bury me
Under stone or under sea
Silent pictures
Keep the fishes company
There is little else for me now
But I will find my way
Out of the dark someday
Into a crimson yellow sun
Science fictional
When the morning comes we will
Walk for light years
Watch the nebulas appear
There is little else for me now
But I will find my way
Out of the dark someday
Into a crimson yellow sun
I'll follow my baby boy
He'll be a silver toy
And we'll count the ages as they're ending
But I will find my way
Out of the dark someday
Into a flash of solar inspiration
I'll follow my baby boy
He'll be a silver toy
And we'll count the ages as they're endingEmbed
