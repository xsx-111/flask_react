The Akara LyricsAnd so long, mistress sings
So long, I can't wait
To my love, wait one more
So long, mistress sings
So long, my fate has changed
It's been deranged
So long to these kite strings
So long, I've been saved before
I'm saved once more
I call upon my daring
I call upon, I can't taste anymore
I can't waste anymoreEmbed
