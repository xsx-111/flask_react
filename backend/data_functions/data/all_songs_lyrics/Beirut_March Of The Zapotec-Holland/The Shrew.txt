The Shrew LyricsShe wasn't ever obliged
To lift me a buckle or rise
And once her eyes covered with flies
The pain she no longer disguised
Windows that I'm terrorized in time
Never to ignite
There was once a time we sighed
It holds each one in light
'Til the market left right
How long she's been by my side
But at last, the stable's retiredEmbed
