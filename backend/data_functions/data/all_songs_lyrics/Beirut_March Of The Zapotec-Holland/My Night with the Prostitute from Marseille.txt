My Night with the Prostitute from Marseille LyricsAnd we believed her then
And we believed her then
And we believed her then
And we believed her then
And now outside you see the waves in her eyes
And I, I won't mind what you decide to swear by
And now outside you see the waves in her eyes
And I, I won't mind what you decide to swear by
And now outside I see your eyes meet the sky
And I, I don't mind what you decide to swear by
And now outside I see your eyes meet the sky
And I, I won't lie, I kept you here tonight
And I believed her then
And I believed her thenEmbed
