La Llorona LyricsEver away from seeing more than life
The morning lies miles away from the night
No man ever could steal her heart
But with bright gold coins I’ll take my shot
And all it takes to fall
If you don’t walk, might as well crawl
All it takes to fall
What a quiet world after all
Of the things that you guessed will come
What a moment it was after allEmbed
