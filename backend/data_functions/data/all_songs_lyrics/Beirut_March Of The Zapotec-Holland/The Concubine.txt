The Concubine LyricsI've been so tired
One child, I wait for room to spare
I can't wait child and write
"It's all an empire long beheaded"
I am grateful roaming
And so I long for your beacon riverside
Where I rest tonight
Down, autumn falls down
Autumn falls down
And I can hear the sound
All that for miles around it
Autumn falls down
Autumn falls down
And I just roam around
Oh, autumn never lands
Autumn never lands
Autumn falls down
All I can do to end it
I can never end it
Autumn falls down
Autumn falls down
All I can do to end it
I can never end it5Embed
