The Siren LyricsA lady with a violin
Playing to the seals
Hearken to the sound of calling
Who tied my hands to the wheel?
The zodiac turns over me
Somewhere there my fate revealed (Come to me)
I hear but how will I see?
I tied myself to the wheel
The winds talk to my sails not me
Somewhere there my fate revealed (Come to me)
I hear but how will I see?4Embed
