White Night Fantasy LyricsEnchantress
Came to me
And said
"Meet me
At the lake
Tonight"
I hummed
This song
To the white
Through the shroud of snow
I saw
Paradise
Peace
No more lies
Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings
I dream
Of wolves, with them
I run
For me she lengthened
The night
I am home
I am in peace
Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings
Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings
Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings
Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings1Embed
