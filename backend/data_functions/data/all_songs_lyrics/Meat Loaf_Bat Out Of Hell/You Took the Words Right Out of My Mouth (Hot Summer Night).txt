You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night) Lyrics
On a hot summer night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
Will he offer me his mouth?
Yes
Will he offer me his teeth?
Yes
Will he offer me his jaws?
Yes
Will he offer me his hunger?
Yes
Again, will he offer me his hunger?
Yes!
And will he starve without me?
Yes!
And does he love me?
Yes
Yes
On a hot summer night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
Yes
I bet you say that to all the boys

It was a hot summer night
And the beach was burning
There was fog crawling over the sand
Oh, when I listen to your heart
I hear the whole world turning
I see the shooting stars falling
Through your trembling hands
You were licking your lips
And your lipstick shining
I was dying just to ask for a taste
Oh, we were lying together in a silver lining
By the the light of the moon
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste
Oh, well you hold me so close that my knees grow weak
But my soul is flying high above the ground
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound

And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (love you)
And then you took the words right out of my mouth (aah)
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth (aah)
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (love you)
Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water (aah)
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin (aah)
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want to (aah)
Oh, the night is young (aah)
And ain't no-one gonna know where you
No-one gonna know where you
No-one's gonna know where you've been
You were licking your lips (aah)
And your lipstick shining (aah)
I was dying just to ask for a taste (aah)
Oh, we were lying together in a silver lining (aah)
By the the light of the moon (aah)
You know there's not another moment to waste

And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (love you)
And then you took the words right out of my mouth (aah)
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth (aah)
Oh, and I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (love you)
And then you took the words right out of my mouth (must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh- you took the words right out of my mouth (must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh- you took the words right out of my mouth (must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh- you took the words right out of my mouth (must have been while you were kissing me)
Ah- you took the words right out of my mouth (must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh- you took the words right out of my mouth (must have been while you were kissing me)
Oh oh- took the words right out of my mouth (must have been while you were kissing me)
Woah- took the words right out of my mouth (must have been while you were kissing me)

Oh- you took the words right out of my mouth
Woah, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
Woah, it must have been while you were kissing me4Embed
