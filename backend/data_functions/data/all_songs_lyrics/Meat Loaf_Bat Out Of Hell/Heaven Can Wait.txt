Heaven Can Wait Lyrics
Heaven can wait
And a band of angels wrapped up in my heart
Will take me through the lonely night
Through the cold of the day
And I know, I know
Heaven can wait
And all the gods come down here just to sing for me
And the melody's gonna make me fly
Without pain, without fear

Give me all of your dreams
And let me go along on your way
Give me all of your prayers to sing
And I´ll turn the night into the skylight of day
I got a taste of paradise
I´m never gonna let it slip away
I got a taste of paradise
It´s all I really need to make me stay
Just like a child again

Heaven can wait
And all I got is time until the end of time
Well I won´t look back
I won´t look back
Let the altar shine
And I know that I've been released
But I don´t know to where
Nobody's gonna tell me now
And I don't really care, no, no, no
I got a taste of paradise
That's all I really need to make me stay
I got a taste of paradise
If I'd had it any sooner, you know
You know I never would have run away
From my home

Heaven can wait
And all I got is time until the end of time
Well I won't look back, I won't look back
Let the altar shine
Heaven can wait
Woah, Heaven can wait
Well I won't look back, I won't look back
Let the altar shine
Let the altar shine2Embed
