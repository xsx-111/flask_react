For Crying Out Loud Lyrics
I was lost till you were found
But I never knew how far down
I was falling
Before I reached the bottom
I was cold and you were fire
And I never knew how the pyre
Could be burning
On the edge of the ice field

And now the chilly California wind
Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper
In the chilly California sand
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart
And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart
And don't you hear me crying
'Oh Babe, don't go?'
And don't you hear me screaming
'How was I to know?'

I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment
To see the light of the day
And take me to another land
Where I don't have to stay
And I'm gonna need somebody
To make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody
With open arms, open eyes
Open up the sky and let the planet
That I love shine through
For crying out loud
You know I love you
For crying out loud
You know I love you
For crying out loud
You know I love you

I was damned and you were saved
And I never knew how enslaved
I was kneeling
In the chains of my master
I could laugh but you could cry
And I never knew just how high
I was flying
Ah with you right above me

And now the chilly California wind
Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper
In the chilly California sand
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart
And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart
And don't you here me crying
'Oh Babe, don't go?'
And don't you hear me screaming
'How was I to know?'
I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment
To see the light of the day
And take me to another land
Where I don't have to stay
And I'm gonna need somebody
To make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody
With open arms, open eyes
Open up the sky and let the planet
That I love shine through

For crying out loud
You know I love you
For crying out loud
You know I love you
For crying out loud
You know I love you
For crying out loud
You know I love you
For taking in the rain when I'm feeling so dry
For giving me the answers when I'm asking you why
My oh my, for that I thank you
For taking in the sun when I'm feeling so cold
For giving me a child when my body is old
Don't you know for that I need you
For coming to my room when you know I'm alone
For finding me a highway and for driving me home
And you've gotta know
For that I serve you
For pulling me away when I'm starting to fall
For revving me up when I'm starting to stall
And all in all for that I want you
For taking and for giving and for playing the game
For praying for my future in the days that remain
Oh Lord for that I hold you

Ah but most of all
For crying out loud
For that I love you
Ah but most of all
For crying out loud
For that I love you
Ah but most of all
For crying out loud
For that I love you

When you're crying out loud
You know I love you2Embed
