All Revved Up with No Place to Go Lyrics
I was nothing but a lonely boy
Looking out for something new
And you were nothing but a lonely girl
But you were something
Something like a dream come true

I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block
When I played my guitar, I made the canyons rock

But every Saturday Night
I felt the fever grow
Do you know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go?
Do you know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go?

And in the middle of a steamy night
I'm tossing in my sleep
And in the middle of a red-eyed dream
I see you coming
Coming on to give it to me
Well, I was out on the prowl, down by the edge of the track
And like a son of a jackal, I'm the leader of the pack

But every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do you know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go?
Do you know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go?

Oh baby I'm a hunter in the dark of the forest
I've been stalking you and tracking you down
Cruising up and down the main drag all night long
We could be standing at the top of the world
Instead of sinking further down in the mud
You and me, 'round about midnight
You and me, 'round about midnight
Someone got to draw first, draw first
Someone got to draw first blood
Someone got to draw first blood
Ooh, I got to draw first blood
Ooh, I got to draw first blood
Well, I was out on the prowl, down by the edge of the track
And like a son of a jackal, I'm the leader of the pack

But every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do you know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go?
Do you know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go?

I was nothing but a lonely all-American boy
Oh, looking out for something to do
And you were nothing but a lonely all-American girl
But you were something like a dream come true

I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block
And when I played my guitar, I made the canyons rock

But every Saturday Night
I felt the fever grow
All revved up with no place to go
All revved up with no place to go
All revved up with no place to go
All revved up with no place to go
All revved up with no place to goEmbed
