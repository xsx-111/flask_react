King of the World Lyrics
Hello one and all
Was it you I used to know?
Can't you hear me call
On this old ham radio
All I got to say
I'm alive and feeling fine
Should you come my way
You can share my poison wine
No marigolds in the promised land
There's a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world as far as I know
I won't take your bread
I don't need no helping hand
I can't be no savage
I can't be no highwayman
Show me where you are
You and I will spend this day
Drivin' in my car
Through the ruins of Santa Fe
No marigolds in the promised land
There's a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world as far as I know

I'm reading last year's papers
Although I don't know why
Assassins, cons and rapers
Might as well die
When you come around
No more pain and no regrets
Watch the sun go brown
Smoking cobalt cigarettes
There's no need to hide
Taking things the easy way
If I stay inside
I might live till Saturday
No marigolds in the promised land
There's a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world
King of the world, as far as I know
