Show Biz Kids Lyrics
You go to Las Wages
Las Wages
You go to Las Wages
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
After closing time
At the Guernsey fair
I detect the El Supremo
From the room at the top of the stairs
Well I've been around the world
And I've been in the Washington zoo
And in all my travels
As the facts unravel
I've found this to be true
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
They got the house on the corner
With the rug inside
They got the booze they need
All that money can buy
They got the shapely bodies
They got the Steely Dan T-shirt
And for the Coup de gr√¢ce
They're outrageous
Oh, honey let me tell you

While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night

Show business kids making movies of themselves
You know they don't give a fuck about anybody else
You know you gonna

While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
