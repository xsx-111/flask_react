Night People LyricsBiblical sky speckled with flame
Do you hold your mother's eyes
From wetting the earth?
From weeping for those
Who reward fame to absolutes of war?
Or for heroic myths
Provided to children
Married into ferocity?
They instead witness themselves
And the black sand of your body slipped through
And the black sand of your body slipped through
And the black sand of your body slipped through
And the black sand of your body
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I spied along the concrete canvas
A woman, her eyes brimming with vacancy
And bear her hugging barbiturates
Her head rolled from faint shoulders
And skipped three times
Each thud sprouting a fountain
Of splashing goldEmbed
