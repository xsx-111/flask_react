You Without End Lyrics
"He pained, shifting his attention toward the mirror across the road
Back into his daydream
The spliff burned his fingers the second he drank, and he tossed it toward the gutter
The smoke burned into his eyes, blinding him
As he blinked through the tears, the pain began to recede
Back down the promenade and homeward bound, as he approached the intersection of Brooklyn and Lakeshore, a flock of geese burst from the darkness and flew, shrieking into what was left of the evening."

In a dark tunnel
And new dawn approaching
With a sphere of light
Ever glowing

And then the world will know
Will know of you
Of all things love
Of all things true

"He looked up to watch them form a ghostly Chevron with flashes of white from their exposed chest, blinking like so many eyes. Crossing the street drenched him in fluorescent light, and he quickened his pace until he reached the softer light of the street lamps."

Let it go as it grows on forever
And let it go
Let it go as it grows
Breathe it in
Let it go as it grows on forever
And we breathe it in
And we breathe it in
And then the world will grow
And then the world will grow
And then the world will know
Of all true love, true1Embed
