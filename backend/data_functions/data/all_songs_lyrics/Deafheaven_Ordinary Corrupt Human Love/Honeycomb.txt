Honeycomb LyricsShadows extend east
And Cortazar
Stares at women
Shuffling by who blot their lips
From violent men
And say "god bless you"
From violent men
And say "god bless you"
I sulk with pause and
Loving mariachi soars
Against the red
And yellow tents of strangers
Shout!
The red and yellow tents of strangers
Gifting geese
The ends of bread
The ends of bread
The ends of bread
8, 12, 13 hours
8, 12, 13 hours and
The people keep fighting for sleep
The people keep fighting for rest
I'm reluctant to stay sad
Life beyond is a field
A field of flowers
A field of flowers
Life beyond is a field
My love is a nervous child lapping
From the glowing lagoon of their presence
A field of flowers
My love is a nervous child lapping
From the glowing lagoon of their presence
A field of flowers
My love is a bulging, blue-faced fool
Hung from the throat by sunflower stems
Hung from the throat by sunflower stems
Sunflower stems2Embed
