Canary Yellow LyricsStaring out onto the earthly, pottery of
Pottery of existence, climbing light
Climbing light vines to heaven
Clay ribbons descend
Swirl downward against
Staring out onto the earthly, pottery of
Pottery of existence, climbing light
Climbing light vines to heaven
Clay ribbons descend
Swirl downward against
Downward against metallic swell
Go sail, go sail, go sail, go sail, go sail
Downward against metallic swell
Go sail charmer, altruist
Staring out onto the earthly, pottery of
Pottery of existence, climbing light
Climbing light vines to heaven
Clay ribbons descend
Swirl downward against
Go sail, charmer, altruist
Who immersed in thickets
Hugged in cloth
Evolves into charcoal
Worshipped by the drifting macaw
The lady finch
The lady finch
They swoop and croon through the air
Dip their feathers
In the death paste of ash water
Go!
I have wondered about the language of flowers, and
I have wondered about the language of flowers
And you, elaborate mosaic, greeting me
Gentle, the swamp takes my ankles
On and on we choke on an everlasting
Handsome night
My lover’s blood rushes right through me
Wild, wild and fantastic
And wild, fantastic
An everlasting night
Handsome night
My lover’s blood rushes right through me
An everlasting night
Handsome night
My lover’s blood rushes right through me
On and on and on we choke on (My lover’s blood)
On and on and on we choke on (My lover’s blood)
An everlasting, handsome night (My lover’s blood)
My lover’s blood rushes right through me (My lover’s blood)
On and on and on we choke on (My lover’s blood)
On and on and on we choke on (My lover’s blood)
An everlasting, handsome night (My lover’s blood)
My lover’s blood rushes right through me
(My lover’s blood rushes right through me)
On and on and on we choke on (My lover’s blood)
On and on and on we choke on (My lover’s blood)
An everlasting, handsome night
My lover’s blood rushes right through me
(My lover’s blood rushes right through me)
On and on and on we choke on (My lover’s blood)
On and on and on we choke on (My lover’s blood)
An everlasting, handsome night
My lover’s blood rushes right through me
(My lover’s blood rushes right through me)
On and on and on we choke on
On and on and on we choke on
An everlasting, handsome night
My lover’s blood rushes right through me4Embed
