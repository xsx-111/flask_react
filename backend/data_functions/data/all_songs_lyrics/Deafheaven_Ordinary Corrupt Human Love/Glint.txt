Glint LyricsListening to muffled footsteps
Of those brushing
Reaching grasses
Seeing the last letters of my name
Seeing the last letters of my name
Faded and shy
Imagining us clasping hands in holiday
Imagining us clasping hands in holiday
Imagining you growing older
Growing somehow more beautiful
Imagining you growing older
Somehow more beautiful
Surrounded by your children
And children's
Children
The midnight blue
The midnight blue of your calmness
Evening chamomile
Surrounded by
All your children's children
The midnight blue
Of your calmness
Evening chamomile
Eyes as a morning rosewater
Eyes as a morning rosewater
I'm
I'm shrinking into your gown
Tearing the pink linen of your belly
Burying into your abdomen
And sewing the seam of your skin
I'm
I'm shrinking into your gown
Tearing the pink linen of your belly
Burying into your abdomen
And sewing the seam of your skin
