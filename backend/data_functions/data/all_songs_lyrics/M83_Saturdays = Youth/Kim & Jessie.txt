Kim & Jessie Lyrics
Kim and Jessie
They have a secret world in the twilight
Kids outside worlds
They're crazy 'bout romance and illusions

Somebody lurks in the shadows
Somebody whispers
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Dream dressed in blue
It's all they need for now and forever
Chased by the moon
They shatter their whole peace with singing

Somebody lurks in the shadows
Somebody whispers
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So we can drown our towns with voices
So possible to like it as one
And soon they'll be flying
Say of course, say you're lovely
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Somebody whispers
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Yeah, yeah, yeah6Embed
