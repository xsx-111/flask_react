Up! Lyrics
If I clean my rocket
We'll go flying today
And we'll hit the pockets
Of warm and crispy air
If I clean my rocket
We'll go flying today
And we'll hit the pockets
Of warm and crispy air

Oh, you lovely boy, you smell so sweet
We ride so well
And we load our pistols as we perch upon
My razor wings

Up to the planets, up to the bodies of the galaxy
We fly, we feed, we suck, we bleed, we need

If I clean my rocket
We'll go flying today
And we'll hit the pockets
Of warm and crispy air
If I clean my rocket
We'll go flying today
And we'll hit the pockets
Of warm and crispy air
Oh, we flee the scene of our little crime
We feel so free
But the hounds of law, they bite our heels
As we retreat

Up to the planets up to the bodies of the galaxy
We fly, we feed, we suck, we bleed, we need

If I clean my rocket
And we'll hit the pockets
If I clean my rocket
And we'll hit the pockets
If I clean my rocket
And we'll hit the pockets
If I clean my rocket
And we'll hit the pocketsEmbed
