Skin of the Night Lyrics
Like a moth she moves to the red light
Her blood warms and boils there
She skims the sweat like a new milk
And pops the buttons of her wet blouse

Oh, queen of the night
(All of her soft parts call to me)
Well she is deep inside
(She could be mine)
She is haunting me

She digs her nails into her naked chest
Her veins fan out like a road map
She pulls back the skin to show her ribs
That twinkle like shooting stars

Oh, queen of the night
(All of her soft parts call to me)
Well she is deep inside
(She could be mine)
She is haunting me2Embed
