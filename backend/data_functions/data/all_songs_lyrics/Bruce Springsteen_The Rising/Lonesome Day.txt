Lonesome Day Lyrics
Baby, once I thought I knew
Everything I needed to know about you
Your sweet whisper, your tender touch
I didn't really know that much

Joke's on me, but it's going to be okay
If I can just get through this lonesome day

Lonesome day

Hell's brewing, dark sun's on the rise
This storm will blow through, by and by
House is on fire, vipers in the grass
Little revenge and this too shall pass

This too shall pass, darling, yeah I'm going to pray
Right now, all I got is this lonesome day

Lonesome day
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah

Better ask questions before you shoot
Deceit and betrayal's a bitter fruit
It's hard to swallow, come time to pay
That taste on your tongue don't easily slip away

Thy kingdom come, I'm going to find my way
Yeah, through this lonesome day

Lonesome day
Lonesome day
Lonesome day

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
Lonesome day
Lonesome day
