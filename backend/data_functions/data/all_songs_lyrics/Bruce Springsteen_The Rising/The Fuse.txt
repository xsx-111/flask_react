The Fuse Lyrics
Down at the court house they're ringing the flag down
Long black line of cars snaking slow through town
Red sheets snapping on the line
With this ring will you be mine

The fuse is burning
Shut out the lights
The fuse is burning
Come on let me do you right

Trees on fire with the first fall's frost
Long black line in front of Holy Cross
Blood moon rising in a sky of black dust
Tell me baby, who do you trust?

The fuse is burning
Shut out the lights
The fuse is burning
Come on let me do you right

Tires on the highway hissing that something's coming
You can feel the wires in the tree tops humming
Devil's on the horizon line
Your kiss and I'm alive
Quiet afternoon in the empty house
On the edge of the bed, you slip off your blouse
The room is burning with the noon sun
Your bittersweet taste on my tongue

The fuse is burning
Shut out the lights
The fuse is burning
Come on let me do you right1Embed
