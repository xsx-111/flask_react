Tomorrow Is My Turn Lyrics
Though some may reach for the stars
Others will end behind bars
What the future has in store no one ever knows before
Yet we would all like the right to find the key to success
That elusive ray of light that will lead to happiness

Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
Make life worth living
Now it's my life I'm living

My only concern for tomorrow is my turn
Now the summer is gone, there's another to come
You can't stop years from drifting by even if you want to try
Though time may help you forget all that has happened before
But honey it's too late to regret what is gone will be no more
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
Make life worth living
Now it's my life I'm living

My only concern for tomorrow is my turn1Embed
