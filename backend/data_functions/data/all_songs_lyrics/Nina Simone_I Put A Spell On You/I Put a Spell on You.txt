I Put a Spell on You Lyrics
I put a spell on you
'Cause you're mine

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, ah
You better stop the things you do
I ain't lyin'
No, I ain't lyin'
You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
You know better, daddy
I can't stand it 'cause you put me down
Yeah, yeah

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You're mine


I love ya
I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow
And I don't care
If you don't want me
I'm yours right now
Ah, you hear me
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine9Embed
