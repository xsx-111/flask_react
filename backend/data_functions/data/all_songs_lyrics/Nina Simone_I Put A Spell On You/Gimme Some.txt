Gimme Some LyricsLoving is the thing I crave
For your love, I'd be your slave
(Oh, gimme some)
Yeah, gimme me some
(Gimme some)
Oh yeah
I can't stand it no longer
(Come on) Gimme some
Don't be bashful, come over here
Whisper some sweet words in my ear
(Oh, gimme some)
And gimme some
(Gimme some)
Gimme some
I can't wait eight days
(Come on) Gimme some
Come on over here and fill my cup
Love me so hard I can't stand up
(Oh, gimme some)
Gimme some
(Gimme some)
Give me some
Don't you know I love it?
(Come on) Gimme some
Just a closer walk would be
Doo wah diddy daddy one two three
(Oh, gimme some)
Gimme some
(Gimme some)
Oh, gimme some
You know I have to have it
(Come on) Gimme some
I know that you wanna do what's right
Just come on and love me all night
(Oh, gimme some)
And gimme some
(Gimme some)
I tell ya, I want some
I can't stand it no longer
(Come on) Gimme some
I like cornbread nice and yellow
So I want you to be my fellow
(Oh, gimme some)
Yeah, gimme some
(Gimme some)
Oh! Gimme some
Don't you know I love it, daddy?
(Come on) Gimme some
Now!
One of these mornings, just about dawn
You'll be working on my lawn
(Oh, gimme some)
Yeah, gimme some
(gimme some)
Gimme some
I can't stand it no longer
(Come on) Gimme some
I declare to my man
You gonna drive me stone insane
(Oh, gimme some)
Gimme some
(Gimme some)
Gimme some
I can't wait eight days
(Come on) Gimme some
I like fried chicken, you know it's true
But there's no sweeter meat in the world than you
I want some day to be your wife
So you can thrill me the rest of life
So stop stalling
Finish your drink and let's get falling
(Oh, gimme some)
Gimme some
(Gimme some)
Oh, gimme some
I can't stand it no longer
Why don't you gimme some?1Embed
