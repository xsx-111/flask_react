People Get Ready Lyrics
People get ready, there's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

So people get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers from coast to coast
Faith is the key, open up the doors and board 'em
There's room for all among who loved the most

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
But there's no hiding place from this kingdom's throne

So people get ready, there's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels humming
You don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord1Embed
