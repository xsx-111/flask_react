Uptown LyricsYeah
I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
If a taxi won't take me, I'll catch a train
I'll go underground, I'll get there just the same
Cus I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
125th street, now here I come, y'all
They're ready for me 'cus I'm coming for fun
I'm gonna eat me some-a-chicken, and some black-eyed peas
Somebody barbequed ribs and some collard greens
I'm gonna party for days in Harlem
Leave the downtown ways for Harlem
Cus I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
If a taxi won't take me, I'll catch a train
I'll go underground, I'll get there just the same
I'm going make it to the Cave and the Shadow Park?
I'm to uptown faces and down to swat?
I'm gonna make it to the play, I'll stand red-goosed too?
I'll break jack the truce and wear a suit?
I'm going to have me a pole? in Harlem
And that ain't all in Harlem
I'm gonna eat some chitlin's and some black-eyed peas
Somebody barbequed ribs and some collard greens
I said I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
I'm going uptown to Harlem
Gonna let my hair down in Harlem
