So Tired LyricsI'm so tired looking for you, looking for you
And no one else will do, no one will do
I love you so, I do, so much
I'm living in the past
And how long can it last?
I need you so much, it's true, so true
Till all in heaven above
Send my love, send my love
Send my love, send my love
For I know I'll never be free, never be free
But maybe she'll come to me, she'll come to me
With open arms and says she, she's lonely too
So tired looking for you
So tired looking for you
Looking for youEmbed
