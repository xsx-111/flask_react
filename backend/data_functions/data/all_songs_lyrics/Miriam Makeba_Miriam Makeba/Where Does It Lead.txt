Where Does It Lead Lyrics
Where does it lead this strange young love of mine?
Only heaven and the lilies know
Where does it lead this strange love of mine
I must go down where the lilies grow

Play on the lily read lonely low
Play to him till he heed to my world

Where does it lead this stranger love of mine
Only heaven and the lilies know

Play on the lily read lonely low
Play to him till he heed to my world

Where does it lead this strange young love of mine?
Any where it takes me I will goEmbed
