The Naughty Little Flea Lyrics
Where did the naughty little flea go?
Won't somebody tell me
Where did the naughty little flea go?
Won't somebody tell me
Tell me now
Where did the naughty little flea go (Nobody know, nobody know)
Tell me now
Where did the naughty little flea go (Nobody know, nobody know)

There was a naughty little flea
He climbed up on the doggie's knee
He climbed some here, he climbed some there
He was climbing everywhere

Tell me, where did the naughty little flea go
(Can somebody tell me)
Nobody knows

Well, he climbed some here, he climbed some there
He was climbing everywhere
And now at last he found a nest
Where he could get some food and rest
Well, he bit him here, he bit him there
He bit him almost everywhere
And when he done, he wanted more
He never tasted such a dog before

Well, where did the naughty little flea go
(Nobody know, nobody know)
Tell me now, where did the naughty little flea go
(Nobody know, nobody know)
Ndixelele ngabi
Ishonephi lo intakumba (Somebody tell me)
Ndixelele, ndixelele
Ishonephi lo intakumba (Won't somebody tell me)
Ndixelele, ndixelele

Well, he bit him here, he bit him there
He chewed him almost everywhere
Well, he bit him on the toe, and the knee and the nose
He bit him everywhere he didn't have clothes
Well the doggie went to see a show
And there he saw Brigitte Badell
The naughty flea said, "What a feast!"
She really is a delicious beast
Tell me, where did the naughty little flea go
(Nobody know, nobody know)
Tell me now, where did the naughty little flea go
(Nobody know, nobody know)
Tell me now, where did the naughty little flea go
(Nobody know, nobody know)
Tell me now, where did the naughty little flea go
(Nobody know, nobody know)

Well, scratch, scratch me back
Scratch, scratch me back
It really is a fact
The less I itch, the more I scratch
Everybody know, scratch, scratch me back (A lil' higher)
Scratch, scratch me back (A lil' higher)
It really is a fact
The less I itch, the more I scratch

Everybody know, where did the naughty little flea go
(Nobody know, nobody know)
Ndixelela, where did the naughty little flea go
(Nobody know, nobody know)Embed
