House Of The Rising Sun LyricsThere is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh Lord is one
Go tell my baby sister
Never do what I have done
To shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm goin' back to end my days
Beneath that Rising SunEmbed
