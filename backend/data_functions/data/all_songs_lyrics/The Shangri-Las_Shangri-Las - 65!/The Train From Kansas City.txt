The Train From Kansas City Lyrics
(Baby, baby)
(Please believe me)
(I would never never)
(Do anything to hurt you)

Baby, baby
Please believe me
I would never never
Do anything to you
To make you blue

But yesterday I
Got this letter
From a boy I loved
Before I ever knew you
Before I even knew you

And the train from Kansas City
Is comin' into town
The train from Kansas City (is a-comin')
Nothing I can do can make it turn around
Baby, baby
Please don't worry
Nothing in this world
Could tear us apart
We'll never, never part

So wait right here
And I will hurry
I'll be back in the time
It takes to break a heart
I gotta break his heart

Yes, the train from Kansas City
Is comin' into town
The train from Kansas City (It's a-comin')
Nothing I can do can make it turn around

Well, I never answered his letter
I just couldn't tell him that way (Oh, yeah)
No, I never answered his letter
Cause I didn't know what to say
Now I'm going down to the station
He'll be there at ten after two (Ooh, yeah)
I'll show him the ring on my finger
I don't know what else I can do

Oh, the train from Kansas City
Is comin' into town
The train from Kansas City (It's a-comin)
Nothing I can do can make it turn around

Here comes the train
Here comes the train
Here comes the trainEmbed
