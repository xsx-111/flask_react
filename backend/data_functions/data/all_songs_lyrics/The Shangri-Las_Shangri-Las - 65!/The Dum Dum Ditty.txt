The Dum Dum Ditty Lyrics
He doesn't talk much
But when he does he sayin' somethin'
(Run-run ditty, run-run ditty)
He lives in the slums
'Cause his folks never had nothin'
(Run-run ditty, run-run ditty)

He's a rebel without a cause
He doesn't do what everyone does

And he makes my heart go run-run ditty
Makes my heart go run-run ditty
Makes my heart go run-run ditty
Boom boom

I see him every day
Hangin' 'round the neighborhood
(Run-run ditty, run-run ditty)
They say stay away
Don't talk to him 'cause he is no good
(Run-run ditty, run-run ditty)
He's a rebel without a cause
He doesn't do what everyone does

And he makes my heart go run-run ditty
Makes my heart go run-run ditty
Makes my heart go run-run ditty
Boom boom

How did he ever get in so much trouble?
(Sha-da da-da, sha da da-da da-da)
Why do the papers always mention his name?
(Sha-da da-da, sha da da-da da-da)

He's a rebel without a cause
He doesn't do what everyone does

And he makes my heart go run-run ditty
Makes my heart go run-run ditty
Makes my heart go run-run ditty
Boom-boom
Oh, yeah! (He makes my heart go run-run ditty)
Oh, yeah! (He makes my heart go run-run ditty)
Oh, yeah! (Makes my heart go run-run ditty)
(Boom boom)
Oh, yeah! (He makes my heart go run-run ditty)
Oh, yeah! (He makes my heart go run-run ditty)
Oh, yeah! (Makes my heart go run-run ditty)...Embed
