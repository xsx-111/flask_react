Heaven Only Knows LyricsI dream about you all the time, yes I do
And I can't sleep at night
(Heaven only knows, mm hmm)
I dream about makin' you mine, yes I do
And of holding you tight
(Heaven only knows, mm hmm)
I've never been sure 'bout a boy before
But I want you to know
(Heaven only knows, mm hmm)
Given you my heart and my soul and my love
'Cause I trust you so
(Heaven only knows, mm hmm)
Heaven only knows that I want you, baby
Every time I see you it drives me crazy
You're the only boy that my heart wants to know
Whoa yeah
Tell me what you want and I'll do it for you
Baby, let me show you that I adore you
Baby, let me go everywhere you go
Whoa yeah
Never been sure 'bout a boy before
But I want you to know
(Heaven only knows, mm hmm)
Given you my heart and my soul and my love
'Cause I trust you so
(Heaven only knows, mm hmm)
Heaven only knows that I want you
(Baby)
Heaven only knows that I need you
(Baby)
Heaven only knows that I love you
(Baby)
Heaven only knows that I want youEmbed
