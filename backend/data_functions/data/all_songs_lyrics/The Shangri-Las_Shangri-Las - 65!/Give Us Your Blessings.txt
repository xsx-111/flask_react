Give Us Your Blessings Lyrics
(Run, run, run)
(Mary, run, run, run)
(Jimmy, run, run, run)
(Mary, run, run, run)
Mary and Jimmy were both very young
But as much in love as two people could be
And all they wanted was to share that love
Eternally

They went to their folks they told them
That someday soon they'd be wed
Their folks just laughed and called them kids
So Mary said

"Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day"

They wouldn't have laughed at Mary
If they could have seen through the door
'Cause Jimmy was waiting in the car
While Mary begged them once more
"Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day"

(Well as they drove off they were crying)
(And nobody knows for sure)
(That, that's why they didn't see the sign)
(That road detour)

The next day when they found them
Mary and Jimmy were dead
And as their folks knelt beside them in the rain
They couldn't help but hear
The last words that Mary had said

"Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day"

(Run, run, run)
(Mary, run, run, run)
Give us your blessings
(Jimmy, run, run, run)
On our wedding day
(Mary, run, run, run)
Give us your blessings
(Jimmy, run, run, run)
On our wedding day
(Mary, run, run, run)
Give us your blessingsEmbed
