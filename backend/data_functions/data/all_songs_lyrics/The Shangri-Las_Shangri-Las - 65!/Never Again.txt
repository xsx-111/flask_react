Never Again Lyrics
You better stop playin' games
I told you once before
It'll hurt you more this time
If you walk out that door

You'd better think it over (baby)
Remember what I told you (baby)
'Cause never again
(Never again, never again)
Will I love you this way
(Never again, never again)

I've learned a little more
Each time I took you back
You made a fool of me
I'll tell you where it's at

You'd better think it over (baby)
You walk out and it's over (baby)
'Cause never again
Will I love you this way
(Never again, never again)
Love can't be this way
(You cheated, you lied)
Gets worse day by day
(You cheated, you lied)
I'm sick and tired of the nights that I've been cryin'
I can't go on knowing that you're untrue

You've had your last chance now
I'm walkin' out that door
And I'm not playing games
Don't want you anymore

You'd better think it over (baby, baby)
The scar is gone forever (baby, baby)
And never again
(Never again, never again)
Will I ever love you
(Never again, never again)

Will I ever love you
(Never again, never again)
Will I ever love you
(Never again, never again)...Embed
