Right Now and Not Later Lyrics
Listen to me, baby, and listen real good
You know you're not treating me as good as you should
Every time I call you here by my side
You have some excuse and I want to know why

Right now and not later, baby
Right now and not later
'Cause later may be too late
And I gotta know right now
I mean right now and not later, baby
Right now and not later, baby

There's something wrong and it's starting to show
An' I don't wanna be the last to know
So, if there's someone else standing in our way
Then I think there's somethin' that you oughta say

Right now and not later, baby
Right now and not later
'Cause later may be too late
And I gotta know right now
I mean right now and not later, baby
Right now and not later, baby
If we can't be lovers we can still be friends
'Cause life goes on, even all love ends
But if you still want romance
Maybe I'll give you just one more chance

Right now and not later, baby
Right now and not later
'Cause later may be too late
And I gotta know right now
I mean right now and not later, baby
Right now and not later, baby

Right now and not later, baby
Right now and not later, baby
Right now and not later, baby
Right now and not later...Embed
