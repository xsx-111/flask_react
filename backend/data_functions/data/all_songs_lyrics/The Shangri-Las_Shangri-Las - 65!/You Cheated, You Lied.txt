You Cheated, You Lied LyricsYou cheated, you lied
You said that you love me
You cheated, you lied
You said that you want me
Oh, what can I do
But just keep on loving you
Love is something you know nothing about
Love is something you can't know about
So please try to love me
Love me like I love you
Oh please try to love me
Love me like I love you
You cheated, you lied
You said that you want me
You cheated, you lied
You said that you love me
Oh what can I do...
Oh what can I do...
Oh what can I do...Embed
