Out in the Streets Lyrics
(He don't hang around with the gang no more)
(He don't do the wild things that he did before)
He used to act bad
Used to, but he quit it
It makes me so sad
'Cause I know that he did it for me
(Can't you see?)
And I can see
(He's still in the street)
His heart is out in the street

(He don't comb his hair like he did before)
(He don't wear those dirty old black boots no more)
But he's not the same
There's something 'bout his kissing
That tells me he's changed
I know that something's missing inside
(Something's gone)
Something's died
(It's still in the streets)
His heart is out in the streets

He grew up on the sidewalk
Streetlights shining above
He grew up with no one to love
He grew up on the sidewalk
He grew up running free
He grew up and then he met me
(He don't hang around with the gang no more)
(And gee, he doesn't smile like he did before)
I wish I didn't care
I wish I'd never met him
They're waiting out there
I know I gotta set him free
(Send him back)
He's gotta be
(Out in the street)
His heart is out in the streets

He don't hang around with the gang no more
(Out in the streets)
He don't hang around with the gang no more
(Out in the streets)
He don't hang around with the gang no more
(Out in the streets)...1Embed
