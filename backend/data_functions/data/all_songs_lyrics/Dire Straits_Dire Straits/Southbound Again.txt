Southbound Again Lyrics
Southbound again
Don't know if I'm going or leaving home
Southbound again
Don't know if I'm going or leaving home
Boy's bound to be moving
Seems like the boy's bound to roam

Oh, every single time
I roll across the rolling river Tyne
Every single time
I roll across the rolling River Tyne
Oh, I get the same old feeling
Every time I'm moving down the line


Southbound again
Last night I felt like crying, like crying
Southbound again
Last night I felt like crying
By now I'm sick of living
But I'm gonna keep on trying, keep on trying1Embed
