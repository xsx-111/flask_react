Down to the Waterline Lyrics
Sweet surrender on the Quayside
You remember we used to run and hide
In the shadow of the cargoes
I take you one at a time
And we're counting all the numbers
Down to the waterline

Well, near misses on the dogleap stairways
French kisses in the darkened doorways
A foghorn blowing out wild and cold
A policeman, he shines a light upon my shoulder

Up comes a coaster fast and silent in the night
Over my shoulder all you can see
Are the pilot lights
No money in our jackets and our jeans are torn
Your hands are cold but your lips are warm


She can see him on the jetty that
They used to know
She can feel him in the places where
The sailors go
When she's walking by the river
Or the railway line
She can still hear him whisper
Let's go down to the waterline, c'mon2Embed
