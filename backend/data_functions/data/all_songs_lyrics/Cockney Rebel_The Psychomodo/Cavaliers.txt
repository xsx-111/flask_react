Cavaliers Lyrics
Make mine old time or I'll spit in your eye
It's better than lying, anytime
I'm horrified to step outside
Trying very hard to keep up my guard
Everything's becoming drag
We'd best get off and escape this bad, could be very sad
Misery coming over me
I'm thinking about going blind, don't want to see
Shift around this one-song town
Like a sparrow with a broken wing, feeling blue
Terrified to step outside
It's so easy to make a suicide come true
Masturbation, getting off
You can scoff, your ideals offer nothing new
I'm getting ready to run and hide
Looking for a suitable bitch to crucify

(We're all beginning to) testify, testify—it's getting fierce!
(We're all beginning to) testify, testify to be Cavaliers
Oh, how do you feel now you've testified?
Love to have God next to me
With his hands around my throat in harmony
Take away the silver tray
Fetch me water, God give me strength, I'm in pain
Seeing blow-job blues and boogaloos
Ten little niggers hooked on absinthe and daffodils
Telling tales of white gardenia
Honky-tonking all the love that's in you
(We're all beginning to) testify, testify—it's getting fierce!
(We're all beginning to) testify, testify to Cavaliers
Oh, how does it feel now you've testified?
Long-tailed coat, a silly joke
They drink like men then see them choke on Coca-Cola
Your morgue-like lips and waitress tips
And you shuffle around on your Sabrina hips
Oh make mine old time or I'll spit in your eye
It's better than lying, anytime
I'm horrified to step outside
Trying very hard to keep up my guard

(We're all beginning to) testify, testify—it's getting fierce!
(We're all beginning to) testify, testify to be Cavaliers
Oh, how does it feel now you've testified?2Embed
