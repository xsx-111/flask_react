Singular Band LyricsHarley
Thinking lots of a pretty face
When we were young, such smashing days
We'd pass the time in such a pleasant ways
Happy just to be living, oh yeah
Too many summers controlled our heads
Had not a penny, we softly tread
We fell behind but we always lead them
Listened all the, listened all the, listened all the time to a singular band
Put our resources into one Apollo
We only had to wait and follow
Then swoop around like a possessed swallow
Thinking only of winning, oh yeah
And all the time we're defending ourselves
We brushed aside all the tempting sea-shells
Charging-up like battery cells
Looking all the, looking all the, looking all the time for a singular band
You and me getting everywhere now
On the land and in the air now
Got no worries of getting there now
Consider what we're attempting, oh yeah
And now you have lots of pretty clothes
Many friends and many foes
Looking wonderful but heaven knows
Who will want us, who will want us now we're turning into a singular band ?Embed
