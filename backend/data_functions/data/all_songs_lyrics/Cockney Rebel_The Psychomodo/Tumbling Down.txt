Tumbling Down LyricsHarley
Gee, but it's hard when one lowers one's guard to the vultures
Now me, I regard it a tortuous hardship that smoulders
Like a peppermint eaten away
Will I fight ? Will I swagger or sway ?
Hee-hee, my Lady, she cries like a baby to scold us
See her tumbling down, tumbling down
Hail! to the monkey, we're having a funky reunion
Wasted and sunk, he can only have Sunday communion
He got nicotine stains in his eyes
He got nothing to protect but his pride
Oh, smother the kiss or be drownded in blissful confusion
See it tumbling down, tumbling down
Juvenile tale, see the Titanic sail into Brighton
The Hemingway stacatto, the tragic bravado can frighten
To be here, there and everywhere's fine
But do you have to be so swift all the time ?
Deliver the dawn to the Moulin Rouge on the horizon
Watch it tumbling down, tumbling down
Tumbling down, tumbling down
Oh dear, look what they've done to the blues, blues, blues
Oh dear, look what they've done to the blues, blues, blues
Oh dear, look what they've done to the blues, blues, bluesEmbed
