Sling It LyricsHarley
Well, the ship was sailing through a tempest of fear
There was lightning and explosions galore
And the waves came whooshing and crashing and, boy
It was panic as we swam for the shore
There were ladies and babies being trampled to hell
Where the flames flickered happy and sad
And the honey-coloured moon it was bouncing around
He was laughing, saying : 'Dear, this is mad'
Oh, come on! Sling it! Sling it!
Let's sling it and do it again!
Then a message flashed in the sky by the sun :


Oh, the fear in our hearts was diminished at once
We began to restore love and peace
And though the ship had gone down, there was a moral to be found
'If this is life, then it's hard to believe!'
Oh, come on! Sling it! Sling it!
Let's sling it and do it again!
Oh, come on! Sling it! Sling it!
Let's sling it and do it again!Embed
