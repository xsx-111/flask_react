Ritz LyricsHark to Roualt's white insanity
Clowns in drag concealing vanity
This is hardly Paradise
We're still in search of petty scorn
Images so dead, in mourning
Clap and cheer the man performing
This is hardly Paradise
We're still in search of petty scorn
Couch my disease in chintz-covered kisses
Glazed calico cloth, my costume this is
Come to Pablo Fanque's in Indigo
We'll show you pastel shades of rhyme
It's okay to laugh in harmony
See the white-faced Auguste's army
Come to Pablo Fanque's in Indigo
We'll show you pastel shades of rhyme
Take a letter Ophelia, write
'Sorry Desdemona', bright
Peeking through the Nimbus covers
We see the twisted tale of Man
Catch us in the cornfield hiding
Me, Maryse and moonbeams gliding
Peeking through the Nimbus covers
We see the twisted tale of Man
Careless, caress, curl up beside me
Visit, sleep and smile and drown me
Go march together, slay like Nero
Till we show something you understand
Oh, the clown, his stare is happiness
Will he make you laugh or cry, yes
Go march together, slay like Nero
Till we show something you understand
Is it time to hide my body ?
Shall we start to speak of holly ?
I don't wanna be that Super-hero
'Til you have something we understand
Heard they're moving Pisces into June
Shall we put together a platoon ?
I don't wanna be that Super-hero
'Til you have something we understandEmbed
