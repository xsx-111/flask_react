Arrival Lyrics
That must be it

Through the summer rain of 1845
The coach had finally arrived
To the valley where the crossroads meet below
And where all darkness seems to grow
People blame it on the hill
The hill where no one dares to go (The mansion)
Where no one dares to go

The coach had stopped
And from the window you could see
Seven horsemen in the night
Miriam Natias and Jonathan Lafey
Saw the magic in their eyes
They were in for a surprise
The darkness would soon be complete
A horseman came forth from the dark

"We know you've come to inherit what's yours
(The mansion)
Take our advice and go back on this night
If you refuse eighteen will become nine"
Eighteen is nine
Eighteen is nine

Jonathan laughed and said, "Get out of my way"
"I don't believe a word you say"
The seven horsemen disappeared into the night
"Someday you'll need our help my friend"
I think poor Jonathan was scared
Eighteen is actually nine
It stuck in his mindEmbed
