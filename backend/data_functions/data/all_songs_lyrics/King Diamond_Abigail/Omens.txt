Omens LyricsNobody's inside the church, but the bell is ringing
For no reason, the flowers are dying
Oh, deadly Omens!
Oh, deadly Omens!
Inside the mansion, the air is unbearable -- a rotten smell
In the dining room, the table is set for three
Oh, deadly Omens!
Oh, deadly Omens!
"Miriam, come here and see what I've found. It's moving!
An empty cradle swaying in the air!
I did not bring it in here! Did you?!"
"No, no, no!"
Oh, deadly Omens!
Oh, deadly OmensEmbed
