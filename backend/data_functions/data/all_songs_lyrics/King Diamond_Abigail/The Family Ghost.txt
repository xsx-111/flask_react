The Family Ghost LyricsThe darkness came closer to home on the following night
And Miriam slept like a rock when Jonathan's face went white...
The bedroom was ice cold
But the fire was burning still
The blinding light!
The family ghost had risen again...the ghost!
"Don't be scared. Don't be scared now, my friend
I am Count de la Fey
Let me take you to the crypt down below
Where Abigail rests....
Let Miriam sleep
She never would understand
Now come let us go
It's time to know..."
"Beware of the slippery stairs
You could easily fall and break your neck!
Hand me that torch and I will lead the way
To the secret in the dark
Take a look into the vault...."
The sarcophagus of a child!
"Abigail has been in here for years and years . . . stillborn."
"The spirit of Abigail is inside your wife
And there's only one way you can stop the rebirth of evil itself:
You must take her life now!"Embed
