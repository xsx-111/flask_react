The 7th Day Of July 1777 Lyrics

Count de LaFey uncovered his cheating wife
9 months of loving and sharing
Oh it was a bastard child
How could he have been so blind?!
"No bastard baby
Will inherit what's mine"
Another one of her affairs
Had left him in despair

So he pushed her down the stairs, to die
"No" she cried
In 1777
On the 7th Day of July

The Countess broke her neck
And the embryo came out dead
Then he burned his beloved wife
And the embryo he gave a name
"Abigail, you must rest in shame"
Rest in shame

Obsessed
With a strange idea
He wanted to mummify
The girl for the future to find
And he did


So he pushed her down the stairs, to die
"No" she cried
In 1777
On the 7th Day of JulyEmbed
