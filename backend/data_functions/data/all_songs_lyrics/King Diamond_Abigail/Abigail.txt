Abigail Lyrics
"Abigail! I know you're in control of her brain, Abigail!
And I know that you're the one that's speaking through her
Abigail!
Miriam, can you hear me??"
"I am alive inside your wife
Miriam's dead. I am her head...."
"Abigail! Don't you think I know what you've done, Abigail?!
I'll get a priest! He will know how to get her soul back!"
"Oh, Jonathan! This is Miriam!
Our time is out!

Remember the stairs! It's the only way!"
"Abigail! Nothing I can do but give in, Abigail...."
"Jonathan, I agree.... Yes I do...."
"I am alive inside your wife
Miriam's dead. I am her head....
Soon I'll be free!!!"2Embed
