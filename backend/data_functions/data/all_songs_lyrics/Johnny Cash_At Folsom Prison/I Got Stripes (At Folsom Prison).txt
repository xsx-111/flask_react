I Got Stripes (At Folsom Prison) LyricsOn a Monday I was arrested (Uh-huh)
On a Tuesday they locked me in the jail (Oh boy)
On a Wednesday, my trial was attested
On a Thursday, they said guilty and the judge's gavel fell

I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains, they're about to drag me down

On a Monday, my mama come to see me
On a Tuesday, they caught me with a file
On a Wednesday, I'm down in solitary
On a Thursday, I start on bread and water for a while

I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripеs around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains, thеy're about to drag me down

I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains, they're about to drag me down
"Hey, this microphone's got a screw loose here. Somebody come screw this microphone? (Laughs) What'd I say? Just a minute, let me fix this. Alright..."Embed
