The Long Black Veil (At Folsom Prison) LyricsTen years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall lights
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
The judge said, son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spokе not a word, though it meant by life
I'd been in the arms of my bеst friend's wife
(Laughter) Did I hear somebody applaud?
Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near
She stood in the crowd and she shed not a tear
But sometimes at night, when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
"Can I have a glass of water? Huh? Alright? Let me have a drink of water, I'm about to choke up. That cocaine blues. We got a special surprise for you fellas, especially for one fella in a few minutes. We're going to record a brand new song that I just sang last night for the very first time. It was written by someone here in Folsom Prison. Can I get a drink of water? Last time I was here, I had a drink of water. And I don't know what the hell it run off of. I think it must have run off of Luther's boots or something. Is that water? You promise that's water, huh? Is that water, Bob? (Coughs) That's water. They serve everything in tin cups? (Laughs) You caught it, didn't you?"
"I have an announcement here. Sandoval- Sandoval... S-A-N-D-O-V-A-L, Sandoval. 88419 is wanted in reception."Embed
