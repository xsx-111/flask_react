25 Minutes to Go (At Folsom Prison) LyricsWell, they're building a gallows outside my cell
And I've got 25 minutes to go
And the whole town's waiting just to hear me yell
I got 24 minutes to go
Well, they gave me some beans for my last meal
With 23 minutes to go
But nobody asked me how I feel
I got 22 minutes to go
Well, I sent for the governor and the whole durn bunch
With 21 minutes to go
And I called up the mayor but he's out to lunch
I got 20 more minutes to go
Then the sheriff said boy, I'm gonna watch you die
With 19 minutes to go
So I laughed in his face and I spit in his eye
With 18 minutes to go
Now here comes the preacher for to save my soul
With 13 minutes to go
And he's talking about burning but I'm so cold
12 more minutes to go
Well, they're testing the trap and it chills my spine
11 more minutes to go
And the trap and the rope, aw, they work just fine
10 more minutes to go
Well, I'm waiting for the pardon that'll set me free
With 9 more minutes to go
But this ain't the movies, so forget about me!
8 more minutes to go
With my feet on a trap and my head in the noose
5 more minutes to go
Won't somebody come and cut me loose?
7 more minutes to go
I can see the mountains, I can see the sky
With 3 more minutes to go
And it's too durn pretty for a man to wanna die
2 more minutes to go
I can see the buzzards, I can hear the crows
1 more minute to go
And now I'm swinging and here I go-whoa-whoa-whoa...

"Thank you very much. I want to do another song here featuring the harmonic-y. Then I want to get the stool there and sit down and do some, uh, slow ballad type songs that we wanted to do for this album, and especially for you. What did I do with my list over there? My idiot sheet. It hit the floor, didn't it? Excuse me. How you doing, Shirley?"Embed
