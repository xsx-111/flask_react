Orange Blossom Special (At Folsom Prison) LyricsHey, look yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back
"Have to change harmonicas faster than kiss a duck!"
Going down to Florida
Get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californ-ee
And get some sand in my shoes
Ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues
"Hey man, when you goin' back to Florida?
Say, I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever go back to Florida
But ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?
Well, I don't care if I do die, do die, do die, do die, do die..."
Hey, talk about ramblin'
She's the fastеst train on the line
Hey, talk about travеlin'
She's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard lineEmbed
