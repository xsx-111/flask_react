Jackson (At Folsom Prison) Lyrics"Hey, will you sing a song with me?"
"I'd be very pleased to sing a song with you!"
"You sure look nice!"
"Thank you, I'm glad to be back in Folsom!"
"Oh, I like - (laughs) I like to watch you talk."
"I'm talkin' with my mouth! (Laughs) Up here!"
We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson
Ever since the fire went out
I'm going to Jackson
I'm gonna mess around
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out Jackson town
Well, go on down to Jackson
Go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand, you big-talkin' man
Make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson
Go comb your hair
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson
See if I care
Well, when I breeze into that city
People gonna stoop and bow
All them women gonna make me
Teach 'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson
You turn loose my coat
'Cause I'm goin' to Jackson
Goodbye, that's all she wrote
But they'll laugh at you in Jackson
And I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you 'round town like a scolded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, I'll go to Jackson
You big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson
Behind my Japan Fan
Well now, we got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson
Ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson
And that's a fact
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson
Ain't never comin' back
Well, we got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
"How much time we got? About fifteen minutes?"Embed
