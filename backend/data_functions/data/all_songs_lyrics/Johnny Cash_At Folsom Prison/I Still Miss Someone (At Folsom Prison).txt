I Still Miss Someone (At Folsom Prison) Lyrics"They'll probably take that word out of it..."
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
'Cause I still miss someone
I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was theirs
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someoneEmbed
