Like Fleas Lyrics
They say Mother Earth is dying
I don't see it quite that way
As she spits out massive hurricanes
To wash us all away

And as she starts to tire
Of parasitic man
She’ll rattle up some earthquakes
To grind us into sand
And when the magma flows
Across the terra floor
She'll orbit gently laughing
'Til we are all no more, ’til we are all no more

Like fleas on the back of a dog
(Fleas on the back of a dog)
Eventually we'll be shaken off
(Ah, shaken off)
Like fleas on the back of a dog
(Fleas on the back of a dog)
Eventually we'll be shaken off
(Ah, shaken off)

Like fleas on the back of a dog
(Fleas on the back of a dog)
Eventually we'll be shaken off
(Ah, shaken off)
Like fleas on the back of a dog
(Fleas on the back of a dog)
Eventually we'll be shaken off
(Ah, shaken off)
Like fleas on the back of a dog
(Fleas on the back of a dog)
Eventually we'll be shaken off
(Ah, shaken off)

They say Mother Earth is dying
I don't see it quite that way
As she spits out massive hurricanes
To wash us all away
