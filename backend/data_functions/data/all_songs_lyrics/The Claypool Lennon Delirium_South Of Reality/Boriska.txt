Boriska Lyrics
Will he understand us?

Boriska did it all for his mother
He just wanted to please her desperately
Boriska could never disappoint her
He told her what she wanted to believe
This alien pilot and indigo child
Sent from the Red Planet so he'd understand it
Will he understand it?

Boriska never breaks under pressure
His words are all measured strategically
Boriska is indeed very clever
To make such interstellar fantasies
What befell Atlantis
He says soon will happen to us if we fall off
The cosmic bandwagon
This alien pilot and indigo child
Sent from the land of dust, so they'd understand us
Will they understand us?

Please understand us


Will he understand us?Embed
