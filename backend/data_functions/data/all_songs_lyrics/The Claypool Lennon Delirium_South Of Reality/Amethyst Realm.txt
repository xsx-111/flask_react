Amethyst Realm Lyrics
She turned the light on suddenly, but as she looked saw nobody
Though on her neck she felt his breath, a tingling upon her breast
She called out to the empty room, "Whoever's there, I'm onto you"
When the impossible happened, her very first phantgasm

Said "Why me?", said "Why me?", said "Why me?"
How could some apparition take my woman?
Think I see, think I see, think I see
A shadow in her window

The game she played was dangerous
This kind of love is vaporous
She could sense when he was there
A fragrance upon the air
And though there were so many things
The two of them would never share
She swore that she'd never again
Want to touch a living man

Said "Why me?", said "Why me?", said "Why me?"
How could some apparition take my woman?
Think I see, think I see, think I see
A shadow in her window
And I will meet you in hell, Amethyst Realm
I can't compete with the supernatural
You gave it all to the devil, Amethyst Realm
How could you fall under his spell?
Amethyst Realm


And I will meet you in hell, Amethyst Realm
I can't compete with the supernatural
You gave it all to the devil, Amethyst Realm
How could you fall under his spell?
Amethyst Realm


And I will meet you in hell, Amethyst Realm
I can't compete with the supernatural
You gave it all to the devil, Amethyst Realm
How could you fall under his spell?
