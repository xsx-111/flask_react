South of Reality (Path of Totality) Lyrics
Lafawnduh's going to take us to the place
Where we can stand and stare out into space
Cardboard goggles propped before our eyes
Sunburned faces gazing to the skies
Pops says it's like watching drying paint
We're impressed but obviously he ain't
Not really his idea of fun
Waiting for the moon to shield the sun

South of the path
Of totality
South of the path
Of totality

When Shiner was just a mini boy
His science teacher thought he might enjoy
A shadowbox of empty Captain Crunch
So he could watch the eclipse after lunch
Standing out on the Snake Canyon rim
He's staring up and she's staring at him
Wondering where his mind has run
Waiting for the moon to shield the sun
South of the path
Of totality
South of the path
Of totality


It's getting dimmer, a chill is in the air
Baffled flies are buzzing everywhere
Armed with his plastic swatter sword
Pops battles so he won't be bored
The Cheshire Cat dodges behind the moon
An eerie haze glooms the afternoon
Lafawnduh's primed and ready for her run
As the moon chases away the sun

South of the path
Of totalityEmbed
