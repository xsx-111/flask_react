Blood and Rockets: Movement I, Saga of Jack Parsons - Movement II, Too the Moon Lyrics
T-minus 15 seconds, guidance is internal
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine
Ignition sequence start
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero
All engines running
Lift off

Because he started with experiments in the backyard, Jack Parsons
As a little boy he already went a bit too far
But the trouble really started when he found another young arsonist
Because together they were ready to reach the stars (Reach the stars)
So the two of them began to play around with various explosives
Jack had stolen from the local powder company (Company)
The military gathering a bevy of young rocket scientists
Thought the boys would do what no one else had achieved

How high (How high)
Does your rocket fly? (Does your rocket fly?)
You better be careful boys
You just might (You just might)
Set the world on fire (On fire)
You better be careful boys
You'll set the world on fire
So Jack became a loyal follower of Mr. Aleister Crowley
He took an oath to be a Magister Templi
His pretty house in Pasadena was notorious for the orgies
Every night were Eleusinian Mysteries (Mysteries)
When his company became the famous JP Laboratories
His reputation made it difficult to proceed (Difficult to proceed)
And after one of his alchemical magical ceremonies
They found his body in an pile of blood and debris

How high (How high)
Does your rocket fly? (Does your rocket fly?)
You better be careful boys
You just might (You just might)
Set the world on fire (On fire)
You better be careful boys
You'll set the world on fire


How high (How high)
Does your rocket fly? (Does your rocket fly?)
You better be careful boys
You just might (You just might)
Set the world on fire (On fire)
You better be careful boys
You better be careful
You'll set the world on fire

Do what thou wilt
(Do what thou wilt
Do what thou wilt
Do what thou wilt)
Love is the law
(Love is the law
Love is the law
Love is the law)
Do what thy will
(Do what thy will
Do what thy will
Do what thy will)
Fly me to the moon
(Fly me to the moon
Fly me to the moon
Fly me to the moon)5Embed
