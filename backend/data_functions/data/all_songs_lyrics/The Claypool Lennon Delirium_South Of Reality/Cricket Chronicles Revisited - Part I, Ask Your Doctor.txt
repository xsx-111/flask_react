Cricket Chronicles Revisited - Part I, Ask Your Doctor Lyrics
Are you desensitized, sleepwalking through life?
(Don't concern yourself, these are just side effects)
Things you once enjoyed do not feel quite right?
(Don't concern yourself, these are just side effects)
In the mirror you barely recognize
(Don't concern yourself, these are just side effects)
Someone masquerading as your lovely wife?

Ask your doctor
Ask your doctor

Is your throat just a little bit too dry?
(Don't concern yourself, these are just side effects)
Trouble looking anyone in the eye?
(Don't concern yourself, these are just side effects)
Evil things are becoming normal life?
(Don't concern yourself, these are just side effects)
Trouble remembering how to empathize?
