Hey Grandma LyricsHey Grandma, you're so young
Your old man's just a boy
Been a long time this time (pow-pow-pow)
Been a long time this time (pow-pow-pow)
Been a long time this time round, this time round
Everything is upside down, upside down
Sure looking good
You're looking so good
You're sure looking good
SF freak scene was on my mind
Fillmore Slim is just a-wasting time
Well I got high this time (pow-pow-pow)
Well I got high this time (pow-pow-pow)
Well I got high this time round, this time round
Everything is upside down, upside down
Cause your looking good
You're looking so good
You're sure looking good
Robitussin make me feel so fine
Robitussin and Elderberry wine
Hey Grandma
Hey Grandma
Hey Grandma
