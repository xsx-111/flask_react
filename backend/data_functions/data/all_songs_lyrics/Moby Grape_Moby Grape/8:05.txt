8:05 Lyrics
Eight-oh-five
I guess you're leaving soon
I can't go on without you
It's useless to try
To love you would be so good
To keep you would be so wonderful
Here is my heart that I give
It's all that I have

Please change your mind
Before my sunshine is gone
Do you think you could try
Do you think you could try
Do you think you could try?


Please understand how I feel
Until I can prove it to you
Don't fill my world with rain
You know your tears will only bring pain in my heart
Eight-oh-five
I guess you're leaving, goodbye1Embed
