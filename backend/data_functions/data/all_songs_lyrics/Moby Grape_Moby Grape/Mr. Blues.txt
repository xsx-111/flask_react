Mr. Blues LyricsWhere's that old Mr. Blues?
I guess he found a new home
Pushing more trouble right down to the bone
I'm wondering why he's left me alone
Where's that old Mr. Blues?
I guess he's stepping on through (now)
Pushing down places, all down and abused
Picking on people with nothing to lose
I want you, people
Cause, somewhere you find out
Inside and outside (baby)
Nothing to hide now
So come on in, let me tell ya the news
Cause I'm not afraid of you, Mr. Blues
Where's that old Mr. Blues?
I guess he's gone away now
He's never been bothered with being unkind
Listen here people, I've left him behind
Cause if you ever, ever should lose
You better come
Got to, put down old Mr. Blues (let me tell ya)
Got to put blues down on the table
Got to let the blues go down
Down my throat now
(Talking trash!)Embed
