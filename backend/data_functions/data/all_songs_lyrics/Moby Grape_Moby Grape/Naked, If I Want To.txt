Naked, If I Want To LyricsWould you let me walk down your street
Naked if I want to
Can I pop fireworks on the fourth of every single july
Can I buy an amplifier, oh, on time
My sweet time
Well I ain't got no money
I will pay this time
And I ain't got no money
But I will pay you before I die
And would you let me walk down your street
Naked if I want to
Can I pop fireworks on the fourth of every single july
Can I buy an aeroplane while I'm high in all the sky
And I got no mercy
I will pay this time
And I got no mercy
I will pay you before I dieEmbed
