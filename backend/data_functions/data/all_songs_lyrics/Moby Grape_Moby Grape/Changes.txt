Changes LyricsChanges! (Changes!)
Changes! (Changes!)
I'm sure the cure is not there
Anywhere to be found
Changes! (Changes!)
Changes! (Changes!)
Rearranging things to bring me down
People fill the air
Everywhere, with their changes
Everyday, every way, I found!
I try to sympathize with their problems
But my changin' self
Won't keep up with nobody else
Here today, gone away
Friends we knew, places too
Alright now, everybody changes
Changes! (Changes!)
Changes! (Changes!)
I'm sure the cure is not there
Anywhere to be found
Changes! (Changes!)
Changes! (Changes!)
Rearranging things to bring me down
People fill the air
Everywhere, with their changes
Everyday, every way, I found!
I try to sympathize with their problems
But my changin' self
Won't keep up with nobody else
Here today, gone away
Friends we knew, places too
Alright now, everybody changes
Everybody changes
But the weather's fine
Everybody changes...Embed
