Indifference LyricsWhat a difference a day has made
What a difference a day has made
What a difference and more of the same
What's that song you're singing?
Just a bell ringing in my mind
What's that tune you're bringing?
Just part of what there is to find
What a difference a day has made
What a difference a day has made
What a difference and more of the same
What's this deeper here?
Something that you've always been
Is it you I've finally found?
Brought you up, now brings you down
What a difference a day has made
What a difference a day has made
What a difference and more of the same
What's this song you're bringing?
Just a bell ringing in my mind
Is it forever ever?
That's the part that blows my mind
What a difference and more of the same...
Just one thing I got to say
Try some today, now, baby
Try some nowEmbed
