Lazy Me LyricsWhat is this feeling my heart gets when I see you smile?
And why can't I say to you "Come with me just for a while"?
I guess I'll never know why
I'll just lay here and decay here
What is the answer God's children look for in my mind?
And who are the father's of lost lovers drifting through time?
I guess I'll never know why
I'll just lay here and decay here
Who holds the blank thoughts of people when nothing is said?
And who turns the lights out after you've gotten in bed?
I guess I'll never know why
I'll just lay here and decay hereEmbed
