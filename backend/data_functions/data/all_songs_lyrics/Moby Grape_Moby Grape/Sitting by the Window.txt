Sitting by the Window LyricsI was sitting by the window
Watchin' for the rain
The reflection of your picture
Against my window pane
But just the same
I'm playin' my game
And I guess you're playin' it too
Go ahead and play it on through
The times we had together
It was sunny every day
Now it's cloudy every morning
And it stays that way all day
But just the same
I'm playin' my game
And I guess you're playin' it too
Go ahead and play it on through
I was sitting by the window
Watchin' for the rain
I thought you were beside me
Just like before the rain
But just the same
I'm playin' my game
And I guess you're playin' it too
Go ahead and play it on throughEmbed
