Someday LyricsSomeday
Tomorrow will come
Though I'm not afraid of today
That's for sure
You laughed at me
For the last time
You've got to understand
It just wasn't in the plan
To me, your life was ended
When I said goodbye to you
Ah ha ha, you laughed at me
For the last time
Now there's nothing left
Tired of playing games
Your mind is lost
In a world that wasn't made for you
Though I feel the same way, too
I still got some things to doEmbed
