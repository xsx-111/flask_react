Piggy Bank Lies LyricsFind these answers
From the words that
You already, you already said
Never thought I
Would find out
But we're here now
Waiting for it
Waiting for it
You said you'd never been with anyone else but you lied
As you try say somehow that I was the one to blame
Is this the way you felt for saving yourself (if lies were wealth)
You need help, counting riches form your mouth's piggy bank
I drove these streets to your front door
So could you please just help me out?
It's sad to say but there's always more
And you just stare like you can't hear us out
Find the suspect
Find the suspect
Find the suspect
Find the suspect
This is where you say this is not what it looks like
He's got his hands wrapped around your waist
I want this, do you want it?
I hate this, but you flaunt it
It sounds absurd, so I waited for my own eyes
To put a face on the person that built these lies
Did you want this? 'Cause I want it
Could have fooled me, cause I bought it
(You have been found out)
I told myself it was the jealousy that caught my distrust
But I'm such a good pretender I still rendered my doubts
Of all the liars number one is where you made your debut
But I'll teach you the truth, because I've figured you out
I drove these streets to your front door
So could you please just help me out?
It's sad to say but there's always more
And you just stare like you can't hear a sound
Find the suspect
Find the suspect
Find the suspect
Find the suspect
I've finally figured you out
I've finally figured you out
This is where you say this is not what it looks like
He's got his hands wrapped around your waist
I want this, do you want it?
I hate this, but you flaunt it
It sounds absurd, so I waited for my own eyes
To put a face on the person that built these lies
Did you want this? 'Cause I want it
Could have fooled me, cause I bought it
Trying to forget (I should have been careful)
Wishing we never met (but still faithful)
I should have been careful (I should have been careful)
I thought I was unbreakable
But sometimes, you find out (I should have been careful)
That you can not control your heart (but still faithful)
Or regain the person that you were from the start (I should have been careful)
Find the suspect
Find the suspect
Find the suspect
Find the suspect
This is where you say this is not what it looks like

I want this, do you want it?
I hate this, but you flaunt it

Did you want this? 'Cause I want it
