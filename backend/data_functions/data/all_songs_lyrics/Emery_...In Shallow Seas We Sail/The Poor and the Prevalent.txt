The Poor and the Prevalent LyricsI've got to put a stop to all this
(I've seen this, I tasted)
To all this being separated and then cut off
(I've seen this)
I've got to put a stop to all this
(Separated then fall)
I've got to put a stop to all this
To all this being separated and then cut off
(Separated then, then fall, then fall)
I've got to put a stop to all this
We could float
Over the world and decide for ourselves
If we will ever return
If only our dreams
Were fires to ignite
Then we could let
The whole world burn
You said this was over (Save us) when
You suffocate the truth and trade for nothing
The kisses and the distances
Are clinging to my weaknesses
(Save us) Somebody help me here
'cause I can't steer the wrong words away
A killer to my worries
And then caught me without my defense
There's a death inside
And it's yours and mine
So count up your identities
Invented for the frequencies of need
Does it depend
On circumstance or excuse
My inheritance of the abuse
The importance of new
My choice of the two
The truth is that I choose you
You said this was over (Save us) when
You suffocate the truth and trade for nothing
The kisses and the distances
Are clinging to my weaknesses
(Save us) Somebody help me here
'cause I can't steer the wrong words away
A killer to my worries
And then caught me without my defense
There's a death inside
And it's yours and mine
So count up your identities
Invented for the frequencies of need
I've got to put a stop to all this
(I've seen this, I tasted)
To all this being separated and then cut off
I've got to put a stop to all this
(I've seen this, I tasted)
To all this being separated and then cut off
Cut off, cut off
I'm crushed, broken, begging for this
Outside of you, but this severance?
Torn from my hands, I still taste it
Torn from my hands with my consent
(Cowards and princes
Can sometimes look the same
Just blink and they change
They change, I've changed
We've changed too)
You said this was over when
You suffocate the truth and trade for nothing
The kisses and the distances
Are clinging to my weaknesses
(Save us) Somebody help me here
'cause I can't steer the wrong words away
A killer to my worries
And then caught me without my defense
There's a death inside
And it's yours and mine
So count up your identities
Invented for the frequencies of needEmbed
