Dear Death Part 2 LyricsTime is running out
As you die die die
In this bed not making a sound
It has all come crashing down
To be here and watch you breathe your last
So helpless to stop you from slipping away so fast
Oh God are you listening now
As this cancer dances through her and then takes a bow
It won't disappoint the crowd
Whose words are a curse
As I hear them one by one
Each pull, the string, and I come undone
I know this, I failed to say
(I'm sinking by your side)
You're worth this, I wouldn't trade a day
To not have gone though this
So many days I've been blind
I want to stop and rewind
Kick off our shoes and dance
With the ghost of you
Who could tease me
And leave me begging for the abuse
You're the only one I knew
That could tame me and make me who I am
But now, it's all fading
And there's nothing left of all my plans
I know this, I failed to say
(I'm sinking by your side)
You're worth this, I wouldn't trade a day
To not have gone though this
So many days I've been blind
I want to stop and rewind
Kick off our shoes and dance
Let's dance again
We'll turn up our sleeves
I know just where to begin
Dance, let's dance again
We could find ourselves before this happened
These words of mine are trite and so clich√©
And still they find their place in everything
It's just to break the silence that has been crushing me
Half of me is dead, already gone
And half is screaming everyone is wrong
I'm finally asking now will you
Just hear me out
This was all my fault
Now you've brought me death
And it's everything I wanted
It's the wrong side of fear that kept me outEmbed
