Inside Our Skin LyricsThis is what comes of the best intentions we have
They get lost with the rest and soon forgotten
And the money we spend is
To make amends for the time that we've never
To make amends for the time that we've never given
We all feel real inside our skin
With selfish hearts that hide our sin
But everyone that runs a race can't win
We all feel real inside our skin
If God is good, then what are we?
There is no plant without a seed
When morning comes, will we all believe
That was lost can be retrieved
You say you're good, then let me see
A faith is dead without the deed
How can we fail if we believe?
Let's be who we were meant to be
We all feel real inside our skin
With selfish hearts that hide our sin
But no one really knows our deepest secrets
We will separate ourselves from everyone that we know (We say, we're so misunderstood,)
We can't allow a single doubt or weakness to show (But I know we don't do the things we should)
Just one more day without the shame and I can move on (So long to what I thought was)
I'll be happier, happier when I've (I'll be happier, happier when I've)
We will separate ourselves from everyone that we know (We say, we're so misunderstood,)
We can't allow a single doubt or weakness to show (But I know we don't do the things we should)
Just one more day without the shame and I can move on (So long to what I thought was)
I'll be happier, happier when I've given up (I'll be happier, happier when I've given up)
Wisdom light my way into the dark
Your words, the melody that carries me
We can't make a change 'til we know who we are
What burns?
The fire refining me
Wisdom light my way into the dark
We can't make a change 'til we know who we are
The fire refining me
Refining meEmbed
