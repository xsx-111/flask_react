Churches & Serial Killers Lyrics
There is a part of me that always sees the easy way out
If it doesn't hurt then not another word
You keep the reasons all but hidden, it feels like we will drown
Do I hold on when it's so far gone?

To recall all the footsteps in the hall, with our loose lips
Chemicals in the bloodstream, start the surgery
Take care not to hurt me
Send the signal, send the signal
Send the signal, send the signal
There is a part of me that always sees the easy way out
(Is this the easy way we were?)
If it doesn't hurt then not another word
(Then take me back inside)
You keep the reasons all but hidden
(Is this the easy way we were?)
It feels like we will drown
Do I hold on, when it's so far gone?
Brush the skin, blood involved, lose the voice
She rejoices if I'm all alone
Beauty takes more than anything
But I can't stop what's inside of me
Send the signal, send the signal
Send the signal, send the signal
There is a part of me that always sees the easy way out
(Is this the easy way we were?)
If it doesn't hurt then not another word
(Then take me back inside)
You keep the reasons all but hidden
(Is this the easy way we were?)
It feels like we will drown
Do I hold on, when it's so far gone?

Is there a chance, just a chance that you need me?
Or are we better off thinking that in this dance the romance is a secret?
But I'm not quite sure I believe it
With my eyes, with my words slowly rise and fall
(Catch me, I'm slipping through)
Slowly rise and fall
(Catch me, I'm slipping through)
Slowly rise and fall
(Catch me, I'm slipping through your fingers)Embed
