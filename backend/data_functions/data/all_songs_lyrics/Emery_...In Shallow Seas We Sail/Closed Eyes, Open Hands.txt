Closed Eyes, Open Hands LyricsWe can make believe
We're happy and free
It's automatic when
The money is in our hands
People always try
To look beyond their own lives
But, I know that It won't last
Pride comes before our fellow man
Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
It's a perfect day
For us to make a change
Forget about the watered down
Mistakes that we have made
And there's a way
To clear our tainted names
Just look ahead and don't be scared
We've got so many choices to make
Take a look around (Just look around)
Where is your hope found (Where is it found)
Is it the ones you love
Or just your bank account?
(We all want to be
The people we should never be
We're trying things we just don't need
It's a perfect day
For us to make a change
Forget about the watered down
Mistakes that we have made
And there's a way
To clear our tainted names
Just look ahead and don't be scared
We got so many choices to make
Paint the things we don't need
To impress those we don't know
Indebted to our own accessories
We hide behind our own lies
But the fake dreams, it can't be
The only thing we have worth living for
It's a perfect day
For us to make a change
Forget about the watered down
Mistakes that we have made
Morning breaks
Into a brand new day
So look ahead and don't be scared
We've got so many choices to makeEmbed
