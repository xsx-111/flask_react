Dear Death Part 1 LyricsJust hear me out
This was all my fault
Now you've brought me death
And it's everything I wanted
It's the wrong side of fear that kept me out
It's the wrong inside that fills my mouth
Has left me without
In this darkness I've given my ground
But know this night will be mine
But know this night will be mine
Will be mine...
Esta noche será mía
Esta noche será mía
Esta noche será mía
Esta noche será míaEmbed
