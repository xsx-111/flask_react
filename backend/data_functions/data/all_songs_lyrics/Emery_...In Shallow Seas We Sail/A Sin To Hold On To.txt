A Sin To Hold On To LyricsWhen I saw you walking by, I could not believe my eyes
Underneath the city lights, reflecting all your curves just right
Can I have your attention for a moment?
I just need to say something
If you've got the time, then I've got the reason for the sin
If you've got the time, then I've got the reason for the sin
Have you been been looking out?
Have you been watching my back?
My patience is running out and I
Can't seem to stay on the right track
Your wanting eyes
Keep me coming back for more and more each time
Let's get this right
Cause there is no second chance after tonight
No chance after tonight
I know you've got it in you, won't you let it out (let it out)?
Dig a little deeper and I know you'll find strength inside
If we could be the ones to hold on (to stay strong)
Then maybe we could make a difference in somebody's life (in somebody)
I won't be part of the riot
I won't be part of the revolution
You think you're keeping us quiet
We're not the problem, but we are the solution
I won't be part of the riot
I won't be part of the revolution
You think you're keeping us quiet
We're not the problem, but we are the solution
Let's get this right, cause there are no second chances
I know you've got it in you, won't you let it out (let it out)?
Dig a little deeper and I know you'll find strength inside
If we could be the ones to hold on (to stay strong)
Then maybe we could make a difference in somebody's life (in somebody)
I know you've got it in you, won't you let it out (let it out)?
Dig a little deeper and I know you'll find strength inside
If we could be the ones to hold on (to stay strong)
Then maybe we could make a difference in somebody's life (in somebody)1Embed
