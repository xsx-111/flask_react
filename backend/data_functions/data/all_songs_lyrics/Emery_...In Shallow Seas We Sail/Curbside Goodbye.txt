Curbside Goodbye LyricsYou've buried me here
And I can't turn off my eyes, only sinking
You've hidden the keys to sleep
The sweet careful lines we've crossed
And now we never can go back
This is what I felt, just being myself
But I know that you wouldn't stay
Standing at my car with my reasons spent
As you drove and made your escape
The silence crushing me, like I swore it would
And I'm left watching...
Red lights fading out
(I refuse to accept these excuses you're making)
As you drive back to your house
(To save yourself from taking blame the only reason that you came at all)
I'm here sinking and now we never can go back
I chose every word that I knew would hurt but that was a poor choice at best
This weak disguise, your careless replies that you made at my expense
You swore this was right
It was better that you're leaving but I'm here with...
Red lights fading out
(I refuse to accept these excuses you're making)
As you drive back to your house
(To save yourself from taking blame the only reason that you came at all)
And I'm here with my curbside goodbye
This sting in my eyes won't leave me tonight
As I stay awake to watch the day start without you
I'm here sinking, now we can never go back
My foundation crippled and cracked
Broken, severed, bleed out the hurt
Two people dissolve into words
Red lights fading out
As you drive back to your house
The way I've gone a hundred times
Before but now I'm left behind
So make all of this make sense
And now your voice is haunting me
Just out of reach it buries me
Is this the better off that you meant
The way I've gone a hundred times
Before but now I'm left behind
So make all of this make sense
And now your voice is haunting me
Just out of reach it buries me
It buries me, it buries me, it buries me, it buries meEmbed
