The Smile, The Face LyricsI was never going to fall
(I was never going to fall)
But the smile, the face has sealed my fate
(The smile, the face)
So sweet, an addict of it all
(I was an addict of it all)
I was blind for another taste
(I have nothing left to give
These veins are dry you've drained me dry)
The world, has turned, black and cold
And I, can't catch my breath
You rehearsed your lines
With rhythmic details
They match, the pounding in my chest
Then summer came, and you left me with your words
The clever sounds from your mouth
They can make me feel so worthless
And you say, that I am not enough
But though my heart is breaking open
Know that I will not be broken (for you)
The person you claimed to be, is not who haunts me now
The careless lies behind those brown eyes
That you swore were true more times than I can count
Then summer came, and you left me with your words
The clever sounds from your mouth
They can make me feel so worthless
And you say, that I am not enough
But though my heart is breaking open
Know that I will not be broken
I know these words are weak and young
But spoken as I come undone
And while I drown in these mistakes
You ego swells but I can tell
You know that you're a fake
(You cried in front of your friends)
Just to save some face
(You didn't want it to end)
In just a week I'm replaced
(You wanted me so listen, listen to me)
But can you hear me now
(You're just a sickness and a cancer)
The cancer is your filthy mouthEmbed
