In Shallow Seas We Sail Lyrics
I've got eyes in the back of my head
And I see where you're going with this
I'm not surprised
You take me for a fool and maybe you're right
If I was wiser I would not have let myself come here tonight

(You sold yourself, and) You sold yourself, you'll never learn
And here I am watching the summer fading. (The summer we shared fade away with the winter.)
(Your hands were warm, now they're) Your hands were warm on my face, now they're cold and pushing away
Slowly away. (Colder than ice and they are slowly pushing me away, pushing me away.)
Pushing me away

I knew it (I knew it) right from the start
I've got this big, big hole in my heart
I wanted (I wanted) to put you in
But for some reason
You just wouldn't fit
You just wouldn't fit

(You sold yourself, and) You sold yourself, you'll never learn
And here I am watching the summer fading. (The summer we shared fade away with the winter.)
(Your hands were warm, now they're) Your hands were warm on my face, now they're cold and pushing away
Slowly away. (Colder than ice and they are slowly pushing me away, pushing me away, pushing me away.)
Pushing me away
Pushing me away
Lust can give a man so many regrets
Just this once is what we tell ourselves

Ships don't sink if they have wind in their sails
But if the wind fails
Is there hope for me? (I guess your love,)
I thought your love was as safe as the promise you made (Was only as safe as the promise you made.)

(Now I am drowning in,) You are the storm
(Your shallow sea, I swear,) The wind and the waves, that break me in two
(You are the waves that toss me away.) And toss me away, I fell apart when I fell for you

(How can I float above the water that fills my lungs?) You are the water filling my lungs, killing me softly
(Killing me softly without a word.) Without a word, without a wordEmbed
