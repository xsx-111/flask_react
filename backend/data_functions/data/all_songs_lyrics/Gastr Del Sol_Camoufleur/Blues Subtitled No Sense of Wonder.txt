Blues Subtitled No Sense of Wonder LyricsMost blues are subtitled either no sense of wonder
Or no sense of scale
For example: I was sleeping
Subtitled "I have no idea how long"
Subtitled "I don't care how long"
Subtitled, why not untitled?
I have dozens of titles
Most blues are subtitled either no sense of wonder
Or no sense of scale
For example: there's a routine
Subtitled "I have no idea how long"
Subtitled "I don't care how long"
Subtitled, why not untitled?
I have dozens of titlesEmbed
