The Seasons Reverse LyricsSeptember reverses and the equinoxes flip
Winter slides into Fall
When glimpsed in leaps of nine months or more
The seasons reverse
They spring back and fall forward
They reshuffle when you touch down after long intervals
September reverses and the equinoxes flip
Summer becomes Spring
The seasons reshuffle
At a span of a year and a half
September reverses and the equinoxes flip
They reshuffle when you touch down after long intervals
September reverses and the equinoxes flip
Winter slides into Fall
They shuffle because it's been more than two years
First seeing you in a snowbank
Then a sweater
And then a sweater
They reshuffle with leaps of some time
Or reshuffle with leaps of distance
They reshuffle with leaps of some time
Or reshuffle with leaps of distanceEmbed
