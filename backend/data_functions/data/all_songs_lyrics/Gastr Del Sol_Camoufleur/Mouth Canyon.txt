Mouth Canyon LyricsTransparent is ok
Transparent is ok
Transparent is ok if you
Place me
At the horizon
Transparent is ok if you
Place me
At the horizon
Twelve noon at the Twig & Leaf
Three PM
Ohio Street
Ten in the evening
Almost any place
Six miles beneath the ocean
I could send myself
Traveling
And touch myself
It's a bullseye
And transparent
Is okEmbed
