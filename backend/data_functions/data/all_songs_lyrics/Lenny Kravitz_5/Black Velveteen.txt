Black Velveteen Lyrics
Black velveteen, simple and clean
Oh, what a bad machine
Black velveteen, supple and lean
Twenty-first century dream

Ready to please, free from disease
She's waiting on her knees
It's not a sin, titanium skin
Just take her for a spin

Black velveteen, simple and clean
Oh, what a bad machine
Black velveteen, supple and lean
Twenty-first century dream

Nice piece of kit, electronic clit
Just sit down for a fit
Ready to trip, a guarantee hit
She's all you ever wished

Black velveteen don't give a damn, she'll do dishes
Black velveteen knows all the night spots in France
Black velveteen's cat smells like strawberry kittens
Black velveteen always is ready to dance
She's ready to
Black velveteen, simple and clean
Oh, what a bad machine
Black velveteen, supple and lean
Twenty-first century dream

Black velveteen don't give a damn, she'll do dishes
Black velveteen knows all the night spots in France
Black velveteen's cat smells like strawberry kittens
Black velveteen always is ready to dance (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
She's ready to
Black velveteen don't give a damn, she'll do dishes
Black velveteen knows all the night spots in France
Black velveteen's cat smells like strawberry kittens
Black velveteen always is ready to dance
She's ready to

Black velveteen, simple and clean
Oh, what a bad machine
Black velveteen, supple and lean
Twenty-first century dream
Black velveteen, simple and clean
Oh, what a bad machine
Black velveteen, supple and lean
Twenty-first century dreamEmbed
