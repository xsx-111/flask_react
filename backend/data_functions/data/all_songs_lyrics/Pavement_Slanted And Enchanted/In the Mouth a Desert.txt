In the Mouth a Desert Lyrics
Can you treat it like an oil well
When it's underground, out of sight?
And if the site is just a whore-sign
Can it make enough sense to me?

Pretend the table is a trust-knot
We'll put our labels down, faith is down
I'll watch a yarn of twine unravel
And you'll never get it back

It's what I want (It's what I want)
It's what I want (Twine comes down)
It's what I want (It's what I want)
Don't you know? I could make it dry, make it dry, make it dry

I've been crowned the king of it
And it is all we have, so wait
To hear my words and they're diamond-sharp
I could open it up and it's up and down

It's what I want (It's what I want)
I'll see you beg like a little dog (Ball and twine)
Don't you know that it's what I want (It's what I want)
I'll see you beg, and it makes you dry
Make me dry, make me dry, make me dry
I've been down, the king of it
It's all we have, I've been down
And I could wait
To hear the words
They're diamond-sharp today5Embed
