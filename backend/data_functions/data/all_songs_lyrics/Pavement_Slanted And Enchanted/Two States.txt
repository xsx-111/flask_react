Two States Lyrics
Two states
We want two states
North and south
Two, two states

Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers

Two states
We want two states
There's no culture
There's no spies

Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers1Embed
