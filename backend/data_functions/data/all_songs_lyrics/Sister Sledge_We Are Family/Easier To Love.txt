Easier To Love LyricsSometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Won't someone please explain, why all the hurt and the pain?
Can't you make'em see, It's not supposed to be
All this beautiful land, see the children playing in the sand
I put to you this question (what cha asking?)
Total destruction and I don't understand why (why)
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me (oh oh)
It's easier to love, don't you see
What more can I say, war is no game you play
Give a person a little might
Well, that don't make him right
And I hope and pray, oh please let the children play
All this killing each other, you should be loving your brother
And I don't understand why, why (why)
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Yeah, let me hear you say (I do, I love you)
Won’t you say it? (I do, I love you)
I love you (I do, I love you)
I love you (I do, I love you)
Say it softly (I do, I love you)
Say it loud (I do, I love you)
Everybody (I do, I love you)
Won’t you say it? (I do, I love you)
Say it, say it, say it
(And I don't understand) No, no, why (why)
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you seeEmbed
