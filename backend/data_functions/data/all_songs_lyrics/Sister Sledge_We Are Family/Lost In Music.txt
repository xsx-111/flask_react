Lost In Music Lyrics
We're lost in music, caught in a trap
No turnin' back, we're lost in music
We're lost in music, feel so alive
I quit my nine-to-five, we're lost in music

Have you ever seen, some people lose everything
First to go is their mind? Huh
Responsibility to me is a tragedy
I'll get a job some other time, uh-huh
I want to join a band and play in front of crazy fans
Yes, I call that temptation
Give me the melody, that's all that I ever need
The music is my salvation

We're lost in music, caught in a trap
No turnin' back, we're lost in music
We're lost in music, feel so alive
I quit my nine to five, we're lost in music

Mmm, hmm, in the spotlight, the band plays so very tight
Each and every night, uh-huh
It's not vanity, to me, it's my sanity
I could never survive
Some people ask me, "What are you gonna be?
Why don't you go get a job?" Uh-uh
All that I could say, I won't give up my music
Not me, not now, no way, no how, oh... oh...

We're lost in music, caught in a trap (Caught up in our music)
No turnin' back, we're lost in music (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)
We're lost in music, feel so alive
(Don't take our away our music, feel)
I quit my nine to five, we're lost in music (I quit, yeah)
We're lost in music, caught in a trap
(Melody is good to me, I'm caught up in it)
No turnin' back, we're lost in music
(No, no, no, ooh... doo doo doo doo doo doo)
We're lost in music, feel so alive
(La da da da da da da da, mmm... hmm...)
I quit my nine to five, we're lost in music (I quit, lost in music)
We're lost in music, caught in a trap
No turnin' back, we're lost in music
We're lost in music, feel so alive
I quit my nine to five, we're lost in music
We're lost in music, caught in a trap
No turnin' back, we're lost in music1Embed
