One More Time LyricsSay it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
You keep saying that you want to love me
And I know you know that I know it's true
Surely it can't be so hard to tell me
Baby, you love me and I love you
Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
You know a girl needs to hear it
If all the things you say are true
Why can't you tell me if you feel it
I shouldn't always have to
Be the one to tell you
Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more timeEmbed
