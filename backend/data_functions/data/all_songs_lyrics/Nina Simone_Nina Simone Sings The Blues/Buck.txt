Buck Lyrics
Buck, you're a whole lot of man
Just take a look at your great big hands
You know you can crush poor me in two
But gentle, oh so gentle are the things you do
I say I never have to worry 'bout you goin' out
There ain't no other woman, ain't no need to doubt
So early to bed, and early to rise
I know just what you're thinkin' by the look in your eyes
I say, Buck, so sweet is your back
I like to wash you and kiss you when you're wet
So hold me close, and squeeze me till I sigh
Please love me, honey, 'til the day I die
I say, Buck, there ain't no other man around
Get your lover gal to calm right down
No question 'bout the way I feel for you
So gentle, oh so gentle are the things you do

Oh so gentle, oh so gentle are the things you do
Oh so gentle, oh so gentle are the things you do
OhEmbed
