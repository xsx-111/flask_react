Since I Fell for You LyricsYou made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you
Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you
It's too bad, it's too sad
I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm still in love with you
I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues 'bout every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for youEmbed
