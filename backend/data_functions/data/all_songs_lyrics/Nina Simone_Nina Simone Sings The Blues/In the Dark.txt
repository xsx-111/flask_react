In the Dark LyricsIn the dark it's just you and I
Not a sound, there's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart
In the dark
Now, in the dark, in the dark
I get such a thrill
When he presses his fingertips upon my lips
And he begs me to plase keep still
In the dark
But soon this dance will be endin'
And you're gonna be missed
Gee, I'm not pretendin'
'Cause I swear it's fun, fun to be kissed
In the dark, now we will find
What the rest have left behind
Just let them dance
We're gonna find romance
Lord, in the darkEmbed
