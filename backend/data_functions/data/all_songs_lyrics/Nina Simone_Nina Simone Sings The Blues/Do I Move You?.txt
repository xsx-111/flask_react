Do I Move You? Lyrics
Do I move you? Are you willin'?
Do I groove you? Is it thrillin'?
Do I soothe you? Tell the truth now
Do I move you? Are you loose now?
The answer better be (Yeah, yeah)
That pleases me

Are you ready for this action?
Does it give you satisfaction?
Are you hip to what I'm sayin'?
If you are then let's start swayin'
The answer better be (Yeah, yeah)
That pleases me

When I touch you, do you quiver
From your head down to your liver?
If you like it, let me know it
Don't be psychic or you'll blow it
The answer better be (Yeah, yeah)
Great God almighty, that pleases me, ohEmbed
