Real Real LyricsSay real, real
Our love is real to me
It thrills me
With perfect liberty
When you tell me you love me
And you hold me and kiss me
Then I know it's real, real
It's so real to me
Say real, real
Our love is real to me
Please thrill me
With your kisses sweet
Tell your papa and your mama
One day soon we're gonna
Have a great weddin' day
It's so real to me
I say real, real
Our love is real to me
It gives me
Perfect liberty
When you tell me you love me
And you hold me and kiss me
Then I know it's real
It's so real to me
I say real now, real
It's so real to me
Please thrill me
With your kisses sweet
Tell your papa and your mama
One day soon we're gonna
Have a great weddin' day
It's so real
So real, so real
It's so real to meEmbed
