Blues for Mama LyricsHey Lordy, mama
I heard you wasn't feeling' good
They're spreadin' dirty rumors
All around the neighborhood
They say you're mean and evil
And don't know what to do
That's the reason that he's gone
And left you black and blue
Hey yeah
Tell me what you gonna do now
They say he's left you all alone
To weather this old storm
He's got another woman now
Hangin' on his arm, yeah yeah yeah
That old fool's tellin' everybody
He's sick and tired of you
Hey Lordy, Lordy, mama
What're you gonna do?
Hey yeah
Tell me what you gonna do
They say you love to fuss and fight
And bring a good man down
And don't know how to treat him
When he takes ya on the town
They say you ain't behind him
And just don't understand
And think that you're a woman
But acting like a man
Hey Lordy mama
What you gonna do now?
Get your nerves together, baby
And set the record straight, set it straight
Let the whole round world know
It wasn't you that cause his bitter fate
All these years you loved him
And he knows it's true
'Cause what you're wantin' for your man
Is what he's wantin', too
Hey yeah
Tell me what you gonna do now
When you love a man enough
You're bound to disagree
'Cause ain't nobody perfect
'Cause ain't nobody free
Hey Lordy mama
Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do?Embed
