Whatever I Am (You Made Me) Lyrics
I was an innocent child
'Til you taught me your style
You got me doin' things
That I'd never have done

Don't criticize me, save me
'Cause whatever I am you made me
Whatever I got you gave me

I'm tryin' to hang on
Because my love is so strong
You got me doin' things
That you know I'd never have done

I say don't criticize me, save me
'Cause whatever I am you made me
Whatever I got you gave me

Well, I'm tryin' to be good like a woman can be
But you kept on talking that talk to me
And as soon as I fell, you put me down
And now you got 'em talkin' 'bout me all over this town
You know I can't, can't eat a bite
And I can't sleep at night, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause you got me doin' things
That you know ain't right, ooh, yeah

Don't criticize me, save me
'Cause whatever I am you made me
Whatever I got you gave me
Whatever I am you made me
Whatever I got you gave me

You know you did it
You know you did it, daddy
Don't scandalize me, don't scandalize me
Don't criticize me, just save me
(Whatever I got you gave me)
Baby
(Whatever I am you made me)
I said save me
(Whatever I got you gave me)
Please save me
(Whatever I am you made me)
Don't criticize me
(Whatever I got you gave me)
(Whatever I am you made me)
You know you did it, nobody but you did it
(Whatever I got you gave me)
You did it, you did it, you did it, you did it
(Whatever I am you made me)
You did it and you know it, baby
(Whatever I got you gave me)
(Whatever I am you made me)Embed
