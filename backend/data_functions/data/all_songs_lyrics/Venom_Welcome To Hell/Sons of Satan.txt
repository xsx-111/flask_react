Sons of Satan LyricsSomewhere in time, we were born
Brought blood, lust, hatred, and scorn
Sorry now you trusted me
Now I command that you get down on your knees for
Hell the deceiver, Satan's child
You're a believer and we're going wild
Put away all your virtues, stop your climbing the walls
Just sign your name on the paper, we'll have ourselves a ball
Was it the battle of envy? You were so mighty and brave
But your foolish compulsions sent you to the grave
Hell has deceived you, you were so blind
Just like all mortals, just lose your mind
Somewhere in time, we were born
Brought blood, lust, hatred, and scorn
Sorry, now you trusted me
Now I command that you get down on your knees for
Hell the deceiver, Satan's child
You're a believer and we're going wild
Put away all your virtues, stop your climbing the walls
Just sign your name on the paper, we'll have ourselves a ball
Was it the battle of envy? You were mighty and brave
But your foolish compulsions sent you to the grave
Hell has deceived you, you were so blind
Join Venom's legions, we're going wild
We're gonna destroy youEmbed
