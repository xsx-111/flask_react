Poison LyricsYour love is infectious
You're rotten to the core
Everybody knows what you got
But they still come back for more
You're everybody's favourite
You give them all a good time
Your love's a total disaster
But when they sign the dotted line they're...
Poisoned
One night with you and you've got me
Poisoned
Making love with the Devil's daughter
Poisoned
One night with you and you've got me
Poisoned
That dirty little bitch has got me
Poisoned
Sitting close beside me
Hand upon my zip
Don't bother to take it down, honey
It's about to rip
She's mommy's little virgin
Her Daddy's own pride
But she welcomed me with opened legs
Kept me satisfied
Poisoned
One night with you and you've got me
Poisoned
Making love with the Devil's daughter
Poisoned
One night with you and you've got me
Poisoned
That dirty little bitch has got me
Poisoned
Rotten!
Poisoned
One night with you and you've got me
Poisoned
Making love with the Devil's daughter
Poisoned
One night with you and you've got me
Poisoned
That dirty little bitch has got me
Poisoned
Tell me that you love me
Say you'll never leave
The more I give, the more you take
The more that you receive
I got you down beneath me
Open wide (haha...)
I'm gonna make you pay for all
The times you've cheated and lied
Poisoned
One night with you and you've got me
Poisoned
Making love with the Devil's daughter
Poisoned
One night with you and you've got me
Poisoned
That dirty little bitch has got me
Poisoned
Poisoned, poisoned
Poisoned!Embed
