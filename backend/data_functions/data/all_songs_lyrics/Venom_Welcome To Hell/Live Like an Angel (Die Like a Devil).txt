Live Like an Angel (Die Like a Devil) LyricsEvery night I'm in a different town
I'm the kind that likes to get around
Living fast, I'm on the run
I take my chances 'cos I'll only die young
Live like an angel, die like a devil
Got a place in Hell reserved for me
Live like an angel, die like a devil
Gonna burn in Hell, that's where I'm gonna be
I got no worries, I don't care what I do
I'm gonna walk all over you, aow!
Loving hard and getting high
Hell's the place I'm gonna die
'Cos I live like an angel, die like a devil
Got a place in Hell reserved for me
Live like an angel, die like a devil
Gonna burn in Hell, that's where I'm gonna be
You hear me coming, just get out of my way
I'm here tomorrow and I'm gone today
The path I'm heading got no easy track
I got the Devil riding on my back
Live like an angel, die like a devil
Got a place in Hell reserved for me
Live like an angel, die like a devil
Gonna burn in Hell, that's where I'm gonna be
You're gonna die
Live like an angel, die
Die, die
You're gonna burn in HellEmbed
