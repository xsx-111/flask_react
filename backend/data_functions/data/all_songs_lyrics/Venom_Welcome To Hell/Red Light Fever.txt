Red Light Fever LyricsI need a woman oh so bad
You ever get the feeling you've been had
You pay your money you pay the price
You take a chance and it feels so nice
Later maybe you wonder why
This little lady's gonna suck you dry
Bitch
You walk the streets as the darkness falls
You try to pass but the red light calls
When it's done and you've had your fun
You gotta treat yourself like number one
Maybe, even though she treats me bad
She's not the only one I've ever had
Bitch
I need to feel it baby can't you see
I need a girl to set my venom free
I'm going in can't you feel
Feels so good now I've broke the seal
I tell you babe I'm never satisfied
Ain't gonna die for those tears you cried
Bitch
Your makin love just like a young girl should
You move me baby like no other could
You give me love but I can see
Your lovin' isn't only meant for me
If it's a living what the hell
I see you've only got your love to sell
