In League with Satan Lyrics
Em rof deelb annog er’uoy
Deelb uoy ekam annog m’i
Senob ruoy hsurc
Luos ruoy nrub annog m’i
Lleh ni desiar
Lleh ni desiar
Natas

I'm in league with Satan
I was raised in hell
I walk the streets of Salem
Amongst the living dead
I need no one to tell me
What's wrong or right
I drink the blood of children
Stalk my prey at night

Look out
Beware, when the full moon's high n' bright
In every way, I'm there
In every shadow in the night
Evil in league with Satan
Evil in league with Satan
I'm in league with Satan
Obey his commands
With the goat of Mendes
Sitting at his left hand
I'm in league with Satan
I love the dead
No one prayed for Sodom
As the people fled

Look out
Beware, when the full moon's high n' bright
In every way, I'm there
In every shadow in the night
Evil in league with Satan
Evil in league with Satan

I'm in league with Satan
I am the masters own
I drink the juice of women
As they lie alone
I'm in league with Satan
I bear the devils mark
I kill the new born baby
Tear the infants flesh
Look out
Beware, when the full moon's high n' bright
In every way, I'm there
In every shadow in the night
Evil in league with Satan
Evil in league with Satan

Luos ruoy tnaw I
Lleh ni nrub annog er’uoy
Natas htiw eugael ni m’i
Nevaeh ni evres naht lleh ni ngier ot rettebEmbed
