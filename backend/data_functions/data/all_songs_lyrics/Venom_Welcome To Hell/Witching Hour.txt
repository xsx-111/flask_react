Witching Hour LyricsCome hear, the moon is calling
The witching hour draws near
Come hear the bell is tolling
Mortals run in fear
Prepare the altar now
And hear the virgins cry
Hold fast the sacrifice
For now it's the time to die
All hell breaks loose
Hell's breaking loose
Unveil the pentagram
And feel the demons lust
Come watch the holy men
Who look on in disgust
Come taste the blood and feel
The heat of Satan's breath
Look in the skies and see
The warriors of death
All hell breaks loose
Hell's breaking loose
Witching hour, move it
Our work is now complete
The blood runs fast and free
And Satan takes his bride
And cries of blasphemy
All hell rejoices at the child
That she will bear
And Satan's only son
Shall be the worlds despair
All hell breaks loose
Hell's breaking loose
Witching hour, witching hourEmbed
