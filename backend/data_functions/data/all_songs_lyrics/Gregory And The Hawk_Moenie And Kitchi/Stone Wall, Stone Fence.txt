Stone Wall, Stone Fence LyricsBig open land
You hold the weight of the air in your hands
Big open air
You feel the tickle of the trees on your chest
Why'd you go and waste it
The things that you know
Are making you a stone wall, stone fence
Your stories so old you just tend to keep them
Long winding road
You've got a secret but you won't share it4Embed
