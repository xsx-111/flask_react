Oats We Sow Lyrics
Some day I'll toss all your presents
And bury the letters left unsent

'Cause it's bad to do what's easy just 'cause it's easy
And I want to do what pleases me but I can't

And the road she'd roll
Round the side of the mountain with nowhere to go
But the heart we know when it's lovin'
It's leanin' toward bein' alone

Someday I'll find the mind to mend it
And make dry these eyes I've gotten wet

'Cause it's bad to do what's easy just 'cause it's easy
And I wanna do what pleases me but I can't, oh no

When the crow he'd mow
Half the grass on the knoll and no where to go
But the heart we know when it's needin'
It's careenin' towards bein' alone

And the oats we sow
They could seed on forever with nowhere to grow
But the heart we know when it's askin'
Its exact twin, it will not be aloneEmbed
