Superlegend LyricsToo young to be super legend
And no one knows of you
So go sing yourself to bed
I'm a better, better friend
To win your love
It's all I'm not
Two tiers above the best I've got
All I see of you is smooth, smooth
And hot, hot
Get lost in the rottenness of it all
Come on, I'm a crutch in a pinch
And you're too much
Get a hold of yourself
Get over yourself, man
To win your love
It's all I'm not
Two tiers above the best I've got
The best I've gotEmbed
