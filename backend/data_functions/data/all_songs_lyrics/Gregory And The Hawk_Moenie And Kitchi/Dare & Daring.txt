Dare & Daring LyricsHead out into the yard
I'm willing to stay now that the rain's behind us
My legs don't hurt on this lawn
Your face takes the place of days I have lost
I wonder what night will bring
It's funny, it seems like a memory
If you like it I will like it too
If I fake it you will make it true
But this is a dare and I'm daring you
Oh this is a dare and I'm daring you
Headlights and rows of pylons
I made the mistake of not getting gone and staying put when I could
And smelling soot instead of wood
I wonder what night will bring
It's funny, seems like a memory
If you like it I will like it too
If I fake it you will make it true
But this is a dare and I'm daring you
Oh this is a dare and I'm daring you
Spending some time in my house
The outside is a rumble
I'm quiet as a mouse behind shut doors
And I wonder what night will bring
It's funny, seems like a memory
If you like it I will like it too
If I fake it you will make it true
Well this is a dare and I'm daring youEmbed
