Grey Weather LyricsGrey weather, just fool me, just tell me I'm right
Despite the careless words you say, I'm always keeping faith
Chart the numbers, see a trend, we are moving in place
Despite your lack of blowing over, I'm always keeping faith
And you'd say, this is not the time for goodbyes
It's too late
You'd say, this is not the time for goodbyes
It's too late
It's too late
In the bright light of morning, map the last leg of the trip
I call on you to catch me as I'm coming over that bridge
Through the mind-fog of the beach and the cracking concrete
The broken wings of reverie leave me always having faith
And you'd say, this is not the time for goodbyes
It's too late
You'd say, this is not the time for goodbyes
It's too late
It's too late1Embed
