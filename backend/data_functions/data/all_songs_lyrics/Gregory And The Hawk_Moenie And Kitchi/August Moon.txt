August Moon LyricsAugust moon made just for you
A steady ready smile like His
Until it’s out of sight
Don’t undo the true chance that chooses you
Face to face with a new day
So simple it seems
You dare to dream impossibly
Risky in its rarity I'm bound to it now
Black and blissful tumbling
Awake, asleep
It feeds me
Fate will rule you, the heart
It fools you to lose your sanityEmbed
