Wild West LyricsWhen the end comes you'll see
Hydrogen electrolysed
Amazing, you're amazed
At the cold you see the fire by your face
Bitter bloom, flightless skies
To fear the doom, it's no surprise
Now realize
There's no sense in losing your mind
Before your time
In order not to worry you write the words down
But it's a fool's game and your game face is shameful
So rise young sun you're a tireless one
And you'll be back, burning
When the morning comes
When you catch my soul upon waking
Will you make a wish
For the wild west to accept the excess?
When the end comes you'll see
Fields of green beyond your reach
And heartbeats
Rise young sun, you're a tireless one
And you'll be back, burning
When the morning comes
When you catch my soul upon waking
Will you make a wish
For the fool's game to equal his insane?1Embed
