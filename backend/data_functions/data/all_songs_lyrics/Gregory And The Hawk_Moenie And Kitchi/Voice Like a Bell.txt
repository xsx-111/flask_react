Voice Like a Bell Lyrics

Noisy in my head
Voice rings like a bell
And try as I might, I cannot forget
And try as I might, I cannot love you less
Say how long you'll stay
Wrapped up in the hour
Marking off the days

Maybe we both
Knew it at the time
Maybe we both
Knew it at the time

Well, I don't know about you
But for me (but for me)
It's about (it's about)
The passing of measures
But for me (but for me)
It's about (it's about)
All of life's little pleasures
And I feel you're taking away
The most you can from our lazy days
Maybe we both
Maybe we both
Maybe we both
Knew it at the time

Maybe we both
Knew it at the time
Maybe we both
Knew it at the time
Maybe we both
Knew it at the timeEmbed
