Two-Faced Twin LyricsYou're a mirror with two faces
Two sides, simple as that
When I look at my reflection
Do I see myself?
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you run away
You're a fish with two fins
Swimming in opposite directions
When I go in for a kiss
Do I kiss him?
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you run away
Some hearts, some times, leave blind
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you run away
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you run away
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't youEmbed
