Day & Age LyricsSounds like a good idea to me
You've always wanted freedom over responsibility
I added it up
You had me but now I'm gone
Sounds like a good idea to me
You never said exactly what I wanted to hear
And the hearsay and naysaying
Ain't what I want in this day and age
I kiss you all right
I kiss you goodnight
But you were just asking for the time
I want a meeting
I want a meeting of the minds
I kiss you all right
I kiss you goodnight
But you were just asking for the time
I want a meeting
I want a meeting of the minds
Sounds like a good idea to me
It's oh so much energy to ask for your sympathy
In hard times and good times
And maybe the time will come around
I kiss you all right
I kiss you goodnight
But you wеre just asking for the time
I want a meeting
I want a meeting
I kiss you all right
I kiss you goodnight
But you wеre just asking for the time
I want a meeting
I want a meeting
I want a meeting
I want a meeting of the mindsEmbed
