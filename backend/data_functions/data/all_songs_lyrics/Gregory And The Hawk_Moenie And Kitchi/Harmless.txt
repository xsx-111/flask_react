Harmless LyricsSo you think you do no harm
I caught you once when you were young
So you think I'd benefit
But a curse is what you make of it
Oh, I will greet you when
Someone feeds you sin
Like my own
I will need you then
Without you I have no doubt
I'd have grown up with an angel's mouth
Well, here we are, so tightly wound
Catapult this stone to hit the clouds
Oh, I will greet you when
Someone feeds you sin
Like my own
I will need you then
Like an inhalation
Oh, I will greet you when
Someone feeds you sin
Like my ownEmbed
