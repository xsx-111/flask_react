No Reply LyricsWent to see the hills of Virginia
Drove back through the corner of Pennsylvania
Wrote you to tell you I would never be the same
But no reply came
Gone on a plane to Seattle
Rode out with some friends to Chicago
Wrote you a letter to say I miss your company
But you would never see it
Is this the way you talk about me when I'm gone
Is this the way you feel when I’ve been dealing strong
I wanna hold up, relax, make due like I can't get anything back
Hold up, relax
Winter wеars and tears at my freedom
And Georgia eats you up likе the little peach you are
You say hold on cause I'm gonna hit you back
But I’ll never see it
Is this the way you talk about me when I'm gone
Do you hit back, relax
Go on and do it like I never get anything back
Like I'll never get anything back
Like I'll never get anything back
Is this the way you talk about me when I'm gone
Take it back, relax
Go on and do it
Go on and do it
Go on and do itEmbed
