Ghost Lyrics
I woke up with my head on a bee's nest
And my feet on your jacket
It was a wild it was a wrong it was a long long night

And your lips are like little stings
Set me to wondering
If there's anyway and anytime
I could have, I would have tried

I had you back but then you ran
Like you never ever knew me
Fall into my arms again
Like you always wanted to
You always wanted to
But you never ever knew

I woke up with my mind on a reason
For why it's right to be leavin' you
Until we're drawn into the swarm
Of a warm white tide

And your lips are like little stings
Set me to wondering
If there's anyway and anytime
I could have, I would have tried
I had you back but then you ran
Like you never ever knew me
Fall into my arms again
Like you always wanted to
You always wanted to
But you never ever knew

And now you find it's harder to see
The future so clearly
Will it always be?
Will it always be?

I had you back but then you ran
Like you never ever knew me
Fall into your arms again
Like you always wanted to
You always wanted to
But we never ever knewEmbed
