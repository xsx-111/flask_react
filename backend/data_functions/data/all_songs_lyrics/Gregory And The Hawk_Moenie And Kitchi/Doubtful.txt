Doubtful LyricsIt's a step
It's a step in the right direction
It's a tough and final decision
'Cause where will I go when I'm feeling blue?
Spinning my wheels
Wasting my time
Making you feel you've nothing to hide
So save me and tell me how
It all got so doubtful
Leave me nothing now
Back on the old road
You're wishing you'll wind me down
Give me a mouthful
And leave me nothing now
So chalk it up to the drone
Hack it out, wear it down
Where will you go when you're feeling blue?
So save me and tell me how
It all got so doubtful
Leave me nothing now
Back on the old road
You're wishing you'll wind me down
Give me a mouthful
And leave me nothing now
So save me and tell me how
It all got so doubtful
Leave me nothing now
Back on the old road
You're wishing you'll wind me down
Give me a mouthful
And leave me nothing nowEmbed
