Reject Lyrics
Who the hell are you to tell me
What I am and what's my master plan?
What makes you think that it includes you?
Self-righteous wealth, stop flattering yourself

So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Sucking up to your social sect
Making you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone

You're not my type, not my type

What's the difference between you and me?
I do what I want, and you do what you're told
So listen and shut the hell up
It's no big deal, and I'll see you in hell

So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Sucking up to your social sect
Making you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone
You're not my type, not my type
Not my type, you're not my type

So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Falling from grace, right on my face
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone
So when the smoke clears, here I am
Say again, what?10Embed
