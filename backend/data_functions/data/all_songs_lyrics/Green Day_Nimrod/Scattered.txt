Scattered Lyrics
Well, I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we've shared
Makes me wish that you were here, 'cause
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
Well, all the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes, well

Open the past and present now, and we are there
Story to tell, and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future, too
It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you

Well, loose ends tied in knots leaving a lump down in my throat
I'm gagging on a souvenir
Live to fill another year
We'll drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds
Well, leaving myself open wide
Living out a sacrifice, well

Open the past and present now, and we are there
Story to tell, and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future, too
It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you
If you got no one
And I got no place to go
Would it be alright?
Could it be alright?

Well, I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we've shared
Makes me wish that you were here, 'cause
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
Well, all the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes, well

Open the past and present now, and we are there
Story to tell, and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future, too
It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you
It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you6Embed
