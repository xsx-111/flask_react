Feel Alright Lyrics
I was born my papa's son
A wandering eye and a smoking gun
Now some of you would live through me
Then lock me up and throw away the key
Or just find a place to hide away
And hope that I just go away

That I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
I feel alright, I feel alright tonight

I'll bring you precious contraband
And ancient tales from distant lands
Of conquerors and concubines
And conjurers from darker times
Betrayal and conspiracy
Sacrilege and heresy

That I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
I feel alright, I feel alright tonight

I got everything you won't need
Your darkest fear, your fondest dream
I ask you questions, tell you lies
Criticize and sympathize
Yeah but be careful what you wish for, friend
Because I've been to hell and now I'm back again
I feel alright, yeah I feel alright tonight
Yeah I feel alright, and I feel alright tonight
I feel alright, I feel alrightEmbed
