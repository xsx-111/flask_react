Poor Boy Lyrics
I was born on the other side of town
Everybody over here just puttin' me down
I never thought about it much
Till the first time I saw you
Uh oh, what's a poor boy gonna do?

It's bad enough to love you from afar
Me down here and you up where you are
If you hadn't given me that look
That's all it took, it's true
Uh oh, what's a poor boy gonna do?

Baby, what's a poor boy got?
Not a heck of a lot
Just a heart that's true
One thing he sure don't need
Is a heart that bleeds
And these lovesick blues

I know a poor boy can't go far
Baby, maybe someday drive your car
I can look in my rearview
Into those eyes of blue
Uh oh what's a poor boy gonna do?
Baby, what's a poor boy got?
Not a heck of a lot
Just a heart that's true
One thing he sure don't need
Is a heart that bleeds
And these lovesick blues

I know a poor boy can't go far
Baby, maybe someday drive your car
I can look in my rearview
Into those eyes of blue
Uh oh what's a poor boy gonna do?
Uh oh what's a poor boy gonna do?Embed
