CCKMP LyricsYeah, cocaine cannot kill my pain
Cocaine cannot kill my pain
Cocaine cannot kill my pain
Like a freight train through my vein
Cocaine cannot kill my pain
Now whiskey got no hold on me
Whiskey got no hold on me
Whiskey got no hold on me
Left them chains in Tennessee
Whiskey got no hold on me
Now don't come knocking on my door
Girl, don't come knocking on my door
Don't come knocking on my door
Even that won't work no more
Don't come knocking on my door
'Cause heroin's the only thing
Heroin's the only thing
Heroin's the only thing
The only gift the darkness brings
Heroin's the only thing
Guess you'd best leave me alone
Guess you'd best leave me alone
Guess you'd best leave me alone
At least until these blues have gone
Guess you'd best leave me alone
Cocaine cannot kill my pain
Cocaine cannot kill my pain
Cocaine cannot kill my pain
Like a freight train through my vein
Cocaine cannot kill my painEmbed
