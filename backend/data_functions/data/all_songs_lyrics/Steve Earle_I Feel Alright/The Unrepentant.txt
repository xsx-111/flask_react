The Unrepentant Lyrics
In the middle of the night
In the middle of a lonely night
Stands alone in the pale moonlight
Screams out in defiance
He's got no one to turn to
You could talk until you turn blue
He'd just turn his back on you
Ain't no compromising

Because he's totally untamed
No fear of the unnamed
Oh man, he'll take the blame
Someone's got to do it
Someone's got to

He is now out on the highway
He's got the key and the right of way
Tank is full and his toll is paid
Hellbound and determined
He run a dangerous payload
When he comes to the crossroads
Ah man, it's all timed to explode
'Cause you'll just see the sky burning
Because he's totally untamed
No fear of the unnamed
Oh man, he'll take the blame
Someone's got to do it
Someone's got to

Now he's standing at hell's door
With a bad attitude and a forty-four
The Devil said, "What's up, man?
Now what you come here for?"
He said, "Man, let's just get to it"
He said, "I always heard that you were the bad one
There's a few places I ain't been, a few things I ain't done
You got your pitchfork and I got my gun
Someone's gotta do it"

He's totally untamed
No fear of the unnamed
Oh man, he'll take the blame
Someone's got to do it
Someone's got to
He's totally untamed
No fear of the unnamed
Stand up like a man taking the whole blame
Someone's got to do it
Someone's got to
Someone's got to
Someone's got to
Totally untamedEmbed
