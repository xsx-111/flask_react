South Nashville Blues LyricsI went downtown, it was just to ease my pain
I went downtown, it was just to easy my pain
I ended up out walking in the rain
I took my pistol and a hundred dollar bill
I took my pistol and a hundred dollar bill
I had everything I need to get me killed
Southside gals, they suit me just fine
Southside gals, they suit me just fine
As long as I got money, they don't whine
The devil lives on Lewis Street, I swear
The devil lives on Lewis Street, I swear
I seen him rocking in his rocking chair
I start way up top of Lewis Street and I walk down to the end
I start way up top and I walk down to the end
I go way down in the bottoms and I come back up again
Now Mama told me, Papa too
They both talked till they turned blue
But I got them old South Nashville blues again
I won't be satisfied until they lock me up againEmbed
