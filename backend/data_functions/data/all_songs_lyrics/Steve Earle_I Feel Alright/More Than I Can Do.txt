More Than I Can Do Lyrics
I'm trying hard to let you go, but it's more than I can do
And every day or two, I wind up right back where I started
I'm trying not to let you know that I'm still in love with you
I can't just sit home blue 'cause there ain't no rest for the broken-hearted
Just because you won't unlock your door
That don't mean you don't love me anymore

So I'm never going to let you go
No matter what you do
Because you know it's more than I can do

You told me that I got to stop, but it's more than I can do
And that ain't nothing new 'cause we both know I'm crazy about you
You said you're going to call the cops, but I ain't gonna run
Because you're the only one
There ain't no way I could live without you
You left me just when I needed you
So l ain't even close to through with you

So I'm never going to let you go
No matter what you do
Because you know it's more than I can doEmbed
