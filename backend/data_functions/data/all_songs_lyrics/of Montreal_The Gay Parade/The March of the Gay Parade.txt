Hey, it's the march of the gay parade!
Hey, it's the march of the gay parade! Yes!
Hey, it's the march of the gay parade! Right!
All the people look so beautiful
While they're marching in the gay parade
They make friends with trees and animals
They gather up all the countries flags
And they burn them
There is nothing left on earth to separate them
I assure you they feel
Completely free and pretty happy
All the people look so beautiful
While they're marching in the gay paradeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
