Neat Little Domestic Life LyricsYou clean the bathroom
And I do the dishes
I water the lawn
And you feed the fishes
What a neat little domestic life that we live
You change the light bulb and I hold the ladder
I get the frying pan and you mix the batter
What a neat little domestic life that we live
All the lonely days are gone
Those long lonely days when I was alone
And I felt this world was not the place I belonged
But then I met you and now I belong
You rake the leaves and I start a fire
I clean out the shed and you turn on the dryer
What a neat little domestic life that we live
I brush the dog and you knit a sweater
You vacuum the rug and I write a letter
What a neat little domestic life that we live
I clear the table and you draw the curtain
You ask if I'm happy and I tell you I'm certain
That this neat little domestic life is for meEmbed
