The Autobiographical Grandpa LyricsI take a walk I mow the grass
I don't worry 'bout
The years that pass
My wife is dead I live alone
In my little country home
I have my memories
And dogs for friends
I water the ferns I plant some seeds
I make sure to pull out all the weeds
And to help myself along
I like to whistle this funny little song
I sang in my army days when I was young
A hot air balloon I will float away
At times when I'm holding you
My kids and grandkids come
To stay with me once a year
And on New Years I drive down to be with them
Though I'm happy often I feel lonely
But when I sleep I hear my wife speak
Don't feel alone because you're not really alone
Sweetheart no don't think you're alone
I feed the cat I sweep the floor
I don't fear dying anymore
I like to fish with Ed and Will
In the pond by the old paper mill
I am resigned to finish off my days this wayEmbed
