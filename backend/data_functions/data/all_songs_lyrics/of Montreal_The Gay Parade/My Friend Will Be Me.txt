My Friend Will Be Me LyricsI wish I knew a man
Someone to steal me
From this sadness
I wish I knew a girl
Who'd run her fingers
Through my hair and kiss me
Wish I didn't have to pretend
That when I'm talking to the floor I'm talking to you
If I had a friend then
Such stupid things I'd never have to do
I wish I had a friend
I wish I knew a man
One who'd help me stop disguising my feelings
I wish I knew a girl
Who'd keep me from silencing my heart's voice
Oh I wish I didn't feel like an island
No country will claim
Wish I had a friend who'd stop me
From falling into this depression all over again
I wish I had a friend like that
Oh, but I know it will never be
So that friend for me has to come from inside of me
My friend will have to be me
I wish I knew a man
Someone to help me stop being self conscious
I wish I knew a girl
One to take away my fear of dying
I wish I weren't afraid that some spirit
Will come out of the darkness and carry me away
I wish I had a friend whom if that happened
Would storm right in and save the day
I wish I had a friend like that
Oh, but I know it will never be
So that friend for me has to come from inside of me
My friend will have to be meEmbed
