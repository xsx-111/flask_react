My Favorite Boxer LyricsHector Ormano is my favorite boxer
He goes smasho and everyone cheers
He turns big men to whimpering cowards
He’s so strong and how I adore him
Cause I’m so weak
So much so that I’m afraid
To walk alone down my street
I know I’ll never be as brave as Hector Ormano
Hector Ormano is my favorite boxer
His smile is so white like elephant ivory
He’s so handsome and all of his girlfriends
Are tall and blonde with hourglass curves
But I don’t know many girls
And I certainly don’t know any girls like that
Even if I did I wouldn’t be as cool as Hector Ormano
One summer day I was sitting on the bridge
Looking at the water below
When I heard some laughter and a familiar voice
Coming from down the road
It was then that I saw and my heart nearly dropped
I saw Hector Ormano with some friends
And as they approached my mind went blank
As I struggled to find the words
I was dying to tell him
As Hector walked by he picked up a stick
And threw it at my head
His friends went quiet and Hector said to me
“What are you looking at wimp?”
HECTOR!!!
Hector Ormano is my favorite boxer
Even though he was mean to me
My father says I’m a meaningless no one
Compared to the perfect Hector OrmanoEmbed
