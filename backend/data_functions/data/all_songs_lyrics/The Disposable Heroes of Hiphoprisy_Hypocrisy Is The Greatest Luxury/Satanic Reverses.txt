Satanic Reverses Lyrics
Hallelujah

In the 1970's
The OPEC nations began to dominate
The world's oil economy
In the 1980's
Japan became the world's
Number one economic power
In 1989 the nations of Eastern Europe
Attempted to restructure
While in the United States civil rights have
Collapsed at the hands of fundamentalists
And national insecurity's at an all time high
Exxon and on and on and on
The ministers of double speak
New meaning of clean they tried to teach us
They staged the phoney shampoo of the Valdez greases
Completely Jheri curled the beaches
Pipe bomb for the NAACP
And a hit on Salman Rushdie, the Berlin Wall comes down
And the U.S. cracks down on illegal aliens
Ban the freedom of choice for those wanting abortion
And enforce capitol punishment
Twenty four hour radio ban
For indecency determined by the F.U.C.C
Why are we so anesthetized to the lies?
Because we do it in our own lives
We believe all the things that we want to hear
But then we also love to criticize
Bail out the banks
Loan art to the churches
Satanic Reverses
X4

In 1992 the European economic community will reform
In 1997 the city of Hong Kong will become
A part of the People's Republic of China
In 1999, and this is no coincidence
The nation of Panama will control it's own canal
While in the United States
Civil rights have collapsed at the hands of Fundamentalists
And national insecurity's at an all time high
Helms said ban the photograph of the Piss Christ
It's sacrilegious, not an art piece
While we all try to discern between our cup of tea
And what we call obscenity, the house's legislation
Ripped the phoney foundation off what we thought inherent
Sent Joey to the Supreme Court
Cause he made a statement, they called it
Desecration of the symbol that was meant to represent
The freedom of so called choice and dissent
They almost had me believing it, they were bleeding him
He said, "Burn baby, burn"
'Til the street Samurai said to my face
That any flag that's worth a shit
Was woven from fire in the first place
