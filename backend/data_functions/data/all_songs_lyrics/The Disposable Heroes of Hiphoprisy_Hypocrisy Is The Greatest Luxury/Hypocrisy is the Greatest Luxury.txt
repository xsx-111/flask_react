Hypocrisy is the Greatest Luxury Lyrics
Life these days can be so complex
We don't make the time to stop and reflect
I know from first hand experience, one can go delirious
Seriously, it can be like that
But before I put my foot in my mouth
'Cause that's what I'm about to start talking about
Please let me confess before all the rest
That I'm afflicted by this addicted like most in the U.S
It's tough to make a living when you're an artist
It's even tougher when you're socially conscious
Careerism, opportunism can turn the politics into cartoonism
Let's not patronize or criticize
Let's open the door and look inside
Pull the file on this state of denial

Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
The bass, the treble, don't make a rebel, having your life together does
America has an image of a young one
Fast living, not give an expletive
No respect for his or the lives of those around him
Suicidal, homicidal or at very least extremely unbridled
How convenient for those who would like to destroy him
The problem has never been our political logic, but the way we enact it
We can imagine a perfect society but can't maintain a decent relationship
The failure found in the luxury, not in the hardship

Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard

The next section is devoted strictly to great silence
Just sounds we consider to be very exciting and worth listening to

Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standard
Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury
Raise the double standardEmbed
