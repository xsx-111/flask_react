Socio-Genetic Experiment Lyrics
Sometimes I feel like a socio-genetic experiment
A petri-dish community's token of infection
I feel like a socio-genetic experiment
A petri-dish community's token of infection

You see I'm African Native American
Irish and German
I was adopted by parents who loved me
They were the same color
As the kids who called me nigga
On the walk home from school
I cried until I found out what it meant
Then I got me some equipment
My fists, man
I was a hit man with no friends
But who the hell am I cursing those whose skin
Is half my DNA
Why am I
And why shouldn't I
Be ashamed of this fact
After all the feces they dumped on me
And my species

Those filthy mother...
Shut 'cho mouth
There I go again with those high and mighty speeches
When they are in fact part of my species
Or is it the other way around
Did I piss in their gene pool
If I did it wouldn't matter
They kept me in the deep end
'Cause the slightest dilution
In their solution
Was perceived as pollution


I am not solely race, nor environment, nor destiny
I am the human scientific process
Over and over and over again
The dirt that I shovel to uncover the truth
Often buries something else growing
Acceptance of my own
Weakness and my own intolerance
Is seldom
But that is in fact my identity
Uncluttered by the maskings of consumer addiction
Ethnocentricity
In the light of miscegenation
This fable of elements
Which classify order, species, subspecies
Genus, phyla
Animal, vegetable, illegal, chemical
Socialist, Democrat, Republican
Yuppy, buppy, guppy
Proud, racist
Black, white, African, Native American, Irish, and German

And I'm proudEmbed
