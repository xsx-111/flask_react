Everyday Life Has Become A Health Risk Lyrics
The wind shifted
Back in the fifties particles drifted
A wave set in motion
The Pacific Ocean
Test to the hydrogen bomb
There from would come
Too close to home
Ships from the test
Put to rest
And convalesce with heavily armed guard
In Hunter's Point shipyard
Heavy metal sandblast
Facemask deoxidize
Remove the radiation from the outside
A hazardous cargo
Dumped into the harbor
Went farther then that though
Sand from the blasting
Made into sidewalks
Played on by kids
That just got over chicken-pox
Glowing faces
All races
Hopscotch bare feet
On Geiger counter concrete
Mother prepares a fruit salad treat to eat
Sprayed with messed up pesticides
None have been tested for health effects
On the side
Medical racist social statistics
Has everyday life become a health risk
X2

Meanwhile, back in the backyard
Father lights-up a barbecue fire
And he sizzles hormone injected meat
On top of a toxic source of heat
He becomes light headed
As the toxins easily meet
With the lite beer in his head and
He glances to his portable television set
From his eyes he wipes the double vision sweat
Visions of white supremacists
Posing as right conservationists
Holding an Aryan agrarian Woodstock
Lead the stray sheep into the flock
Hooking em in with the music of flower power
Change their energy into fire power


All of a sudden
Acid rain falls from the sky
And gets into the nuclear family picnic pie
Not to mention their Kool-Aid
The nuclear family sits down to lunch
They munch it down with acid rain punch
And they begin to hallucinate
Disassociate
The pain in their bodies
From the pain in their minds
They go inside and remember a time
Before the world went
Completely blind
When people grew bald naturally
No mutations
Unlike Skinheads
And chemo-therapy patients
