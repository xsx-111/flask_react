He Poos Clouds LyricsLazy, you lazy poet, your words are reckless, and I can’t feel it
But hey, hey, all the boys I have ever loved have been digital
I’ve been a guest on a screen, or in a book
I move him with my thumbs, I move him with my thumbs
I write his name in nothing, he whispers to the author
That I will be the only one
Escape! Escape! This time, for real!
We fool around in the service lane
He’s the only friend I have who doesn’t do cocaine
And all the boys I have ever loved have been confidential
Had a broken home, or a seedy past
So I know, I know it’s gonna last
Move him with my thumbs, I move him with my thumbs
He needs, he needs my guidance, he needs, he needs my time
And I am not the only one
He swam! To the edge! Of the wall! Of the world!
Followed my, followed my voice! And he cried!
“Master! The answer is maybe, maybe not!
Maybe not! Maybe not! I have goals!
Gotta fulfill the seven prophecies
Gotta be a friend to grandmother
Gotta rescue Michael from the White Witch
Gotta find and kill my shadow self
Gotta dig up every secret seashell
You may have been made for love
But I’m just made.”Embed
