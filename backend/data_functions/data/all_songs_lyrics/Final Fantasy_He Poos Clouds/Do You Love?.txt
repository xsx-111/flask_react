Do You Love? LyricsThis kitchen has a king!
This hand, this hand is a cunning little bugger
With a habit of turning every A into a B
Unless it’s put to work
There’s a twitch twitch twitch, there’s a rash, there’s an itch
For a job, for a magic job, and a magic diet and exercise plan
There are things I cannot do
I cannot not not turn a skinny little shit
Into a winsome Brit who spent his youth in honest pleasure
For all my wily ways
I cannot not not turn back into the boy
It’s a tearful day when a boy must learn his limitations
Take a look at this brochure:
Inject, inject, strip away, peel away
The scars of self abuse with a couple of hours in a private clinic
What have I left in life?
The knife! The knife! This knife! This knife!
Every inch, every inch of me will come to know its magic!Embed
