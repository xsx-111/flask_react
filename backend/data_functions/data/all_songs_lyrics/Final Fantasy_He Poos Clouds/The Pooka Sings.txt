The Pooka Sings LyricsOh, your eyes, your greedy eyes
Your dry and desperate tongue
You’ve told a lie, a lie, a lie
For every pretty note your reedy voice has sung
Do we believe in devils? (No...)
Winged men? The healing power of love? (No...)
Enchantment? Social justice? (No...)
Dead child actors in a white, white world above? (No...)
Why are all these songs about the things that don’t exist?
Do not resist, we’ll burn these lies tonight and never let them live
Oh, stoke the fire, we’ll burn these words tonight and never let them live
The Pooka wings away
His power over me’s at an end
And I put down my violin
I leave it down, never againEmbed
