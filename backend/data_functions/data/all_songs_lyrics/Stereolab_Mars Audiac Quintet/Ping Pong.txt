Ping Pong Lyrics
It's alright, 'cause the historical pattern has shown
How the economical cycle tends to revolve
In a round of decades, three stages stand out in a loop
A slump and war, then peel back to square one and back for more

Bigger slump and bigger wars
And a smaller recovery
Huger slump and greater wars
And a shallower recovery

You see, the recovery always comes 'round again
There's nothing to worry for, things will look after themselves
It's alright, recovery always comes 'round again
There's nothing to worry if things can only get better

There's only millions that lose their jobs
And homes and sometimes accents
There's only millions that die
In their bloody wars, it's alright

It's only their lives and the lives
Of their next of kin that they are losing
It's only their lives and the lives
Of their next of kin that they are losing
It's alright, 'cause the historical pattern has shown
How the economical cycle tends to revolve
In a round of decades, three stages stand out in a loop
A slump and war, then peel back to square one and back for more

Bigger slump and bigger wars
And a smaller recovery
Huger slump and greater wars
And a shallower recovery
Don't worry, be happy
Things will get better naturally
Don't worry, shut up, sit down
Go with it and be happy1Embed
