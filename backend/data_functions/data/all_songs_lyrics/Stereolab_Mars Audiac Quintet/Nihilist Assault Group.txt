Nihilist Assault Group LyricsWhat's 'morals' after all?
A set of rules from above
Moral panic calls for more censorship
While annihilating 'le perdure sens critique
Critique', moral panic calls for more censorship
What's 'morals' after all?
A set of rules from above
Morals which don't even tackle the real issues
Morals which seek intervention and control
Morals which don't even address the real problems
What's 'morals' after all?
A set of rules from above
Morals which don't even tackle the real issues
Morals which don't even address the real problems
Morals that just seek control over our livesEmbed
