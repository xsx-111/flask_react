International Colouring Contest LyricsInto outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's space for Lucia
Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's place for Lucia
Before Armstrong took his steps
She'd been there with friends
They took all instruments and
Recorded on the moon
Gathered variety of sounds
From where the air is different
I'm so full of ideas
And here is a good one
Lucia has a dream
A dream that comes in colour of
International colouring
For your entry she's waiting
Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's space for Lucia
Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's space for LuciaEmbed
