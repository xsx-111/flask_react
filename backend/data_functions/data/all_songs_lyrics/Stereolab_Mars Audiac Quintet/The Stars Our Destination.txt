The Stars Our Destination LyricsIn a fluid and shifting
Creative and destructive
Like water when it burns
Conjunction of opposites
Active/passive principles
Freedom/slave, fire/water
In a fluid and shifting
Creative and destructive
Like water when it burns
Conjunction of opposites
Active/passive principles
Fame/glory, fire/water
In a fluid and shifting
I will drink fire/waterEmbed
