Transona Five LyricsThey are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables, two inevitables
We can't avoid dyingEmbed
