Chapel Perilous LyricsIt's just the chapel perilous
You can ride the bus for free
Surf's up, better get your stuff
When you catch a wave stay young
Reach out and have yourself a touch
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
Come true, come true, come true
When you wish upon the star
Dreams come trueEmbed
