Head Out LyricsLazy eye
Looks that could kill when I satisfy
All I can take
Feeling wry
Playin' a fool
In the paradise
I can see strange
You don't have to wait
Lately I've
Looked through the bills for an alibi
But they don't show
Easy guy
Maybe you took too much
Now you're dry
And on your own
Welcome to my show
If you'd like to know me well4Embed
