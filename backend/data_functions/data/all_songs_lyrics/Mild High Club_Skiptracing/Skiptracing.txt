Skiptracing Lyrics
Can you sing to this harmony?
Can you let a quartet set you free?
This tonality, doesn't disagree
Ought to be chromatically pleasin' me

All that I want
Is some good loving musical thoughts

I got to see, learn this history
Pull another record from your sleeve
A mystery, if you don't believe
Slip another coin in my machine
(Baby, you're my kind)

All that I want (All I wanna, hear the drum ah)
Is some good listening musical pop (And Madonna. And marijuana)
The gift keeps giving
Use what you've got  (shake it mama, upset your karma)
Not what you're missing

All that I want (All I wanna, hear the drum ah)
Is some good listening musical pop (And Madonna. And marijuana)
The gift keeps giving
Use what you've got  (Shake it mama, upset your karma)
Not what you're missing4Embed
