Kokopelli LyricsI'm the Kokopelli in the cave
When I'm in the mood I like to play
Bend a couple rules and misbehave
Welcome to my twisted cabaret
Where music touches me
When you're choosing
Keep shuffling
Because tune age beats suffering
'Cause music touches me
When you choose it
Keep shuffling
But don't lose it
Music touches me
When you're choosing
Keep shuffling
Because tune age beats suffering2Embed
