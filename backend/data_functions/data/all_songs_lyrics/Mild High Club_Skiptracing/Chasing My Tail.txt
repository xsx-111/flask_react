Chasing My Tail LyricsI'm acquiescing this phase
Weighing me down with its waiting
Playing my silly little game
Watching the memory I saved
Tossing all my coins (in wishing wells)
Searching for the signs (in parallel)
Out on the lawn I'll be skipping tracing
Chasing the person I seem
I'm readdressing my fate
Keeping a tab on my wasting
Playing my silly little game
Watching the memory I saved
Tossing all my coins (in wishing wells)
Searching for the signs (in parallel)
Out on the lawn I'll be skipping tracing
Chasing the person I seem1Embed
