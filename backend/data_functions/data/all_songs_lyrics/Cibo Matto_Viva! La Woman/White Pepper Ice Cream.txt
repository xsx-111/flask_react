White Pepper Ice Cream LyricsWhite pepper ice cream
It's like a line drawing
It snipped my heart
White pepper ice cream
In my mouth it sting my lips
It's like eclipse
As I'm in the crossword puzzle
But I can't fill in the blank
White pepper ice cream
Sweet or spicy?
White pepper ice cream
Ça m'est égal
Ça m'est égal
Which is the first word sweet or spicy?
Ça m'est égal
Ça m'est égal
Ça m'est égal
It's all the same to me
I was shot with bullets of pepper
On my lips, I feel a nip
Black and white, Bonnie and Clyde
Black and white, Bonnie and Clyde
It steels my sight
Under cover of night
We run away from...
It's all the same to me
We run away from...
It's all the same to me
