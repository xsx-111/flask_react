Know Your Chicken Lyrics
Sixteen years ago, one day
I was walking down the street
I was cruising in Brooklyn
You know what I mean?
Something was cooking
But wasn't yet a chicken
There was a man
Selling chicks in a box
He said, "two for one, but three for two,"
I said, "that's not bad
Here's money for you"
One was magenta
The other was blue

I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
One day, the blue one went away
The other grew up fucking well
She was noisy every night
I had always chicken bite
Then I met a lover
One night, she made me dinner
Licking finger, I wondered
Where she got the chicken
Then I met a lover
One night, she made me dinner
Licking finger, I wondered
Where she got the chicken

I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
 x4
Spare the rod and spoil the chick
Before you go and shit a brick

I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken

She went to college to study anatomy
I followed her father's butchery
We got two babies, is it cool?
One was magenta, the other was blue

I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chicken
I know my chicken
You got to know your chickenEmbed
