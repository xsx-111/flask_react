The Candy Man LyricsWho can take the sunlight, sprinkle it with dew
Cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two
The candy man, the candy man can
The candy man, the candy man can
He mixes it with love, makes the world taste good
Who can take the rainbow, wrap it in a sigh
Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie
The candy man, the candy man can
The candy man, the candy man can
He mixes it with love, makes the world taste good
The candy man makes everything he makes
Satisfying and delicious
Talking about your childhood for the wishes
You can even eat the dishes
But delicious
Who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream
The candy man, the candy man can
The candy man, the candy man can
He mixes it with love, makes the world taste good
The candy man, the candy man can
The candy man, the candy man can
He mixes it with love, makes the world taste good1Embed
