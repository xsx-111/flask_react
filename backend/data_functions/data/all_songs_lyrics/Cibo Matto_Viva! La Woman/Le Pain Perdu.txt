Le Pain Perdu LyricsThe sunshine, too light, the ocean, too wide
I'm sick of your clich√©
The sky is kind, love is blind
You can't let go of the lost pain
You're in the maze, spending every day
I'm in the haze, I want the getaway
You're in the maze, spending every day
I'm in the haze, I want the getaway
Can you take my silver wheat?
Mix it up with butter and treat
I feel a chill go down my feet
Your maple is so sweet
Can you take my silver wheat?
Mix it up with butter and treat
I feel a chill go down my feet
Your maple is so sweet, so sweet
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
Got to get me out of here before it goes stale
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
Got to get me out of here before it goes stale
Can you take my silver wheat?
Mix it up with butter and treat
I feel a chill go down my feet
Your maple is so sweet
Can you take my silver wheat?
Mix it up with butter and treat
I feel a chill go down my feet
Your maple is so sweet, so sweet
But it's too mushy, too mushy
I can't take it, baby
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
Got to get me out of here before it goes stale
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
We've got to get out, to get out the hell out
Got to get me out of here before it goes staleEmbed
