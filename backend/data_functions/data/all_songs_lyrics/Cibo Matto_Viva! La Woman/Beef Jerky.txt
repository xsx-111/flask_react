Beef Jerky LyricsMy weight is 300 pounds
My favorite is beef jerky
I'm a vagabond, I'm a vagabond
My mom says, "You are kinky"
Who cares? I don't care
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care
A horse's ass is better than yours
Lay down here, baby
Just relax, honey
My baby horse is Jennifer
What a beefy hip!
She has a fine coat of fur
What shiny hair!
Who cares? I don't care
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care
A horse's ass is better than yours
Let's eat carrots together until
Let's eat carrots together untilEmbed
