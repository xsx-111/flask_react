Mississippi Delta City Blues (Scratch Vocal Version) Lyrics
I've got a smile
That I put on
When I'm not at home
When I'm not alone
Oh, but it is so hard
To make that smile
Because I know I'll be at home
And alone in a while
And if I look in a mirror
I see my eyes start to tear
I can't help but cry
Since you said goodbye

Oh, I've got to hide
What I'm feeling inside
I can't let them know
'Cause you could hurt me so

I lost heart on the run
Won't let them see through
I won't let them know
That you could hurt me so, yeah, ooh
I've got a laugh
That I put on
When I'm not at home
When I'm not alone
And it's so hard
To fake that laugh
When my insides are crying
My heart's torn in half
The music I hear
And things I valued so dear
Make me feel so blue
All remind me of you

What can I do?
Our love is through
And my purpose is gone
But I must live on

I guess that's what I'll do
I won't let them see through
I won't let them know
That you could hurt me so
Yeah, come on, mhm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So that's what I'll do
Won't let them see through
I'll just keep hurting on
Until the hurt's all gone

You know 'cause I think 
And you're as fine as 
 that you'll do it all again
 or friend
So come on home, ooh, come on quick
Oh darling 
 oh hello, welcome home, hello
Come on home now
Come on home
Come on home
Come on home, please
Come on home
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
