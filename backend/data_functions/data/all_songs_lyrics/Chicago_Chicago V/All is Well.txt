All is Well Lyrics
All is well again
I think I'm gonna be alright
And I'm feeling better
Again

Loving you was sad
Affairs of timing that were bad
And the laughing ended
Again

There was a time
When I thought I was fooling myself
But now, I'll take a bow
'Cause I'm free and easy
Free and easy

All is well again
I think I'm gonna be alright
And I'm feeling better
Again

There was a time
When I thought I was fooling myself
But now, I'll take a bow
'Cause I'm free and easyEmbed
