6 Minutes of Pleasure Lyrics
Six minutes
Six minutes
I know why you're here
I ain't sayin' nothin'

Ayo, baby, I know why you're here
I know what you're doing
I can see it in your eyes, you're up to somethin'
I know what it is, but we're still cool
And we can socialize, I'm peepin' ya, baby
I'm holdin' back, I'm not lettin' go
'Cause a fool don't have a shoulder to cry on, so
Give me a kiss and you can sing this
Whether you like a mister or a miss

Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me (I know why you're here)
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I ain't sayin' nothin')
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I know why you're here)
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I ain't sayin' nothin')
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin'
Baby, you're my dear
I know why you're here, I know why you came
I know what you're thinkin', I know what you need
And that's what I've got, you think that I'm crazy
No, I'm not drinking, I know what you want
I made ya want it, take my hand
Listen to the man, you have a plan, don't even risk it
What do you want, a biscuit?

Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me (I know why you're here)
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I ain't sayin' nothin')
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I know why you're here)
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I ain't sayin' nothin')
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin'

Six minutes
Six minutes (Uh)
I ain't sayin' nothin' (Uh)
Six minutes (I know—)
Honey, I know what you're up to, I know how you're livin'
I know where you go when you leave my house
I know what your dreams are, but I dream too
You're with a man, you're not with a mouse
I see how you stare, I see how you smile
I see right through, now act like you knew
I know all about where you been runnin'
Wipe your feet before you come in

Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me (I know why you're here)
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I ain't sayin' nothin')
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I know why you're here)
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I ain't sayin' nothin')
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin'

Yeah, that's smooth
Let's just sit here and relax while my man plays the piano for us
Sip somethin' mellow
And discuss why you're here
But of course I ain't sayin' nothin'
Okay, now that you know
I know you know that I know you know
And that's the move, so sit right here
Whisper in my ear, caress my chest
And say somethin' smooth, but don't forget
I know what you'll say
Just what I thought, I know the routine
I know the routine, just what I thought
I know you tell the truth, I know you don't lie
Shh, close your eyes

Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me (I know why you're here)
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I ain't sayin' nothin')
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I know why you're here)
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I ain't sayin' nothin')
Ayo, baby, I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin'

I won't tell if you won't tell
It's cool with me, I know why you're here
I ain't sayin' nothin'
I know why you're here
I ain't sayin' nothin'
I know why you're here
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin'
I know why you're here, I ain't sayin' nothin'
I know you don't love me
I know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin'
I know why you're here, I ain't sayin' nothin'
I know you don't love me, but I ain't sayin' nothin'
I know why you're hereEmbed
