Round Here Buzz Lyrics
Another Friday night there's a line of cars leavin'
Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sittin' on the hood of mine drinkin'
I'm just a parkin' lot down-and-outer

Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on savin' me

Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and

Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz
I never had big-city eyes
Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace

No, Scotty's ain't got no vibe
Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight

Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz


Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down here
Is lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz
'Round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz3Embed
