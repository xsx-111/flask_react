Kill A Word Lyrics
If I could kill a word and watch it die
I'd poison "never," shoot "goodbye"
Beat "regret" when I felt I had the nerve
Yeah, I'd pound "fear" to a pile of sand
Choke "lonely" out with my bare hands
I'd hang "hate" so that it can't be heard
If I could only kill a word

I'd take "brokeness" out back
And break "heartbreak," stand there and laugh
Right in its face while shootin' it the bird
I'd put "upset" down in its place
I'd squeeze the life out of "disgrace"
Lay "over" under six cold feet of dirt
If I could only kill a word

Give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn "lies" and "hate" to "love" and "truth"
If I could only kill a word
I'd knock out "temptation"'s teeth
I'd sever "evil," let it bleed
Then light up "wicked," stand and watch it burn
I'd take "vice" and I'd take "vile"
Tie 'em up there with "hostile"
Hang 'em high and leave 'em for the birds
If I could only kill a word

So give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn "lies" and "hate" to "love" and "truth"
If I could only kill a word
If I could only kill a word6Embed
