Forget Lyrics
Hack off for you, you felt for you
What name for thee other than thee?
Reduced to bone, reduced to dust
Cross out the dawn, could not enough
Un-beautiful, pale of the sun
Undignified, but it goes on

Forget!
Forget!
Forget!
Forget!
Forget!
Forget!
Forget!
Forget!

Oh, forget who you are
Don't admit who you are
Oh, forget who you are
Don't admit who you are
Oh, to take and to touch
And for once feel good
Oh, to take and to touch
And for once feel good
Was it wrong? but said and done
With great relief, rip out the dawn
To drink the drink hung from a chord
Un-beautiful, hung from a chord

(Planet rock) Forget!
(Planet blush) Forget!
(Planet pure filth) Forget!
(Planet gigolette) Forget!
(Planet rock) Forget!
(Planet blush) Forget!
(Planet David Horvitz) Forget!

You are to be named The Cigar
You are to be called Candy Barr
You are to be named Hanky John
Undignified, as it goes on
