At Last, At Last Lyrics
Go away, go far away
Don't ever talk to me
Oh, run away
Heaven's call will never be for thee

Oh, sorry you had to see it
Born dead
It has to be this way
Born dead
Night is coming
Sorry it could be this way

At last, at last
It's come undone
Oh angel, afraid to feel it
(To want it)
Fear not, the day is done

To look at her
You are ashamed
Now look up to the sky
Oh, to be free
To be alone
To be alone all the time
Oh, sorry you had to see it
Born dead
It has to be this way
Born dead
Night is coming
Sorry it could be this way

At last, at last
It's come undone
Oh angel, afraid to feel it
(To want it)
Fear not, the day is doneEmbed
