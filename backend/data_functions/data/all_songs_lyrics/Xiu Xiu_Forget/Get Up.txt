Get Up Lyrics
A piano fell on my face
You told me to get up
When I could not control myself
You said to get up
Consciousness demolished
When I tried to hold the pain inside
You say to hold it in

Love me forever
Don't forget me
It's late in the game to ask
But I'm still asking

A harmonica fell on my face
It did not hurt that much
If you leave no one will find my corpse
You said
Rise from the dead!
Sometimes a person cannot help what they do
You mumble to get up
Operating now without belief
You say sh sh sh
And to get up
Do you hate me
Because I seem so stupid?
Or do you just very quickly
Hate me right back?

During the rape of everything decent
The flickering flames impressed me
A saxophone fell on my face
How is a mystery
When I am shocked
By my own foolishness
You say you are not as shocked
When I repeat that I am shocked by my own foolishness
You get up and leave the room

Love me forever
Don't forget me
It's late in the game to ask
But I'm still asking you

You're the only reason I was born
You're the only reason I was born
