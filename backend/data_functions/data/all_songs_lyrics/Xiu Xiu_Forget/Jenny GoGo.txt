Jenny GoGo Lyrics
Too dumb to be this dumb
Too young to be this young
Don't do too much

GoGo

Too glum to be a chum
Too brute to be so cute
What have I done?

GoGo

Too ding to be a bat
Too fat to be so bad
Take me instead

GoGo

Too tight to be so tight
Too wrong to be this wrong
Don't say hello
GoGo

Maybe a bunny
A hubby inside me
Dummy baby

Jenny! Jenny!
WHOA!
Jenny! Jenny!

Too dead to be this dumb
Too dead to be this young
Sing me to sleep

GoGo

Too dig to be a dug
Too bear to be a rug
What have I done?
GoGo
Crazy, crummy
A funny inside me
Fussy baby

Jenny! Jenny!
WHOA!
Jenny! Jenny!
Jenny! Jenny! (GoGo)
Jenny! WHOA! (GoGo)
Jenny! Jenny! (GoGo)
Jenny! WHOA! (GoGo)2Embed
