Queen of the Losers Lyrics
Barely wear enough
To pad a crutch
Your face is made up
For taking a punch
I want to eat it and I will not wait

Everyone loves you
Pain has just begun
Everyone hates you
Pain has just begun
Everyone loves you
Pain has just begun
Everyone hates you
Pain has just begun

Rough and ready to be never awake
How do you feel?
I say pretty OK
Queen of the Losers
Take it, take it away!

Everyone loves you
Pain has just begun
Everyone hates you
Pain has just begun
Everyone loves you
Pain has just begun
Everyone hates you
Pain has just begun
What's your name?
Fuckin' nothing
What's your name?
Fuckin' nothing
What's your name?
Fuckin' nothing1Embed
