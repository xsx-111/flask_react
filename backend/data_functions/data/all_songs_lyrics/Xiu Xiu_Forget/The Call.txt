The Call Lyrics
You want to see it
You want to tick it
You want to lick it
Want to kiss it
Want to whisper in my ear bitch?
But I don't give a fuck girl
Because you gave me a thousand bucks

Ask can one un-ring a bell
(A mutiny and you from me)
Plink upon a clavinet
(The exotic sounds of BLAHhHh)
Always feeling like I knew
(Who you were you but, never what)

Just for once, come to me
When looking for what means the most
Just for once, come to me
When looking for what means, oh oh oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hang up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Clap, bitches
Clap, bitches
Clap, bitches
Clap, bitches)

Denounce yourself and walk the street
(A private and a boring dream)
Don't ask yourself if it isn't true
(And wet your everything with cream)
Kill the hippies, kill yourself
(How you would but, never why)

Just for once, come to me
When looking for what means the most
Just for once, come to me
When looking for what means, oh oh oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hang up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I call out your name in the night
I call out your name in the night
And with certainty you are worthless
And with certainty you are worthless
(Clap bitches, clap clap clap, bitches, clap
Clap bitches, clap clap clap, bitches, clap)

(Why why why, bitch, why why, cunt, why
Why why why why why why
Clap bitches)2Embed
