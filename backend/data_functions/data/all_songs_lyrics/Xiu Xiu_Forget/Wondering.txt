Wondering Lyrics
Tonite is anything
Goodbye to anything
Outside of anything
Collide with everything

Ring a dong ding ding
Down on your knees
Ring a ding ding ding
Swallow defeat
Ring-a ding-a ding
Ding ding dong ding

Wondering, maybe?
Wondering, maybe?
Wondering, maybe?
Wondering
Wondering

There's not a chance, there's never been
Destroyed by color on the wind
It is so clear it is so clean
And unforgivably obscene
Alive is anything
Alight to anything
Denied of anything
Surprised with everything

Oh, love was stronger then
Life went on without an end
Now to feel the sun
Burn our rights and wrongs
The shock of ash upon hope and peace

There's not a dance that's never been
Jealous of envy on the wind
It is plain, it is so pure
And unforgivably obscure

Wondering, maybe?
Wondering, maybe?
Wondering, maybe?
Wondering
