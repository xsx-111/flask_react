El Espectro LyricsIn the desert with you
Away from your parents and casa so grande
Under the gaze of El Espectro
Is the safest place we have to go
Go! Go!

Rumors of Blanco Morte
A lurking desert menace
Gnawing on gringo bones
My love for you steals my fear
Damned for our fathers' sins
We might die in the chaparral
By the boney hand
The boney hand of El Espectro

El Espectro please don't show yourself
The still night air is heavy on my skin
Oh lovely Aztec temptress
No sacrifice again
No, no sacrifice again
