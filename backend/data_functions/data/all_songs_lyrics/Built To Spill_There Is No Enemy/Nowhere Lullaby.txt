Nowhere Lullaby Lyrics
Well, the stakes of the game seemed fine
Until you lost after this time
Has to make you cry
But you don't and you don't know why
Trying not to solve this
Doesn't mean it's not that bad
And everyone gets through the night
And everyone wakes up alright
And the fear you feel will pass
Then a calmness that will last
We will learn to drift off fast

Another nowhere lullaby
You can rest or you can try
And this waste, it shines in every way
Yeah, this waste, it shines in every way

You make me laugh every single day
And you hardly make me cry
Made fifteen years fly by
Still here and I don't know why
Has it been that long?
Where's the time and the table gone?
Hope it's longer than that now
Don't forget we don't know how
And everyone gets feeling down
Everybody understands
We're all doing what we can
Another nowhere lullaby
You can rest or you can try
And this waste, it shines in every way
Yeah, this waste, it shines in every wayEmbed
