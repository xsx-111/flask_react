Pat Lyrics
Pat, we need your brains back
Pat, we need your fire and your imagination
Pat, we know you fucked up
But we don't care you fucked up, everybody's fucked up

Thought I heard your voice the other night
And sure enough, it came from you
Thought I'd be surprised that you weren't dead
But all I was was glad

Just sitting by your bed
And talking to your head
And hearing what you said
As if you'd never left

Can't you see yourself yet, can't you see through our eyes?
Can't you see the truth?
Nothing's worse than ever, falling in a dream's where
We can see each other

Saw you the other night
Have to say something wasn't right
Of course, but I didn't mind
Cause seeing you being all alive
Just walking in the room made me so relieved
Like everything was fine and you had never died
Or second-guessed your mind or gave up on our trust
Thought you'd gone too far for us to take you back
But distances like that, Pat, don't exist in fact3Embed
