Done Lyrics
Loneliness is getting hard to perceive
Seems it never comes or it never leaves
Every day we step into some deceit
This should bring the ill-defined to their feet

It's forgiven, it's all for you
All your problems will come true
Said it once, I'll say it once again
This won't make you happy

All I want is you to make up your mind
To come on down and linger here for a while
All I know is what I wanted to say
Disappeared and has yet to be replaced

It's forgiven, it's for you
All your problems will come true
It's already done, it's already done
It's already doneEmbed
