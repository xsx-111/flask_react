Things Fall Apart Lyrics
Came into the darkness from out of the blue
I don't know much but I know what to do
Froze in my mind, I believed it so long
Alright, I'll admit I was wrong

Stay out of my nightmares, stay out of my dreams
You're not even welcome in my memories
When things are alright and I want what I've got
It's only momentarily thought
Fade out, fade out

If no one thinks of no one
Then no one believes in no one
And no one fucks with no one
When no one's afraid of no one

We've all seen enough, now it's time to decide
The meekness of love or the power of pride
It doesn't matter if you're good or smart
Goddamn it, things fall apart
Let's go for a walk, yeah, let's go for a drive
Don't know how to say thanks for being alive
Let's go for a lifetime, let's go for a fling
Don't know how to say anythingEmbed
