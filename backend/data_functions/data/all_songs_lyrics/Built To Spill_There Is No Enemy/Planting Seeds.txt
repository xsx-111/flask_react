Planting Seeds Lyrics
I'd hand it to time
If I knew where the time had gone
The connoisseurs were wrong
And so was everyone else
I know what they're saying
Cause that's all they talk about
Just need to figure out
Some shit for myself
And just because it's obvious
Doesn't mean it's even true
Heard it all and I believe that we deserve another
Point of view

We can make it if we try
And if we don't, it's going to still be alright
Cause our minds are still alive
And we can decide what's right

Make up your mind
Make up your own mythology
Afraid of finding me
And of defining you
Take what you want
But you won't want it where you're at
I know this for a fact
Just because it's so true
The first place my mind goes
Is where I never want it to
Like where it hurts the most of all
The stupid shit I say and do

We can make it if we try
And if we don't, it's going to still be alright
Cause our minds are still alive
And we can decide what's right

Telling me thousands of times what's next to want
Just doing their job but you know that's a dirty job
Can't stand this game, still we're bullied to play along
When bullies grow up, they get meaner, yeah, they really get it down
They think that they get it
But they always get it wrong
They'll play your favorite song
Just to sell shit to you
I've heard that they'll sell anything
And I think they might
I think Bill Hicks was right
About what they should do

And just because you love something doesn't mean it's yours to buy
Been selling it so long that no one even knows the reason why
You've been messing with our minds
Getting rich wasting our timeEmbed
