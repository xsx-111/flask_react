Tomorrow Lyrics
Waiting for our answers
This cancer's common as sand
What happens here stays here
Cause no one anywhere else gives a damn
All said and done, who's going to bother remembering?
All dead and gone
Like anyone assuming
They know what makes us tick
I was just as wrong as I could be
Only knowing that explained a lot

The more you have to live for
The more you love your life
The harder it will be for you to die
And we all want living and dying easy

Feels like eternity but it's just one lifetime
How can a love that unforbidden be so strong?
There's something wrong with me
I try to forget 
But my memory won't fail me now
It's wonderful and scary
Knowing what's alive
A tree, a rock, a turtle or a thought
That's what makes me want to never die
At least we have tomorrow
If we have tomorrow
Tomorrow's just a day beyond today
If tomorrow comes tomorrow

Feels like eternity but it's just one lifetime
How can a love that unforbidden be so strong?
There's something wrong with me
I try to forget

I try to forget1Embed
