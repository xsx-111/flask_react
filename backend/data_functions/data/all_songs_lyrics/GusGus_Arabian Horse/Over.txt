Over LyricsWe have made our mistakes over
We have gone up and down over and over
Once again I have crossed, double-crossed over
I betrayed our trust, knocked it all over
Over, over, over, over
And I wonder why, why we didn't try this time
Didn't even try, try to make things right over
(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, we didn't try this time) Over
(We didn't even try, try to make things right) Make me
(This time) Over
(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, didn't try this time) Make me over
(We didn't even try, try to make things right) Make me
(This time) Over(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, we didn't try this time)
(We didn't even try, try to make things right) We didn't try
(This time) Over
With the wind, this will blow, it will blow over
Is the time, the time to mend over?
Maybe we can delve deep into ourselves over
Find the smallest flame, restart the game over
Over, over, make me over, make me over, over
(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, we didn't try this time)
(We didn't even try, try to make things right this time)
(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, we didn't try this time) Over
(We didn't even try, try to make things right) Make me
(This time) Over(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, didn't try this time)
Make me over (We didn't even try, try to make things right)
Make me (This time) Over
We didn't try over, over, over, over, over
(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, we didn't try this time)
(We didn't even try, try to make things right this time)Embed
