Arabian Horse LyricsDisappear, in to the dust
Lost on your horse
Blown away, by your gust
Lost on your horse
Doesn't laugh under the sun
Lost on your horse
Like the brain of sad
Lost in your storm
And the crossroads take a left
Lost on your - horse
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Ridin' on, getting lost
Lost on your horse
Disappear, in to the dust
Lost on your horse
Racing on the desert dunes
I'd chase you like the moon
But when the crossroads take a left
Lost on your - horse
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see
Too bright to even see
Too bright - too bright
More and more - in my eyes
Too bright too even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright too even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright too even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright too even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyesEmbed
