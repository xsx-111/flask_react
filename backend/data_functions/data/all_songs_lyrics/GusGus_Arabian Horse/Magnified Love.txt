Magnified Love LyricsI'm done for
I give up
Surrender my physical mood
You make me walk blindly
Right out of my comforthood
You stroke me
You strike me
As someone who is in control
You eat me
You feed me
You nourish my hungry soul
Hungry soul
Oh my, oh my, oh my magnified love
You push me
You shove me
You move me every minute
You move me
You shove me
You move every cell in my body
In my body
You own me
Physically
Possessing me spiritually
Oh my, oh my, oh my magnified loveEmbed
