Be With Me LyricsI'm lying in my bed now
And it feels just like a prison cell
I'm trying to get sleep
With my head stuck in a vacuum shell
And I want you to be here
From the bottom of a wishing well
Be with me now
I'm turning in my bed
And my mind twists like a whirlwind hell
I'm rolling in my bed
Wrapped up in your binding spell
Be with me nowEmbed
