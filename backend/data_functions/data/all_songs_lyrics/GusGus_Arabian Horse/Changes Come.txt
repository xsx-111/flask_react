Changes Come LyricsMaybe I just want to be alone
Tired of searching for the way back home
Stuck in the state of no state at the deep end of sorrow
Changes come, but I can't follow
Stay, stay, stay, stay away
Touched by evil, nothing more to say
(Changes come, and I can't follow)
It's so easy to turn you on
But just as quickly then you're gone
Stuck in this state of no fate with sight fixed on tomorrow
Changes come, and you do follow
Stay, stay, stay, stay away
Touched by evil, nothing more to sayEmbed
