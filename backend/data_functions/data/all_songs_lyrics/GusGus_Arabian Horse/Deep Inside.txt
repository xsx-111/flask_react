Deep Inside Lyrics
When you opened my heart I was thrown
Deep into the Milky Way
The adrenaline rush that I got from the crush blew me away
Opened doors, opened wide, deep inside
You rose in a certain way
I could feel how you grew and I knew
You would steal my heart away

Deep inside, deep inside
Why did you just steal my heart and go
Deep inside, deep and tight
My teeth are sore on your front door
I'm dry, I'm dry, I'm dry, I'm dry
Deep inside the Milky Way

Now I'm pushed and I'm pulled
I feel flushed
I'm completely out of place
And the blood that was boiling with lust
Now is frozen in my veins
I am stuck in a rut with the thought
When my life was swept away
How cathartic when my heart exploded
Inside the Milky Way
Deep inside, deep inside
Why did you just steal my heart and go
Deep inside, deep and tight
My teeth are sore on your front door
I'm dry, I'm dry, I'm dry, I'm dry
Deep inside the Milky WayEmbed
