The Incident Lyrics
Get demolished
Get demolished
Get demolished
You get demolished
Get demolished
Get demolished
Get demolished
You get demolished

At junction eight the traffic starts to slow
Artilleries of braking lights and bluish glow
Ascending in a plumage of twisted steel
Shattered glass and confetti dashed upon the wheel

Get demolished
Get demolished
Get demolished
You get demolished
Get demolished
Get demolished
Get demolished
You get demolished
When a car crash gets you off you've lost your grip
When a fuck is not enough you know you've slipped
When a church is full it means you've just been had
When the world has gone to seed you're so detached

Get demolished
Get demolished
Get demolished
You get demolished
Get demolished
Get demolished
Get demolished
You get demolished

Got a feeling that I want you to be there
Got a feeling that I want you to be
Got a feeling that I want you to be there
Got a feeling that I want you to be there
Got a feeling that I want you to be
Got a feeling that I want you to be there
Got a feeling that I want you to be there
Got a feeling that I want you to be
Got a feeling that I want you to be there
Got a feeling that I want you to be there
Got a feeling that I want you to be
Got a feeling that I want you to be there
Driving by on my way to somewhere else
I fill my lungs with a noxious burning smell
There is weed and grey concrete like this for miles
Dead souls in my rear view mirror hitch a ride a while

I want to be loved
Just want to be loved
I want to be loved
Just want to be loved
I want to be loved
Just want to be loved
I want to be loved
Just want to be loved
I want to be loved
Just want to be loved
I want to be loved
Just want to be loved1Embed
