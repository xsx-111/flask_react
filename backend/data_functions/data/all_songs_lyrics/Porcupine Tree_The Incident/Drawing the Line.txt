Drawing the Line Lyrics
Camphor crossed with lace it is the witching hour
Cinematic but crude
Teasing all my feelings out you move away
It seems so natural to you
Still the siren climbing up her victory tower
Like there's something left to prove
I trap the beads of sweat that run between my eyes
And free the fever to move

I'm drawing the line, I'm drawing the line
I'm drawing the line, I draw the line
And I have my pride
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
And I save my soul
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
And I have no doubt

Dreamt the sound of scissors cutting stitches out
Then discarding the used
Recording all my problems onto memory cards
Your compassion unmoved
Unto others what they always do to you
The most twisted of your rules
Distill malaise and photograph the hole it leaves
Running out a copy for you
I'm drawing the line, I'm drawing the line
I'm drawing the line, I draw the line
And I have my pride
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
And I save my soul
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
And I have no doubt
I'm drawing the line, I'm drawing the line
I'm drawing the line, I draw the line
And I have my pride
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
And I save my soul2Embed
