Octane Twisted Lyrics
We go following sorrow to free your
Blood spilling out of the reeds there
Give me a sign I can breathe air
Blood flowing out of the stream there
Following sorrow to free your (Give me something new please)
Blood spilling out of the reeds there (Something I can love)
Give me a sign I can breathe air (Give me something new please)
Blood flowing out of the stream there (Something I can love)2Embed
