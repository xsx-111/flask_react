Remember Me Lover Lyrics
I didn't want to feel like a slave to your mood swings
And I'm not saying anything I wouldn't say behind your back
And all this shit could have happened to anyone
All that matters now is how you gonna pick it up to throw it back

It's so hard
To get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too
I hated you
I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut

I never meant to start anything that I couldn't finish
Now I gotta be the one to turn away, it's time to react
I meant every word that I said, yeah I really did
But you gotta understand that I was sleeping then
So relax

I walked away, now remember me lover
I told you lies, now remember me lover
I took your money, remember me lover
I ruined your life, now remember me lover
It's so hard
To get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too
I hated you
I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut
(Ah, ah)

I've been through this with you about a hundred times
Agree to disagree, and start again with our lives
Then every single morning I wake up and you're still there
But tomorrow you will be alone and that is all you deserve

I walked away, now remember me lover
I told you lies, now remember me lover
I took your money, remember me lover
I ruined your life, now remember me lover

It's so hard
To get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too
I hated you
I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut
(Ah, ah)
