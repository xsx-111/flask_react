Time Flies Lyrics
I was born in '67
The year of "Sgt. Pepper"
And "Are You Experienced"
Into a suburban heaven
Yeah it should've been forever
It all seems to make so much sense

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
Cause time flies

She said luck is what you make it
You just reach out and take it
Now let's dance a while
She said nothing ever happens
If you don't make it happen
And if you can't laugh and smile

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
Cause time flies
And laughing in the summer showers
That's still the way I see you now

How does time break down
With no marker, things slow down
A conference of the strange
And your family is deranged

I could tell you what I'm thinking
While we sit here drinking
But I'm not sure where to start
You see there's something wrong here
I'm sorry if I'm not clear
Can you stop smoking your cigar

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
Cause time flies
And the coat you wore to Alton Towers
Is still the way I see you now6Embed
