Flicker Lyrics
Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will stare at us
Merely a flicker of the light to come
Only the people who always think they know best

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will stare at us
Merely a flicker of the light to come
Only the people who always think they know bestEmbed
