The Blind House Lyrics
If you wanna stay
Always here
All these years
A last frontier
It's no concern of theirs
The world outside
Corrupts my child
So trust these eyes

Faith is in your soul
Within these walls
Hormones stall
Dogs will crawl
The vices and the doubts
We resist
All this shit
So kneel submit

Free love
Free love
Bring love to all my sisters
Breathe out
Blind house
You don't need to know their secrets
Believe me
Pray and violate
Abuse your trust
False gods must
Purge their lust
A family that lies
To seal your fate
To take the weight
Of their self-hate

Free love
Free love
Bring love to all my sisters
Breathe out
Blind house
Free love
Feel loved
Breathe out
Blind house
Free love
Feel loved1Embed
