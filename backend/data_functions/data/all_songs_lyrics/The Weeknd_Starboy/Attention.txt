Attention Lyrics
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Baby, you were so strong
Baby, you were calm, you were so calm, yeah
Tell me where it went wrong
Tell me how to love, it's been so long
When a call's not enough, yeah
And you just need to touch
Thinkin' twice I'm the one, yeah
But you just need to trust

You're only lookin' for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh, babe
You're only lookin' for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh woah

What do you expect now?
Only thing left is the sex now
'Cause baby too vexed now
Only see me on the TV or the bed now
When a touch not enough, yeah
You were more than a fuck
Thinkin' twice I'm the one
But you just need to trust
You're only lookin' for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh, babe
You're only lookin' for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh woah
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, attention
Ooh, ooh (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ooh (Love all the attention, baby), attention (Love all the attention)

You're only lookin' for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh, babe
You're only lookin' for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh woah, yeah

Oh, oh (Yeah), oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh, oh (Yeah), oh, oh18Embed
