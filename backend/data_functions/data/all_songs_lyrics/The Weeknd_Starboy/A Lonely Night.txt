A Lonely Night Lyrics
Gassed up, yeah, yeah
Hey
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, hey

Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us?
There's nothin' between us, oh, ayy, ayy
Why would you wanna use a life to keep us?
To keep us together, oh woah, oh

Better when we're both apart (Oh)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other
No good for each other
Better when we're both apart (My baby)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh
It was the only time
And if I led you on, then I apologize
How can I make you rethink your decision?
Unruly decision, oh woah, hey (Oh)
What's gonna make you rethink your position?
I know your intentions (I know your intentions), oh woah, oh, hey

Better when we're both apart (Oh)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other
No good for each other (No good for each other)
Better when we're both apart (My baby)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh (Ooh woah)
It was the only time
And if I led you on, then I apologize, oh (I apologize)

(Let's go)
Better when we're both apart (I'll be)
Better when we're both apart (Oh)
We're no good for each other
No good for each other
Better when we're both apart (Oh, baby)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, hey
Woo
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, oh, ho

A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh (Hey)
It was the only time (It was the only time)
And if I led you on, then I apologize, oh (Apologize, woah)
A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh (Ooh woah)
It was the only time
And if I led you on, then I apologize, oh (Oh)

Baby girl, I loved you
You know I loved you
Know I loved you
Hey, no-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no, ayy22Embed
