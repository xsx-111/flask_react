Shoulder LyricsIn the flesh
You got me high
You got me high
I feel your heartbeat still all night
That boy
You want the one thing
You're a beautiful panther
Inside your bedroom
Outside we killed
I fell upside down when you crossed me
How are you
I'm feeling fine
Except you got me high that I can't sleep at night
You want the one thing
You're a beautiful slider
You pitch your fastball straight from your shoulder
You want the one thing
You're a beautiful panther
No one can strike me like you do
So do I do to youEmbed
