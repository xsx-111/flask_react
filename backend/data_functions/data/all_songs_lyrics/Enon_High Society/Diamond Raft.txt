Diamond Raft LyricsThe clouds all look the same
Inside their picture frames
And every other day
That ever went or came
The river's turning black
And never turning back
The travel boat and train
Dragging the ball and chain
They weathered salt and rain
Then drifted down the drain
The little diamond raft
Is never floating backEmbed
