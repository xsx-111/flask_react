Sold! LyricsThey're giving praise
Before an itchy trigger
That aims to plug into your energy
By means of crunching up
Some numbered figures
And hope you choose
From the names that get bought in a row
Doesn't work anymore
It doesn't make it alright
You're just a name on the shelf
And the colors amaze
But they don't cover the lies
Let's put some change into a broken meter
Let's make a sickness with the remedy
A hint of mint and then there's no more flavor
Another bruise on the bulletin nose
It doesn't hurt anymore
It doesn't make it alright
You're just a name on the shelf
And the colors amaze
But they don't cover the lies
I get sold
It doesn't hurt anymore
It doesn't mean it was right
You're just a name on the shelf
And the colors amaze
But they don't cover the lies
And you know I get sold;
It doesn't hurt anymore
It doesn't mean it was right
You're just a name on the shelf
And the colors amaze
But they don't cover the lies
I can't remember the name, but I'm sold!
It doesn't hurt anymore
It doesn't mean it was right
You're just a name on the shelf
And the colors amaze
But they don't cover the liesEmbed
