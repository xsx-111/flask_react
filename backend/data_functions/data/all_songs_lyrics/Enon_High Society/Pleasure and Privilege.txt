Pleasure and Privilege LyricsX-ray x-ray
Outcome outcome
Can't do with us again oh yeah
Now when you get under the settle with action action
You're through with us again
No no you never wanna answer your phone call phone call
Nobody else will see that you're old school old school
Get an x-ray
The outcome out
Your middle finger's in the air
Oh yeah now you can breathe it in
Next page, new wave
Soul spot, cold heart
To clip around the thing cuz you care
Go with the pleasure and the privilege
The satisfaction
You're through with us again
You gotta get under the settle with action action
You're never just as common as chain reaction
Get an x-ray
The outcome you'll know
The interest isn't there all together
To light it in again
No money for the rude baby
But give a dog a bone
Your feather's full of true daddy
Your little misses home
Come on
To some of us our sin is enough
Too much to think about it
We wanna hiccup in how we wanna shake it
Dream a little dream and give up
That's what you're all about
The money tip the scale
Can't do with us again oh yeah
You're through with us again
Can't do with us again oh well
Your middle finger's in the air1Embed
