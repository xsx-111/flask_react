Disposable Parts LyricsIn the flesh
Instant cash
Something great
To sit on the shelf
From the things that I want to do
I will shape and then forget about you
And in my pocket I can keep you
Put you away for another day
To find you every time I need you
Throw you away when the flavor goes out
You can take your adoration and your tin little heart
You will never get to take me with disposable parts
You can waste your adoration and your tin little heart
You will never get to take me with disposable parts
In a dress
To caress
Then you taste
And let it go to waste
In your face
Pure grace
Be replaced
With something else behind you
And in my pocket I can keep you
Put you away for another day
To find you every time I need you
Throw you away when the flavor goes out
You can take your adoration and your tin little heart
You will never get to take me with disposable parts
You can take your adoration and your tin little heart
You will never get to take me with disposable parts
You can take your adoration and your tin little heart
You will never get to take me with disposable parts
You can take your adoration and your tin little heart
You will never get to take me with disposable partsEmbed
