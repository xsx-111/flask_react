Natural Disasters LyricsThe natural disasters make it hard to mind
Birthday cake, steak and wine
The rope around the carpet make you bust a dime
They want your heart to ache and take up all your time
The broken situations that leave no resort
Must give way to play and sport
Don't want to think about it, don't know what to say
So sorry that you're crossâ€”goodbye to you today
We've got to cut the conversation keep it clean and dry
And if they never finish then we won't ask why
It's just a natural disaster that you've left behind
For the cuts of cake; for the steak and wine
We'll cut the conversation keep it clean and dry
And if they never finish then we won't ask why
It's just a natural disaster that you've left behind
For the cuts of cake; for the steak and wine
No more emotions to show nobody has to know
It's just a natural disaster that you've left behind
For the cuts of cake; for the steak and wine
We'll cut the conversation keep it clean and dry
But if they never finish then we won't ask why
It's just a natural disaster that you've left behind
For the cuts of cake, and for the steak and wine
No more emotions to show nobody has to know
It's just a natural disaster that you've left behind
For the cuts of cake; for the steak and wineEmbed
