Leave It to Rust LyricsStep into the office
Doing business when they can
A crack in the glue three could fall into
Pull the lever in advance
A look without a view
A look without a view
A mirror and a broom
A hope that I pursue
____ off your compass
For your graceful cult
And let us blow your trumpets
So we can swear that it's not our fault
I look in the mirror; I don't know, but know this:
Stop in for a visit that never came
The entrance to you that I've never been through
And leave it to rust in the rain
The Brokehouse gambler's spade was gone
Dealing twos and threes
Make a lifetime plan with a farmer's tan
Steal a bit from an entrance fees
A look without a view
A look without a view
A mirror and a broom
A hope that I pursue
I look in the mirror; I don't know, but know this:
Stop in for a visit that never came
The entrance to you that I've never been through
And leave it to rust in the rain
Come visit ____ casino maybe down at Reno (?)
_____ that I knew you I'm looking right through you
Come visit our casino Vegas and Reno
The chips that I blew through; I'm looking right through you
I look in the mirror; I don't know, but know this:
Stop in for a visit that never came
The entrace to you that I've never been through
And leave it to rust in the rain
And leave it to rust in the rain
And leave it to rust in the rainEmbed
