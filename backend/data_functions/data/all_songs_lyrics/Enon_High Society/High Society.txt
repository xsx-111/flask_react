High Society LyricsIt can be lonely up at the top
Above your problems and your stress
And if there's trouble then we will take a pill
To find a High Society
Up in the air with your poverty
And on the way to a Broadway play
She bought whatever was in her way
She got her hair done there on
Crosby and Prince a shave and a rinse
Just for her High Society
She bought her High Society
Aah, life's much richer than the sound
I feel us going up, the others going down and down
This world is full of filthy sights
I won't go out at night
Unless the corners there are bright
In light of High Society
She bought her High Society
Just for her High Society
She took her way like a magistrate
She bought whatever was in her way
And paid for dinner
With 200 dollar bills what a thrill
To eat her High Society
She bought her High Society
Aah, life's much richer than the sound
I feel us going up, the others going down and down
This world is full of filthy sights
I won't go out at night
Unless the corners there are bright
In light of High Society
She bought her High Society
Just for her High SocietyEmbed
