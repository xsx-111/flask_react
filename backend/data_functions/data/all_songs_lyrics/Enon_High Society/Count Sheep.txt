Count Sheep LyricsShe's got to lower her sail
Too bad the winds got in her way
Tideâ€™s changing up ahead
So cut off your ears at east of issues
This conversation's done
We've covered heads she's covered tails
She's cut off her conscience on
Deep in your head and you're still crying
But you don't have the right
You take sides and spill it if to save from the spite
From the roll of the honor and a gluttonous heap
You would use the whole barn up and you love to count sheep
So count sheep
This diamond's not for sale
With big advertisements in our heads
One lie won't tip the scale
For rich little beggars making big bets
They're out to mark the score
Fat cats away dead mice decay
Recouching on the course
Awake in the bed and lay there crying
But you don't have the right
Go on open your feeder for another big bite
You run all kinds of red lights except the ones on the street
When you run out of exits you can always count sheep
So count sheepEmbed
