In This City LyricsI have been listening, such an ancient song
My eyes are closed but I never sleep
I felt transparent and saw that lash on your eyes
You waved me twice on over to my seas
We found ourselves none in this city
You said our song's cruel, it sounds hissy
Brand food is ruling my sanity
Scream to your entrance
I felt simply in
Night lights are swayed on
I prayed for death
Circle and turn around
A closer sky
My name, feel, feel, and feel all tight
My name, feel, feel, your love was right
I lip sync, have to pretend to conversation-sigh
You didn't know how, you've never even tried
Attraction leeches, but never ever dies
We're leaving next week, behind your risky eyes
We found ourselves none in this city
You said our song's cruel, it sounds hissy
Night lights are swayed on
I prayed for death
Circle and turn around
A closer sky
We found ourselves none in this city
You said our song's cruel, it sounds hissy
Circle, circle and turn around
The little white lies won't make a sound
Circle, circle and turn around
A closer sky
We found ourselves none in this city
You said our song's cruel, it sounds hissyEmbed
