Native Numb LyricsThe words get love and the words get sliced
Don't make the first dried least and the brand new course
Well let's go back to where we started from
A story with a trail of crumbs
I was stellar then today
Don't make up the evidence
Don't go to waste
Let's start we'll travel into the weekend home
The times are wicked with the native numb
Generation feel OK
To your prison
To a Bordeaux
So say OK
The century's over
Pay up, you know you're stayin'
The boys are gonna
There's no one to blame
Statistics honor
Attentions are overrated
They're either buyin'
Gimme gimme that thing
The words get love and the words get sliced
Don't make the first dried least and the brand new course
She's spurting adult with the blood and gore
It's like she's speaking from an open sore
Cancelling communicate
She's a double-wire-crosser
Another broken cup-and-saucer
With a kiss and disarray
Split it like a razor
It'll be on the way
It doesn't matter
Sink it, you'll never save it
The boys are gonna
There's no one to blame
Correct your armor
Save it, but don't mistake it
There is a motto
Baby baby don't you bring me no shame
The phone rings but you won't get throughEmbed
