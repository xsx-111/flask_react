Window Display LyricsRiding a ball and chain with a mirror on the floor
Amnesia and fragrance can't remember what it's for
But she knows her instincts are just other words for fun
Let in the shade when there's no sun
I bought a window display and married her at once
I broke the remote control and she hasn't talked for months
Look at the inlay the detail matters much
She'll throw the dogs a bone and it makes a mighty crunch
The best pictures were taken there's some more upon the floor
Taken on vacation on a hillside by the shore
But she's not a magazine you're reading every month
And defintitely not the girl next door
Everything you wanted I'd want more
Took back the display the details scratched a lot
Her golden tooth decay and the halitosis rot
So much for history the display left her mark
Go find her another home where the other dogs can bark
I bought a window display and married her at once
I broke the remote control and she hasn't talked for months
Look at the inlay the detail matters much
She's throwing the dogs a bone and it makes a mighty crunchEmbed
