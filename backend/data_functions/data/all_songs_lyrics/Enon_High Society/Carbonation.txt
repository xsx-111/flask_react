Carbonation LyricsAre you feeling a flash?
Does it feel like a rash?
Is there a stupid dance
Coming from in your pants?
You're getting nearer to love
No time to fold your hands
You gotta take a chance
On your romance
This business carbonation
Less pop more fizz
Coming over on the radio station
It's killing us kids
Come get your everything in one shot
Put you in a trance
Now does it ever attack your culture
It's just a stupid dance
So when you're ready for love
You gotta show your hands
Come on and take a chance
It's your romance
This business carbonation
Less pop more fizz
Coming over on the radio station
It's killing us kidsEmbed
