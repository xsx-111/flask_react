Different Kind Of Fine Lyrics
She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make them wonder which way to go
Make a man change his mind
She's a lawyer's queen, a trucker's dream
With a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine

Cadillacs and caviar
Well, that isn't how she rolls
Implants and tummy tucks
She sure doesn't need those
She's a cool drink of water
When the summer's mean
Poured into those Levis jeans
She's country as the day is long


Tan and lean like a long-neck bottle
In the passenger seat
Got her hand on the throttle
She'll get you there right on time
Lord, take you down to Tijuana
Make you want to slap your mama
Got you all tore up and made you spill your dip cup
Bona fide, a different kind of fine
