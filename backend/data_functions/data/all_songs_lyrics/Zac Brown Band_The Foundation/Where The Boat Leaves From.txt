Where The Boat Leaves From Lyrics
There's a place, where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
But you got to get away to where the boat leaves from

Take one part sand, and one part sea, one part shade of banana tree
The drinks they're cold and the reggae is hot
And I know this is the place for me


See the problem is that you're right there
And there's a perfectly good island somewhere
Where a ride that floats and don't grab your coats
You won't need it where we are going


Pick me up
Pick me up
Pick me up
Put me down
Down on the sand where its cool
Put me down
When I fall off my stool
Put me down
I'll just sleep there til morning comes around
With sunshine tanned ladies and pi√±a colodas
And Bob Marley songs that are playing
There's a song in my ear that I want you to hear
Soft tropical lips that are singin

Ooh pick me up
Ooh pick me up
I got to goEmbed
