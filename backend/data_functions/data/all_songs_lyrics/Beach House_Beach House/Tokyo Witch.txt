Tokyo Witch Lyrics
In a dark wintry Tokyo
In the Mahjong parlor he waits
Severed past running through his hands
Glory comes to the one who waits
In the hallways, they're lying there
In the red blossom of the days
In your arms, there is nothing left
Who you are is run away

My whole life is the mystery that I can't break
Our aims is a calvary of our mistakes
I would love to heal you now

In a dark wintry Tokyo
In the Mahjong parlours, they wait
Severed past weaving through their hands
Glory comes to the ones that wait
In the art of the arm
Red blossom of the days

All I wanted to see is that I am better
All I want to believe is that I am better
Round and round
All I want you to see is that I am better
Round and round1Embed
