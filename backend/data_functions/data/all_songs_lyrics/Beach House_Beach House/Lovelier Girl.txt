Lovelier Girl Lyrics
Long days of wanting you here
Living in fear
Shedding a tear for you
Long nights of pasty-faced moons
Echo in rooms
Filling with gloom for me

Letters so hard to mail
Feeling like the wind from the sea

Now step into the light
Girl know the fright
In all the world than you
There's nothing lovelier, girl
In all the world
Than making love to you

Letters so hard to mail
Feeling like the wind from the sea
Lately got to thinking that
How I wonâ€™t have you here with meEmbed
