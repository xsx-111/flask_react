Heart and Lungs Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4

From all eyes, the land disappears
All that is left is Is a hollow leg of tears
From her smile, the golden tooth is won
Child, your only hope has flown
All gone to this House
All I have left is the only place I've been

It's all heart and lungs
It's not that much fun
It's hard, hard to run
It's not that much fun
It's all heart and lungs
It's not that much fun
It's all...Embed
