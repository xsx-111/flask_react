Apple Orchard Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4

You only give me what you don't want no more
Ask the questions that you don't know at all

Let's lie down for a while
You canâ€™t smile
Lay your head in the old
Old fashion

You know how it is, my friend
In the boxes of those picture frames
Hold your inside 'cause you're cold at night
Warm your heart, love, 'cause you're by my side

Let's lie down for a while
You can smile
Lay your head in the old
Old fashion

Lay your head in the apple orchard
Take your time You can settle down
Hold your breath
'Cause you're, you're good at nothing
Hold your head on me
For a while1Embed
