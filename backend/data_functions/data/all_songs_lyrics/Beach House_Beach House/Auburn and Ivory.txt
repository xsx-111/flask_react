Auburn and Ivory Lyrics
Once when I saw her there
White light, she stood so still
Warming her eyes to the sea
Hardly her way to be free

Auburn and ivory
Heartbreak and pony tails

Holding her bones by the fire
Writing the letter, she saves
White page turns gold to her lies
Wanting her one sacrifice

Auburn and ivory
Heartbreak and pony tails

Come to me and I'll tell you what's wrong
She said
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for...
Once when I saw her there
White light, she stood so still
White page turns gold to her lies
...Her one sacrifice

Auburn and ivory
Heartbreak and pony tails3Embed
