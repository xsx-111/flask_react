Saltwater Lyrics
Love you all the time
Even though you're not mine
Love you all the time
Dreaming in the saltwater
Timing's gone all bad
Broken thing and a broken wing

You couldn't lose me if you tried
'Cause I'll be rolling to your side, baby

Love you all the time
Even though you're not mine
Love you all the time
Broken thing and a broken wing

You couldn't lose me if you triedEmbed
