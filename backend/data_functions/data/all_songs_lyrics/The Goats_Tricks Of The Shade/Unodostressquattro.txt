Unodostressquattro Lyrics
(Uno, dos, tres quarttro)
Oatie's  my appellation, couldn't join the Zulu nation
Can't  use morals to attract skins at the station
Need to send my salutation to the lady with the ride
And the woman sitting on the inside
Of  a not so dumpy 1992
She  can bring the paddle and I'll saddle a canoe
Please listen to my blurb, it is never rock and roll
You  can live and die on rock and never find ya Soul Train goes choo tee choo colored girls doot dee doo
Or so says a rock and roller who thinks he's cooked life through Hmmmm, that's his testimony
I ain't rapping hard so as not to be as phony
Hi dee hi dee ho its off to work I trudge
Two  weeks of the year, yeah, I get to taste the fudge
And budge, 'cause money makes me happy
I ain't unique its this philosophy that's crappy

My mental never petals or settles to the ghettos
Fame'll keep you tame because the famers go insane
Now I likes to break up the racks that you make up
Time and time again because the shooter says "Hold up."
Yo what's up bub?
I'm scrappin' for my stubs
My stubs are kinda scrappy so the gov just plays me scrub
Push me like a pusher and ig me like a nig
Figure, how you figure, why I can't be that big
Man livin grand slappin all the hands
Play the prez's right hand like Dan
And eatin caviar chillin at the bars
But yo I think you know I'm drinkin Kool-Aid outta jars
Tropical Punch, hey Tropical Punch
The Goats have been quoted as to being out to lunch Just cause we crunch on political systems
Wisdom hizim schism gives'em
Sisters being treated like they are panty hose
If a brother needs a blow give him kleenex for his nose I suppose that morals are the equalizer
Measure a man by his rumping
Energizer Can he do it all night long like the rhythm of the song Is he wide on the inside or skinny and long
Do not get me wrong this blurb is not for toddlers
I wrote it with my leg up as one of life's real hobblers
Mind bogglers, I can never understand
Why people make toddlers then treat them as garbage cans
"Do not beat me, beat up on your kiddies"
I did not make this up it is someone else's diddy bitty
Combing hair hits her girl all too easy
Girl grows up used to being treated sleazy
Folks call her Breezy because she never complains
But it was her mother who taught her to refrainEmbed
