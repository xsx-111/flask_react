Wrong Pot 2 Piss In Lyrics
Serve me up, serve me up, serve me up a plate
A Styled linguistics flowing at a smooth rate
Commotion, the notion that we need to settle
Look who called the kettle black so don't you mettle Jack
I was turning now I'm done turning other cheeks
You had your time to beef now let Madd like speak
You're just a Honey Nut, Honey Nut Cheerio
I pour some rhymes in and now you're soggy yo
'Cause while I'm shriveling you be getting fatter
They swing me M A Double but my shit gets madder than that
You run the flam so you think that you're a pisser
You picked the wrong one, so cool it Mister
Blisters, that's what you got on your doubly bubbly lips
You need some Campho-Phenique before you try to dip
On this dye you talking Jimmie Walker
Ain't got Good Times on this, so stop your gawkin'

Well it's me the rhymer, me the poem sayer
Me the funky dunkin' blubber b-ball player
Never a slayer of the same genre propster
I never wanted to be a gangster or a mobster
And never a copster eating lobster on the take a
Saying goodness saka to the humble honest Quakers
Breaker the bump like a crystal coffee creamer
Tell me how you can school me if you was born in a beamer
Dreamer American, cream of the very land
Stolen from the Indians and brothers like Farrakhan
Trifle, it's not like a flick starring Fievel
Stifle, I won't, I'd join the bloods with the rifles
Like Eiffel, the tower, I observe the oppression
Pissy (pissy) poor, here's a white boy's confession
Twister, you vicing, the labor of this mission
George you got a lot of piss but wrong pot to piss in

You got the wrong pot pot, pot pot to piss in
Got the wrong pot pot, pot pot to piss in
Got the wrong pot pot, pot pot to piss in
Got the wrong pot pot, pot pot to piss in

David Duke you better put yours up or get koofed
Passing him up, but he out of luck with no proof, yeah
Missed the pot 'cause you forgot about the hippahopper
But Jack-in-the-box pulled out the stops
You know my piss is hotter
It takes a lot to get through if you don't pursue the truth
'Cause I got a crew and if you get new I'm gonna turn it loose
So here's your noose, I made it white to match your wack ass hood
And watch  your back 'cause Swayzack reacts damn good
I think you better get respect and correctly sort it out
Because we don't want to have to let Willie Horton out
My man Rodney King would love a swing
If Yusef Hawkins was walking he'd say the same thing
Go stand in the ring and burn a cross
Your own hate fire transpired to burn your hoods off
Step off or pay the cost for not listenin'
That's when you lost, you picked the wrong pot to piss in

You got the wrong pot pot, pot pot to piss in
Got the wrong pot pot, pot pot to piss in
Got the wrong pot pot, pot pot to piss in
Got the wrong pot pot, pot pot to piss inEmbed
