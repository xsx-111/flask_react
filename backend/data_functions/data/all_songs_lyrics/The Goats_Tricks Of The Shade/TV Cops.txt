TV Cops LyricsMadd:
Some used to step 'cause they didn't know I worked
Others use to step 'cause they didn't know I hurt
Plaguing me with problems cause they thought I was a gangster gassed like a tanker
No time for po pranksters I was spliffed from the giddy up
They didn't give a fuck, so I didn't give a fuck
Hat to the back and my jeans way saggin hittin some freestyle, frontin and braggin mindin my own biz
When they wanna stop me hungry for some doughnuts
But they chose to pop me female and a brother
Should I say another word cause ya know how this goat is gettin served id name and number up against the wall
Cause we're startin to wonder ya got alot a dollars in your pocket for a fuckin bum hands on the wall and assume the position
Clubs start pokin, I'm like man you must be jokin just because I do some tokin, big blunt smokin
It can happen to you because it happened to me cause these ain't the cops that you see on T.V
Swayzack:
Now I'm inclined to say my part enable me to explain how I was labled from the start
I was feeling like cupid tryin to capture a heart but an arrow's really stupid so I made like a dart
Started to sprint but I was stopped in my tracks by a couple of cops
They were white and uptight, right so I didn't try to fight as they grabbed me by my back
Cause cops can overreact and I thought they might attack but picture that
Swayzack a criminal I busted a rap because they obviously just didn't know so here we go to make a long story shorter
Swayzack ain't game for the bread and the water then the order was to lay on the ground put your hands on your head
Don't make a muthafuckin sound
They're breakin me down but they still ain't found nothin they frontin 'cause here's one blunt they missed my fist was clenched around a big fat spliff
It can happen to you 'cause it happened to me and these ain't the cops that you see on T.V
Oatie:
Step to the line and drop ya drawers for the inspector
I'm not homophobic but these cops got my rector
In full view on the conjecture
That I might hide a blade in the shade of the pore
That was there when I was made shit
I've got one brother in the pit of the wriggly piggies
Who are throwing a pig type fit "Shut ya fucking face kid or I'll friggin lick ya"
"Grab ya ankles like bo jangles or I'll fuckin kick ya"
Verbally abusive's not conducive to a transition
Just a bunch a boys in blue gettin' ya used ta the system of the rapists and murderers and the sons of sons of sam
But look at where I am saying uncle scam
I am sick of the piggies making me drop my fuckin skivies
Sick of being arrested when I haven't done diddly being riddled with the abuses in prison no segregation by law
Well check out this division
"Head to the hoosegow head ta the slammer head to the roundhouse grab a sledge-hammer"
Arrested four times but never found guilty but these ain't the cops that ya see on T.VEmbed
