Georgie Bush Kids LyricsThe Georgie Bush Kids:
We represent the Georgie Bush Kids, the Georgie Bush Kids, the Georgie Bush Kids
We represent the Georgie Bush Kids, we got an education cuz our daddy could afford it
Georgie Bush Kid 1: Hey look dudes, here comes two of those public schools and adidas wearing gangshooting welfare needin' kids.  Hey!  Antenna head!  What's it like wearing a bullet proof vest during recess?
Georgie Bush Kid 2: Public school sponsored by the NRA
Georgie Bush Kid 1: Yeah!  (Georgie Bush Kids all laugh)
Hangerhead:  Fuck you!  How would you like me to turn your trust fund into a rectal thermometer?
Georgie Bush Kid 1: Easy dude
Chicken Little: Yeah you private school and healthcare having, Columbus loving, Reebok wearing, two-bit racist!  The only reason you assholes don't wear vests to class is because your daddy's got the green.  You know what?  We outta here Hangerhead
All we need is to find out where Uncle Scam is
Georgie Bush Kid 1: If you dudes are lookin' for someone YOU know, you should check the freak show. (Georgie Bush Kids all laugh)
