Leonard Peltier In A Cage Lyrics("Ten Little Indians" plays in the background)
Barker: Live!  Before your very own eyes!  A real, native American Indian!  You thought the last of the American Indians were killed off on "F-Troop".  No Sir!  We've got a live one right here!  Leonard Peltier in a cage!  Step right up!  Step right up!
Chicken Little: Say Mr. Peltier, you don't look like a freak
Peltier: Well, Uncle Scam certainly thinks so
Chicken Little: Why'd he put you in a cage?
Peltier: It's all part of a freak show's Hippocratic balance.  He let the freak Nelson Mandela out of his cage in a freak show in South Africa.  So he needed to keep another freak in a cage here
Chicken Little: But you're not a freak; you're a native American
Peltier: I know, but at this carnival, that's good enough.  I'm surprise your uncle hasn't seen your freak value yet
Chicken Little: Scam's our uncle.  He's gonna take care of us
Peltier: Like me huh?  Say kid, could you do me a favor?  Could you ask them to stop playing that fake Indian music?  Not only is it degrading, but if I hear it one more time I might really kill someone.  Oh no, here come the carnival cops.  They don't like me talking to the public.  You better goEmbed
