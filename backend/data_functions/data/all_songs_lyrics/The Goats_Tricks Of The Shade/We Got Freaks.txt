We Got Freaks LyricsYeah, you wanna see a freak show?
We got a freak show
We got all kinds of freaks
Mean this is the freak show
Uncle Scam's Federally Funded Freak Show
Look around
You wanna get on rides?
We got all kinds of rides for ya
This is one big ride
So come on down sit on round
Listen to the freak show
Guaranteed, guaranteed for satisfaction
We are the freak show
You wanna see freaks?
We got freaks for ya
We got big ones and small ones
Fat ones
We got freaks all aroundEmbed
