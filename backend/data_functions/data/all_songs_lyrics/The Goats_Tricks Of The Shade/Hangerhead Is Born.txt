Hangerhead Is Born LyricsNarrator: It is July 4th 1999 and Hangerhead is born.  A younger brother of our hero Chicken Little
Man: Hey! Yo! You Chicken Little?
Chicken Little: Yeah Yeah
Man: This is your new kid brother Hangerhead
Chicken Little: Dang!  Another fucking freak! The dude's got a UHF Antenna hangin’ out his grill!  Where's my Mom?
Man: Your Mom was arrested by the Pro-Livins for attempting an abortion and is now doing time at the Pro-Livin Penal Prison.  Looks like this Hangerhead thing is all yours
Chicken Little: Man, don't those Pro-Livin people help me raise him?
Man: Shit, all they do is make sure the kid’s born. After that... well, that's your problem.  What you should do is ask your uncle for help
Chicken Little: What Uncle?
Man: Your Uncle Scam and his Federally Funded Welfare and Freak Show
Chicken Little:  Where the hell's that?
Man: You don't know kid?  Just follow the yellow brick road
Chicken Little: Come on Hangerhead, let's go see our uncleEmbed
