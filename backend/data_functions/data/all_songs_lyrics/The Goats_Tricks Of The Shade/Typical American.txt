Typical American Lyrics
I'm not your typical Amerikkkan

Tell me whose is whose
Tell me who was on the microphone
I'm Oatie of the Goaties
I propose I would like a bone
To edge off the dredge
I'm alleged to have sparked a joint
Political and blisstical
I really hope ya like my points
Aim at a target like a rifle not a shotgun
Don't spray into the fray to prove that I got one
Hide ya hose from Aaron Rose
Cause he knows how to top one's got a nose for the prose
So don't suppose he will stop son
I'm rollin' in this rhyme like ya bite a tenderoni;
Rollin' in this rhyme cause it's mine and ya know me
I'ma mind, defy, or sing like Toni Tone
Singin' for their supper like a dog does a boni

George, get off my jock cause I'm really gettin' tired a this shit
So step back Dan, and throw up those fists
Cause I'ma wriggity wreck shop and I turn this mothafucka out
Pay what is due me, less I'm goin' up in your mouth
Yup yup I got the rhymes ta kick your, but
It be the G to the O to the A to the T the M-A Double-D
Say "What up, hus? I got bucks. Yeah, I be on the 2 bus."
So what's up? I got 'nuff respect to make ya jump
Welfare receiver with the north side attitude
I've had the shit piled up like in multitudes
Nappy headed, holey shoed, roundin' out the roster first
Ya wanna step ya better check the Green Monster first
I don't pretend to be a nice guy
But still ya tryin'
I can go to plan B and you can get an eye jammy
So save the sob stories for a storybook
And look Jack in the box can take a lickin' but I'm never gettin'
Took By Uncle Scam and his band of political crooks
Searchin' nooks and crannies of my granny's pocket book
"Hello, hello? Can ya hear me now, G?"
The typical American kid that ain't me
Neither is Oatie or the M-A double-D
So pass the dutchie from the left hand side
Don't hide the crop cause I got the E-Z Wides
I'ma survive, not suck seed
Cause I stand as a man, you can't hand me no bird feed

Pop goes ya head like the top of a daisy
Ya ghost when the word hits like Patrick Swayze
Crazy, this shit about a plausible denial
North takes the raps, and ya claps at the trial
Pie Ã  la mode, the ghettos will explode
While ya sit pigeon toed at a diamond commode
Another episode of ya walkin' the streets
Million dollar stroll, five thousand pigs on the beat
For the very first time, imported from the hills
Ya take money from the poor like a fiend pops pills
Like the Mills Brothers sing a very white song
But the roots of ya soul kinda colored belong
I'm paralyzing punks with a positive pedigree
For those who choose to love me, I'm the M-A the double D
For those who choose to hate me, I negate like their full effect
Feelin' ready and willin' to break Darryl Gates' neck
Like, "Fee diddilly, Foe, Fum," I gets dumb
And like the typical American black male
I'm done
Eatin' apple pies when M-A Double's rockin' rhymes
And you know they on my nuts hus
They climb, they climb
The hell with Stormin' Norman (Schwarzkopf) I write rhymes, Black
They be political plus they be all o' that
Philly born and bread wit blunts straight to the head
Callin' me conformist, man I warned you that shit was dead
Military is a mockery for all to see
Be all you can be is just another trick that's up their sleeve
But ya better believe that you'll be grievin' when ya ain't receivin'
What was promised don't be astonished cause ya won't be leavin'
They reeled ya in like your skin had fins

Now your're poundin' sand for another man's sins
To each his own to each his to each they say
But I'ma blow a bone, and you can march 'til the cows come home
Your life's alone; that means you rent your own dome
But when you come home in a box
Green draws, green pants, green socks
Typical American, kid, I think notEmbed
