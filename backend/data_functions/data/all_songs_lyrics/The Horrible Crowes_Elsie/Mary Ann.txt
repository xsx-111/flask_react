Mary Ann LyricsLook out below the hurricane comes near
The water's all poison and they're showing their teeth
So is that your baby, oh my my your darling?
Well didn't she hear the sirens and the storm bell's warning?
Woe to your lovers with their soft, fragile hearts
You cry all night long keeping the horses alarmed
Mary Ann, you don't have to worry like them
Mary Ann, Jesus gonna be here soon
Put your tiny hands inside my hand and
One more time for me, Mary Ann
Just look at the sky burning vengeance and fire
I told you not to touch but you're so selfish sometimes
And never trust a stranger with a diamond on his tongue
I told you once baby
I thought by now you
Would've known
My my Mary Ann, you don't have to worry like them
Mary Ann, Jesus gonna be here soon
Put your tiny hands inside my hand and
One more time for me, Mary Ann
My my my Mary Ann, you ain't like them other girls
I see your hand's stillness as the summer goes down
Rock steady I know you won't let me down
Oh yeah
Mary Ann, you don't have to worry like them
Mary Ann, Jesus gonna be here soon
Put your tiny hands inside my hand and
One more time for me, Mary AnnEmbed
