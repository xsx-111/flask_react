Last Rites LyricsStart up the car
Bury your memories
Call on your lovers
Speaking slow and heavy
Call up your boyfriends
From out by the ocean
While I get my last rites read by a thief
While I get my last rites read by a thief
And you look so holy standing in the water
From all my pictures I worshiped before you
My baby just ain't no good
My baby just, she ain't no good
YeahEmbed
