Sugar LyricsI guess you need a little sugar
Cause you always run around
I heard you like a little fancy
Whenever you feel a little inside out
I heard you need a vacation
Said I bored you right to tears
I heard my love was a season
That you wore for the pretty girls
You said no no no no, no no no no
That's not the way it goes
You said no no no no, no no no no
That's not the way it goes
But it is, don't lie
I've seen that curl up around your smile
It is, don't lie
Who do you think that you're kidding this time
Only I know, I know you get lonely at night
I know, I know you get lonely sometimes
I know, I know you get lonely at night
Nobody knows you like I do
I guess you need a little sugar
Cause you never wait around
And I heard you like it to shiver
It's like right up your spine
I saw you walking with him
Down the steps that I walked you in
I got hurried for midnight
With slippers of glass and perfect fits
You said no no no no, no no no no
That's not the way it goes
You said no no no no, no no no no
That's not the way it goes
Oh but it is, don't lie
I've seen that curl up around your smile
It is, don't lie
Who do you think that you're kidding this time
Only I know, I know you get lonely at night
I know, I know you get lonely sometimes
I know, I know you get lonely at night
Nobody knows you like I do
Nobody else waits on you
When your hands shake like the breeze
And your mind is a permanent dream
That you had long before you crawled through my door
Baby, baby, but it is, don't lie
I've seen that curl up around your smile
It is, don't lie
Who do you think gonna be laughing this time
It is, don't lie
I've seen that curl up around your smile
It is, don't lie
Who do you think that you're kidding this timeEmbed
