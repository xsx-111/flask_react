Black Betty & the Moon LyricsMy love, my love, you're the sting of the scorpion
Consider now the angels a little lower than you
And they twist and they turn, and they hold their breath 'til it's blue
And they can't turn away like I can when you're looking like you do
Look at Black Betty what they're tying to you
You did the very thing, baby, that I asked you not to do
Now you got yourself caught in this silk spiderweb
I hope the money fills the holes, cause, see, the roof is caving in
My heart, my heart, you're the moon and her shining light
Darkness and void of form, like you were keeping me alive
And I'm dreaming of poisonings from the venom of my enemies
Clever as the viper, dear, but gentle as a stampede of stones
Look at Black Betty what they're tying to you
You did the very thing, baby, that I asked you not to do
Now you got yourself caught in this silk spiderweb
I hope the money fills the holes, cause, see, the roof is caving in
And they want you to doubt every choice that you've known
And they want to find the holes in the armor exposed
And they come on, whispering, "If you'd just do this for me,"
And turn and show their teeth, just before they sink it in
And better than described, and deeper the descent
I never thought we'd have to learn to doubt a friend
And better than described, so much deeper the descent
I never thought we'd have to learn to doubt a friend
Look at Black Betty what they're tying to you
You did the very thing, baby, that I asked you not to do
Now you got yourself caught in this silk spiderweb
I hope the money fills the holes, cause, see, the roof is caving in
Look at Black Betty what they're tying to you
You did the very thing, baby, that I asked you not to do
Now you got yourself caught in this silk spiderweb
I hope the money fills the holes in the place I used to standEmbed
