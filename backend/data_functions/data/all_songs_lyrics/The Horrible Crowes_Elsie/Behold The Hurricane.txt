Behold The Hurricane Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I remember everything we had
Every breath of this house's creaking
I'm familiar with the cold and the windows and the doors
And the sound of my heart beating
Beating in and out of time

And it's such a shame
I heard the wind say this morning
Be still my heart, I age by years
At the mention of your name
And what a pity this season
Do you remember me my lover?
I don't recognise myself, I'm not the man you loved
Behold the hurricane, behold the hurricane

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I walk around these empty rooms
Where you once moved like the morning
Silhouettes they haunt this house
Like your memory haunts me now
As if it were a dream
As if it were a dream
And it's such a shame
I heard the wind say this morning
Be still my heart, I age by years
At the mention of your name
And what a pity this season
Do you remember me my lover?
I don't recognise myself, I'm not the man you loved
Behold the hurricane, behold the hurricane

I heard the moon has visions of her nightly
I heard the mighty rivers cry out her name
And I saw the heavens and the earth
Yes, I saw the heavens and the earth
Cry over you

It's such a shame
I heard the wind say this morning
Be still my heart, I age by years
At the mention of your name
And what a pity this season
Do you remember me my lover?
I don't recognise myself, I'm not the man you loved
Behold the hurricane, behold the hurricane
(At the door, the leaves had fallen)
Behold the hurricane
(Suddenly I realised that you were gone)
(Suddenly I realised that you were gone)
Behold the hurricaneEmbed
