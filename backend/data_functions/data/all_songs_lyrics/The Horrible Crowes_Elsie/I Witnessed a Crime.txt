I Witnessed a Crime LyricsI guess the moon had had it out for us
And the night and the stars the same
Everything she touched turned to stone or died eventually
Or was never seen the same again
And this heart I had
You never sympathise
And while you held my hand
I think I witnessed a crime
While she drove we sat in silence
All I could do was try to breathe
Her and I we never talked too much or licked our wounds
Just lived between the hours of sleep
And in this dream I had
My screams were baby's breath
I watched her steal the air
Right from the atmosphere
Oh this heart I had
You never paid no mind
And on the long drive home
I think I witnessed a crime
And she said I just went crazy from the heat
And I just lit a little fire under your feet
And that's not so bad, see people do it all the time
It's just a little bit of blood in your eye
Boy, stop all your crying
Yeah, all my debonair
Died in her arms one night
You go so quietly
Once you've seen the end
Oh this heart I had
You never paid no mind
And on the drive home
I think I witnessed a crime
(And this heart that I had)
(And this heart that I had)
(And this heart that I had)Embed
