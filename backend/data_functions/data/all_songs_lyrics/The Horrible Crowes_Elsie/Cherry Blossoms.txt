Cherry Blossoms LyricsI drive this car through the city every night
There's a quiet I never heard before
And lonely, my sister could not describe
All the good things gone wrong
And there was blood on my teeth
From the long winter here
Bones broke in half
A stain on my shirt
From a couple hours out with the boys
And all good things come to an end
And all memory has left my bones
If I drove straight off this bridge
Only God and my baby would know
I'm sure she'd be laughing, conjuring spring
With some fella who just said the right thing
And there'd be blood on my teeth
From the long winter here
Bones broke in half
A stain on my shirt
From a couple hours out with the boys
And all good things come to an end
See all I can do is think about you
And miss all your kisses like the spring
But if I had a sign
That one day you'd be mine again, oh no
If I could hold you right then
As the chill in this season sputtered and spit and died with...
Blood on my teeth
From just what they did here
Snow tumbling down on the ground
And me stumbling out of my heart
Finding cherry blossoms on the hood of my carEmbed
