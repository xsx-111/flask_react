Go Tell Everybody Lyrics(Everybody knows, you're my disease...)
(Every feeling like first love...)
I've been known to wear a fine black suit and a murder of a tie
I've got miles on my shoes that your brothers can't buy
I've got more than your man, more than even what he wants
I carry each and every ghost of my lovers at once
And they say...
Sugar, baby, we've got everything you need
And they say...
Sugar, baby, we've got something to see
And they say...
Sugar, baby, we've got everything you need
And even what you want
So go tell everybody that you drove your poor lover crazy
And take a good look at just what the night did
There ain't nothing left of your dearly departed
And I just fell to pieces on the night that you said you were leaving
You can't come back to the heart that you left
So go tell everybody that your man is dead
And there's always just these three siren spirits always following me
They just appeared one night in the passenger seat
They tell me all about your sins, salivate from their tongues
And they kiss from their lips but their fingers is so cold to the touch
Sugar, baby, we've got everything you need
Sugar, baby, we've got something to see
Sugar, baby, we've got everything you need
And even what you want
So go tell everybody that you drove your poor lover crazy
And take a good look at just what the night did
There ain't nothing left of your dearly departed
And I just fell to pieces on the night that you said you were leaving
You can't come back to the heart that you left
So go tell everybody that your man is dead
I was a man of great sympathy when I loved you, baby
But tonight all my sympathy is gone
I was a man of great sympathy when I loved you, baby
But tonight all my sympathy is gone
I was a man of great sympathy when I loved you, baby
But tonight all my sympathy is gone
I was a man of great sympathy when I loved you, my baby
But tonight all my sympathy, oh she's gone
I was a man of great sympathy, when I did love you, my baby
But tonight all my sympathy is goneEmbed
