Infra-Red LyricsOne last thing before I shuffle off the planet
I will be the one to make you crawl
So I came down to wish you an unhappy birthday
Someone call the ambulance, there's gonna be an accident
I'm coming up on infra-red
There is no running that can hide you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
Forget your running, I will find you
One more thing before we start the final face off
I will be the one to watch you fall
So I came down to crash and burn your beggar's banquet
Someone call the ambulance, there's gonna be an accident
I'm coming up on infra-red
There is no running that can hide you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
Forget your running, I will find you
(And the dark is running after you, I swear it, the dark is running after you. The dark is after you...)
Someone call the ambulance, there's gonna be an accident
I'm coming up on infra-red
There is no running that can hide you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
Forget your running, I will find you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
There is no running that can hide you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
Forget your running, I will find you
I'll find you, I'll find you3Embed
