Follow the Cops Back Home LyricsThe call to arms was never true
Time to imbibe, here's to you
I'll tell you stories bruised and blue
Of drum machines and landslides
Just one more round before we're through
More psychedelic yuppie flu
It's such a silly thing to do
And now we're stuck on rewind

Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses
The call to arms was never true
Let's take a ride and push it through
Suspended animation glue
And blame it on apartheid
Let's spend the night in Jimmy Choo's
I'll give you coats and cheap shampoo
I'll give you nothing else to do
And now we're stuck on rewind
Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses
Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses
The call to arms was never true
I'm medicated, how are you?
Let's take a dive swim right through
Sophisticated points of view

Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses
Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses1Embed
