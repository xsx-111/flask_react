Space Monkey Lyrics
Space monkey in the place to be
Riding in a rocket to a planet of sound
Shooting the moon, playing Dominoes in drag
An increase in population of a hundred percent
Space monkey in the place to be
With a chemical peel and a picture of Mary
Out on a limb in the carnival of me
Raising the temperature one hundr
Ed degrees
We're sown together
She's born to mesmer
Beside, astride her
I die inside her

Space monkey in the place to be
A mass of contradiction in a golden frame
Raising the roof in a calamity way
Completely meretricious of a poke in the eye
Space monkey in the place to be
Talk of the town with a Colombian rock
Out on a limb in the carnival of me
Raising the temperature one hundred degrees
We're sewn together
She's born to mesmer
Beside, astride her
I die inside her

It's far too sacred, don't ever fake it
And don't, and don't, and don't let me down
Like you let me down before
Like you let me down before

Space monkey in the place to be
With some free-association and a hole in her head
Out on a limb in the carnival of me
Raising the temperature one hundred degrees

We're sewn together
She's born to mesmer
Beside, astride her
I die inside her

It's far too sacred, don't ever fake it
And don't, and don't, and don't let me down
Like you let me down before
Like you let me down before
Like you let me down before
Like you let me down before5Embed
