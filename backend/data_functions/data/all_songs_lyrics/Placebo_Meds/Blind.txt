Blind LyricsIf I could tear you from the ceilin'
And guarantee source divine
Rid you of possessions fleetin'
Remain your funny Valentine

Don't go and leave me
And please, don't drive me blind
Don't go and leave me
And please, don't drive me blind
If I could tear you from the ceilin'
I know best have tried
I'd fill your every breath with meanin'
And find the place we both could hide
Don't go and leave me
And please, don't drive me blind
Don't go and leave me
And please, don't drive me blind

I know you're broken
I know you're broken
I know you're broken
If I could tear you from the ceilin'
Id freeze us both in time
And find a brand new way of seein'
Your eyes forever glued to mine

Please, don't drive me blind
Please, don't drive me blind
Please, don't drive me blind
Please, don't drive me blind
I know you're broken
I know you're broken
I know you're broken4Embed
