Pierrot the Clown LyricsLeave me dreaming on the bed
See you right back here tomorrow, for the next round
Keep this scene inside your head
As the bruises turn to yellow and the swelling goes down
And if you're ever around in the city or the suburbs of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in sorrow, wearing a frown, like Pierrot the clown
Saw you crashing 'round the bay
Never seen you act so shallow or look so brown
Remembered all the things you'd say
How your promises went hollow, as you threw me to the ground
And if you're ever around in the backstreets or the alleys of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in pity, wearing a frown, like Pierrot the clown
When I dream, I dream of your lips
When I dream, I dream of your kiss
When I dream, I dream of your fists
Your fists
Your fists...
Leave me bleeding on the bed
See you right back here tomorrow, for the next round
Keep this scene inside your head
As the bruises turn to yellow, and the swelling goes down...
And if you're ever around in the city or the suburbs of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in sorrow, wearing a frown, like Pierrot the Clown
