In the Cold Light of Morning LyricsIn cold light of morning
While everyone is yawning, you're high
In the cold light of morning
The party gets boring, you're high
As your skin starts to scratch
And wave yesterdays action goodbye
Forget past indiscretions
And stolen possessions, you're high
In the cold light
In the cold light of morning
While everyone's yawning, you're high
In the cold light of morning
You're drunk sick from whoring and high
Staring back from the mirrors
A face that you don't recognize
It's a loser, a sinner
A cock in a dildo's disguise
In the cold light
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
As your skin starts to scratch
And wave yesterdays action goodbye
Forget past indiscretions
And stolen possessions, you're high
In the cold light of day
Tomorrow's only a kettle
Whistle, whistle
Whistle, whistle
Whistle, whistle
Whistle, whistle
Whistle away
In the cold light of day2Embed
