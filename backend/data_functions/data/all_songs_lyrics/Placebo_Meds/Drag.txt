Drag LyricsYou're always ahead of the game
I drag behind
You never get caught in the rain
When I'm drenched to the bone every time
You're the first one to swim across the Seine
I lag behind
You're always ahead of the game
While I drag behind

I drag behind
I drag behind
I drag behind
I drag behind
You're always ahead of the pack
I drag behind
You posses every trait that I lack
By coincidence or by design
You're the monkey I got on my back
That tells me to shine
You're always ahead of the pack
While I drag behind
 x2
You're always ahead of the rest
When I'm always on time
You got A's on your algebra tests
I failed and they kept me behind
I just gotta get off my chest
That I think you're divine
You're always ahead of the rest
While I drag behind
