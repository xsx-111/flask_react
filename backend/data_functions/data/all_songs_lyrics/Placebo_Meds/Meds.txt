Meds LyricsI was alone, falling free
Trying my best not to forget
What happened to us, what happened to me
What happened as I let it slip
I was confused by the powers that be
Forgetting names and faces
Passers by, were looking at me
As if they could erase it
Baby...did you forget to take your meds?
Baby...did you forget to take your meds?
I was alone, staring over the ledge
Trying my best not to forget
All manner of joy, all manner of glee
And our one heroic pledge
How it mattered to us, how it mattered to me
And the consequences
I was confused, by the birds and the bees
Forgetting if I meant it
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
I was alone, falling free, trying my best not to forget6Embed
