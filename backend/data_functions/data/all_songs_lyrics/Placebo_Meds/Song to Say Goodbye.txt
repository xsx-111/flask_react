Song to Say Goodbye Lyrics
You are one of God's mistakes
You crying, tragic waste of skin
I'm well aware of how it aches
And you still won't let me in
Now, I'm breaking down your door
To try and save your swollen face
Though I don't like you anymore
You lying, trying waste of space

Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And a voice that made me cry
My, oh, my

You were mother nature's son
Someone to whom I could relate
Your needle and your damage done
Remains a sordid twist of fate
Now, I'm tryin' to wake you up
To pull you from the liquid sky
'Cause if I don't, we'll both end up
With just your song to say goodbye
My, oh, my
A song to say goodbye
A song to say goodbye
A song to say

Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And a voice that made me cry

It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye8Embed
