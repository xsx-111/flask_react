Broken Promise Lyrics
We'll rise above this
We'll cry about this
As we live and learn
A broken promise
I was not honest
Now I watch as tables turn
And youre singing

I'll wait my turn
To tear inside you
Watch you burn
And I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn

I'll cry about this
And hide my cuckold eyes
As you come off all concerned
And I'll find no solace
In your poor apology
In your regret, that sounds absurd
And keep singing

I'll wait my turn
To tear inside you
Watch you burn
And I'll wait my turn
To terrorize you
Watch you burn
I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn
And this is a promise
Promise is a promise
Promise is a promise
Promise is a promise

And I'll wait my turn
To tear inside you
Watch you burn
I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn

Promise is a promise
Promise is a promise
Promise is a promise

A broken promise
You were not honest
I'll bide my time
I'll wait my turn2Embed
