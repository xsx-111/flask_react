One of a Kind LyricsOn top of the world you get nothing done
Talk is cold and burns like the sun
Can't you see these skies are breaking
Cause the top of the word is where I'm from
The back of the class is where I was
Keeping quiet playing dumb
Can't you see these skies are breaking
Cause the back of the class is where I'm from
And I am one
I am
I am one
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
I'm on a race and it's killing time
I don't need yours I'll keep it with mine
Can't you see these skies are breaking
Cause I'm on a race and I'm doing fine, thank you
Two of a kind no one home
I'm in a crowd and I'm still alone
Can't you see the skies are breaking
Cause one of a kind is all I own
I am one
I am
I am one
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
Out of the womb and into the void
I wanna try but I get annoyed
Can't you see these skies are breaking
Cause I'm out of the womb and into the void
I am one
I am
I am one
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
On top of the world you get nothing done1Embed
