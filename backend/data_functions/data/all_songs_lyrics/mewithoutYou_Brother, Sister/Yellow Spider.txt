Yellow Spider LyricsWe took the twine we used to use
To tie up tight our tattered shoes
Twisted twigs and crooked cross
A necklace for the deeply lost
Builder with the broken bricks
Mother to the baby chicks
You made this world to look so nice
I wonder what the next one's like?
Yellow spider, yellow leaf
Yellow spider, yellow leaf
Yellow spider, yellow leaf
Confirms my deepest held belief...1Embed
