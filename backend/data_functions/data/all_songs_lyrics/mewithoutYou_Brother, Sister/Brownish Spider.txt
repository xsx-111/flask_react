Brownish Spider LyricsEvery thing I'd thought I'd learned
Ambition and illusion turned
To drawings on a loose leaf sheet
Of figs and fruits I couldn't eat
What in her do I require?
The face of gratified desires
And what in me does she require?
The face of gratified desires
Brownish spider, brownish leaf
Brownish spider, brownish leaf
Brownish spider, brownish leaf
Confirms my deepest held belief
No more spider, no more leaf
No more spider, no more leaf
No more spider, no more leaf
No more me, no more belief1Embed
