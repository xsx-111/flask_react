The Dryness and the Rain Lyrics
First came a strong wind
Rippin' off rooftops like bottlecaps
And bending lamp posts down to the ground
Then came a thunder, shattering my windows
But you were not that strong wind or that mighty sound
That left the barn in shambles
The rabbit hutch in ruins
The split-rail fence splintered and the curtains torn
All the cows out from the pastures
Trampling on the pumpkins
And the horses from their stables ambling in the corn

Isa ruhu-lah 'alaihis-salat was-salam
Isa ruhu-lah 'alaihis-salat was-salam

I've flown unnoticed just behind you like an insect
And I watched you like a falcon
From a distance as you passed
Then swooped down to be nearer
To the traces of the footsteps
To pick the fallen grain
From the pressed down dirt and crooked grass
And I'm gonna take that grain
And I'm gonna crush it all together
Into the flour of a bread
As small and simple and sincere
As when the dryness and the rain
Finally drink from one another
The gentle cup of mutual surrender tears!
Come on!
A fish swims in the sea
While the sea is in a certain sense
Contained within the fish!
Oh, what am I to think
What the writing
Of a thousand lifetimes
Could not explain
If all the forest trees were pens
And all the oceans - ink?

Isa ruhu-lah 'alaihis-salat was-salam
Isa ruhu-lah 'alaihis-salat was-salam
Isa ruhu-lah 'alaihis-salat was-salam
Isa ruhu-lah 'alaihis-salat was-salam
Salam, salam, salam, salam
Nastagh-firuka ya Hokan
Ya Dhal-Jalah wal-Ikram
Isa ruhu-lah 'alaihis-salat was-salam
Ya Halim, ya Qahhar
Ya Muntaqim, ya Ghaffar!
La Ilaha ilallahu, Allahu Akbar!1Embed
