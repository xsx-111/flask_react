A Glass Can Only Spill What It Contains LyricsA cat came drifting onto
My porch from the outside cold
And with eyes closed, drinking
Warm milk from my bowl
Thought: "Nobody hears me, nobody hears me
'Cause I crept in so soft!
And nobody sees me, nobody sees me"
As I watched six steps off
Like the peacocks wandering
The walkways of the zoo
Who have twice the autonomy
The giraffes and tigers do
Saying:
"No one can stop me, no one can stop me!
No one clips my claws!
Now everyone watch me, everyone watch me
Scale these outside walls!"
Oh, you pious and profane
Put away your praise and blame
"A glass can only spill what it contains!"
To the perpetually plain
And the incurably inane
"A glass can only spill what it contains!"
What new mystery is this?
What blessed backwardness?
The Immeasurable one is held and does not resist!
Struck by wicked words and foolish fists of senseless men
The Almighty One does not defend!
I'm halfway listening to what she thinks she knows
We're like children dressing in our parents clothes saying:
"Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
No one knows my name!
No, Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me... "
I half-heartedly explained
But gave up peacefully ashamed
"As a glass can only spill what it contains!"
We went from Portugal and Spain
And in her mind the entire time it rained!
"A glass can only spill what it contains!"
What new mystery is this?
In overflowing emptiness!
The invisible is seen among the shadows and the mist
Before my doubting eyes
The infinite appears this time
The unquestionable is questioned
But makes no reply!
What new mystery is this?
What new mystery is this?
What new mystery is this?
What new mystery is this?
What new mystery is this?
"My rabbi"
My lips betray with a kiss
What new mystery is this?4Embed
