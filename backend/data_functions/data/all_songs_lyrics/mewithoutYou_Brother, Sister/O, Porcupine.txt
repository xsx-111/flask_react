O, Porcupine LyricsWithout a queen the locust swarm
Turned the ground to black
Descending like a shadowy tower on a fish's back
And scattered the sticks who crawled
Like snakes in the sand
As the red clay took the form of a lizard
Who rushed like a moth to the flame of my open hand
(while, in my little world
My sad, little world...)
A speckled bird humbly inspired
Ran across the road when it could have flown
And it made me smile
And at the water's edge, Babylon
As we laid and slept, the river wept
For you, O'Zion!
The stones cry out
Bells shake the sky
All creation groans...
SHHHH!!!
Listen to it!
Messes of men in farmer poverty;
Not much for monks but we pretend to be
Share a silent meal and a pot of chamomile
Gypsies like us should be stamped in solidarity
I held you in my fond but distant memory
While waiting for the Mother Hen to gather me
Who regretfully wrote
"you have a decent ear for notes
But you can't yet appreciate harmony."
O' porcupine perched low in the tree
Your eyes to mine:
"you'd be well inclined not to mess with me."
And at the garden's edge beneath a speechless sky
As his friends slept, Jesus wept
And it's no wonder why
You wanna be set free?
You wanna set me free?
Well that can only come from
A union with the One who never dies
(while, in my little world
In my sad, little world
I patched a plaster wall in my little world
And in my little world, I was waiting (just dying!)
To take offence at something in my little world
In my little world
In my sad, little world
This is all there is in my little world.)
In darkness a light shines on me
In darkness a light shines on you
I never gathered figs from a thorny branch
I never picked a grapefruit off a bramble bush
And for the past five- almost six years now!-
You know you haven't once looked at me
With kindness in your eyes
You say Judas is a brother of mine?
Oh, but sister in our darkness a light shines
And all I ever want to say for the rest of my life
Is how that light is G-d
And though I've been mistaken on this or that point
That light is G-dEmbed
