The Sun and the Moon LyricsDaniel broke the king's decree
Peter stepped from the ship to the sea
There was hope for Job like a cut down tree
I hope that there's such hope for me
Dust be on my mind's conceptions
And anything I thought I knew
Each word of my lips' description
And on all that I compare to You
The preference of the sun was
To the south side of the farm
I planted to the north in a terra-cotta pot
Blind as I'd become, I used to wonder where you are-
These days I can't find where you're not!
Mine's been a yard carefully surface level tended
Foxes burrowed underground
My gardening so well self-recommended
What could I have done but let you down?
The Sun and the Moon
I wanna see both worlds as One!
The Sun and the Moon
I wanna see both worlds as One!
The Sun and the Moon
I wanna see both worlds as One!
Mine's been a story, dimly remembered
And by the time it's told, halfway true
Of bad behavior well engendered
What good is each good thing we think we do?
Daniel broke the king's decree
Peter stepped from the ship to the sea
There was hope for Job like a cut down tree
I only hope that there's such hope for me
Find a friend and stay close and with a melting heart
Tell them whatever youâ€™re most ashamed of-
Our parents have made so many mistakes
But may we forgive them and forgive ourselves
The Sun and the Moon
I wanna see both worlds as One!
The Sun and the Moon
I wanna see both worlds as One!
The Sun and the Moon
I wanna see both worlds as One!
The Sun and the Moon are my Father's eyes
The Sun and the Moon are my Father's eyes
The Sun and the Moon are my Father's eyes
The Sun and the Moon are my Father's eyes
The Sun and the Moon are my Father's eyes
The Sun and the Moon are my Father's eyes
The Sun and the Moon are my Father's eyes
The Sun and the Moon are my Father's eyes
The Sun and the Moon are my Father's eyes
The Sun and the Moon are my Father's eyesEmbed
