Orange Spider LyricsA note we wrote the other day
To any mice who pass this way
On crumbed and sugared countertops:
"we must insist
Your traffic STOP."
In their defense, they don't refuse
But nonetheless we've come to use
Snapping traps and poison beans
(far less diplomatic means)
Orange spider, orange leaf
Orange spider, orange leaf
Orange spider, orange leaf
Confirms my deepest held beliefEmbed
