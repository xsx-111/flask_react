Wolf Am I! (And Shadow) Lyrics
It's the smell of hot summertime trash
It's the city noise of a busy street
It's a train derailed and a two car head-on freeway crash
Each time we meet
"And if it comes as some sort of a surprise", she said
"That I seem so composed
I've kept this moment closer to my eyes", she said
"Than the glasses resting on the edge of my nose"

Shadow am I!
Shadow am I!
A question of a person, no said reply
Wolf am I!
Wolf and Shadow cast on the sheep as I pass by
Shadow am I!
Shadow am I!
Or like a
Wearing-black-socks-and-white-woolen-locks
Wolf am I, and shadow

She was graceful and green as a stem
But I walk heavy on delicate ground
Oh there, I go showing off again
Self-impressed by how well I can put myself down!
And there I go again, to the next further removed level
Of that same exact feigned humility!
This for me goes on and on to the point of nausea
Shadow am I!
Like suspicion that's never confirmed
But it's never denied
Wolf am I
No, "shadow”, I think is better
As I’m not so much something
More like the absence of something
So shadow am I!
The whole material world seems to me
Like a newspaper headline-
It explicitly demands your attention
And it may even contain some truth
Of what's really going on here

One day the water's gonna wash it away
One day the water's gonna wash it away
One day the water's gonna wash it away
And on that day
One day the water's gonna wash it away
One day the water's gonna wash it away
Nothin' clever to say
One day, nothin' else to say2Embed
