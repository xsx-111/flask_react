Running Town Lyrics
Just a step onto the street
An uncomfortable heat
Rattlers at your feet
In Running Town
Helter-skelter
All a-swelter
The impetus is seething
In Running Town

A thousand curses
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead

Lockjaw aggressions
And buzzing irritations
Deride the friendly martian
In Running Town
Helter-skelter
All a-swelter
The impetus is seething
In Running Town
A thousand curses
Full speed ahead
Ohh, full speed ahead

If you gaze into her face
She'll glare back and drown
All refugees in the sea
Of Running Town
Of Running Town
Of Running Town

A thousand curses
Full speed ahead
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Full speed ahead

Laughter rebounds
And strangles that sound
In Running Town
Laughter rebounds
And strangles that sound
In Running Town, Running Town
In Running Town
In Running TownEmbed
