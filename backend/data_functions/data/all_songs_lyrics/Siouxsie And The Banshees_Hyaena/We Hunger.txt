We Hunger Lyrics
A ravenous greed
For a brood to feed
A lusting spawn
On a weakened fawn

Do you hunger for this
Hunger for this

Sucking leeches feel the need
Sucking dry unsaited stomach pops
Sharpened knives with flying sparks
Sagging bodies with stretch marks
And your belly aches

Do you hunger for this
Hunger for this
Hunger for this
Bled white with avarice

As the rust creeps
Corrosion seeps a rotting seed
Eat me, feed me
With your belching foul breath
Your destructive kiss death
Do you hunger for this
Hunger for this
Hunger for this
Just a taste of a sweet kiss

Shanghai'ed on a locust flight
The thirst from a vampire bite
Fills the emptiness inside
Consuming everything green-eyed
We hunger, we hunger

Do you hunger for this
Hunger for this
Hunger for this
The bliss of a sweet kiss
Hunger for this
Hunger for this
We hunger, we hunger
Do you hunger for this
Hunger for this
