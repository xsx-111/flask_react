Belladonna Lyrics
Sunrise breaks its fatal perfume
And I'm dizzy to distraction
The scented clutches of a siren's lament
Embrace the sound of enchantment

Five fathoms deep
The lovers leap
The lanterns of skin
Beckon us in
O, Belladonna
Belladonna

Daylight devours
Your unguarded hours
Burnt and charred
This bride of scars
O, Belladonna
Belladonna

Five fathoms deep
The lovers leap
The lanterns of skin
Summon us in
O, Belladonna
Belladonna
Nightfalls descent
Shrouds her intent
In a halo of sharks
And a skeleton mask
O, Belladonna

Lost in the glare
All of us stare
The patterns of pain
Scream out your name
O, Belladonna
