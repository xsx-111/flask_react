Blow the House Down LyricsWeaving in his basket chair
Twist you round a lock of hair
Made of straw, the wicker man
Made of straw, I'll blow your house down
Bishops falling from the windows
The lightening makes your hair stand on end
This dervish frenzy will make you run around
This dervish frenzy will turn your head around
Blow the house down
Blow the house down
Stretching a rubber band
Miracles trip our feet where we stand
Shift the ground, caterpillar man
Crumbling castles in the sand
Blow the house down
Down, blow the house down
Feebly we put our heads out of our foxy lairs
We feel the chill from the night scare
Standing in the storm waiting for the flash to crash
Counting seconds before we turn to ash
It's getting nearer, so nearer
It's getting nearer, blow the house down
Down, blow the house down
This dervish frenzy will turn your head around
Standing on the stairs that want to fall down
It's getting nearer, don't turn your head around
Made of straw, a lighted match, burn the house down
Weaving in his basket chair
Twist you round a lock of hair
Made of straw, the wicker man
Made of straw, I'll blow your house down
Down, blow your house down
Down, down to the ground
Turn your head around
Turn your head around
This dervish frenzy will turn your head around
Standing on the stairs that want to fall down
Down to the ground
Pillars of salt watch as it all burns down
Down to the ground
Down to the ground
Turn your head around
This dervish frenzy will turn your head around
Down, down to the ground
Blow the house down
Down to the ground
Blow the house down
Down, down to the groundEmbed
