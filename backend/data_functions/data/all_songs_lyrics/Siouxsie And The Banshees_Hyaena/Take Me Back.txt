Take Me Back Lyrics
Deep in the heart
Of a seething beast
Think of bright lights
A splendid feast
But something's missing
She's feeling low
Something's missing
She's going home

Take me back, I'm feeling low
Take me back, I'm going home
Take me back, I'm so alone
Take me back, I'm travelling home

Suspicious stranger
There's something wrong
She is changed
Ah, but this is not
She is back
But she's not home
She is back
But she's still alone
She came back
She came back
She came back
After all this time
She came back
To warning signs
All is black
When the lights are on
Nothing rhymes
It's been so long
It's been so long
So long

Deep in the heart
Of a seething beast
Think of bright lights
A splendid feast
Where you arrive
Can be home
Where you come from
Isn't always home
Isn't always home

Take me back, I'm coming home
Take me back where I belong
Take me back, I'm leaving home
Take me back, I'm coming home
Take me back
Take me back
Back where I belong
Back home
Home, home
I'm coming homeEmbed
