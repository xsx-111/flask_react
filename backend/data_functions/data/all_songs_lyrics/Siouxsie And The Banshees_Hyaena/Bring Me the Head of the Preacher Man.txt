Bring Me the Head of the Preacher Man LyricsFollowing desire in your eyes, in your eyes
You're mine, you're mine, all mine
Following the signs in your mind, your crazy mind
You're mine, you're mine, all mine
Bring me the head of the preacher man
From the sickening daze
Oh the rotting sun washes down
The moonshine boys, the vultures drool
They pluck the gold dust from his eyes
And pick his bones until they're clean
The book of sorrows, the American dreams
The book of sorrows, the American dreams
The American dreams
Following desire in your eyes, in your eyes
You're mine, you're mine, all mine
Following the signs in your mind, your mind, your mind
Oh, mind
Bring me the head of the Preacher man
On the blazing trail
Heaven holds lone star promise
El Dorado, the insane theatre
Once more we rise to drain the last of liquid sleep
The gift of chance eating the worm
The viper drops and dances
And everything stops and dances
Lone star promise, once more we rise
And everything stops and dances
We tumble down these lonely days
We tumble downEmbed
