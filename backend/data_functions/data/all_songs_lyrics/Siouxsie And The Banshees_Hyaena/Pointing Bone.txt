Pointing Bone LyricsPointing bone
Pointing bone
From the fury pit
A reek of misery
Like a trumpet groan
Tornado moan
The splendor splits
Like a golden skin
He and the wizards cry
Like humming birds
In treasure glows
Your weeping wings
And a slaughter grins
On a pleasure spike
When held on high by the riverside
Like a torn-throat child in a jackal hide
Cool water dies
Vile diamond eyes
Silent in flamingo ease
Oh, distant in troubled trance
Within a whirlpool
We're breaking our backs
The tears of the moon
The sweat of the sun
Sacrificial hearts
For a pointing bone
With a Gorgon's head
And a cloak of skulls
They're kindling fires
In open wounds
Pointing bone
Pointing bone
In a jaguar skin
Blood matted mane
Beacons blaze
Toward a waning moon
When held on high by the riverside
Like a torn-throat child
In a jackals hide
Cool water dies
Vile diamond eyes
The tears of the moon
The sweat of the sun
Sacrificial hearts
For a pointing boneEmbed
