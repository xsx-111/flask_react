Dazzle LyricsThe stars that shine and the stars that shrink
In the face of stagnation
The water runs
Before your eyes
Swallowing diamonds
A cutting throat
Your teeth when you grin
Reflecting beams on tombstones
A jamboree of surprises
Playing Russian roulette or the Lucky Dip,
A clenched fist to your heart
Coal dust on your lungs
A silver tongue for the chosen one
Heavy magnum in your side or a bloody thorn
Skating bullets on angel dust
In a dead sea of fluid mercury
Baby piano cries
Under your heavy index and thumb
Pull some strings
Let them sing
The stars that shine and the stars that shrink
In the face of stagnation
The water runs
Before your eyes
Dazzle, it's a glittering prize
Dazzle, it's a glittering prize
Before your eyes
It's a glittering prize
The stars that shine
And the stars that shrink
In the face of stagnation
The water runs
Before your eyesEmbed
