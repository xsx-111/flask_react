Swimming Horses LyricsFalling in your, falling in your
In your arms, in your arms
Fish on a line, learns to live on
Dry land
Thrown back again to drown
Kinder with poison
Then pushed down the well
Or a face burnt to hell
Feel the cruel stones
Breaking her bones
Dead before born
Words fall in ruins
But no sound
She's dying of your shame
She's maimed by your pain
He gives birth to swimming horses
He gives birth to swimming horses
Fish on a line
Walking on dry land
But back in the water to drown
We drown
Floating in sky
He gives birth to swimming horses
He gives birth to swimming horses
Take a ride on the tide
With the assassin at your side
The weightlessness underwater
Forgets in slow motion
And watches pointless tortures
He gives birth to swimming horses
He gives birth to swimming horses
Floating in sky
Like fishes can fly
Through your armsEmbed
