The Sinking Feeling Lyrics
All my books lay on the table
Waitin' to unfold
I sit and stare at my reflection
While the darkness chills my bones
My head fills like a junk shop
In desperate need of repair
The path of least resistance
Leads to the garbage heap of despair
I think I'd better get back in bed...

I'm just a symptom of the moral decay
That's gnawing at the heart of the... (Country!)
I'm just a symptom of the moral decay
That's gnawing at the heart of the... (Country!)

You can't destroy your problems
By destroying yourself
Death is not the answer
For your soul may burn in hell
My memory my fond deceiver
Is turning all my past into pain
While I'm being raped by progress
Tomorrow's world is here to stay
They wouldn't have it any other way...
I'm just a symptom of the moral decay
That's gnawing at the heart of the... (Country!)
I'm just a symptom of the moral decay
That's gnawing at the heart of the... (Country!)
I'm just a symptom of the moral decay
That's gnawing at the heart of the... (Country!)
I'm just a symptom of the moral decay
That's gnawing at the heart of the... (Country!)
(Country!)
(Country!)1Embed
