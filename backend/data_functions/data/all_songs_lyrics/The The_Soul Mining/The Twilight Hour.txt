The Twilight Hour LyricsYou're lying on your bed
And making shadows on the wall
It's almost too hot to move
Outside your window
People are driving home from work
For the weekend
But you're waiting for the phone to ring
You're gonna tell her exactly what you think
You practice getting your mouth around the words
That explain the way you feel
You've been scared to show your real self
In case she doesn't like what she sees
You've been a prostitute to humility
She's invaded your life
And you've got to live apart
In order to survive
You were emotionally independent
But starved of affection
But now you've been trapped by tenderness
And been beaten into submission
It's now way past the hour she usually phones
You've decided not to tell her your little joke
Where could she have got to?
Why is she torturing you?
You roll on your side
And run your fingers through your hair
You're scared of losing her
And facing yourself
A red sky at night may be a shepherds delight
But you're cutting chunks from your heart
And rubbing the meat into your eyes
She can't leave you now
You've given up all your friends
You're relying on her
For your independence
She can't leave you here
Alone and defenseless
You're relying on her
For your independence
You're relying on her
For your independence
You're relying on her
You're relying on her
You're relying on her
You're relying on her
You're relying on her
You're relying on her
You're relying on herEmbed
