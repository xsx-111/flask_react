Giant Lyrics
The sun is high and I'm surrounded by sand
For as far as my eyes can see
I'm strapped into a rocking chair
With a blanket all over my knees

I am a stranger to myself
And nobody knows I'm here
When I looked into my face
It wasn't myself I'd seen
But who I've tried to be

I'm thinking of things I'd hoped to forget
I'm choking to death in a sun that never sets
I clogged up my mind with perpetual greed
And turned all of my friends into enemies
And now the past has returned to haunt me

I'm scared of God and scared of Hell
And I'm caving in upon myself
I'm scared of God and scared of Hell
And I'm caving in upon myself
How can anyone know me
When I don't even know myself?
How can anyone know me
When I don't even know myself?
How can anyone know me
When I don't even know myself?
How can anyone know me
When I don't even know myself?
