Tattoos LyricsI am now the one she left
A haunted tale for someone else
A little bit about herself
Wherever she is sleeping
Flint strikes out to pierce the dark
Cause a flame from just one spark
Fill the room with smoke so harsh
She exhales a memory
The past is fadin'
Over time, but it's still hangin' on for life
I'm now her used to be
He is now the one she needs
He is now the one she leans on
She looks out at the sunset
On a quilt of rags he holds her tight
And they raise a toast of Bulleit Rye
Whiskey kills all things in time
Like things she don't remember
The past is fadin'
Over time, but it's still hanging on for life
I am now an old headstone
And to her grave I'll die alone
A testament of how she's grown
Wherever she is sleepin'
The past is fadin'
Over time, but it's still hanging on for life1Embed
