Lady May (live) LyricsI'm a stone's throw from the mill
And I'm a good walk to the river
When my workin' day is over
We'll go swim our cares away
Put your toes down in the water
And a smile across your face
And tell me that you love me
Lovely Lady May
Now I ain't the sharpest chisel
That your hands have ever held
But darlin' I could love you well
Til' the roll is called on high
I've seen my share of trouble
And I've held my weight in shame
But I'm baptized in your name
Lovely Lady May
Lord the wind can leave you shiverin'
As it waltzes o'er the leaves
It's been rushin' through my timber
Til' your love brought on the spring
Now the mountains all are blushin'
And they don't know what to say
'Cept a good long line of praises
For my lovely Lady May
Now I ain't the toughest hickory
That your ax has ever fell
But I'm a hickory just as well
I'm a hickory all the same
I came crashin' through the forest
As you cut my roots away
And I fell a good long ways
For my lovely Lady May1Embed
