Girl Lyrics
I've seen the one
To take my eye
She's my Sunday best
She'll blow my mind
Rob me blind
Then she'll take the rest
Another drink
In ya sink
Down a drunken well
Chasing stars
Catching cars
To the moon again

Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
High!

Mirror face
To her place
Head's a hazy mess
Falling down
Look a clown
Jekyll's out again
Feeling sick
Lunatic
Beat myself up well
Call the cars
Fuck the stars
Get me down from hell
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
High!Embed
