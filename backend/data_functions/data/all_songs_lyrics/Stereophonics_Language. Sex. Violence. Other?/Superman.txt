Superman Lyrics
You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you

You look like Jesus on an aeroplane
Ya head's against the window pane
You got opinions but you ain't got news
You got good laughs but when it suits you

You turn it on like a leaking tap
Dripping dropping people drop of a hat
You gotta mouth but you ain't got guts
That drunken mouth you should keep it shut

You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you

Superman on an aeroplane
Sitting next to Lois Lane
You got that woman but you want her gone
So you can sleep with a teenage blonde
You wear a mask, wear an armoured suit
Can't get to you with the gun I shoot
Ya play your cards close to your chest
Because ya poker face is a dreary mess

You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you

Superman on an aeroplane
Sitting next to Lois Lane
You got that woman but you want her gone
So you can fuck a teenage blonde

You turn it on like a leaking tap
Dripping dropping people drop of a hat
You gotta mouth but you ain't got guts
That drunken mouth you should keep it shut3Embed
