Pedalpusher Lyrics
Gotta get in on the scene hun
Voice activate machine
Got ya hair in a haircut
You gotta fill up the dream
Got ya finger on the pulse babe
Got your rock n roll on?
You wanna screw driver too now
I hear they're fun on

You got it all this side up
But ya ain't got it down!
Push the pedal now

Activate your sweet voice babe
Let your world come out
Get ya head off the chopping block
Get ya ouija board out
Got ya rubber on ya pencil
In case you make a mistake
I hope ya got it all down babe
I'd hate to think you're a fake

You got it all this side up
But ya ain't got it down!
Push the pedal nowEmbed
