Brother Lyrics
Won't you take your words, brother?
Won't you mind your world, brother?
I find you so offensive, punk

Won't you take my word, brother?
I tell you no lies, now leave me, brother
You disturb me, turn me, hurt me, sister

You walk right up to me
Abuse me on the street
Like a cannonball killing me
You got it wrong brother, can't you see?
Can't you see?

Won't you walk on home, brother?
Won't you live and learn, brother?
Think you're a poet? A know it? At your lowest?
Have you lost it? Did you toss it? Double crossed it?
Are you a loser? No one to choose ya? Accuser?

You walk right up to me
Abuse me on the street
Like a cannonball killing me
You got it wrong brother, can't you see? Can't you see?
Don't you push me brother! Don't you push me brother!Embed
