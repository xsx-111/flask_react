Lolita Lyrics
I stepped out off the train at dawn
Walked along an open road
To find you
You made beds at the gold motel
Sold junk at the carousel
To bind you

Lolita
You make my wheel, set me free
Won't you come home with me?
Lolita
You make my wheel, set me free
Won't you come home with me?

We used to meet at the waterfall
Pink heather on the falling wall
Nothing to prove
Drank beer from a stolen can
Smoke cigarettes when we can
Because we like to

Lolita
You make my wheel, set me free
Won't you come home with me?
Lolita
You make my wheel, set me free
Won't you come home with me?
Memories tangled up the spokes that
Make my wheel
Make my wheel
Oh everything has gone wrong!

I left you at the gold motel
Selling junk at the carousel
That bound you down
Can't find you now

Lolita
You make my wheel, set me free
Won't you come home with me?
Lolita
You make my wheel, set me free
Won't you come home with me?Embed
