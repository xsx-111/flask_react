Fastest Horse in Town Lyrics
I've been wasting all my best days
I've been besting all my worst ways
I've been thinking about all the things
I should have never left behind
Oughta be watching the children play
In the yard I never see I should be mowing today
Instead of searching for ways to say
All the words I can't find

Everybody's trying to be the next someone
But look at me, I'm trying to be the first something

Can't make the dollars make sense
Can't keep the squirrels off the fence
And shoes are coming loose on the fastest horse in town
But that old horse just keeps on running
And if he falls, they'll put him down
They been keeping him out on the track
Running him ragged just to pile up their stack
And making sure he's all spent by the time he gets back

Everybody's trying to be the next someone
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something

Everybody's trying to be the next someone
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something


Well, you know what I want?
We need, we need a gift card for
Are y'all listening to me? This is what I want
I want a gift card from God
He can keep it all
I want a gift card from GodEmbed
