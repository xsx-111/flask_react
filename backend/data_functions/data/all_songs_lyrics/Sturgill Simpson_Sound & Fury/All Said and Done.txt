All Said and Done Lyrics
Spent the last year going out of my mind
Looking for reasons I could never find
Until I put my finger on it and saw every sign
Take all you can get, keep your fingers off of mine

Sitting in the tower without a clue or care
Anchored by opportunists hangin' off of my hair
Handing silver ladders out to anyone who dares
To climb all the way up to the top just to get kicked down the stairs

Bein' pulled a million ways all at the same time
It's enough to make anyone go insane
When you find yourself forgetting all your own rhymes
And givin' up on dreams floating 'round inside your brain


Bein' pulled a million ways all at the same time
It's enough to make anyone go insane
When you find yourself forgetting all your own rhymes
And givin' up on the dreams floating 'round inside your brain
Keep staring at the pages, coming up with the same lines
It's all been said and done by now, two or three timesEmbed
