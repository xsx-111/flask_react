Sing Along Lyrics
Words can stab as deep as night
And cut like a razored thorn
Bitter air and the winds of spite
Like the cold of winter's scorn
Leaves may fall on sleeping ground
But the wind sweeps them away
Like hurt lovers in the final round
What once was is now decayed

I can't go on livin' alone now that you're gone

A single strand of spider's weave
Just dancin' in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave
You are my only one
Compromise is made out of peace
But history's made out of violence
After the war of the words has ceased
All that's left is the deafenin' silence

I can't go on livin' alone now that you're gone
You done me wrong, so here's your song
Now sing along, baby

Well, I know you know that you're killin' me
But it's worth it just to see you smile
Tell 'em to carve my name in the barstool, baby
You know I'm gonna be here a while
A single strand of spider's weave
Just dancin' in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave
You are my only one

I can't go on livin' alone now that you're gone
You done me wrong, so here's your song
Now sing along2Embed
