Last Man Standing Lyrics
I'm always double-dippin', gulpin' while they're sippin'
Got shit to do, no time to snooze
Gotta sell out just to buy in, shit the bed you're gonna die in
And your destiny is yours to lose
You're either part of the solution or you're part of the problem
Find 'em young and unknown, climb on their shoulders and rob 'em

Time to turn on the heat, it's gettin' cold on the street
And man, that shit'll get you down
It's "fuck all of y'all" season, don't give me a reason
To watch your house burn to the ground
And light my new joint off the flames
I never learned how to play, so I broke the game
Now, I'm flippin' the board with the ink and the sword
And walkin' 'round crossin' off names
I'm gonna ride off into the sunset
While it all burns to hell behind me
Somewhere I haven't been yet
Somewhere they can't even see

Well, you know daddy likes his alone time
That's why he doesn't have any friends
Yeah, but watch and see, you'll be lookin' at me
The last man standing in the end
Oh, it's gettin' sticky, got no time to be gettin' picky
About the who, what, when or the where
You're sellin' tugs on a pickle with a backdoor tickle
'Fore you even know how you got there
Well, I'm not gonna say what you want me to say
Plenty people pandering already anyway
Don't even try because I already did it
Bullshit sells, don't you ever forget it
Going full speed is the greatest escape
Slamming on the gas, I can't find the brake
I don't know how much more I can take
Well, I'm gonna keep going 'til I find out
Well, your mama didn't raise nobody's dum-dum
Not tryin' to win a medal for bein' the most hum-drum

You know daddy needs his alone time
That's why he doesn't have any friends
Yeah, but watch and see, you'll be lookin' at me
The last man standing in the end
