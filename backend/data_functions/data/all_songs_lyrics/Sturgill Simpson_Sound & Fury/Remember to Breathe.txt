Remember to Breathe Lyrics
I go out late at night just to see what I can find
Stayin' in the shadows where the light don't ever shine
Having one-way conversations with the darkness in my mind
He does all the talking 'cause I'm the quiet kind

So peel it off, pull 'em down
Let me see it, turn around
Just lay back, let it happen
And remember to breathe

Staying off the radar like a bomber on the run
Do another lap around the target just for fun
Stayin' quiet, keeping calm until I find the one
Feel the wave wash over me when the deed is done

So peel it off, pull 'em down
Let me see it, turn around
Just lay back, let it happen
And remember to breathe

Well, just lay back
Oh, just lay back
Oh, just lay back
Oh, just lay back
Oh, just lay back
Oh, just lay back, oh, just lay back
And remember to breathe
Well, just lay back now, let it happen
And remember to breatheEmbed
