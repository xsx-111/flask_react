A Good Look Lyrics
The Star of David don't belong to David at all
He borrowed it from Peter just so he could pay off Paul
But Peter copyrighted the star and now he owns the claim
But a star is still a star by any other name

Well, now everybody's worried 'bout a good look
But they need to be worried 'bout a good hook
Instead of skippin' straight to the last page
In that ol' rationalization book

I write my poems in the dirt with an oily rag
I have to wear a gas mask just so I don't gag
I got a SOCOM Scout and twenty extra mags
And a couple severed heads in my bug-out bag

Well, everybody's worried 'bout a good look
But they need to be worried 'bout a good hook
Instead of skipping straight to the last page
In that ol' rationalization book

Why you gettin' pissed 'cause you're gettin' discovered?
Are you talking all that shit just to get on the cover?
Well then, how're you gonna eat when you're bitin' the hand?
Well, you know they don't like it when you take a stand
So enjoy it while you can
And say hi to all the boys in the band
'Cause it's all over now
Just a flash in the pan
Well, now everybody's worried 'bout a good look
But they need to be worried 'bout a good hook
Instead of skipping straight to the last page
In that ol' rationalization book1Embed
