Best Clockmaker on Mars Lyrics
Wanna grow old and die with you
Wanna make babies 'til you say you're through
Go to bed and wake up when you tell me to
Turn off all the TVs, there ain't nothin' new

Wanna wake up every day and be the best clockmaker on Mars

Some days, I hate everything I am
But your love holds a mirror to me
Shows me a love I can understand
And makes sense of the world I see

Gonna wake up every day and be the best clockmaker on Mars

Wanna grow old and die with you
Wanna make babies 'til you say you're through
Go to bed and wake up when you tell me to
Turn off all the TVs, there ain't nothin' new

Wanna wake up every day and be the best clockmaker on Mars
Gonna wake up every day and be the best clockmaker on MarsEmbed
