Make Art Not Friends Lyrics
Looking out the window at a world on fire
It's plain to see, the end is near
I've seen all the sights
I'm tired of the lights
So you can let me off right here
This town's getting crowded
The truth's been shrouded
I think it's time to change up the sound
Yeah, the wheels keep turning
The flames gettin' higher
Another cycle goes around

Face in the mirror's all skin and bones
Bloodshot eyes and a heart of stone
Never again, rather be alone
Think I'm gonna just stay home
And make art, not friends

I love saying "no" to all the "yes" men
Just to see the look on their face
Love how everybody knows what's best
But nobody knows their place
Sucker every second, stack 'em up to the sky
For every winner, there's a hundred that die
So you get yours, and stay out of mine
Here's to the memories, where do I sign?
Face in the mirror's all skin and bones
Bloodshot eyes and a heart of stone
Never again, rather be alone
Think I'm gonna just stay home
And make art, not friends

Oh, it's getting hard to find a good friend
So close the door behind you
Before any more come in
Nobody writes, nobody calls
Nobody bother, 'cause I'm over it all

Face in the mirror's all skin and bones
Bloodshot eyes and a heart of stone
Never again, rather be alone
Think I'm gonna just stay home
And make art, not friends1Embed
