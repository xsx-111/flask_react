Breathe In, Breathe Out LyricsKeep staying in my soul
I keep fighting, fighting it
Mama said you must be strong
Healing slow, feeling so low
I can't eat, I can't grow
I can't heal my soul
God, it's been so long
There must be some kind of light to come
Unless I go home, lost in oblivion
There must be some kind of light to come
Let myself find out there's more
Let my heart find out there's more
If there's more
If there's more
Keep saying write my songs
I keep crying, crying
Love has taken all of my energy
And it's brought up all my melancholy
I just found I can't breathe
Like they say, like a song
I just found I can't breathe
Like they say, going somewhere2Embed
