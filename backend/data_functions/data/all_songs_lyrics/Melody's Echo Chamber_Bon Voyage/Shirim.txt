Shirim Lyrics
I'm feeling kind of low
I've listened to your song
I wish I enjoyed it 'til it reached my soul
You try to read my thoughts
I hope you don't get close
Promise it would hurt me more than you know

My feelings overflow
I had fun before
I decided more, after you let me go
Endless, endless flaws
All I do is for us
You do miss me but you won't

It seems like I'm getting old
Feels like our sun has gone
It seems like you're almost gone
It feels like it's all my fault

If you try to read my thoughts
I hope you don't get close
Promise it would hurt me more than you know
False alarm

It seems like I'm getting old
It feels like our sun has gone
It seems like your love is gone
It feels like it's all my fault6Embed
