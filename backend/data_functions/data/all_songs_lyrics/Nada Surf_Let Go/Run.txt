Run LyricsRun
I run to fill the gaps I spot ahead
The traps I know I've set
For myself
To fall into and hide
I hide to spare myself from feeling shame
Learning from mistakes
When I know
It's me, who's to blame
Darkness ran aground
On the day that lost was found
I saw you there
I saw you there
I
I couldn't split the doubts of loneliness
From the pain of emptiness
But you helped
Figure out
Which was which
Which brings me to the part that's hard to say
The part that sounds so lame:
?, we are one
And the same
Darkness ran aground
On the day that lost was found
I saw you there
I saw you there
You're pulling up the ground
I had to turn around
I saw you there
I saw you there
If
You need me like an island needs the sea
Does that mean I should leave
Would you grow
Beyond all
Of your dreams
That you got from a sleep at such a speed
Sowing thirsty seeds
While kissing
The palm
Of your hand
Darkness ran aground
On the day that lost was found
I saw you there
Saw you there
Like you didn't care
With tassles in your hair
I saw you there
I saw you there
Show me all around
You're polishing the town
I saw you there
I saw you there
I knew right there and then
We'd never know the end
You took me with your hand
We're going to my denEmbed
