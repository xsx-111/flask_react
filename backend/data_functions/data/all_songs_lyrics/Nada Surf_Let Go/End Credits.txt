End Credits LyricsAll of a sudden I
Lost the lie
I let myself believe
I'd be a brand new guy
But holy shit I'm just a door
Well...
I helped you to see out
Of your hole
Got the gas on in your house
Because you turned to coal
When you're back up on
Your feet
You'll move right past me
You're makin' plans with my friends
I know they're great
It's a little late to let me down
Oh no... I better go
You set the tone
You just don't know
You're scratching it in stone
I better wash my clothes
Take a bath
Move up and down the hall
Untill I find my class
So I can be myself again
This movie has gotta end... (x3)
Do do..
Do do do do do do(x3)
This movie has gotta end... (x5)
Oh... yeah...(x4) (fades out)Embed
