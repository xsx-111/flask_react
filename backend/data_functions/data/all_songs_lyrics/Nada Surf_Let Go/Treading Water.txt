Treading Water Lyrics
Movies like zoos
Try another me and I will try another you
Or put my arms around you, like I think you want me to
But tell me what you're thinking
I so often misconstrue

Treading water
Treading white wine
Seeing borders
Seeing straight lines
I get these feelings that I don't have much time
Always rushing, always late
Always rushing, always late
Always late

Movies like zoos
I talk to missionaries when they're standing at my door
They tell me what I should be reading
I still can't see what for
We both stand there politely, trying to change each other's core

When other angels float by
They seem likely to fall from the sky
What I want is difficult
I must try
I see traces when you walk
And other voices when you talk
When you talk
When other angels float by
They seem likely to fall from the sky
What I want is difficult
I must try
I see traces when you walk
Treading water
Treading white wine
Seeing borders
Seeing straight lines
I get these feelings that I don't have much time
Always rushing, always late
Always rushing, always late
Always late
Always late
I'm always rushing
Always late
Always late
Always late
Always late
I'm always rushing
I'm always rushing
Always lateEmbed
