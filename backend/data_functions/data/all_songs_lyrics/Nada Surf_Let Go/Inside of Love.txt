Inside of Love Lyrics
Watching terrible TV, it kills all thought
Getting spacier than an astronaut
Making out with people I hardly know or like
I can't believe what I do late at night

I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above

Only when we get to see the aerial view
Will the patterns show, we'll know what to do
I know the last page so well, I can't read the first
So I just don't start, it's getting worse

I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I can't find my way in
I try again and again

I'm on the outside of love
Always under or above
I can't find my way in
I try again and again
I'm on the outside of love
Always under or above
Must be a different view
To be a me with a you

I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
Of course I'll be alright
I just had a bad night
I had a bad night2Embed
