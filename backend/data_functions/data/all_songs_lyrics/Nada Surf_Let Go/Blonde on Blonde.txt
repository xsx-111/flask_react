Blonde on Blonde Lyrics
Cats and dogs are coming down
14th street is gonna drown
Everyone else rushing around

I've got Blonde on Blonde
On my portable stereo
It's a lullaby
From a giant golden radio

I've got no time I want to lose
To people with something to prove
What can you do but let them talk
And make your way down the block

I've got Blonde on Blonde
On my portable stereo
It's a lullaby
From a giant golden radio
I've got Blonde on Blonde
On my portable stereo
It's a lullaby
From a giant golden radio
I've got Blonde on Blonde
On my portable stereo
It's a lullaby
From a giant golden radio
It's a lullaby
From a giant golden radio
It's a lullaby
From Wonder golden radio
It's a lullaby
From Wonder Woman's radio
It's a lullaby
It's a lullaby

It's a lullaby
It's a lullaby
It's a lullaby
It's a lullabyEmbed
