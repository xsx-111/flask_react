No Quick Fix Lyrics
There’s no quick fix
You gotta take your licks
Strange times, long lines
There are no clean cups
You gotta mess it up
To see why you cry

I can’t stay home at night
I’m drawn out like a moth to lamplight
Do I speak or hold you tight?
The words were voted out by a landslide

Come on, now
You've got to try it out
You’re killing time
You’re killing mine

Don’t go
I’ll never know
When you’re away
I sleep all day
Nothing works
And thinking hurts
You belong to me
In my dreams
I can’t stay home at night
I’m drawn out like a moth to lamplight
Do I speak or hold you tight?
The words were voted out by a landslide

Home at night
Lamplight
Hold you tight
Landslide
Home at night
