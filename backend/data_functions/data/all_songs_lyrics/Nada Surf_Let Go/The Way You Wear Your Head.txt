The Way You Wear Your Head Lyrics
Don't push me, 'cause I'll fall in love
With whatever you just said
Don't push me, 'cause I'll fall in love
With the way you wear your head

Out in the corner
You're glowing white
Out in the corner
You're glowing white

I want to want you
I need to need you
I'd love to love you
I want to want you
I need to need you
I'm begging to beg you

Out in the corner
You're glowing white
Out in the corner
You're glowing white
I'd like to say good-bye to a complicated mind
But when I walk and wave
I'm stalked all day
By California lives
And things I didn't try
And ways you were unkind
And the strangest colored eyes

Out in the corner
You're glowing white
Out in the corner
You're glowing white
Out in the corner
Out in the corner
Out in the corner
You're glowing whiteEmbed
