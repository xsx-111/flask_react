Fruit Fly Lyrics
Left some food wrapped up
In a plastic bag
On the kitchen table
Way too long
Sat down to eat
Next to the bag
I was too tired
To throw it out
I saw a swarm of fruit flies
I took the bag downstairs
When I came back
They were still there
Flying jerky patterns
Like snowflakes in the air

I'm sorry you've got nowhere to go
I'm sorry you've got nowhere to go

Left, straight
Right, straight
I can't find a reason
I know I'll keep going but
I can't find a reason
Nothing looks right
Nothing smells right
I can't land
Geometric patterns
Smearing out of control
Only have enough gas left
For the beer can to the bowl
What can you do but go on?
What can you do but go on?
What can you do but go on?

Oh no, you make your own mistakes
I cannot bring them back to you
Oh no, you make your own mistakes
I cannot measure up to you
Oh no, you make your own mistakes
I cannot bring them back to you
Oh no, you make your own mistakes
I cannot measure up to youEmbed
