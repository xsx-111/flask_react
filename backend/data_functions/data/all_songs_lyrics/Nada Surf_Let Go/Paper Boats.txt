Paper Boats Lyrics
Sit on a train, reading a book
Same damn planet, every time I look
Try to relax and slow my heartbeat
Only works when I'm dead asleep
Been thinking and drinking, all over the town
Must be gearing up for some kind of meltdown

All I am is a body floating downwind
All I am is a body floating downwind

"What's wrong?"
"Nothing."
"Are you sure nothing's wrong?"
"Yeah."
"But you're sad about something?"
"Yeah."
"So tell me what?"
"I don't know."
I can't tell you
I can't tell you
I can't tell you
I can't tell you
All I am is a body floating downwind
All I am is a body floating downwind

Sit on a train, reading a book
Same damn planet, every time I look
Try to relax and slow my heartbeat
Only works when I'm dead asleep
Been thinking and drinking, all over the town
Must be gearing up for some kind of meltdown

As the express train passes the local
It moves by just like a paper boat
Although it weighs a million pounds
I swear, it almost seems to float
And as we pass by each other
Our heads all full of bother
We can't look, we can't stop
We can't think, we can't stop
'Cause we're stuck in our own paths
And it's the way it always lasts
And I need something more from you

All I am is a body floating downwind
All I am is a body floating downwind
Floating downwindEmbed
