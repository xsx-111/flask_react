Nobody Knows LyricsI may get around...I may laugh alot...
Now you'd think that I'd be happy with the life I got
Nobody knows...nobody sees
Ain't nobody really knows the inner side o'me...
I may seem secure...I could have it made...
You might think you see a lucky man who made the grade
Nobody knows what dreams I see
Ain't nobody really sure just who they wanna be...
But everybody has a place and time...
A chance to live...a need to find
We all got somethin' that we care about
I propose you find it out...
It's not in a book...or a magazine...
Or the stars who guide our fortunes on the silver screen
Nobody knows...it's up to me
Ain't nobody who can say it like it outght to be...
I see my future at the rainbow's end
Happy hours...timeless friends
And if I ever chance to find my way
Rest assured...I will stay...
You may see your life as a compromise
You may live to find the promise dancin' in your eyes
Nobody knows...it's meant to be...
Let the magic of the moment say it all to me
(Dedicated to the life of John Lennon)Embed
