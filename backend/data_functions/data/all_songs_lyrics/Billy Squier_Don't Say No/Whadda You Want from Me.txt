Whadda You Want from Me LyricsDown in the dungeon I'm havin' a hard time
And I get my love on condition and my Dewar's without lime
And up in the tower you're countin' the fault lines
I say, I am who I am, whadda you want from me?
Long distance warfare from over the phone lines
Terminal airfare, I'm crossin' the red line
Can't tell the diff'rence 'tween a "Wait" and a "Walk" sign
But you know who I am, whadda you want from me? Nah, yeah
You preach forgiveness but once in a dog's day
No, but nobody listens to everythin' you say
You want the business, you have it your own way
But you know who I am, whadda you want from me?
Now, I can't see no maybe
I can't see it at all
Now, I seen through you, baby
You wanna have it all
You take me to the wall, ow
Whadda you want from me?
Whadda you want from me?
Whadda you want from me?
Whadda you want from me?
'Cause said I am who I am, whadda you want from me?
Whadda you want from me?
Whadda you want from me?
Whadda you want from me?
I said, you know who I am, whadda you want from me?
Whadda you want from me?
Whadda you want from me?
Whadda you want from me?
I said, you know who I am, whadda you want?
I done what I can take what you want
I am who I am, whadda you want from me?Embed
