Too Daze Gone LyricsWalkin' through the streets just the other day
Caught up in the traffic--I can never get away
Runnin' here, runnin' there
No satisfaction anywhere
I do my work--ain't enough anymore
It takes the mornin' after to forget the night before
Too daze gone...too daze gone
I'm broke down, insufferable--my mind is on the blink
It's later than you think and I'm too daze gone
Went to see a friend just the other day
Had a drink or two and we blew the night away
Takin' in another show...how we live I'll never know
I can't remember the things that we said
Now all I got is this achin' in my head
Too daze gone...too daze gone
I'm broke down, insufferable--my mind is on the blink
It's later than you think and I'm too daze gone
Gone through the games that you want me to play
Gone past the rules that you put in my way
Racin' past your limit--ain't no right and wrong
Past the point of carin'--too daze gone
Couldn't raise my head just to save the day
I do my penance--try to keep the world at bay
Outa sight, outa mind...ills you don't expect to find
I learned my lesson a thousand times too
Don't make no impression--one thing I can do
Too daze gone...1Embed
