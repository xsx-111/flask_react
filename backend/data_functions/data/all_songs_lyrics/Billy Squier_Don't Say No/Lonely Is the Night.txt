Lonely Is the Night LyricsLonely is the night when you find yourself alone
Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own
Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call
You feel the time is right, say, the writing's on the wall, yeah
And it's a high time to fight when the walls are closing in
A-call it what you like, it's time you got to win
Lonely, lonely, lonely, your spirit's sinking down
You find you're not the only stranger in this town
Red lights, green lights, stop and go jive
Headlines, deadlines jamming your mind
You been stealing shots from the side
Let your feelings go for a ride
There's danger out tonight, the man is on the prowl
Get the dynamite, the boys are set to prowl
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call
Are you ready for a fight? Do you wanna take it all?
Slowdown, showdown, waiting on line
Showtime, no time, changing your mind
Streets are ringing, march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down
Somebody's watching you, baby, so much you can do
Nobody's stopping you, baby, from making it too
One glimpse'll show you now, baby, what the music can do
One kiss'll show you now, baby, it can happen to you
No more sleeping, wasting our time
Midnight creeping's first on our mind
No more lazing around the TV
You'll go crazy, come out with me
Say you're lonely?
Come out
Lonely is the night
A-you don't have to be lonely
Come out
Lonely is the night5Embed
