Imagine A Man LyricsImagine a man
Not a child of any revolt
But a plain man tied up in life
Imagine the sand
Running out as he struts
Parading and fading, ignoring his wife
Imagine a road
So long looking backwards
You can't see where it really began
Imagine a load
So large and so smooth
That against it a man is an ant
Then you will see the end
You will see the end
Imagine events
That occur everyday
Like a shooting or raping or a simple act of deceit
Imagine a fence
Around you as high as Prudential
Casting shadows, you can't see your feet
Imagine a girl
With long flowing hair
And the body of chalky perfection and truth
Imagine a past
That you wish you had lived
Full of heroes and villains and fools
And you will see the end
You will see the end
And you will see the end
You will see the end
Oh yeah
Imagine a man
Not a child of any revolt
But a man of today feeling new
Imagine a soul
So old it is broken
And you know your invention is you
And you will see the end
You will see the end
You will see the end
You will see the end
Oh yeah1Embed
