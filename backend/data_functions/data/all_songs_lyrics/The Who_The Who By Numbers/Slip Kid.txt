Slip Kid Lyrics
(One, two, three, four)
(Five, six, stay intact)

I've got my clipboard, textbooks
Lead me to the station
Yeah, I'm off to the civil war
I've got my kit bag, my heavy boots
I'm running in the rain
Going to run 'til my feet are raw

Slip kid, slip kid, second generation
I'm a soldier at thirteen
Slip kid, slip kid, realization
There's no easy way to be free
No easy way to be free

(It's a hard, hard world)
I left my doctor's prescription
Bungalow behind me
I left the door ajar
I left my vacuum flask
Full of hot tea and sugar
Left the keys right in my car
Slip kid, slip kid, second generation
Only half way up the tree
Slip kid, slip kid, I'm a relation
I'm a soldier at sixty-three
No easy way to be free

(Slip kid, slip kid)
Keep away, old man (Slip kid)
You won't fool me
You and your history (Slip kid)
Won't rule me
You might've been a fighter (Slip kid)
But admit you failed
I'm not affected by your blackmail
You won't blackmail me

I've got my clipboard, textbooks
Lead me to the station
Yeah, I'm off to the civil war
I've got my kit bag, my heavy boots
I'm running in the rain
Going to run 'til my feet are raw
Slip kid, slip kid, slip out of trouble
Slip over here and set me free
Slip kid, slip kid, second generation
You're sliding down the hill like me

No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free...Embed
