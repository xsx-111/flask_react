They Are All In Love Lyrics
Where do you walk on sunny times
When the rivers gleam and the buildings shine
How do you feel going up hallowed halls
And the summer clothes brighten gloomy halls

And they're all in love 

Where do you fit in zzzzip magazine
Where the past is the hero and the present a queen
Just tell me right now where do you fit in
With blood in your eye and a passion for gin


Hey, goodbye all you punks
Stay young and stay high
Hand me my checkbook
Then I'll crawl out to die
But like a woman in childbirth
Grown ugly in a flash
I've seen magic and pain
Now I'm recycling trash
