Parallel Universe Lyrics
Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first
I'm underwater where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in a sea, just like me

Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

Staring straight up into the sky, oh, my, my
A solar system that fits in your eye, microcosm
You could die but you're never dead, spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head, fields of space kid

Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

Psychic changes are born in your heart, entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same, bless your heart, girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on, salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song, I am with you
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything11Embed
