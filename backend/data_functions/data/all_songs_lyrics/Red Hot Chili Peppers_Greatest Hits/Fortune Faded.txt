Fortune Faded Lyrics
They say in chess you've got to
Kill the queen and then you've made it
Oh, I, do you?
A funny thing the king who
Gets himself assassinated
Hey now, every time I lose altitude

You took a town by storm
The mess you made was nominated
Oh, I, do you?
Now put away your welcome
Soon you'll find you've overstayed it
Hey now, every time I lose altitude

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded

The medicated state of mind, you've found is overrated
Oh, I, do you?
You saw it all come down and now it's time to imitate it
Hey now, every time I lose altitude
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded

Come on, God, do I seem bulletproof?

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded5Embed
