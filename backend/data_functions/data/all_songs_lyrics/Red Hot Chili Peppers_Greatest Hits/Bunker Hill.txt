Bunker Hill Lyrics
She
She
She

Lock the bus undo the chain
Getting all too hot, gotta head on Fifth and Main
I look like you I feel the same
You don't even know my name
I got this tied up to my cell
Well everybody's gone to the everybody shell

Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you, I said lordy lordy

I don't like blood into the chain
There ain't an element that stays off in my brain
A dirty sun will burn away
Do you even want to stay

Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you, I said lordy lordy
Where'd ya get that bruise, do you want me to
Take your body
I must still, taking your bod away

Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you. I said lordy lordy
Where'd ya get that bruise, do you want me to
Take your body
I must still, taking your bod away
