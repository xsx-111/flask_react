My Friends Lyrics
My friends are so depressed
I feel the question of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will

Ex-girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate on a prison phone
They want to give her seven years
For being sad

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

My friends are so distressed
And standing on the brink of emptiness
No words I know of to express
This emptiness

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
Imagine me
Taught by tragedy
Release is peace

I heard a little girl
And what she said was something beautiful
To give your love no matter what
Was what she said

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself8Embed
