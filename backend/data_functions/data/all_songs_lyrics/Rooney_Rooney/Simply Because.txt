Simply Because LyricsCan you guess
Why I haven't called you back?
Well, I said I'm screening calls
Even your calls
Why am I
Such a bad guy?
I'm just doing other things
Like you do other things
I could never really love you
Simply because, simply because
I could never really love you
Simply because
Of the trust (x2)
You're up all night
Fixing your hair
But you're not satisfied
With that I'm satisfied
I'm doing things
Like I said before
I'm not partying
I'm parting from the non-creative
Yeah
I could never really love you
Simply because
Of the trust (x2)
You've lost my love
Oh yeah
I could never really love you
Simply because, simply because
(x3)
I could never really love you
Simply because
Of the trust (x2)
You've lost my love
Oh yeahEmbed
