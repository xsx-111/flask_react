Make Some Noise LyricsSad girl
There's no need to feel sad girl
Sad girl
Life isn't so bad
You know
You don't know
You don't know
That all your silly talkin'
Won't get you where you wanna be
So I suggest you take your case straight out of this reality
Oh, come on
You can do better
Than listenin' to nameless vintage records
Sad girl, you have got a name, haven't you?
Come on, come on, come on
Let's make some noise
Let's make some noise tonight (x2)
Posh girl
I bet all skins in that bag, girl
Yeah, posh girl
Congrats, the skirt's in the mags, girl
Come on
You can do better
Than buying overpriced studded leather
Posh girl, you have got a place, haven't you?
Come on, come on, come on
Let's make some noise
Let's make some noise tonight (x2)
Let's make some noise (x4)
Come on, come on, come on
Let's make some noise (x2)
Oh yeah
Come on, come on, come on
Let's make some noise (x2)
Come on, come on, come on
Let's make some noise
We will make some noise (background vocals) (x3)
Come, come on, come on
Let's make some noiseEmbed
