That Girl Has Love LyricsI don't know a lot about her
But she, she knew a lot about me
Her family seemed to love her
If what they say is true
Her friends all shared the good times
Man, that girl has love
That girl has...
I, I didn't have a clue then
That a kiss
Would change my whole life again
She walked into my room
When I was all alone
She told me I would date her from
September till December
She doesn't know
Things will never be the same again
She'll always be 17
That girl has love
She kept all the pain inside
Now she has got nothing to hide
At such a young age
She took her own life
Now she's seeing things that come in
Our dreams at night
She's a dreamer
She doesn't know
Things will never be the same again
She'll always be 17
That girl has love (love)
That was too real to ever be fake
That was too strong to be ever be forgotten
That girl has love
Love, love, love, love, love, love...
She doesn't know
Things will never be the same again
She'll always be 17
That girl has (x2)
That girl has loveEmbed
