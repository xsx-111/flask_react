Popstars LyricsHey baby, you've hit me again one more time
You said bye bye bye bye bye goodbye
Well, I don't want to be with you tonight
Forever
Do you understand my monologue?

These are the words of the popstars
And these are the words of the unsophisticated money machines
For the killers of rock and roll
Hey digital, you're nothing but a bitch on the strings
You'll be back milking cows before you cash the check
I'll just wait around 'till you fade away like the rest
Like the best of the best
Do you understand my monologue?

These are the words of the popstars
And these are the words of the unsophisticated money machines
For the killers of rock and roll
Do you understand my monologue?
These are the words of the popstars
These are the words of the
These are the words of the popstars
These are the words of the unsophisticated money machines
For the killers of rock and rollEmbed
