Daisy Duke LyricsI want to know
All there's to know about you
I want you to know
Nothing about me, although...
I'll give you a taste
When you think that you know me
I'll blow you away
So baby, bow down Daisy Duke
You don't know me so well
I think you know that now
I'm unbreakable
There's no need for fragile stickers
You're too young for me
But I can keep a secret
I'm in total control
Of the situation
Bow down Daisy Duke
Sit on my couch
Snuggle with me through the hard night
I don't bite, baby
I'll be good to you in the morning
Don't you say no to me, baby
Big mistake
I'll throw you away
So baby, bow down Daisy Duke
You don't know me so well
I think you know that now
I'm unbreakable
There's no need for fragile stickers
You're too young for me
But I can keep a secret
I'm in total control
Of the situation
Bow down Daisy Duke (x3)
I'm much too rough
With the way that I phrase things
I'm sorry for cuffing you
To my bathtub
Bow down Daisy Duke (x2)
You don't know me so well
I think you know that now
I'm unbreakable
There's no need for fragile stickers
You're too young for me
But I can keep a secret
I'm in total control
Of the situation
Bow down Daisy Duke (x3)Embed
