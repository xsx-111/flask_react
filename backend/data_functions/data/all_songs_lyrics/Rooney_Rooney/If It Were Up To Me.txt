If It Were Up To Me LyricsShe doesn't have the answer yet
The answer yet
I'm breathing down her neck
Maybe I should give her time
If it were up to me
She would know that
She'll be the one
When I'm dead
Will use my bed
And she'll spend her life
Thinking of us and making a fuss
If it were up to me
She would know that our love (our love)
Is the best love (best love)
If it were up to me
Yes, our love (our love)
Is real love
So just let it be
I want you to know
I've done our charts and it says
That we work as one
Like the Jackson Five
And the Temptations
If it were up to me
She would know that our love (our love)
Is the best love (best love)
If it were up to me
Yes, our love (our love)
Is real love
So just let it be
Well, your mother likes my smile
And your father likes my lifestyle
Should I ask them what I asked you
To get the answer?
Yes, to get the answer?
It's easy (easy) (x3)
Oh, it's easy (easy)
Your mother likes my smile
And your father likes my lifestyle
Should I ask them what I asked you
To get the answer?
Yes, to get the answer?
'Cause our love (our love)
Is the best love (best love)
If it were up to me
Yes, our love (our love)
Oh, it's real love
So just let it be
It's easy (easy) (x2)
Oh, it's easyEmbed
