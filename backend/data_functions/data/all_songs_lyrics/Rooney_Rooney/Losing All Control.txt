Losing All Control LyricsI'm losing you
I'm losing all control
Just let me be
Let me be alone for now
I wanna be alone tonight
*Chorus*
Once again we've gone off track
And lost all hope for coming back
It's time to restart and then
Try all over again
It's time to work
The work is useless now
Oh can't you see
Your help is lost in me
I wanna be alone tonight (night)
*Chorus*
Yeah try all over
We've lost all hope for coming back
We've lost all hope for coming back
We've lost all hope for coming back
Lost all hope
For coming back
*Chorus*Embed
