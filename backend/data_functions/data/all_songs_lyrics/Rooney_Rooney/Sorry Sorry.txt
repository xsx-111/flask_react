Sorry Sorry LyricsWell, I met this girl on a
Saturday night (x6)
She sat there all alone with a Shirley Temple and a cellular phone
No one to call, no one to ring
'Cause no one's home
The bartender knew her number and name
I grabbed my cell phone and gave her a ring
Wrong number
I guess I gotta do it the hard way
I walked up to her having seen the future and said
I'm sorry sorry for making your life a living hell (x2)
But that wasn't me
That was alter ego
Yes, that wasn't me
That was Johnny Rockets
She was so confused
From her point of view
I would be confused too
I'm so rude
What was I thinking?
But, but
She dug my hair and new suede shoes
So much she dragged me straight, straight to her room
And I was forgetting what I knew I would do
Two hours later we lay on the bed and I said
I'm sorry sorry for making your life a living hell
Yes I'm, I'm sorry sorry for making your life a living hell
That wasn't me
That was alter ego
That wasn't me
That was Johnny Rockets
Take it away
I'm sorry sorry for making your life a living hell
I'm sorry (x4)
I'm sorry sorry for making your life a living hell
I'm sorry (x3)
WOOO!
I'm sorry sorry for making your life (x2)
I'm sorry sorry for making your life a living hellEmbed
