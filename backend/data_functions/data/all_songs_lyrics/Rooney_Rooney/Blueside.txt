Blueside LyricsThe colors have built up in my mind
They're bleeding through my heart
But nobody knows that they exist
Look at my bursting veins
Now do you see the red in me
It's a sign for the end
Only the ends of the red
Will show you my blueside
Only the ends of the red
Will show you my blueside
I've been given my brush and plate
Where will I paint my life
And will the buyer in the sky
Believe in what I dream
And it's so hard for me to explain
What I will miss to myself
Only the ends of the red
Will show you my blueside
Only the ends of the red
Only the ends of the red
Will show you my blueside
Only the ends of the red
Will show you my blueside
Only the ends of the red
Will show you my blueside
Only the ends of the red
Will show you my bluesideEmbed
