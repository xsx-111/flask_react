The Floor LyricsWell, I don't want you
When you want me
And I don't need you
Like I need dough
See those flowers?
They were on sale
And all that foreplay
It was for me
I never loved you
When you loved me
I never cared about you
When you cared about me
I've got
The F-L-double-O-R (x3)
I've got the floor
Hey, pretty lady
Not you, behind you
Where'd you get that
Amazing booty?
Oh, tae-bo works
See, tae-bo works
Thanks for the info
Here's my number
I never loved you
When you loved me
I never cared about you
When you cared about me
I've got
The F-L-double-O-R (x3)
I've got the floor
I don't want you
When you want me
And I don't need you
Like you need me
I don't want you
When you want me
And I don't need you
Like you need me
I never loved you
When you loved me
I never cared about you
When you cared about me
(x2)
About me
I've got
The F-L-double-O-R (x3)
I've got the floor
I don't want you1Embed
