Stay Away LyricsStay away from my friends
They're smooth operators
Looking for a way in
Stay away from me tonight
I've made other plans
And you'll just be distracting me
In a good way
She doesn't know
That I love her
Yes, I love her
Make a move on me, baby
I can't be the one who's
Always taking chances
See me down
So, you get down
No, you've got me all wrong
I just want to kiss your lips
And you kiss back
She doesn't know
That I love her
Yes, I love her
She doesn't know
That I love her
Leave us alone (x3)
Your friends
And my friends
Leave us alone
Your friends
And my friends
Should go
Far away
She doesn't know
That I love her
Yes, I love her
