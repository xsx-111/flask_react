Ku-U-I-Po Lyrics
Ku‘u ipo I love you more today
More today than yesterday
But I love you less today
Less than I will tomorrow

See the sweet Hawaiian rose
See it blossom, see it grow
That's the story of our love
Ever since we said hello

Ku‘u ipo I love you more today
More today than yesterday
But I love you less today
Less than I will tomorrow

As the years go passing by
We'll recall our wedding day
I will be there by your side
You will always hear me say

Ku‘u ipo I love you more today
More today than yesterday
But I love you less today
Less than I will tomorrow
Ku‘u ipo,ku‘u ipo,  you're my Hawaiian sweetheart
Ku‘u ipo,ku‘u ipo,  you're my Hawaiian sweetheartEmbed
