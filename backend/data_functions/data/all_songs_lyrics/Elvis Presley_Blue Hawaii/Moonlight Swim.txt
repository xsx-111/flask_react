Moonlight Swim Lyrics
Let's go on a moonlight swim
Far away from the crowd
All alone upon the beach
Our lips and our arms
Close within each other's reach
We'll be (yes, we'll be)
On a moonlight swim (on a moonlight swim)

Let's go on a moonlight swim
To the raft we can race
After just a little while
I'll sit and pretend
That you're on a desert isle
With me on a moonlight swim (on a moonlight swim)

Though the air is cold
With kisses, oh, so sweet (so sweet)
I'll keep you warm
So very warm from head to your feet

Now let's go on a moonlight swim
We're in love and above
There's a crazy gold balloon
That sits winking down
And inviting us to come on in (come on in)
On a moonlight swim
(Oh, though the air is cold)
(With kisses, oh, so sweet)
I'll keep you warm
So very warm from head to your feet

Let's go on a moonlight swim
We're in love and above
There's a crazy gold balloon
That sits winking down
And inviting us to come on in (come on in)
On a moonlight swim
On a moonlight swim
On a moonlight swim
On a moonlight swimEmbed
