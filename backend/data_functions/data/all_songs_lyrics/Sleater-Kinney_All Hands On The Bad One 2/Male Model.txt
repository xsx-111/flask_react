Male Model Lyrics
He's got a perfect face
(Turn away before you go and turn me on)
I cannot look away
(I'm stunned
It's that Je ne sais quoi, uh huh)
He talks to me in my sleep
Does he write my songs for me?

Should I try to play just like him?
(Kick it out, could you show me your riffs?)
You always measure me by him
(Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to something big)
I'm so sick of tests
Go ahead and flunk my ass

You don't own the situation, honey
You don't own the stage
We're here to join the conversation
And we're here to raise the stakes
Now do you hear that sound?
As the model breaks
Take the stage!
Let the image of him fade away
(Go back and tear the pictures from the page)
It's time for a new rock n' roll age
(History will have to find a different face)
And if you're ready for more
I just might be what you're looking for

You don't own the situation, honey
You don't own the stage
We're here to join the conversation
And we're here to raise the stakes
Now do you hear that sound?
As the model breaks
Take the stage!Embed
