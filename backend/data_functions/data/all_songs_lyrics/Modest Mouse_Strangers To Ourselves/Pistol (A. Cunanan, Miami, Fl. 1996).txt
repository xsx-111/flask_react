Pistol (A. Cunanan, Miami, Fl. 1996) Lyrics
I've got my pistol in the car, uh-huh
I got my stereo in the car, uh-huh
I've got my room key in the car, uh-huh
Why don't you come to my room and clean my pistol, no duh?
I maximize my own liaisons
I'm going to take it 'til the taking comes on

I've got my cocaine in the glove box now
The sun roof is down, oh wow
I've got my room key in my pocket, and you know
I've got a pistol that I need to unload
I'm going to t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-take you on up, you say "what?"
I'm going to t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-take your shirt right on off
I'm going to zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip your pants on down
I'm going to sip-sip-sip-sip-sip from my Royal, Royal, Royal Crown

And we go woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
And we go woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo

I got a backpack with some clothes that I could wear to work tomorrow, they won't know-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
That I was up all night not ready for the meeting, oh no! Oh-oh
Got a wallet in my backpack, and I think it's mine, but I don't care, you know, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Got my backpack with the money got myself a passport, I should probably go
And we go woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
And we go woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
