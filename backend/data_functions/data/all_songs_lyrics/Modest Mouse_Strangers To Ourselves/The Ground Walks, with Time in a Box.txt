The Ground Walks, with Time in a Box Lyrics
Open up a window
All the air, oh, the air it's falling out
Eyes vacuum up light
Sound gets trapped by the mouth
We'll deal with the remainder
When the dents, the dents get hammered out
Then we'll travel through time

The world's an inventor
With its work crawlin', runnin', squirmin' 'round
Trees drop colorful fruits
Directly into our mouths
The world's an inventor
We're the dirtiest thing it's thought about
And we really don't mind

We'll probably never get there
Bring your sightseer school teachers down
It's a watercolor weekend
All the trees are turning colors now
We'll probably never get there
Bring your candy taster, time wasters around
And we'll fuck with their minds
The world composes
With his shirttails wrinkled, hanging out
Bang us together
See what sort of sounds we make right now
The world plays music
Playing skin on teeth inside of a mouth
What sort of sounds?
What lovely sounds come about?

We greased all the ropes
The part of the ground
We'll throw you a line
That's above the ground
We're gonna break these boulders
We're the part of the ground
We're gonna pull things out
That when things come together
We greased all the ropes
Come bubbling outwards
We'll throw you a line
And then sink back
We're gonna break these boulders
Come bubbling outwards
We're gonna travel time
When things come together
We're gonna throw a party
All the ghosts of trees are coming out
Don't move in any direction
Wait until the light's inside of the clouds
You're gonna wanna see this
Don't bring your camera around
Watch sun and sawdust align

We greased all the ropes
Come bubbling outwards
We'll throw you a line
Then sinking back
We're gonna break these boulders
The part of the ground
We're gonna pull things out
When things come together
We greased all the ropes
Come bubbling outwards
We'll throw you a line
We're gonna break these boulders
We're gonna travel time

Close up a window
All the air, all the air is falling out
Eyes vacuum up light
Sound gets trapped by the mouth
Our predecessor left this box
And something's clawing around
I think it really wants out17Embed
