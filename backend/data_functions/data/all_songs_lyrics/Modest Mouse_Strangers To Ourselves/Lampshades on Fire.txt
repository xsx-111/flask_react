Lampshades on Fire Lyrics
(Up-up-up-up up-up ba-da-dah
Duh-duh-duh-duh duh-duh da-da-dah)
We're all going, we're all going

Well, the lampshade's on fire and the lights go out
The room lit up and we ran about
Well, this is what I'd really call a party now
Packed up our cars, moved to the next town
Well, the lampshade's on fire and the lights go out
This is what I'd really call a party now
Well, fear makes us really, really run around
This one's done so where to now?
Our eyes light up, we have no shame at all
Well, you all know what I'm talking about
Shaved off my eyebrows, let 'em fall to the ground
So I can't look surprised right now
Pack up again, head to the next place
Where we'll make the same mistakes
Burn it up or just chop it down
This one's done so where to now?

(Up-up-up-up up-up ba-da-dah
Duh-duh-duh-duh duh-duh da-da-dah)
We're all going, we're all going
Well, the lampshade's on fire when the lights go out
This is what I really call a party now
Well, fear makes us really, really run around
Ah, this one's done so where to now?
Our eyes light up, we have no shame at all
Well, you all know what I'm talking about
The room lights up, well, we're still dancing around
We're having fun, having some fun now
Pack up again, head to the next place
Where we'll make the same mistakes
Open one up and let it fall to the ground
Pile out the door when it all runs out

(Up-up-up-up up-up ba-da-dah
Duh-duh-duh-duh duh-duh da-da-dah)
We're all going, we're all going

We have spines and other bones
We'll eat your food, we'll throw stones
Oh, this is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go
Well, we're the human race
We're going to party out this place
And then move on
(Tough luck)
We'll kill you off and then make a clone
Yeah, we got spines and we have bones!
This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go
Our soft feelings are getting hurt
Oh, we want you to do the work
Our ass looks great inside these jeans
Well, we want just our water clean
This is how it's always been
And this is how it's going to be
So, you just move on
(Yow!)
The air's on fire so we're moving on
Better find another one 'cause this one's done
Waiting for the magic of the scientist's glove
To push, push, push, push, pull us up
Spend some time to floating out in space
Find another planet, make the same mistakes
Our minds all shatter when we climb on board
Hoping for the scientists to find another door
