Pups to Dust Lyrics
Our hearts don't change from pups to dust
Couldn't see clearly, but I had a sense of what right and wrong was
Honest to God, I was honest as hell
I don't lie very often but I lie very well
Give it away, take what you need
Love does not cost money, but it ain't free

We're learning slowly
Equal parts of what you do, you don't
We don't remember
We don't remember just how we got here
Equal parts of what we do, we don't
We don't belong here
We were just born here

We remain the same (I'm not sure about that)
Or pretty much the same (Now that's more like it)
From birth to grave, I couldn't see so clearly what I was or became
Oh, I missed a spot (Scrubba scrubba scrubba scrubba)
On my dirty thoughts
The way we feel about what we do is by who has watched us, so...

Aw, how'd we get here?
Equal parts of what we do, we don't
We don't remember
We were just born here though
Oh, what's the bother?
Equal parts of what you do, you don't
We don't remember
We were just born here
We don't belong here
We were just born here
I feel so anxious mostly all of the time
If there's some point to this then which one is mine?

We really don't belong here, we really ought to wander
We really don't belong here, we really ought to wander
We really don't belong here, we really ought to wander away3Embed
