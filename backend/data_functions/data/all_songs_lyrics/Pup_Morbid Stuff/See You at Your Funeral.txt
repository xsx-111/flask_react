See You at Your Funeral Lyrics
The days blur into one and I float around the edge of them
Searching for something that'll make me feel alive again
These past few weeks in a hell of my own creation
I try vegan food, I take up meditation

I hope you're doing fine on your own
'Cause after everything we've been through
You better hope you'll find someone
And you'll try, but you won't
'Cause after everything we've been through
Oh, baby, I wanna know

What you were thinking when you saw me in the produce section
Buying organic foods, making healthy selections
I asked you how you've been, not that it's any of my business
But you know me; I've always been a little masochistic

I hope you're doing fine on your own
'Cause after everything we've been through
You better hope you'll find someone
And you'll try, but you won't
'Cause after everything we've been through
Oh, baby, I wanna know

I hope somehow I never see you again
And if I do, it's at your funeral, or better yet
I hope the world explodes, I hope that we all die
We can watch the highlights in hell, I hope they're televised

I hope you're doing fine on your own
'Cause after everything we've been through
You better hope you'll find someone
And you'll try, but you won't
'Cause after everything we've been through
Oh, baby, I wanna know
