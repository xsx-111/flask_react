City Lyrics
I was on the outside
I was looking in like a deer in the headlights
Stuck in slow motion like I was on the turnpike
No ability to steer
Can't shake the feeling I'm starting to disappear

I'm weighed down in this city
It's hard to live here
And I've been feeling restless
There's this battle raging in me
Don't want to love you anymore
But I can't help it

I was on the outside
Like we were at the cinema
Your face was hidden
Behind the camera
I think I love you
More than I'd admit
And I was not prepared
To be seeing you like this

And I'm weighed down in this city
It's hard to live here
And I've been feeling restless
There's this battle raging in me
Don't want to love you anymore
But I can't help it
And between you and me
This city's been slowly poisoning me
And as I rip deeper into its scales
It rots beneath my fingernails
And when I try to claw out of the pit
All I do is get sucked back in
Don't want to love you anymore
But I just can't help it

And I'm weighed down in this city
And I've been feeling restless
There's this battle raging in me
Don't want to love you anymore
But I can't help it

And I'm weighed down in this city
Don't want to love you anymoreEmbed
