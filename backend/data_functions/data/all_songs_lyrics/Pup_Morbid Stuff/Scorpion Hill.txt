Scorpion Hill Lyrics
Up on Scorpion Hill, watching life
Passing me by in the pale moonlight
And I sat there forever, three sheets to the wind
It's not helping my case, the state that I'm in, but
It's not how they told you
My intentions were good
I was just bursting apart like the end of the ark
Holding on to whatever I could

A square of light moves its way through the empty room
Across the stained yellow carpet
Like a ghost of myself in the afternoon
Haunting my basement apartment, I
Looked into the mirror hanging behind my door
The glass was cracked and the man staring back, he don't look like me anymore
And if the world is gonna burn, everyone should get a turn to light it up

Down and out, I've been on the rocks
I've been having some pretty dark thoughts
I like them a lot, woo!

Time and time again, well I've tried and failed
To get my act together
And I'll admit lately things really went off the rails
I know that you deserve better
Then in the morning, as I was boarding the
Commuter train to work
The boss was calling, he said, "There's been cutbacks and I'm
Sorry you're the first"
And if I can't support the two of us, how can I support a third?
Down and out, I've been on the rocks
I've been having some pretty dark thoughts
And I'm on the brink, falling deep into debt
Falling deep into drink, I can drown those regrets
I don't have to think...

Now I'm working the night shift
Asleep at the wheel
I was bursting apart like a flame from a spark
Thinking, "Jesus, this can't be for real"

My sweat-soaked mattress, corner of the room
Cigarettes and matches in the fading afternoon
And a picture of my kid, yeah, he's smiling
It's the first day of school

She said, "I found the gun, it was buried beneath
Piles of clothes in the room where your son sleeps
And I can't pretend, to know how this will end"Embed
