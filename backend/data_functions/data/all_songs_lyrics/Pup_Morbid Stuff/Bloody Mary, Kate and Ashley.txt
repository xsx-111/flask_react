Bloody Mary, Kate and Ashley Lyrics
It's only a game
I hadn’t thought about it in years
Repeated her name
Three times into the mirror
The candles went out
And you started to laugh
Well, I heard a sound in the attic
But you don't believe in all of that

Are you real or fake?
Are you alive? Am I awake?
This must be some kinda mistake
A trick of the eyes or the drugs that I'm taking

Walked through the door
With some gasoline in a can
Put some on the floor
In the shape of a pentagram
And I lit a match
As we stood in a circle
Flames shooting up to the sky
Like some vision of hell, Satan send me a signal
There’s blood in the sink
There's blood on the windows
I need a drink
I need to, I need to, I need to know
Are you real or fake?
Are you alive? Am I awake?
This must be some kinda mistake
A trick of the eyes or the drugs that I'm taking
Are you real or fake?
Do you prefer Ashley or Mary Kate?
And who let you outta your grave?
Can anyone see this or am I just tripping?


Are you real or fake?
Are you alive? Am I awake?
This must be some kinda mistake
A trick of the eyes or the drugs that I'm taking
Are you real or fake?
Do you prefer Ashley or Mary Kate?
And who let you outta your grave?
Can anyone see this or am I just tripping?3Embed
