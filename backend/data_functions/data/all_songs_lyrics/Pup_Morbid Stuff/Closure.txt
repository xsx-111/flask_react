Closure Lyrics
The light was starting to fade
And I could feel the reaper
Waiting in the tall grass
Feeding off the fever

And I couldn't figure out why
You were down in the cold dirt
Something doesn’t feel right

I need closure
I need closure

With you not around
It was starting to set in
Howled 'til my voice
Was totally shredded
Where do you get off
Thinking that you could just cut me off
When I thought that we were connecting?

And each night, I have the same dream
I'm face to face with your other
There’s a part of you that's still a part of me
I need closure
I need closure
Yeah, I was looking for something
To keep these scabs from coming off
I need closure

I don't need you to feel fine
I don't need you to come back
But I don't think I'll ever feel right
'Cause I need something I can't have

I need closure
I need closure
Yeah, I was looking for something
To keep these scabs from coming off
I need closure
