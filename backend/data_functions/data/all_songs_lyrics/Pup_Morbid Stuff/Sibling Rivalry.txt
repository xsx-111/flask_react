Sibling Rivalry Lyrics

This raft is hard to steer
The water is low this time of year
The smell of old decay
Is seeping into my sweater
And all the run-off shit
From the nearby development
Is soaking through my shoes
I'm barely keeping it together, like

I'm not trying to stick it to you
But I've been trying hard
Getting through to you
And I'm not gonna lie, let's face it
You know I won't take it
I'm never gonna take it

And you didn't even notice
Just running through the motions
Don't test my patience
And I just can't take it no more
Holy shit! It's coming down
Three feet of snow, the frozen ground
Stuck in the tent for days
And you started laughin'
You said that it's a sign
Let's get high out of our minds
And throw away the map
Just to see what would happen

I'm not trying to stick it to you
But who thought of this in the first place?
And I've been trying to get through to you 'cause
You're losing it in the worst way

You always got me on the hook
And you didn't even notice
Back in the old neighborhood
Just running through the motions
You know just how to piss me off
Don't test my patience
You're always up to no good
And I just can't take it
Even when I know I should
Don't know what to do
'Cause I'd still want to hang with you
Whenever I could
I'm not tryin' to stick it to you
But I've been trying to get through to you

And you didn't even notice
Just running through the motions
Don't test my patience
'Cause I just can't take it

You've always got me on the hook
And I just can't take it
Back in the old neighborhood
Yeah, I just can't take it
You know just how to piss me off
Don't test my patience
You're always up to no good
And I just can't take it
Even when I know I should1Embed
