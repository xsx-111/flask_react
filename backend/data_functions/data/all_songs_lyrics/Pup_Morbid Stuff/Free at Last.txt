Free at Last Lyrics
I was kissing your salty lips
Wet from your nose as it started to drip, it was
Twenty below and you were shaking
I was a compass without a map, I was
A drifter on the side of the tracks, I was
Free at last, thought I could escape it

But I can't and I won't, she keeps saying

Just 'cause you're sad again
It doesn't make you special at all
Just 'cause you're sad again
It doesn't make you special

Motivation, it comes and goes
Keepin' expectations low
So when I let you down
I won't feel so bad
Sloppy Steffy back at it again
Calling you up at 5 AM
"Have you been drinking?"
Well of course I have
And why the hell would I be here if I wasn't?

Just 'cause you're sad again
It doesn't make you special at all
Just 'cause you're sad again
It doesn't make you special
I'm waking up again
Knowing nothing really matters at all
Just 'cause you're sad again
It doesn't make you special

Woo!


Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh...

Just 'cause you're sad again
It doesn't make you special at all
Just 'cause you're sad again
It doesn't make you special
I'm waking up again
Knowing nothing really matters at all
Just 'cause you're sad again
It doesn't make you special1Embed
