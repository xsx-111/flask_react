Bare Hands Lyrics
Cut me loose in mid-September
I was out of my element
Started building up these walls
Keeping everybody outside of them
Bare hands holding on to the wire

Weeks pass, the Earth is turning
Things start swimming into focus
And now I'm rolling your words through my cheeks
Like a mouth full of poison
I watch it all go up in a fire

(Ah) You were feeling lonely, and you called me
Hoping I'd be home
(Ah) You're like a bad trip or a sick habit
I should've left it alone
You were feeling lonely, takin' advantage
Knowing I wouldn't say no (No)
You're just a bad trip, I can't help it, oh-oh-oh-oh

Wake up alone, now it's December
There's snow out in the yard
A cold wind cutting through my jacket
As I drift up the boulevard
That sinking feeling creeping in again
No matter what I try
And I'm just waiting for a signal
I'm just staring down at my
Bare hands holding on to the wire
Good lord, I'm worn out, and I'm always tired
Bare hands holding on to the wire
And I'm always tired
(Ah) You were feeling lonely, and you called me
Hoping I'd be home
(Ah) You're like a bad trip or a sick habit
I should've left it alone
You were feeling lonely, takin' advantage
Knowing I wouldn't say no (No)
You're just a bad trip, I can't help it

(Ah) You were feeling lonely
(Ah) And you called me
(Ah) Takin' advantage
(Ah) You're just a bad trip, I can't help it, oh-oh-oh-oh

Bare hands holding on to the wire
Bare hands holding on to the wire
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah...1Embed
