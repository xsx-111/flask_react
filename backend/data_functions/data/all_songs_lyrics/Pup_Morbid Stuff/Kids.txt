Kids Lyrics
Just like the kids, I've been navigating my way
Through the mind-numbing reality of a Godless existence
Which, at this point in my hollow and vapid life
Has erased what little ambition I've got left
And I've embraced the calamity
With a detachment and a passive disinterest
Livin' out the back of my '97 Camry
Wonderin' how the hell I got myself into this

I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I don't care about nothin' but you
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause I don't care about nothin'
I don't care about nothin' but you
No, I don't care about nothin'

She said, "I'm sick of it all
Your little games are getting old
Your little songs are getting way too literal
How about some goddamn subtlety for a change?"
She said, "I feel like I've come untethered
In a room without walls
I'm drifting on a dark and empty sea of nothin'
It doesn't feel bad, it feels like nothin' at all"
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I don't care about nothin' but you
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause I don't care about nothin'

And I had it maxed out
I had a feeling, oh
Nothing is working
And everything's bleeding, oh
I should've tapped out
Given into my demons, oh

It's alright, it's just a flesh wound
You said you never saw it coming
I'm pretty happy lying here with you
It's pretty good to feel something

I don't care about nothin' but you
No, I don't care about nothin'
I don't care about nothin' but you
No, I don't care about nothin'
And I had it maxed out
I had a feeling, oh
Nothing is working
And everything's bleeding, oh
I should've tapped out
Given into my demons, oh
I had it maxed out (I had it maxed out)
And nothing is working (Nothing is working)
And everything's bleeding, oh3Embed
