Peacocks LyricsI hear them squeal, I see them preen
Fans all spread out, neat and clean
Grab hold of the morning, head out to the porch
Feel the wind stopping, feel the sun scorch
I fear for my safety, you can see it in my eyes
In an hour or two, we will rise
Then a sharp breeze kicks up
I hug myself hard
How come there's peacocks in the front yard?
Sun's all prickly on my neck
When the helicopter passes, we both hit the deck
Hands grasping and groping
Seizing opportunity right where it lies
The sky will fall, we will riseEmbed
