Idylls of the King LyricsThis place, with its old plantations
These roads, leading out to the sea
This day, full of promise and potential
More clay pigeons for you and me
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them, all lined up
Huge crows loitering by the curb
Our shared paths unraveling behind us like ribbons
And I dreamed of vultures in the trees around our house
Cicadas and locusts, and the shrieking of innumerable gibbons
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them, all lined up
How long will we ride this wave out?
How long till someone caves under the pressure?
My dreams are haunted by armies, armies of ghosts
Faces too blurry to make out
Numbers far too high to measure
Your face like a vision straight out of Holly Hobbie
Late light drizzling through your hair
Your eyes, twin volcanoes
Bad ideas dancing around in there
All all of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them, all lined upEmbed
