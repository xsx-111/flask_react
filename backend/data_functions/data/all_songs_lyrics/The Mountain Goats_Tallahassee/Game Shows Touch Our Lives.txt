Game Shows Touch Our Lives LyricsDug up a fifth of Hood River gin
That stuff tastes like medicine
But I'll take it, it'll do
On the couch in the living room all day long
Music on the television playing our song
I'm in the mood
The mood for you
Turn the volume up real high
All of that money, look at it fly
And you smoking like a chimney
Shadows crawled across the living room's length
I held on to you with a desperate strength
With everything, with everything in me
And I handed you a drink of the lovely little thing
On which our survival depends
People say friends don't destroy one another
What do they know about friends?
Thunder clouds forming, cream white moon
Everything's gonna be okay soon
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day
Carried you up the stairs that night
All this could be yours if the price is right
I heard cars headed down to oblivion up on the expressway
Your drunken kiss is as light as the air
Maybe everything that falls down eventually rises
Our house sinking into disrepair
Ah, but look at this showroom, filled with fabulous prizesEmbed
