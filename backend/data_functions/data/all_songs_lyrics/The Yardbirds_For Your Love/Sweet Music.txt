Sweet Music Lyrics
Sweet music, sweet music
Why do my heart skips a beat?
Pretty music
What makes the soul come out of me?
Pretty music
Somebody's really gotta tell me
Pretty music
What makes this music sound so sweet?
Pretty music
Sweet music, sweet music
What puts the rhythm on in my feet?
Pretty music
They start to tap with every beat
Pretty music
Well, it's a strange, strange feeling but it's real
Pretty music
It gives me such a magic thrill
Pretty music
Sweet music

Could it be the beat of the drums?
Could it be the harp that charms?
The wailing guitars are so great
They really put the rhythm of today
I've gotta really, really know why
Pretty music
Some of the music brings tears to my eyes
Pretty music
Emotion really starts to scream in my soul
Pretty music
Like love so new, just won't grow old
Pretty music
Sweet music

Could it be the beat of the drums?
Could it be the harp that charms?
The wailing guitars are so great
They really put the rhythm of today

I've gotta really, really know why
Pretty music
Some of the music brings tears to my eyes
Pretty music
Emotion really starts to scream in my soul
Pretty music
Like love so new, just won't grow old
Pretty music
Sweet music
Sweet music
Sweet music
Sweet music
Sweet music
Sweet musicEmbed
