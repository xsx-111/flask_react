I Wish You Would Lyrics
Early in the morning, 'bout the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby, I wish you would
Try and love me, you won't do no good

Walking and a-kissing late at night
I tell you now baby, I feel just right
Come now baby, whatcha trying to do?
Trying to love me and some other man too
Come now baby, give me one more chance
You know I still love you, want to give you romance
Yeah, give you romance, all night long
In my arms, woah, yeah

Early in the morning, 'bout the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby, I wish you would
Try and love me, you won't do no good

You know baby, that I love you so
You know pretty baby, it hurts me to see you go
Oh yeah, oh yeahEmbed
