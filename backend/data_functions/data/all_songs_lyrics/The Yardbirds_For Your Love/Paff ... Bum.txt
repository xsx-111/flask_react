Paff ... Bum Lyrics(G. Reverbel / Bardotti / Paul Samwell-Smith)
Paff... bum
Thats the sound of love
Paff... bum
That's the way love goes
Paff... bum
Well, I met you yesterday, yeah
Paff... bum
And now you've gone away
Pretty girls are everywhere
Now you've gone
I just don't care
There will be
Another waiting there
Paff... bum
Thats the sound of love
Paff... bum
Well, that's the way love goes
Pretty girls are everywhere
Now you've gone
I just don't care
There will be
Another waiting there
Paff... bum
There'll be more tomorrow, yeah
Paff... bum
Well, that's the way love goes
Paff... bum
Paff... bum
Paff... bum
Paff... bum
Paff... bumEmbed
