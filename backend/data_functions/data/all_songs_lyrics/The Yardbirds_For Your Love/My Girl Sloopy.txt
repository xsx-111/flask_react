My Girl Sloopy Lyrics
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on

Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town
All the little girls there are trying to put poor Sloopy down
Sloopy, I don't care what your Daddy do
You know, little girl, I'm in love with you
All together now


Sloopy lets her hair down
Every time she's out on the town
(Hang on Sloopy)
Sloopy lets her hair down
Every time she's out with me
(Hang on Sloopy)
Come on, Sloopy
(Come on, come on)
Come on, girl
(Come on, come on)
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Good, good, good, good
(Good, good, good, good)
Good, good, good, good
(Good, good, good, good)
I wanna say ah, ah, ah
(Hang on, Sloopy)
Baby, don't you know, you thrill me so
I love you so, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Love the way that you dance
Give me one chance and I'll sweep you away
I wanna say ah, ah, ah
Hang on, Sloopy
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on
All together now
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on
A little bit quieter
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on
All down
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on
Whisper it
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on
Very, very quiet
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on
Yeah, now come on, Sloopy
(Come on, come on)
Yeah, now come on, girl
(Come on, come on)
Come away with it, Sloopy
Come away with it, little girl
Love the way you walk
Love the way you talk, baby
Oh, oh, oh
I got something more to say to you
Little Sloopy blue
I wanna say ah, ah, ah
Hang on, SloopyEmbed
