Kiss Me Like You Mean It Lyrics
He is my Lord, he is my savior
And he rewards my good behavior
My secret soul, I know he's seen it

He says, "Come here baby and
Kiss me like you mean it"
He calls me baby
Says, "Kiss me like you mean it"

He is my light and my salvation
He's always right, he's always patient
I pinch myself, it's like I'm dreaming it

He says, "Come here baby and
Kiss me like you mean it"
He calls me baby
Says, "Kiss me like you mean it"


He is my love, he's always been it
He says, "Come here baby and
Kiss me like you mean it"
He calls me baby
Says, "Kiss me like you mean it"Embed
