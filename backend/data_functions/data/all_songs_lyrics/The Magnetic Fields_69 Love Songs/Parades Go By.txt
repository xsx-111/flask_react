Parades Go By Lyrics
I'll linger here
Your ring upon my finger dear
And sing till dawn
A song of you and me and what and why
For time is all
I have to keep between these walls
And half asleep

The days go by
A million little nights and days go by
And I don't mind
Parades go by
So many beautiful parades go by
Leave me behind

I'll sit and stare
How could I venture anywhere
And let the centuries
Fall where they may but never die
For I have loved
And so I lost the world above
Beyond the moss
The days go by
A million little nights and days go by
And I don't mind
Parades go by
So many beautiful parades go by
Leave me behind
The days go by
A million little nights and days go by
And I don't mind
Parades go by
So many beautiful parades go by
Leave me behindEmbed
