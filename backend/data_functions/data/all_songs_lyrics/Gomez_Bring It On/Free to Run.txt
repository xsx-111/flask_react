Free to Run LyricsI'm free to run, I walk slowly along
Like everyone, walking slowly along
I walk slowly along
I been walking far too long
Dragged my feet like everyone
Always wanted to run away
But walked slowly along
My feet, so tired
Come sit here for a while
I can see it in your smile
Come sit here, let's hope for a while
I've been walking far too long
Dragged my feet like everyone
Always wanted to run away
But walked slowly along
I walked slowly along
Walked slowly
I'm free to run
I'm free to run
I'm free to run
I'm free to run
I'm free to run
I'm free to runEmbed
