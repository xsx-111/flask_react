Tijuana Lady LyricsTake me down to where you hide
Lay me down, lay me down inside
What use now
Roll back this pacific tide
Tijuana lady, where did you go
Yeah, I been chasing you around all Mejico
I'm gonna find my way back to San Diego
Baby, where'd you hide
Take me down to where you hide
Play me around, lay me at your side
Don't delay your smile, 'cause I know you lie
Tijuana lady, let's take it slow
Yeah, well I, I know that I'm no head honcho
Yeah, but I'll, I'll keep you warm in my silky poncho
Where'd you hide?
Where'd you hide?
Tijuana lady, where did you go?
Yeah, well I, I heard you lost your last sombrero
Tijuana lady, which way'd you flow?
El mariachi, desperado
Where'd you hide?
Tell me, where'd you hide?
Enchilada, desperado day
Senorita, come back and meet me again
Upon the vista, senorita, hey
I love you, so come back here with me againEmbed
