Get Myself Arrested LyricsI wear the same shoes as everyone
I got the same blues as everyone
So try and call me, I'm immobile man
Yes I am
Got a haircut, got a silver tooth
Gonna get myself arrested
Got some friends in my BMW
Tryin'a get themselves arrested
I suck the same lines as anyone
I do the same time as anyone
Don't try and call me, I'm immobile man
Yes I am
Got a haircut, got a silver tooth
Gonna get myself arrested
Got some friends in my BMW
Tryin'a get themselves arrested
He only grows for guys he knows and me
He only grows for guys he knows and me
Well, alright
Don't try and call me, I'm immobile man
Don't try and call me, I'm immobile man
Yes I am
Got a haircut, got a silver tooth
Gonna get myself arrested
Got some friends in my BMW
Tryin'a get themselves arrested
Got no time for the selfish me and you's
Tryin'a get myself arrestedEmbed
