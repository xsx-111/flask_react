Get Miles LyricsI love this island, but this island's killing me
Sitting here in silence, man, I don't get no peace
The waves upon my shore take me away piece by piece
Gonna leave everything I know
Gonna head out towards the sea
Jump off this island
Gonna head out towards the sea
I love this city, man, but this city's killing me
Sitting here in all this noise, man, I don't get no peace
The cars below my street take me away piece by piece
Gonna leave everything I know
Gonna head out towards the sea
Gonna leave this city, man
Gonna head out towards the sea
Get miles away
Get miles away
Get miles away
Get miles
I love this planet, but this planet's killing me
Sitting here in all this grass, man, I don't get no weed
The sweat coming from my palms takes me away piece by piece
Gonna leave everything I know
Gonna head to the galaxy
Gonna leave this planet, man
Gonna head to the galaxy
Get miles away
Get miles away
Get miles away
Get miles away
Get miles away
Get miles away
Get miles away
Get milesEmbed
