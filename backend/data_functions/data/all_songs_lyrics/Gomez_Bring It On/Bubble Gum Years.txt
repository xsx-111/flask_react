Bubble Gum Years LyricsLost souls, you and I, my dear
Whiskey bottle and a .45, my dear
We're on a roll, suitcase and cellophane, my dear
Whiskey bottle and a .45 satisfies, my dear
And someone's whispering into my ear
Asking softly, "What do you fear today?"
'Cause in faithless times
I know your hate
I seen your crimes
I felt your cruelty
In the bubble gum years
In the bubble gum years
Wastin' time, lost my money
Found someone who'll call me honey
How we go was never clear
Go look for something much less sincere
My dear
Whiskey bottle and a .45 satisfies, my dear
And someone's whispering into my ear
Asking softly, "What do you fear today?"
'Cause in faithless times
I know your hate
I felt your crimes
I felt your cruelty
In the bubble gum years
In the bubble gum years
In the bubble gum yearsEmbed
