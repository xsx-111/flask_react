78 Stone Wobble LyricsI was always told that you had to have the balls to break down;
Now I'm older, I'm not too sure
I was once told that you had to have a high to lowdown;
An expert told me back in the war
Open-hearted surgery never works
So eat your words or hide 'em in the dirt
Cause I don't need nobody to know me
I don't want nobody to know
I was always told that you had to have the balls to break down;
Now I'm older, I'm not too sure
I was once told that you had to have a high to lowdown;
An expert told me back in the war
Open-hearted surgery never works
So eat your words or hide 'em in the dirt
Cause I don't want nobody to know me
I don't need nobody to know
Open-hearted surgery never works
So eat your words or hide em in the dirt
Cause I don't need nobody to know me
I don't want nobody to know
I don't see nobody to show me, heyEmbed
