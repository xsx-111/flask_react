Love Is Better Than a Warm Trombone LyricsLove is better than a warm trombone when blown
Softer by a two tone brother
Down on luck by chance
Caress the head to find the boogaloo trance
With his hands in his pocket he could not lie
With his hands in his pocket he began to cry
With his hands in his pocket he lowered his eyes
He said, "Miss, I ought to apologise"
"I've been falling, I've fallen down"
The river of your love floors souls
Getting deeper than the deepest dishwashing bowl
Now brother, get the dirt off your hands
Getting darker than a sunchaser's suntan
Hands in his pocket he could not lie
Hands in his pocket he began to cry
Hands in his pocket he lowered his eyes
He said, "Miss, I ought to apologise"
"I've been falling, I've fallen down"
With his hands in his pocket he began to cry
With his hands in his pocket he could not lie
With his hands in his pocket he lowered his eyes
He said, "Miss, I ought to apologise"
"I've been falling, I've fallen down"Embed
