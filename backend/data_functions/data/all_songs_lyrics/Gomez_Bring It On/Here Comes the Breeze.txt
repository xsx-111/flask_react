Here Comes the Breeze LyricsHere comes the breeze, come on blow me up
Plantin' the seed, come on sew me up
Reelin', the feelin', making our way through the storm
We've been deceiving, making our way through the storm
All we need's a little water
Send a little message to ya
Gonna get out of here
Send a little message to ya
Gonna get out of here
Here comes the air, come on blow me up
Hottest affair, come on grow me up
Starin' at nothing, since I can't make out what it is
Searchin' for something, but I just don't know what it is
All we need's a little more to
Send a little message to ya
Gonna get out of here
Send a little message to ya
Gonna get out of here
Well come on in, come on in and lay me down now
And relax, cause the world will collapse with you
Turn your red light into blue
Why do you keep running around like that?
Sit back, cause this is gonna take a while
There's no shame in going out of style
Why do you keep running around like that?
Send a little message to ya
Gonna get out of here
Send a little message to ya
Gonna get out of here
Send a little message to ya
Gonna get out of here
Send a little message to ya
Gonna get out of hereEmbed
