Best Years of Our Lives LyricsMorning will break
When we awake
Oh, I'll thank you for asking
We are passing through
The best years of our lives
Different vices
Overrun me
When I'm down
And I can't get up
Is someone there to pick up the pieces?
We have our lives
And in our eyes
Nothing is wasted
For there's no time
To throw away another day
Finally running
We have the feeling
Nothing will change
Or try to tear us apart
Oh I need you, yes, I need you
I need you in the morning
Differеnt vices
They try to break mе
But when I'm up
I just can't get down
And there you are
You have picked up the pieces
Morning has broken
And as we awake
Oh I thank you for saying
Oh I need you, yes, I need you
In the best years of our livesEmbed
