Like a Child in Disguise LyricsThink that today
I'll go down by the sea
Think that today
It was made for me
Pack myself a lunch
And I will pack myself ahead
All today is Saturday
I'll spend Sunday in bed
And I'm so glad
That you've decided to come
You won't regret it
As we lunch in the sun
I'm the loser, but I know how to play the game
Couldn't she see that I'm a child in disguise
Experience makes the child grow wise
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
You give me rest and no complaints
Drawing little boxes
On pieces of paper
Looking out the window
On this rainy day
Head in hands
And with nothing to say
But, I'm the loser and I
Know how I played that game
And I think that I lost it
When all I wanted to do was touch you
I suppose you didn't
Think that much of me
Couldn't she see that I'm a
Child in disguise
Experience makes the
Child grow wise
Off to work tomorrow
Same old week
Still there's always Saturday
Saturday
Saturday makes the week
Saturday makes the week
Saturday makes the week
Saturday makes the week
Saturday makes the week
Saturday makes the weekEmbed
