Dancing Now LyricsWatch the doorman
As he rubs at his hands
Grimly stamps his feet
Looking down the street
Tables and bibles
Hookers line the wall
Whisky glasses
And darkness in the hall
Let me take you in my arms
And treat you like a child
Women and lovers
Reckless and wild
As you light the way ahead
With the beacon of your smile
Love is in reunion
Now I've understood your style
And we are changing
Feels so strange
To be dancing now
Slipping sideways
I can’t look down
Heart turns over
While we fool around
There's nothing new
Excеpt what has been forgotten
There's nothing nеw
Except what’s been forgotten
Curiously restless
We looked at the wall
Then at the ceiling
While out in the hall
There's nothing new
Except what's been forgotten
There's nothing new
Except what's been forgotten
Slipping sideways
I can't look down
Heart turns over
While we fool around
How could you
When I'm really shining
Rip this heart
In its silver lining
But I'm Fred Astaire
And I really don’t care
’Cause I'm dancing nowEmbed
