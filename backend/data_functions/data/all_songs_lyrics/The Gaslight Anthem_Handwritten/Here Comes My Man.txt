Here Comes My Man LyricsAnd how much time do you think that we have?
If I wanted to, I could start over again
Let the good night decide who she wants me to find
And I'll never let you drop another tear in my eye
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey here comes my man
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey here comes my man
Yeah
And all my life I never had a chance
Don't you think I knew about all your pretty girlfriends
But I waited for you, gave you time to decide
But you never saw it from anybody else's side
So I packed up my things and I faced up my doubts
You know I think I will grow my hair back out
Nevermind what you think
Nevermind what you like
I'll take it out to the streets for somebody else to admire
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey here comes my man
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey here comes my man
Maybe time will tell you
Why I got so much hell to sell you
Please, please understand me
Oh you can't just dance around me
Maybe your work will love you
When I'm just not there to hold you
Maybe your pride can be your companion
Oh but I just won't be there to stand for it
Not one more minute will I stand for it
Oh-oh
You found me singing, baby
Oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey here comes my man
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey here comes my man
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey here comes my man
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey here comes my man
Here comes my man
Here comes my man
Here comes my man
Here comes my man
Here comes my man1Embed
