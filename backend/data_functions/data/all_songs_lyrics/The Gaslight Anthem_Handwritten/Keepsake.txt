Keepsake LyricsIt's been 31 years since she's been in your arms
But don't worry about mama, mama's got a good heart
And I'm not looking for your love, I'm only sniffing out blood
Just a little taste of where I came from
And at the bottom of this river
Is where I put you down to lay so I can live with it
And in my heart, heart, heart, there are these waters
Where I put you down to lay while I learned to live with it
Until I'm free
And it's been all my life, I've been wondering on the inside
What we could have had here if you had a part in my life
And there were children involved and they were brothers to me
Even if we never got to meet
And at the bottom of this river
Is where I put you down to lay so I can live with it
And in my heart, heart, heart, there are these waters
Where I put you down to lay while I learned to live with it
Until I'm free at last from this shadow that hangs
Surely you wonder sometimes
But I'm sure you won't sympathize
Just what a man's to become
But just like his daddy has done
I just want to love someone who has the same blood, who has the same blood
And at the bottom of this river
Is where I put you down to lay so I can live with it
And in my hard, hard, heart, there are these waters
Where I put you down to lay while I learned to live with it
Keepsake, the keepsake
