Sliver LyricsMom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed
Said "Please, don't go"
Grandma take me home
Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good
Grandma take me home
Said "Why don't you stop your crying
Go outside and ride your bike? "
That's what I did
I killed my toe
Grandma take me home
After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched tv
I woke up in my mother's arms
Grandma take me home, never take me home 
Grandma take me home
I wanna be aloneEmbed
