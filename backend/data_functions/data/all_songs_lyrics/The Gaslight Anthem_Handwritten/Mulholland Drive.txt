Mulholland Drive LyricsDid you sleep last night and do you remember dreams?
Do I ever cross your mind and do you ever think of me?
When you think about your life are there things you would reverse?
I still remember holding you, just out of sight of her
In the deep, dark parking lot pressed up against my car
With your hands around my neck I felt the pounding of your heart
And the summer night was giving in to the lure of Autumn’s sway
I can’t seem to forget that night or how I heard you say

That I’d just die if you ever took your love away
Oh and I'd just die if you ever took your love away
Would you miss me if I was gone and all the simple things were lost?
Would you ever wait on me to say
Oh that I’d just die if you ever took your love away
And I can still recall the hour when you first let down your walls
I thought I might've died right there floating up above it all
But it scared you love, to need someone, so you killed it all instead
But in the mist up on Mulholland, I could've sworn I heard you say


And did you miss me when I was gone?
And the simple things we used to rely on?
Who came to wipe your tears away?
Who came to bring back your dignity baby?
And who came to drive you around this town
Like I used to drive you all around with the radio on
Through the mist on Mulholland1Embed
