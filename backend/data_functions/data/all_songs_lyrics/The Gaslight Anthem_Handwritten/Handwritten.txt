Handwritten Lyrics
Pull it out, turn it up
What's your favorite song
That's mine
I've been crying to it since I was young
I know there's someone out there
Feeling just like I feel
I know they're waiting up
I know they're waiting to hear
And I've been holding my breath
I've been holding my breath
For too many years to count, too many years to count

And we waited for the sirens that never come
And we only write by the moon
Every word handwritten
And to ease the loss of youth
And how many years I've missed you
Pages bleed forgiveness
Every word handwritten

Let it out, let me in
Take a hold of my hand
There's nothing like another soul
That's been cut up the same
And did you want to drive without a word in between
I can understand you need a minute to breathe
And to sew up the seams
After all this defeat â€“ and all this defeat

Here in the dark I cherish the moonlight
I'm in love with the way you're in love with the night
And it travels from heart to limb to pen


Every word handwritten
Every word handwritten
And with this pen, I thee wed
From my heart to your distress
Every word handwritten1Embed
