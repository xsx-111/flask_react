Desire LyricsWhat makes a man do the things that a man does
To be the very thing he perceives would capture your heart?
What does it feel like inside?
Does it hurt you at night?
Or does it keep you alive, and set you on fire, on fire?
I would give anything for the touch of your skin
Yes, I would burn here for years
Up in desire, desire
What makes a woman believe in a man such as me?
Unworthy to sit at your foot or your crown
I can only let you down
What does it feel like inside?
Does it hurt you at night?
Or does it keep you alive and set you on fire, on fire?
I would give anything for the touch of your skin
Yes, I would burn here for years
Up in desire, desire
And some men spend their lives
Chasing the accolades of pride
But that just never crossed my mind
You were always on my mind
What does it feel like inside?
Does it hurt you at night?
Or does it keep you alive, and set you on fire, on fire?
I would give anything for the touch of your skin
Yes, I would burn here for years
Up in desire, desireEmbed
