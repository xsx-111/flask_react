Howl Lyrics
Hey wake it up! Hey shake it out!
Does anything still move you since you're educated now?
And all grown up and traveled so well
Do you still hear the sound of the thunder while you lie up by yourself

Like you waited on his call and made your plans for great escapes
And there used to be a movement in the way your dress would wave
From your hips on down like electric through the ground

Now do you blow it out come Friday night?
See if you wanna, you can find me on the hood under the moonlight
Radio, oh radio, do you believe thereâ€™s still some magic left
Somewhere inside our souls
Like I waited on your call and made my plans to share my name
And I love the country movement and the way your dress would wave
From your hips on down like electric through the ground

Sound of the cars rushing the rain on the boulevard
In this city by the sea that has always haunted me
And belonged to me somehow
Bless your waters and your doubts
Bless your waters
Bless your doubts2Embed
