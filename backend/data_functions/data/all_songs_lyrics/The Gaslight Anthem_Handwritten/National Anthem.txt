National Anthem Lyrics
I never will forget you, my American love
And I'll always remember you, wild as they come
And though if I saw you, I'd pretend not to know
The place where you were in my heart is now closed
I already live with too many ghosts
Now everybody lately is living up in space
Flyin' through transmissions on invisible airwaves
With everything discovered, just waiting to be known
What's left for God to teach from his throne
And who will forgive us when he's gone
So take what you need now, honey
And do what you like
Don't worry 'bout me, mama
I'm alright

And I can't stand the weather, no, I never liked the rain
We drink on the job and we go home early
And I remember, she used to look so good in that dress
Now she just screams how I promised her more than this
Take it easy, baby, it ain't over yet
So take what you need now, honey
And do what you like
Don't worry 'bout me, mama
I'm alright

And if there's something you need
And if there's something you find
Whatever gets you through the night
Whatever gets you through the night
And I never will forget you, my American love
And I'll always remember you wild as they do come
