Too Much Blood LyricsAre you scared this sounds familiar?
What if everybody knew the very trials and temptations
That we put ourselves through?
Now I am no angel but I got nothing to hide
Can you say the same thing for yourself tonight?
What can I keep for myself if I tell you my hell?
What would be left to take to my grave?
And what's left for you, my lover to save?
What's left for only you to take?
If I put too much blood on the page
If I put too much blood on the page
And if I just tell the truth are there only lies left for you
If I put too much love on the page?
Now as my eternal witness to the pride and the shame
Are you worried I say too much?
Are you scared they'll take me away?
Now I am no devil but I've got things on my mind
And they're gonna come out and they're gonna come up time to time
What can I keep for myself if I tell you my hell?
What would be left to take to my grave?
And what's left for you, my lover to save?
What's left for only you to take?
If I put too much blood on the page
If I put too much blood on the page
And if I just tell the truth are there only lies left for you
If I put too much love on the page?
What can I keep for myself if I tell you my hell?
What would be left to take to my grave?
And what's left for you, my lover to save?
What's left for only you to take?
If I put too much blood on the page
If I put too much blood on the page
And if I just tell the truth are there only lies left for you
If I put too much blood on the page?
If I put too much blood on the page
If I put too much blood on the page againEmbed
