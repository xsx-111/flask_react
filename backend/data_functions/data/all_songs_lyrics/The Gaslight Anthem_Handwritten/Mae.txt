Mae LyricsStay the same, don't ever change
Cause I'd miss your ways
With your Bette Davis eyes
And your mama's party dress
While this city pumps its aching heart
For one more drop of blood
We work our fingers down to dust
And we wait for kingdom come
With the radio on
I wanna see you tonight
Would you come for a drive?
You can lean into me
If you ain't been in love for a while
I was born beside a river
That flows to a raging sea
That will one day serve to quell
Or one day be the death of me
In my faded jeans and far away eyes
And salty carnival kiss
That all my former lovers say
Was once magnificent
It's been so long Mae, so long
It's been so long Mae, so long
But since the radio's on...1Embed
