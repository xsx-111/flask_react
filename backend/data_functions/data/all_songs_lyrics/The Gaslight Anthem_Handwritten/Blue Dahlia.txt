Blue Dahlia Lyrics
What a hot and sultry summer
Steam just slides up off them streets
You gotta stay inside and wait for the night
And then come on over and see me
Cause there’s a poetry about these streets
And it slips from your skin and goes right underneath
And Mama always knew I’d meet a girl like you
But me, I never believed
Cause I’ve been so lonely I can’t imagine that kind of sympathy
Cause I’ve been so lonely I can’t imagine that kind of sympathy

Where’d you get them scars? How blue is your heart?
Is it sad enough to break, she said, “it’s sad enough to break.”
How long was your life? Was it cold and strange like mine?
Are you man enough to lay here?
She said, “I’m man enough, my baby, come see about me.”

I had a dream about you once
I could barely see your form
I met you between the wax and the needle
In the words of my favorite song
And your black hair was like a raven
With your tan skin on the beach
And your backdrop was the Auroras and my Sidekick was all this grief
And I been so low down, I been almost level with the ground
Where’d you get them scars? How blue is your heart?
Is it sad enough to break, she said, “it’s sad enough to break.”
How long was your life? Was it cold and strange like mine?
Are you man enough to lay here?
She said, “I’m man enough, my baby, come see about me.”

And did they take you to the carnival
To get locked up on a ride?
See me, I got caught up with the fortune tellers
And the ladies with the sleepy eyes
And it took years, my baby, just to come clean
Every street light, a reminder
And all those apologies...
And the night was lonely next to me
Even the night was lonely next to me

Where’d you get them scars?
How blue is your heart?
Is it sad enough to break, she said, “it’s sad enough to break.”
How long was your life?
Was it cold and strange like mine?
Are you man enough to lay here?
She said, “I’m man enough, my baby, come see about me.”
Come see about me
Come see about me
Come see about me
Whenever you’re lonely...2Embed
