Mystery Train LyricsOn the road to anywhere, in a place that exists without time
I met a girl who sang to me but her songs had no rhythm or rhyme
I couldn't feel, I could not think but my my what a colorful blind
As she sang in my mind
Let the deal go down - ride that mystery train
Break the whole thing down - start all over again
Let the deal go down - ride that mystery train
Welcome to the mystery - dreams float in a pool in my head
There's your mother when she was young
There's Uncle Dick looking sick and half dead
The lights are on and she is home, stretched out on a chodachrome bed
There's singing in my head
Let the deal go down - ride that mystery train
Break the whole thing down - start all over again
Let the deal go down - ride that mystery train
Let the deal go down, let the wild wind blow
Let the dreaming go, let the steel rain fall
Let the seed be sown, 'til everything is known
Let the deal go down, let the wild wind blow
Let the dreaming go
On the road to anywhere, in a place that exists without time
I met a girl who sang to me but her songs had no rhythm or rhyme
I couldn't feel, I could not think but my my what a colorful blind
As she sang in my mind
Let the deal go down - ride that mystery train
Break the whole thing down - start all over again
Let the deal go down - ride that mystery trainEmbed
