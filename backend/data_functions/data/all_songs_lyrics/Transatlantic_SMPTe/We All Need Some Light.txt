We All Need Some Light Lyrics
Some people think
Think they have none
They might as well stay down
Running in circles
Like bulls in a ring
'Til the sword finds it's way down
While the creep beats the rap on appeal
And the cop who can't stop
Shows the kids how to steal

And we all need some light now
We all need some light now
Yes, we all need some light now
Turn on your light and wash the darkness away

Hey you on the brink
Waiting to fall
To become human surplus
The movie's still shooting
You might still get the role
And man it's all just a circus
But the clown left town long ago
Maybe he'll come back and give us a show
'Cause we all need some light now
We all need some light now
Yes, we all need some light now
Turn on your light and wash the darkness away


We all need some light now
We all need some light now
Yes, we all need some light now
We all need some light right now
Are you waiting for the sword to find its way down
Remember when the sun was in your eyes
'Cause, we all need some light now
Turn on your light and wash the darkness awayEmbed
