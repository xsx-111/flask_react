My New World Lyrics
The place she called home was high on a hill
Way up in a big house under the trees
Day's in the sun she's seen by the river
Reading a book, feeding her dreams
Now she's a loner, now she's a stoner, no one can touch her ...
He was the boy, the pride of his mother
Stainless and shining, all heaven sent
But then the country calls for a soldier
And he went out to a foreign land
When he returned faces look different
At the end of innocence nothing's the same

My new world was spinning me around
And that was all that could be
My new world was spinning me around
And nothing's lost on memory
My new world was spinning me around...

Hiked up to Woodstock, she got high in Frisco
Summers of love, that child she was wild
She had the need for total expression
Painting and poetry filled up her mind
Boy, he took pride in serving his country
Went off to war no more than a child
My new world was spinning me around
And this is all that I've found
My new world was spinning me around
And time can be my enemy
My new world was spinning me...
Now she's a loner, now she's a stoner, no one can touch her...
Out in the fields we met in the summer
On a poetic island no past to recall
Breaking like waves we flooded the moment
Laughing at the perfectness of it all
My new world waits patiently
When living is lost in a memory
My new world is ahead of me
But sometimes I'm back where I used to be...
Then the fall ran away with our time

Disappointment struck him hard
When he found out there was no
"Lucky stars and stripes"
They set it all on fire!!!
While Jim and Janis got us higher
"She's so freaky, she's so fine"
Soldier, he can't get her off his mind
Down the desert to the sea
Leave the raving 60's all behind...

Out of the blue still reaching for something
Feeling the window of time out of mind
Catching a glimpse each one to the other
Always not knowing the spark left behind
Going and going with fictional borders
Passing and passing two feet from the door
My new world keeps spinning me around
And this is all that can be
My new world is ahead of me now
This is all that I've found
My new world keeps spinning me around
My new world keeps spinning me
And time is not my enemy
My new world's ahead of me today
And all things pass away...Embed
