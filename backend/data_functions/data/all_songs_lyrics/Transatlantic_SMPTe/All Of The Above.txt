All Of The Above Lyrics
In a state of fallen grace
With a smile upon its face, it came!
Full moon rising today
Like a child but fully grown
Like a star but not so far away
It came here to take me away
This has never been before
While the sun burns bright as day
Light the sky - hold back no more
Let the full moon rise today
Full moon rising today
So there I was with my complaints
In the comfort of my restraints I stayed
I stayed and had nothing to say
But there it was returning for my eyes
Like a fire that's been burning up the skies
Full moon rising today
This has never been before
While the sun burns bright as day
Light the sky - hold back no more
Let the full moon rise today
Full moon rising today

There's a town I used to know
There's a place I used to go to play
Laughin' all the way
Never thought of where I'd been
Autumn wind came creepin' in one day
Now summer's gone away
Summer's gone away ... hey
When October winds lay down
When the heat can't melt the ground
And nothing matters anyway
When October winds take hold
When you're down that dank dark road
Maybe nothing matters anyway

Dead on your feet you walk like no one's home
Out on the street you make your way alone
Soldier of fortune camouflaged in blue
Dawn turns to dusk you sail away in doubt
Love turns to lust you've turned it inside out
Soldier of fortune camouflaged in blue (but I know you)
All that you are is not the things you do
You know it's true
All that you are is camouflaged in blue
You know it's true
Dead on your feet you walk like no one's home
Out on the street you make your way alone
Soldier of fortune camouflaged in blue
But I know you now

Don't just sit there wasting your time on the phone
Don't be with that skank 'cause it hurts to be alone
And you swarm around like bees to the hive
And you look a man in full but you're half alive
One flew south, one to the east; one went to the west
You became the enemy just to be the best
Waiting for your dream to arrive
You're whole and you're complete but you're half alive
Waiting for your dream to arrive
You're whole and you're complete but you're half alive

Pressed to the wall of the rail station hall is the Venus de Milo
You walk through the park 'til the clouds seem to darken the sky
And you wish you could soften your mind
But you feel like they've locked you in time
And you think you'll be perfectly fine once you get to the water
Suddenly you stop 'cause your feet just won't walk
Like there's someone awaiting
The moon seems alive and looks down on your life just to say
It's alright
Innocence and undying love will reign
Innocence and undying love will reign
Hearing the call with your back to the wall in a wordless conundrum
Half of your life 'tween a rose and a knife ain't it time?
You're sure to find
Innocence and undying love will reign
Innocence and undying love will reign
The world will soon be right again
Innocence and undying love will reign
The world will soon be right again
Innocence and undying love will reign

In a state of fallen grace, with a smile upon it's face, it came!
... full moon rising today
While the clock is turning fast, soak it up before it's passed away
Let it become what it may
This has never been before
While the sun burns bright as day
Light the sky - hold back no more
Let the full moon rise today, full moon rising today
Full moon rising today, full moon rising todayEmbed
