Supervixen Lyrics

Come down to my house, stick a stone in your mouth
You can always pull out, if you like it too much

Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsession
There'll be nothing but this thing that you'll never doubt

A hit is hard to resist and I never miss
I can take you out with just a flick of my wrist

Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsession
There is nothing but this thing that you'll never doubt
This thing you'll never doubt


And I'll feed your obsession
The falling star that you cannot live without
I will be your religion
This thing you'll never doubt
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Now I want it too much
Now I want it to stop
Now I'm lucky like a falling star fell over me
Yeah, you worry too much
Now it's got to be stopped
Now I'm lucky like a falling star fell over me
Now I want it too much
Now I want it to stop
Now I'm lucky like a falling star fell over me
Yeah, you worry too much
Now it's got to be stopped
Now I'm lucky like a falling star fell over me3Embed
