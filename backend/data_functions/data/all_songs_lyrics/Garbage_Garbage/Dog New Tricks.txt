Dog New Tricks Lyrics
I wish I had not woke up today
Everyone mistakes the things you say
Take the simple truth and
Twist it all around
Make it sound important
Make it seem profound

Dog new tricks
Nothing you learn will stick
Dog new tricks
You make me feel so worthless

Everyone I know has gone away
Died or left or just forgot to stay
Sometimes took for granted
Sometimes turned away
Sometimes didn't say what
I meant to say

Dog new tricks
Nothing you learn will stick
Dog new tricks
You make me feel so worthless
Nothing you learn
Nothing you learn
Nothing you learn
Nothing you learn

I never would have pegged you
For what you have become
Everyone lies
Everyone cheats
Not like you've done

Dog new tricks
Nothing you learn will stick (nothing will stick)
Dog new tricks
You make me feel so worthless (nothing will stick)
Dog new tricks (nothing will stick)
Nothing you learn will stick (nothing will stick)
Dog new tricks (nothing will stick)
You make me feel so worthless (nothing will stick)
Nothing you learn
Nothing you learn
Nothing you learn
Nothing you learn1Embed
