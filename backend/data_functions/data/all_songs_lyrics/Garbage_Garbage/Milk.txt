Milk Lyrics
I am milk
I am red hot kitchen
And I am cool
Cool as the deep blue ocean

I am lost
So I am cruel
But I'd be love and sweetness
If I had you

I’m waiting, I’m waiting for you
I’m waiting, I’m waiting for you

I am weak
But I am strong
I can use my tears to
Bring you home

I’m waiting, I’m waiting for you
I’m waiting, I’m waiting for you
I’m waiting, I’m waiting for you
I am milk
I am red hot kitchen
And I am cool
Cool as the deep blue ocean

I’m waiting, I’m waiting for you
I’m waiting, I’m waiting for you
I’m waiting, I’m waiting for you
I’m aching, I’m aching for you

I’m waiting
I’m waiting
I’m waiting for you5Embed
