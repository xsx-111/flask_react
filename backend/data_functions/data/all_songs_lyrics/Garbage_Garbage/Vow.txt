Vow Lyrics
I can't use what I can't abuse
And I can't stop when it comes to you

You burned me out but I'm back at your door
Like Joan of Arc coming back for more

I nearly died
I nearly died
I nearly died

I came to cut you up
I came to knock you down
I came around to tear your little world apart
I came to shut you up
I came to drag you down
I came around to tear your little world apart
And break your soul apart

You burn and burn to get under my skin
You've gone too far now I won't give in
You crucified me but I'm back in your bed
Like Jesus Christ coming back from the dead
I nearly died
I nearly died
I nearly died

I came to knock you up
I came to cut you down
I came around to tear your little world apart
I came to rip you up
I came to shut you down
I came around to tear your little world apart
And break your soul apart


I nearly died
Oh, I nearly died
I nearly died

I came to cut you up
I came to knock you down
I came around to tear your little world apart
I came to shut you up
I came to suck you down
I came around to tear your little world apart
Tear your little world apart
Tear your little world apart
And break your soul apart
I can't stop when it comes to you
I can't stop when it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you

I feel upset, so let's do some celebrating
I feel upset, let's do some celebrating
'Cause every time I see your dick
I see her cunt in my bed
'Cause every time I see your dick
I see her cunt in my bed
You ain't gonna need no little boat
No, you ain't gonna need no little boat
'Cause you're living on my time, my dear

The birds do it, the bees do it
So let's do it, let's fall in love
The birds do it, the bees do it
Even sentimental fools do it
So let's do it, let's fall in love
Just one more time
Just one more time for me
Just one more time, boys
Just one more time for me
I need a lover, I don't need to love
I need a lover who's so drunk he cannot fuck
I need a lover, I don't need to love
I need a lover who's so drunk he cannot fuck
Oh-oh, they don't love you like I love you
Oh-oh, they don't love you like I love you
Oh-oh, they don't love you like I love you
Oh-oh, they don't love you like I love you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh2Embed
