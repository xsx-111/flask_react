As Heaven Is Wide Lyrics
Nothing that you say will release you
Nothing that you pray would forgive you
Nothing's what your words mean to me
Something that you did will destroy me
Something that you said will stay with me
Long after you're dead and gone

If flesh could crawl
My skin would fall
From off my bones
And run away from here

As far from God
As heaven is wide
As far from God
As angels can fly

If holy is as holy does
This house will burn straight down to hell
And take its conscience with it as it falls
Nothing said could change the fact
My trust was blind, you broke the pact
If God's my witness, God must be blind

If flesh could crawl
My skin would fall
From off my bones
And run away from here

As far from God
As heaven is wide
As far from God
As angels can fly

I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish

Take it back, I dare you, take it back
No, you can't, you should have thought of that
What's inside a man that goes so wrong?
Choke on guilt, that's far too good for you
Say one word, I'll laugh and bury you
And leave you in the place where you left me
If flesh could crawl
My skin would fall
From off my bones
And run away from here

As far from God
As heaven is wide
As far from God
As angels can fly

I wish I could fly
As angels can fly
I wish, I wish5Embed
