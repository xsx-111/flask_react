Not My Idea Lyrics
One, two, three

I bit my tongue and stood in line
With not much to believe in
I bought into what I was sold
And ended up with nothing

This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea

You thought that I would never see
What was meant for you was meant for me
I was distracted at the time
Forget about yours, now what about mine?

This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea
You thought I was a little girl
You thought I was a little mouse
You thought you'd take me by surprise
Now I'm here, burning down your house

This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea

Oh you’ve got blue eyes
Oh you’ve grey eyes
Oh you’ve got green eyes
Oh you’ve got blue eyes
Oh you’ve grey eyes
Oh you’ve got green eyes

Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright now1Embed
