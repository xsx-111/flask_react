Dinna-Dawg (and The Inevitable Onset Of Lunacy) LyricsThe midnight moon is feeling high
She won't come down till the morning light
When opposite set
Scenery drapes unimpressed plasticine
Where cookies cut can play their games
Wear the shirts of price tag names
All the biggies selling fame
Can smell your blood yearning
If that's what it costs, I am free
Don't contest electric light
Come pull the cord kiss me goodnight
Bound in blood, dollar signs confirmed
Your eyes still hold the secret
Shut your eyes don't breathe so loud
It's just an episode
Shut your eyes don't talk to loud
It's just an episode
If that's what it costs, then I am free
Doesn't this just smell familiar?
You cut your fingernails like your soul
If I ripped your heart right from you
Would you feel it?
Would you feel it at all?
Doesn't this just smell familiar?
A pretty penny now you paid your price
If I ripped your heart right from you
Would you feel it?
Would you feel it at all?
Would you feel it at all?
It all starts with a sound
And a firm embrace
The will to conspire
The need to suck-seed
Don't look down, now you're surrounded
Beady black eyes, lip licks and shrouded
Heart's beat constricted, foam-filled with plastic
Kiss kiss luxury, head's getting clouded
See the sparkle of the heretic's scream
The green gleam and the four-legged fiend
A flick of fountains and the kings been hailed
Don't worry baby cause we're all for sale
Doesn't this just smell familiar?
You cut your fingernails like your soul
If I ripped your heart right from you
Would you feel it?
Would you feel it at all?
Doesn't this just smell familiar?
A pretty penny now you paid your price
If I ripped your heart right from you
Would you feel it?
Would you feel it at all?
It surrounds
We'll like to dance around it
It surrounds
We'll like to dance around it
DON'T STOP NOW FEEL IT
It surrounds
We'll like to dance around it
It surrounds
We'll like to dance aroundEmbed
