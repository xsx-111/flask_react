Decrescendo LyricsAnd I knew that you just couldn't wait
To put your sharpened dagger in
And watch the look on my face
It was all you were searching for
A picture frame consistent
To being alone
Now we're content with illusions
And our arm length smiles
- -
Did you get what you wanted
Did you get what you wanted now
This is all that I'm asking
Cause it's the love we're forgetting how
Did you take what you wanted
Did you get what you wanted from me
This is all that I'm asking
This is all that I'm asking you
- -
Oh the years that have all been erased
No superficial shelter could ever replace
And it's all you we're searching for
Another adequate replacement
To walk through your door
We're content with illusions
And our downhill eyes
- -
Did you get what you wanted
Did you get what you wanted now
This is all that I'm asking
Cause it's the love I'm forgetting now
Did you get what you wanted
Did you take what you wanted from me
This is all that I'm asking
Yeah this is all that I'm asking
- -
Have you ever felt what it means to be truly alone?
Stop and think right now
Have you ever been alone?
Have you ever felt so cold?
Have you ever felt to truly alone?
So freezing cold?
So find the fakest elation I hope it takes you away
And I've got it all worked out now
Just a memory, picture framed illusion
- -
Did you get what you wanted
Did you get what you wanted now
This is all that I'm asking
Cause its the love I'm forgetting how
Did you get what you wanted
Did you take what you needed from me
This is all that I'm asking
This is all that I'm asking
- -
Did you get what you wanted?
NOW!!!!!!Embed
