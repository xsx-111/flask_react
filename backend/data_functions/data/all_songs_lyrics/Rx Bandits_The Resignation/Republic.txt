Republic LyricsYou can never be what never was
And to get by you know you must become a part in a machine
When minds outgrow a stationary scene
They get discarded with the others never meant to be
With the worst yet to be seen
Cause we still eat this fruit from the tree that's in the middle of this garden
And we make a bargain
- -
Have you forgotten?
You're still dying in their world
Just to be seen not to be heard
It happens so often
There's no way left to break out from this hold
Of who will be bought and who will be sold
- -
Don't have to look to see it everyday
It is designed for you to think that there's no other way
If you got the look they'll sell you're sound
There will be dollars all around but when decisions come
You'll find that you still have no say
It doesn't bother most that
That's the game
We've all been blinded by the opportunity to play
If you say what you want and you do what you say
Than it's likely that you've found yourself a better way
- -
Have you forgotten?
You're still dying in their world
Just to be seen not to be heard
It happens so often
There's no way left to break out from this hold
Of who will be bought and who will be sold
- -
We're still waiting in lines
And we're still signing with our blood
It's all that you mentioned
It's all been no good
Well it's the right that we haven't
Forgotten the plan
It's our LOVE that we're doubting
Have you forgotten?Embed
