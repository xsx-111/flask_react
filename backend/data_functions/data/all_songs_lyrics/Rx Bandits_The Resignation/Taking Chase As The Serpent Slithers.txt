Taking Chase As The Serpent Slithers LyricsYeah she moves so slowly like a lover's breath
Hoping I can hold it down and stand
But the aches and shakes don't seem to let up, no no
I got so many questions, and
She has all the answers for me now
Oh I don't believe it, no I don't believe her now
- -
One more hope for tomorrow
Baby, one more kiss to forget you
Right, just what will bring us down
It keeps us together remembering
It's so easy to forget
It's so easy to forget
When I move so slow darling
- -
Yeah she moves so slowly like a lover's breath
Hoping I can tear down the walls and breathe what I never knew
All this girl could get into
I've got so many questions
And she got all the answers for me now
Oh I can't believe her, no I don't believe it now
- -
One more hope for tomorrow
One more drink to forget
Just what will bring us down
Keeps us together remembering
It's so easy to forget
- -
When I'm inside her I don't think twice
When she's in my blood you know it feels so nice
Shaking in the morning like I've been kicked all night
When she's in my blood you know it feels so nice
I'm shaking in the morning like I've been kicked all night
Sneaky sneaky serpent with the tricks up his sleeve
- -
Lips like licorice but you can't catch me
Deep between the covers listening to her heart's beat
Till defeat and surrender of what's being covered up
Cause I don't want to give up what's little left of my luck
So many opportunities that are boarded up and gently put away
You move so slowly I can't even feel it moving
- -
You move so slowly I can't believe itEmbed
