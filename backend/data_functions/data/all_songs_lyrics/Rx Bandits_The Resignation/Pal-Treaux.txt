Pal-Treaux LyricsWhat you want is what you find out
Once you believe that you don't really need it
Here we are at the rest of our lives and I'm afraid
That we no longer need it
- -
I'll wait for the next one
It looks like our time here is done
Memories of moments past
The callous that you can't give back
The moon bows to the new sun
I'll wait for the next
- -
The etch of scars and memories pass
Once you conceive that you don't want to feel it
After all
We all bled so much and
It's about time
That we all started living
- -
I'll wait for the next one
It looks like our time here is done
Memories of moments past
The callous that you can't give back
The moon bows to the new sun
I'll wait for the next
- -
You taste so sweet for only me
It hurts so much to lose completely
We only fight
- -
What you want and what we find out once you believe
That you no longer need it
Well here we are at the spectacle of our sight and I'm afraid
That I'm a slave
What you want is what you find out
Once you believe
You no longer NEED it
- -
I'll wait for the next one
It looks like our time here is done
Memories of moments past
The callous that you can't give back
The moon bows to the new sun
I'll wait for the next
- -
You taste so sweet for only me
It hurts so much to lose completely
We only fight (what it is to desire)Embed
