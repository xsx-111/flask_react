Never Slept So Soundly LyricsCouldn't see the moon
When she came tonight
Emptiness inside her filled my room
I know it's only distance but it feels just like the end
I won't ask this same old question
Adamant resistance to my lasting desires
Searching for an explanation to why I sleep alone
Oh I'm not driving anymore if you call you just use my name
Let these clenched fists open wide to see where all the answers lie
- -
Looking for a sign that I'm still alive
With these pilled up smiles and these sloppy eyes yeah
Oh isnt that the truth?
And all the hollow whisperings from between your sheets
All the maybes in the world don't mean anything now
Pray its over soon
Never slept so soundly than with your breath on myneck
- -
The present has no future
The future has no past
The past is just a graveyard
For the lonely ghost REGRET
It's so hard to say goodbye
When I shake too much to hold
Let this blood within me run
So I can see the answers dry
- -
Looking for a sign that I'm still alive
With this junky smile and these sloppy eyes
Oh isnt that the truth?
And all the hollow whisperings from between your sheets
All the maybes in the world dont mean anything now
I pray its over soon
- -
Finding our directions
Stumble
Stagger
Fall Away
- -
Finding our direction
Let it lead the way
Part of what you borrowed
Can never be replaced
So pardon my deflection baby
There's no more blood to bleed
But if I can I'll be sewin up the seeds
Picking up whats left of me
(to sing together)
- -
Looking for a sign that I'm still alive
With these pilled up smiles and these sloppy eyes
Oh isn't that the truth?
And all the hollow whisperings from between the sheets
All the maybes in the world don't mean a thing, yeah
Isn't that the truth?
- -
And now I'm looking for reason that I'm still alive with
This pilled up smile and these junkie eyes
Isn't that the truth?
And all the hollow whisperings from between your sheets
All the maybes in the world don't mean anything now
Pray it's over soon
- -
I never slept so soundly
Than with your breath on my neckEmbed
