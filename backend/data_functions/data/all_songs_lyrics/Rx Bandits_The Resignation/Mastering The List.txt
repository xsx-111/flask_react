Mastering The List LyricsDon't be afraid, because there is no escape
And it won't be long now, won't be long now
They got you thinking what you wanna believe
Just to fall with no better way
When you wear the right clothes, sing the right songs
Buy it, and turn it on
When you date the right crowd
Drive the right car
Tune in, and plug it on
Came looking here for answers
And all you found was
Questions for forgiveness
We're giving ourselves away
Human life replacement
Love is gone to waste
Questions for forgiveness
We're giving ourselves away
Human life replacement
Love is gone to waste
But now
We're finding out
That we know better
No number will ever replace me
We're finding out
That we know better
No number will ever replace me
First comes to school
Then comes the job
Wife and two kids
And a family car
We're falling in line
And waiting to die
And forward a block on the wall
And another new award
On a corporate statistic
Of a government job
Well, I don't need no reading
For the beat of my heart
You nihilists working over
Because you're tooting your horn
Because your feeding is to
Strangle art in every form
Came looking here for answers
And all you found was
Questions for forgiveness
We're giving ourselves away
Human life replacement
Love is gone to waste
Questions for forgiveness
We're giving ourselves away
Human life replacement
Love is gone to waste
But now
We're finding out
That we know better
No number will ever replace me
We're finding out
That we know better
No number will ever replace me
Came looking here for answers
And all you found was questions
Came looking here for answers
And all you found was
Questions for forgiveness
We're giving ourselves away
Human life replacement
Love is gone to waste
Questions for forgiveness
We're giving ourselves away
Human life replacement
Love is gone to waste
But now
We're finding out
That we know better
No number will ever replace me
We're finding out
That we know better
No number will ever replace meEmbed
