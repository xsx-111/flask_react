Prophetic LyricsOur Eyes are bleeding
Courtesy of everything that you could ever want to hide
Our veins are dry
Sometimes the truth cuts deeper than the sharpest knife
- -
Losin' is an awkward feeling
When you're bleeding down
Anything to stop the burning
We've been runnin' all around
- -
We just survive
Too busy occupied with dying to stop and consider life
So many pretty pretty pictures
On the walls and on our fingertips
Well, let's sew the borders round it
- -
Losin' is an awkward feeling
When your bleeding down
Ain't no way to stop the burning
We've been running all around ourselves
And it's the choices that we choose
In our everyday abuse
Just a short solution to a long term problem
- -
I stabbed myself just for the scar
To see if I could feel something
And it's the choices that we choose
Cause we're all prophetic fools
Just a short solution to a long term problem
- -
I need (x4)
Just one more thing
To be completely blinded
Shoot it up, shoot it in, bleeding under all this callous skin
In a way, I've been feeling incomplete
- -
Losin' is an awkward feeling
When your beating down
Anything to stop the burning
We've been running all around ourselves
And it's the choices that we choose
In our everyday abuse
Just a short solution to a long term problem
--
I stabbed myself just for the scar
To see if I could feel something
And it's the choices that we choose
Cause we're all prophetic fools
Just a short solution to a long term problem, everyone
- -
Innocence is way overrated now
Choking this sober feeling down
I guess you've come over me
So define lonely (x3)
(Now I know real love is for free)Embed
