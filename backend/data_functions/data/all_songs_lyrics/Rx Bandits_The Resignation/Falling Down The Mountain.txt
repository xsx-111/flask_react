Falling Down The Mountain LyricsWould you believe what I said if I shoved it down your throat?
(how unusual the lettered backdrop)
Do you wonder where you are, the meaning of the words?
(push the plunger, say goodbye)
Consent to manufacture, a brand new opposition
It's starting right now
- -
Up and down we spend in all conditions
For many years I played the fool
Locked so deep inside that we can't see
Much too bored to look for
- -
Touch the surface flow and ebb with nowhere left to go
(if I could only live like this)
Ideal in its birth, a drunk bewildered herd
(follow the leader, come pin the tail)
Caught in misdirection, our spectacle distracts
It's just the right time
- -
Up and down we spend in all conditions
For many years I played the fool
Locked so deep inside that we can't see
Much too bored to look for
- -
We always say it, we never mean it
If that's enough
That's the way it looks and no one's asking why
It's the right time but we don't have the time
Keep it locked down, it's only what your heart would say
We're barely living through it, we're just surviving
I'm so sick of surviving
- -
Pullin under to stay ahead
We always say what we don't mean
Up and down we spend in all conditions
For many years I played the fool
But if it's out for deception and still playing cool
Like a piece of the puzzle we're so quick to salute it now
Much too bored to look for
- -
We didn't say it, we never needed it
If that's enough
It's the way we look and no one's askin' why
It's the right right time but we don't have the time
Keep it locked down ignoring what your heart would say
We're barely living through it, too scared to do it
We're so sick of survivingEmbed
