Newsstand Rock (Exposition) LyricsNow America's got a brand new war
Can anybody tell me what we're fighting for?
Time to manufacture the illusion of safety
Don't fear, just consume to uphold the economy
Yeah we always buy everything that they're sellin'
Everything that they're sellin'
- -
Payin' for the bombs that fall on our children
Now we're headed for our own demise
Dreaming of another mushroom cloud horizon
And that's the bottom line
It's time to cancel my subscription
I just can't stomach anymore of the lies
Violence equals violence and it's no solution
And that's the bottom line
- -
Now turn on the radio and hear what it's sayin'
Another hollow candy coated melody about nothing
Easier to sell it don't require you to think
Dumbed down drool, a facade suck-cess
We're still buyin' everything that they're sellin'
Everything that they're sellin'
- -
Now I'm lookin for the truth and solid meaning
So I can scrape the glass of both of my eyes
Stuffed to the gills with a false sense of stubstance
And now I realize
So its time to cancel my subscription
I just can't stomach anymore of the lies
Wealth the spectacle of a greedy solution and that's the bottom line
- -
Now I'm not buyin' anything that they're sellin'
Not givin' in this time
- -
Payin' for the bombs that fall on our children
Now we're headed for our own demise
Dreaming of another mushroom cloud horizon
And that's the bottom line
So it's time to cancel my subscription
I just can't stomach anymore of the lies
Violence equals violence and it's no solution
And that's the bottom lineEmbed
