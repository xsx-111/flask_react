Overcome (The Recapitulation) LyricsWe've had
We've had enough of the politicians
We've had enough yeah
Of these politician's wars
All we need right now is love
We've had enough of these military scoreboards
What we need right now is love, come on
We've had enough of these politician's wars
All we need right now is love
We've had enough of these military scoreboards
What we need right now is love

(Turn it up)
The future is held in the hands who write the textbooks
Ignorance is bred when falsified thinking is taught
To the youth instead of past mistakes and mind elevation
Like the graves that manifest destiny has created
So we can build our capitalist consumer based economy
To build, market, and sell commodities we don't need
But we are trained to believe like celebrity imaging
Well I'm here to take my feelings back and I hope that you will be with me

I can't wait for that day when I hear us all screaming
Ahhhhhhhhh
I can't wait for that day when I hear us all singing together
Ooooohhhhhh
I can't wait for that day when I hear us all screaming
Ahhhhhhhhh
I can't wait for that day when I hear us all singing together
Ahhh

(Come on)
I can't wait for the day when I hear us all screaming
HERE COMES THE REVOLUTION
When every race, color, and creed of militant human beings stand up
With fists together for substance and true meaning
Because right now we got our feet stuck in cement
We're too caught up in a material status quo punishment
And one thing is for sure and that's the sun will always set
Darling, you can bet our moon is quite the opposite
So baby take a axe to your makeup kit
Set ablaze the billboards and their advertisements
Love with all your hearts and never forget
How good it feels to be alive and strive for your desire
Just cause you can't see your cage doesn't mean that you are free
When there are laws against nature but it's ok for you to be
Addicted to over-the-counter prescriptions
And magazines dictate all our human relations
- -
I'm not buying, no I'm not giving in
To a culture that objectifies all of our women
I'm not buying, no I'm not consuming
The apathetic dribble on the news media's chin
I'm not buying, no I'm not giving in
The lies that are sold through textbooks to children
I'm not buying, no I'm not consuming
'Cause the positive will always overcome the negative, right
- -
And we stay inside, it's right outside, we stand in line
We all enjoy the fences to keep it at bay
But I'm not giving inEmbed
