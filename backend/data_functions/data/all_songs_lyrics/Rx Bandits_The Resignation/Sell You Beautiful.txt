Sell You Beautiful LyricsLook who's got a new nose
Plastic lips and fake tits
Ever tasted silicon?
I've got scars on my eyes
Look who is the best dressed
Oh my gosh the worst hair
Who designed that mink coat?
I've got stars in my eyes
Guess who's got a new car?
Bet she dates a rockstar
I wanna make a million
I've got lies in my mouth
Eyeshadow and glitter gold
Diamond rings and lip syncs
Anything material
I've got scars on my eyes
Baby you know if you're not beautiful
Just cover it up
With make-up kits and perforated scalpel seams
We'll do you right up
I'm so obsessed with looking like the celebrities
Make myself throw up
But it's all right cause one day I know I'll be fine like everyone else
And it's alright
Music played to advertise
Logo shirts and hair styles
Chop and cut monopolize
I've got scars in my mouth
Worship to the cash cow
Nod your head now take a bow
Faking grins and cleft chins
I've got stars in my eyes
Baby you know if you're not beautiful
Just cover it up
With make-up kits and perforated scalpel seams
We'll do you right up
I'm so obsessed with looking like celebrities
Make myself throw up
With staple skin and back stab flattery
I'm coughin' it up
Hey little darlin' I'll sell you the definition
If you follow me through pages and channels of deceit where
Everyone is perfect and nobody grows old
Your bliss in the ignorance of images
'Cause beautiful is what they're sellin'
(It's not how you feel it's only how you look!!!!)Embed
