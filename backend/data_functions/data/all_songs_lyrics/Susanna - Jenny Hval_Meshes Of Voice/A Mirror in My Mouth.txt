A Mirror in My Mouth LyricsI'm a house of bones. Skin stretched over walls, a mirror in my mouth
Let your golden rays hit my frozen face, a cataract of sound
Let your honey drip from your fingertips, O let me have your lips
Your lips of gold of whispering the lips
My gaze spills your blood through the body
Each drop makes a coral in the sea
My skin was forged out of seaweed
And out of spit my children grow churning in my mouthEmbed
