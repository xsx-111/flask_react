The Black Lake Took LyricsI woke and found outside my door a black lake rippling against the hand
Its tongues lick the flesh from my bones and replace skin with waves
A bulging eye
I called into the black lake and dove head over heels into the water
And pulled out my heart from the seaweed
A pounding eye
Oh it's golden, it's golden, it's golden
The black lake took and the black lake gave1Embed
