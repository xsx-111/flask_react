I Have Walked This Body LyricsI have walked this body to the rim of its ends
From there I have seen everything else
It was there I felt the flexing of the bicep
And the sudden swing of hips
The traffic island of the heart
(This is where my story begins)
A basilica of stone waiting for skin
I stood on the rims and carved the tree rings inEmbed
