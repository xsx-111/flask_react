Black Lake LyricsI wake and find outside
My door a black lake
Rippling against the hand
The wall behind me
A bulging eye
I lift and sink with ebb and flow
My heart is a black lake
Rippling inside my chest
The wall between us
A bulging embrace
I woke to find that I have lost my soul
Where my soul was there is a big black hole
Hollow hollow hollow hollow hollow...
The black lake took and the black lake gaveEmbed
