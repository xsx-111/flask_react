Dawn LyricsDawn came quiet
Dawn came cool
The inside of my eyelid
Is glazed with honey dew
Dawning beauty
Is dazzling me
The hissing of her body
Is pleasure to my ears
I can see that she is laying down open
The pleasant apple-milk from the breast
Luring and enticing
A poor soul like me
To a certain death inside her chewing mouthEmbed
