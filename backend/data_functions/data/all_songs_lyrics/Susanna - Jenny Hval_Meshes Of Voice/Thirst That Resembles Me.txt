Thirst That Resembles Me LyricsThis is a thirst that resembles me
Sparks do find us
How do you smell it?
How do you know?
How do you spell it?
This is a thirst to enter
This is a thirst glazed with honey dew, honey dew
This is a thirst that resembles me
Inside I'm glowing
This is a thirst that resembles me
Sparks do find us
Sparks outline us
From the inside...Embed
