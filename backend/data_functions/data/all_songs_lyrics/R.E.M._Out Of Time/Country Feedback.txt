Country Feedback Lyrics
One, two, three, four

This flower is scorched, this film is on
On a maddening loop
These clothes
These clothes don't fit us right
And I'm to blame
It's all the same, it's all the same

You come to me with a bone in your hand
You come to me with your hair curled tight
You come to me with positions
You come to me with excuses ducked out in a row
You wear me out, you wear me out

We've been through fake breakdowns
Self-hurt, plastics, collections
Self-help, self-pain, EST, psychics, fuck all
I was central, I had control, I lost my head
I need this, I need this
A paperweight, a junk garage, a winter rain, a honey pot
Crazy, all the lovers have been tagged
A hotline, a wanted ad, it's crazy what you could've had
It's crazy what you could've had
It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this
It's crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had
I need it, I need this
It's crazy what you could've had
It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I, I, need this
It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this
It's crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this

Crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had1Embed
