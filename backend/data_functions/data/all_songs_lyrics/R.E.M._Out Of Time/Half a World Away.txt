Half a World Away Lyrics
This could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
I turn to a miracle, high-alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away, here in my head

Sworn to go it alone and hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Go it alone, hold it along
And hold

Oh, lonely deeps and hollows
Are half a world, half a world away
My shoes are gone, my life is spent
I had too much to drink
I didn't think, I didn't think of you
I guess that's all I needed

To go it alone and hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
And hold
Oh, this lonely world is wasted
Pathetic eyes, high-alive
Blind eye that turns to see
The storm it came up strong
It shook the trees and blew away our fear
I couldn't leave it here

To go it alone, hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Go it alone and hold it along
And hold
Go it alone and hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
And hold

Oh, this could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high-alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away to goEmbed
