Texarkana Lyrics
Twenty-thousand miles to an oasis
Twenty-thousand years will I burn
Twenty-thousand chances I've wasted
Waiting for the moment to turn

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

Walking through the woods, I have faced it
Looking for something to learn
Thirty-thousand thoughts have been wasted
Never in my time to return

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

All my life
Waiting to find
Forty-thousand stars in the evening
Look at them fall from the sky
Forty-thousand reasons for living
Forty-thousand tears in your eyes

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

Catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
(Catch me if I fall)
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fallEmbed
