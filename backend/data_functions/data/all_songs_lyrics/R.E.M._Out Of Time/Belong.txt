Belong Lyrics
Her world collapsed early Sunday morning
She got up from the kitchen table, folded the newspaper, and silenced the radio
Those creatures jumped the barricades and have headed for the sea, sea

Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh

Those creatures jumped the barricades and have headed for the sea
She began to breathe, to breathe at the thought of this freedom
Stood and whispered to her child, "Belong"
She held the child and whispered, with calm calm, "Belong"

Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh

She stood and whispered to her child, "Belong"
She held the child and whispered with calm calm, "Belong"

Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Those barricades can only hold for so long
Her world collapsed early Sunday morning
She took the child, held tight, opened the window
A breath, this song, how long? And knew, knew, "Belong"

Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh-whoa-oh-ohEmbed
