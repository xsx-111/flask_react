Near Wild Heaven Lyrics
Whenever we hold each other
We hold each other
There's a feeling that's gone
Something has gone wrong
And I don't know how much longer I can take it
House made of heart, break it
Take my head in your hands and shake it
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven
(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

Whatever it takes, I'm giving
It's just a gift I'm given
Trying to live inside
Trying to move inside
And I always thought that it would make me smarter
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba, ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
But it's only made me harder
My heart thrown open wide
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough
(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven
(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Near wild heaven
(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven
(Living inside, living inside, lliving inside)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Near wild heaven

(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
I'm holding my hands together
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
Holding my feet together
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
Holding myself together
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough

(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba) Near wild heaven
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Near wild heaven
(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba) Near wild heaven
(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Near wild heaven
(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba) Near wild heaven
(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Near wild heavenEmbed
