Me in Honey Lyrics
I sat there looking ugly, looking ugly and mean
Knew what you were saying, you were saying to me
Baby's got some new rules, baby said she's had it with me

It seems a shame to waste your time on me
It seems a lot to waste your time for me
Left me to love what it's doing to me

There's a lot of honey in this world
Baby, this honey's for me
Got to do what you do, do it with me

It seems a shame to waste your time for me
Left me to love what it's doing to me

Knocked silly, knocked flat, sideways down
These things, they pick you up and they turn you around
Say your piece, say you're sweet for me

It's all the same to share the pain with me
It's all the same to save the shame for me
Left me to love what it's doing to me
Baby's got some new rules, baby says she's had it with me
There's a fly in the honey, and baby's got a baby with me

That's a part, that's a part of me
Left me to love what it's doing to me
Left me to love what it's doing to me

What about me?
What about me?Embed
