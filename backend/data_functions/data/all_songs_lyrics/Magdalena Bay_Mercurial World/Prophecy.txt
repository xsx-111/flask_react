Prophecy Lyrics
Always wanted to believe
In some destiny to guide me
Found no answers in my dreams
No constellations that could show me

Up until you floated down on a cloud
I didn’t know, I didn’t know
In your pure perfection, I’ll never doubt
Now I know, now I know
Let’s lay here just a little longer

Won’t you be my prophecy?
You’re the only one I need
When you’re lying next to me
I don’t need no make believe
Won’t you be my prophecy?
You’re the only one I need
When you’re lying next to me
You’re so real and I believe

Bury me in white sheets
Neighbor’s music drifts through concrete
With your arms around me
I don’t ever want to be free
Up until you floated down on a cloud
I didn’t know, I didn’t know
In your pure perfection, I’ll never doubt
Now I know, now I know
Let’s lay here just a little longer

Won’t you be my prophecy?
You’re the only one I need
When you’re lying next to me
I don’t need no make believe
Won’t you be my prophecy?
You’re the only one I need
When you’re lying next to me
You’re so real and I believe


Won’t you be my prophecy?
You’re the only one I need
When you’re lying next to me
I don’t need no make believe
Won’t you be my prophecy? (I need)
You’re the only one I need (I need, I need)
When you’re lying next to me
You’re so real and I believeEmbed
