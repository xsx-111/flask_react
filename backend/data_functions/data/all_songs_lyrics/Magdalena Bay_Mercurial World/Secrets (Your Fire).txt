Secrets (Your Fire) Lyrics
Secrets
I don't wanna tell you everything about me
I don't wanna feed more oxygen to
Your fire, your fire
La-la-la-la-la

Online, anytime
Getting lost again
Worldwide, a paradigm
Make another friend

You think you know me
Wanna show me that you're super in the know
Getting lost again
But I might lose my mind
(La-la-la-la-la)

Secrets
I don't wanna tell you everything about me
I don't wanna feed more oxygen to
Your fire, your fire
La-la-la-la-la
Sickness
I just need to give you everything about me
I don't need to feed more oxygen to
Your fire, your firе
La-la-la-la-la
Now the place is on fire
This shit is firе
He's on fire
Dragon fire
Now the place is on fire

One time, two more times
Getting lost again
You're like just what I like
Make another friend

You think you know me
Wanna show me that you're super in the know
Getting lost again
My third eye prototype
(Pull me into your world)

Secrets
I don't wanna tell you everything about me
I don't wanna feed more oxygen to
Your fire, your fire
La-la-la-la-la
Sickness
I just need to give you everything about me
I don't need to feed more oxygen to
Your fire, your fire
La-la-la-la-la
(Now the place is on fire)
We're worldwide
(This shit's fire)
I want all your secrets
You're not gonna get my secrets
No secrets anymore
(Now the place is on fire)4Embed
