Chaeri Lyrics
Regrets
The things I should’ve said
Was I a bad friend?
It was only that bad with you
I’m sorry
Did you feel lonely?
I didn’t realize back then
It was really that bad for you

September started sweet
Then winter got so mean
The fruit left on my sheets
If I could do it all again, I would’ve said:

Chaeri, please
You’re killing me
It’s only that bad, it’s only that bad
If you tell yourself you’ll never get out of bed
Chaeri, please
You’re killing me
It’s only that bad, it’s only that bad
If you tell yourself you’ll never get out of bed
Forgеt
The way things could’ve been
Did I learn anything?
It was only that bad with you

Sеptember like a dream
But winter got so mean
The storm was underneath
If I could do it all again, I would’ve said:

Chaeri, please
You’re killing me
It’s only that bad, it’s only that bad
If you tell yourself you’ll never get out of bed
Chaeri, please
You’re killing me
It’s only that bad, it’s only that bad
If you tell yourself you’ll never get out of bed

3, 4, down to the floor
Lose control
Little more
3, 4, down to the floor
Lose control
Little more
Let it come alive
Let it grow
Better crucified
Than alone
Let it come alive
Let it grow
Better cut and dried
Than unknown1Embed
