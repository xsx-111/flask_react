Hysterical Us Lyrics
Down the road
Where the kids don't play alone
Or in your home
There's a fog
It's a shadow, a smoking gun
That something is wrong
Uh!

Hysterical us
Sucking in oxygen
How did we learn to breathe?
Are we alone?
Are we in love again?
What do you want from me?
Hysterical us
Checking the locks again
Remember when we could sleep?
Are we alone?
Are we in love again?
What do you want from me?

Play it cool
Play the man who won't play the fool
But they're playing you
'Til in the sky
Thirty-еight green blinding lights
Are here to takе you home
Ah!
Hysterical us
Sucking in oxygen
How did we learn to breathe?
Are we alone?
Are we in love again?
What do you want from me?
Hysterical us
Checking the locks again
Remember when we could sleep?
Are we alone?
Are we in love again?
What do you want from me?

You say I'm a winner
A fanfare rising in the breeze
I'd give it away
For a reason to be...
You say I'm a quitter
Well it's all I ever want to be
I'll throw it away for a glimmer
Of something I could try to believe

Hysterical us
Sucking in oxygen
How did we learn to breathe?
Are we alone?
Are we in love again?
What do you want from me?
Hysterical us
Checking the locks again
Remember when we could sleep?
Are we alone?
Are we in love again?
What do you want from me?
Hysterical us (I can't seem to shake it)
Sucking in oxygen (The feeling that I'm breaking)
How did we learn to breathe? (Just give me something I could believe)
Are we alone? (Are we alone? Can't seem to shake it)
Are we in love again? (The feeling that I'm breaking)
What do you want from me? (Just give me something I could believe)Embed
