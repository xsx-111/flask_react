You Lose! Lyrics
You, you say
You wanna go far away
I wanna know the place you crave
Is everything different or the same?

I'm running out of my time, a flower gone dry
Your lips touching mine won't do
Only what's left of my pride could lust for a lie
You aim, you attack, you lose

You say that you trust in me
And I say that I disagree

I'm out of my time, I'm lost in the crime
Your lips touching mine won't do
Only what's left of my pride could fall for a lie
You aim, you attack, you lose
You lose

You, you play
But there are no winners in the game
I wanna know the final stage
Where we go when the curtain fades
I'm running out of my time, a flowеr gone dry
Your lips touching mine won't do
Only what's left of my pridе could lust for a lie
You aim, you attack, you lose

And you say that you trust in me
And I say that I disagree
And you say that you trust in me
And I say that I disagree

I'm out of my time, I'm lost in the crime
Your lips touching mine won't do
Only what's left of my pride could fall for a lie
You aim, you attack, you lose
I'm running out of my time, I'm lost in the crime
Your lips touching mine won't do
Only what's left of my pride could fall for a lie
You aim, you attack, you lose

You lose
