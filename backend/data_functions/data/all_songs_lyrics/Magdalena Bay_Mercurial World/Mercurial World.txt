Mercurial World Lyrics
Hold me down to the Earth
When the storm's right in front of us
Tell me we'll make it work
You're as sure as the stars on top of us

'Cause of the way that you are
Steady and sound when I feel so crazy
The way that you are
How could I doubt the obvious?

We're spinning around, so let it rain down
Living in a mercurial world
You'll be around, always holding me down
Living in a mercurial world

Kiss me right where it hurts
Wash away all the falling dust
Worried I'll make you worse
But you're teaching me how to trust in us

‘Cause it’s the way that we are
Steady and strong when it's all so crazy
The way that we are
So how could I doubt the obvious?
We're spinning around, so let it rain down
Living in a mercurial world
You'll be around, always holding me down
Living in a mercurial world

Only, only you and me
Only, only you and me
Only, only you and me
Against the universe, baby
Only, only you and me
Only, only you and me
Only, only you and me
Against the universe

Living in a mercurial world, living in a mercurial world
(Only you and me, only, only you and me)
Living in a mercurial world, living in a mercurial world
Living in a mercurial world, living in a mercurial world
Living in a mercurial world, living in a mercurial worldEmbed
