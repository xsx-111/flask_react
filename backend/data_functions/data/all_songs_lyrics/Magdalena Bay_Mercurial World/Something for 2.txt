Something for 2 Lyrics
That girl knew all the ways to blow the whole world apart
Yeah, that was how she was
But two years of dealing with her and lately I've had enough
Of how I was, yeah, I was

Instinctively I know that I've
Been changing all my colors
I finally wrung out all the blues
Been sweeping all the corners of
My mind up to the ceiling but it wasn’t all I’d do for you

Don't let it fall, let it fall down
We could build something for two or burn it down
Instead of you keeping me out
We could build something for two or watch me drown

That girl knows all the ways to make you laugh 'til it hurts
Yeah, she does, yeah, she does
Well, that girl, believe it or not, is running all out of words
Is it enough? Is it enough?

Instinctively I know that I've
Been changing all my colors
I finally wrung out all the blues
Been sweeping all the corners of
My mind up to the ceiling but it wasn’t all I’d do for you
Don't let it fall, let it fall down
We could build something for two or burn it down
Instead of you keeping me out
We could build something for two or watch me drown


Don't let it fall, let it fall down
We could build something for two or burn it down
Instead of you keeping me out
We could build something for two or watch me
Watch me
Watch me

It wasn’t all I’d do
It wasn’t all I’d do
Sweeping all the corners of my mind
And we could build something for two
We could build something for two
So build it up or let it all fall down3Embed
