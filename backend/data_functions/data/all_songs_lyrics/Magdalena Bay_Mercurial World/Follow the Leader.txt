Follow the Leader Lyrics
Follow the leader, the rabbit
He needs it, he loves it
Follow the leader, the rabbit
He needs it, he loves it

Follow the leader, the rabbit (In the white trees tonight)
He needs it, he loves it (You wanna take a bite?)

You take the bait
Take the bait
Now will you try to stay awake?
Stay awake
Now do you see you took the bait?
Took the bait
Now will you try to stay awake?
Stay awake
Awake, awake

Follow the leader, the rabbit
You need it, you love it

Hе loves it when your eyеs go ’round and separate (In the white trees tonight)
He loves it when your eyes go
He loves it, he loves it
You take the bait, take the bait
Now will you try to stay awake?
Stay awake
Now do you see you took the bait?
Took the bait
Now will you try to stay awake?
Stay awake
Awake, awake


You take the bait, take the bait
Now will you try to stay awake?
Stay awake
Now do you see you took the bait?
Took the bait
Now will you try to stay awake?
Stay awake
Awake, awakeEmbed
