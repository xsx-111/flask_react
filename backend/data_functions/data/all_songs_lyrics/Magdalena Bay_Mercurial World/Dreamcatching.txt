Dreamcatching Lyrics
Picture Yoshino
With pink petals floating in the air
I wanna go there
Train window facing east
And you’re always next to me

And I’m next to you
I’m next to you

Meet me in the Swiss countryside
I saw a picture of it today
And I wanna go before I die
Big oceans blue, I want to see all the views
‘Cause there’s so much to do

And I’m next to you
I’m next to you

Ooh
I wanna see it with you
No stopping, too much to do
Dreamcatching
Always with you, you, you, you
Ooh
I wanna see it with you
No stopping, too much to do
Dreamcatching
Always with you, you, you, you
Picture everything
The world at our fingertips
And time for every trip
For all the things we wanna try before we die
‘Cause there’s so much to do

And I’m next to you
I’m next to you

Ooh
I wanna see it with you
No stopping, too much to do
Dreamcatching
Always with you, you, you, you
Ooh
I wanna see it with you
No stopping, too much to do
Dreamcatching
Always with you, you, you, you

Dreamcatching, dreamcatching
Dreamcatching, dreamcatching
Dreamcatching, dreamcatching
Dreamcatching, dreamcatching
Ooh
I wanna see it with you
No stopping, too much to do
Dreamcatching
Always with you, you, you, you
Too much to do
Ooh (Time with you stretches into the horizon)
I wanna see it with you (Breaks in two, let it bend and see that anything could happen)
No stopping, too much to do (What to do?)
(Time with you stretches into the horizon)
Dreamcatching
Always with you, you, you, you (Breaks in two, let it bend and see that anything could happen)

Dreamcatching, dreamcatching
Dreamcatching, dreamcatchingEmbed
