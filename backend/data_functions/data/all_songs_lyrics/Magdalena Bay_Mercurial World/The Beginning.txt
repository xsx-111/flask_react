The Beginning Lyrics
He was a lonely cynic
No hero nor a villain inside
Until he had a vision
She had golden eyes and spoke her mind:

"Now easy livin', it sets you free"
You’ll rediscover simplicity"
His cynicism gave way to be
Raindrops in every color

So if you feel low
Sit back, enjoy the show
Like a kaleidoscope
In technicolor tonight
So if you feel low
Sit back, enjoy the show
Like a kaleidoscope
In technicolor tonight
In technicolor tonight
In technicolor tonight

So if you think you’re finished
Go back to the beginning and find
That everybody needs a little help
From time to time
Just look inside
Now easy livin', it sets you free
You’ll rediscover simplicity
‘Cause cynicism gives way to be
Raindrops in every color

So if you feel low
Sit back, enjoy the show
Like a kaleidoscope
In technicolor tonight
So if you feel low
Sit back, enjoy the show
Like a kaleidoscope
In technicolor tonight

Matt, go back to sleep
I think I’ve finally got it all figured out
Like a butterfly floating in amber
We’ve made this moment...
Eternal


So if you feel low
Sit back, enjoy the show
Like a kaleidoscope
In technicolor tonight
So if you feel low
Sit back, enjoy the show
Like a kaleidoscope
In technicolor tonight
In technicolor tonight
In technicolor tonight
Matt, Matt
