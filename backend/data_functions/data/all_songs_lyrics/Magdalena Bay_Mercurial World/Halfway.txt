Halfway Lyrics
No matter where you start or where you end
You are in between the where and when
You are in the middle of the loop
Do you feel half empty or half full?
Is everything beautiful or dull?
Flip a circle and the middle stays the same

Halfway
We’re halfway home
Slow down
The day’s ’bouta be gone
The sun goes
He sleeps until dawn
Slow down
The day is gone
