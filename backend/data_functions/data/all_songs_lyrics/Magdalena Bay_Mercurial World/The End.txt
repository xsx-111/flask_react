The End Lyrics
Matt! Matt! Wake up!
I was thinking about how there's no true end to anything
Everything comes from and goes to the same place:
Nowhere!
So, if the beginning is the end, and the end is the beginning, then what's the end anyway?
Does that help you sleep better?
Like the rosy haze of an apocalypse sky, or the comfort inside of a lie?Embed
