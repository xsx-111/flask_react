Seven Times Lyrics
Yeah, that's a good intro

Mm, you didn't pay your rent
So I guess you'll be leaving
You made promises that you won't be keeping
Oh, you can't spend my love, I'm living for free now
What used to be means nothing to me now

All night, all day, all night and day
I cry and pray, I cry and pray
All night and day, all night and day
All night, all day, I cry and pray
I'll cry and pray, all night, all day
(All night, all day)

You've gotta hold your heart but I don't think you're ready
Could forgive, forget, I know I'd regret it
Oh, so don't hold your breath because I'm easy breathing
I've gotta find my friends, I guess I'll be leaving, oh

All night, all day, all night and day
I cry and pray, I cry and pray
All night and day, all night and day
All night, all day, I cry and pray
I'll cry and pray, all night, all day
All night, all day
You know it when you know that it's wrong (Know that it's wrong)
It's hard to admit it, so you sing along
Better be strong (Oh)
When you feel like you're losing your mind (Losing your mind)
You better read between the lines seven times

All night, all day, all night and day
I cry and pray, all night, all day
All night, all day, all night and day
I cry and pray, I cry and pray
All night and day, all night and day
All night, all day, I cry and pray
I'll cry and pray, all night, all day
(All night, all day)
All night, all day, all night and day
I cry and pray, all night, all day
All night and day, I cry and pray
All night, all day, all night and day (All day)
I cry and pray, all night, all day
(I cry and cry, all night and day)
All night, all day, all night and day
I cry and pray, all night, all day
All night and day, I cry and pray
All night, all day, all night and day
I cry and pray, all night, all day
All night and day, I cry and pray
Seven, seven times2Embed
