Sour Flower Lyrics
No more looking out for someone else but me
Fighting an old war
Reaching out for something out of reach
Keeping my eyes closed
So I never miss another beat
Running my own show
You can find me dancing on my own
As hard as it may be

I'm done settling for so much less than I knew I deserved
Some better kind of love, you wasted time searching for Heaven
Must have flown a hundred thousand miles to get back to Brixton
If you ever need me, I’ll be home, home
If you need me, I'll be home

When I'm hot, when I’m blue
I'm not crying over you
When I cry, now I'm free
Sour flower, it's on me
You're all I, all I, all I need

I have been waiting for the fog to drift away
Letting the light in, now I'm getting stronger every day
Keeping my heart clean
Working out just how to find my way
But I'm still learning
Now I'm home, I know I’m gonna stay
Hard as it may be
When I’m hot, when I'm blue
I’m not crying over you
When I cry, it's 'cause I'm free
Sour flower, it’s on me
All I, all I, all I need
When I'm hot, when I'm blue
I'm not crying over you
When I cry, now I'm free
Sour flower, it's on me
All I, all I, all I need
When I'm hot, when I'm blue
I'm not crying over you
When I cry, now I'm free
Sour flower, it's on me
All I, all I need


(Ayy)
Ah, I lost it! 
That's it, it's done2Embed
