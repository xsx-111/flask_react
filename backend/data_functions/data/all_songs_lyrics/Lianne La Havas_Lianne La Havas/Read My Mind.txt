Read My Mind Lyrics
So right, I could make a baby tonight
Throw my life away, oh
I'll die another day
Feels like I've got nothing to hide
It's serendipity, I noticed you noticed me
Those eyes, caught by surprise
If I look again, oh, what's gonna happen then?

Sweet joy when a girl meets a boy
Happened naturally, mm, better believe, mm
Could you possibly be any closer to me, boy?
Not a thing you can do 'cause I'm comin' for you

Yes, it's time (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Read my mind (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Seek and you will find (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Oh my, it's love, nothing more (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
What you waiting for? (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Oh, no, it's time, mm

Oh, no, you're everywhere that I go
In my head again, oh, stuck in my head again
Full force, nature taking her course
No need for hide-and-seek
I'll let you find me
Lovin' light, personified
I'm so into him, oh
Oh, I hope God is listening
The pure joy when a girl meets a boy
Natural chemistry, oh, better believe
Could you possibly be any closer to me, boy?
Not a thing you can do 'cause I'm comin' for you

Yes, it's time (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Read my mind (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Seek and you will find (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Oh my, it's love, nothing more (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
What you waiting for? (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
I'm yours, oh, boy (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Read my mind (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Seek and you will find (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Oh my, it's love, nothing more (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
What you waiting for? (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
(What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Mm-mm (What you waiting, what you waiting for?)

Could you possibly be any closer to me, boy?
Not a thing you can do 'cause I'm comin' for you, boy
(What you waiting, what you waiting for? What you waiting for?)
(What you waiting, what you waiting for? What you waiting for?)
(What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Could you possibly be any closer to me, boy?
Not a thing you can do, I'm comin' for you, boy4Embed
