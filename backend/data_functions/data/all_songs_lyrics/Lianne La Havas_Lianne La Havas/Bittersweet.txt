Bittersweet Lyrics
Oh

Please stop asking, "Do you still love me?"
Don't have much to say, let's speak in the morning
Please don't do this, I'm too far away
Don't know what to tell you, babe

No more hangin' around, oh
No more hangin' around, oh
Now my sun's goin' down, oh
Tellin' me something isn't right, something isn't right, oh
Bittersweet summer rain
I'm born again
All my broken pieces
Bittersweet summer rain
I'm born again, oh
No more hangin' around, oh
No hangin' around, oh
Oh, my sun's goin' down, oh
Tellin' me something isn't right, oh
I slept all Friday and he couldn't get through
If we're good tomorrow, does that make it true?
Not completely, we're pickin' that fight every day
This shit's goin' nowhere, baby
Bittersweet summer rain
I'm born again
All my broken pieces
Bittersweet summer rain
I'm born again, oh
No more hangin' around, oh
No hangin' around, oh
Oh, my sun goin' down, oh
Tellin' me something isn't right, oh, oh, oh

Bittersweet summer rain
I'm born again, mmm14Embed
