Courage Lyrics
Mm, lost and overcome by the memory, mm
Of everything we were, but will never be
It's making me terribly lonely

So lonely now
Love is the only way down

Courage, save me somehow
This is the only way out

I can't resist your spell
I just lose my head, mm, I lose my head
Every time we speak
So I sing instead
All of these melodies
Maybe I'll never learn
Maybe it's not my turn
Could it be that I am only dreaming
Of a place that I wanna be?
Of a face that I longed to see?
With a heart that belongs only to me?
And not to be so lonely now
Love is the only way down

Courage, save me somehow
This is the only way out
So lonely now
Love is the only way down
Courage, save me somehow
This is the only way outEmbed
