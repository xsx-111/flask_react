Green Papaya Lyrics
My face turns to gold, hoping to find my way home
This place I don't know, no yellow brick road to follow
This river of doubt, help me to swim my way out
I'm greedy with love, but my hunger to give is strong enough

Mm, take me home, let's make real love, real love
Take me home, let's make real love, real love
Take me home, let's make real love, real love
Take me out of the blue

Our hearts overgrown, longing for peace of our own
Found Heaven in you, promise to be pure and true
Still mountains to climb, we will survive, still got time
My partner-in-crime, hoping you'll love me 'til we die

Take me home, let's make real love, real love
Take me home, let's make real love, real love
Take me home, let's make real love, real love
Take me out of the blue

My face turns to gold, hoping to find my way home
This place I don't know, no yellow brick road to follow
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah
Mm, take me home, let's make real love, real love
Take me home, let's make real love, real love
Take me home, let's make real love, real love
Take home, let's make real love, real love, real love
(Take me home, let's make real love, real love)
Mm, home
Take me out of the blueEmbed
