Weird Fishes Lyrics
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantom (Yeah)
I follow to the edge (Yeah)
Of the Earth (Yeah)
And I fall off
Oh, yeah, everybody leaves (Yeah)
If they get the chance (Yeah)
And this (Yeah), this is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
Yeah, I'll hit the bottom
The bottom and escape, escape
Yeah, hit the bottom
The bottom and escape, escape
Yeah, hit the bottom
The bottom and escape, escape
I'll hit the bottom and escape5Embed
