Babe in Arms LyricsHere I sit, with a babe in arms
And another one here within
And where's my man?
Ah don't you know: he's drinkin', carousin', and livin' a life of sin
Once he courted me so fine
Oh why did I give in?
And where's he now?
Ah don't you know: he's drinkin', carousin', and livin' a life of sin
And were it not for my own breast
My baby'd die for sure
And where's my man?
Ah don't you know: he's drinkin', carousin', and livin' a life so poor
And were it not for this wee baby
Well, you know what I'd do
Ooh, to my fine man
Ah, don't you know: I'd shoot him and put an end to his life of sin
And here I sit, with a babe in arms
And another one here within
And where's my man?
Ah don't you know: he's drinkin', carousin', and livin' a life of sinEmbed
