Eyes of Amber LyricsEyes of blue
Or eyes of green
Eyes of amber
Eyes of starlight
Have come again as they have
Come before
Heart of fire light
Heart of the flowers of the
Jungle
Heart of snow
You come again and you are
Midnight wind
With hands of
Moon beams
And clouds
And call me
"Come"
To you
And though I never know you
Wistful lover
Until you're gone
You're here to teach me
How to love
A dream of loving love
Breath of jasmine
Breast of silk
Breast of music
The desert sands
That take my tears
Are of your magic too
Eyes of blue
Or eyes of onyx
Eyes of amber
Eyes of starlight
You come again as you have
Come beforeEmbed
