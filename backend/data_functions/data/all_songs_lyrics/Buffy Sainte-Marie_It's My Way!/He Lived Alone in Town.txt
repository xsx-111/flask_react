He Lived Alone in Town LyricsHe lived alone in town
His friends were many and true
He drank and took the easy love
Of street girls that he knew
And he met a girl one day
Said "come home with me tonight"
"Oh no!" she cried "I never will."
And she left him there alone
And the days went by, and days
Went by and they did long
For each other every hour
But still she'd not be bound
"In the places of young men
I never will be found
But think you not that I don't love
For my heart is ripe and full"
"How cold you are!" he said
"I guess you must not care
For me. But tell me
Where it is you'd go
For I'd take you anywhere"
"Then come to a forest green
Where I may love you free
Beyond the confines of your walls
And beyond the sweetest words"
"And beyond the mountains high
Beyond the fields of shame
And beyond the prettiest wedding ring
For I'd never take your name"
"And wander with me now
Or wander all forlorn
But know I love you, tearful one
Much more than I can show"
He could not understand
He thought she could not care
"Oh, take me far away," she'd cried
And he could not hear her prayer
And he wandered off alone
To never know her dream
And she still dwells within the forest
Longing for his love
"So, wander with me now
Or wander off alone
But know I love you, tearful one
Much more than I can show"Embed
