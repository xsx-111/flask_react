Cripple Creek Lyrics
Hey, I got a girl at the head of the creek
And I'm goin' up to see her about two times a week
Kiss her on the mouth, sweet as any wine
Wrap herself around me like a sweet potato vine

I'm goin' up Cripple Creek, goin' on a run
Goin' up Cripple Creek to have a little fun
Goin' up Cripple Creek, goin' in a whirl
Goin' up Cripple Creek to see my little girl

Now the girls up at Cripple Creek about half-grown
Jump on a boy like a dog on a bone
Roll my britches up to my knees
Wade ol' Cripple Creek whenever I please

I'm goin' up Cripple Creek, goin' on a run
Goin' up Cripple Creek to have a little fun
Goin' up Cripple Creek, goin' in a whirl
Goin' up Cripple Creek to see my little girl

Now, Cripple Creek's wide and Cripple Creek's deep
I'll wade old Cripple Creek before I sleep
Hills are steep and the roads are muddy
And I'm so dizzy that I can't stand steady
I'm goin' up Cripple Creek, goin' on a run
Goin' up Cripple Creek to have a little fun
Goin' up Cripple Creek, goin' in a whirl
Goin' up Cripple Creek to see my little girlEmbed
