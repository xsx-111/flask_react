Citizen Erased Lyrics
Break me in
Teach us to cheat
And to lie, and cover up
What shouldn't be shared
And the truth's unwinding
Scraping away at my mind
Please stop asking me to describe

For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open-minded
I'm sure I used to be so free

Self-expressed
Exhausting for all to see and to be
What you want and what you need
And the truth's unwinding
Scraping away at my mind
Please stop asking me to describe

For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open-minded
I'm sure I used to be so free
For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open-minded
I'm sure I used to be so free

Wash me away
Clean your body of me
Erase all the memories
They'll only bring us pain
And I've seen all I'll ever need25Embed
