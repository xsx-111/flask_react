Megalomania Lyrics
Paradise comes at a price
That I am not prepared to pay
What were we built for?
Could someone tell me please?
The good news is she can't have babies
And won't accept gifts from me
What are they for?
They'll just grow up
And break the laws you've loved

Take off your disguise
I know that underneath it's me
Who are you?
Ooh

Useless device, it won't suffice
I want a new game to play
When I am gone, it won't be long
Before I disturb you in the dark
And paradise comes at a price
That I am not prepared to pay
What were we built for?
Will someone tell me please?
Take off your disguise
I know that underneath it's me
