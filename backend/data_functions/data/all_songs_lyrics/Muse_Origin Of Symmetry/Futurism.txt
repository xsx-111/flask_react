Futurism Lyrics
Ignorance pulls
Apostasy and apathy still rules
Yeah you know it's cool
Just suck and see
A future turns us into silent gods
And I won't miss you at all

Grounded, boxed in
Like the evil in your veins
Grounded, boxed in
I am stuck with you

Fate can't decide
Alignment of the planets in your hands
Come on crush our plans
Just suck and see
A future that won't let you disagree
And I won't miss you at all

Grounded, boxed in
Like the evil in your veins
Grounded, boxed in
I am stuck with you
Feel it, hear it, apathy you are
See it, be it, you'll see!1Embed
