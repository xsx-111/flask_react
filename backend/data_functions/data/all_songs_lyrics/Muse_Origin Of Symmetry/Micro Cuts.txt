Micro Cuts Lyrics
Hands are red with your blame
Megaphone screaming my name
Whimpers someone I should've loved
Souls weeping above

I've seen what you’re doing to me
Destroying puppet strings to our souls

Micro waves me insane
A blade cuts in your brain
Sounds like forks on a plate
Blackboard scratched with hate

I've seen what you’re doing to me
Destroying puppet strings to our souls
