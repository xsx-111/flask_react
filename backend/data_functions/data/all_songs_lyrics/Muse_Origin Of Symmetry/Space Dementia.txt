Space Dementia Lyrics
H8 is the one for me
It gives me all I need
And helps me coexist
With the chill

You make me sick
Because I adore you so
I love all the dirty tricks
And twisted games you play
On me

Space dementia in your eyes and
Peace will arise
And tear us apart
And make us meaningless again

You'll make us wanna die
I'd cut your name in my heart
We'll destroy this world for you
I know you want me to
Feel your pain
Space dementia in your eyes and
Peace will arise
And tear us apart
And make us meaningless again16Embed
