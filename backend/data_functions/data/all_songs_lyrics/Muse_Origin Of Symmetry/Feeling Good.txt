Feeling Good Lyrics
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Reeds drifting on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom in the trees, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonflies out in the Sun
You know what I mean, don't you know?
Butterflies are all having fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace
When the day is done
And this old World is a new World and a bold World
For me

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Yeah, freedom is mine and you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
Butterflies, ooh
Oh, ooh ...
Ooooh...freer than you...ooooh...
