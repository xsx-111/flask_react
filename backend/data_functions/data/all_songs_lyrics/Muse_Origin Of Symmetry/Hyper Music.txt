Hyper Music Lyrics

Your golden lies feed my role
In this forgotten space race under my control

Who's returned from the dead?
Who remains?
(Just to spit it in your face)

You know that I don't want you and I never did
I don't want you and I never will

You wanted more than I was worth
And you think I was scared, yeah
And you needed proof

Who really cares anymore?
Who restrains?
(Just to spit it in your face)

You know that I don't love you and I never did
I don't want you and I never will5Embed
