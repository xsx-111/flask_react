Halleluhwah Lyrics
Did anybody see the snowman standing on winter road
With broken guitar in his hand, onion peeling sleepy eye?
It's my recording station, man but I record in his head
Knowing that to big mouth, oh, ice can flow away, one knows

Moon shadow coming down
While it's all a stormy, stormy night
Oh, the sound all above
Spinning me, hold me tight

My powers strike me out
Did I slip this thing on their life?
And my god buying out
Oh, it gets me in star light

Searching for my blood flow, yes I am
Searching for my blood flow, yes I am
Searching for my blood flow, yes I am
Searching for my blood flow, yes I am

Did you see the day? Every fever I make my search in
We can find another stream, change its kind, fly away


Oh, they're all alone, man, like me
Oh, she asked me, Thursday, for her name
So she was to go where I was singing
"Mushroom Head", "Oh Yeah", "Paperhouse"
I wonder what I should do
It's a game after this

Moon shadow coming down
While it's all a stormy, stormy night
Oh, the sound all above
Spinning me, but hold me tight

Shoot all the proof and lust and shout and it's all just you sow
Shoot all the proof and lust and shout and it's all just you sow
Shoot all the proof and lust and shout and it's all just you sow
Shoot all the proof and lust and shout and it's all just you sow
Searching for my blood flow
Searching for my blood flow, Hallelalalaluhwah
Searching for my blood flow, Hallelalalaluhwah
Searching for my blood flow, Hallelalalaluhwah
Searching for my blood flow, Hallelalalaluhwah
Halalalalalalalalalalalaluwah
Halalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaluwah
Halalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaluwah
Halalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaluwah


And it goes like...
And she said...
Got my fever, what do I do?
Got my fever, what do I do?
Got your soles into your shoes
Got my fever, what do I do?
Got my fever, what do I do?
