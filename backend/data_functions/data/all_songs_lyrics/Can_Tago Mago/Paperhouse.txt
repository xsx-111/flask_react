Paperhouse Lyrics
Take a light shining on
The land off the wall
Up and down, think of anything
What you feel is all gone
You can make everything
What you want with your head
You’re OK and be aware
Everywhere with your mind

Two times, goodbye love
You’re sorting out your room
Too many savage songs
Laugh at him today
Playing everything
You and your mind
The flying paperhouse
Way back on the sky

You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
You just can't give back no more, you just can't give back no more
And you don't think anything
Makes you feel so bad
You can make everything
What you want with your head
And you don't think anything
Makes you feel so great
You can make everything
What you want with your head

Flying paperhouse
Comes down from the sky
Every day my paperhouse
Reaches out, comes in
Every day my paperhouse
Coming in, reaching out
Every day my paperhouse
Coming in, reaching out6Embed
