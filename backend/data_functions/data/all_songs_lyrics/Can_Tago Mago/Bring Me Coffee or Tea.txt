Bring Me Coffee or Tea Lyrics
You just smile at me
You're just on my knee
Bring me coffee or tea
Call me "pretty little bee"

Whisper in my ear and
You're still my parent's friend
Throw me out of my bag
You ask me "Are you dead?"

I feel pretty in the chimney, I feel
I feel pretty in the chimney, I feel
I feel pretty in the chimney, I feel

You just smile at me
You're just on my knee
Bring me coffee or tea
Call me "pretty little bee"

Whisper in my ear and
You're still my parent's friend
Throw me out of my bag
You ask me "Are you dead?
Dead, dead?"
You just smile at me
You're just on my knee

And I feel
I feel pretty in the chimney, I feel
I feel pretty in the chimney, I feel
I feel pretty in the chimney, yes, I'm again
I feel pretty in the chimney, yes, I'm again
I feel pretty in the chimney, yes, I'm again
Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again
Oh!
Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again
Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again
Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again
Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again
Yes, I'm again
Yes, I'm again2Embed
