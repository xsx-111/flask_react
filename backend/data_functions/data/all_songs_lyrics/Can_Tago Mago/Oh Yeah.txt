Oh Yeah Lyrics
(Explosion)

You don't need to go, you show
On the bed with a lie
Like a floating cloud, every time
That visits a lie
Thus we spend the time in time
In a trash box for your fire
Think I'll take it if you want to
On your time, you're so sad
As your silver hair hat save that
For you got to better not there
I see your own cheeks, saves that
It's a time you're my last sign
Here they come to sue the passing
As you do too everyday
Still you point at them and then
Seems like I'm asleep

As your silver hair save that
For you got to better not there
I see your own cheeks, saves that
It's a time you're my lasting sign
Here they come to sue the passing
As you do too everyday
Still you point at them and then
Seems like I'm asleep
一人でそこに座ってる
頭のイカレた奴
虹の上から小便
我らがヒモと呼ぶ
LSDの街から
離れ餓鬼を怖れ
朝が未だ来ないのを
幸いなことに4Embed
