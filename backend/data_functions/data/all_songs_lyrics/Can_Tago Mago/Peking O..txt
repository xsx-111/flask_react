Peking O. Lyrics
Driving my way to
Driving my way back to yesterday
Driving my way back to yesterday
The night never sleeps
Driving my way back to yesterday
Driving my way back to yesterday
Driving my way
Driving my way back to yesterday
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

Says I carry a heart
Momma gonna eat, Momma eat
Papa gonna eat, Momma gonna eat, Papa gonna eat
Momma gonna, Papa gonna, Momma gonna, Papa gonna
Momma gonna, Papa gonna, Momma gonna, Papa gonna
Momma gonna, Papa gonna, Momma gonna, Papa gonna

Momma gonna eat, Papa gonna eat
Momma gonna eat, Papa gonna eat
Momma gonna eat, Papa gonna eat
Momma gonna eat, Papa gonna eat
Momma gonna eat, Papa gonna eat
Momma gonna eat, Papa gonna eat
Momma gonna eat
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go through the window
Let's just go, let's just go, let's just go, let's just go

Together it's a warning
All aboard it's the truth!
All aboard the train we go!
All aboard the train we go!
All aboard the train we go!
So, come on!

All aboard the train we go!
All aboard the train we go!
Got to get a party a party party party
Got to get a party a party party party
Got to get a party a party party partyEmbed
