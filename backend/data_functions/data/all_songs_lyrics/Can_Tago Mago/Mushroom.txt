Mushroom Lyrics
When I saw mushroom head
When I saw mushroom head
When I saw mushroom head
I was born and I was dead
I was born and I was dead
When I saw mushroom head
When I saw mushroom head
When I saw mushroom head
I was born and I was dead
I was born and I was dead
I'm gonna give my despair
I'm gonna give my despair
I'm gonna give my despair

When I saw skies are red
When I saw skies are red
When I saw skies are red
I was born and I was-
I was born and I was dead
I was born and I was dead
I was born and I was dead
I was born and I was dead
I was born and I was dead
I was born and I was dead
When I saw mushroom head
When I saw mushroom head
When I saw mushroom head
When I saw mushroom head
I was born, I was dead
I was born, I was dead
I'm gonna give my despair
I'm gonna give my despair
I'm gonna give my despair
I'm gonna give my despair

When I saw mushroom head
When I saw mushroom head
When I saw mushroom head
I was born and I was dead
I was born and I was dead
I was born and I was dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, deadEmbed
