Hail to Whatever You Found in the Sunlight That Surrounds You Lyrics
Hail to those who have come
From the sunlight that surrounds you
Pray for those who have gone
From the sunlight that surrounds you
Hail to those who have come
From the sunlight that surrounds you
Pray for those who have gone
From the sunlight that surrounds you
Pretend all the good things are for you

Hail to those who have come
From the sunlight that surrounds you
Hail to whatever you found
In the sunlight that surrounds you

Pretend all the good things are for you
Pretend all the good things are for me, too
And the weather changes
Not halfway between your house and mine

Pretend all the good things are for you
Pretend all the good things are for me, too
And the weather changes
Not halfway between your house and mine
And all of the good things are for me
And all of the good things are for you, too
And the weather changes
Not halfway between your house and mineEmbed
