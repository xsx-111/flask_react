So Long Lyrics
Watch me fly away
Through the night sky, yeah
Now that all you touched has finally turned gray
And roads can't hold us down
Winds will move us around
With no need to return to this gray town

Wanna bet? I can tell
You've been in bed for too long
So let's just say "So long"

And I watched you at the cove
You read on rocks below
And I turned home without so much as "hello"

Wanna know where I go?
I've been away for too long
And it's hard to leave when I haven't seen
You in so long

And if we had just held out for tomorrow
We might have seen
What seemed so far away
We didn't even bother to stay
There it goes, I can tell
You're gonna keep your eyes to the ground
Waiting for something to finally come around
Tell you what you knew that you weren't wrong
And it's finally time for soâ€“

When dad moved out to a frozen land
The TV was jumping, it didn't feel right, and
The cards, they came with pictures of frozen lights
And giant frozen sculptures
So big right beside him, carved out of snow
The clouds fooled us into seeing snow
As far as we could see
It was summer and the sun came up
And never went down for two whole weeksEmbed
