A Better Son/Daughter Lyrics
Sometimes in the morning
I am petrified and can't move
Awake, but cannot open my eyes
And the weight is crushing down
On my lungs, I know I can't breathe
And hope someone will save me this time
And your mother's still calling you, insane and high
Swearing it's different this time
And you tell her to give in
To the demons that possess her
And that God never blessed her insides
Then you hang up the phone
And feel badly for upsetting things
Crawl back into bed to dream of a time
When your heart was open wide
And you loved things just because
Like the sick and the dying

And sometimes when you're on
You're really fucking on
And your friends, they sing along and they love you
But the lows are so extreme
That the good seems fucking cheap
And it teases you for weeks in its absence
But you'll fight and you'll make it through
You'll fake it if you have to
And you'll show up for work with a smile
And you'll be better and you'll be smarter
And more grown up and a better daughter
Or son, and a real good friend
And you'll be awake, you'll be alert
You'll be positive though it hurts
And you'll laugh and embrace all your friends
You'll be a real good listener
You'll be honest, you'll be brave
You'll be handsome and you'll be beautiful
You'll be happy
Your ship may be coming in
You're weak, but not giving in
To the cries and the wails of the valley below
And your ship may be coming in
You're weak, but not giving in
And you'll fight it, you'll go out fighting all of them15Embed
