Spectacular Views Lyrics
In steep cliffs, rocks all piled up
Mysteries of your passing luck
And ages pass, shells and bits of bone
Forming new limestone
To give things their turn

There are no bad words
For the coast today

You never knew why you felt so good
In the strangest of places
Like in waiting rooms
Or long lines that made you late
Or mall parking lots on holidays

There are no bad words
For the coast today
When we hold our breath
Until nothing's left
It all starts to fade

See the stars
From where the birds make their homes
Staring back at us
Indifferent, but distanced perfectly
Projected endlessly
It's so fuckin' beautiful
There are no bad words
For the coast today
Then you ask
"What's a palisade?"
And if we're too late
For happiness

Then we move on out to the palisades
Where the sea pushes on the sand
Where the views are cheap and spectacular
They're spectacular
If you would just take my hand

My dad was nice and seemed sorry for not bein' around
He left work early and took me to a skating rink
Where all of the kids in the world could have been
I was scared and tall with skates on and my favorite jeans
And there was a boy who wanted to skate with me
And he held my hand
And we went around
More times than I counted
By a mural of an Arctic scene
I was lookin' at my feet because
It was perfect and the air was clean
And my dad was there, it was summer's last eve
And that's how I choose to remember itEmbed
