The Execution of All Things Lyrics
Soldiers, come quickly
I feel the earth beneath my feet
I'm feeling badly, it's not an attempt at decency
And if you're well off, well, then I'm happy some for you
But I'd rather not celebrate my defeat
And humiliation here with you

Someone, come quickly
This place was built for moving out
Leave behind buildings, the city planners got mapped out
Bring with you history and make your hard earned feast
Then we'll go to Omaha to work and exploit
The booming music scene
And humility

And we've been talking all night

Oh god, come quickly
The execution of all things
Let's start with the bears and the air
And mountains, rivers and streams
Then we'll murder what matters to you
And move on to your neighbors and kids
Crush all hopes of happiness with disease
'Cause of what you did
And lastly you're all alone with nothing left but sleep
But sleep never comes to you
It's the guilt and forever wakefulness of the weak
It's just you and me

The execution of all things
The execution of all things
The execution of all thingsEmbed
