Capturing Moods Lyrics
Moods don't command you
If you don't know what you're going through
There's love for you
Up where the population grows

There's friendly people in cities too
Just ask them where they are going to
There's life and work
Up where the clouds meet the snow

And I don't mind waiting

I'm always one step ahead of you
If you don't know what you're going through
There's laughs and fun
Up where the conversation flows

And I don't mind waiting
If it takes a long, long time
And I don't mind braving
The coldest winter of our time
And I don't mind racing through our goodbyes
This is your last line of defense
You could sell your baseball cards
Just to pay your rent, yeah

I don't mind waiting
If it takes a long, long time
And I don't mind wasting
The best years of our lives
And I don't mind racing through our goodbyesEmbed
