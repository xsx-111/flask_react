My Slumbering Heart Lyrics
In my dreams, I see myself hitting a baseball
In a green field somewhere near a freeway
I'm all tan and smiling and running from third base
And it's hot and the kids keep on playing the driving game
And they're singing the same goddamn refrain
And the sky is a bluish grey

And it's become just like a chemical stress
Tracing the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
I've barely been gone

In my dreams, I see you at the foot of some mountains
And we're taking some pictures or something
And we'd better hurry up
And it's late and the sun keeps on shooting through pine trees
And the grass stains are wet on your new jeans
And we'd better hurry up

And I've become just like a terrible mess
Searching the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
The crowds keep me coming back, cheering
In my dreams, I see you asleep on a twin bed
The covers pulled up over your head
Am I asleep or awake?
And it's morning and the captain is playing the radio
And he's just put the paint on his new boat
Am I asleep or awake?

And it just feels good when you're waking up
And it just feels good when you're next to me
And it just feels good when you're coming home
And it just feels good when it's waking up
(My slumbering heart)

And I've become just like a chemical stress
Tracing the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
I've barely been gone

And I'm not a failure, I swear
I wish you could see it from over there
I've got a lot over here without you
I've barely been gone
Gone, dreaming

My mom, she cried about money and time
And how she felt older
And I didn't understand much
She left, I stayed
My dad played in the bar
And I wondered if I looked like him
He was small even with boots on
He looked like an Eskimo
And we were in Alaska
In the airport, I had seen or
Imagined a mural of an Arctic scene
With seals and people seemed nicer than me
Where they smoked and talked about the disappearing ground1Embed
