Three Hopeful Thoughts Lyrics
All this talk of your sweet girlfriend
Is starting to pay off
And the charms that you got from travel
Are starting to wear off

And I hope that you smile tonight
Watching the last of your friends arrive
You'll smile and shake their hands

And the hero that you hoped you'd be
Never seemed to show up
And if I can keep on talking
There won't be time to give up

And I hope that I drive tonight
Into the last of the great sunrises
I'll smile and wave my hand
Goodbye

If things don't work out
Quite the way you planned
It's almost half past two
And I've begun to hate the way
You smile, so slow
And I hope that you close your eyes
Block out the pain of a thousand lives
I hope that you die tonight
Just close your eyes, there goes the light
Smile, I'll brave it while you wave your hand
Goodbye1Embed
