With Arms Outstretched Lyrics
It's sixteen miles to the promised land
And I promise you I'm doing the best I can
Now don't fool yourself in thinking you're more than a man
'Cause you'll probably end up dead
I visit these mountains with frequency
And I stand here with my arms up

Now some days, they last longer than others
But this day by the lake went too fast
And if you want me, you better speak up, I won't wait
So you better move fast

Don't fool yourself in thinking you're more than you are
With your arms outstretched to me
Now it's sixteen miles to the promised land
And I promise you I'm doing the best I can

Now some days, they last longer than others
But this day by the lake went too fast
And if you want me, you better speak up, I won't wait
So you better move fast
And some days, they last longer than others
But this day by the lake went too fast
And if you want me, you better speak up, I won't wait
So you better move fastEmbed
