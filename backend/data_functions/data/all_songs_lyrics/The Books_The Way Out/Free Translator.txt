Free Translator LyricsAnd I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
The hold-out boy and the weather girl
Know the wind moves in a patient way
Like a two-decade day
The man in the mouth of a drain
Laughing and chewing erasers
Like a black dog in the snow
Write in relief and sleep again
And you can't believe your eyes
And you can't find your pen
And the man in the hole
Is your new friend's friend
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
Symmetrical foot in your mouth
And your high speed legs
Your kneejerk's a mark of distinction
It's an elevator put-on
Count your dollar, only one
And count it again
One one one
You can't count it when your dead, no
You keep a pure nose
Write in relief and sleep again
And you get in the hole
With your new friend's friend
And he can't believe his eyes
And he can't find his pen
And the meteorological man
With a whirl-wind girl
And a mote in the sun
And a squid in a bag
And a raccoon hat
And a talking plant
And a careful goat
In a sewer system shaft
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I see
And I seeEmbed
