I Am Who I Am LyricsNuttiness
Oh you think you're gonna do something different than what I'm doing right now
Just do what I'm doing
I don't know what it is, if you like what we're doing right now
Just having a nice pleasant conversation with your friends
Keep in mind that whatever you're doing
Whatever it was
What you're doing
You never enjoy what you're doing
Whatever you do. This is a wonderful phrase by Gandhi

I am who I am, and what I am, and I will be what I will be. OK?
Present tense: I am who I am. Not was, but I am
Can you imagine that? I am who I am
It would have been 
I am who I am
I will be who I am and what I am
In other words, I'm going to do it
I am who I am
I am what I am
I will be who I am
What I am I will be
Not going to be. Not was
I am who I am!
I am what I am!
I will be what I will be!
You are who you are and who you are
Who you are!
Who does he think he is?Embed
