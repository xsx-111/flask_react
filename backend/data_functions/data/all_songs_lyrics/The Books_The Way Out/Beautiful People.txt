Beautiful People LyricsBehold the finite set of thirteen convex figures
Irrational sine versus tangent 45
And we genuflect before pure abstraction
1.05946, twelth root of two, amen

To whom we venerate seven pieces
Endlessly manifold, self-contained, replete
With all respect, we beseech the books of figures
Make us your analog, to begin againEmbed
