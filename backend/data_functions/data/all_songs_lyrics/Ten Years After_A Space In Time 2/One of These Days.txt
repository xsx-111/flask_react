One of These Days LyricsOne of these days, Boy
Going to see my baby
Going to see my baby
Coming down the road
She'll have my pardon
Pardon in her apron, oh Lord
Going to see the governor
Say "Release my man"
Coming down the road, boy
She's coming down the road
Red dress on, yeah
Got her red dress on
Coming down the road, boy
She's coming down the road
Bags down low
She's got her bags down low
One of these days, Boy
Going to see my woman
She'll have my children
Children on her knee
I'll run up to my woman
And hold her in my arms
Tears in her eyes
She says I'm glad you're freeEmbed
