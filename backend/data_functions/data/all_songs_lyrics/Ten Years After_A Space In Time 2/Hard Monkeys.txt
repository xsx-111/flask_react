Hard Monkeys Lyrics
Got no monkey on my back
And I'm never going to crack

'Cause it's a good life
Too good to lose
But it's a hard world
With the junkie blues

Got no street car called desire
And I'll never light the fire

'Cause it's a good life
Too good to lose
But it's a hard world
With the junkie blues

Got no monkey on my back
And I'm never going to crack

'Cause it's a good life
Too good to lose
But it's a hard world
With the junkie bluesEmbed
