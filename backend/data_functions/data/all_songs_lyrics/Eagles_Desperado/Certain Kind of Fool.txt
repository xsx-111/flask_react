Certain Kind of Fool Lyrics
He was a poor boy, raised in a small family
He kinda had a craving for something no one else could see
They say that he was crazy, the kind that no lady should meet
He ran out to the city and wandered around in the street
He wants to dance, oh yeah
He wants to sing, oh yeah
He wants to see the lights a flashing
And listen to the thundering
He saw it in a window, the mark of a new kind of man
He kind of liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand
He took it to the country and practiced for days without rest
And then one day he felt it, he knew he could stand with the best
They got respect, oh yeah
He wants the same, oh yeah
And it's a certain kind of fool
Who likes to hear the sound of his own name
A poster on a storefront, the picture of a wanted man
He had a reputation spreading like fire through the land
It wasn't for the money, at least it didn't start that way
It wasn't for the running, but now he's running everydayEmbed
