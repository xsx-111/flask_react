Out of Control Lyrics
Oh, my, don't the sky look spacious
With the stars all shining down
Well, I can hear the night wind howling
It's a high and lonesome sound
And I ain't had a woman in so long
I can't feed my starving soul
Come on, saddle up, boys, we're gonna ride into town
We're gonna get a little out of control

There's a card game in the corner
And the barmaid smiled at me
Well, I tipped her a sliver dollar and
She brought me a drink for free
All the town-folk call her the cheap one
And the gamblers call her Flo
Come on, set 'em up again
I got me a friend, and I think I'm getting out of control
Oh, oh, oh

She's cool water, her mama taught her
I got news, she's mine and mine alone

And if anybody's looking for trouble
You know I'm the one you want to try
Well, I'll fight any man who wants to
And I don't care who or why
You got to gamble on your story
You got no guts, you get no glory
And I'm betting my money on an ace in the hole
Think I'm getting out of control
We've done it now
Where's my baby?
Where'd you go, baby?Embed
