Bitter Creek LyricsOnce I was young and so unsure
I'd try any ill to find the cure
An old man told me
Tried to scold me
"Whoa, son, don't wade too deep
In Bitter Creek"
(Bitter Creek)
Out where the desert meets the sky
Is where I go when I wanna hide
Oh, peyote (oh, peyote, oooh...)
She tried to show me (tried to show me)
You know there ain't no cause to weep
At Bitter Creek
(Bitter Creek)
We're gonna hit the road for one last time
We can walk right in and steal 'em blind
All that money (all that money, oooh...)
No more runnin' (no more runnin')
I can't wait to see the old man's face
When I win the race
(Bitter Creek)Embed
