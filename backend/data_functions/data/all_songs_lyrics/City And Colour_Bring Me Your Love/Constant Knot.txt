Constant Knot Lyrics
How much would you bet
That if I tried hard enough
I would spontaneously combust?
I wish I could disappear
And run away from all of my fear
I think I'm coming undone

So stay the night
I promise that I won't bite
'Cause without you there
I don't think I could close my eyes

How do I end up this way?
A constant knot in my gut
Tied with uncertainty and with lust
A classic case, I suppose
A haunted man who can't outrun his ghost
They're in my skin and my bones

So stay the night
I promise that I won't bite
'Cause without you there
I don't think I could close my eyes
And now I sing1Embed
