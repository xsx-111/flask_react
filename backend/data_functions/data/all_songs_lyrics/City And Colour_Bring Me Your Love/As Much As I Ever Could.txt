As Much As I Ever Could Lyrics
Ooh (x3)

Love, love of mine
Won't you lay by my side
and rest your weary eyes
Before we're out of time
Give me one last kiss
For soon, such distance
Will stretch between our lips
Now the day's losing light
Ooh (x3)

Bring me your love tonight (x2)

Lost at sea
My heartbeat was growing weak
Hoping you'd hear my plea
and come save my life
As the storm grew fierce
and danger was certainly near
I knew there was nothing to fear
Bring me your love tonight (x2)
No I am not where I belong
Bring me your love tonight
No I am not where I belong
So shine a light and guide me home
No I am not where I belong
So shine a light and guide me back home

Ooh (x3)Embed
