Faithless LyricsPlease believe in what I say
Cause I'm running out of ways to convey
This lack of faith in myself
That's becoming my own personal hell
Vicious cold now settles in
My bones feel like their breaking through my skin
Well god damn you you're feeding on my loneliness
What an awful way to live, what a way to live
Get me out of this place
Cause I'm stuck in a rut and I can't stomach the taste
My lungs are filling up with dust
I feel bruised and broken with no one left to trust
Vicious cold now settles in
My bones feel like their breaking through my skin
God damn you you're feeding on my loneliness
But I will not let you in, I won't let you inEmbed
