Sensible Heart LyricsI get so distracted
By some people's reactions
That I don't see my own faults
For what they are
For what they are
At times so self destructive
With no intent or motive
But behind this emotion
A sensible heart
A sensible heart
See, I'm no king, I wear no crown
Desperate times, they seem over now
But still I weaken, some how
And it tears me apart
It tears me apart
But I hope to learn as time goes by
That I should trust what's deep inside
Burning bright, oh burning bright:
My sensible heart
My sensible heart
My sensible heart
My sensible heart5Embed
