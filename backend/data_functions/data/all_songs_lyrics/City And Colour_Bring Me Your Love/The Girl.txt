The Girl Lyrics
I wish I could do better by you
Cause that's what you deserve
You sacrifice so much of your life
In order for this to work
While I'm off chasing my own dreams
Sailing around the world
Please know that I'm yours to keep
My beautiful girl
When you cry a piece of my heart dies
Knowing that I may have been the cause
If you were to leave
Fulfill someone else's dreams
I think I might totally be lost

You don't ask for no diamond rings
No delicate string of pearls
That's why I wrote this song to sing
My beautiful girl
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
Verse 1
I wish I could do better by you
Cause that's what you deserve
You sacrifice so much of your life
In order for this to work
While I'm off chasing my own dreams
Sailing around the world
Please know that I'm yours to keep
My beautiful girl
And when you cry a piece of my heart dies
Knowing that I may have been the cause
If you were to leave
Fulfill someone else's dreams
I think I might totally be lost

But you don't ask for no diamond rings (diamond rings)
No delicate string of pearls (string of pearls)
That's why I wrote this song to sing
My beautiful girl
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
But you don't ask for no diamond rings (diamond rings)
No delicate string of pearls (string of pearls)
That's why I wrote this song to sing
My beautiful girl (my beautiful girl)
