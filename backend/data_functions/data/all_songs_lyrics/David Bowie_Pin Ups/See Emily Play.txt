See Emily Play Lyrics
Emily tries but misunderstands
She is often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'til
Tomorrow

There is no other day
Let us try it another way
You will lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
