Here Comes the Night Lyrics
Ohhhhh... here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Oh, yeah (here comes the night)
I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
With another guy
His arms around her
Like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die

Yeah, here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Yeah... (here comes the night)

There they go, funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why cannot I accept
The fact she's chosen him
And simply let them be?

Oh she is with him
They are turning down the lights
Now he is holding her the way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes
And telling him lies
Exactly like she told me too2Embed
