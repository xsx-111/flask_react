Friday on My Mind Lyrics
Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I feel better
Even my old man looks good
Wednesday just do not go
Thursday goes too slow
I have got Friday on my mind

(See my baby)
Going to have fun in the city
(feel like fucking you)
(Do my baby screw)
Be with my girl
She is so pretty
(all I want to do)
(I will go crazy)
She looks fine tonight
(zoom zoom zoom)
She is out of sight to me (so divine)
(Tonight) I spend my bread
(Tonight) I lose my head
(Tonight) I have got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind
Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue)

There is nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar
Man, thief)
Hey I will change that scene one day
Today I might be mad
Tomorrow I will be glad
'Cause I will have Friday on my mind

(See my baby) (feel like fucking you)
Gonna have fun
(zoom zoom zoom)
Be with my girl Embed
