Rosalyn Lyrics
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you have been
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you have been
All the night and all the day
Hide and seek's the game you play
Treat me as sure as sin

Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn
Hey Rosalyn, you are the girl for me
Hey Rosalyn, you are the girl for me
When I am holding you so tight
It is so hard to say goodnight
It is you that I love now can't you see?

Do you really love me, do you love me true
Do you really love me Rosalyn?
Yeah got to know, yeah got to know
Yeah got to know Rosalyn

Yeah got to know, yeah got to know
Yeah got to know Rosalyn
Rosalyn
Yeah Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, ooh-yeah, ahEmbed
