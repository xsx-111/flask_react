Where Have All the Good Times Gone Lyrics
In my life I've never stopped
To worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out
And never tried to see
Wondering if I've done wrong
Will this depression last for long
Won't you tell me

Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Once we had an easy ride
And always felt the same
Time was on our side
And I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days
Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mummy didn't need no boys
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
Get your feet back on the ground
Won't you tell me

Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times goneEmbed
