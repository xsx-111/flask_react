Little Sister Lyrics
Little sister won't you please, please, please?
Little sister don't you cheat on me
Little sister don't you kiss me once and twice
Say it's very nice and then you run
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Little sister don't you do what your big sister done

Well, I dated your big sister
And I took her to a show
I went out for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out the door

Sister won't you please, please, please?
Little sister don't you cheat on me
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Say it's very nice and then you run
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Little sister don't you do what your big sister done

Well, every time I see your sister
Seems like she's got somebody new
Well, she's mean and evil
Like that little old boll weevil
Got to try my luck with you
Sister won't you please, please, please?
Little sister don't you cheat on me
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Say it's very nice and then you run
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Little sister don't you do what your big sister done


Well, now I used to pull your pigtails
And I pinched your turned up nose
Baby, you been growin'
Yes, it's been showin'
From your head down to your toes

Well sister won't you please, please, please?
Little sister don't you cheat on me
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Say it's very nice and then you run
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Little sister don't you do what your big sister done

Little sister won't you please, please, please?
Little sister don't you cheat on me
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Say it's very nice and then you run
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Little sister don't you do what your big sister done
Don't you do what your big sister done
Don't you do what your big sister done
Sister, don't you do what your big sister done
Don't you do what your big sister done
No, don't you do what your big sister doneEmbed
