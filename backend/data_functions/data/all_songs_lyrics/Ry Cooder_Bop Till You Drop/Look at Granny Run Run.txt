Look at Granny Run Run Lyrics
Said, look at Granny run, run
Grandpa runnin' close behind
Look at Granny run, run
There's something on Granddaddy's mind

Because he went to the doctor, got a brand new pill
The doctor said, "Son, you ain't over the hill"
He can't sit still
Great, gosh, almighty

Won't you look at Granny run, run (You better run)
Faster than a Greyhound bus (Somebody's calling you)
Look at Granny run, run (You better run)
Now Grandpa is gettin' serious (Somebody's calling you)

Well, he woke up in the middle of the night
He said, "Look-a here baby, everything's alright"
It was such a sight
Great, gosh, almighty, won't ya

Well, look at Granny run, run (Granny, you better run)
Grandpa's runnin' closer now (Somebody's calling you)
No matter how she run, run (Granny, you better run)
He gonna catch her anyhow (Somebody's calling you)

Well, he jumped up and he began to shout
And Granny come a-running with her mouth poked out
He said, "Look a-here, Mama, stop your carrying on
All I want's a little loving just before I'm gone
Ain't a-nothing wrong"
Hear my Lord, singing
Great God almighty

Won' you
(Granny you better run)
(Somebody's calling you)
Look at Granny run, run (Somebody's calling you)
Look at Granny run, run (Somebody's calling you)
Won't you look at her run, run (Somebody's calling you)
Better look at Granny run, run (Somebody's calling you)
Look at Granny run, run (Somebody's calling you)
Better look at Granny run, run (Somebody's calling you)
(Somebody's calling you)
Look at Granny run, run (Somebody's calling you)
Well, I feel like my time ain't (long)
Time ain't (long)
Time ain't (long)Embed
