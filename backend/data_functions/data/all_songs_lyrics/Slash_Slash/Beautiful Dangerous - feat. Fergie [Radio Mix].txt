Beautiful Dangerous - feat. Fergie  LyricsI don't know who you are now
Mystery drenches my brain
I wanna jump deep into your cloud
'cuz something tells me it's gonna rain
I hear the drum rolls thumping
And my heart starts jumping
And that's when I spit on the floor
Now my head's exploding
And your gun is dirty
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll
Well, it's a fine time
Looking for a wine time man
And you said: baby, you ready to play?
Well come ride on this rollercoaster
'cuz it ain't over, it ain't over
Rebel of this party
I'm in love with all your danger, danger
We can live forever
I can be your pagan angel, angel
Beautiful dangerous
We acted smooth like brandy
Savor the flavor with delight
You can be Sid, I'll be Nancy
'cuz sometimes it's more fun to fight
I hear the drum rolls thumping
And my heart starts jumping
And that's when I spit on the floor
Now my head's exploding
And your gun is dirty
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll
Well, it's a fine time
Looking for a wine time man
And you said: baby, you ready to play?
Well come ride on this rollercoaster
'cuz it ain't over, it ain't over
Rebel of this party
I'm in love with all your danger, danger
We can live forever
I can be your pagan angel, angel
