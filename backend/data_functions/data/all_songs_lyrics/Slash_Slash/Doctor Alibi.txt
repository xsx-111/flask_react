Doctor Alibi Lyrics
I went to see the doctor
He said, "You're pretty sick
You got some real bad habits
You'd better stop right quick"
I said, "Doctor, that's real bad news
Don't know what I'm going to do"

Doctor, there's nothing wrong with me
Doctor doctor, can't you see
Doctor, I ain't going to die
Just write me an alibi

I went to see a shaman
He said, "You'll be alright
Just keep doing what you love
Every single night"
I said, "That's what I need to hear"
Took away my childish fears

Doctor, you're a stand up guy
Doctor doctor, my oh my
Doctor, you're the one for me
That's the mojo that I need
Don't you know that I feel alright
Doing what I do
I ain't gonna tow the line
Not till I turn blue
All I got is one short life
That's what people say
And I ain't going to waste a second
Doing what you say


I won't be the one you like
I won't be the boy next door
I won't be the chosen one
That's not what I'm here for
I don't like the way you are
I despise what you hold dear
Don't you try to make me change
I'll haunt you for a thousand years

Doctor, don't you talk that way
Doctor, don't you mess my day
Doctor, stay away from me
Sick is what I'd rather be
Doctor doctor doctor death
Doctor doctor, out of breath
Doctor, I ain't going to die
Just write me an alibiEmbed
