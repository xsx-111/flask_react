I Hold On Lyrics
I feel your comfort in my dreams
Unprotected silent screams
A light, beyond your shadow, beams
Still, I don't know what it means

When seasons change
Memories remain

I hold on because I won't let go
Even though I know there's solitude below
I hold on because I can't let go
And I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on

And when the darkness turns to day
I won't let you drift away
Conscience fades and some let go
But I hang on 'cause I know

When seasons change
Memories remain
I hold on because I won't let go
Even though I know there's solitude below
I hold on because I can't let go
And I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on
I hold on because I won't let go
Even though I know there's solitude below
I hold on because I can't let go
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on
No, no
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on
I hold on
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
Oh, I hold on2Embed
