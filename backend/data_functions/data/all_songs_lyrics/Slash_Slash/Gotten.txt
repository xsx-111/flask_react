Gotten Lyrics
So nice to see your face again
Tell me, how long has it been
Since you've been here? (since you've been here)
Look so different than before
But still the person I adore
Frozen with fear

I'm out of love but I'll take it from the past
All out of words 'cause I'm sure it'll never last
Ooh

I've been saving
These last words for
One last miracle
But now I'm not sure
And I can't save you
If you don't let me
You just get me
Like I never been gotten before

Oh, maybe it's a bitter wind
A chill from the Pacific rim
That brought you this way (brought you my way)
Do not make me think of him
The way he touched your fragile skin
It haunts me everyday
I'm out of love but I can't forget the past
I'm out of words but I'm sure it'll never last
Oh

I've been saving
These last words for
One last miracle
But now I'm not sure
I can't save you
If you don't let me
You just get me
Like I never been gotten before
Like I never been gotten before

So nice to see your face again
But tell me, will this ever end?
Don't disappear

I've been saving
These last words for
One last miracle
But now I'm not sure
I can't save you
If you don't let me
You just get me
Like I never been gotten before, yeah yeah yeah
Like I never been gotten before8Embed
