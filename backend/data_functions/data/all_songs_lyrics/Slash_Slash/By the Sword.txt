By the Sword Lyrics
With the horses that you ride
And the feelings left inside
Comes a time you need to leave all that behind
Well, they claim they'd like to know
Anyone could let it go
And the people gather 'round for the last show

Well, there is a reward
To live and die by the sword
Well, they tried to complicate you
But you left it all behind
All worldly possessions
Are left for recollection
And finally it's all gone

They're releasing all the hounds
What is lost can still be found
When you hop up off your feet, you're on the ground
Well, there's some who choose to run
Following the setting sun
And now it seems the journey has begun

Well, there is a reward
To live and die by the sword
Well, they tried to complicate you
But you left it all behind
All worldly possessions
Are left for recollection
And finally it's all gone


With the horses that you ride
And the feelings left inside
Comes a time you need to leave all that behind

Well, there is a reward
To live and die by the sword
Well, they tried to complicate you
But you left it all behind
All worldly possessions
Are left for recollection
And finally it's all goneEmbed
