Crucify the Dead Lyrics
The fire started long ago
The flames burned out, still embers glow
So charred and black
There's nothing left to burn, to burn

We had the same dream
Lived life to extreme
A loaded gun jammed by a rose

The thorns are not around your head
Your ego cut you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me, you're dead, yeah

The future isn't set in stone
Decisions past leave you alone
Betrayed us all with your own selfish greed
Your greed, yeah

New soldiers now stand
At your beck and command
Recruited, all bought and paid by you
The thorns are not around your head
Your ego cut you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me, you're dead, yeah

We were like brothers with the world in our hands
You always had too much to say
Someday you'll look back and you'll wonder why
You let it all slip away, yeah


Crucify the dead
Crucify the dead

The thorns are not around your head
Your ego cut you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah1Embed
