Back from Cali Lyrics
Woke up this morning all alone
I got a ringing in my head
I couldn't take it anymore today
She left me here for dead
Oh, woah, yeah, yeah

And it should come as no surprise
I should have known it from the start
The lights are faded and I can't deny
This place ain't got no heart
Oh, if you can hear me tonight
If you can hear me tonight

You'll have to carry me back from Cali
I'm tired and broken and I lost my way
You'll have to carry me back to where I belong
You'll have to carry me back from Cali
I don't want money, I don't need no fame
You'll have to carry me back to where I belong

I got to leave this angel city
But I can't do it by myself
So if you please, mama, can you save me
Before I blow this life to hell?
Ooh
Mama, grab me by the feet and just drag me home

You'll have to carry me back from Cali
I don't care if you think I'm to blame
You'll have to carry me back to where I belong
You'll have to carry me back from Cali
The angel city where the devils play
You'll have to carry me back to where I belong, yeah

If you can hear me tonight
If you can hear me tonight
If you can hear me tonight
If you can hear me tonight
I've lost my way, I'm so alone
And all I want is to come home2Embed
