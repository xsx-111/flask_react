Nothing to Say Lyrics
We seem so lost and jaded
Well, what a price to pay
Fear can be overstated
And you seem infatuated
With finding who's to blame

While it can seem so hard now
I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way
Don't tell me it's too late
'Cause I feel it too, we all love to hate
And let others lead the way

Some searching to find
That life with a new peace of mind

And still we march further away
Singing our songs of yesterday
While so much still stands in our way
Voices with nothing to say

Some feel that life's a fable
While some don't have the time
Worship and kiss the altar
All hail the mighty father
But love will keep you blind
Same questions we keep asking
Won't hear the answers 'cause we're scared of what we'll find
We try and compensate through our troubled faith
That should keep us safe
And keep searching for a sign

Some searching to find
That life with a new piece of mind

And still we march further away
Singing our songs of yesterday
While so much still stands in our way
Voices with nothing to say

There won't be another day
No changing of the seasons
And no one's going to save us from the lies
The greatest story ever told
Is only what you make it
Power and struggle and fear, all by design

And still we march further away (We seem so lost and jaded)
Singing our songs of yesterday (Just is not hard to point the blame)
While so much still stands in our way (Yeah)
Voices with nothing to say1Embed
