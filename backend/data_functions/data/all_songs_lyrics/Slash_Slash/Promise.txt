Promise Lyrics
The first time I ever saw you
You had that far away look in your eyes
And heaven's light shined down upon you
And the whole room filled up with light
Well, the cruel world it's gon' try to change you
Try to hang you up and mess with your pride
Now, the rips and tears try to drain you
You've got to keep your fire burning and fight

Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire
Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire

Now, sometimes, the world tries to slap you
And it seems to love watching you fall
I won't lie to you, it's gonna happen
You got to pick yourself up and move on

Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire
Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire

Which star will I be thinking of tonight?
Tonight
Which star will I be thinking of tonight?
Tonight

Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire
Promise me
You won't let them put out your fire
Put out your fire

Promise me
(Why don't you)
Promise me
(Why don't you)
Promise me
(Why don't you)
Promise me
(Why don't you)3Embed
