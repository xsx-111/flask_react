Mother Maria Lyrics
For everyone I loved and every road I've known
For all the trash I won
I celebrate alone
Sit up straight, stupid, bite your tongue
The best that I am is said and done

Screams and whispers
Tell her I no longer hear her

Mother Mary, she don't talk to me
Mother Mary, she don't talk to me
Give her my apologies
And tell her not to cry
Mother Maria

I holler like a king trying to keep his throne
But chewing on a stone is the only thing I own
Drugs and lovers
Nothing left under the covers

Anything you want
Anything you need
I've given all I got
For your "attention, please"
You never wanted me
You never wanted me
Sleep with me
Just for the bitter part
About me


Living's hardly
Living's hardly
Tell her I no longer want it


I still don't hear her
I still can't hear her
I don't deserve her
So tell her not to cry
Tell her not to cry
Tell her not to cry
