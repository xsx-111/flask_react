Ghost Lyrics
Kill the ghost that hides in your soul
Rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll (rock, rock)
Rock 'n' roll

Wipe the blood from your halo
Open wound that you hide, your shadow's pride
Spit in the face of the ugly clown
Who'll hunt you down, but you can't hide
Exterminate the future

Kill the ghost that hides in your soul
Kill the ghost that hides in your soul
Rock 'n' roll

Whispers of the future
Broken meth in your skull with a hook in your smile
Exterminate the future

Kill the ghost that hides in your soul
Kill the ghost that hides in your soul
You can't run from the future
Can't change the past
You're not that fast
You can't run from the future
Can't change the past
You're not that fast

Kill the ghost that hides in your soul
Kill the ghost that hides in your soul
Kill the ghost that hides in your soul
Rock 'n' roll

Kill
Rock 'n' roll1Embed
