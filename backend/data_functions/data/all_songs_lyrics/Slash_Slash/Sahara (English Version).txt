Sahara (English Version) Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Noises from the street
Stains on the wall
Secretly meeting behind it all
Voices from the heart
Heat on the velvet skin
Classic dancer's sign
Lighting up the sky

Sorry, I don't remember anything about you
(Anything about you)
Everything is gone now
And I'll set you free (I'll set you free)
Oh, what I made of
Just looking like a loser to me

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
I know it was you who fell asleep first
There was nothing to break the silent peace
You know it was me, all talk and no action
I just wonder why you stayed with me

Sorry, I don't remember anything about you
(Anything about you)
Everything is gone now
What am I going to do? (what can I do?)
This time it's cut me down
Babe, I've got to see it through

Some kind of jealous guy
But I was never losing my mind (losing my mind)
Whatever it took inside
I wanted to tie you down and make you mine

Sorry, I don't remember anything about you
(Anything about you)
Blown up and gone now
Ain't nothing new (ain't nothing new)
Can't do this anymore
Lying to myself
I can't let go of anything about you (anything about you)
Everything is ruined
Got nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
Got to let you know
You're the only one to save my soul
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, heyEmbed
