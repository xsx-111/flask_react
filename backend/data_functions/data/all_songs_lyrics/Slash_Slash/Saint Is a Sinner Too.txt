Saint Is a Sinner Too Lyrics
Hold my hands down
So they don't, they don't reach for you
In case you don't know
A saint is a sinner too
Blind my eyes
So I can't see
What's coming for you
Is coming for me

And I hear the choir sing
Calling me on back to you
And I, I forget, now
Just what I'm supposed to do
When a saint is a sinner too


And I hear the choir sing
Calling me on back to you
And I, I forget, now
Just what I'm supposed to do
When a saint is a sinner too
Ooh, a saint is a sinner, too
Hold, hold my hands down
Hold my hands down
So I don't reach
So I don't reach
So I don't reach for you
Oh
Ah
A saint is a sinner tooEmbed
