Here I Come Lyrics
He said, "Yeah, you better come out with
Your hands up, we got you surrounded"
I'm in the back, changing my outfit
He said, "Blink, we gon' send the hounds in"
I said "Wait, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come
You boys get ready, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come"
He said, "Yeah, you better come out with
Your hands up, we got you surrounded"
I'm in the back, changing my outfit
He said, "Blink, we gon' send the hounds in"
I said "Wait, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come
You boys get ready, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come, yo"

Uh, I'm soul brother one hundred
How much charisma could another one stomach?
If I be the prisoner then I wasn't more cunning
Or wise, if I come outside, I'm not running
Stone lone wolf of the pack, the unwanted
I really got nothin to hide, I'm 'bout cuttin
Go out in a blaze, wouldn't pop one button
I'ma murk, half hurt, leave the cop dogs huntin
The pretty black one in the group, the smooth villain
Under fire cause I'm pennin the words that move millions
Slide right in front of your eyes true brilliance
It's a new bad moon on the rise, who feelin it
New true skill in it y'all, The Roots still in it
Ready plus willin, it's all the true killer shit
You know we got 'em involved, we too diligent
They say the music is strong and too militant
He said, "Yeah, you better come out with
Your hands up, we got you surrounded"
I'm in the back, changing my outfit
He said, "Blink, we gon' send the hounds in"
I said "Wait, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come
You boys get ready, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come, yo"

Black Inc, raw life in this what-you-might-call-it
Weed smokin junkie alcoholic
One foot in the grave, one foot in the toilet
Still I'm onstage, in front of an audience
Disturbing the peace, and the local ordinance
This pimp shit popping, I need coordinates
My ETA, I'll arrive by morning
Money long like the arms on Alonzo Mourning
Vampire chicks suck blood, dusk to dawn and
Waitin to catch me sleep but I'm not yawnin
They in the VIP, at the Garden
They gon jump me when I stop performing
I got something for them behind the organ
I always roll deep with my squadron
The sheriff out front gon' sic the dogs in
That nigga talkin 'bout he got warrants
He said, "Yeah, you better come out with
Your hands up, we got you surrounded"
I'm in the back, changing my outfit
He said, "Blink, we gon' send the hounds in"
I said "Wait, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come
You boys get ready, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come"

I'm in the darkness, heartless, fuck you regardless
Move with hardness, y'all just pressin charges
It's often injury, floss and force my entry
This peninitentiary, knockin' up niggas for centuries
It's elementary like KRS and evidently
Incidents they all stress, I'm lawless
That's my problem, evolve and never solve them
Chill in Harlem, bang you, bring you stardom
You full of boredom, bastard, you been aborted
Bring your neck out, bring the tec' out, absorb it
See you check out, and then step out the orbit
Blow your flesh out 'til I'm fresh out my torment
Street apostle, pop shit, preach the gospel
Still I'm hostile, sippin' a duece when possible
Turn into a monster, grouchy, gimme the Oscar
Hit you like vodka, then screech off in a Mazda
He said, "Yeah, you better come out with
Your hands up, we got you surrounded"
I'm in the back, changing my outfit
He said, "Blink, we gon' send the hounds in"
I said "Wait, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come
You boys get ready, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come"
He said, "Yeah, you better come out with
Your hands up, we got you surrounded"
I'm in the back, changing my outfit
He said, "Blink, we gon' send the hounds in"
I said "Wait, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come
You boys get ready, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come, yo"3Embed
