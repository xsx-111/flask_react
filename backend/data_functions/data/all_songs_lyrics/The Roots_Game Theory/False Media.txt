False Media Lyrics
"And we will weaken ourselves for what is really the issue. And then, behind that all lies a very personal, intuitive belief: that I don't think old men ought to promote wars for young men to fight."
America's lost somewhere inside of Littleton
Eleven million children are on Ritalin
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
False media—we don't need it, do we?
Pilgrims, slaves, Indian, Mexican
It looks real fucked up for your next of kin
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
False media—

If I can't work to make it, I'll rob and take it
Either that or me and my children are starving and naked
Rather be a criminal pro than to follow The Matrix
Hey, it's me, the monster y'all done created, I been inaugurated
Keep the bright lights out of our faces
You can't shake it; it ain't no way to swallow the hatred
Aim, fire, holler 'bout a dollar, nothing is sacred
We gon' pimp the shit out of nature
Send our troops to get my paper
Tell 'em, "Stay away from them skyscrapers
Ain't long 'fore you get y'all acres"
I'ma show 'em who the glo-bal gangster
Sentence me to four more years, thank you
I'ma make you feel a little bit safer, because it ain't over—
See, that's how we get your fear to control you
But ain't nobody under more control than the soldier
And how could you expect a kid to keep his composure
When all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure again?
America's lost somewhere inside of Littleton
Eleven million children are on Ritalin
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
False media—we don't need it, do we?
Pilgrims, slaves, Indian, Mexican
It looks real fucked up for your next of kin
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
False media—we don't need it, do we?
America's lost somewhere inside of Littleton
Eleven million children are on Ritalin
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
False media—we don't need it, do we?
Pilgrims, slaves, Indian, Mexican
It looks real fucked up for your next of kin
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
False media—we don't need it, do we?
America's lost somewhere inside of Littleton
Eleven million children are on Ritalin
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
False media—we don't need it, do we?
Pilgrims, slaves, Indian, Mexican
It looks real fucked up for your next of kin
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
False media—we don't need it, do we?
False media—we don't need it, do we?
False media—we don't need it, do we?
False media—we don't need it, do we?Embed
