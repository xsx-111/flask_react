Devil Doll Lyrics
Once upon a long time ago lived a humble puppet maker
His son lost and died
Blamed himself as he tried
To sell his soul ever after

I have the power if you have the nerve
You will be mine
My request you will serve
A flash of his tail and a spread of his wings
I hold the power
The devil did sing
He signed in blood along a dotted line
By the silence
Here's the soul of your boy
As I promised, in this toy
Pull his strings and hear my laughter

No use in trying, the damage is done
What have I done, oh, my beautiful son?
The deal has been sealed, signed, delivered to Hell
My deep, darkest secrets and no one to tell

Once upon a long time ago lived evil
Awakened to find that you're looking through the eyes
Of a madman's evil monster
Devil Doll, Devil Doll
Evil be thy master
Devil Doll, Devil Doll
Evil be thy master

No use in trying, the damage is done
What have I done, oh, my beautiful son?
The deal has been sealed, signed, delivered to Hell
My deep, darkest secrets and no one to tell

Awakened to find that you're looking through the eyes
Of a madman's evil monster

Evil be thy master
A madman's evil monster
Evil be thy masterEmbed
