Scream! Lyrics
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-ah-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Scre-ee-eam

A chill runs up your spine
And crawls into your brain
The freezing touch of fear
It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight
Dragged from the (Ohhhh)
Silence where you hide (Ohhhh)

'Til you scream
'Til you scream

A chill runs up your spine
And crawls into your brain
The freezing touch of fear
It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight
Dragged from the (Ohhhh)
Silence where you hide (Ohhhh)
'Til you scream
'Til you scream
Scream
I can't wait to hear you scream

It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight
Dragged from the (Ohhhh)
Silence where you hide (Ohhhh)

'Til you scream
Scream (Scream, scream)

I can't wait to hear you
I can't wait to hear you
Scream
I can't wait to hear you
I can't wait to hear you
Scream
Scream
