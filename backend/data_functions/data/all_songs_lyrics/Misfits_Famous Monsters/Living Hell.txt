Living Hell Lyrics
Imprisoned in this World
Of darkness few have known
A monster lusting blood and
The hunger grows
Out on the street, dangers real
The killers still at large
A trail of death through the sewers
To the underground

I feel their fleeting life
Draw into my bones
Hear the heart that pounds
The blood that flows
Eternity I damn thee
Let me rot into the ground
As the empty veins collapse
Cast them down

Living Hell, Living Hell, Living Hell
I just can't go on
In this Living Hell

This town has worn thin
Everybody knows
Panic in the news
And the terror grows
A tunnel full of filth
Escape into the night
Another hole to dwell in
The Underground
I feel their fleeting life
Draw into my bones
Hear the heart that pounds
The blood that flows
Eternity I damn thee
Let thee rot into the ground
As the empty veins collapse
Cast them down

Living Hell, Living, Living Hell
I just can't go on
In this Living HellEmbed
