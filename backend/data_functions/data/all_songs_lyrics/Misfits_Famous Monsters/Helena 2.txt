Helena 2 Lyrics
If I cut off your arms and cut off your legs
Would you still love me anyway?
If you're bound and you're gagged, draped and displayed
Would you still love me anyway?

Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?

If I cut off your arms and cut off your legs
Would you still love me anyway?
If you're bound and you're gagged, draped and displayed
Would you still love me, love me anyway?

Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?

Go!
Cutting with the knife, blood is spilling everywhere
She will be my wife, secondary spine
Incisions must be accurate, I know just what to do
My hands are trembling, I can't spare to slip up with this knife
Her beauty so illogical, the beast come gliding in
Hideous chameleon stripped down to her skin
Dance to the burning flame, pleasure exhumes the pain
The night bursts into flames
Dance, Helena, dance, oh
If I cut off your arms and I cut off your legs
Would you still love me anyway?
There's a spot on the floor where your limbs used to be
And I close the door on my fantasies

Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
