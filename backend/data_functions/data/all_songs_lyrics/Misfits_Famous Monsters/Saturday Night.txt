Saturday Night Lyrics
Hm, hmm
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

There's fifty-two ways to murder anyone
One and two are the same and they both work as well
I'm coming clean for Amy
Julie doesn't scream as well and the cops won't listen all night
And so maybe I'll be over
Just as soon as I fill them all in

And I can remember when I saw her last
We were runnin' all around and havin' a blast, havin' a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home

I was thinkin' about you, there was somethin' I forgot to say
I was cryin' on Saturday night
I was out cruisin' without you
They were playin' our song
Cryin' on Saturday night
As the moon becomes the night time
You go viciously, quietly, away
I'm sitting in the bedroom
Where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes
Now I'm watchin', watchin' you die
Oh oh oh oh oh

I can remember when I saw her last
We were runnin' all around and havin' a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home

I was thinkin' about you, there was somethin' I forgot to say
I was cryin' on Saturday night
I was out cruisin' without you
They were playin' our song
Cryin' on Saturday night

Cryin' on Saturday night9Embed
