Hunting Humans Lyrics
Upon this threshold of disaster
The birth of the eleventh plague
The fires burn at night
I begin to doubt the smell of burning flesh
Will ever fade away
The touch of death is all around us
A thousand corpses block our way
A man-made germs makes almost everyone commit Suicide
Just to rise and eat their dead
Night of the living Dead

We're hunting humans woah-ooo
We're hunting humans woah-ooo
We're hunting humans woah-ooo
We're hunting humans
It's killing time every day

I can't control this eerie feeling
An evil screaming in my head
I don't think I'll last the night
There is no cure
For this genocide
Or resurrection of the dead
Night of the living dead
We're hunting humans woah-ooo
We're hunting humans woah-ooo
We're hunting humans woah-ooo
We're hunting humans
It's killing time every day
It's killing time every day
It's killing time every dayEmbed
