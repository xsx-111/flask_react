Lost in Space Lyrics
Go!

Of all the things they taught you  I'm telling you this son
All the wars fought before won't compare to this one
Giant spiders prepare to take over
Here comes another mutant Suicide-Squad
You blast them out, but now you're way off course
You start to shiver and shake
I'm calling you, Houston

Am I following all the right leads?
Or am I about to get lost in space?
When my time comes
They'll write my destiny
Will you take this ride?

Communication's lost, we crash to the earth
Too late to see the giant spider monster giving birth
The future is here, and here is the future

Am I following all the right leads?
Or am I about to get lost in space?
When my time comes
They'll write my destiny
Will you take this ride?
Will you take this ride?
Will you take this ride?
Will you take this ride?

Am I following all the right leads?
Or am I about to get lost in space?
When my time comes
They'll write my destiny
Will you take this ride?

Will you take this ride with me?
Will you take this ride?
Will you take this ride?
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Will you take this ride?
Will you take this ride?
(Me) Will you take this ride?
Will you take this ride?
Whoa, oh, oh-oh-ohEmbed
