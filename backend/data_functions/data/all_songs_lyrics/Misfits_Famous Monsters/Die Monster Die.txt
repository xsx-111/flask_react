Die Monster Die Lyrics
First things first, Ms. Monroe rises from the dead
The henchmen came, knocked down the door
To my never never world

I hope you die
Die monster die
Die monster die
Die monster die

First things first
We must find out which mirror evil lives
I enter this door, look into the mirror
I don't recognize this face
It's lookin' back at me

Die
Die monster die
Die monster die
Die monster die

There's a place where the mirror don't lie
There's a place where the mirror don't lie
There's a place where the mirror don't lie
There's a place where the mirror don't lie
I hope you die
Die monster die
Die monster die
Die monster die
Die monster die
(There's a place where the mirror don't lie)
Die monster die
(There's a place where the mirror don't lie)
Die monster die
(There's a place where the mirror don't lie)
Die monster die
(There's a place where the mirror don't lie)

Die monster die!Embed
