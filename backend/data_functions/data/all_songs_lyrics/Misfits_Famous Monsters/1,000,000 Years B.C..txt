1,000,000 Years B.C. Lyrics
One, two, three, four

They're calling me, creatures of the night
Beautiful music, animal instincts survived
The serpent's tongue, so ancient, before the dawn of time
Fed throughout the ages on the blood of mankind

Ooh, I've seen it all
Ooh, From grace men fall
Babylon
Curse of all creation
Winged serpent of the pit
Monstrosity

One million years BC
One million years BC
One million years BC

Ten thousand centuries ago
Cast down from Heaven to pillage below
The serpent's eyes, still watching for it's easy prey
Feed upon the hopeless, the weak and afraid
Ooh, I've seen it all
Ooh, From grace they fall
Babylon
Curse of all creation
Winged serpent of the pit
Monstrosity

One million years BC
One million years BC
One million years BC
One million years BC
One million years BC
One million years BC
One million years BC
One million years BC
One million years BC
