Forbidden Zone Lyrics
Some say that's where man began
On this wasted piece of land
Where evolution's yet to show
Forbidden zone
Blasting into outer space
The planet of the apes
Evolution's one hero

Crossing a plain into another dimension
A million years into the future
Crossing a path into another dimension
We the unseen

Back on earth it's all you'll read about
All the evidence destroyed
Maps and legends mark the firewalls
We the lost abandoned saviors
Of the forbidden zone

Some say that's where man began
On this wasted piece of land
Where evolution's yet to show
Forbidden zone
Blasting into outer space
The planet of the apes
Evolution's one hero
Crossing a plain into another dimension
A million years into the future
Crossing a path, another dimension
We the unseen

Back on earth it's all you'll read about
All the evidence destroyed
Maps and legends mark the firewalls
We the lost abandoned saviors
Back on earth it's all you'll read about
All the evidence destroyed
Maps and legends mark the firewalls
We the lost abandoned saviors
We shall sustain the forbidden zone
The forbidden zone
The forbidden zone

Blasting into outer space
The planet of the apes
Evolution's one hero
Forbidden zoneEmbed
