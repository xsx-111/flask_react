Scarecrow Man Lyrics
How about a little fire, scarecrow?
Ooh, uh!

Hangin' in a field you'll never know I'm out here
I'm telling you people, best beware
I creep into town, I'm hunting my prey
Back on my post by the crack of day

Lock your doors, watch your back, it's true
Turn around, how do you do?
I'm the scarecrow man
I'm the scarecrow man

People dying every night
Mutilation's a terrible sight
Look 'round the victims really hard
Scarecrow's death straw calling card

And I'm coming and killing, it's true
Turn around, how do you do?
I'm the scarecrow man
I'm the scarecrow man
Scarecrow man
Scarecrow man
I'm the scarecrow man
I'm the scarecrow man

Hangin' in a field you'll never know I'm out here
I'm telling you people best beware
I creep into town, I'm hunting my prey
Back on my post by the crack of day

I've come to kill you, I will!
I'm gonna get you, be still!
I'm the scarecrow man
I'm the scarecrow man
I'm the scarecrow man
Scarecrow man

I'm the scarecrow man
I'm the scarecrow man
I'm the scarecrow manEmbed
