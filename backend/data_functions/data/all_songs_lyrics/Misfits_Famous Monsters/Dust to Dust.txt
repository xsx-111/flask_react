Dust to Dust Lyrics
Hate you father
For you have sinned
Why did you, Lord
Let this life begin?
I'm not your savior
I'm not your son
A forgotten boy
Abandoned creation

With these final words, I pull the switch
We turn to dust
Dust to dust
My name is like the kiss of death, then we embrace
We turn to dust
With these final words, I pull the switch
We turn to dust
Dust to dust
My name is like the kiss of death, then we embrace
We turn to dust
Turn to dust

Oh
Mother, Father
Answer me
Your soul-less son
Your thing that should not be
A brilliant demon
A monster god
You gave me life
But took the soul away
With these final words, I pull the switch
We turn to dust
Dust to dust
My name is like the kiss of death, then we embrace
We turn to dust
With these final words, I pull the switch
We turn to dust
Dust to dust
My name is like the kiss of death
Ashes to ashes
We turn to dust

Now we belong dead
We belong dead
We belong dead
We belong

With these final words, I pull the switch
We turn to dust
Dust to dust
My name is like the kiss of death, then we embrace
We turn to dust
With these final words, I pull the switch
We turn to dust
Dust to dust
My name is like the kiss of death, then we embrace
We turn to dust
We turn to dust1Embed
