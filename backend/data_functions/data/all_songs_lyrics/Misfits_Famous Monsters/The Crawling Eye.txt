The Crawling Eye Lyrics
It's such a steep climb up the mountain's south side
It has a cloud that acts in such peculiar ways
Accident count rising, a young girl prophesizing
To protect their race, they'll seize her mind

At this altitude it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell, who's seen the crawling eye?
At this altitude it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell, who's seen the crawling eye?

These evil demon eyes
Under cloud cover hide
They have great tentacles to tear apart their prey
All these men are dying, crawling eye decapatizing
Fiends without a face attack mankind

At this altitude it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell, who's seen the crawling eye?
At this altitude it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell, who's seen the crawling eye?
Crawling Eye!
Crawling Eye!
