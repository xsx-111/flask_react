Them Lyrics
Man's atomic age is here
Horrifying hordes appear

Exo-Skeleton armored
Exo-Skeleton might
Exo-Skeleton horror
Exo-skeleton bite
Beware of them!
Beware of them

Something wicked this way comes
Creepy crawling giant bugs

Exo-Skeleton armored
Exo-Skeleton might
Exo-Skeleton horror
Exo-Skeleton bite
Beware of them
Beware of them!

In the desert sands where they test the bombs
Came these man-made monsters
They'll try to breed
They'll fly by night
We must destroy these nests of the mutant ants
These man-made monsters
Their bodies burn
A gruesome sight
Beware of them
Beware of them!

Evil is as humans do
Bible prophecy comes true

In the desert sands where they test the bombs
Came these man-made monsters
They'll try to breed
They'll fly by night
We must destroy these nests of the mutant ants
These man-made monsters
Their bodies burn
A gruesome sight

Beware of them
Beware of them!Embed
