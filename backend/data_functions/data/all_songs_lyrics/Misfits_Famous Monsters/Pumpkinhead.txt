Pumpkinhead Lyrics
Now this is the story
Of a good man named Ed
Left his son for a moment
Returned, found him dead

Recalls a tale as a boy he was told
Of an evil witch, so wicked, so old
Seeks a farmer's advice he will not give
His oldest son knows just where the witch lived
He took Ed there but refused to go in
The boy knew what was about to begin
She had the power to avenge the dead
It cost your soul, now come with me Ed

I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm gonna take you there, my friend
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
I'm gonna bring you here again

Dig up this grave, the old lady said
The thing we need it lies there dormant, sleeping with the dead
You understand what you ask of me
Not even death can set your soul free
I cast this curse and you will find
An evil darkness deep inside your vengeful mind
God damn you to hell, he could not restrain
He already has son, the witch did explain
I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm gonna take you there, my friend
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
I'm gonna bring you here again

Pumpkinhead! Pumpkinhead!

I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm gonna take you there, she said
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
This curse I cast, you're Pumpkinhead!

Keep away from Pumpkinhead unless you're tired of living
His enemies are mostly dead, he's mean and unforgiving1Embed
