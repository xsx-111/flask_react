Descending Angel Lyrics
Torn from the heavens, they fall from the sky
And walk the streets among mortal men
They hide in shadows, keepers of the night
Mortal life is weak, can't hold back the demons
The blood pours as rain and soon you'll be alone

(Whoa-oh) Descending angel
Stand by my side
(Whoa-oh) We'll face the night
Descending angel
(Whoa-oh) Guard the gates of Hell
Just one more night
(Whoa-oh) For in the morning
Will bring the light

Born or created in the image of a god
The heavens fall, no savior has been sent
No one to guide us; alone, we face the night
Mortal life is brief for the rebel angels
They make their final stand and soon you'll be alone

(Whoa-oh) Descending angel
Stand by my side
(Whoa-oh) And face the night
Descending angel
(Whoa-oh) Guard the gates of Hell
Just one more night
(Whoa-oh) Forever ends tonight
(Whoa-oh) Descending angel
Stand by my side
(Whoa-oh) And face the night
Descending angel
(Whoa-oh) Guard the gates of Hell
Just one more night
(Whoa-oh) Forever ends tonight
Descending angel
Little rebel angel
Little rebel angel
Little rebel angel
Descending angel!Embed
