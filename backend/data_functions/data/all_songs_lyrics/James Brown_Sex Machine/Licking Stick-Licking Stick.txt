Licking Stick-Licking Stick Lyrics
Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick
Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick

People standing
Standing in a trance
Sister out in the backyard
Doing the outside dance

Come and tell me you love me
She didn't want to be a drag
I don't know what she's doing
I think she's got a brand new bag
