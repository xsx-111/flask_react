Downloading Porn With Davo Lyrics
Sleeping in a van between A and B
Sucking dick for ecstacy
Paid a 70-year-old hooker to make out with me
Now the get-high shack is just a memory

Downloading porn with Davo
Downloading porn with Davo
Put a latch on the door so Mama don't know
That I'm downloading porn with Davo

Tried to buy your love but I came up short
So I fucked a little waitress in exchange for a snort
My girl's got a dick hanging out of her shorts
Me and Eric in the bathroom with the weather report

Downloading porn with Davo
Downloading porn with Davo
Put a latch on the door so Mama don't know
That I'm downloading porn with Davo

Oh baby, I know you love the good old days
Cruising on the Long Island Expressway
I used to be dead but now I'm gay
All I ever think about is drowning, drowning
Downloading porn with Davo
Downloading porn with Davo
Put a latch on the door so Mama don't know
That I'm downloading porn with DavoEmbed
