What Went Wrong LyricsI can't remember what went wrong
(Please don't tell me)
The walk home was really long
(Please don't tell me)
Just take me to your leader
(Just take me to your leader)
Did you see me? Did you see me?
Did you see me? Did you see me?
I can't remember what went wrong
(Please don't tell me)
The walk home was really long
(Please don't tell me)
Just take me to your leader
(Just take me to your leader)
Did you see me? Did you see me?
Did you see me? Did you see me?Embed
