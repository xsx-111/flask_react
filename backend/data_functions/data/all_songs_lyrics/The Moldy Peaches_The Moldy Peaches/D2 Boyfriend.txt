D2 Boyfriend LyricsWhen I was in middle-school
I had a group of friends
We wore jean jackets and sunglasses and listened to Duran Duran
There were 6 of us so when we played it didn't add up, you see- everybody had a Duran Duran boyfriend but me
I wasn't dating Nick Rhodes
I wasn't dating Roger Taylor
I wasn't dating John Taylor
I wasn't dating Andy Taylor
I wasn't dating Simon LeBon
I was sitting by myself with my collar up, a tear in my eye and an ache in my heart- my Converse on
And my Converse on
My glow-in-the-dark with pink fat laces zebra-striped Converse on
So if you are a kid and no one will play with you
Stick it out, stay tough, and you'll turn out super-cool!
When I go to a party everybody looks the same
I'm the one they recognize. Everybody knows my name
Everybody knows my name
Be yourself, don't do
What everybody tells you to do
Be yourself. Be proud of yourself. You'll be cool
Super cool! (Don't be a fool)Embed
