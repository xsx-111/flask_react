Lucky Charms LyricsYou're a star steal my car just save me
On a roll sell my soul forgiveness
Crossed with red think I'm dead its over
Words you say leave my head or hold me
Holy ground cup of dirt down pavement
Smell your shirt and I hurt till tomorrow
I feel like I'm chasing the guy from Lucky Charms
Fell in love out of love still dreaming
Flying blue without out you slow motion
Baseball champs gothic vamps and stage fright
I love hard as a guard I'm crying
Now you're gone I'm a wave without direction
Baby born lost its way in the forest
I feel like I'm chasing the guy the from Lucky charms
Now I'm gone
Now I'm gone
Now I'm gone
All alone
All alone
All alone
Now I feel like I'm chasing the guy from Lucky charms
All alone
All alone
Leaving home
Leaving home
All aloneEmbed
