I Forgot LyricsDown in the alley, what's your mother made of?
Heads up, seven-up, ding-dong, come in!
I left my wood paneling on the embassy coat rack...
Where is mankind? My big black behind...
Follow your star -- play your guitar
I said candyland, he said toyland
Queen frosting, eleven-teen arzipan
Adam?
I forgot
Where is mankind? My big black behind...
Follow your star -- play your guitar1Embed
