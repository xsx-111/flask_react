Little Bunny Foo Foo LyricsLittle Bunny Foo Foo
Hopping through the forest
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head
Down came the good fairy
And the good fairy said
"Little Bunny Foo Foo
I don't wanna see you
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head."
"I'm gonna give you three chances
Then I'm gonna turn you into a goon!"
LITTLE BUNNY FOO FOO!!!Embed
