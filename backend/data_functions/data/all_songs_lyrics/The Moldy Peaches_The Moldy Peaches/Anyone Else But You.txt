Anyone Else But You Lyrics
You're a part-time lover and a full-time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you

I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
I kiss you all starry-eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you

Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you

The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't, you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you

I will find my niche in your car
With my MP3 DVD rumble-packed guitar
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
Du du du du du du du du
Du du du du du du du du
Du du du du du du du du du

Up up down down left right left right B A Start
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you

You are always trying to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you

We both have shiny happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you

Don Quixote was a steel-driving man
My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
Squinched-up your face and did a dance
You shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you

Du du du du du du du du
Du du du du du du du du
Du du du du du du du du du
But you11Embed
