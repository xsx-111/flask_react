Goodbye Song Lyrics(Adam:)
Packing my bags
Time is a drag
Smell myself to make sure I'm still there
I'm alone in the dark
With the sabre-tooth shark
And every pretty girl that broke my heart
Receding lines
Broken dimes
Who's gonna get their match this time
The maker's at home
Smoking a bone
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
These nightmares
Nightmares
With the repeating cast of characters
I don't wanna talk
When my thoughts are true
I hate myself when I think like you
Cause its over
Its over
Its ancient, its so old
Its ancient
Its ancient
Its so old, lets call the whole thing
Off
Let's call the whole thing
Off
(Kimya:)
Say goodbye
I won't cry
Old friend, see you again
I know
Must go
See red, sore head
Alone here
Alone there
I'm alone everywhere
Say goodbye
I won't cry
Old friend, see you again
So afraid
Back in the day
Tag along, sing song
Bazooka Joe
Punk show
Front row, dammo
3000 miles
New styles
When in Rome, go home
Say goodbye
I won't cry
Old friend, see you again
Say goodbye
I won't cry
Old friend, see you again
Say goodbye
I won't cry
Old friend, I'll see you againEmbed
