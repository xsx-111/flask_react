Lazy Confessions LyricsLazy confessions
Crazy intentions
Scratching unwilling
Sports cars are thrilling
I like potatoes
I don't like tomatoes
I'm goin' fishin
Cos' I'm on a mission
I wanna live for today
I wanna roll in the hay
But I'm floating away
I got nothing to say
It makes me slappy
To walk like your pappy
I need to improvise
Just lookin' at the pies
Boohoo I'm dying
Ravenous sighing
I think you're pretty
My shrink says I'm witty
I wanna live for today
I wanna roll in the hay
But I'm floating away
I got nothing to say
But I'm floating away
I got nothing to sayEmbed
