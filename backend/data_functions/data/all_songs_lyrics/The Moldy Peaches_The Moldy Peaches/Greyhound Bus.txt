Greyhound Bus LyricsI ride the Greyhound bus
I ride it everywhere
Oh how I count the ways
The answer lies within me
I love my roller skates
I ride them everywhere
Circle flows eternally
How can I find a savior
Got the coolest BMX
I ride it everywhere
Tis nobler to die for truth
Tis holy to repent ones sins
My daddy has a Subaru
I ride it everywhere
Time travels like a wave
My mind it travels like a wave
I ride it everywhere
My mind travels like a wave
I ride it everywhere
My mind travels like a waveEmbed
