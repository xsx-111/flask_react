Steak For Chicken Lyrics
Mardi Gras came and went  /  Mardi Gras came and went
All my money has been spent  /  All my money has been spent
How am I gonna pay the rent?  /  How am I gonna pay the rent?
Sitting on your face  /  Sitting on my ass

Who mistook the steak for chicken?
Who am I gonna stick my dick in?
We're not those kids
Sitting on the couch

My former life I was a high roller  /  My former life I had a sister
Dropped my kids in the diamond stroller  /  I abused her and I dissed her
Found my calling as a part time bowler  /  She got swept up in a twister
Traded my wife for a new three-holer  /  First I laughed and then I missed her

Who mistook these baths for showers?
Who fucked up that Leaning Tower?
We're not those kids
Sitting on the couch

Oh get on a Greyhound and ride away  /  Oh get on a Greyhound and ride away
Live on birthday cake each day  /  Different dreams than yesterday
Tell your grandparents that they're gay  /  Tell your grandmas they're okay
Steal their money and run away  /  Kiss their cheek and run away
'Cause me and my friends are so smart  /  Me and my friends are so smart
We invented this new kind of art  /  We invented this new kind of darts
Post modernist, throwing darts  /  Hit a bull's-eye and cut a fart
Smoking crack and cutting crack  /  Smoking crack and cutting crack
Who mistook this crap for genius?  /  Who missed that thing on the ceiling?
Who is gonna stroke my penis?  /  Who is gonna hurt my feelings?
We're not those kids  /  We're not those kids
Sitting on the couch  /  Sitting on the couch

Oh people are shiny like a brand new book  /  Even your mother is a crook
But if you get a closer look  /  But if I get a closer look
There's shit on every hand you shook  /  There's shit on every road you took
If you don't believe me, look at your hand  /  If you don't believe me, read your book

So who made all these things for killing?  /  Somebody's making a killing
Whose pussy hole needs filling?  /  Whose empty heart needs filling?
We're not those kids  /  We're not those kids
Sitting on the couch  /  Sitting on the couch

Who mistook the steak for chicken?
Who am I going to stick my dick in?
We're not those kids
Sitting on the couch
Sitting on the couch
Sitting on the couch
Sitting on the couch1Embed
