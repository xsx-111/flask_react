Jorge Regula Lyrics
My name is Jorge Regula (My name is Jorge Regula)
I'm walking down the street (I'm walking down the street)
I love you (I love you)
Let's go to the beach

Let's go sailing (Let's go sailing)
Let's get a bite to eat (Let's get a bite to eat)
Let's talk about movies (Let's talk about movies)
Let's go to sleep

I wake up in the morning (I wake up in the morning)
Put on my yellow shirt (Put on my yellow shirt)
I get a bite to eat (I get a bite to eat)
I go to work

I'm the AV guy (I'm the AV guy)
I'm the AFNY guy (I'm the AFNY guy)
I'm the piano guy (I'm the piano guy)
Let's go to sleep

I wrote a new song (I wrote a new song)
It has a good beat (It has a good beat)
Let's talk about movies (Let's talk about movies)
Let's get a bite to eat
My name is Jorge Regula (My name is Jorge Regula)
I'm walking down the street (I'm walking down the street)
I love you (I love you)
Let's go to sleep
Let's go to sleepEmbed
