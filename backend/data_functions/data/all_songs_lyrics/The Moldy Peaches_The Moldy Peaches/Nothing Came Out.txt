Nothing Came Out Lyrics
Just because I don't say anything doesn't mean I don't like you
I open my mouth and I try and I try, but no words came out
Without 40 oz. of social skills, I'm just an ass in the crack of humanity
I'm just a huge manatee, a huge manatee

And besides, you're probably holding hands
With some skinny, pretty girl that likes to talk about bands
And all I wanna do is ride bikes with you
And stay up late and watch cartoons

Duck Tales, Shirt Tails, Talespin, Sailor Moon
GI Joe, Robotech, Ron Jeremy, Schmoo

I wanna watch cartoons with you
Josie and the Pussycats and Scooby-Doo
I want you to watch cartoons with me
He-Man, Voltron and Hong Kong Phooey
I tried to ask you to your face but no words came out
I put on my hood and walked away
That doesn't mean I don't like you

And besides, you're probably holding hands
With some skinny, pretty girl that likes to talk about bands
And all I wanna do is ride bikes with you
And stay up late and maybe spoon
Just because I don't say anything doesn't mean I don't like you
No! I opened my mouth and I tried and I tried

And besides, you're probably holding hands
With some skinny, pretty girl that likes to talk about bands
And all I wanna do is ride bikes with you
And stay up late and watch cartoons

I'm just your average ThunderCats ho2Embed
