Lucky Number Nine Lyrics
Indie boys are neurotic
Makes my eyes bleed
Tight black pants, exotic
Some loving is what I need
But, hey, I'm startin' to feel okay
Lucky number nine, hooray

Sepia on the staircase
Mirror in the back of my brain
Makes these hard pants feel great
I used to like to complain
But, hey, I'm startin' to feel okay
Lucky number nine, hooray

Bloody Mary, mother of God
Grandpa's on the hobby horse again
Tamping, broken pants chaffing
I'm running out of ethnic friends
But, hey, I'm startin' to feel okay
Lucky number nine, hoorayEmbed
