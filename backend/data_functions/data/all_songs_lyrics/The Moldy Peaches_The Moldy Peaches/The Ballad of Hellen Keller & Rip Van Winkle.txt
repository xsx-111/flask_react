The Ballad of Hellen Keller & Rip Van Winkle LyricsBurn it all up
Hanging in the street
Enlightenment
Whining mercy me
Take my hand now love
Down the stairs your father walks
I will lead the way
His hair is falling gray
Leave them behind
Run into the sea
Don't make a sound
Twitching silently
Take my hand now love
Down the stairs your father walks
I will lead the way
His hair is falling gray
No matter what they say
I can make you stayEmbed
