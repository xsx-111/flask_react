On Top Lyrics
Just a cool cat in a small town (Small town)
Working my ass at a Waldbaum's (Waldbaum's)
Waiting to groove in a hip town (Hip town)
Get down
I'm waiting for the sound of a new town
Trying to avoid a little beat down (Beat down)
Of a white boy who thinks that he's down (He's down)
That's me
And I'm waiting to succeed

I might be just a little kid, but I know what rocks
Rap is out, The Moldy Peaches are at the top
We hate dance and we hate rap
But we like to contradict ourselves
And that's alright
I might be just a little kid, but I know what rocks
Rap is out, The Moldy Peaches are at the top
We hate dance and we hate rap
But we like to contradict ourselves
And that's alrightEmbed
