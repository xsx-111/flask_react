One Minute Man (Remix) Lyrics
Ooh, I don't want, I don't need, I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance, be a man, take my hand, understand
I don't want no minute man

Boy, I'ma make you love me, make you want me
And I'ma give you some attention tonight
Now follow my intuitions, what you wishin'
See, I'ma keep you all night for a long time
Just start countin' the ways

Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no

Tonight, I'ma give it to you, throw it to you
I want you to come prepared, oh yeah (Oh yes)
Boy, it's been a long time, a crazy long time
And I don't want no minute man, and that's real
Give it to me some more
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no (Fifty grand I get this all in one take, Hova)
Look, I'm not tryna give you love and affection
I'm tryna give you sixty seconds of perfection
I'm tryna give you cab fare and directions
Get your independent ass out of here, question
I'm not your man, not Ralph Tresvant
Not Ronnie Romance, no ma
I'm tryna hit you then quit you in the middle of the round
Like I'm Roberto Duran, no mas
Six AM, another chick in the house (Put your hands up)
6:15, another chick kicked out (Put your hands up)
Spent one minute tryna dig her out
The other fourteen tryna put it in her mouth
The dick too chubby, too much'll make you love me
Now be a nice wifey and run home to your hubby
'Cause we both knowin' what we doin' is wrong
Don't forget to put your ring back on
Ooh, I don't want, I don't need, I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance, be a man, take my hand, understand
I don't want no minute man

Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, break, break me off
Break, break me off, show me what you got
Break me off, show me what you got
Break me off, show me what you got
Break me off, show me what you got
Break me off, break, break me offEmbed
