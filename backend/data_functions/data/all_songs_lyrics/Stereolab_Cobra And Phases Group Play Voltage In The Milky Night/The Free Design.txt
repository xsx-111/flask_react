The Free Design LyricsWhere it had been left hundreds of years ago?
Extract from the depth is but a setting sun
Paradise is scarce in this light that won't shine
What is our earthly task but a worthy design?
Some held it in sight for scattered it may have been
They're ready to fight in a priceless inkling
The request is here ready to resurrect
What else can we do but recover the project
Our earthly design can be so detached
What crushes our desire not to be trapped?
When the higher spheres tell us to and not to
Everyone agrees demanding more veto
Our earthly design can we be so detached
What crushes our desire not to be trapped?Embed
