Puncture In The Radax Permutation LyricsLonely walker humanoid
Listening to forgotten sounds
Tasting smells and colours
Hiking mounts crossing rivers
Humble biped you've come undone
You detached the mechanical
Freedom it inspires
Fusing with your desire
Primal hiker lonely walker
Rediscovering your own pace
Left here to go elsewhere
Abandon all impatience
Reposess the senses
Impression of freedom
Time doesn't know itself
Has mingle path and dream
Animal survivor
You belong to nature
Reposess the senses
Impression of freedom
Time doesn't know itself
Has mingle path and dream
Animal survivor
You belong to nature
Reposess the senses
Impression of freedom
Time doesn't know itself
Has mingle path and dream
Animal survivor
You belong to nature
Dreams of return to nature
