Op Hop Detonation LyricsSuffer you little children
Remain passive and fearful
Suffer don't grow out of it
Revel, and let's celebrate
The poor love of this poor world
The sad love the vampire
Suffer you little children
Remain passive and fearful
Suffer don't grow out of it
Revel, and let's celebrate
The poor love of this poor world
The sad love the vampire
We who're young and beautiful
We who can stand up and walk
Our lives we will learn to control
We who're young and beautiful
Respond revolution when
We hear the word suffering
???? learn to control
We who're young and beautiful
Respond with revolution
When we hear the word suffering
We who're young and beautiful
We who can stand up and walk
Our lives we will learn to control
We who're young and beautiful
Respond revolution when
We hear the word sufferingEmbed
