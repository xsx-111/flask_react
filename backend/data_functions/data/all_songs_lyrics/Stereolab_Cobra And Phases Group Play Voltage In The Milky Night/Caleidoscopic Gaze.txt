Caleidoscopic Gaze LyricsAll the women who understand
How natural and good it is
To bare all clothes and bring the smile of knowledge
Try the freedom that comes with it
With a smile, trumpets and drums, the desire for meaning comes
With a smile, trumpets and drums, the desire for meaning comes
With a smile, trumpets and drums, the desire for meaning comes
With a smile, trumpets and drums, the desire for meaning comes
Roaring inside her woman and anger, roaring inside her woman and ire
Roaring inside her woman and anger, roaring inside her woman and ire
All the women who understand
How good it is
To bare all clothes and bring the smile, smile of knowledge
Try the freedom that comes with itEmbed
