Infinity Girl Lyrics
New realities are conditions
Much to little for us to suffer
Because we don't know any better
There are a hundred ways to fall in step

New realities are conditions
Much to little for us to suffer
Because we don't know any better
There are a hundred ways to fall in step

Because for the past two hundred years
The wine drunk and the freedom proclaimed
Oh, are dubious and laughable
Waiting to yield a new use of life

Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
A knife to cut the root, the root of ignorance
A knife to cut the root, the root of ignorance
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
New realities are conditions
Much to little for us to suffer
Because we don't know any better
There are a hundred ways to fall in step

Because for the past two hundred years
The wine drunk and the freedom proclaimed
Oh, are dubious and laughable
Waiting to yield a new use of lifeEmbed
