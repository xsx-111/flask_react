Blips, Drips And Strips LyricsI pick up by the handful
The somber heap at my feet
Eyes closed to see the hopeful
Trusting my deepest instinct
I pick up by the handful
The somber heap at my feet
Eyes closed to see the hopeful
Trusting my deepest instinct
But I go on
Dawning light
Task of hope
In a dawn light
Task of hope
These are stars
At last dare to raise my eyes
I saw the ship in the stars
Strong of glittering fleet
Bringing light to the new born
I pick up by the handful
The somber heap at my feet
Eyes closed to see the hopeful
Trusting my deepest instinct
At last dare to raise my eyes (But I go on)
I saw the ship in the stars (Task of hope)
Strong of glittering fleet (Dawning light)
Bringing light to the new bornEmbed
