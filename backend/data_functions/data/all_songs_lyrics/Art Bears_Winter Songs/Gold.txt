Gold LyricsI was born in the Earth
Out of fire and flood
Owned men mined me
And out of their lives all
My value derived
And out of their deaths
My authority
For
I am the shadow: Money
I come between;
Both time and persons I
Disconnect
I can transform
Anything into what
I am
And make men immortalEmbed
