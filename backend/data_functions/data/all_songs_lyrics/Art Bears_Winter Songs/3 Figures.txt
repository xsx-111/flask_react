3 Figures LyricsI shall lead, says the boy
And indeed he points the way
His feet precede him for he
Has not turned his head
I will come, only wait
Says the man –
Something calls
I shall stay, says the king
I remain
Unimpressed with the world
– let the world come to me
But he watches the boy
His heart heavy with
FearEmbed
