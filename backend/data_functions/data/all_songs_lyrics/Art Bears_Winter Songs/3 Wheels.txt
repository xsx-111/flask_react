3 Wheels LyricsThe double wheel
Of the sun
Rolls in the sky
Out step the days
I watch them
Wet and dry
Twice turning as
The months go by
Am I Ezekiel, sleeping
Do I dream this
Wheel
Revolving – a wheel
Within a wheel?
Or is it real?
A wheel which moves
And is unmoving;
Which is both
Being/ and
Becoming; which is
Both flow,/ arrested
Flow, decay/ and growth
A philosophic
Wheel – a wheel
Which is itself the
Passage from
NOT Knowing, into
KnowingEmbed
