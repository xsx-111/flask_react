Timing Lyrics
Drag your feet across the floor
Feeling so relieved
Turning up the thermostat to get a little heat
I could make a cup of coffee
I could make a cup of tea
If I feel like it

Plants are looking thirsty
Better have a little drink
Mind's a little foggy better clear it up today
Sipping, staring at a pile of dishes
Lying in the sink
Where I live at

Everything I think about is timing
Where it isn't what I do
Don't think I can handle this silence
Nothing here, oh what's the use
Feeling pretty dry in my eyelids
She'll be heading home in an hour or two

Beating up the pillows
Getting ready for the day
Tidy up a little
Put some water on my face
And it's past 11:30 and I know what I could say
When she gets here
Hold on, baby what did you say?
Looking so good
Please save me
Tell me, tell me
Honey you could feel good

Everything I think about is timing
Where it isn't what I do
Don't think I can handle this silence
Nothing here, oh what's the use
Feeling pretty dry in my eyelids
She'll be heading home in an hour or twoEmbed
