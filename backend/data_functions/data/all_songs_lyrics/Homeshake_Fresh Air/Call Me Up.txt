Call Me Up Lyrics
I can see the future, we'll be
Living it up inside
Making you feel alright
But I know
We got a little space between us
I know you want me too
And there's something we can do

Patiently she's sitting there thinking of what she's gonna do
All alone
Anytime you wanna just call me up, and I'll answer you
On the phone
Patiently she's sitting there thinking of what she's gonna do
All alone
Anytime you wanna just call me up, and I'll answer you
On the phone

I can feel the pain within you
It's turning your insides out
And filling you up with doubt
Don't you know
How prudent, and I need you feeling
Like you don't mean to pout
Saying that you know what I'm about
Patiently she's sitting there thinking of what she's gonna do
All alone
Anytime you wanna just call me up, and I'll answer you
On the phone
Patiently she's sitting there thinking of what she's gonna do
All alone
Anytime you wanna just call me up, and I'll answer you
On the phone3Embed
