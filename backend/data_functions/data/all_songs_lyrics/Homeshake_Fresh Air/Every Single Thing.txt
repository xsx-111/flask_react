Every Single Thing Lyrics
(Hey, are you even paying attention to me right now?)

Every single thing that I shouldn't do
Seems to come so natural
I don't know 'bout you
Feeling so out of touch
Staying inside too much
Introducing all these hands but I'm out of luck

Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you
Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you

Is there anything you need?
Make you feel more comfortable
Put your mind at ease
So what do I do instead?
While I think about every single thing
Running through my head
Keeping me inside

Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you
Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to

Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing14Embed
