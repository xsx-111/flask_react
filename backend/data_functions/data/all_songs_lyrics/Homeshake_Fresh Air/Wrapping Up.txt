Wrapping Up Lyrics
Kind of feeling that I can't ignore
Do my best to try to smoke it off
That's for sure
Only thing that's helping anymore
Only do it when I'm feeling warm
And I don't know if this is coming back
So I roll up, sip it, and I feel alright
I ain't looking for some company
Yeah, the bitch is hurting me
Please don't take it personally

Wrapping up my leaves
I'm a little out of ease
And I'll have to smoke tomorrow we will see

Walking, feeling so above it all
I'm so high you got a problem, ma?
Cool it off
Take my medicine, I'm coming down
Gunna be an extra gentle now
And I know everyone is coming back
So I roll up, sip it, and I feel alright
People make me feel uncomfortably
And it's only hurting me
Live it up so easily

Wrapping up my leaves
I'm a little out of ease
And I better take another day
Wrapping up my leaves
I'm a little out of ease
And I'll have to smoke tomorrow we'll see2Embed
