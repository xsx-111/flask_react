Serious Lyrics
You know he's serious
About the way he feels
So he's gonna take a few of those pills
To get serious
About the way he moves
He's been dreaming 'bout it for a while
Waiting to get down in his

Room
Trying to get loose
Life has no use
Mixing his juice

And he's serious
About the way he looks
But he hasn't got the money that he should
To be serious
About the cash he needs
To get high and buy a couple things
That'll make his shallow heart

Heal
Swear he'll pop those
People he knows
Trying to make dough
I know it's easier
Just to pack it up, pretend it ain't you
Don't I know it too?

You know he's serious
About the way he feels
So he's gonna take a few of those pills
To be serious
About the way he moves
Things that he might do if he had the hand of a loving, good

Man
Move it, don't stand
Do what you can
To get it all

I know what's easier
Just to pack it up, pretend it ain't you
Don't I know it too?2Embed
