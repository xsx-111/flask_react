Khmlwugh Lyrics
Something doesn't feel quite right
My lips are dry, my shoes are too tight

I feel weird
And I know I needed you
She shouldn't have to be
The one who's taking care of me
And that's

Kissing, hugging, making love and
Waking up and getting high
Kissing, hugging, making love and
Waking up and getting high

Guess I'll have a couple tonight
She's rolling one to pass the time

Til I'm home
She's waiting there alone
And it feels like it's the end
When everything falls in again
It's just
Kissing, hugging, making love and
Waking up and getting high
Kissing, hugging, making love and
Waking up and getting - I wanna get
Kissing, hugging, making love and
Waking up and getting high
Kissing, hugging, making love and
Waking up and getting

I know for sure
Everything that I feel is in your mind
It's yours
Only thing we can do is lay down on the floor
Passing it back and forth until it's out
And then
Sliding under the covers with our head
In our bed4Embed
