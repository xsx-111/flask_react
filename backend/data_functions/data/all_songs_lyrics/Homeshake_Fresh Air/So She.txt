So She Lyrics
So she's doing something I wouldn't do
Trying to be a better person, I guess
Doesn't like how it's been working out
Sick of asking people nicely
(Getting pretty dicey)

Been a while, yeah she's been talking about
Didn't matter something I can't believe
Won't be long till she'll be carrying
She'll be her, I'll be me, we'll be alone

So she says things she shouldn't say
'Bout some people she don't know in another place
Maybe it's the band, maybe TV
Maybe there's a little part of her dying to leave
Guess I'll give her space and let her be
Something I thought that her with I might never agree
If she wants maybe she'll gimme a call
Gotta leave it out or there'll be
Nothing to say at all

So she said, "Hey," I said, "Hey, what's up?"
How's it going? Oh, you know, pretty good
Trying to stay busy and get it right
Couple things I didn't mention
(Smoke release the tension)
I can feel the space between every word
And I bet you that she's feeling the same
Okay, well, I guess I'll be seeing you
Wishing we were speaking freely again
So she says things she shouldn't say
'Bout some people she don't know in another place
Maybe it's the band, maybe T.V
Maybe there's a little part of her dying to leave
Guess I'll give her space and let it be
Something I thought that her with I might never agree
If she wants maybe she'll gimme a call
Gotta leave it out or there'll be nothing to say at allEmbed
