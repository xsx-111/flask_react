Fresh Air Lyrics
Roll this, slip my shoes on and step outside
Roll my hands up into my sleeves
Reaching back and closing the door behind
Lift it up and pull it with ease
Trying to take a moment outside my screen
Trying to keep down out of the cloud
I can hear the traffic blow on the breeze
I can't figure anything out

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I pinch it for later on
Easy knowing when it's enough
I don't need anxiety, move along
This is gonna make it too much
Trying to pull together to keep this up
Trying to stack a couple more pills
I can hear the water pouring in my cup
I can do whatever I feel
(Whatever)

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
