Not U Lyrics
Wait a minute let me try and screw my head back on
Could have sworn it's been a minute now that I've been gone
Everybody's tossing bottles; making quite a scene
Yeah, I guess it's okay if you want to talk with me

How it could have been, doesn't matter now
What you would have seen, wasn't anyhow
It turned out in the end
And you wanted to be friends
But it doesn't matter what you do
Because I love her
Not you
Not you
Not you
Not you

Staring daggers like you think that it could change a thing
Like you hate it, like her being here drives you insane
Maybe you should take a walk and figure what to do
Hope that this'll be the last time that I hear from you

How it could have been, doesn't matter now
What you would have seen, wasn't anyhow
It turned out in the end
And you wanted to stay friends
But it doesn't matter what you do
Because I love her
Not youEmbed
