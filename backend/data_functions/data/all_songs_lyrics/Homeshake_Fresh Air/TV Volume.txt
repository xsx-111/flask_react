TV Volume Lyrics
Eyes are closed
I don't know
What her moving eyelids see
Deep inside so privately
(Like you do)

Light is low
So it won't
Pull her out from underneath
See me sitting patiently
(Like I do)

Move a bit
Light afflicts
Placid floating on a cloud
Turn the TV volume down
(Like I do)

Bends her knees
And she speaks
(No, no, no. Your hands are too cold)
Coming up on half past three
Almost see her look at me
(Like you do)2Embed
