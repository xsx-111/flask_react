This Way Lyrics
Come and sit and stay a while
You can relax, it's me
Laying out and sipping chamomile
So slow, waiting patiently
Trying to spend the day away
But everything comes up dry
I'm here so I can get it straight
So moved and I wonder why

'Cause love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?
Live this way?
'Cause love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?

What you wanna talk about?
Shadow a point you make
Let it in so I can let it out
So old, feeling out of shape
Use a couple of minds
Got it into my hand
Found the switch to get a little light
So bright I could get a tan
'Cause love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?
Live this way?
'Cause love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?
Live this way?

I can feel your energy
Empty out my memory
Sun doesn't clear my eyes
Maybe you'd be better off
Crashing every 
Starting 

Come and sit and stay a while
You can relax, it's me
Feeling slippers on the frozen tile
So cold, living comfortably
Trying to spend a pretty time
Tuning it out with you
Take a breath to empty out my mind
I'm here, what you wanna do?
'Cause love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?
Live this way?
Love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?
Live this way?

I can feel your energy
Empty out my memory
Sun doesn't clear my eyes
Maybe you'd be better off
Crashing every
