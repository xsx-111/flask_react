Chain Reaction LyricsElephant dominating Russian
Don't be running hurt
Elephant running
Dominating the deep
Chain reaction incoming when you get so small
I said chain reaction incoming when you get so rushed
Losing, marching
Urging, union
Chain, chain reaction
Dominating in the jungle
Domino, domino, domino
Domino, domino
Ladies know the woman
Elephant woman
Dominating ladies, Russian mistress
Domino, domino, domino
Confusion
All she wants
Chain reaction, chain reaction incoming when you get so small
Chain reaction, chain reaction incoming when it get's reversed
Chain reaction
Chain reaction, can't call it when it gets so much
Chain reaction, time reversed
Chain reaction, can't call it when it gets reversed
Chain reaction, can't call it when it's strange reversed
Chain reaction, can't call it when it gets so small
Domino, domino, domino, domino, domino, domino
Domino, domino, domino, domino, domino
Chain reaction, can't call it when it gets so smallEmbed
