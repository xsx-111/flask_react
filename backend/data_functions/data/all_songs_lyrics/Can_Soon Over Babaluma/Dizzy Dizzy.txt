Dizzy Dizzy LyricsIn the daydream, on a crusty chest
Head is slightly to one sound, head is curly and messy
Got to get it up, got to get it over
Got to get it up, got to get it over with
Got to get it up, got to get it over
Got to get it up, got to get it over with
Is the backing in bed?
Dizzy
I know, I don't smoke with the angels I know
Don't throw ashtrays at me
Throwing on you
Throwing on you, kiss, kiss
Throwing on you, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
Throwing on you
Don't rat-a-tat-a-tat-a-tat in the daydream on a crusty chest
Head is slightly to one sound, head is curly and messing
Got to get it up, got to get it over, over
Got to get it up, got to get it over, over
Got to get it up
Got to get it up
Got to get it up, got to get it over
Got to get it up
Got to get it up, got to get it over
I'm not made out of moonshine
I'm not made out of moonshine
I'm not made out of moonshine
But I'm something out of the heart
Throwing on you, kiss, kiss
Throwing on you, dizzy, dizzy
Throwing on you, dizzy, dizzy
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
Dizzy, dizzy
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
Dizzy, dizzy
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzyEmbed
