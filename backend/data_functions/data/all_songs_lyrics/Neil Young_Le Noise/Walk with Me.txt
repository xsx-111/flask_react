Walk with Me Lyrics
I feel your love
I feel your strong love
I feel the patience among conditional love
I feel a strength
I feel your faith in me
I'll never let you down no matter what you do
If you just walk with me and let me walk with you
I'm on this journey I don't wanna walk alone
Walk with me
Walk with me
Shine me a light
Walk with me
I lost some people I was traveling with
I missed a soul in the old friendshipEmbed
