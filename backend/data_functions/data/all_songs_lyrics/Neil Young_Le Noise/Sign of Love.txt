Sign of Love Lyrics
When we go for a little walk
Out on the land
When we're just walking and holding hands
You can take it as a sign of love
When the winds of fate
Keep blowing and we both understand

Sign of love
It's a sign of love
Sign of love

When we both have silver hair
And a little less time
But there still are roses on the vine
You can take it as a sign of love
When I look at you
When I'm looking at you for a long, long time


When I first saw you
You were just a girl
And I was a man
While the music played
I watched you dance
