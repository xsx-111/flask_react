Spring Hall Convert LyricsSo I woke up in a radio freeze
Occupied by a couple of girls
I knew from way back
When, where
Oh, I had my face like the ocean
So I'd radiate but
Too much radiation
I walk around like a walker
Always choosing where to go
And where to be
Oh, radiation
Oh, radiation
Oh, so long
Oh, so long, so long
So long loneliness, so long loneliness
So long loneliness, so long, so long
So long, yeah, so long, yeah
So long, yeah, so long
So far from home, so far from home
So far from home, so far from homeEmbed
