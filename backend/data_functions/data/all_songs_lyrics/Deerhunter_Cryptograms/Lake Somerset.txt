Lake Somerset LyricsIt pays to kill anyone who has information
In the park we hide behind rocks
We urinate on rocks until the sun comes up
Encrypted in flesh, concrete soaked in sweat
We lived in Lake Somerset
It was south of Dallas Highway, just east of a drained lake
Orchids dissolve, equations solved, psychic landscape
To know there is a limit to what you can experience
These walls I know, I grew up here
No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfactionEmbed
