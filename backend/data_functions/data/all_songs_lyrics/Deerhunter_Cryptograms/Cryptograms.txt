Cryptograms LyricsMy greatest fear I fantasized
The days were long, the weeks flew by
Before I knew I was awake
My days were through, it was too late
My greatest fear I organized
Into something more realized
And now what's left I get to spend
Knowing that it's about to end
My greatest fear I can't decode
A cryptogram whose seeds weren't sewn
My last few months I arose out
My vision blurred, there was no sound
There was no sound, there was no sound1Embed
