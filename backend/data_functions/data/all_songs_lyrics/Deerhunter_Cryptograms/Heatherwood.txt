Heatherwood LyricsIn the beginning the world was a map
Out through the back door and into the trap
Home is an echo reflecting a place
I disappeared then and without a trace
I was arranged to leave on that day
There were complications, I've chosen to stay
I saw the curtains and it was the end
When one life is over a new one begins
When one life is over a new one begins
When one life is over a new one begins
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen againEmbed
