Strange Lights LyricsWhat direction should we choose?
We're lost and still confused
I walk into the sun
With you, the only one
Who understood the ways
The hours become days
The weeks turn into months
We walk into the sun
So glad to have a guide
Less lonely for the ride
And should this car ascend
At least I'm with a friend
In space all things are slow
No sound with speakers blown
The silence fits the scene
The prince is now the king
We walk into the sun
We walk but cannot run
Because walking's half the fun
We walk into the sun
And neon blurs my sight
I'm guided by strange lights
And I'm rattled and I'm stunned
As I walk into the sunEmbed
