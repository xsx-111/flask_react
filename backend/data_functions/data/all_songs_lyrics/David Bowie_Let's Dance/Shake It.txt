Shake It Lyrics
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)

I feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me?

(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well

(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Sitting on a flagstone, talking to a faceless girl
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Been wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well

Duck and I sway (what's my line?)
I shoot at a full moon (what's my line?)
So what's my line?
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, ooh
'Cause love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'd fight for you
You're better than money

(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
When I'm feeling disconnected, well, I sure know what to do
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)

Shake it, shake it, baby
Oh, shake it, shake it

I duck and I sway (what's my line?)
I shoot at a full moon (what's my line?)
So what's my line?

Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it (whoa!)
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)2Embed
