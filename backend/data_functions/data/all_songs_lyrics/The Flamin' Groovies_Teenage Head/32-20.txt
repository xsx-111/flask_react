32-20 LyricsI got a 32-20, baby, built on a .45 frame
I got a 32-20, baby, built on a .45 frame
I'm gonna ventilate my woman if I catch her with another man
I'm gonna cock my hammer, gonna squeeze that trigger so tight
I'm gonna cock my hammer, gonna squeeze that trigger so tight
I got a puzzle for you, baby, 'cause I hear you're runnin' 'round at night
Break it down
Well, you know I'm loaded, baby, and it's all for you
Yes, you know I'm loaded, baby, and it's all for you
I got a 32-20, gonna learn you to be true
This is splendid, ain't it? 
Yeah, I got a 32-20, baby, built on a .45 frame
I got a 32-20, baby, built on a .45 frame
If you look down the barrel, send you back to where you came
Awww
