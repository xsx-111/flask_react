Teenage Head LyricsI'm a monster
Got a revved-up teenage head
Teenage monster
California born and bred
Half a boy and half a man
I'm half at sea and half on land, oh my
Bye-bye
Got a woman
She's my hopped-up high-school queen
She's my woman
She's a teenage love machine
She knows how to turn me on
And get me high and get it on and on
Yeah, she does
When you see me
Better turn your tail and run
'Cause I'm angry
And I'll mess you up for fun
I'm a child of atom bombs
And rotten air and Vietnams, I'm you
You are meEmbed
