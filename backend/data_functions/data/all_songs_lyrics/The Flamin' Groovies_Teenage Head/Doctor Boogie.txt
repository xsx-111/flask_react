Doctor Boogie LyricsYeah, my man
Well, hey little bobble  with big green eyes
I'd like to take you home and try you on for size
You gotta hey-dee hey, you gotta hey-dee hey
You got to hey-dee hey if you wanna get along with me
Well, sweet little babe, the way you look so fine
But to be my woman, got to walk the line
You got to mow the lawn, you got to mow the lawn
You got to mow the lawn if you wanna get along with me
Mow the lawn!
Ooooh-ooh (Mow, mow)
Well, I boogie for the doctor, and I boogie for the nurse
I'm gonna keep on boogyin' till they throw me in a hearse
I got to boogie on, I got to boogie on
A boogie disease
Tell me all about it
Whoo
Whoooo-whoo
Well, you boogie with your doctor till the break of dawn
You can bend right there, we keep a-rockin' on 
You gotta walk your dog, you gotta walk your dog
You gotta walk your dog if you wanna get along with me
You gotta hey-dee hey (You gotta hey-dee hey)
You gotta hey-dee hey (You gotta hey-dee hey)
You gotta hey-dee hey (You gotta hey-dee hey)
You gotta hey-dee hey (You gotta hey-dee hey)
You gotta hey-dee hey, you gotta hey-dee hey, you gotta hey-dee hey
You gotta hey-dee hey
You got to hey-dee hey
You got to hey-dee hey . . Embed
