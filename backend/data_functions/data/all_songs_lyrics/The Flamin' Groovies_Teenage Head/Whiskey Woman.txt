Whiskey Woman LyricsI've been hungry all day long
For that girl who’s wastin' time
She was here but now she's gone
I’ve got a taste for wine
Whiskey Woman why can't you
See the hell you put me through
We got to? the best in you
As I sit and write this song
You're the one thing on my mind
We've been lovers far too long
The good times were passin' by
Whiskey Woman???
Locked me in her womanhood
Like I always knew she would
Yeah
Whiskey Woman I want you
Come on
I want you
Whiskey Woman, where are you
Where, where are you
I want you
Where are you2Embed
