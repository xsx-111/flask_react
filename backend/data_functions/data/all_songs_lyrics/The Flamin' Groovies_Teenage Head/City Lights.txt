City Lights LyricsBelieve I'll go down to the city
Where the neon lights all shine so bright and pretty
Where the night-time girls are always laughin'
Movie stars are authographin' there
There's so much I wanna see
Buy myself a store-bought suit and a Stetson
And a big fur coat so the winter never gets in
Take myself down to the station
Ask the girl for information
'Bout my trip for N.Y.C
Yeah
Got to see the empire's tallest buildin'
Where the plane shot that big monkey, and they killed him
But I'm a fool to go on wishin'
Might as well go on with my fishin'
Oh Lord, I wish I was free
City lights keeps callin' me
Tellin' me to leave my country home
Leave my home
Leave my home
Aw, leave my home
Gotta leave my home
(Talkin' 'bout) Leave my home
(Leave my home)Embed
