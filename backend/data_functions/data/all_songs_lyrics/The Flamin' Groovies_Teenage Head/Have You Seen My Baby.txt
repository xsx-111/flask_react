Have You Seen My Baby LyricsHave you seen my baby, on the avenue?
You know she's drivin me crazy
With the funny things she do
I seen her with the milkman
Drivin down the street
When you're through with my baby, milkman
Send her home to me
Hold on, Hold on, Hold on
Hold on, Hold on, Hold on
You know it's been so long
Since she has been gone
So hold on, hold on, hold on
I seen her with the gypsies
Dancin' in the wood
She always been unfaithful to me
And never been no good
I said, "Please don't talk to strangers, baby"
But she always do
She said "I talk to strangers, if I wanna
I'm a stranger too."
Hold on, Hold on, Hold on
Woo!
Hold on, Hold on, Hold on
You know it's been so long
Since she has been gone
So hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
AlrightEmbed
