Tomorrow Will Be Like Today LyricsThrew a wire out
Through the love of a sudden kind
Never used to have to question all of the littlest thoughts
That go on in my mind
Never choose to be chosen
It's only for some to believe
I don't care about nothing
When it's you and me
Then I hear you say
Tomorrow will be like today
In the scheme of everything
How could I just get stuck
On one thing at a time
All the wild winds blow all around me
I'm still pretending that time won't go by
All the bread is not broken
And the wine is yet to be
I don't care about nothing
When it's you and me
Then I hear you say
Tomorrow will be like today
Threw a wire out
Through the love of a sudden kind
Never used to have to question all of the little starts
That go on in my mind
And the world is spinning
Round and round
I heard it used to be a new idea
I don't care about nothing
When you're here
And I hear you say
Tomorrow will be like todayEmbed
