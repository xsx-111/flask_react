Smile Please Lyrics
A smiling face is an Earth-like star
A frown can't bring out the beauty that you are
Love within, and you'll begin smiling
There are brighter days ahead
Don't mess your face up with bitter tears
'Cause life is gonna be what it is
It's okay, please don't delay from smiling
There are brighter days ahead

Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti bum
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti bum

A smiling face you don't have to see
'Cause it's as joyful as a Christmas tree
Love within and you'll begin smiling
There are brighter days ahead
Love's not competing; it's on your side
You're in life's picture, so why must you cry?
So for a friend, please begin to smile, please
There are brighter days ahead, oh oh...
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti bum
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti bum
(Please smile for me)
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum1Embed
