Bird Of Beauty Lyrics
Simon says that now your mind desires a vacation
Free to join in fun and plenty of recreation
There awaits you a ticket
At "Please Have A Good Time" Station, yeah
'Cause what is, is gonna stay
'Til ole Father Time decides to change
Simon says that your mind is requesting furlough
Let it find the answers to things
That you've always wanted to know
There's a tour of many places
That you've always wanted to go, yeah
And to me that sure sounds best
'Cause it means happiness for you

There is so much in life for you to feel
Unfound in white, red, or yellow pills
A mind excursion can be such a thrill
You please satisfy
Take a chance and ride
The bird of beauty of the sky

Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
Tudo bem voce deve descansar a sua mente
Nao faz mal o qu vai acontecer daqui pra fente
Vai cantar alegri
Voce coracao assim tao feliz ja vai cantar carnaval

There is so much in life for you to feel
Unfound in white, red, or yellow pills
A mind excursion can be such a thrill
You please satisfy
Take a chance and ride
The bird of beauty of the sky

Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
(Bird of beauty of the sky)
Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
(Bird of beauty of the sky)
Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
(Beauty of the sky...bird of beauty of the sky)2Embed
