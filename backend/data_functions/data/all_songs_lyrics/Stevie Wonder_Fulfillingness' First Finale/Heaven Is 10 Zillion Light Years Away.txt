Heaven Is 10 Zillion Light Years Away Lyrics
They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
And just the pure at heart will walk her righteous streets someday
They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
But if there is a God, we need Him now
"where is your God?"
That's what my friends ask me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come

Tell me, people
Why can't they say that hate is 10 zillion light years away?
Why can't the light of good shine God's love in every soul?
Why must my color black make me a lesser man?
I thought this world was made for every man
He loves us all, that's what my God tells me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come

But in my heart I can feel it, yeah
Feel His spirit, whoa whoa, whoa
Feel it, yeah, feel His spirit

I... can't say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
But if so let all be pure at heart
Just to walk her righteous streets I pray
Let God's love shine within to save our evil souls
For those who don't believe will never see the light
"where is my God" - He lives inside of me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come
People, "Where is your God?" â€” inside, please let Him be
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come
But if you open your heart you can feel it, yeah yeah
Feel His spirit whoa whoa, whoa
Feel it, yeah, you can feel His spirit
I opened my heart one morning and
I sho nuff could feel it, yeah yeah
Feel His spirit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can feel it, yeah, feel His spirit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can feel it, yeah...Embed
