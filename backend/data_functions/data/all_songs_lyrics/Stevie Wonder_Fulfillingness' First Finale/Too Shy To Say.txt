Too Shy To Say Lyrics
You make me smile
You make me sing
You make me feel good everything
You bring me up
When I've been down
This only happens when you're around

And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you

I want to fly
Away with you
Until there's nothing more for us to do
I want to be
More than a friend
Until the end of an endless end

And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you
And I can't go on this way
Feeling stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you
Ooh, ooh, I do1Embed
