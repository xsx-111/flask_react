Look Away LyricsI saw her standing there
Tears upon her cheek told me something was wrong
I asked her what it was
She looked away and said my daddy's home
I knew what that meant
It meant that I could never see her again
I had seen this once before
I didn't wanna deal with it anymore
Look away she said, as she turned to me
And when I tried to hold her
I couldn't let her be
Let her be, Let her be
I said why, why do you make me cry
She said I love you so
Look away I don't wanna know
I saw her standing there
Tears upon her cheek told me something's wrong
I said what baby
She looked away and said my daddy's home
Look away she said, and she turned to me
But God I, oh I loved her
Couldn't let her be
Let her be, Let her be
Look away, look away
She said I love you so
Look awayEmbed
