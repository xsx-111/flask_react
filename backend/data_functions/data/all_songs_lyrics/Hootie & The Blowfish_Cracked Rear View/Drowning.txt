Drowning LyricsTrouble with the world is we're too busy to think about it, all right
Why is there a rebel flag hanging from the state house walls?
Tired of hearin' this shit about heritage not hate
Time to make the world a better place
Why must we hate one another?
Well no matter what, we gotta live together
Just 'cause you don't look like me; tell me, what do you see?
When we pass on the street, what do you wanna see?
P.E.'s coming is all I gotta say
Wanna turn and run away
They're just telling you how they see it
Right or wrong, they don't care; you wish that they would quit
Drowning, in a sea of tears
Hatred, trying to hide your fears
Living, only for yourself
Hating, everybody else 'cause they don't look like you
Nanci singing it's a hard life wherever you go
About some fat racist living in Chicago
Trying to teach his kids to hate everyone
Well tell me, why is that something you wanna teach your son?
Why must we hate one another?
When the people in the church, they tell me you're my brother
You don't walk like me, said you don't talk like me
Saying "Go back to Africa," I just don't understand
Drowning, in a sea of tears
Hatred, trying to hide your fears
Living, only for yourself
Hating, everybody else 'cause they don't look like you
Not like you
(Drowning...)
Yeah, I'm trying to be someone that he could look up to but
When I walk down the street, tell me what do you see?
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man
No, I'm not like you; why do you hate me so?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Hating, everybody else 'cause they don't look like you
Oh, drowning
Hating, everybody else 'cause they don't look like you
