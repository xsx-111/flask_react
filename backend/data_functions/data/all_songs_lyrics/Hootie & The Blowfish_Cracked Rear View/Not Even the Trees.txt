Not Even the Trees LyricsAlone as I sit and watch the trees
Won't you tell me if I scream, will they bend down and listen to me?
And it makes me wonder... if I know the words, will you come?
Or will you laugh at me?
Or will I run?
Little boy says to me, "Where you goin' now son?"
I said, "I don't know where I'm goin', boy, I only know where I'm from"
And it makes me wonder... if the stars shine when my eyes close
Or does my brother's heart cry?
I don't know
I'm a stranger in my home
Now that everybody's gone
Someone please talk to me 'cause I feel you cry
And you're sitting with him
And I know I'll never see you again
Lying down in Charleston under the Carolina sky
You see I'm tired of feeling this pain; I'm tired of living my own little lie
And it makes me wonder... when I see you in my dreams
Does it mean anything?
Are you trying to talk to me?
I'm a stranger in my home
Tell me, are you feeling alone?
Someone tell me what to do 'cause I'm feeling strong
And I wonder how you feel
Do you realize my pain is for real?
I see you in my dreams
And I wonder if you're looking down at me and smiling right now
I wanna know if it's true
When he looks at me, won't you tell me
Does he realize he came down here and he took you too soon?
And now my days are short and my nights are long
I lay down with memories of you that keep me going on, going on
And it makes me wonder... as I sit and stare
Will I see your face again?
Tell me, do you care?
I'm a stranger in my home
Living life on my own
Right now I just can't see 'cause I'm feeling weak
And my soul begins to bleed
And no one's listening to me, not even the treesEmbed
