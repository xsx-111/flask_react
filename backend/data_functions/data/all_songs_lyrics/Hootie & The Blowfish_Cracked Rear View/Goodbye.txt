Goodbye Lyrics
Tomorrow used to be a day away
Now love is gone and you're into someone far away
I never thought the day would come
When I would see his hand, not mine, holding on to yours
Because I could not find the time

And now I can't deny 'nothing lasts forever'
But I don't want to leave and see the teardrops in your eyes
I don't want to live to see the day we say goodbye

Now there comes another part of life I call 'alone'
Sitting at a bar with Chris that I can't leave
'Cause my house ain't no home, no
I just want to touch you, girl, I want to feel you close to me
Without your love, I would give up now and walk away so easily

So, maybe, while we're young, we'll figure out together
That, even with the pain, there's a remedy and we'll be alright
I don't want to live to see the day we say goodbye

When I first met you, I couldn't love anyone
Oh, but you stole my dreams and you made me see
That I can walk into the sun and I can still be me
And now I can't deny 'nothing lasts forever'
But I don't want to leave and see the teardrops in your eyes
So, maybe, while we're young, let's figure out together
That, even with the pain, there is a remedy and we'll be alright
I don't want to live to see the day we say goodbye
We say goodbye
Oh, goodbye
