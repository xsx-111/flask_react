Running From an Angel LyricsDon't look a gift horse in the mouth
Come on try and tell me what you're talkin about
Those things you're dealing with, you're living a lie
Every time I see you it makes me wanna cry
Sometimes we'd laugh and talk, seems like yesterday
Then you let the white horse come and take you away
They came to get you, it was cold and black
The wheels were in motion, there was no turning back
Running from an angel
Running to the devil, devil, yeah
Running from an angel
Running to the devil
I gave up on you a long time ago
But there's something I want you to know
Your lying and cheating really tore us apart
Please don't come home if you're gonna break my momma's heart
Running from an angel
Running to the devil, devil, yeah
Running from an angel
Running to the devil
Running, running, running
Don't make me cry again, no no
I'm trying to say goodbye
Oh God, you make me cry
You're running, you're running
You're running, running, running, running...
Running from an angel
Running to the devil, devil, devil, devil
Running from an angel
I'm trying to say goodbye
Darling you make me cry, oh no
Go do what you gotta do
I still love you
Running, running, running, running...Embed
