Hannah Jane LyricsYou got your big girls
Now you have your young one too
Wondering if some day I could have them
The way I once had you
I remember your crazy remarks
We'd get drunk and go out after dark
Searching for someone we could take home
(You don't wanna be alone
You don't want to see the sun go down
You don't wanna open the door)
And see her go
(One step and tomorrow comes)
It's tomorrow
(Two steps and she's off with someone)
There she goes
(Three steps and it's all you know)
You'll be gone
(You'll be gone, she'll be gone)
So what are you gonna do about me?
I'll be there when you have no one else
Spotted the ocean in the south's holy land
I'll be there, be your friend
Hold on strong, don't let go
There will never be no one to take your place
So don't you want to reach out and take my hand?
(You don't wanna be alone)
No, no, no
(You don't want to see the sun go down
You don't wanna open the door)
And see her go
(One step and tomorrow comes)
It's tomorrow
(Two steps and she's off with someone)
There she goes
(Three steps and it's all you know)
All you know, you'll be gone
(You'll be gone)
She'll be...
(She'll be gone)
She'll be gone, yeah
Ah...
(You don't wanna be alone)
No, no, no
(You don't want to see the sun go down)
See the sun go down
(You don't wanna open the door)
Open the door
See her go, see her go, no no
(One step and tomorrow comes)
It's tomorrow
(Two steps and she's off with someone)
There she goes
(Three steps and it's all you know)
You'll be gone
(You'll be gone)
She'll be gone
(She'll be gone
One step and tomorrow comes)
It's tomorrow
(Two steps and she's off with someone)
There she goes
(Three steps and it's all you know)
You'll be gone
(You'll be gone)
She'll be gone
(She'll be gone.)Embed
