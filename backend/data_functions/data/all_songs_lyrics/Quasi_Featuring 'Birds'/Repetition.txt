Repetition LyricsFlail me - I desire to be flailed -
Jail me, impale me
Brain me - what's the use of a brain?
Maim me, chain me...
Why do you hurt me?
You asked for it!
Oh, well I guess I regret that now
Flail me - I desire to be flailed -
Jail me, impale me
Brain me - what's the use of a brain?
Maim me, chain me...
Why do you hurt me?
You asked for it!
Oh, well I guess I regret that now
Flail me again, etc., ad infinitum...Embed
