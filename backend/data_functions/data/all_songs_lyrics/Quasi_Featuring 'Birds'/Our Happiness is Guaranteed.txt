Our Happiness is Guaranteed LyricsOrbiting pods, underwater domes
We fill our tanks with oxygen to step outside our homes
Once it was hard, now it's just routine
And I can't tell the difference between people and machine
Love was a problem for our ancestors;
It's not such a problem anymore
Breeding as a science proved it has no use at all
And it mostly disappeared when we eliminated war
There's comfort and control, it's safe for you and me
News from the surface shows how hard life there can be
Why live in danger? Why live with pain?
People from the surface find it hard to explain
And every little thing is strictly monitored;
We're given everything we need
Fed by I.V., we rarely need to sleep
There's no pointless dreaming and our happiness is guaranteedEmbed
