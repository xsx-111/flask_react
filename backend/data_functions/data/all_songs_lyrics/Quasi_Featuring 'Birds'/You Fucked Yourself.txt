You Fucked Yourself LyricsYou fucked yourself and you don't know where to go
Split wide open like a sturgeon for the roe
Blood red splashed on pure white snow, oh no
You fucked yourself and you're looking for the goat
Drowned if you sink, condemned if you float
You placed the blame but missed the boat
You fucked yourself; you chose your fate
You changed your mind when it's too late
Self-deceit is your worst mistakeEmbed
