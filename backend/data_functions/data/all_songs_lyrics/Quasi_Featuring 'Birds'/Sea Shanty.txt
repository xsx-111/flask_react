Sea Shanty LyricsRepair the hull, replace the sails
The monkey wrestles with the ghost
And a thousand little pleasures form a thin veneer
Over lack of hope
The captain was rightly murdered by the crew
But now they don't know what to do
Drifting on the murky Sargasso of the everyday
Work and slave and skimp and save
And you can buy yourself a bigger cage
And a thousand little cruelties we agree to pretend to ignore
The ghost has got the monkey by the tail
And all they both can do is wail
And you and I go drifting by the abandoned vessels of the everydayEmbed
