The Happy Prole Lyrics
Everday
We earn our meager pay
But it takes its toll
To play the happy prole

They buy your labor
Try to steal your soul
Bite the bullet
Hold your tongue
And play the happy prole

Paranoid and tired
Quit before you're fired
But they've got you in the hole
So you play the happy prole

You need the money
So you've got to play it dumb
But if you play it long enough
It's just what you'll become

Pay your rent
Pay your bills
Pay the doctor for your pills
So you can work another day
As life slips awayEmbed
