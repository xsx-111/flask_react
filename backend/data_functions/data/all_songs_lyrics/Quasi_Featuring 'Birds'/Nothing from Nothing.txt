Nothing from Nothing LyricsYou can be so heartless; I can be heartless too
And we can wound each other - isn't that what people do?
You can't be betrayed when there's nothing to betray
You can't throw it all away if there's nothing there anyway
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing, nothing, nothingEmbed
