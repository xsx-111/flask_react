I Never Want to See You Again Lyrics

I know the aether can never claim the Earth
Atmospheric gasses cannot remain with dirt
We purchase pleasure, pay for it with hurt
And we rarely get our money's worth

See how we grasp at the stars?
They're so far away, you can't even see what's right in front of you
Flesh wounds heal, broken bones mend
But you're not my friend
I never want to see you again


I never want to see you again
I never want to see you again
