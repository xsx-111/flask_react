The Poisoned Well Lyrics"You only hurt the one you love."
That may be true, but better said:
"You only hurt the one who loves you."
We went through hell just to get to hell -
Die of thirst or drink up from the poisoned well
If I kept things inside, at least I never lied
I'm not trying to document my suicide
You won't live long, but you may write the perfect song;
Please excuse those who choose to not play alongEmbed
