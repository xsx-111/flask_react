Metal Baby Lyrics
Metal baby
I met her, baby
I'm her mother and she's got me on the run
Metal baby
My metal baby
Got her finger 'round the trigger of her gun

I'm not the sort of person she'll admit she knows
She's not the sort of person that's driven white as snow

Metal baby
My metal baby
Made me take her to the heavy metal show
Metal baby
My metal baby
Drank her perfume when I didn't want to go

I'm not the sort of person she'll admit she knows
She's not the sort of person that's driven white as snow

Metal baby
My metal baby
I'm not ready to be party to her plan
Metal baby
My metal baby
Left the city with the heavy metal band
I'm not the sort of person she'll admit she knows
She's not the sort of person that's driven white as snow, soEmbed
