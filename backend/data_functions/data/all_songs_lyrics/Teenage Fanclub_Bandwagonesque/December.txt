December Lyrics
I'll take this chance
To tell my friends
What I'm thinking of
On second thought
I'll think some more
And tell you later on

She don't even care
But I would die for her love

My mind is full
Of several things
Resembling a thought
I'll take this chance
To tell my friends
What I'm thinking of

She don't even care
But I would die for her love

I've had this plan
For many years
But now I can't remember
I wanted to assassinate December
I wanted to assassinate DecemberEmbed
