Alcoholiday Lyrics
There are things I want to do
But I don't know if they will be with you
If they will be with you
There are things I want to say
But I don't know if they will be to you
If they will be to you

Listen, ever get a feeling when you're taken by the hand
And led a torch you can't command?
Went to bed, but I'm not ready
Baby, I've been fucked already
Falling into line, but I'm doing nothing
We've got nothing worth discussing
Went to go, but it's all hazy
People say I'm going crazy

There are things I want to do
But I don't know if they will be with you
If they will be with you
There are things I want to say
But I don't know if they will be to you
If they will be to you
Listen, ever get a feeling when you're taken by the hand
And led a torch you can't command?
Went to bed, but I'm not ready
Baby, I've been fucked already
Falling into line, but I'm doing nothing
We've got nothing worth discussing
Went to go, but it's all hazy
People say I'm going crazy

All I know is all I know
What I've done I leave behind me
I don't want my soul to find me
All I know is all I know
What I've done I leave behind me
I don't want my soul to find me
All I know is all I know
What I've done I leave behind me
I don't want my soul to find meEmbed
