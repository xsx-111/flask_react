Star Sign Lyrics
Hey, there's a horseshoe on my door
Big deal
And say, there's a black cat on the floor
Big deal

If these things make your day
Well, if these things change your day

Well, do you know where you belong?
And is your star sign ever wrong?

If these things change your day
Well, if these things make your day
Seen it all before, seen it all before
Given time, these things will change

Hey, there's a side of me unknown
Big deal
And say, should this unknown force be shown?
Big deal
If these thoughts make your day
Well, if these thoughts change your day
Seen it all before, seen it all before
Given time, these things will change
Seen it all before, seen it all before
Given time, these things will change
If these things change your day
Well, if this song makes your day
Seen it all before, seen it all before
Given time, these things will change
Seen it all before, seen it all before
Given time, these things will change1Embed
