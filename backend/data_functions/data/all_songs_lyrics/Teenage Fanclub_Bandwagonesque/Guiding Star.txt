Guiding Star Lyrics
When everything you own is lost
And every friendship has its cost
Your rolling stone has gathered moss
And all your clouds cover the sun
And all your karma has undone
Remember you're my number one

Hey!
You're my guiding star
I do know who you are
You're my guiding star

Don't you think you've heard this song before?
Jesus Christ was knocking at my door
Kinda like the way he wears his hair
Kinda like the way he walks on air
Could his golden halo
Be the sun we all know?Embed
