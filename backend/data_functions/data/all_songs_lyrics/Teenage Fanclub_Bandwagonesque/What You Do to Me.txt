What You Do to Me Lyrics
What you do to me
I know, I can't believe
There's something about you
Got me down on my knees
What you do to me
I know, I can't believe
There's something about you
Got me down on my knees

What you do to me
What you do to me
What you do to me
What you do to me

What you do to me
I know, I can't believe
There's something about you
Got me down on my knees
What you do to me
I know, I can't believe
There's something about you
Got me down on my knees
What you do to me
What you do to me
What you do to me
What you do to me
What you do to me
What you do to me
What you do to me
What you do to meEmbed
