Sidewinder Lyrics
Saw you there with long blonde hair
Eyes of blue, oh, baby, I love you
When you're walking (I love your walk)
When you're talking (I love your talk)
Look so cute behind your kit
I've heard some songs, but, baby, you're a hit
When you're rocking (I love your rock)
When you're ticking (I'm your tock)

But then again, you're just a thought
You think I'm lying, but I'm not

I love your touch, I love your style
Hit the snare, you know it makes me smile
When you're walking (I love your walk)
When you're talking (I love your talk)
I love you, but you can't see?
I love you, but, baby, do you love me?
When you're rocking (I love your rock)
When you're ticking (I'm your tock)

Then again, you're just a thought
You think I'm lying, but I'm not
(I love your walk)
(I love your talk)
(I love your walk)
(I love your talk)

Then again, you're just a thought
You think I'm lying, but I'm notEmbed
