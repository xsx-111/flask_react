The Concept Lyrics
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Still, she won't be forced against her will
Says she don't do drugs, but she does the pill
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah
I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah

Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
When she's at the gig, she takes her car
And she'll drive us home if there isn't a bar
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah
I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah

I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah
I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah
