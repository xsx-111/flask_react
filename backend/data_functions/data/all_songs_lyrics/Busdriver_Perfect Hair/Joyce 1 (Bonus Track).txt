Joyce 1 (Bonus Track) Lyrics
Looking up a sec
What kind of love is this
Looking up
What kind of love is this
Yo
Looking up a sec
What kind of love is this
Hellfyre
Looking up
Go
Looking up a sec
What kind of love is this
Yeah
Looking up
Yeah

Y'all got sick of my omnipresence
On my electronic press kit
And now I keep my body pressed against
You later and give it a sloppy wet kiss
Still I liked her so I copy pressed print
When they led us to the body to bench press
But amongst all of those 90s sex nips
A popular com was Cosby or Fresh Prince
In the 90s
In the 90s
What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich
What kind of love is this (what kind of love is this)
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich
What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich
What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich
What kind of love is this
What kind of love is this
What kind of love is this

I used to kick it at a Miller's Outpost
Would write insufferable tales or tally jokes
The reaper sighted at the Tim album roast
This is where we used to live and how spokes
Looked before I been pricked out alone
I fell from grace but the dismount was dope
My other homies angles or they milquetoast
Complaining that they're killed for meal soaked
But I hopped on that transatlantic flight
They should support us I'm a hand, sale, and sight
Put some songs on a bandcamp site
Now I'm paid like transplant eyes
For y'all I ain't got my tears to waste
You laid out some side bearing wake
But white homies with a Guy Pearce face
Making music that's five years late
Me meeting fish on the high seas with spicy sauce
Serving rappers acting all feisty
Over a nice sea of crops
I don't give a fuck if you some white weed
With a siamese dog
Paying crimes' fees
At a Chinese mosque
How political figures'll make a high priest dry heave cough
You love still that we off
You love still that we off
Yeah
You don't deserve this love
I want it all
You don't deserve this love
I want it all
You don't deserve this love

What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich
What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich
What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich
What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich

Let's brainwash the general masses
And treat all labels like a medical practice
I feel like taking the hypocratic oath
To where I doctor these rich anecdotes
I tell my peeps I got the Hispanic vote
Like I'm really tryna be a congressman
I realign myself but about a trend
Nigga I just need love like a primadonna
Imma roll weary worry warts
Speaking in some eerie slurred snorts
I believe that my kind will be sentenced
To death by the superior court
So fuck with ya boy
(Fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
(Fuck with ya boy)
(Fuck with ya boy)
(With ya boy)
(With ya boy)Embed
