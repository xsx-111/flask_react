You Are Mine Lyrics
Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
That defines the meaning of their lives

You are mine

There are objects of affection
That can mesmerize the soul
There is always one addiction
That just can not be controlled


Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
They hold high their prized possession
