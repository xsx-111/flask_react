Control Lyrics
Take control of the atmosphere
Take me far away from here
There is no better loss than to lose myself in you
In a parachute to glide, I am captive in your sky
Surrender has somehow become so beautiful

Take control of the atmosphere
Take control of the atmosphere
You can take my world, you can fill the air
Take control
Take control

It's such a beautiful surrender
It's such a beautiful surrender

It's such a beautiful surrender
It's such a beautiful surrender

Move me up through the darkest clouds
Till I've lost in the sun every shadow of doubt
There is no better find than to find myself with you
In a fog you are all I see
I'm inviting you closer with each time I breathe
Surrender has somehow become so beautiful


Take control of the atmosphere
Take control of the atmosphere
There's no reason I should breathe unless you're in the air
Take control


And I'm calling out
Would you take control?
And I'm calling outEmbed
