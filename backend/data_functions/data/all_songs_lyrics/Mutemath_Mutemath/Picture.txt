Picture Lyrics
I see our fate, I see our past
And all the things that could not last
It's heavy on this eyes, frozen as I hold this photograph
It's all we're left that's of any worth
And it's so much more than a thousand words
Now, in this frame, is the only way we can endure

I picture you and me always
And in this photograph, we're safe

All I have in my head and all the words I wish I'd said
Sentimental thoughts are overwhelming me again
As I stare through a lens of tears
A thought remains of those fallen years
Now, in the frame, memories are held to persevere


Coping with this loss has broken me
And I'm just hoping things are all as they should be
I picture you and me
