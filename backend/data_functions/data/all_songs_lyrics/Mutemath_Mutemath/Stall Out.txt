Stall Out Lyrics
Racing on a faultline
Bracing for a landslide
Conscious of every move getting harder
Has the race gone underwater?

I keep stalling out, I just can't keep up
There's alarming doubt; am I good enough?
But you keep coming around to convince me
It's still far from over

We are still far
We are still far
We are still far from overEmbed
