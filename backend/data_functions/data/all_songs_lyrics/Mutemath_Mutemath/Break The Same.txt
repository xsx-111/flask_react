Break The Same Lyrics
The crowds roll by and I keep falling in
Everyone's invincible, but it's just pretend
And we all freaked out, what a shame

When only tears know how to remind us we all break the same
We all break the same

Everything we've built could be our demise
It's the sticks and stones that wear us down that often save our lives
And we all freaked out, what a shame


The different stars tonight will somehow fade the same
And all the tears we cry tell us we're made the same
And when we fall aside, let's hope we fall in place
We built our different lives, but they all break the same
Break the same

Different worlds and different hearts
Different souls and different parts
We all, we all break the sameEmbed
