Noticed Lyrics
Careful when you open, it's easy to be broken
In the strangest fashion you start a chain reaction
When you look my way, something's pounding away
And I wonder if I ever felt this before
And all this time oblivious to what you made so obvious
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before

You are reaching something that is beating
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
Over and again, racing out of my skin
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before

You and your ways capture what I've misplaced
In the perfect fashion; just watch my heart's reaction
This point of view is nothing that I'm used to
But I won't close my eyes, because they're onto you
And all this time it was staring me blind
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before

The only time I ever noticed my heart
Is when I noticed you, yeah
The only time I ever noticed my heart
Is when I noticed you, yeah
You are reaching something that is beating
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
Over and again, racing out of my skin
I can't believe I never noticed my heart beforeEmbed
