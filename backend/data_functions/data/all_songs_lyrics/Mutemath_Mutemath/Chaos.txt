Chaos Lyrics
Complications: my claim to fame
And I can't believe there's another
Constantly just another
Can't avoid what I can't control
And I'm losing ground, still I can't stand down
I know, yeah, I know, yeah

I know you stay true when my world is false
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I always see you when my sight is lost
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I know you stay true when my world is false
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I always see you when my sight is lost
Everything around's breaking down to chaos

It's hard to trust anyone again
After all the letdowns I've been through
Haunted by what I've been through
Best to try while I still can breathe
And I'm screaming out, "give me help somehow"
And I know, yeah, I know, yeah
I know you stay true when my world is false
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I always see you when my sight is lost
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I know you stay true when my world is false
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I always see you when my sight is lost
Everything around's breaking down to chaos

I know you stay true when my world is false
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I know you stay true when my world is false
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I always see you when my sight is lost
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I always see you when my sight is lost
Everything around's breaking down to chaos

I know you stay true when my world is false
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I always see you when my sight is lost
Everything around's breaking down to chaosEmbed
