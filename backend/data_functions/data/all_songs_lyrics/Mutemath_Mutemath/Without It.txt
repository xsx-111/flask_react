Without It LyricsHere we are, isn't life bizarre
It likes to take from us and throw it out
We'll carry on, what's done is done
Yeah, we'll do without it somehow
The world's gone don't think about it
'Cause life is short, we'll do without it
They say the road's long, don't think about it
'Cause life is short, we'll do without it
We can move on from here, don't worry
The best we've known is yet to come
We can move on from here, don't worry
The worst won't get the best of us
Some memories are crippling
Don't let the disease bring us down
There's nothing else to know, just let it go
Yeah, we'll do without it somehow
The world's gone don't think about it
'Cause life is short, we'll do without it
They say the road's long, don't think about it
'Cause life is short, we'll do without it
We can move on from here, don't worry
The best we've known is yet to come
We can move on from here, don't worry
The worst won't get the best of us
The world's gone don't think about it
'Cause life is short, we'll do without it
We'll do without it
We'll do without it
We'll do without it
We'll do without it
Yeah
We can move on from here, don't worry
The best we've known is yet to come
We can move on from here, don't worry
The worst won't get the best of us
Though the world is gone, we'll carry on
We'll do without it, we'll do without it
Though the world is gone, we will carry on
We'll do without it, we'll do without itEmbed
