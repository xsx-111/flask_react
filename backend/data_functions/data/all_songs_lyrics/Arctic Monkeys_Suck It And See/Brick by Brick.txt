Brick by Brick Lyrics
I wanna build you up
Brick by brick
I wanna break you down
Brick by brick
Iâ€™m gonna reconstruct
Brick by brick
I wanna feel your love

Brick by brick, aaaaah
Brick by brick, aaaaah

I wanna steal your soul
Brick by brick
I wanna rock and roll
Brick by brick
I wanna rock and roll
Brick by brick
I wanna rock and roll

Brick by brick, aaaaah
Brick by brick, aaaaah
I wanna brick by brick
Brick by brick
I wanna blow by blow
Brick by brick
I want an empty soul
Brick by brick
I wanna brick by brick by brick by...

Brick by brick, aaaaah
Brick by brick, aaaaah6Embed
