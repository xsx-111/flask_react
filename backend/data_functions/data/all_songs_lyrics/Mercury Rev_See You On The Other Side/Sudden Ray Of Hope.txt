Sudden Ray Of Hope LyricsYou bring a sudden ray of hope
Thats comes with every lightning bolt
I love to watch them go up in smoke
You bring a soft summer smile
Come in every once in a while
I wish you'd go the extra mile for me tonight
And everybody knows it
But no one wants to show it
They all just want to throw it in my face
You bring a sudden ray of hope
That comes in very can of coke
I love to feel it roll down my throat
You bring a soft subtle style
That comes around every once in a while
Wish you'd go the extra mile for me tonight
And everybody knows it
But no one wants to show it
They all just want to throw it in my faceEmbed
