Peaceful Night LyricsGood morning sun
Good morning shine
I feel I'm lost
All the time
Somewhere ahead
Must lay my first peaceful night
Crimson flames
Golden shores
Where I land
Don't care no more
Somewhere ahead
Must lay my first peaceful night
Eleventh hour
Heart of stone
On bended knee
Facing home
Somewhere ahead
Must lay my first peaceful night
Almighty above
Almighty below
An unfortunated end
To your Civil War
Somewhere ahead
Must lay my first peaceful nightEmbed
