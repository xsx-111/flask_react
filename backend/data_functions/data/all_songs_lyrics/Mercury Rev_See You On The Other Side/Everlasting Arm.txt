Everlasting Arm Lyrics
And so with the explorers on my heels
I started t'wheel
Set aside stone walls
I was sick of it all
And so I set my sail
On your coattails
And your warm shawl

Up where
There's an Everlasting Arm
Sends us out alone
Moves us out of harm
Ever-reaching always sweeping...


And though I struggled t'take my place
There stood my mistake
Standing there like some
Great big theater curtain
He knew for certain
I'd come down on you softly
Up where
There's an Everlasting Arm
Sends us out alone
Moves us out of harm
Ever-reaching always sweeping...
Up where
Up where
By and by the gates swung wide
Loved ones came in sight
Storming down the street
Like Puerto Rican kids in a summer rain
Breaking open the hydrants
And going insane
And going insane

Up where
There's an Everlasting Arm
Sends us out alone
Moves us out of harm
Ever-reaching always sweeping...
Up where
There's an Everlasting Arm
Sends us out alone
Moves us out of harm
Ever-reaching always sweeping
Up where
Up where
Up where
Up whereEmbed
