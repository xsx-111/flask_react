A Kiss From An Old Flame (A Trip To The Moon) LyricsWith a wink from a starlet's eye
A string of pearls come to life
Who knows what black and crazy thoughts
Swim inside a girlfriend's heart
No brighter jewel is there above
Than the gem of a girl still in love
Below the horizon the last crown jewel
Pales among the stars at noon
When out of the blue a rainbow rockets thru
A kiss from an old flame
A trip to the moon
Endlessly falling my way downtown
Someone to throw both arms around
Who knows what black and crazy names
Swim around inside her brain
Adrift across the silver screen
Just imagine you and me
Our strolling make-believe ballroom glides
Set the rainbow room afire
When out of the blue a rainbow rockets thru
A kiss from an old flame
A trip to the moon
Off into the starlit nite
Two fools rush in you and I
Feel the rough hand close behind
Above the Heaven's Open wide...
When out of the blue a rainbow rockets thru
A kiss from an old flame
A trip to the moon
When out of the blue a rainbow rockets thru
A kiss from an old flame
A trip to the moonEmbed
