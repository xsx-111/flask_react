Empire State (Son House in Excelsis) LyricsHard as the kick in a young man's stride
I stabbed myself back into the night
One heel in front, one heel behind
Life in the Empire State...
Angels and devils before my eyes
The palms of my hands hung by my side
Helpless I watched them destroy and divide
Life in the Empire State...
Cold were my bones, warm was the fire
White was your face cast to my mind
Bright as ever any light that shined
On Life in the Empire State
Into the Void I roared in vain
What if the South's gonna do it again
Promise you'll b by my side for the end
Of Life in the Empire State...
Shrug off the shifting weight of home
And hope that the Almight Anchor will hold
Was there room in your heart for your weakest son all along
Whistle sirens the Blind comin' on...
No matter how lion-hearted my will I still stray beyond?
I threw up my hands and swore I'd find more in your arms
Was the Narrow Way there in our midst all along
Sounds like the empire State's comin' on...Embed
