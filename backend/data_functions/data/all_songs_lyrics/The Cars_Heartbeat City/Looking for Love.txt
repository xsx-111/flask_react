Looking for Love LyricsCome on lover
Make the switch
Pull the cover
Oh make a wish
Find out later
It's all right
Keep the faith
And kill the light
You can't stop
But you can't go on
You can't stop
But it won't be long
Here she comes
(Lookin' for love)
She's lookin' for love
Here she comes
She's lookin' for love
(Here she comes)
Uh she comes
(Lookin' for love)
Oh she comes
(Here she comes)
Ah oo yeah she's lookin' for love
Well come on lover
Oh do it fast
Take advantage
While love lasts
Limited edition
You're the one
A walk on the edge
Oh don't you run
You can't stop
But you can't go on
You can't stop
But it won't be long
Here she comes
(Lookin' for love)
She's lookin' for love
Here she comes
Uh she's lookin' for love
(Here she comes)
Ah she comes
(Lookin' for love)
She's lookin' for love
(Here she comes)
Ah she's lookin' for love
You can't stop
But you can't go on
And you can't stop
But it won't be long
(Here she comes)
Here she comes
(Lookin' for love)
She's lookin' for love
(Here she comes)
Ah lookin' lookin' for love
(Here she comes)
Here she comes comes
(Lookin' for love)
Still lookin'
(Here she comes)
Lookin' for love
Uh she's lookin' for love
(Here she comes)Embed
