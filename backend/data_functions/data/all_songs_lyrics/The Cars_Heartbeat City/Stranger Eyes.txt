Stranger Eyes LyricsA-when you took the fall
And then you floated down
And then you took the jump
And you fell through clouds
Yeah then you watched the world
Beat the crowd
Come on ride me high
(Stranger eyes)
A-well a-ride me high
(Stranger eyes)
Yeah you took the fall
And then you landed soft
You thought to yourself
Ooh well I'm not alone
You with your dark red soul
And your chaperone
Come on ride me high
(Stranger eyes)
Won't you ride me high
(Stranger eyes)
Come on ride me high
(Stranger eyes)
Ride me high
(Danger (?) stranger eyes)
Stranger eyes
Ooh well I need your touch
That means so much
Ooh well I need your touch
'Cause it means so much
A-ride me high
Come on ride me high
(Stranger eyes)
A-yeah ride me high
(Stranger eyes)
Ride me high
(Stranger eyes)
Oh, come on and ride me high
(Danger (?) stranger eyes)
Stranger eyes
(Stranger (echo) stranger eyes)
(Stranger (echo) stranger eyes)
(Stranger (echo) stranger eyes)Embed
