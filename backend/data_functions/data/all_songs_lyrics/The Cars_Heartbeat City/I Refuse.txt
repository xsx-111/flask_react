I Refuse LyricsEverything's heaven sent
That's what you said and went
Inside your fairy glass
Somethin' you think will last
And when they crop you like a clown
You got your smile on upside down
B-baby I refuse
(I do refuse)
Uh, you can pick or choose
(I do refuse)
Find 'omebody else to use
(I do refuse)
'Cause I refuse to come along
And everything's on a whim
That's what you said to him
Lyin' in wunderlust
Are feelings you never trust
And when they pamper you with ice
I can't believe you don't think twice
Uh baby I refuse
(I do refuse)
Uh, you can pick or choose
(I do refuse)
Find somebody else to use
(I do refuse)
'Cause I refuse to come along
And everyone makes the play
With nothing left much to say
They're all in an endless line
Waiting for equal time
They keep screaming it's the truth
And you keep kneelin' in the booth
Oh baby I refuse
(I do refuse)
Uh, you can pick or choose
(I do refuse)
Find somebody else to use
(I do refuse)
'Cause I refuse to come along
Oh, I do refuse
(I do refuse)
Oh, you got nothin' to lose
(I do refuse)
Find somebody else to use
(Find somebody else to use)
(I do refuse)
'Cause I refuse to come along
I refuse
(I do refuse)
Ah, oo-oo
(I do refuse)
(Find somebody else to use)
(I do refuse)
'Cause I refuse to come along
I refuse
(I do refuse)
Ooh, oh got nothin' to lose
(I do refuse)
(Find somebody else to use)
(I do refuse)Embed
