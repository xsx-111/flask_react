Heartbeat City Lyrics
Oh Heartbeat City, here we come
And happy days count on thumbs
And nothin' really gets us down
As long as Jacki's back in town

I'm glad you made it
I can't complain

Oh Jacki, what took you so long?
On just a holiday
Oh Jacki, what took you so long?
I thought you knew the way?
(Heartbeat City)

The noise electric, never stops
And all you need is what you got
And there's a place for everyone
Under Heartbeat City's golden sun

(Jacki)
Oh Jacki
(What took you so long)
What took you so long
On just a holiday
Oh Jacki
(What took you so long)
What took you so long
(So long)
I thought you knew the way
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

You know
I'm glad you made it
I can't complain
I missed you so badly
When you jumped that train

(Jacki)
Oh Jacki
(What took you so long)
What took you so long
On just a holiday
Oh Jacki
(What took you so long)
What took you so long
(So long)
(I thought you knew the way)
I thought you knew the way

(Heartbeat City)
Oh Heartbeat City, lights at night
(Heartbeat City)
It's getting closer, out of sight
(Heartbeat City)
Heartbeat City's on the loose
(Heartbeat City)
Better catch the blue caboose
Oh, huh, Heartbeat City
It's my life
(Heartbeat City)
(Heartbeat City)
(Heartbeat City)Embed
