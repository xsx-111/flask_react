Hello Again Lyrics
Hello, hello again
Hello, hello again

You might have forgot
The journey ends
You tied your knots
You made your friends
You left the scene
Without a trace
One hand on the ground
One hand in space

Oh, you passed on mercy
You tried the rest
You gave your body
You gave the best
Staring at the green door
Living in the sky
You don't want to know it
You just want to fly

Hello (hello), hello again
Hello (hello), hello again
(Hello)
I know (I know you're a dreamer)
Who's under the gun
I know (I know you're a dreamer)
Who's only just begun

Hello, hello again
(I say) Hello, hello again

Oh, and when there's nothing
Nothing left to lose
You leave it all
To fade to blue

(You want to feel) electric
(You want to feel) loose
(You want to be) eclectic
You want to call a truce
(Look) at the profile
Staring at the flame
(Waiting) for the sunshine
Standing in the rain
Hello, hello again
(I said hello) Hello, hello again. (Hello again)
(I said hello) Hello (hello), hello again
Hello (uh oh), hello again

Hello, hello
Hello, helloEmbed
