Alligator Lyrics
Okay

I want someone to come home to
I need somewhere I can sleep
I need a place where I can rest my weary bones
And have a conversation not too deep

Everybody else busy doing better than me
And I can see why it is, they've got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains, someone letting them be

I want someone who can save me
When I come home from the zoo
I need somebody who's a sweet communicator
I can give my alligator to

Everybody seem to know what they are talking about
And I can see why it is, they got someone breaking them out
Someone finding a key, someone setting them free

Could you be that person for me?
Would you feel right setting me free?
Could you dare to find my key?
I want someone who can bail me
When I get up to my tricks
I need somebody used to dealing with a sinner
Whenever I get in a fix

Everybody else busy doing better than me
And I can see why it is, they've got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains, someone letting them be

Could you be that person for me?
Would you feel right setting me free?
Could you dare to find my key?2Embed
