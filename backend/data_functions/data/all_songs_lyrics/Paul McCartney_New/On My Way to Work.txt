On My Way to Work Lyrics
On my way to work, I rode a big green bus
I could see everything from the upper deck
People came and went, smoking cigarettes
I picked the packets up, when the people left

But all the time I thought of you
How far away the future seemed
How could I have so many dreams
And one of them not come true?

On my way to work, I bought a magazine
Inside a pretty girl liked to water-ski
She came from Chichester to study history
She had removed her clothes for the likes of me

But all the time I thought of you
How would you know that I was there?
How could I soul-search everywhere
Without knowing what to do?

On my way to work, as I was clocking in
I could see everything, how it came to be
People come and go, smoking cigarettes
I pick the packets up, when the people leave
But all the time I think of you
How far away the future seems
How could I have so many dreams
And one of them not come true?

On my way to work

But all the time I thought of you
How would you know that I was there?
How could I soul-search everywhere
Without knowing what to do?

On my way to work
On my way to workEmbed
