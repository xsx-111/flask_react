Appreciate Lyrics
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)

Lift up your head and remember what your life is
Don't have to give it all away
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)
When you're left for dead in the middle of a crisis
You must appreciate the day
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)

There's something there, but you're frightened to invite it
Beware of pushing it away
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)
Show that you care, and be certain you don't fight it
You must appreciate the day
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)

She says you don't give back what you take
She got evidence you don't appreciate her love, oh yeah
She says it's all a show and no-go
You drop everything, give back
Reciprocate her love
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)

Lift up your head and remember what your life is
Don't have to give it all away
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)
When you're left for dead in the middle of a crisis
You must appreciate the day
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)

She says you don't give back what you take
She got evidence you don't appreciate her love, oh yeah
She says it's all a show and no-go
You drop everything, give back
Reciprocate her love

(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)

There's something there, but you're frightened to invite it
Beware of pushing it away
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)
Show that you care, and be certain you don't fight it
You must appreciate the day
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)
(Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate
Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate
Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate
Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate)Embed
