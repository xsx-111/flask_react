Save Us Lyrics
I can try to give you everything you ever wanted
You're not hard to please
And the only thing I'm asking in return is something
You can give with ease

Keep on sending your love
In the heat of battle
You've got something that'll save us
Save us now

I've got a feeling there's a jungle rhythm beating in me
When I'm close to you
I don't really want to ask for many favors
But there's something you can do

Keep on sending your love
In the heat of battle
We've got something that'll save us
Save us now

Woah, oh, oh, oh
You're my woman
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Keep it coming
Woah, oh, oh, oh
You've got something that can save us, save us
Keep on sending your love
'Cause in the heat of battle
You've got something that'll save us
Save us now

Save us now
Save us nowEmbed
