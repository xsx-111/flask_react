Everybody Out There Lyrics
Hey, everybody out there
You know what it's like
If you haven't got a life
When you haven't got a life
Hey, do you want to make a difference?
Well, stand in the line
If you haven't got the time
I can give you some of mine

There, but for the grace of God go you and I
We're the brightest objects in the sky
There, but for the grace of God go you and I
Do some good before you say goodbye

Hey, I was trying to remember
How bad it was then
When you didn't have a friend
When you didn't have a friend
Hey, everybody out there (Oh oh oh oh)
Everybody out there
Hey, everybody out there (Oh oh oh oh)
There, but for the grace of God go you and I
We're the brightest objects in the sky
Remember, there but for the grace of God go you and I
Do some good before you say goodbye

Hey, everybody out there
Oh, talk to me
I can't hear you
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey, everybody out there
I know what it's like
I know what it's like
Everybody out there
I can't hear you, I can't hear you
Everybody out thereEmbed
