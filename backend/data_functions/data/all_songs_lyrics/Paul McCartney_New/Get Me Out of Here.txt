Get Me Out of Here Lyrics
I get a feeling when they call my name
Feels like we're all involved in some kind of game
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, get me out of here

Hear the taxman knocking at my door
I've got a feeling he'll be asking for more
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, someone get me out of here
Yeah

When we fight I don't know what to say
If feels so bad and yet I can't run away
Oh boy, oh boy someone get me out of here
I'm a celebrity
Oh boy, someone get me out of here


I see the doctor coming down the street
I got no fever, but I'm feeling the heat
Oh boy, (oh boy)
Get me out of here (someone get me out of here)
Oh boy, (oh boy) someone get me out of here
Oh boy, (oh boy)
Get me out of here (someone get me out of here)
Oh boy, (oh boy) someone get me out of hereEmbed
