Queenie Eye Lyrics
There were rules you never told me, never came up with a plan
All the stories that you sold me didn't help me understand
But I had to get it worked out, had nobody who could help
So then in the end it turned out that I had to do it by myself

Life's a game, rags from riches
Dogs and bitches hunt for fame
Difficult to know which way to turn
Lay the blame on the snitches
Wicked witches fan the flame
Careful what you touch in case you burn

Queenie eye, Queenie eye, who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out (out), that's out (out)
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about (About)
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

Play the game, take your chances
Every dance is much the same
Doesn't matter which of them you choose
Never blame circumstances
If romances seldom came
Never pick a fight you're gonna lose
Queenie eye, Queenie eye, who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out (out), that's out (out)
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about (about)
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

It's a long way to the finish
When you've never been before
I was nervous, but I did it
Now I'm going back for more

That's out
Yeah (Ay), yeah (ay), ay ay ay
Ay (Yeah), ay (yeah), ay, ay, ay (yeah)
Hear the people shout
Yeah (Ay), yeah (ay), ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, yeah, yeah

Queenie eye, Queenie eye, who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out (out), that's out (out)
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about (about)
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout
Queenie eye, Queenie eye, who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out (out), that's out (out)
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about (about)
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout5Embed
