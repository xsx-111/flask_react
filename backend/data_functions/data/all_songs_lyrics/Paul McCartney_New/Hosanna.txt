Hosanna Lyrics
Come now, lady, don't you do me wrong
I fell for you, and now it won't be long
Before I hold you in my arms
Before I take you to my heart again

Time is flying by us every day
I want to show my love in every way
I want to hold you in my arms
I want to take you to my heart again

If you believe it, you can stay all night
Hide in the darkness 'til it's getting light
Do everything until we've got it done
Then sing hosanna to the morning sun
Hosanna, hosanna
Sing hosanna to the morning sun

Calm down, lady, don't put up a fight
If you are true, you know the time is right
For me to hold you in my arms
For me to take you to my heart
If you believe it we can stay all night
Hide in the darkness till it's getting light
Do everything until we've got it done
Then sing hosanna to the morning sun
Hosanna, hosanna
Sing hosanna to the morning sun
Hosanna, hosannaEmbed
