On The Road Lyrics
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Hit up the bottolo
Scored us the finest herb
Jumped aboard that rolling stone
Took to the sky like a bird
Now the wheels are in full spin
We're off to play a thousand shows
Took a drag, fell in a dream
Took to the sky like a crow

She don't like it when I'm on the road
She don't like it when I'm on the road
She don't like it when I'm on the road
She don't like it when I'm on the road

Turn up the radio
Play 'A Horse With No Name'
Ten miles to the show
We're running late in a running late game
That road can burn through your heart
Make you forget what you're doing it for
But I'll keep walking through the dark
I'll keep knocking at that door, yes, I will

She don't like it when I'm on the road
She don't like it when I'm on the road
She don't like it when I'm on the road
She don't like it when I'm on the roadEmbed
