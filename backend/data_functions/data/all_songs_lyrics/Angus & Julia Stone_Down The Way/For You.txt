For You Lyrics
If I talk real slowly
If I try real hard
To make my point dear
That you have my heart
Here I go

I'll tell you
What you already know
Here I go
I'll tell you
What you already know

If you love me
With all of your heart
If you love me
I'll make you a star in my universe
You'll never have to go to work
You'll spend everyday
Shining your light my way

If I talk real slowly
If I hold your hand
If you look real closely my love
You might understand
Here I go
I'll tell you
What you already know
Here I go
I'll tell you
What you already know

If you love me
With all that you are
If you love me
I'll make you a star in my universe
You'll never have to go to work
You'll spend everyday
Shining your light my way
Here I go

I'll tell you
What you already know
Here I go
I'll tell you
What you already know

If you love me
With all of your heart
If you love me
I'll make you a star in my universe
You'll never have to go to work
You'll spend everyday
Shining your light my way6Embed
