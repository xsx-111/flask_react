Draw Your Swords Lyrics
See her come down, through the clouds
I feel like a fool
I ain't got nothing left to give
Nothing to lose

So come on, love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Let's not fuck around

'Cause you are, the only one
'Cause you are, the only one

I see them snakes come through the ground
They choke me to the bone
They tie me to that wooden chair
Here on my throne

So come on, love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Let's not fuck around
'Cause you are, the only one
'Cause you are, the only one
The only one
'Cause you are, the only one
The only one
'Cause you are, the only one

The only one
The only one
The only one
The only one

So come on, love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Let's not fuck around

The only one
The only one
The only one13Embed
