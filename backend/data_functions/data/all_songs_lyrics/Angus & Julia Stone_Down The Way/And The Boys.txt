And The Boys Lyrics
It's been days now
And you've changed your mind again
It feels like years
And I can tell how time can bend your ideas

And the boys go on and on and on and on
And the boys go on and on and on and on

And there's gold
Falling from the ceiling of this world
Falling from the heartbeat of this girl
Falling from the things we should have learned
Falling from the things we could have heard

Well, it's been days now
And you've changed your mind again
All the cracks in the walls
Reminds you of things we said
And I could tell you
That I won't hurt you this time
But it's just safer
To keep you in this heart of mine
And the boys go on and on and on and on
And the boys go on and on and on and on

And there's gold
Falling from the ceiling of this world
Falling from the heartbeat of this girl
Falling from the things we could have learned
Falling from the things we could have heard

And the boys, and the boys
And the boys, and the boys
And the boys, and the boys go on and on

And the boys go on and on and on and on
And the boys go on and on and on and on

And there's gold
Falling from the ceiling of this world
Falling from the heartbeat of this girl
Falling from the things we should have learned
Falling from the things we could have heard
Falling from the people that we heard
Falling from the love we never earned
Falling from the sky that should have burned
Falling from my heart
Falling from my heart
Falling from my heart
Falling from my heart
And the boys go on and on and on and on1Embed
