Hush Lyrics
If you wake to find you're all alone
Call me up on the telephone and I'll say
"Come on 'round, kick up your feet
I'll check to see if your heart still beats, you can stay"
I heard her laugh but she sounded blue
I said: "You know my heart's for you, it lies awake"
"Dreaming of its promised land
A gentle touch from your gentle hand", I would say

So hush, little darling, don't you cry
Hush, little darling, gonna make you mine

I know our love did rust away
But through that window came a better day
So don't close the blinds
'Cause you're my light, you're my emptiness
The pretty colors on that summer dress, babe
You're all the things that fall from the sky
The sun, the rain, the moon, the light, babe
So come on down to this earthly being
And I'll hold you close when you're in need, babe
So hush, little darling, don't you cry
Hush, little darling, gonna make you mine
Hush, little darling, don't you cry
So hush, little darling, gonna make you mineEmbed
