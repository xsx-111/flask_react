Walk It Off Lyrics
Walk it off now
You can tell them all how, how hard we tried to work it out
Walk it off, dear
Standing here with your tail between your thighs

Here we stand
There's nothing left for you, there's nothing left for me
Here I am
There's nothing left for you, there's nothing left for me

I will never be what you want to see now
I will never be what you want to see now
I never wanted you to go
But I'd be the last to let you know

Walk it off now
You can tell them all how, how good it feels to be let down
Tell them all about
How long it was to get around to her side of town

Here we stand
There's nothing left for you, there's nothing left for me
Here I am
There's nothing left for you, there's nothing left for me
I will never be what you want to see now
I will never be what you want to see now
I never wanted you to go
But I'd be the last to let you know

Walk it off now
You can tell them all how I finally let you down
Stand around here in this small town
And tell me how it feels, tell me how it feelsEmbed
