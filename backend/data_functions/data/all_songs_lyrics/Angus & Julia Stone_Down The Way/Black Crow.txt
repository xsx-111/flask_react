Black Crow Lyrics
Eyes from the free
Take me down the way
Red riders of the dark
Help me through this maze

Do you know, mister, of this place?
Do you know, mister? No time to waste

Won't you help me be on my way?
Won't you help me be on my way?
So I can set me free

Saw murder in her eyes
The dark of a thousand crows
Cold thriller in disguise
Blue shadows stitched to her toes

Do you know, mister, of this place?
Do you know, mister? No time to waste

Won't you help me be on my way?
Won't you help me be on my way?
So I can set me free
There's propergand for every man
On the paper stand, you know
When will the spinsters face
Let give that twist of grace you know?

Do you know, mister, of this place?
Do you know, mister? No time to waste

Won't you help me be on my way?
Won't you help me be on my way?
So I can set me free1Embed
