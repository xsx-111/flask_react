Drifting LyricsWhat a wonderful hesitation
Who would bear to feel sorry for me
Dropped another pill just to calm me
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
There I was drifting
Way out into the sunshine
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive
Find myself awake counting sad days
1-2-3 that's too many for me
Dropped another pill just to find me
Reached for my hand but it was already there
Then I started believin'
That I fell out of a tiny raindrop
That lost it's way when I decided to roam
Chasing me was a hungry dweller
But I had escaped it by pretending to die
Come follow me you won't expect the illusion
You'll see it's my imagination
Hand me your eyes
I will put them in front of mine
You'll see a little better
You'll see a little better
What a wonderful destination
Where I am now
I can no longer see
Dropped another pill just to kill me
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
There I was drifting
Way out into the sunshine
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive
But I had escaped it by pretending to die1Embed
