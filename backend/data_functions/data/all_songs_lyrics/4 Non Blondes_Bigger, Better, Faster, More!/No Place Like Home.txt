No Place Like Home LyricsWhen I wake up in my house
I get dressed then I get lost
I don't know which way to go
Where the hell was I anyways
I guess I'll have a cup of Joe
So I end up on the street
Walkin' talkin' to my own beat
In a fog, in a haze
1-2-3
I've been trippin' out for days
Can you help me find my way home
Don't rock teh boat now, just let it slide
Groovy people walking back and forth, that's right
So I hop on to this bus
Destination reads please save us
Not a soul that I know
To be found in this dark hole
Can you help me find my way home
I'm so tired of looking for the door
Can you help me find my way home
Please help me find my way
I can't find the door
Please help me find my way
Where am I now, where am I now
I find myself just out there floatingEmbed
