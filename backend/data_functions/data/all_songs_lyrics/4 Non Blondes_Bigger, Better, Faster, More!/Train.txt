Train LyricsWhatcha gonna do child
When your thoughts are movin' slow?
Find another to show you where to go
(And I'm searching for the train)
Oooh child, (and you're searching) for the train
Whatcha gonna do child
When your mommy goes away?
She won't take you
She'll leave you astray
And you're searchin' for the train
And you see it's a train
And you see yourself
Searchin' for somebody else
And you know
He's a train
Whatcha gonna do child
When you leave it all behind?
Find another, to blow it in your mind
You'll be searchin' for the train
And you see it's a train
And you see yourself searchin' for somebody else
And you know that for sure it's your train
Oooh child2Embed
