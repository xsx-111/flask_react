Pleasantly Blue LyricsEvery time you wake in the morning
And you start to cry
And I figure there's something up baby
But you don't tell me why
And I know that's why I call you blue
'cause I figure something baby
That's why I call you pleasantly blue
Hush hush you walk on by
You don't say a word
Talk to me baby, talk to me baby
What haven't I heard
And I know that's why I call you blue
'cause I figure something baby
That's why I call you pleasantly blue
Oh no, here we go
What's wrong with you
Come here baby, come to me baby
What can I do
Yea I know that's why I call you blue
'cause I figure something baby
That's why I call you pleasantly blue
'cause I figure something baby
That's why I call you pleasantly blue1Embed
