Old Mr. Heffer LyricsStumbled my way on the darkest afternoon
I got a beer in my hand and I'm draggin' a stoagle too
The back of my brain is tickin' like a clock
I simmer down gently but boil on what the f
Get back 'cause I'm feelin' good tonight
Trouble is a word that stars with a capital T
Get back 'cause I'm feelin' right
I refer myself to the word 'cause I'm so keen
Little do they know that I'm struttin' such a style
It makes the trouble in me all worth the while
So get back 'cause I'm feelin' good tonight
Get back 'cause I'm feelin' right
There goes Billy and Susie walkin' hand by hand
I quickly caught up slurring yo what's the plan
They had fear in their eyes and bellies that ran like dogs
I barrelled down laughing screaming Susie
You forgot your clogs
Well, Old Mr. Heffer
I'm really pleased to meet you
And Susie wouldn't look at me
But Billy wouldn't talk to me
I didn't mean to scare your blue-eyed child
It made me so doggone crazy
I had to chase them for a mile
All wanted was change for a buck
Yea I'm back and I'm feelin' right
Jesus!
Well I'm back and I'm feelin' good tonight
So get back 'cause I'm feelin' right
