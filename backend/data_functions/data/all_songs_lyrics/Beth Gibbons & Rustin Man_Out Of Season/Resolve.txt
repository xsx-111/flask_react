Resolve LyricsTime rolls
As days go by
And now I've figured
That I ain't gonna last
Summer skies
Are leaving me behind
So resolve your loving said all
I'll be lost when you're gone
Blind me from keep
Blind me
Times told
As days go by
I still ponder this old question why
But now I know
There's no time to decide
So resolve your loving said all
I'll be lost when you're gone
Blind me from keep
Blind me
And daylight knows
How my eyes have tired
Like the circles
Life evermore will bear
So resolve your loving said all
I'll be lost when you're gone
Blind me from keep
Blind meEmbed
