Romance LyricsYou know what they say about romance
You know what they say about romance
Ever changing love that you can't
Keep on side a parking keel
Better the thought than the feeling
It's plain to see
All the things we suffer
From the the hands of humanity
But that ain't me
That ain't me
But that ain't me
That ain't me
And I know there's a god inside it
Should I love your key
Adorn you
And get inside
But that ain't me
That ain't me
But that ain't me
That ain't me
And I know I may come to doubt it
But if I ever wish
I wish we could all believe
That in this daylight world
Is a world
Where love can be
And I won't ever forget it
Cuz that ain't me
That ain't me
Cuz that ain't me
Well that ain't meEmbed
