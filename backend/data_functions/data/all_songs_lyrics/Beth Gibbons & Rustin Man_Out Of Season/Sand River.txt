Sand River LyricsAutumn leaves
Beauty's got a hold on me
Autumn leaves
Pretty as can be
Everybody knows this time
Shadows are drifting in silence
Where lost can't be found
Everybody knows this time
You'll get by
Move it on and let fate decide
And those water-coloured memories
Soft as a summer's breeze
You're as pretty as can be
Knowing now you'll never fake it
Whether my oceans divide
I'll try to understand this
But everybody knows this time
Autumn leaves
Beauty's got a hold on me
Autumn leaves
Pretty as can be
Everyone can see
Everyone except me
Autumn leaves
Beauty's got a hold on me
Autumn leaves
Pretty as can be
Pretty as can beEmbed
