Drake LyricsTurning now she caught his eye
For all he knows he cannot see
Pleasures smoulder inside
Cover seasons that fell from view
Long ago
Blame on your heart
But then you know that now
What do you do
You hide lies inside
Why do you do that
I don't know why
How long did i know you
For i don't know why you had to go
If only you had told her
The words to enfold her
Long ago
She took a breath and she never spoke
The words that tasted like to know she told a matinee
There was an odour/Unannounced anyway
But you can take and you can see
There's never enough of love for destiny
Don't look back from day to day
What i noticed wasn't me
Strangers they'll part again
They'll never know
For all the years they've disguised inside
Knowing their years of loss remain
How long did i know you
For i don't know why you had to go
If only you had told her
The words to enfold her
