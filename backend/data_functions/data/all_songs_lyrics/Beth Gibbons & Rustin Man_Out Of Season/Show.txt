Show LyricsLet the show begin
It's a sorry sight
Let it all deceive
Now I'm
Pains in me that I've never found
Let the show begin
Let the clouds roll
There's a life to be found in this world
And now I see it's all but a game
That we hope to achieve
What we can
What we will
What we did suddenly
But it's all just a show
A time for us and the words we'll never know
And daylight comes and fades with the tide
And I'm here to stay
But it's all just a show
A time for us and the words we'll never know
And daylight comes and fades with the tide
I'm here to stayEmbed
