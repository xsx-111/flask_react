Rustin Man LyricsOh Rustin Man
I can't deny this is you again
Little I know but how the hold is holding you
Let's all decide the shame
Many more were left to stay
Many decided love was a game
How many more days can we take in the hope of seeing you
Oh Rustin Man
I can't deny this is you again
Little little little I know but how the hold is holding you
Lets all get out of frame
Oh Rustin Man
I can't deny this is you againEmbed
