Reaper Lyrics
I close your eyes and send you into vainly dreams
I reign your soul. the night engulf your painful screams
I watch you cry and twist your soul in agony
No prayers can save you now from hell in eternity

I devastate your soul and lacerate your mind
In sin I sanctify my sword to crush your spine
I'm the reaper

You're too confused, you can't elude my misty eyes
No need to hang on to your faith in love and life
Whatever I command, your soul obeys my needs
You're like a zombie now with a soul that burns and bleeds

There's not much left of you, your soul belongs to me
Nothing can save you now or set your spirit free
I'm the reaper

Coming to take you

I love the sight of having you down and open wide
The smell of a dead woman's flesh just drives me fucking wild
I have got you in my grasp now, there is no need to escape
I'll penetrate you, every virgin needs a rape
Just when you think you have gone through all that gives you pain
I'm coming back to you to penetrate again
I'm the reaper1Embed
