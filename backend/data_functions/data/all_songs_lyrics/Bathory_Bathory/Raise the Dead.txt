Raise the Dead Lyrics
Dust to dust

I gasp for air, I scream for sight
And fight against torment and dread
Calling the vengeance, I tear at the lid
And promise to raise from the dead

Raise the dead
Raise the dead
Raise the dead

Black witch of beauty, all Hell's necromancers
Give me the powers of Hell
Mistress of curse, reapers and vultures
Demons stand up and chime the bell

Raise the dead
Raise the dead
Raise the dead

Hear the infernal legions plea
We shall rise
Suddenly powers comes from within
Muscles and mind are filled with wrath
I burst out in frenzy, powers of Hell
And break up the tomb and the dark

Raise the dead
Raise the dead
Raise the deadEmbed
