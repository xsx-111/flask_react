War Lyrics
The bells of war doth chime tonight
And the heavens shake with fear
The earth commotion, the sky is in flames
The battle is ever near
Troops of Hell, tonight they storm
The walls they so despise
Heaven's gates are closing in
The night is filled with cries

War
War
War

A crack of thunder, a smell of death
The winds of mayhem blows
Heaven in its final breath
And God lose all control
Prayers for mercy, cries for help
Won't stop the blasphemy
Our troops emerge the sacred throne
And the victory is complete

War
War
War

War
