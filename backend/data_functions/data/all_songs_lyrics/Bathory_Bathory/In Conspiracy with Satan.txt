In Conspiracy with Satan Lyrics
The lies of Christ will lose
The ways of hell I choose
I drink the floating blood
Defy the fury of God
I have turned my back on Christ
To hell I have sacrificed
I have made love to the Pagan Queen
The gates of hell I have seen

I heard the angels cry
I watched the witches fly
I saw the clouds of death
Slowly blackening the sky
I read the book of spell
I chimed death's ancient bell
And when I die I have a place
Reserved in hell
In conspiracy with Satan

I ride the bloodstained goat
I let the brewage float
I have seen the reaper's face
And walked through eternal haze
I have kissed my master's hand
I have seen the children of the damned
I heard the demons call
And seen a thousand virgins fall
I heard the angels cry
I watched the witches fly
I saw the clouds of death
Slowly blackening the sky
I read the book of spell
I chimed death's ancient bell
And when I die I have a place
Reserved in hell
