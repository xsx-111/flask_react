Armageddon Lyrics
I swear the oath of blood and tear the virgin's flesh
I gash the wounds of Heaven and rides the wings of death
Tonight the cauldrons are filled with brewage made of hate
Tonight we blasphemy, possessed, we desecrate

Tonight we raise our cups and toast in an angel's blood
Salute Hell's victory, despise the words of God
Armageddon

Eternal battlefields, no prisoners we take
We rape your sacred souls behind the seven gates
Tonight you all will hear the angels cry of pain
And in the sky you will see the all eternal flame

On earth you mortal fools obey the Christian ways
But there is no mighty god to hear your final prayers
Armageddon

Forks of lightning strikes in the sky the sound of thunder rolls
Satan chimes the bell of death and beckons all your souls
Heaven's angels realizes there is no place they can hide
Tonight the furnace gates of Hell stands open wide
Black witch of beauty hovers around and cast her spells
Tonight a virgin's womb shall breed a son of Hell
Armageddon
