This Lullaby LyricsWhere, oh, where have you been my love?
Where, oh, where can you be?
It's been so long since the moon has gone
And, oh, what a wreck you've made me
Are you there over the ocean?
Are you there up in the sky?
Until the return of my love, this lullaby
My hope is on the horizon
Every face, your eyes I can see
I plead and pray though each night and day
Our embrace is only a dream
And as sure as days come from moments
Each hour becomes a life's time
When she'd left, I'd only begun this lullaby5Embed
