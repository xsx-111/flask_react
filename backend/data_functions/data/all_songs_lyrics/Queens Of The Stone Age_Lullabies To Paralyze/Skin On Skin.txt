Skin On Skin Lyrics
From the moment you said “why haven’t you kissed me yet?”
I knew I’d wipe that paint from your lips
I stare the lids off your eyes
Gone down on your dirty mind
And end up between your hips
Handfuls of sweat tangled hair, anytime, anywhere
I wanna lick you too much, baby
I just play all alone, whispering for your moan
Forced to crawl down this line, just to touch
I can get in, I can’t get out
I can get in, I can’t get out

I’m just sweating my sheets
I hate to see you leave
But I love to watch you go, baby
Twisted secret lives
The way you bat your eyes
Giving head, giving head, giving head

Watch you come from above
I’m so needy for love
I’m desperate, greedy in slavery
Sneak around from behind
I got a one-track mind
We got a skin on skin thing, baby
I wanna lick you too much
I wanna lick you too much
I hear you comin', ooh ahh, baby
I wanna lick you too much
I wanna lick you too much
I hear you comin', ooh ahh, baby1Embed
