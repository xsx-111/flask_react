Everybody Knows That You Are Insane Lyrics
You wanna know why you feel so hollow?
'Cause you are
You're missing out, well, if you say so
Then you're missing out

Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane

You wanna know just how long you can hide from
What you are, not very long
I have been lost, down every road I follow
Out in the dark and on my way home

Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane


And I feel nothing, am I better yet?
And I feel nothing, am I better yet?
And I feel nothing, am I better yet?
And I feel nothing, am I better yet?
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane4Embed
