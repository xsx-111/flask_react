I Never Came Lyrics
When you say it's dead and gone
Yes I know, you're wrong
Cut and slash, sharpest knife
It won't die, yeah
Poison cup, drank it up
It won't die
No fire, no gun, no rope, no stone
It won't die, yeah

Why you gotta shove it in my face?
As if you put me in my place
'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right
Not goin' to spend another night
In your bed, in your bed

Laws of men are just pretend
They ain't mine
Love, so good, love so bad
It won't die
Some talk too long, they know it all
Well, I just smile and move on
Words ain't free like you and me
I don't mind, yeah
Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel?
The dogs are loose, I'm on to you
You ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk
Can't call it leaving 'cause it's just
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never cameEmbed
