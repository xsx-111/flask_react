Long Slow Goodbye Lyrics
Where have you gone again my sweet?
Everybody wants to know
Where have you gone again my sweet?
Everybody wants to know
Where you gone?
Where you gone?

I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street
Waiting, when you coming home?
I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street
Waiting, when you coming home?
Gone so long
Where you gone?

On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye

In every voice, I hear you speak
Waiting by the telephone
I close my eyes, I just can't sleep
Roll and tumble all night long
All night long
Where you gone? yeah
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye

I close my eyes, I just can't sleep
Where have you gone again my sweet?

On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
