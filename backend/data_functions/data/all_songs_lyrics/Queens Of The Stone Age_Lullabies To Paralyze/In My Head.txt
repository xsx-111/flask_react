In My Head Lyrics
It's the cruelest joke to play
I'm so high, I run in place
Only a line we separate, so

I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

You're the only thing I've got
I can't seem to get enough
We collide for one embrace, so

I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it
Oh, oh
Hurry up, and wait forever

I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head (It's all I've got)
And you're in my head, so I need it (In my head)


I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

I need it
I need it
I need it
