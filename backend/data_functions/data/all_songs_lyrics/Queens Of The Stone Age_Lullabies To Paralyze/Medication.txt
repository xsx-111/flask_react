Medication Lyrics
Medication for us all, it is a new way
And we're gonna take it 'cause we love it
Don't you know?
Is this the dose you've been dreaming of?
A revelation from a gun
Doesn't matter
Overtaken, mine was yours, now overthrown

No

Just copulation in a song
I'm so contagious, can I come?
In the new way
All of us cast asides became what has become

No

Medication for us all
You think you know me, well you're wrong
Doesn't matter
All of us cast aside became what has becomeEmbed
