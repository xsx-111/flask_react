Like a Drug (Bonus Track) Lyrics
Since you're gone, I sat at home
Wonder why no I'll never be free
But the thought of you
Going with another guy
No, it could never be me
You took a ring and pawned our love away
What can I say, I am left behind
So I take a drink, another cigarette
I can't forget that you once were mine

What can I say?
I guess it wasn't meant to be, no
But now you're gone
It's us, your love is like a drug

It's been so long
Your folks have bet you're gone
But I know that you're alive inside
So I hope and pray you won't throw this love away
I just wish that you still were mine

What can I say?
I guess it wasn't meant to be
But now you're gone
It's just, your love is like a drugEmbed
