Tangled Up in Plaid Lyrics
I slipped
Didn't mean, didn't mean to do it that way
But I blew in on a whim, gone tomorrow?
(Shit) I'm gone today

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, woah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Come, let's play along
And let each other lose
A win would cause an alarm
Don't matter to me, don't matter to you

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh yeah

I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, woah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Self-inflicted wound
Your gift, impeccable aim
Can really clear a room
All the bodies piled up in your wake

Oh yeah
(It hurts) So bad
(It must) Oh yeah

I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So kill yourself
