Broken Box Lyrics
And you know this...
(It's all mine, alright)

I've got wine and so do you
Mine came with the cork
I wish yours did too

Everyone just loves you so
Well hurray! (Yay)
Now you know where to go (Easy)

In my head, you're all brand new
I guess you're really all the same
In my head, you're all brand new
And tell your new boy where I came
In my head, you're all brand new
I just didn't want what you gave
In my head, you're all brand new
Go and find yourself another slave

There you are
There you are
There you are
Ooh, you're so in love, just like Juliet
Well guess what?
That's one thing that you can for-fucking-get
Tears from the sky in pools of pain
Well, baby tonight
I'm gonna go and dance in the rain
(Make up my own damn rules)

In my head, you're all brand new
I guess you're really all the same
In my head, you're all brand new
Tell your new boy where I came
In my head, you're all brand new
Take that broken pussy elsewhere
In my head, you're all brand new
Save it, baby, I don't care2Embed
