Touch From Your Lust LyricsI need to sleep but I'm too tired
I need to calm down but I'm too wired
When the sun comes up I miss the moon
Cause I know tomorrow is gonna come too soon
She only wants to be wanted
But time crumbles blue roses to dust
Now I long to feel the touch from your lust
Scars on your back tell where you've been
But I'll roll like the ocean if you'll blow like the wind
Sweet Texas angel what have your blue eyes seen
I'll be your country gentleman
If you will be my Mason Dixon Queen
Queen
She only wants to be wanted
But time crumbles blue roses to dust
Now I long to feel the touch from your lust
So much sweeter than all the rest
You're what lies between pain and death
Sinners and saints call you by name
If you're gonna take the praise
You're gonna have to learn to take the blame
She only wants to be wanted
But time crumbles blue roses to dust
Now I long to feel the touch from yourEmbed
