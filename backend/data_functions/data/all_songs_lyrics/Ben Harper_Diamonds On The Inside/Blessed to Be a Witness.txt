Blessed to Be a Witness LyricsCorcovado parted the sky
And through the darkness
On us He shined
Crucified in stone
Still his blood is my own
Glory behold all my eyes have seen
I am blessed to be a witness
Some have flown away
And can't be with us here today
Like the hills of my home
Some have crumbled and are now gone
Gather around for today won't come again
I am blessed to be a witness
So much sorrow and pain
Still I will not live in vain
Like good questions never asked
Is wisdom wasted on the past
Only by the grace of God go I
I am blessed to be a witnessEmbed
