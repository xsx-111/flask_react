Temporary Remedy LyricsI killed a snake with a bible
I was living a johnny cash song
I'm afraid for this i may be liable
So its best i be moving - moving along
Just a temporary remedy
Running through my
Running through my veins
Summer lasted through november
Funny when its gone you miss cold
Words can be spoken for a lifetime
We can never hear until we're told
Just a temporary remedy
Running through my
Running through my veins
They tell me nothing is perfect
Then tell me why is it a word
Yesterday's news is tomorrow's blues
Now they're perfectly blurred
Just a temporary remedy
Running through
Running through my veins
Just a temporary remedy
Running through
Running through my veinsEmbed
