Brown Eyed Blues LyricsIf I knew
Being here with you today
Would mean being alone tomorrow
I would gladly trade
All of my tomorrows away
For a moment with you
Brown Eyed Blues
You can find yourself another fool
I said hey, hey, heeeey
Can you look
Into my eyes
Or has your heart gone blind?
Said has your heart gone blind?
What can you look
Can you look
Into your own
And find the safe place to hide?
Brown Eyed Blue
You can find yourself another fool
I said hey, hey, heeeey
Why be with a stranger
When you could be
With your friend?
If you're ever lonely
You know I'm lonely too
And I'll stay lonely
Until, I'm again with you
Brown Eyed Blues
You can find yourself another foolEmbed
