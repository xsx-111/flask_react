Everything LyricsBehind all your tears
There's a smile
Behind all of the rain
There's a sunshine for miles and miles
Everything
Everything
You mean everything
You mean everything
Everything to me
The colors of your garden
They're yellow, blue, and green
And the sound of your sweet voice
It's better than all my dreams
Everything
Everything
You mean everything
You mean everything
Everything to me
You're my first thought in the morning
When I rise
You're my last thought in the evening
When I rest my head at night
Everything
Everything
You mean everything
You mean everything
Everything to meEmbed
