Picture of Jesus LyricsIt hangs above my altar
Like they hung Him from a cross
I keep one in my wallet
For the times I feel lost
In a wooden frame with splinters
Where my family kneels to pray
And if you listen close
You'll hear the words He used to say
I've got a picture of Jesus
In His arms so many prayers rest
We've got a picture of Jesus
And with Him we shall be forever blessed
Now it has been spoken
He would come again
But would we recognize
This king among men
There was a man in our time
His words shine bright like the sun
He tried to lift the masses
And was crucified by gun
He was a picture of Jesus
With Him so many prayers rest
He is a picture of Jesus
In His arms so many prayers rest
With Him we shall be forever blessed
Somedays have no beginning
Some days have no end
Some roads are straight and narrow
And some roads only bend
So let us say a prayer
For every living thing
Walking towards a light
From the cross of a King
We long to be a picture of Jesus
In His arms so many prayers rest
I long to be a picture of Jesus
With Him we shall be forever blessedEmbed
