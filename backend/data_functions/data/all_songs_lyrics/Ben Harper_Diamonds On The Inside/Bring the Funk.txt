Bring the Funk LyricsWhen it's on the one
You know the funk's begun
When you are down and out
There is no doubt
You need the funk
Just bring the funk
Bring the funk
Bring the funk
Now what's the problem
Everybody's got them
Just get the hole
Out of your soul
And bring the funk
Bring me the funk
Bring the funk
If you got a glass closet
Don't you throw no bones
There's only getting
Until the getting's gone
So pass me the funk
(pass the funk)
Got to have my funk
(got to have my funk)
Oh- I need my funk
(need my funk)
Got to have my funk
(got to have my funk)
Some are jiving
Some are shuck
Some are just
Down on their luck
They just need the funk
(need the funk)
They got to have the funk
(got to have the funk)
Just bring 'em some funk
(bring the funk)
Just bring the funk
(just bring the funk)
Well, well
Bring it (repeat...)
Well stay black
(stay black)
Stay white
Stay brown get on down
Just bring the funk
Got to bring the funk
Bring the funk
Need it - I need it (repeat...)
Yeah
Well it's got to be solid
That's what you call it
Funk me up
Funk me down
Funk me sideways
Funk me all ways
Bring the funk
Got to bring the funk
Bring the funk
Oh- some things money can't fix
(like what?)
Some things only money will do the trick
It's not the end of the world
But I can see it from here
So bring - bring - bring - bring
Bring me the funk
(bring the funk)
Just bring the funk
(just bring me the funk)
Oh- bring the funk
(bring the funk)
(just bring me the funk)Embed
