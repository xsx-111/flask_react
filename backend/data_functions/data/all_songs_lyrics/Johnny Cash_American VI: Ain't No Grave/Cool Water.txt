Cool Water Lyrics
All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water, cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burnt dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool, clear, water

Keep moving, Dan, don't you listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can you see that big, green tree
Where the water's running free
And it's waiting there for me and you
It's water, cool, clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear, water
