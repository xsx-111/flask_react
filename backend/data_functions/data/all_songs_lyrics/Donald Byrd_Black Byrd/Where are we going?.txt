Where are we going? LyricsDay in, day out
Sidewalk sleepers turn about
Day by day, the work gets done
And day by day another war goes on
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
With all that's goin' on where are we gettin'?
Day in and day out
A little boy and girl are goin' out
And day by day baby's babies are born
And day by day people say:"Right on"
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
With all that's goin' on where are we gettin'?
Day in and day out
It gets better, the people shout
And day by day the flames get higher
Lies and hate, they fuel the fire
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
With all that's goin' on where are we gettin'?
Where are we going?
And what's the future showin'?
Where are we headin'?
With all that's goin' on where are we gettin'?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
With all that's goin' on where are we gettin'?Embed
