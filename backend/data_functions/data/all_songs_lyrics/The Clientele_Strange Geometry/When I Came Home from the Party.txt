When I Came Home from the Party Lyrics
When I came home from the party
Everything had changed
The city was beside itself
Just one inch away

Alright, my tongue gets split, my hands are gloves
I just can't quite shake it off
I just can't quite shake it off
I just can't quite shake it off

When I came home from the movies
Through each tenement line
The city was in rapture for
The twenty-second time

Alright, they haunted you in middle school
All the sunlit faces
Marching through the crowd
All the sunlit faces marching through the crowd

All that day and all that night our dead friends walked into the streets
Their faces in the doorways like a mirror to your photographs
They mingled with the crowds until the living and the dead became each otherEmbed
