Step into the Light Lyrics
To make a tempest of our dreams
Your white skin on my lips, it seems
That I must thread our fingers through
This night without an end

So let your eyes uncover mine
The fading heat, the broken lines
The summer in the shadows
Of your body next to mine

And goodnight, my darling, goodnight
My heart's empty
The scenes that I'm playing go crazy before me
When I close my eyes
But won't you step into the light?
Won't you move out of the shadows?
Won't you step into the light?
I'm losing my mind

And I burned down right to my skin
To needled fingertips
The empty day, a breviary
That shivers into this, that shivers into this
A starry summer evening came
Our murmured love has closed the frame
On everybody walking outside
Underneath the stars

So let your eyes uncover mine
The fading heat, the broken lines
The summer in the shadows
Of your body next to mine

And goodnight, my darling, goodnight
My heart's empty
The scenes that I'm playing go crazy before me
When I close my eyes
But won't you step into the light?
Won't you move out of the shadows?
Won't you step into the light?
I'm losing my mindEmbed
