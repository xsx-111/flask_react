Geometry of Lawns Lyrics
Leaving came to us
Just like a song
A dull geometry of lawns
The sense that you are still a stranger

But we were born
To fade away like light
Looking sideways into life
There is no reason we should stay here

And I know you are listening to this song
Late in a still room with your lover
Now see that moon above the edge of speech
As we flicker like a screen and we are gone

Once a spell of grace
Came over me
And I walked on through empty streets
Redbricks, sweat shops, and madrassahs

Inside everything
I heard a voice
Mechanical, beyond itself
Like the sentence of a dreamer
And I know you are listening to this song
Late in a still room with your lover
Now see that moon above the edge of speech
Out here beyond your reach I'm singing onEmbed
