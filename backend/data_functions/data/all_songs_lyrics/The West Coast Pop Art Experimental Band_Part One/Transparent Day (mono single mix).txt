Transparent Day (mono single mix) LyricsTell me what to do
Tell me how high to go
I don't know whether to believe in you
So don't be surprised when I leave you
What a transparent day
Oh, what a transparent day
I have so much to tell you
So many real things to say
You want me for your collection
But you can't see through your own reflection
What a transparent day
Oh, what a transparent day
Tell me what to do
Tell me how high to go
I don't know whether to believe in you
So don't be surprised when I leave you
What a transparent day
Oh, what a transparent day
What a transparent day
Oh, what a transpar–µnt dayEmbed
