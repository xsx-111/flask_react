Leiyla LyricsLeiyla
I love you, Leiyla
You are my heart
My desires
I love to see (Leiyla)
Your face at night (Ah, ooh, ah)
A moonlit night
You are my life
(You are)

I want you, Leiyla (My slave)
(Leiyla)

I love you, Leiyla
I love you, Leiyla
You are my hope (You have the heart)
I love to see (Of a woman)
Your face beneath (To make)
The moonlit night (Love)
They shall succumb (Leiyla)
You are my hope (Ah, ooh)
My desire (Ah)

I love you, Leiyla
You are my heart
You are my hope (Leiyla)
I love to see (Ah, ooh)
Your face beneath (Ah)
The moon above (You will succumb)

I love you, Leiyla (To a mad)
You are my heart (Man)
My desires (Leiyla)
I love to see (Ah, ooh)
Your face beneath (Ah)
