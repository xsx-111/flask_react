1906 Lyrics
A circus light keeps flashing
A stone crumbled and fell
Steel beams snap like toothpicks
I don't feel well

Many strangers have arrived
Wearing immense black boots
Selling buttons at my door
I don't feel well


See the frightened foxes
See the hunchback in the park
He is blind and can't run for cover
I don't feel well

Hear my master's ugly voice
See the teeth marks on my leash
Only freaks know all the answers
I don't feel wellEmbed
