Will You Walk with Me Lyrics
Will you walk with me in the morning dew, my love?
Will you walk with me in the morning dew, my love?
Don't worry about the people anymore
You'll never see the people anymore

Tell me where have all the people gone?
Will you tell me where have all the people gone?
Don't worry about the people anymore
You'll never see the people anymore


Did I hear my little baby cry?
Well, did I hear my little baby cry?
Don't worry about your baby anymore
You'll never hear your baby cry again

Will you walk with me in the morning dew, my love?
Will you walk with me in the morning dew, my love?
Don't worry about the people anymore
You'll never hear your baby cry againEmbed
