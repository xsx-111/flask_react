If You Want This Love (Part One version) Lyrics
If you want this love of mine
Treat me gentle and treat me kind
Don't be mean and don't be bad
And you'll get the truest love that you ever had

If you want my lips to kiss
Cuddle close and don't resist
Loving you is all I crave
And if you let me, pretty baby, I'll be your slave

If you want this love of mine
Baby, come on and get it
If you should fall in love with me
I'll bet you will never regret it

Not a thing I wouldn't do
I'll do anything just for you
Just let me know that you're really mine
And I'll love you, pretty baby, 'til the end of time

If you want this love of mine
Treat me gentle and treat me kind
Don't be mean and don't be bad
And you'll get the truest love that you ever had

If you want my lips to kiss
Cuddle close and don't resist
Loving you is all I crave
And if you let me, pretty baby, I'll be your slave

If you want this love of mine
Baby, come on and get it
If you should fall in love with me
I'll bet you will never regret it

Not a thing I wouldn't do
I'll do anything just for you
Just let me know that you're really mine
And I'll love you, pretty baby, 'til the end of time1Embed
