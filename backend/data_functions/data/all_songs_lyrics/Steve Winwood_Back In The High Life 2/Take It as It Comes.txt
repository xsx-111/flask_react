Take It as It Comes LyricsRaise the window on another day
Take it as it comes
Just an actor waiting for a new play
Take it as it comes
Ask me to dance, I will dance for you
Ask me to sing, and see what I do
If you feel sad, I'll make jokes for you
I'm a handyman, I'm still coming through
If you suffer from a broken heart
Take it as it comes
If your lover tears your world all apart
Take it as it comes
I've played a king and a down and and out fool
Some like it hot, some like it cool
Do what they want, but don't be their tool
Savor the throne, don't mind the stool
Carry on, carry on, carry on ...
If they go too far, that's the way things are
Though it may hurt some, take it as it comes
We're all skating on the thinnest of ice
Got to take it as it comes
In a world that is not so very nice
Got to take it as it comes
Any day now the curtain may fall
All the plays end, there's no curtain call
If you live sad, or if you walk tall
We're written on a wind that's a lot to haul
Carry on, carry on, carry on ...
If they go too far, that's the way things are
Though your mind gets numb, take it as it comes
We're all skating on the thinnest of ice
Got to take it as it comes
In a world that is not so very nice
Got to take it as it comes
Any day now the curtain may fall
All the plays end, there's no curtain call
If you live sad, or if you walk tall
We're written on a wind that's a lot to haul
Carry on, carry on, carry on ...
If they go too far, that's the way things are
If they break your thumbs, take it as it comesEmbed
