Once and Never Again Lyrics19. You're only 19 for God's sake
Oh, you don't need a boyfriend
19. You're only 19 for God's sake
Oh, you don't need a boyfriend
Look what he's made you do to your arm again
He said he'd come round but he's gone out with his friends
And I know how it feels to be your age
And feel the world is caving in
Another drama by the kitchen sink tonight
You said you'd cut yourself whilst washing up the knives
Another week off school won't do you any good
And I know how it feels to be your age
19. You're only 19 for God's sake
Oh, you don't need a boyfriend
19. You're only 19 for God's sake
Oh, you don't need a boyfriend
Come back with me, and find out what you really want
Come home with me you'll only have to do it once
'Cause I know what it feels like to be your age
You only have to do it once
And never again
Another drama by the kitchen sink tonight
You said you'd cut yourself whilst washing up the knives
Another week off school won't do you any good
And I know how it feels to be your age
You know I'm not so young
I spend an hour getting ready every day
And still I end up looking more or less the same
But I could show you
A thing or two
Oh, I could show you the ropes
Yes I could show you the ropes
And I would cut my hair for you
'Cause I know how it feels
I know how it feels to be your age
I know how it feels to be your age
Oh, how I'd love to feel a girl your age
Your age
Once and never againEmbed
