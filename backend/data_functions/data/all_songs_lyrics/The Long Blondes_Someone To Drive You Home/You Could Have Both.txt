You Could Have Both LyricsI retire to bed early most nights
You follow me in or you don't
And either way, it's alright
You've been going with her now for seventeen weeks
But that doesn't make a blind bit of difference to me
Just when you're ready to take on the world
Some other girl had to get there first
And it's obvious that you're a man that's after her own heart
But you know where I am
And you know that you could have both
She's away
And you get by without her very well
When I'm around
You get by without her even better
I don't kid myself about happy endings
I'm too old for that now
Out on my doorstep, your lip burst and bleeding
Well, that was a crash course for me
You acted the film star while you were still spoken for
It didn't look rosy for me
But I've considered the alternatives
A few degrees of separation can't be that bad
Just when you're ready to take on the world
Some other girl had to get there first
And it's obvious that you're a man that's after her own heart
But you know where I am
And you know that you could have both
I wanted the world
But some other girl had to get there first
And it's obvious that you're a man that's after her own heart
But you know where I am
So stop!
"I feel like C.C. Baxter in Wilder's 'Apartment'
That particular arrangement just came out of the blue
And who was it who sang 'I know that you love one
So why can't you love two?'
I was in full-time education when I got scared of the future
And I've only got a job so I don't disappoint my mother
It's like I've painted myself into a social corner
Well, that's what happens when you listen to
Saint Scott Walker
On headphones
On the bus
What about us? What about us?
My friends come round and they ask me 'What about us?'
My friends come round and they ask me 'What about us?'
You know that I, I don't kid myself about happy endings
I'm too old for all that now
And you don't have to worry that much about the future
And it's not as if you ever did before
Because you'll always have everything just as you want it
And there'll always be a phone to ring at three in the morning
And you'll always have someone who'll drive you home
Yes, you'll always have someone, someone to drive you home
Someone to drive you home."
Just when you're ready to take on the world
Some other girl had to get there first
And it's obvious that you're a man that's after her own heart
But you know where I am
And you know what I want
And I know I'll never have you completely alone
So I'm trying to draw up a contingency plan
And it's obvious that you're a man that's after her own heart
But you know where I am
And you know that you could have both
You could have both
You could have bothEmbed
