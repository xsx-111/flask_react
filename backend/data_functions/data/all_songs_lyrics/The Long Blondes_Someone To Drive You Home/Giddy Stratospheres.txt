Giddy Stratospheres LyricsYou're pretty, oh so pretty
Why waste your time just sitting
Here listening to that dullard bitch?
Do nothing, eat your chocolate
Drink your wine, she won't let you
Make your way across her empire line
What's eating you is a mystery
But go home with her one more time
And you know you'll be history
Watch movies with the lights on
Sit still, keep her tights on
Didnâ€™t you see this one sometime last week?
Go on, say something clever
Just accept she will never
Take you higher than her attic room
What's eating you is a mystery
But go home with her one more time
And you know you'll be history
She'll never take you to giddy stratospheres
I'll confirm your fears
She'll never take you to giddy stratospheres
I'll confirm your fears
(Is she a femme fatale?)
That's what she wants you to think
(She'll never lead him astray)
But it's the best she can do
(But is she going away?)
No, she'll always be here
Waiting for you
Back here on earth
Your mother, call your mother
Even she's surprised that this is
How you want to spend your nights indoors
You never call too often
What's up? Have you forgotten
What it's like to have her on all fours?
What's eating you is a mystery
But go home with her one more time
And you know you'll be history
She'll never take you to giddy stratospheres
I'll confirm your fears
She'll never take you to giddy stratospheres
I'll confirm your fears
(Is she a femme fatale?)
That's what she wants you to think
(She'll never lead him astray)
But it's the best she can do
(But is she going away?)
No, she'll always be here
Waiting for you
Back here on earth
There's a train at
The station
It's leaving
This morning
It'll take you
Away from
This girl that's
So boring
Don't turn around, just walk away
Don't turn around, just walk away
Don't turn around, JUST WALK AWAY
She'll never take you to giddy stratospheres
I'll confirm your fears
She'll never take you to giddy stratospheres
I'll confirm your fears
(Is she a femme fatale?)
That's what she wants you to think
(She'll never lead him astray)
But it's the best she can do
(But is she going away?)
No, she'll always be here
Waiting for you
Back here on earthEmbed
