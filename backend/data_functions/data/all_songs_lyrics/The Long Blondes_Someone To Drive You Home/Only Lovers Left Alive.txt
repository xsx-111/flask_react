Only Lovers Left Alive LyricsI wouldn't bother to look if I was sure that you were happy together
But I've seen the way she covers her chest up as if it was a national treasure
Looks are the first weapon
Charm is the second
I reckon that she doesn't have much of either
You don't need her
It's better that you come and see about me
No, I won't get bored and I won't get tired
I've already spent years at the back of the line
So another six months won't make a difference to me now
Soon enough we'll be the
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
All the men came back from six years' fighting
To the beige row of houses and the prospect of spending
Their Saturday nights in
From here to eternity
And it wasn't that summer their wives didn't love them
They had the run of the house
And with nothing to do on a night
One thing led to something else
No, I won't get bored and I won't get tired
I've already spent years at the back of the line
So another six months won't make a difference to me now
Soon enough we'll be the
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Behind your back in the supermarket
She's got his number and she's not afraid to use it
I want to know, exactly what you, exactly what you intend to do about it
Because you can't keep your eye on her all the time
And you can't trust a word that she says any more
Can't trust a word that she says any more
Can't trust a word that she says any more
No, I won't get bored and I won't get tired
I've already spent years at the back of the line
So another six months won't make a difference to me now
Don't tell me what price salvation
I have to take it anyway
Can I get it on credit or something?
Godspeed the day, godspeed the day when we're the
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Left alive
Left aliveEmbed
