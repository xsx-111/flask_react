In the Company of Women LyricsIn the company of women
That's when I start to worry
What has she got that I might not
I might not
In the company of women
I must admit to being
A little bit nervous
And a little bit scared
Oh yeah
I don't need it spelling out to me
I know she's keeping him company
And I can see the signs
He likes her company better than mine
Better than mine
Teeth sponsored by Colgate
Cha-cha sponsored by Desperate Housewives
I'm scared that the difference in our lives
Will give her the start over me
But you don't fall for that type do you
That's what you told me
You wouldn't lie to my now would you?
I don't need it spelling out to me
I know she's keeping him company
And I can see the signs
He likes her company better than mine
Better than mine
I don't need it spelling out to me
I know she's keeping him company
And I can see the signs
He likes her company better than mine
And I don't need telling twice
He's happy and that's nice
But I'm waiting in the wings for you to make your first mistake
So watch out girlEmbed
