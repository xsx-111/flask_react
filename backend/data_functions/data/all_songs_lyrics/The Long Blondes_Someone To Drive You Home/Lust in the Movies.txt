Lust in the Movies Lyrics
A svelte young man, eighteen lovers to his name
Well if the rumours are true then eighteen lovers came crawling back again
I don't feel well
I've got this rattling in my chest
My doctor said that I should give it up because I'm clinically obsessed
I know you think you're in the movies
You're in the movies and you don't wanna know me
Well I know all about fear and desire, I know all about lust et cetera

Edie Sedgwick, Anna Karina, Arlene Dahl
Edie Sedgwick, Anna Karina, Arlene Dahl
I just want to be a sweetheart
I just want to be a sweetheart
I just want to be a sweetheart

A sweet young girl, dressed to the nines in Cacharel
Oh, under the weather my heels click together, and following her is hell
I feel quite ill
I've got this rattling in my chest
My doctor said that I should give it up, I need to get some rest

So never, never, never try to tell me it's a pleasure being alone
All I have here with me are the records and the books that I own
Nag, nag, nag
Nag, nag, nag
Nag, nag, nag
Nag, nag, nag
