Madame Ray LyricsGive me a Polaroid picture to fit in my pocket
And I'll paste it into my heart-shaped locket
Eventually I'll cheat on every man I meet
I know I can't help it
Buy me a drink and I will tell you my name
I'm a rose petal fallen from a mainline train
Always there to touch but just out of reach
I know you can't help it
Eye on metronome, watching the way you write her name
An object of destruction made for Madame Ray
Left New York but drew your outline
On a ticket back to London
Whitewashed all my boyfriend's features
Solarising future pictures
I'm an ideal portrait of a girl, I'll be your apprentice
But you can't keep me captive on your wall, I'm still in my twenties
Lie behind a camera past the city music hall
Madame Ray will sit me high above you all
Left New York but drew my outline
On a record sleeve in Brooklyn
Whitewashed three years of existence
Solarising future pictures
Man let go, he couldn't keep her
Locks of hair on artist's easels
Traces of unseen love rivals
Solarising into pictures
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
"With an eye always in reserve
Material indestructible
Forever being put away
Taken for a ride
Put on the spot
The racket must go on
I am always in reserve"
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserveEmbed
