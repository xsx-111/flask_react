Heaven Help the New Girl LyricsNo more nights in the flat
In the flat above the pet shop
Hiding every picture of your boyfriend
He never has to go behind my back again
Because I don't speak to him now
No more fights in the car
In the back of his car
A car that never started and the rows they never stopped
He never has to go behind my back again
Because I don't speak to him now
I say
Heaven help the new girl
If she has to go through what I went through too
Don't get me wrong
If you want someone
Who's gonna lead you on
He's the one for you
Don't get me wrong
If you want someone
Who's gonna treat you bad
He's the man
But who wants that anyway
Oh
Heaven help the new girl
If she has to go through what I went through too
Heaven help the new girl
If she has to go through what I went through too
So go
Just go
Because you'll be never 19 again
And I thought I told you before
You don't need a boyfriend
So go
Just walk
It doesn't matter if its raining or dark
And if by some strange stroke of luck
I pick you up
Then we can drive to the country
Left to ourselves
And both say
Heaven help the new girl
If she has to go through what I went through tooEmbed
