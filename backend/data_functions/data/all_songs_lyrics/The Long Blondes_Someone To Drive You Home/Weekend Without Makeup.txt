Weekend Without Makeup LyricsAnother weekend without makeup
Another evening to myself
Well, I guess that I won't be having the time of my life tonight
Where do you go when you've finished work?
You should have been home an hour ago
I've got your tea laid out like some kind of fifties housewife
Well I'll feed you
But I need you
To make a little more effort
I don't like giving you the third degree
I just want what's due, what's due to me...
There are wants and there are needs
And they're two very different things
You can love or be in love, again
They're two very different things
Yes, they're two very different things
I want to talk but you're much too tired
You've got a job but if you don't get fired soon
I'll be extremely surprised
Where do you go when you've finished work?
You should have been home an hour ago
You've left me fashioning a double bed
And acting like some kind of fifties housewife
There are wants and there are needs
And they're two very different things
You can love or be in love, again
They're two very different things
Yes, they're two very different things
I could be more than your land lady if you like
But you don't like
And neither do I!
There are wants and there are needs
And they're two very different things
You can love or be in love, again
They're two very different things
Yes, they're two very different things
You and I, we're different
You and I, we're two very different things
But still I've got you, I've got you under my skin
But still I've got you, I've got you under my skinEmbed
