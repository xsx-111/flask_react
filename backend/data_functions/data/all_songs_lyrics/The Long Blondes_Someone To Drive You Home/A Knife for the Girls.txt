A Knife for the Girls LyricsYou gave me a chance at the palais de danse to prove I'm worth your time...
You gave me a chance to prove I'm more than just an also ran...
A knife for the girls who want to come home for just one night
A knife for the girls who never return your calls
You gave me a chance at the palais de danse to prove I'm worth your time
You gave me a chance to prove I'm more than just an also ran
Something happened to change your mind
Something happened I don't know why
And now you reach for my hand and you cut me again
You've got a knife for the girls and a knife for the men
I don't mind seeing your face around, but we can never speak again (no no no)
A knife for the men who've taken the heat off you this time
A knife for the men who keep you awake at night
This could be the last time you could say for sure
You know I'm here if you need a girl...
Something happened to change your mind
Something happened I don't know why
And now you reach for my hand and you cut me again
You've got a knife for the girls and a knife for the men
I don't mind seeing your face around, but we can never speak again (no no no)
But in a back room in Harehills
When you said I was a superstar
What did you mean, what did you mean?
Harehills
Harehills
Harehills
Well in a back room in Harehills, what did you mean?
And now you reach for my hand and you cut me again
You've got a knife for the girls and a knife for the men
I don't mind seeing your face around, but we can never speak again
I got my souvenir
I got my souvenir
Well in a back room in Harehills, I got my souvenir
My baby doll, don't go to London
Don't go to London, no no no
Don't go to London
Don't go to London, no no no
Don't go to London
Don't go to London, no no no
Don't go to London
Don't go to London, no no noEmbed
