Swallow Tattoo LyricsGive me a good film noir and a bottle of gin
I'll be happy just to stay inside
I didn't want to get too involved
But I like how hard you tried
To my horror
A former lover told me you've always had a swallow tattoo
Now you tell me it's a sign of devotion
But devotion to who?
Don't think I'm a martyr to the cause
She's got her reasons putting cats amongst the pigeons
But I'd rather just stay indoors
An antique emblem set in ink
It didn't mean a thing to you
Now I've been wronged by proxy
Goodbye, happiness, I hardly knew ya
To my horror
A former lover told me you've always had a swallow tattoo
Now you tell me it's a sign of devotion
But devotion to who?
You fill me, you fill me
You fill me with inertia
You fill me with inertia
I still want, I still want to jump
I want to jump your bones
Don't tell her, tell her anything
Because I'm bound to see her later today
And if she can't keep a straight face
Then I'll know
To my horror
A former lover told me you've always had a swallow tattoo
Now you tell me it's a sign of devotion
But devotion to who?
I'd rather just stay indoorsEmbed
