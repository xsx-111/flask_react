Observer Lyrics
I could stand here for days
Or I could stand here for hours
I could stand here for a lifetime
Watching you and waiting always
I could observe you all

I could wait for a day
Or I could wait for an hour
I could wait here for a lifetime
Watching you and thinking always
I could observe you all1Embed
