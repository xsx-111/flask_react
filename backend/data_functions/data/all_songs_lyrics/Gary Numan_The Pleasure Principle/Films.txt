Films Lyrics
I don't like the film
I don't like the film
Play it all back
Play it all back
And I don't like the scenery
And I don't like the set so
Pull it all down
Pull it all down
But I like the actors
And I like the show

We're so exposed
We're so exposed
Anything can happen
Anything can happen
And don't let them see
And don't let them know
And you wonder why
And you wonder why
Turn off the lights
And turn off the soundEmbed
