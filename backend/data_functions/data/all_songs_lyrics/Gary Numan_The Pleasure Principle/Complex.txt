Complex Lyrics
They won't come back
You know it's always the same
And they're sure to forget
Saying, "Everyone lies"

So I'm down to this
I'm down to walking on air
And you're here by my side
With all your waving and smiles

Please keep them away
Don't let them touch me
Please don't let them lie
Don't let them see me1Embed
