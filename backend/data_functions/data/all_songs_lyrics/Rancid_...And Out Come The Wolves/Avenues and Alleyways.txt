Avenues and Alleyways Lyrics
I figured out the problem, yeah the problem is you
You didn't see us comin', now there's nothin' you can do
Times are gonna change, so change or step aside
It's a point of view that took you by surprise

The sun's coming up, yeah the new dawn arrives
New generation standing, stand with anger in their eyes
No love in the city 'cause there's no connection
Been stricken with disease, a racial infection

I'm a battering ram comin' through to you
In every alleyway, on every avenue

Actions could erase all the fear that we suffer
People segregated, no one understands each other
He's a different color but we're the same kin
I'll treat him like my brother, he'll treat me like his

Well an eye for an eye, yeah a tooth for a tooth
Brother against brother, should be singin' with the group
The inner cities burnin', yeah it's screamin' black and blue
The power and the passion of a million youth
I'm a battering ram comin' through to you
In every alleyway on every avenue

I figured out the problem, yeah the problem is you
You didn't see us comin', now there's nothin' you can do
He's a different color but we're the same kin
I'll treat him like my brother, he'll treat me like his

All the blood that spills of all the guts that fly
The media paints a picture that stings all our eyes
Pits the dogs against the cats, now who is responsible?
The power in the issue, the force is unstoppableEmbed
