Lock, Step and Gone LyricsThe end isn't here, there's something wrong
But it's coming real soon, I lock, step, I'm gone
I said the feeling isn't fear, there's something wrong
It's just telling you to move, I lock, step, I'm gone
There's a fire on the corner and it's never gonna stop
Killer in the neighborhood, never got caught
I lock up my door, step out and I'm gone
Waiting for the buses but the buses won't come
All the docks are quiet, there's something wrong
And there's no ships coming in, I lock, step, I'm gone
Where there once was a riot, there's something wrong
There's a whole lot of nothing, I lock, step, I'm gone
Stop sign broken and the meter's going down
Wild dogs are running themselves into the ground
Everything was clear for that moment in time
If I don't come back, well, throw me a line
Oh, the end isn't here
But it's coming real soon
The feeling isn't fear
It's just telling you to move, go
Come, stop
Go
Stop sign broken and the meter's going down
Wild dogs are running themselves into the ground
Everything was clear for that moment in time
If I don't go back, well, throw me a line
All the docks are quiet, there's something wrong
And there's no ships coming in, I lock, step, I'm gone
Where there once was a riot, there's something wrong
There's a whole lot of nothing, I lock, step, I'm gone
There's a whole lot of nothing, there's something wrong
There's a whole lot of nothing, I lock, step, I'm gone
There's a whole lot of nothing, there's something wrong
There's a whole lot of nothing, I lock, step, I'm goneEmbed
