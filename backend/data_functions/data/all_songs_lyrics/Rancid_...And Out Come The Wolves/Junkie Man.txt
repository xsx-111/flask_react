Junkie Man Lyrics
The common man doesn't suffer pain like this
Only the sort that has never been kissed
Let us adore our beautiful son
He's ridin' on the rivers of Babylon
Burnin' up, shootin' up bring on the brightness
See the son of god is comin' up and I see a likeness
Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin'
When you're brought up you're caught up in a system that's goin'
No one answers no one takes that call from you
Junkie man tell me what your story is...
What do, what do, what do, what do I desire
Some parent's house is on fire
Slowly the house gonna burn to the ground
The neighborhood will watch without a sound
Will someone be a witness please tell me that he's crazy
But he's not and they know that and they can't get him cause he's not crazy
Beat lock him knock him take him away his authority
Hit 'em, ship 'em, club 'em submitted conformity
No one answers no one takes that call from you
Junkie man tell me what your story is...
My hand went blind
You were in the vein clairvoyant
You were in the vein clairvoyant
My hand went blind
I make love to my transistor, my trance sister
And my transparency from the balcony
I looked out on the big field, on the big field
It opens like the cover of an old bible
And out come the wolves, out come the wolves
Their paws trampling in the snow the alphabet
I stand on my head and watch it all go away

Burnin' up, shootin' up an bring on the brightness
See the son of god is comin' up and there is a likeness
Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin' when
You're brought up and caught up in a system that is goin'Embed
