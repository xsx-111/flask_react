Old Friend Lyrics
Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again
Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again

Look up you're in Cleveland again
A solid line that never ends
I've got stories that you'll never believe
And I know it I wear, I wear it on my sleeve
There must've been somethin' bout you that I liked
But right here in the rain, you know it just don't seem right
I always go out, I never hide
But in Cleveland I should have stayed inside

Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again
Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again
Testify my love for you
And I know it runs deep through your body too
From the cold blacktop to the hot concrete
The old tan van it ain't so sweet

Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again
Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again

Somewhere in America in the city at night
We were far from home but you know it was gonna be alright

The unfortunate get preyed on by vultures eyes
Eighty-six cents in these pockets of mine
And you can take my money, you can take my time
But you can't take my heart, it's in the city behind

Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again
Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again1Embed
