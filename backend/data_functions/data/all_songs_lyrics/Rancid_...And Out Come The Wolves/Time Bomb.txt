Time Bomb Lyrics
If you wanna make a move then you better come in
It's just the ability to reason that wears so thin
Livin' and dyin' and the stories that are true
Secrets to a good life's knowing when you're through

Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb

Well, he's back in the hole where they got him living
Like a rat but he's smarter than that nine lives
Like a cat fifteen years old take him to the youth authority home
First thing you learn you gotta make it in this world alone

Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb

Now he's gotten out, he gotten free, he gotta go, gotta car
He's twenty-one years old, he's runnin' numbers from the bar
His pager's beepin', he's got in deep in
Whatever he can move on in you know that kid's a creepin'
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
The boy's a time bomb
(Yeah) The boy's a time bomb
Tears come from the razor that's been tattooed below his eye
His mother cries, she knows that he is strong enough to die
He's rollin' in the Cadillac, it's midnight sunroof is down
Three shots rung out the hero's dead, the new king is crowned

Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Ohh, time bomb!2Embed
