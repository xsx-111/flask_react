As Wicked LyricsI saw an old man on the street
He was in a dumpster, lookin' for somethin' to eat
He moved so slow like a dyin' dream
Like a machinist who got caught in the machine
I saw this lady and she was cryin'
She said it's hard when someone you love is dyin'
I saw this kid who was about 5 years old
He was in the park all alone, he was cold
There's something coming around
As wicked as it may seem
As wicked as anything could be
As wicked as it may seem
As wicked as anything could be
I know this girl she's barely alive
She's all haggard she's only twenty-five
She said she never had a friend before
I said, "Hey girl, I'll be your friend, but who's keepin' score?"
I saw this other little girl on the phone
Her mother comforts her, far far from home
The little girl's very hesitant
Her best friend lie dead on the pavement
There's something coming around
As wicked as it may seem
As wicked as anything could be
As wicked as it may seem
As wicked as anything could be
I always end up back on the hill
Lookin' down at the landfill
I always go there when I can
My friend Marty said, "Tim you're a lucky man"
There's something coming around
As wicked as it may seem
As wicked as anything could be
As wicked as it may seem
As wicked as anything could beEmbed
