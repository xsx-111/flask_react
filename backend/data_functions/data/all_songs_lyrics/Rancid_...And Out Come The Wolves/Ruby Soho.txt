Ruby Soho Lyrics
Echoes of reggae comin' through my bedroom wall
Having a party up next door but I'm sittin here all alone
Two lovers in the bedroom and the other starts to shout
All I got is this blank stare and that don't carry no clout at all

Destination unknown
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho
Destination unknown
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho

He's singing and she's there to lend a hand
He's seen his name on the marquee but she will never understand
Once again he's leavin' and she's there with a tear in her eye
Embraces with a warm gesture it's time, time to say goodbye

Destination unknown
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho
Destination unknown
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho

Ruby's heart ain't beatin' cause she knows the feelin' is gone
She's not the only one who knew there's somethin' wrong
Her lover's in the distance as she wipes a tear from her eye
Ruby's fading out, she disappears, it's time, time to say goodbye
Destination unknown
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho
Destination unknown
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho

Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho

Destination unknown (Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho)
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho
Destination unknown (Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho)
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho5Embed
