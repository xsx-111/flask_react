The 11th Hour LyricsHey little sister do you know what time it was
When you finally seen all your broken dreams
Come crashing down your door
They demand an answer and they demand it quick
Or the questions fade and the wasted days
Come crawling back for more
And I said, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
The face of isolation
Well that's one you recognize
When you can't get straight
It's a lonely place and
It's one you do despise
Boredom is for sale now
And the helplessness you feel
Is a wounded dove and the hawks are above
Blood splattered on a reel to reel
And I said, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
I was almost over, my world was almost gone
In a sudden rush I could almost touch
The things that I'd done wrong
My jungle's made of concrete
Through the silence I could feel
That my aim is true and I will walk on through
These mountains made of steel
And I say, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
Oh, it starts and ends with you
It starts and ends with you1Embed
