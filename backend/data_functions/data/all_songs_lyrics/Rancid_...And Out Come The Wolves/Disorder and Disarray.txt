Disorder and Disarray Lyrics
Business man come shake my hand
Show me numbers that I understand
You're my candle, I'm your burnin' wick
Two sides comin' in quick
Say goodbye when you see me sign

Now I'm crucified
Crucify-y-y me, crucify-y-y me
Crucify-y-y me, crucify-y-y me
Yeah

The ground's fertile and the grass is green
So many things are bein' seen
So many bands are bein' heard
Just for once can I be ignored?
Say goodbye when you see me sign

Now I'm crucified
Crucify-y-y me, crucify-y-y me
Crucify-y-y me, crucify-y-y me
Yeah
Hey man it's cool I say
I'm gonna get away
No no no no reason for me to stay
But I'll come back another day
Get on the Bus and
Got no money
Driver say, "Hey that ain't enough man"
I say, "What the fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Say goodbye when you see me sign

Now I'm crucified
Crucify-y-y me, crucify-y-y me
Crucify-y-y me, crucify-y-y me
Yeah

Business man come shake my hand
Show me numbers that I understand
You're my candle, I'm your burnin' wick
Two sides comin' in quick
Say goodbye when you see me sign

Now I'm crucified
Crucify-y-y me, crucify-y-y me
Crucify-y-y me, crucify-y-y me
 "Ohh, what the people say
We're caught up in the disarray"
 "Well the look on their face when we drop the bomb"
 "Ha, ha yeah Tim lets play along"

Crucify-y-y me, crucify-y-y me
Crucify-y-y me, crucify-y-y meEmbed
