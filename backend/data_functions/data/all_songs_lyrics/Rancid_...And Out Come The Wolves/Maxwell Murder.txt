Maxwell Murder LyricsMaxwell can't tell he's in Hell
He just wants you to visit him there
Same old game that he's playing
His rules are never fair
Nobody want to look back
Everybody want to get high tonight before they run out of time
Where's the felon, the chargeable felon
The name of the crook who committed the crime

9-9-9 if you really want the truth
Dial 9-9-9 if you can't see it through
He ain't Jack the Ripper, he's your ordinary crook
Call it Maxwell murder for you
Maxwell got a hand in this plan
He knows who you are in this plan
Shop the rock before you bought it
Sickness Maxwell knows you caught it
Nobody want to look back
Everybody want to get high tonight before they run out of time
Where's the felon, the chargiale felon
The name of the crook who committed the crime
9-9-9 if you really want the truth
Dial 9-9-9 if you can't see it through
He ain't Jack the Ripper, he's your ordinary crook
Call it Maxwell murder for you
Oh Max, you motherfucker

Dial 9-9-9 if you really want the truth
Dial 9-9-9 if you can't see it through
He ain't Jack the Ripper, he's your ordinary crook
Call it Maxwell murder for youEmbed
