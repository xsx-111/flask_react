The Wars End Lyrics
Little Sammy was a punk rocker
You know his mother never understand him
Went into his room and smashed his Billy Bragg record
Didn't want him to hear that communist lecture
And little Sammy was a punk rocker
You know his mother tried to take him to war

War, Sammy, now the war is over
War, Sammy, now we're at the war's end
We're at the war's end, we're at the war's end
We're at the war's end, we're at the war's end, go

Little Sammy was a punk rocker
Now it's time for you to leave home

War, Sammy, now the war is over
War, Sammy, now we're at the war's end
We're at the war's end, we're at the war's end
Yeah yeah yeah, we're at the end
We're at the war's endEmbed
