Olympia, WA Lyrics
Hangin' out with Lars down on 6th Street
He knew that I was in trouble
I was feelin' much like the devil
There was something burnin' deep inside of me
Ran into three Puerto Ricans
These girls took us to the fun house
Where we played a lonely pinball machine

Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway
Cars passin' by but none of 'em seem to go my way
An' New York City, well I wish I was on a highway
Back to Olympia

I'm havin' a hard time understandin'
It gets all too demandin'
She's all gone and I'm stranded
Sumpin' burnin' deep inside of me
All I know it's 4'o'clock, eh
She ain't even showed up, eh
I watched a thousand people go home from work
Yeah

Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway
Cars passin' by but none of 'em seem to go my way
An' New York City, well I wish I was on a highway
Back to Olympia

How many times will it take me
Before I go crazy?
Before I lose everything?
Sumpin' burnin' deep inside of me
Ran into three Puerto Ricans
These girls took us to the fun house
I don't wanna be alone again

Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway
An cars passin' by but none of 'em seem to go my way
An' New York City, well I wish I was on a highway
