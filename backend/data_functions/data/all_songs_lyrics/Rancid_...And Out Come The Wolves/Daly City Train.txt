Daly City Train Lyrics
He was an artist and a writer
And a poet and a friend
In a man's life he will take a fall
But how low he goes it just depends
Yeah, he's shooting dope in the men's room
At the station Daly City Train
Have you ever seen an angel, well I know I have
Say they'll stay here for a while and they'll fly away

Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I'd seen him
But when he rolled the dice he know he never thought twice
Never thought twice about being

Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I'd seen him
But when he rolled the dice he know he never thought twice
Never thought twice about being

Some grown up and some grow old
But what about the kid who never learned the rules
Spent all these years on this earth
When you look back it's just a flicker of time
Jackyl was one of the one's that perished
Yeah, he was one of the one's that was already saved
Through all this evil and wreckage, yeah
He maintained a sense of himself, yeah

Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I'd seen him
But when he rolled the dice he know he never thought twice
Never thought twice about being
Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I'd seen him
But when he rolled the dice he know he never thought twice
Never thought twice about being

Take it
Some men are in prison even though
They walk the streets at night
Other men who got the lock down
Are free as a bird in flight

How about the hour
In the system that ended
In a one-way line
Our measures could not stand it
Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I'd seen him
But when he rolled the dice he know he never thought twice
Never thought twice about being him
Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I'd seen him
But when he rolled the dice he know he never thought twice
Never thought twice about being him3Embed
