Straw Dogs Lyrics(Fingers/Ogilvie)
All things are relative with cousins everywhere
Hard-nosed blue-eyed boys, intelligent and fair
You gotta pitch in for your kith and kin
Holding the line to save our skin
Pound for pound we'll take the shilling
It takes a man to make a killing
Action men must sterling be
Fight for freedom but not for free
(Chorus:)
Bark and bite, might is right
We're the dogs of war
Bark and bite, might is right
If the price is right....Dogs of straw
So let's go far to the new frontier
It's in the blood defending near and dear
Action men must sterling be
Fight for freedom but not for free
(Chorus)
A man must do what he must do
To prove what life is all about
Admit you must admire our guts
If only cos they're hanging out
(Chorus)
Dogs of straw, bark and bite
Dogs of straw, might is right
Dogs of straw, stab and hate
Dogs of straw, split and rape
Dogs of straw, gouge and blind
Dogs of straw, crunch and grind
Dogs of straw, mash and maim
Dogs of straw, cash and fame
Dogs of straw, cut and kill
Dogs of straw, guts for saleEmbed
