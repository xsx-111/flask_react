No Change LyricsWhy do you talk that way?
It's not what you used to say
Can't you see things my way?
I feel so strange
I'm still the friend you knew
Surely you know it's true?
Why can't I get it through
That there's no change
One day things were oh so right
But all that changed overnight
And now it seems that all we do is fight
Why should things be different now?
I try to talk but you just row
It seem that's how you want it anyhow
Why can't you just see
It's you who's changed not me?
Those thoughts are in your head
They're not real
But you still talk that way
That's all you'll ever say
You'll never see things my way
I feel so strange
I'm still the friend you knew
Tho' you can't see it's true
Why don't you get it through
That there's no changeEmbed
