Just Like Honey Lyrics
Listen to the girl as she takes on half the world
Moving up and so alive in her honey dripping beehive, beehive
It's good, so good
It's so good, so good

Walking back to you is the hardest thing that I can do
That I can do for you, for you

I'll be your plastic toy
I'll be your plastic toy, for you

Eating up the scum is the hardest thing for me to do

Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey4Embed
