Never Understand Lyrics
The sun comes up, another day begins
And I don't even worry about the state I'm in
My head's so heavy and I'm looking thin
But when the sun goes down I'm gonna start again
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh

You're never understanding
You never understand me, yeah
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh

Stop, turn around and take a look at me
Why don't you take a close look and tell me what you see
The things I say, you only disagree
You'll never understand, that's what I want to be
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
You're never understanding
You never understand me, yeah
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh

Looking so hard but you just can't see me
I tell you the truth but you don't believe me
You're thinking out loud but can't hear what you're saying
Tomorrow I'm leaving 'cause I'm not staying, yeah
'Cause I'm not staying, yeah
'Cause I'm not staying, yeah
'Cause I'm not staying, yeah
