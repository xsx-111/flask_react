Sowing Seeds LyricsI see people going down
All God's people going down
And I should not be alone
Yeah, I should be on my phone
Yes, I should be on my phone
Yes, I should be on my phone
I'll go where that apple goes
I touch with an apple touch
I see people
Candy people
I'm sowing seeds
I'm sowing seeds
I feel as sharp as a carving knife
So I feel in love for the very last time
I'm sick of the beating by everyone
I'm sick of the beating by everyone
I want peace
I want peace
I want peace
I want peace
I'm sowing seeds
I'm sowing seeds
I'm sowing seeds
I'm sowing seeds
I'm sowing seeds2Embed
