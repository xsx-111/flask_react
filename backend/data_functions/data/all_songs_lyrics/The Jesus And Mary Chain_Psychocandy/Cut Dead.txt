Cut Dead LyricsWhat can I do
It's gotten me beaten black and blue
Why don't you know
You got me moving much too slow
Why can't you see
You got me chasing honey bees
You made me fall
Broke me up and took it all
Call me your messed up boy
Just what I've found
You knock my body to the ground
Just what I've said
You're tearing up my weary head
Do I still shine
After such a lonely time
You cut me dead
You nail me down and kick my head
Cut dead your messed up boy
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey2Embed
