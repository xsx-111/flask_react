Just Out of Reach LyricsTake a walk, to the beach
Take a walk, back to the sea
Take a walk with me, back to the beach
I take a walk with you, just out of reach
Just out of reach (x4)
I see the sun here
I see the sand
I see the sun here
You take my hand (x4)
* ? * sand
Just out of reach(x4)
You take a walk with me, back to the sea
You take a walk with me, back to the beach
Just out of reach (x4)
I see the sun on you
I see the sand
I see the sun on you
You take my hand (x3)
Back to the sandEmbed
