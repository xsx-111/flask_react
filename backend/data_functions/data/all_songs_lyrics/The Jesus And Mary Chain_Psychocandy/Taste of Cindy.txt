Taste of Cindy LyricsCrack of dawn
Cindy's moving on
Talking Cindy to everyone
Till she's had her fun
She and me
We twist the sun and sea
Still, she's talking to everyone
Cindy's had her fun
Though I've heard it before
Still, I need it more and more
But I just can't get away
Cindy kills me every day
And I tried and I tried but she looked right through me
Knife to my head when she talks so sweetly
Knife in my head when I think of Cindy
Knife in my head is the taste of Cindy2Embed
