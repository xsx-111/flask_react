Head LyricsWalk away
You empty head
You're late she says
Is blonds
Hey
You're a blonde, hey
So you knock at the door
Is it the beat of your heart
Your cold empty heart
Your cold empty heart
I think you're crawling up my spine
I think you're crawling up my spine
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Don't want you to stay
Want you to stay
Hey
Walk away
You empty head
You're late she said
Is blonds
Hey
You're a blonde, hey
So the knives on the street
There's a man on your cross
Your cold empty cross
Your cold empty cross
I think you're crawling up my spine
I think you're crawling up my spine
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Want you to stay
Don't want you to stay
Hey
I walk away
I walk away
I walk away from your head
Off your head
Off your head
Hey, from your head
I walk
I walk
I walk
Your head
Your head
From your head
From your head
From your head
From your headEmbed
