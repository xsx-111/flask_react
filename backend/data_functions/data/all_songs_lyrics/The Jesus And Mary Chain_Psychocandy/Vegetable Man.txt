Vegetable Man LyricsIn yellow shoes, I get the blues
So I walk the streets with my plastic feet
My blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt, I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
But oh, oh, my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man, where are you?
So I change my gear and I find my knees
And I cover them up with the latest cut
And my pants and socks all point in a box
And they don't take long for my nylon socks
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole
And all that lot is what I got
It's what I wear, it's what you see
It must be me, it's what I am
Vegetable man
Ha, ha ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha, ha ha ha, ha ha ha
I've been looking all over the place for a place for me
But it ain't anywhere, it just ain't anywhere
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
It's the kind of fun where you just gotta see me if you can
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
Vegetable man

It's the kind of fun where you just gotta see me if you can
