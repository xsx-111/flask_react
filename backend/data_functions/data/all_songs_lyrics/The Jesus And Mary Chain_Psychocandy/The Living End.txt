The Living End Lyrics
I get ahead on my motorbike
I get ahead on my motorbike
I feel so quick in my leather boots
I feel so quick in my leather boots
My mood is black when my jacket's on
My mood is black when my jacket's on

And I'm in love with myself
And I'm in love with myself
There's nothing else but me
There's nothing else but me
And an empty road
And a cool, cool wind and it makes feel so good
Just like I knew it would
Just like I knew it would

I get so wild on my motorbike
I get so wild on my motorbike
I'm breaking loose on this moonlit night
I'm breaking loose on this moonlit night
I cut the road like a sharpened knife
I cut the road like a sharpened knife
And I'm in love with myself
And I'm in love with myself
There's nothing else but me
There's nothing else but me
And an empty road
And a cool, cool wind makes me feel so good

I'm moving too fast, (I'm moving too fast)
I'm moving so fast that I can't control the wheels
I'm moving so fast, (I'm moving so fast)
Yeah, I'm going for a tree, yeah it's going for me, yeah
My head is dripping into my leather bootsEmbed
