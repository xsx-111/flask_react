My Little Underground LyricsRunning away
I got something to say
You're in my way
So goodbye yesterday
I'm gonna run and find
A place where I can hide
Somewhere that no one knows
Someplace that no one goes
So don't you look for me
I'll be where you can't see
Somewhere I can't be found
My little underground
It's easy to see
That you're laughing at me
No guarantee
At least none I can see
And it's cold outside
Doesn't work out right
Gonna stay inside
Gonna stay inside
I'm gonna run and find
A place where I can hide
Somewhere that no one knows
Someplace that no one goes
So don't you look for me
I'll be where you can't see
Somewhere I can't be found
My little underground
Sun shines so high
Bright in the sky
Sun shines so
Sun shines so
Sun shines so high above
And it's cold outside
And it's cold outside
Doesn't work out right
Gonna stay inside
And I can't
Can't understand it
Don't know why
Don't know why
Just can't
Can't understand it
Don't know why
Don't know why
And it's cold outside
Doesn't work out right2Embed
