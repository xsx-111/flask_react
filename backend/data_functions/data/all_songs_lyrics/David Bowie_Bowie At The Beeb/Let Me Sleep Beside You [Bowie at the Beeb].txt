Let Me Sleep Beside You  LyricsBaby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
Now the years of threading daisies lie behind you
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and beads
I will show you games where the winner never wins
Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will hold a lighted lamp and we shall walk together
Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine
That it could happen this way, could you?
I will show you games where the winner never wins
Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside youEmbed
