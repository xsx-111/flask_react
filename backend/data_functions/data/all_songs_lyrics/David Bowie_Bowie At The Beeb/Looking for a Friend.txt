Looking for a Friend LyricsHmm ah (giggle)
Gather round all you people
Watch me while you can
I've been trawling too long
I've been losing out strong
For the strength of another man
I've been hasty, wasty
Sitting on the backstep
Waiting for the phone to ring]
This semi-acoustic love affair
Is driving me to the brink
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
God help all you ladies
May the devil take all you men
You're far too busy having babies
To help yourselves to a friend
You're lazy, crazy
Hung upon the insane
Standing with your back to the wall]
My pretty has a picture, oh-so nice
Hoping that you might call
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Hey
Hey looking
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
Oh, you don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Looking
Just a-cruising
Vulgar
Just looking (giggle)
Don't have to be a big wheel
Don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Oh yeah (etc.)Embed
