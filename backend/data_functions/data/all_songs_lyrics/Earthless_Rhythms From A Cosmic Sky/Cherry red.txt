Cherry red LyricsAll night long, I loved her
Morning came to soon
I knew she'd be gone by the afternoon
I said "Please don't go!"
Still she said goodbye
But as she turned around she had a glad look in her eye
But as she turned around she had a glad look in her eye
But as she turned around she had a glad look in her eye
And I thought it said
When you *learn how to see me alternative - yearn now?
You turn right in your bed
The warmth of my body will heat you
Make your blood run cherry red
Cherry red, cherry red
All next day I waited for a time
But she didn't show
Until I turned to the dark of night
I said "Please come soon!"
Still there was no sign
But as the? to the lie
As the? to the lie, as the? to the lie1Embed
