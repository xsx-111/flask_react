Depressed Beyond Tablets LyricsI walk caverns and abysmals
That I hope you never dream of
I search around for exits
But I'm doubting that there ever was an entrance
In the first place
It's as bleak as the boondock where Stern-Faced Neubauten rehearsed
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
The sunshine and Jennifer
Seem such a distance
The universe is ruled
By chance and indifference
And I'm shrouded
By inexorable darkness
And I'll tell you this for nowt
La Belle Epoque sang "Black Is Black"
Yeah, well I sing black is black is black is blacker
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
The cloud base is low on the Clwydian Hills
While she's squealing with pleasure
In the arms of her lover
To infernal regions
I've been sent to gut hummingbirds
According
To my sentence
Your optimism strikes me like junk mail addressed to the dead
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
Oh the results of my lifetime are a string of nil-nils
Hey, Blakey, does your bus go by the Dark Satanic Mills?
If I was in CSNY, I'd be Stephen Stills
And maybe four more without the numerous frills
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
Depressed beyond tablets, I'm gone beyond pills
I'm DBT, GBP
I'm depressed beyond tablets, gone beyond pillsEmbed
