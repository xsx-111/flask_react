Go! Lyrics
This is Apollo Control at 102 hours into the flight of Apollo 11
It's grown quite quiet here in Mission Control
A few moments ago flight director Gene Kranz requested that everyone sit down
Get prepared for events that are coming
And he closed with a remark of good luck to all of you

12 minutes now until ignition for powered descent
Everything's still looking very good at this point

OK, all flight controllers go-no-go for powered descent

Retro? Go
FIDO? Go
Guidance? Go
Control? Go
TELCOM? Go
GNC? Go
EECOM? Go
Surgeon? Go

CAPCOM we're go for powered descent
We're off to a good start, play it cool

OK flight controllers, I'm going around the horn
OK...

Retro? Go
FIDO? Go
Guidance? Go
Control? Go
TELCOM? Go
GNC? Go
EECOM? Go
Surgeon? Go

CAPCOM we're go for landing
OK everybody lets hang tight, look for the landing radar
75 feet. Down a half
12 02 alarm
60 seconds
We're... we're GO on that, Flight
We're GO on that alarm?
30 feet down, 2 and a half
It's... If it doesn't reoccur, we'll be GO
30 seconds
12 01
12 01
Roger, 12 01 alarm
12 01 alarm
Same type, we're GO, Flight
Ok, we're go
We've had shutdown
Houston, Tranquility Base here, The Eagle has landed

OK, keep the chatter down in this room
T1, standby for T1
Stay-no-stay all flight controllers:
Retro? Stay

Guidance? Stay
Control? Stay
