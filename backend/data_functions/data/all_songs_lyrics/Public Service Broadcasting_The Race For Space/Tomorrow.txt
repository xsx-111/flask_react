Tomorrow Lyrics
Here man completed his first exploration of the Moon, December 1972 A.D
May the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind
This valley of history has seen mankind complete its first evolutionary steps into the Universe
I think no more significant contribution has Apollo made to history
It's not often you can foretell history, but I think we can in this case and I think everybody ought to feel very proud of that fact

This is our commemoration that will be here until someone like us
'Til some of you who are out there who are the promise of the future
Come back to read it again
And as I take man's last step from the surface
Back home for some time to come
But we believe not too long into the future
I'd like to just let what I believe history will record
That America's challenge of today
Has forged man's destiny of tomorrow
And as we leave the Moon at Taurus-Littrow
We leave as we came, and God willing, as we shall return
With peace and hope, for all mankind
Godspeed the crew of Apollo 17Embed
