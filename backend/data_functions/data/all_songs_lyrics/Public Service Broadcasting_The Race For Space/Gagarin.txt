Gagarin LyricsГоворит Москва
This is Moscow
This is Moscow calling
On the 12th of April, the Soviet Union orbited a spaceship around the Earth with a man on board
The astronaut is a Soviet citizen: Major Gagarin, Yuri Alekseevich
(Gagarin, Yuri Alekseevich)
The world's first cosmonaut
The first to open the door into the unknown
The first to step over the threshold of our homeland
(Gagarin, Yuri Alekseevich)
The whole planet knew him and loved him
Gagarin!
Was it hazardous? Yes, it was
The first strides into the unknown were about to be made
(Gagarin, Yuri Alekseevich)
The hero who blazed the trail for the stars
Every one of us was with Yuri Gagarin as he orbited the Earth 190 miles above us
Astronaut to Earth: I can see forests, rivers, cumulus clouds all around
Everything's so beautiful, it's wonderful, it's wonderful...
The whole planet knew him and loved him

Gagarin!1Embed
