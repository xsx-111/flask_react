Sputnik LyricsThis is the beginning of a new era for mankind
The era of man's cosmic existence
You will now hear the voice of the Russian moon
Russian moon, moon, moon...

All over the world, people are tuning in to the 'bleep bleep bleep' of the satellite
A dream cherished by men for many centuries comes true on October the 4th, 1957
The man made celestial body, for the first time in history
Overcame terrestrial gravity and flew into space
All men of all nations recognise this as a great achievement
In an age where the race to conquer space has become an all-absorbing factor
The era of man's cosmic existence
Will the bleep of the satellite bring people closer together in a common understanding?
All of the Earth shrinks, the universe stretches forth its beckoning hand in a gesture to all mankind
To all mankind, to all mankind...
