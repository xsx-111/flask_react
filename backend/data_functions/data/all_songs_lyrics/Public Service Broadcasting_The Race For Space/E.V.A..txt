E.V.A. LyricsAnd now, a new breakthrough in ace conquests
For the first time, the spaceman was to leave the ship and step out into open space
The first one to do this was Alexey Leonov
Everything is ready, let's go
Everything is strange and unusual in this new world
There's no support: no top, no bottom
Everything is weightless
Everything is weightless
Orientation is lost
Go back to the 


I'm on the edge of the opening
Of the airlock chamber
I feel excellent
I see clouds and the sea
I am beginning to move away
A man in space
He's walking in space
He's walking in space
There's no support: no top, no bottom
Everything is weightless
He's walking in space...
He's walking in space...
10 minutes in open space
10 minutes that shook the world
