The Race for Space LyricsWe meet in an hour of change and challenge
In a decade of hope and fear
In an age of both knowledge and ignorance
The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds
The eyes of the world are now looking to space
To the moon, and to the planets beyond
And we have vowed
That we shall not see it governed
By a hostile flag of conquest
But by a banner of freedom and peace
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things
Not because they are easy, but because they are hard
Many years ago, Great British explorer George Mallory
Who was to die on Mount Everest
Was asked 'why did he want to climb it?'
He said 'because it is there'
Well space is there and we're going to climb it
And the moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore as we set sail we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure
On which man has ever embarked
