The Healing Place Lyrics"That has to be the age of overcoming
The systems which are, which are on the
Which are on this side and
Which are on the run to destroy
Humankind's nation
Humankind's inwardness
Humankind's ability
What for me is a true capital
And which as a side effect
Last not least destroys nature and us"Embed
