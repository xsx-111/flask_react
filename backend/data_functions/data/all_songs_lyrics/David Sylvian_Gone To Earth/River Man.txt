River Man LyricsI see your eyes light up like fire
It's medicine to me
But as the hunted live their lives
You're keeping out of reach
So i keep running, falling
Till i reach the water
Run with me holyman
But when i reach out
I find i'm standing right beside her
Now we're living
Blessed with all the thunder in the world
Now, should you ask me to come home
To wake up from the sleep
Like a boat inside a storm
Is there no hope for me?
So i keep running, falling
Wade into the water
Run with me riverman
But when i reach out
I find i'm standing right beside her
Now we're living
Blessed with all the thunder in the worldEmbed
