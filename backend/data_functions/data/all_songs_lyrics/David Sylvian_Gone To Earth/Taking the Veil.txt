Taking the Veil LyricsIn dresses white, all set for sail
A little girl dreams of taking the veil
In dresses white, all set for sail
A little girl dreams of taking the veil
On beaches clean of sand and shell
A little girl dreams of taking the veil
All lightning bright and thunder loud
A little girl dreams safe and soundEmbed
