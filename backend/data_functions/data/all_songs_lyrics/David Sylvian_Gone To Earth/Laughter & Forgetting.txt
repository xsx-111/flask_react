Laughter & Forgetting LyricsRunning like a horse between the trees
The ground beneath my feet
Gives me something to hold on to
With the reins around my heart
Guided by hands that spread life before my very eyes
Well every hope falls down on its knees in time
But I'm no longer lost
Every day, every second, every hour inside
Love's my only guide
Are these the years of laughter and forgetting?Embed
