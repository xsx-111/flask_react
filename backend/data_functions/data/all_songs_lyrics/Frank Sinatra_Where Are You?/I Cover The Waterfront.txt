I Cover The Waterfront LyricsI cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love be coming back to me?
I cover the waterfront
In search of my love
And I'm covered by a starless sky above
Here am I patiently waiting, hoping and longing
Oh, how I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
And will you return?
I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
For the one I love must soon come back to meEmbed
