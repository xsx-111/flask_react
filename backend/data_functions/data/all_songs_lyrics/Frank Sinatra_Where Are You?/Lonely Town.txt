Lonely Town LyricsNew York, New York
Or a village in Iowa
The only difference is the name
If you're alone
Whether on Main Street
Or on Broadway
If you're alone
They are both the same
A town's a lonely town
When you pass through
And there is no one waiting there for you
Then it's a lonely town
You wander up and down
The crowds rush by
A million faces pass before your eyes
Still it's a lonely town
Unless there's love
A love that's shining
Like a harbor light
You're lost in the night
Unless there's love
The world's an empty place
And every town's
A lonely townEmbed
