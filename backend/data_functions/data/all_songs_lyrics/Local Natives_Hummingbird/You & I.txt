You & I Lyrics
You and I, we were always strong
It was enough to keep me on
Believe me
And I woke up with my green eyes blue
And all I think about is you
And your fist

Where did your love, where did your love grow cold?
The closer I get, the farther I have to go
To places we don't know
To places we don't know
To places we don't know
To places we don't know

In all this light, all I feel is dark
Had the sun without its' warmth
I'm freezing

Where did your love, where did your love grow cold?
The closer I get, the farther I have to go
To places we don't know
To places we don't know
To places we don't know
To places we don't know14Embed
