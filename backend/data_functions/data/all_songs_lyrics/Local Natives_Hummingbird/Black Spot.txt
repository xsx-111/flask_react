Black Spot Lyrics
Oh, no, I'm dying wrong
I can read it in the whites
And the thing is, I knew it before
I re-open my eyes
And if I didn't know to be afraid
The faces made me sure that I do now
As I sit and wait, as I sit and wait

Oh, no, I'm dying wrong
But I'm still laying here alive
With a black spot on my arm
And so calm, I look inside
And I see the things I always knew
But wasn't sure until now
That if it comes to claim, that if it comes to claim

I won't run
I won't run
I won't run
I won't run1Embed
