Heavy Feet LyricsPowder in your hair
Staples in your jeans
Fireworks at the water
You were holy
A styrofoam cup
Held between your teeth
Telling me how you're going to outlive your body
What you said I wrote it down, I won't say, I won't speak - the same
Maybe I know better than to read more than what's written
After everything, after everything
Left in the sun, shivering
After everything
Gathering your storm
Talk to fill the space
Do you know where so and so was when they were our age
Then every night you seem to talk me out of everything
Careful what you say next, donâ€™t waste a single drop
What you said I wrote it down, won't say, won't speak - the same
After everything, after everything
Left in the sun, shivering
After everything
What you said I wrote it down, but won't say, won't speak - the same
Maybe I know better than to read more than what's there
After everything, after everything
Left in the sun, shivering
After everything5Embed
