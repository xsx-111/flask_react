Black Balloons LyricsI can see the words as they come out your mouth
Black balloons form into a poison cloud
Hold me down and bring me back up again
Until I can't, I can't tell the difference
Circling vultures always overhead
Force your hand
Every day is life or death
Hold me down and bring me back up again
Until I can't, I can't tell the difference
Now you've changed your name
Do they still ask you twice?
I look on
Red lights flashing for applause
Play your part
Swear you're who you say you are
You hold me down and bring me back up again
Until I can't, I can't tell the difference3Embed
