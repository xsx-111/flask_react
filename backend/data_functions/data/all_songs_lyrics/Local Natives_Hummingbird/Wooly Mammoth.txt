Wooly Mammoth Lyrics
In the summer, vicious summer
This is nothing like I thought it would look

They say, "Who am I to blame?"
"Who am I to blame?"

Spill yourself at her feet
Stamp me out, flickering

Can you remind me which are the ones that sting?
They all look the same to me
Look the same to me

Spill yourself at her feet
Stamp me out, flickering
There's a sun rising
Steady now, comfort me

This will swallow, swallow me alive
They say, "Who am I to blame?"
"Who am I to blame?"

Spill yourself at her feet
Stamp me out, flickering
There's a sun rising
Steady now, comfort meEmbed
