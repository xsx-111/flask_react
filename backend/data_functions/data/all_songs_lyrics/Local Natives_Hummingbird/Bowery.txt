Bowery Lyrics
We were standing
At Forsyth and Bowery
Flowers and painted forehead
Trying to forget

(Oh) Can't tell if the ceiling's rising
(Oh) Or if the floor's falling out

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

I remember some nights without sleep
Godlike and cowering
Taller stacks of stones
Is all we'll have to show

(Oh) Can't tell if the ceiling's rising
(Oh) Or if the floor's falling out

At the time I wasn't with you
By that time I didn't care
At the time I wasn't with you
By that time I didn't care
The fall is so much faster
Than you and I could ever climb
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh3Embed
