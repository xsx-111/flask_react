Colombia Lyrics
The day after I had counted down all of your breaths
Down until there were none, were none, were none, were none
A hummingbird crashed right in front of me and I understood all you did for us
You gave, and gave, and gave, and gave

Oh, every night I ask myself
Am I giving enough?
Am I giving enough?
Am I giving enough?
Am I?

If you never knew how much, if you never felt all of my love
I pray now you do, you do, you do, you do

Oh, every night I ask myself
Am I loving enough?
Am I loving enough?
Am I loving enough?
Am I?

Patricia, every night I'll ask myself
Am I giving enough?
Am I giving enough?
Am I giving enough?
Am I?
Patricia, every night I'll ask myself
Am I loving enough?
Am I loving enough?
Am I loving enough?
Am I?9Embed
