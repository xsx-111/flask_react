Three Months Lyrics
You always hated
Every gorgeous coffee curl
You could never see that
That to him they meant the world

I am letting you know
I am ready to feel you
I am letting you know
I am ready to feel you

I keep on calling
Just to get the machine
I've got to go on now
Having thought this wasn't your last year

I am letting you know
I am ready to feel you
I am letting you know
I am ready to feel you2Embed
