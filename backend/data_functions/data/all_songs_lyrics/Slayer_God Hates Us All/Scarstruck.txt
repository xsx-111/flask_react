Scarstruck LyricsCome step inside my hate, you know there's nothing to it
Step inside my pain, you'll never make it through it
Once you're sucked into my sado-paradise
Lose your mind inside, the pleasure lies within your pain
Pain

Drown in my hate, you know, you know
Brutality's the way of this world
Branded and scarred, defy, defy
A comatose and blind existence
Hatred holocaust, you see in me
It's more than just a way of life
I've reinvented the way
I relate to this complacent world

All of life decays
Rapes my eyes
Screams never silence the pain
Death is like an old friend
I can't wait to watch you die

I am your vice, so real, so real
Desire for the scars of new flesh
Bathe in your blood, excites, incites
The ritualistic lacerations
Inhumanities profane, insane
Inflicted since the dawn of time
Make your peace with God—goodbye
And embrace the pain that burns inside you
All of life decays
Rapes my eyes
Screams never silence the pain
Death is like an old friend
I can't wait to watch you die
I can't wait

Come step inside my hate, you know there's nothing to it
Step inside my pain, you'll never make it through it
Redefine your life in sado-paradise
Necessary cleansing of the mind's eye
Love the agony, electric ecstasy
Can't get enough, euphoric serenity
Stains won't fade away, forever scarstruck
They never fade away, forever scarstruck

Drown in my hate, you know, you know
Brutality's the way of my world
Branded and scarred, defy, defy
A comatose and blind existence
You're like the walking dead, so blind inside
Oblivious to psycho pleasure
I am your new God—un-God
So if you want hell, here I am
Everything around me decays
Rapes my eyes
Screams never silence the pain
Make you my canvas of pure, fresh flesh
