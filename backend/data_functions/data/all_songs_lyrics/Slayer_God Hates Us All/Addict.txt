Addict Lyrics
I won't cover your eyes
I want your innocence
Glisten before me in a cold sweat
I wan't you to see your lie spill on me
Spill on me

Manifested as a primitive craving
The craving never seems to go away
I want to see the face of everyone fall
Fall into the cold embrace of death

You're in my nightmare
I decide when it stops
It's my fucking drug
Makes my rush intensify
Hardcore, the overdose
Your fear gets me high

Unbound, I'm the weapon made to sterilize
Sterilize all the idiot victims
Anytime, anywhere, anyone I want
Everyone's addicted to this torture
I'm the agony in every breath
Every breath brings you closer to me
You'll do anything, anything
You'll do anything to make it stop

You're in my nightmare
I decide when it stops
It's my fucking drug
Makes my rush intensify
Chaos deep inside, it makes me

It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill
It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill

Do you want to feel eternity?
Your eternity lies within me
I am the terror of your final breath
Your final breath brings light to my darkness

Like an act of fucking God unleashed
On the innocence, innocence of mankind
You'll do anything, anything
You'll do anything to make it stop
It's my fucking drug
Makes my rush intensify
Hardcore fucking overdose
Your fear gets me off like fuck

It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill
It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill
It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill
It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill
It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill
It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to killEmbed
