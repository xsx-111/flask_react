We Never Argue LyricsInternational velvet international underground
International coverage international I'd like to cover your butt
We never argue because we're never in the same place
In the redwood forest you're testing my will each day
To the New York island determined to get your way
International I see you international babe of mine
International police international calling card number
We never argue because we're never in the same place
In the redwood forest you're testing my will each day
To the New York island determined to get your way
International rivers international ports of call
International secrets international objects of desire
We never argue because we're never in the same place
In the redwood forest you're testing my will each day
To the New York island determined to get your wayEmbed
