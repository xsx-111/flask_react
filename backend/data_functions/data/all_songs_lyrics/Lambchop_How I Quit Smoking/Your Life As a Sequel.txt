Your Life As a Sequel LyricsShould I know your place
And my place is undiscovered
Through a curtain or refinery
Not certain or temporary
I should be more considerate
Of the others on call
In the day to day opportunity
That is my life
A beautiful case
Of the unspoiled grace
Which can enter your race
Quite unknowing
For certain there are no
Real changes in the original
Outtakes of your life
As a sequel
Unsuccessful too
Dumb again
Wall-eyed and wounded
In the capital city
Under tense evaluation
Does that have anything to do with dissolving
My star has put my life
Under the greatest of scrutiny
A balancing place
Between your nose and your face
A consolidated center
Of learning
Making up offers
Of considerable cost
Which can enter your life
As a sequelEmbed
