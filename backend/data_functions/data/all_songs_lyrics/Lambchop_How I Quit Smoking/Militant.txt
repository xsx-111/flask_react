Militant LyricsHe hails you and you pay him no mind
A painter with nothing left upstairs
Life needn't work out that way
He's directing his misinterpretations
Fresh letters in the hard cement
Anagrammed by one tony d
In any order: the kkk
Inscribed by an idiot
I gouge them out with a screwdriver
Till there's nothing left
But some crumpled concrete
I shiver
They are so very small
The militant
To be blunt or insensitive
Overrated under insulated carefree loving manEmbed
