The Militant  (reprise) LyricsHe hails you and you pay him no mind
A painter with nothing left upstairs
Life needn't work out that way
His directing his misinterpretation
Fresh letters in the hearts of men
An anagram by one Tony D
In any order the KKK
Inscribed by an idiot
I catch them out with a screwdriver
Until there is nothing left
But some crumble concrete, not shiver
They all so very small i shiver
They all so very small i shiver
They all so very small i shiver
The militant
To be blunt
Or insensitive
Overrated, underinsulated
Carefree, loving manEmbed
