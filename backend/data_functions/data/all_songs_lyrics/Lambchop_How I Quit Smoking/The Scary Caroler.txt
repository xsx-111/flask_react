The Scary Caroler LyricsWell I feel more like I do today
Than I did last night
Makin' odds on the silvery moom
Makin' it all seem that nice
And then you lie
(your back your scrotum)
And you close your eyes
(your shoulders your pelvis)
And you sleep alright
(your wrist knuckles and knees)
All these things ache
Well Jesus Christ
I got my dogs on ice
A piece of grit in my eye
I start to spit
Then I start to cry
I'm happy
I just don't know why
And then you rise
(your buttocks your calves)
And you open your eyes
(your sinus your ears)
And you sleep alright
(your arms your cheeks)
All these things ache
Yes I've had better days
I would like a new shot
My teeth they were
Extremely white
Cast off cast off
You scary caroler
This hasn't been my nightEmbed
