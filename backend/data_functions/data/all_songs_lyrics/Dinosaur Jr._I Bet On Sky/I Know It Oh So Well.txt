I Know It Oh So Well Lyrics
I got home again, I watched you float away
I would like to, but can't seem to ever say
If you told me, would I show you what to do
And I could tell
Because I know myself
I know it oh so well

I might come and go
Till I can feel you near
I don't wish this on your friend, but was I clear?
How's it possible to be there for so long and be so feared?

Because I know myself, it's gotten so severe
Is the light ahead?
Is the night ahead?
We need a creed

Is the light ahead?
Is the light ahead?
Enough for two?
Look the other way
Can't find it, but I try
Senses overloaded, pretty sure they're fried
Thought I picked it up, but it's nowhere around
My hands are tied
Because I know myself
I'm pretty sure I'm high

Is the light ahead?
Is the night ahead?
What to do?

Is the light ahead?
Is the light ahead?
Enough for you?

Because I've come this far without it
But I can't go on without it
Tell me one less thing about it
Then I could leave
Every day it's getting harder
It's a life I need started
Try to grab, it's getting farther away from me

I got sick and you got sick of all my pain
I got sick of hoping you would understand
There's a side I hid from people
Kind of people I don't know

I don't know the end
I don't want you to tell
Because I know myself
I know it oh so wellEmbed
