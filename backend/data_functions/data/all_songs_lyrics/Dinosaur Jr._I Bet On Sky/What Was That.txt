What Was That Lyrics
I miss my life
This isn't good
Got so intent
I wish you would

Said I'm down to meet you
What should I bring?
Someone said I should see you
I'll try anything

I open the door
Knew I wanted more
Never seemed so thin like this before

Walk right out
What was that?
Walk right out
Got a gold band

I finally went
I brought my friend
Our minds met
I got a mend
Said I'm down to meet you
I almost said
Someone said I should see you
So glad I did

And I might steal in line
Tricks me all the time
Hug you down the sides

Been aloof
What was that?
I was hurt
I came back

It's been a while
She knows my face
I got so much
I pulled away

Said I'm going to meet you
And even then
Someone said I should see you
I'm all here
Said I'm down to meet you
I'm back again
Someone said I should see you
So now's then1Embed
