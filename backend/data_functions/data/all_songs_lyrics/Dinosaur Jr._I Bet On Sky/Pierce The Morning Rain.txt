Pierce The Morning Rain LyricsTry the morning rain, it tastes the same
But I won't (?)
Pulled one over but I stole her fair and square
You must admit
Pierced the morning rain
My eyes again
She can't go if I don't know I'm goin' in
Had a look around, the sky, the town
And I refused to quit
Causing quite a stir all over her
Our bed, you must admit
Pierce the morning rain
I'm free again
Others wouldn't stay
I stuck to you, my friend
I won't abide
I'll bet on sky to get me through this lifeEmbed
