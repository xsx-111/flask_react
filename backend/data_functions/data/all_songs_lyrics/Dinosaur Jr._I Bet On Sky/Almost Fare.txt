Almost Fare Lyrics
Come with me, Come with me
It's the time now
You won't see, you and me
Gotta find out

Always free, almost free, almost maybe
On your own, all you know, time is fading
Now there she is, what should i do? What should i give?
Stop to breathe, now your almost there get on your knees and

Come with me, come with me, do it over
Go to her, all you learn, eyes will show her
Its the past, walk in last, what do you say?
Almost there, always fare, make your own way

Now there she is, what should i do? what should i give?
It all expands
She's walking out now touch her hand and

Come with me, Come with me, It's the time now
You won't see, you and me, Got to find out
Almost there, always fare, do it over
Go to her, All you learn, eyes will show her1Embed
