Rude Lyrics
I am here to curse my own tongue again
Words wrong again
Untrue
Though I'm the only who may have noticed it
How bloated it seemed to be

Falling from my mouth it wouldn't move
Not helping any point I'm trying to prove
Just lying there, dying in the air
I wish I didn't care
'Cause caring is rude

I am here to curse my own name again
Take the blame again
For you
It's easier to think that if I could change
The world could change, but that's not true

'Cause you are yours and we don't share a soul
And nothing I could say will gain control
Oh nature I should leave her to herself
It's better for my health –
If I don't intrude
'Cause caring is rude

You are yours and we don't share a goal
And nothing I could say will gain control
Oh nature I should leave her to herself
It's better for my health –

If I don't intrude
'Cause caring is rude
Nature is cruelEmbed
