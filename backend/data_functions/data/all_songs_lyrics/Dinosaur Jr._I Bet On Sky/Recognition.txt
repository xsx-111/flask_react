Recognition Lyrics
Look what I've done
Didn't make the best of that one
I arrive feeling sure
But ended up all insecure

How does it feel
To be lost in your creation
Underneath the vow of light
The situation improvised

Here we all fear
There's a sign of recognition
Good to know who can survive
The spinning end of every night


Tonight I'll make it out alive
A validation of surprise
Cause I'm hungry for it now
And I want to hear a sound
Of recognition
Let me in!
Wind me up and watch me spin
