Watch the Corners Lyrics
Every morning came
I don't like that you can hide in
We expect the same
But I've no one to confide in
And I want you to be with us
And in time there's no forgiveness
And the plan was set in stone long ago
There's never not a time not to know

Can I run, but you'll be there
Disappear it's never fair
It's like a stare
When I call to tell you no
Every action going slow
Can I whisper all alone
Can I find it far from home
There's a time to make you move
All at once the time flew



Hey me watch the corners
Watch me because I know what you done
Hey me don't you know
Watch me because I'm all alone2Embed
