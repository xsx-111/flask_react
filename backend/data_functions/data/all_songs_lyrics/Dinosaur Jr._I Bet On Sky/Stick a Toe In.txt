Stick a Toe In LyricsCan I walk alone?
Can I stick a toe in and all will think it's fine
How far should I go?
Will it be enough to feel it slipping through my mind?
It's time I check the plan
Can I meet you, understand?
Take my hand, don't let her cheat you
Of the feeling, you deserve anything
Can I go to bed?
Feeling really tired but after something that you said
Slap me hard instead
Seems like the best way to clear the cobwebs out my head
Time I checked the plan
Can I meet you, understand?
Take my hand, don't let her cheat you
Of the feeling, you deserve anything
And I got lots to tell me, please don't let me
Let's just assume I was wrong
I got so much facing, I will waste it
Now, don't know where I belong
I got lots to tell you, where'd you get to now
Need a friend to be strong
I got over you, kick me when it's the least
Can you help me along with things?
Can I walk alone?
Can I take a sip or is it just too much to know
How much should I show?
Or will it be enough to feel it till it's time to go
Time I check the plan
Can I meet you, understand?
Take my hand, don't let her cheat you
Of the feeling, you deserve anything
Tell me where to go, should I meet you?
I don't know
I can't stand, to make an issue, of a feeling
When we know we shouldn't do
I got lots to tell me, please don't let me
Let's just assume I was wrong
I got so much facing, I will waste it
Now, take me where I belong
I don't know where I went to see you're upset
Can't you sing me a song?
I'm exploding here, kick me and it's at least
Can you have me along?
I'm old, I'm old, I'm old
I'm old, I'm old, I'm oldEmbed
