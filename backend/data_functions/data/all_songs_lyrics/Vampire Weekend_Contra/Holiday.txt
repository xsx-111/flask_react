Holiday Lyrics
Holiday, oh, a holiday
And the best one of the year
Dozing off underneath my sheets
While I cover both my ears

But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

Holiday, still so far away
Our republic on the beach
I can't forget just how bad it gets
When I'm counting on my teeth

But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

A vegetarian since the invasion
She'd never seen the word 'bombs'
She'd never seen the word 'bombs'
Blown up to 96-point Futura
She'd never seen an AK
In a yellowy Day-Glo display
A T-shirt so lovely, it turned all the history books grey
I got wheels, I got Cutter spray
And a healthy sense of worth
Half of me is the gasoline
But the other half's the surf

So if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear3Embed
