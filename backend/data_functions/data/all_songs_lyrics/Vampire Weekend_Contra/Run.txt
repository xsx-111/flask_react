Run Lyrics
Every dollar counts
And every morning hurts
We mostly work to live
Until we live to work

She said
"You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But chang-
-ing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run

Worlds away from cars
And all the Stars and Bars
Where a little bit of condensation means so much
And a little bit of change is all your little fingers touch

I said
"You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But chang-
-ing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run
'Cause, honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two-ooh-ooh-ooh
But I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
And a little bata radio
We could try

So lead my feet away
'Cause all they do is stay
And I don't think your eyes
Have ever looked surprised

She said
"You know
There's nowhere left to go"
But with
Her fund
It struck me that the two of us could run

'Cause, honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two-ooh-ooh-ooh
If I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
And a battered radio
We could try, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh4Embed
