Living in Danger LyricsLive for yourself, it's a wonderful thing
You can do what you want, you can live in a dream
Get up, get in
Get the rhythm, get down
You're living your life in peace and in harmony
You making your own desisions
That's how it's got to be for you and me
So many people are running around and 'round
Without no sense of logic
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
People are the same today as they used to be
The same expectations
So high no-one can reach that high
Nor I, nor you get satisfied today
We'll never get enough
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
People are the same today as they used to be
We'll never get enough
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
Oh, so much danger (In the eyes of a stranger)
Oh, I look into the eyes of a stranger, ohoho!
Oh, yeah
(I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho)
In the eyes of a strangerEmbed
