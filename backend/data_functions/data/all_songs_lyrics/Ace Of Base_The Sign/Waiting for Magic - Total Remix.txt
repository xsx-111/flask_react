Waiting for Magic - Total Remix LyricsA man of the world but lost in a dream
You look at something from a different angle
But I exist, I'm waiting for you
In a coffin made of glass
Kiss me baby I'm attractive
Baby get to know me, show who you are
Give me that music, baby I'm eternal
Lying in a coffin waiting for you
In your dream a girl is dancing close to you
That girl is me
Once a witch made her sleep
But a prince will wake her up, it's you
Kiss me baby I'm attractive
Baby get to know me, show who you are
Give me that music, baby I'm eternal
Lying in a coffin waiting for you
Kiss me baby I am snow white
Sleeping in a coffin waiting for you
Waiting for magic, baby I am snow white
Sleeping in a coffin waiting for you
It's what I do
For me and you
Oh, kiss me baby, wake me up
Ohh, kiss me baby wake me up
Come on baby
Kiss me baby I am snow white
Sleeping in a coffin waiting for you
Waiting for magic, baby I am snow white
Sleeping in a coffin waiting for youEmbed
