Wheel of Fortune LyricsWhat you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad
If this wheel lets you down
My love is my engine
And you might be fuel
Stop acting cool
Just bet you might win
I'm not too cool
We're gonna make your move
Don't push me
I don't want to, can't you see it
Hasten slowly
And don't count your chicks
Before they're hatched baby
What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad
If this wheel lets you down
My love is my engine
And you might be fuel
Stop acting cool
Just bet you might win
I'm not too cool
Hey you
We're gonna make your move
It tastes like steel
Like a stab from a knife
Ooh what you gonna tell your daddy
Ooh whoa whoa
What you gonna tell your daddy
Ooh whup
Say what you gonna tell your daddy
Mmm oh what you gonna tell your daddy
Ooh what you gonna tell your daddy
I'm in love with another fool
I'm in love with you, I like your style
I want you, I'm in love
I'm in love with you, I like your style
I want you, I'm in love
What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad
If it lets you down yeah
What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad
If this wheel lets you down
My love is my engine
And you might be fuel
Stop acting cool
Just bet you might win
I'm not too cool
I'm in love with another fool
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm in love with another fooooool
Tell tell tell ya, bad
Ooh I'm in love with you, I like your style
I want you I'm in loveEmbed
