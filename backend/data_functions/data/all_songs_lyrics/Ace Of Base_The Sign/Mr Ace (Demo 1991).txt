Mr Ace (Demo 1991) Lyrics
A lonely life
She lives a lonely life
A lonely life
She lives a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
Oh, what a morning!
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just lying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby

I'm a love machine
I'm Mr. Ace, I'm running my Base
When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
Oh, what a morning!
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just lying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, eeh eh

I'm a love machine
I'm Mr. Ace, I'm running my Base

Oh oh oh, all that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, eeh eh
All that she wants
Oh oh oh, all that she wants
All that she wants is another baby, eeh ehEmbed
