Dancer in a Daydream LyricsWhat an odd situation
What an odd situation
What an odd situation
What you got is basic emotions can you feel them?
I want to be your lover but you're so shy
What you need is perfect assistance let me guide you
To a land you've never seen before
I guess you see, I have another daydream
I guess you see, that I have another daydream
Come and be a dancer
Dance into my daydream
Join me in my daydream wet and wild
Come and be a dancer
Dance into my daydream
Join me in the jungle wet and wild
To help another person will make you feel important
You got my invitation but you're so shy
Come and let your wild side show and be a dancer
A dancer in a daydream we can share
I guess you see, I have another daydream
I guess you see, that I have another daydream
Oooh who will take the dream?
I guess you see that I have another daydream
I guess you see that I have another daydream
Help me take control of my fool imagination
I'm looking for a man that will match my situation
I'm thinking about the people waiting down the line
I am in the limelight now's my time
I guess you see that I have another daydream
(I know we’ll share it another day)
I guess you see that I have another daydream
(and I know we’ll dance)
What you gonna do I'm a bold explosionEmbed
