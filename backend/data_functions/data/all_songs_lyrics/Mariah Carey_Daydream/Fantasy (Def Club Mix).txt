Fantasy (Def Club Mix) Lyrics
Ooh
On and on and on
So sweet, yeah
Oh, oh
On and on and on, on and on and on
Sweet, sweet
Sweet, oh-oh, yes
You come and take me
So deep
Sweet, fantasy

Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
When I close my eyes, you come and you take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Sweet fantasy)
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby

Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
(But it's just a sweet), sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and you take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams (So deep, so deep)
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Sweet fantasy)
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams (Fantasy)
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (So sweet, fantasy)

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, oh, oh

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

(But it's just a) Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and you take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams (So deep)
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Sweet fantasy)
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and you take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (So sweet, fantasy)
Fantasy
Fantasy
Fantasy (Fantasy)
Fantasy (Fantasy)

It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet, sweet

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, it's just a, it's just a, oh-oh
Oh-oh, yeah
Sweet sweet sweet sweet
Sweet sweet sweet sweet
Sweet sweet, fantasy
My sweet, sweet
My sweet
It's just a, it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy
Sweet, sweet fantasy
It's just a sweet, sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, sweet, it's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, sweet
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, sweet
It's just a sweet
Oh-oh, hey, oh-oh-oh, hey, oh
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, sweet
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, sweet
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet, sweet
Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, fantasy
Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, fantasy
Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, fantasy
It's so sweet
And every night, you creep into my dreams
Fantasy
It's so deep, but it's a fantasy, oh
Every night, you creep into my dreams
It's so real
In my daydreams
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet
It's seems so real

You touch me
You come into room
Come to me

It feel so sweet
It's seems so real
It's just a sweet fantasy1Embed
