Five Miles Out LyricsWhat do you do when you're falling
You've got 30 degrees and you're stalling out?
And it's 24 miles to your beacon
There's a crack in the sky and the warning's out
Don't take that dive again!
Push through that band of rain!
Five miles out
Just hold your heading true
Got to get your finest out
You're Number 1, anticipating you
Climbing out
Just hold your heading true
Got to get your finest out
You're Number 1, anticipating you
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
Calling all stations!
This is Golf-Mike-Oscar-Victor-Juliet
IMC CU. NIMB... icing
In great difficulty, over
The traffic controller is calling
"Victor-Juliet" - it's your identity
I have you lost in the violent storm!
Communicate on Squawk Emergency!"
Don't take that dive again!
Push through that band of rain!
Lost in Static, 18
And the storm is closing in now
Automatic, 18!
(Got to push through!)
Trapped in living hell!
You're a prisoner of the dark sky
The propeller blades are still!
And the evil eye of the hurricane's
Coming in now for the kill
Our hope's with you
Rider in the blue
Welcome's waiting, we're anticipating
You'll be celebrating, when you're down and braking
Climbing out
(Climbing, climbing)
Five miles out
(Climbing, climbing)
Five miles out
Just hold your heading true
Got to get your finest out...
(Climbing, climbing)
Five miles out
Just hold your heading true
Got to get your finest out...
(Climbing, climbing)
Climbing out
Just hold your heading true
Got to get your finest out...
(Climbing, climbing)
Five miles out
Just hold your heading true
Got to get your finest out...
(Climbing, climbing)
Climbing out
Just hold your heading true
Got to get your finest out...
(Climbing, climbing)
Climbing out
Just hold your heading true
Got to get your finest out...Embed
