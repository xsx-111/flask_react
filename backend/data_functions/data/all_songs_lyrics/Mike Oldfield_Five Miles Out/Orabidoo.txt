Orabidoo LyricsWatch the skys dawning on you
Soaring over country land
Message comes from Kathmandu:
Sky is blue and clear
Program your outing
Gaze at clouds in this window pane
Where is your wish going?
The wind to control you at night
O
Orabibi
Orabibiba
Orabibi
Orabibaba
Orabibibabi
Lazing in the sun, we glide
Soon you come from watch
Touched, you save me just in time
Storm is out to catch
Program your chartering
Gaze at clouds in this window pane
Stay patched through onto me
Crawling into trouble, that's plain!
O
Orabibi
Orabibiba
Orabibi
Orabibaba
Orabibibabi
Watch out! Storms in Kathmandu
Calling from country land
Message comes from Kathmandu:
Sky is blue and clear
Program your outing
Watching now your system for rains
Clouds: forty storeys!
(Don't come in again like that, it isn't funny
And I pay someone else to make the orchestration!)
Oh, island of the soul
Valleys hushed and white with snow
Ireland's eye...
You'll linger with me 'til the day I die
Oh, how it hurts to go
The waters ebb and flow
The changing seasons come and go
Ireland's eye...
Forever reaching up into the sky
Oh, how I'll miss you so
The sunlight dancing on your rocky shores
The moonlight playing upon the water
Your memory will stay with me forever more
Wherever I may roam
Stay with my dreams, I will see you!
Safe in my heart I will keep youEmbed
