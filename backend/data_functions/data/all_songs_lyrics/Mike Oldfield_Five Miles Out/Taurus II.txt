Taurus II LyricsHush now baby made a start
There's a jewel in your heart
And a star that shines for you
Watching everything you do
Don't you cry though it may seem
You were born into a dream
There's another race to run
You were not the only one
Standing in the morning sun
Waiting though it had begun
May you never run aground
Or call into the deep deep sound
Stormy weather turns to blue
Here's a song to take with youEmbed
