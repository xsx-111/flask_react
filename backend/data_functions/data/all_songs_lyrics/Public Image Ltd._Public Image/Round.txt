Round LyricsRound and around
Around, around, round, round
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Well, of course
We've always had it in us
For a million years
Sleeping hali'osis
Deaf ears provide
Perfect pure protection
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Mushrooms on the horizon
Mushrooms on the horizon
You seem to say to say
Nothing can be something
Ignorance now
Dominates the season
Cruel fool
Idiot and spastic
Dutch courage
Talking like an ashtray
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Mushrooms on the horizon
Mushrooms on the horizon

How many of you have seen a factory?
As the boss held high
And the children die
Don't lecture here
Don't spit on my life
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Mushrooms on the horizon
Mushrooms on the horizon
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
Round and around
Around, around, round, round
