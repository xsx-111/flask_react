Still in Love LyricsToday I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Someone else stood by your side
She looked so satisfied
I can't help it, I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealin'
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old-time feelin'
I can't help it, I am still in love with you
It hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it, I'm still in love with youEmbed
