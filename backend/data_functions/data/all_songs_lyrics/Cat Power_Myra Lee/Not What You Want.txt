Not What You Want LyricsI am not what you want
There's no telling how long
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long
I've checked
I've checked to find
I've checked
I've checked to find
I am not for you one
There's no telling how long
Go figure that out
Figure that out
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I've checked
I've checked to find
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I am not what you want
There's no eyes in your own head
I'll check
I'll check tonight
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I am not what you want
There's no eyes in your head
In your head
At least I cannot see them
In your head
I'm not what you want
I'll get
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Tonight
I'm not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
Be here
At least I cannot see themEmbed
