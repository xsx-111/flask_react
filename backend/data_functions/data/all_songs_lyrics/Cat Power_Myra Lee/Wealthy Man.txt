Wealthy Man LyricsOh I see sunny days
Oh I go that far
When the night is over
Will you tell me that you've always been thinking of me?
Indirectly you say to me the hand of a night is not a hand for me
That's the most sad I've ever heard from another man
A wealthy man
That's the most sad I've ever heard from another man
A wealthy man
A wealthy man
Oh I still see sunny days
Oh I go that far
When the night is dragging on
Maybe I will dream that you would tell me
You've always been thinking of me
Indirectly you say to me
The hand is not a hand for me
Indirectly you say again
The hand of the night is not a hand for me
That's the most sad I've ever heard from another man
A wealthy man
That's the most sad I've ever heard from another man
A wealthy manEmbed
