Top Expert LyricsIn the light that I feel
I see crucifixes and dyslexics
And I feel so safe
Foot by foot
I feel like I'm being cast off
I feel so ashamed
Top expert on the supernatural
Tells us, how you do
Catch a ghost in a jar
10 years richer with my magnet shield
I feel crucified
Backwards, not too close
And I still feel so safe
Be orderly
But feel like I'm passing
I'm winning, I'm winning
And I still feel so ashamed
Top expert on the supernatural
Tells us how to
Make it in the shade
He made it in the shade
I hope you don't hate it
In the shade
Like a ghost in a jarEmbed
