Ice Water LyricsLike I heard her backwards saying
"I can take one thousand showers
And never be clean"
Of course she lied awake
She is ten times heavier
Stronger, than you found the grave
Or ever was
He's got it down now
You know what I need
Who doesn't lie?
You know what I mean
If I'm ever in doubt you
Like you don't know
I am so, angry
I am so, at ease
I feel just like
Some great big disease
I think you need
Ice water
But the only thing that
You really hate
Is all its emptiness
I will swim
And I will drink myself to
Death
If I'm never in
Doubt of you
Like you don't know1Embed
