Rockets LyricsWhere do the dreams of babies go
Cause you know they're all so good
And they're also gone so fast
Keep all the guns at home
Help keep your momma safe
Cause you know she pretty good too
Where is the night so warm and so strange
That no one is afraid
Of themselves
Here, pick up, dig, dig out those weeds
Out of your happy go lucky fields
Of such predictive thinking
Where do the rockets find planets
Where do the rockets find planets
Where do the rockets find planets
Where are the dreams of the babies going
Cause you know they're all gone fast
Take, take as much as you can
Cause you know it's going so fast
And you know it's so good
Where are the man that mounted so brave
That they do not explode over everyone
Here, pick up, dig, dig out those weeds
Out of your happy go lucky fields
Of such predictive thinking
Where do the rockets find planets
Where do the rockets find planets
Keep your guns at home
Keep your guns at home
Help keep your momma safe
You know she's all good too
She's pretty good
Where are all the dreams of babies going
Did you know they're all goodEmbed
