Enough LyricsMy intuition said it was
My intuition said it was fair
All you should know there's
Not enough to go around
Here they go again
I can see 'em
As they try they try to take it out on me
Here they go again I can
Watch closer now
I can watch closer now
They can't find enough
To take enough from me
They can't find enough
To take enough from me
Guess I go down
Said it wasn't but I guess it was
Say it wasn't but I guess it ends
Here they go again
I can, try, try
My Intuition knocked again fair
All you should know by now is there's
Not enough to go around
But I never go that way
The other half of me said I should
Throw it down the drain
Throw it down the drain
They can't find enough
To take enough from me
They can't find enough
To take enough from me
I've seen the hordes of war
Looking down that drain
At your heart
Here they go and they tryEmbed
