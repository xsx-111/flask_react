Great Expectations LyricsI am like powder, I am like relaxation
I am the snow, I am the snow, I am the snow
I live in the desert and I let the wind make love to me
I dig in this ocean and I try to fill it with gold
Fill it to the top, fill it to the top, fill it to the top
Do you look for hope in other people's eyes?
Well, that may be your worst redemption
Do you feed and clothe yourself?
Well, that may be your best defense
I am from the moon, I am from the moon, I am from the moon
So they say, so they say, so they say
Facing, confronting, branding each other
We were made through one another
Great expectations, great expectations, great expectations
So they say, so they say, so they say
I am the snow, I am the snow, I am the snowEmbed
