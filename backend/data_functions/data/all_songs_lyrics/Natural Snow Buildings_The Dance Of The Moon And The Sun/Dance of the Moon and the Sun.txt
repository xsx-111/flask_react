Dance of the Moon and the Sun LyricsThe hawker on my roof is ringing his bell
He's rattling his hooves to raise the dead
The moon and the sun will dance together
And deploy their arms to grab the earth
The devil and his bride, they call me by name
They will blow their horn to open the land
The devil and his bride, they call me by name
They will blow their horn to open the landEmbed
