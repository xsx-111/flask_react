Away, My Ghosts LyricsThat's not me who will take you outside of here
You know, I was just staring at my shoes when the car bumped me
Now I'm just carrying away my ghosts and you've got my back
'Cause I must get them to home before it was dark
There was still some blood on my shirt when I find you here
Speaking along between two walls
But I picked nothing
Now I'm just carrying away my ghosts and you've got my back
'Cause I must get them to home before it was darkEmbed
