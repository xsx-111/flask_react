Lie There LyricsShe took all the pictures of her past, threw them into the sea
"Lied there my sad souvenir until my guide lord returned to me"
Then she sat down into her room then cried, cried, then fell asleep
"In my dreams I could not join him where he is, he must have forgot me"
I don't need no angel to call my love, I just need to go down the sea
I don't need no angel to call my love, I just need to go down the sea1Embed
