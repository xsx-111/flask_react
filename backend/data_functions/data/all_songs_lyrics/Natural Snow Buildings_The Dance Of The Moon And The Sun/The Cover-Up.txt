The Cover-Up LyricsHell, down it came
And knocked at your door
Three men in black
With sunglasses and rifles
But you were still in bed
When they shot the first bullet
Through the windows
Covered with curtains
But as fast as possible
You emerged from your dreams
Of violence, shot each guy between the eyes
Fear them
There's nowhere you can hide
Fear them
There's nowhere you can hideEmbed
