Interstate Roads LyricsInterstate roads
Dismember you like the sun
On your way home
But there is no home
There's nothing left
In that house that once was mine
In that house that once was yours
In that house that once was ours
Before the twilight fell
And the rest of the day you've left
And I wish you'll never come back
Yes, I wish you'll never come backEmbed
