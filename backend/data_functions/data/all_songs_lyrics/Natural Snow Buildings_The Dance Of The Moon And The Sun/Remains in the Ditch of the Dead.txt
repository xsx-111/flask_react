Remains in the Ditch of the Dead LyricsEvery time you fall asleep
She's lifting your hand
And stealing your soul
Piece by piece
She's stealing your soul
Piece by piece
She's stealing your soul
Piece by piece
She's stealing your soul
Piece by piece
She's stealing your soul
Piece by piece
She's stealing your soul
Piece by pieceEmbed
