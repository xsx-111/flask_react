She Still Loves Him Lyrics
He writes her a letter
Tells her he won't be home soon (she still loves him)
He lost his temper
Belted his love cross the room (she still loves him)

Drinks when he's sad
Gets happy then mad at the world (she still loves him)
Never remembers that day in September when wed (she still loves him)

So she recalls the days when they were younger
Flowers could heal her wounds
But now those days are gone forever
Now her pain just fills every room

Faces aglow
As the light from the t.v. show
Just separates them now (she still loves him)
All they wanted to be was as happy as couple no. 3 on their favorite game show  (she still loves him)

He recalls the days when they were younger
The future could heal their wounds
But now those days are long since gone forever
Now her pain just fills every room
I know someday this will all work out
She'll never face this alone
The light in her eye may be flickering dim
But she still loves him

She recalls the days when they were younger
The future could heal their wounds
But now those days are long since gone forever
Now her pain just fills every roomEmbed
