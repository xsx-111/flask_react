All I Want is Everything Lyrics
Ever since I was a twinkle in my father's pants
They told me I could have it all and more when given chance
"We'll get you anything that you want"
A Ferrari on my 16th birthday
"We'll get you anything you need"
But what I need from you is so much more!

All I wanna be is wanted
All I wanna be is wanted by you
All I wanna be is wanted
All I want is everything

I think I'd like to play guitar and be a Beatle and be so swell
And every show I would just dedicate this song to you
As I would envy all my fans
While I bitch about the price of fame
To my French maid Lou Ann
She looks attentive but she don't understand

All I wanna be is wanted
All I wanna be is wanted by you
All I wanna be is wanted
All I want is everything
All I wanna be is wanted

All I want is everything
All I wanna be is wanted by you
All I wanna be is wanted
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want is everything

All I want is everything
All I want is everything1Embed
