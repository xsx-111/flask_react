The Man I Used to Be Lyrics
I hope you remember me, I was your daddy once
Wearing the sailor cap, dirty nails
To you I'm just a picture on your mother's mantelpiece
Who chose to fight the good fight in time to fail

Into battle
And in your shadow your daddy loves you still
Yes I do

I never thought it'd be so hard to see you grow so fast
And turn into the man I used to be
But I hope you have more sense than I in matters such as these
Medals don't mean shit when a family is lost at sea, yeah

Into battle
And in your shadow your daddy loves you still
Yes he does, yes he does

Into battle
And in your shadow your daddy loves you still
Yes he does, yeah, yes he does
I save every moment I've reached out and almost touched you
But they all fade away, must be a bad memory


Into battle
And in your shadow your daddy loves you still
Yes he does, yes he does

Into battle
And in your shadow your daddy loves you still
Yes he does, yeah, yes he does
Yes he doesEmbed
