Calling Sarah Lyrics
I know it sounds unfair
She's like a painting standing there
I thank the heavens up above
For the one I'm thinking of

Calling Sarah
Crawling back to Sarah
Cause you're the one

Sometimes it's awful hard to take
The way she takes me all the way
She's delicious beyond compare
I'd love to tell her but instead I stare

Calling Sarah
Crawling back to Sarah
Cause you're the one
Calling Sarah
Crawling back to Sarah
Cause you're the one
And when you ask me if I really love you
I can't wait to tell you
And if you ever feel you don't believe me
And don't you trust your feeling
Cause it'd be so hard to take when you're away
I wouldn't last one day


(That's why I'm) calling Sarah
Crawling back to Sarah (Sarah)
Calling Sarah (that's why I'm calling)
Crawling next to Sarah
Calling Sarah  (and when you asked me if I really missed you)
(I can't wait to tell you)
Crawling back to -
Cause you're the oneEmbed
