Bedspring Kiss LyricsJimmy
His secret's out
The one he locked inside and denied every word about
He's guilty so his story claims
Twisting in his seat he repeats alone his name
Counting the words
Between his every line
Searchin' miles and miles to define
Just what it all means
Jimmy
As quiet as a church mouse
Painted every graphic scene but with few details
His accomplice had made sure of this
When she sealed it with a bedspring kiss
And when her time had come to go
Jimmy washed all of the bloodstains from her clothes
But with a needle in his vein
He knew he could not explain
Just what it all means
Counting the words between his every line
Searchin' miles and miles to define
Just what it all means
Killing his time
A monkey in his vein
He knew he could not explain
Just what it all means
Just what it all meansEmbed
