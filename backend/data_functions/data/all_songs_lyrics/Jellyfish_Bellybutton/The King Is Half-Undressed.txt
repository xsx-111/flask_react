The King Is Half-Undressed Lyrics
So this is where she stands at night
On this cold avenue of lights
The reds and greens but mostly reds
For you he's stopping

In seeing him she knows him less
His stick is wet she's half undressed
And all in all they're both obsessed
With so much nothing

I know it's hard for you to see
What lies behind's a mystery
If words could speak they'd mean even less
When the king is half undressed

She dots her eyes with a smiley face
A work of art in all but taste
The fool deserves the bed he's made
Where idiots slumber

Divine she is to aire his fate
A crack of smile
Through all this hate
Means nothing more in this nervous state
Of so much nothing
I know it's hard for you to see
The truth behind is misery
If words could speak they'd mean even less
When the king is half undressed

Blue Autumns
Sunshine Kisses
Hearts and Flowers
Broken Wishes

I know it's hard for you to see
The truth behind is misery
If words could speak they'd mean even less
When the king is half undressed

I know it's hard for you to see
The truth behind is misery
If words could speak they'd mean even less
When the king is half undressedEmbed
