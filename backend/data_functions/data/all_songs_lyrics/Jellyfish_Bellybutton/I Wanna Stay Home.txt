I Wanna Stay Home Lyrics
When you need someone
And there's no one there
There is always the nine o'clock train
To take you out somewhere

I take the train in town
Like I did for years
There is only seven more blocks
I could walk from here

I wanna stay home
I wanna stay home right here
I wanna stay home today
I wanna stay

It's only six o'clock
When my day begins
There is always my alarm clock
To wake me up again

I wanna stay home
I wanna stay home right here
I wanna stay home today
I wanna stay
When I realize the weight
That's firmly on my shoulders
I just try and find the place
I can take a walk on my blind side

When these memories fade
In my ripe old age
Please remember my dear...

I wanna stay home
I wanna stay home right here
I wanna stay home today
I wanna stay

I wanna stay
I wanna stay
I wanna stay
I wanna stayEmbed
