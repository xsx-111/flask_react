Full Disclosure LyricsI want out, I want out, I want out, I want out
I want out, I want out, I want out, I want out
I want out, I want out, I want out, I want out
I want out, I want out, I want out, I want out
I want out, I want out, I want out, I want out
I want out, I want out, I want out, I want out
I want out, I want out, I want out, I want out
Want a mutually assured destructive life-seizing separate culture
To take me over, moving silent like radar
Take me over and blow out my mind now

Take me over and blow out my mind now

I want out, I want out, I want out, I want out
I want out, I want out, I want out, I want out
I want out, I want out, I want out, I want out
Want a mutually assured destructive life-seizing separate culture
To take me over, moving silent like radar
Take me over and blow out my mind now
Full disclosure coming sponsored by no one
Take me over and blow out my mind now
Blow out my mind now
Blow out my mind now
Full disclosure
Full disclosure
