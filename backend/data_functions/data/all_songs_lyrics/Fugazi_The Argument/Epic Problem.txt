Epic Problem Lyrics
Congratulations - stop
Wish I could be there - stop
Tell me something that I don't know
Is there anything left to know?
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop

Accessory, accessory, accessory
Accessory, accessory, accessory

We regret to inform - stop
Miss you dearly, signed sincerely - stop
Tell me something that I don't know
Is there anything left to know?
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop

Accessory, accessory, accessory
Accessory, accessory, accessory
To the time, time, time, time, time

I've got this epic problem
This epic problem's not a problem for me
And inside, I know I'm broken
But I'm working as far as you can see
I've got this epic problem
This epic problem's not a problem for me
And inside, I know I'm broken
But I'm working as far as you can see
And outside, it's all production
It's all illusion, set scenery
I've got this epic problem
This epic problem's not a problem for meEmbed
