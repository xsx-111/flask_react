Oh Lyrics
Number one in acquisitions
There is no foreign soil
Go global like a round thing
Go global like a hole
Every money matchmaker
Splicing green as fast as you can
Let's break it down and start again

Memo to the partners
I'm changing all the locks
I'm pissing on your modems
I'm shredding all the stocks
Choose a color for your ceiling
I'm waiting for the bottom to drop
In a room so brightly lit
I can't see in, no, no, no

You would never say you were out of time
Your secret is out
Coming with the fiction all the time
Your secret is out
But there's a call coming on the other line
Your secret is out
It's out now, oh yeah
La-la lapse of luxury
La-la-lapping waste
Cruising towards a bruising crash
Thread held anvil's gonna break
When the letter returns to the sender
I can't hardly wait
God, this room's so brightly lit
I can't see shit, no, no, no

You would never say you were out of time
Your secret is out
Coming with the fiction all the time
Your secret is out
But there's a call coming on the other line
Your secret is out
It's out now, it's out yeah

Thank you, may I have another?
I would be your eager driver
Your service provider, your maitre d'
Thank you, may I have another?
I would be your eager driver
Your service provider, your maitre d'
Like a wind up, shaking, shaking partner
Thank you, sir, may I have another?
Thank you, sir, may I have another?
Thank you, sir, may I have another?
