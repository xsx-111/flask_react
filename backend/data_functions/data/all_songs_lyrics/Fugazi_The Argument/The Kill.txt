The Kill LyricsBorn into race and nation
Accept family and obligation
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
Embrace tradition and occupation
Cull memory for assimilation
Secure for future generations
Secure for future generations
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
Laying in this cold field
Waiting for the call
Feeling right here in this uniform
I think I got them all
Academic or street education
Obtain degree in annihilation
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
Laying down in chambers
Waiting for the call
Seen your kind so many times
You got no chance at all
Laid out immobile
Hoping for that call
It's in my mouth, under my skin
Sodium pentathol
Sodium pentathol
Sodium pentathol
Sodium pentatholEmbed
