Nightshop LyricsFuck your fucked directives
God I want a new invective
Custom built to form
Form fit you
Say it to your face
If I get to choose
I'll take something real
The fight to feel
While your next meal is calling
Loosely trademarked as the best
Fucking thing you've ever had
Inside your mouth
All comet cleaned and scrubbed down
Landscaping for a ghost town
While that deficient platform for your head
Causing you to mistake yourself for dead
All that you would issue
Is capital's incontinence
Is it causing you embarrassment?
The wet spot on the carpet that you leave
As the reminder that you need
Of all that it did to you
Adjusting your reception
A welcome self correction
Oh, make it quick, make it soon
Make it something I can do
All by myself
'Cause there's a brain inside it
And there's a brain deciding
And there's a brain inside the brain
There's a brain inside the brain
Deciding
Find something else 
It's time to make or break
Find me somewhere else
Time to make or break
How 'bout it?
I've got no patience
I'm nowhere stationed
I'm hanging at the nightshop eating shit
Said I've got no patience
I'm nowhere stationed
I'm hanging at the nightshop eating shit
"Who works for who?", every asshole says
Side saluting emptiness instead
But if I get to choose I'll take something real
Who works for who, who you working for?
Who works for who, who you working for?Embed
