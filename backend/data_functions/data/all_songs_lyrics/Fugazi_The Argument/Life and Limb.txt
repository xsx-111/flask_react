Life and Limb LyricsWhen the bit pulls tight, the grip is sewn into the reins
Can't breathe it out, you'll just breathe it back again
Come mental-pack, your chambers full for no reason you can name
A boil-in-bag blood supply, you know it's murder on the veins
Oh don't you feel it now?
Viva, viva, viva, life and limb
Viva, viva, viva, threatening
Viva, viva, viva, life and limb
Viva, viva, viva, threatening
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really in a loving way)
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really want it right away)
The national temper, you know it's written on your face
Etched and scratched and mirrored back, don't you know it's all the rage?
Oh, don't you feel it now?
Viva, viva, viva, life and limb, I said
Viva, viva, viva, threatening, said
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really in a loving way)
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really want it right away)
Right away
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really in a loving way)
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really want it right away)
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really in a loving way)
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really want it right away)1Embed
