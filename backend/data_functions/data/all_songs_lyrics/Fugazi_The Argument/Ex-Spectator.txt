Ex-Spectator LyricsLooking out for cars and mortality
Trying to find some sort of geometry
Avoiding mistakes
Keep an eye on every step I take
Everything is building and it appears
That you're all architects and engineers
That's how it looks
That's how it looks from here
I'm an ex-spectator
Can't you see?
I'm an ex-spectator
Never let my
Never let my
Never let my
Never let my vision
Get in the way of...
Here's some questions that the writer sent
Can an observer be a participant?
Have I seen too much?
Does it count if it doesn't touch?
If the view is all I can ascertain
Pure understanding is out of range
If I make that call
Why can't I make that change?
I'm an ex-spectator
Can't you see?
I'm an ex-spectator
Never let my
Never let my
Never let my
Never let my vision
Get in the way of meEmbed
