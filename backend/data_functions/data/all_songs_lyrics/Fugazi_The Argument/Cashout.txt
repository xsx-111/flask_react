Cashout Lyrics
On the morning of the first eviction
They carried out the wishes of the landlord and his son
Furniture's out on the sidewalk next to the family
That little piggie went to market so they're kicking out everyone

Talking about process and dismissal
Forced removal of the people on the corner
Shelter and location
Everybody wants somewhere

The elected are such willing partners
Look who's buying all their tickets to the game
Development wants, development gets, it's official
Development wants this neighborhood gone so the city just wants the same

Talking about process and dismissal
Forced removal of the people on the corner
Shelter and location
Everybody wants somewhere

Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Process and dismissal
Process and dismissal
Shelter and location
Everybody wants somewhere

Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants2Embed
