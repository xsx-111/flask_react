Truth & Bone LyricsSometime i can feel you breathing into me
And these hands i can feel them tugging at my sleeve
I move through the day in the rhythms that i've known
I've got this crazy dream of stripping down to truth and bone
All of it, all of it, all of it stripped down
All of it, all of it, all of it, to truth and bone
My mouth is full of secrets i'm too afraid to tell
My body's full of longing for you to know me well
I move through the day in the rhythms that i've known
I've got this crazy dream of stripping down to thruth and bone
All of it, all of it, all of it stripped down
All of it, all of it, all of it, to truth and bone
I think of sinking in way over my shoulders
Let the water, the water take me in and i
Need you to cut through to where i'm hidden
I'm awkward and i'm too polite and i want
Two stars for arms like orion i could
Breathe in and breathe in and breathe out
If i could only lose myself
I would lose myself in you
I move trough the day in the rhythms that i've known
I've got this crazy dream of stripping down to truth and bone
All of it, all of it, all of it stripped down
All of it, all of it, all of it, to truth and boneEmbed
