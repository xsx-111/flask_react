Maybe an Angel LyricsI put my hands
Where your wings should be
I put my feet
Where the earth should be
And I can't see very far
And when you said that you were dead I hung on
Something I feel
You are an angel, or maybe you could've been
Something out here
You are an angel, or maybe you could've been
I've got this light
Hangs over me
I've got this fear
Cuts into me
And I can't see very far
And when you said that you were dead I hung on
Something I feel
You are an angel, or maybe you could've been
Something out here
You are an angel, or maybe you could've been
See how they run
And nobody said you would go
See how they fall
And I can't see very far
And when you said that you were dead I hung on
Something I feel
You are an angel, or maybe you could've been
Something out here
You are an angel, or maybe you could've been
See how they run
You are an angel
See how they run
All the same, all the same
Something out here
You are an angelEmbed
