Throwing Fire at the Sun LyricsI think of Venus
Sinking down into the sea
And what it is
To be alone and have nothing
I don't know why you
Want to leave this space between
Is it easier
To be alone and have nothing
You and me and everyone
Throwing fire at the sun
I put my hands up
Lay my weapons down
I know that I was stupid
I was wrong
You and me and everyone
Throwing fire at the sun
If I listen
There's something deeper that speaks
If we reach out
Maybe we could make a little peace
You and me and everyone
Throwing fire at the sun
Remember stealing
Oranges and how they bled
And you're the one who
Showed me how to touch myself
You and me and everyone
Throwing fire at the sun
Blood is a river, ties you to me
Blood is a river, ties everyone
Blood is a river, ties you to me
Blood is a river, ties everyone
Ties everyone
Ties everyoneEmbed
