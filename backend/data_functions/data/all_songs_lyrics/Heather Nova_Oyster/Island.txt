Island LyricsThere are parts of me he'll never know
My wild horses and my river beds
And in my throat voices he'll never hear
He pulls at me like a cherry tree
And I can still move, but I don't speak about it
Pretend I'm crazy, pretend I'm dead
He's to scared to hit me now, he'll bring flowers instead
I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you
Somewhere to go
And the dogwoods shimmer in October sun
"Oh sweet thing" he sings to me, "You're the only one."
I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you, somewhere
I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you, somewhere to go
And I don't know why I can't tell my sister
He spat in my face again, and I don't want to die here
You know that dream when your feet won't move
You want to come but your body won't let you
He steals it from me. He steals it from me
It shines like sweat, like jewels
Like something that has died to soon
He fucks with the beauty
A kiss, a kick, a kiss, a kick, a kiss kiss kick
He steals it from me
It's out of my hands again
I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island, somewhere to bury you
Somewhere to go, to go...Embed
