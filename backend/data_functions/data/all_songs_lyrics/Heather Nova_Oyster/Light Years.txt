Light Years LyricsYou found me
Drifting
Big motion like a bird
Strangest song i ever heard
Now, now that you're here
Stay with me light years
Light years, light years
No paper, no ring
In the trees where frogs sing
I brought lillies for you
Think of all the things were gonna do
Now, now that you're here
Stay with me ligt years
I give you a thousand hours
Making love in the tall sunflowers
I give you a thousand feet
Down were the water's deep
Sleepy storm, sleepy head
Limb for limb on my bed
Now, now that you're here
Stay with me light years
Light years, light years
Light years, stay with me
Stay with me, stayEmbed
