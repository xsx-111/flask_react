Doubled Up LyricsI saw a mountain from higher above
I held your hand and I was doubled up in love
Big sky above me, a river inside me
And I'm doubled up in love
You're watching your step but you fall as you're walking
You take it in stride but still you fall as you're walking
Big sky above me, a river inside me
And I'm doubled up in love
Feels good it feels like poetry
Don't ask me to explain it just
Feels good, like poetry
I'm doubled up again
Look at the sky
Lift off like an aeroplane
Watch the ground come up to meet you
Big sky above me, a river inside me
And I'm doubled up in love
Feels good, it feels like poetry
Don't ask me to explain it just
Feels good, like poetry
I'm doubled up againEmbed
