Walking Higher LyricsI carry you with me
A ghost inside
And in these shattered arms
You're still alive
I carry you with me
A holy shrine
And dogs and angels follow
Right behind
Could I be walking higher
Could I be right beside her?
The bones they buried
Will feed the trees
But every word you ever spoke
Is still in me
Could I be walking higher
Could I be right beside her?
And I will feel for you in the music
And I will send that river home
And I will cry for you sometimes
When the night is down
And I raise my head up to the mountains
Talk to the birds and I fly
'Cause the spirit lives on
When the body dies
And could I be walking higher
Could I be right beside her?
Could I be walking higher
Could I be right beside her?Embed
