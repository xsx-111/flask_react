Verona LyricsIt gets inside you like the sun
It makes you wet just like the rain
Makes you sound so sentimental
Oh its a lovely kind of pain
I used to dream
I used to dream about Verona
I used to dream
I used to dream about Verona
And if there ever was an earthquake
I’d go down in the earth with you
And if there ever was an avalanche
I’d landslide down with you
I used to dream
I used to dream about Verona
I used to dream
I used to lean over and side of boat
And get hypnotised by the water
It’s up in the trees it’s up to me
It’s out of the blue, out to you
I used to dream
I used to dream about verona
Yeah romeo you are priceless, lifeless
Skipping star to scar to star
I used to dream you’d be
Slipping, slipping from me
Burning, breathing, breathing
Sleeping, in me
I used to lean over the side of the boat
And get hypnotised by the water and dream
Slipping, slipping, slipping
Slipping from me
Burning, burning, breathing
Sleeping in meEmbed
