Lucky To Be Me LyricsI used to think it might be fun to be
Anyone else but me
I thought that it would be a pleasant surprise
To wake up as a couple of other guys
But now that I've found you
I've changed my point of view
And now I wouldn't give a dime to be
Anyone else but me
Oh, what a day
Fortune smiled and came my way
Bringing love I never thought I'd see
I'm so lucky to be me
What a night
Suddenly you came in sight
Looking just the way I'd hope you'd be
I'm so lucky to be me
I am simply thunderstruck
At this change in my luck
Knew at once I wanted you
Never dreamed you'd want me too
I'm so proud you chose me from all the crowd
There's no other guy I'd rather be
Oh, I could laugh out loud
I'm so lucky to be me
Yes, I'm so proud you chose me from all the crowd
There's no other guy I'd rather be
Oh, I could laugh out loud
I'm so lucky to be meEmbed
