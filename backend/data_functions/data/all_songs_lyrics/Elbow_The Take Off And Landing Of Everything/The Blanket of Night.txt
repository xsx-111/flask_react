The Blanket of Night LyricsPaper cup of a boat
Heaving chest of the sea
Carry both of us
Carry her
Carry me
From the place we were born
To the land of the free
Carry both of us
Carry her
Carry me
The ocean
That bares us from our home
Could save us
Or take us for its own
The danger
That life should lead us here
My angel
Could I have steered us clear?
Gone the light from her eyes
With the lives that we made
Just the two of us
In the night
On the waves
Moving silent her lips
By the moon's only light
Sewing silver prayers
In the blanket of night
The ocean
That bares us from our home
Could save us
Or take us for its own
The danger
That life should lead us here
My angel
Could I have steered us clear?
Paper cup of a boat
Heaving chest of the sea
Carry both of us or
Swallow her
Swallow me2Embed
