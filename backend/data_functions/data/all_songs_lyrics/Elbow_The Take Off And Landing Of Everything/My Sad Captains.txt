My Sad Captains LyricsI'm running out of miracles
Oh my soul
And the streets are lined with one-man shows
Oh my soul
Corner boys were moved along
Oh my soul
We're plummeting like crippled crows
Oh my soul
Oh, long before
You and I were born
Others beat these benches with their empty cups
To the night and its stars
To be here, and now, and who we are
Another sunrise with my sad captains
With who I choose to lose my mind
And if it's so we only pass this way but once
What a perfect waste of time
The BMX apothecary
Oh my soul
The architect of infamy
Oh my soul
For each and every train we miss
Oh my soul
A bitter little Eucharist
Oh my soul
Oh, long before
You and I were born
Others beat these benches with their empty cups
To the night and its stars
To be here, and now, and who we are
Another sunrise with my sad captains
With who I choose to lose my mind
And if it's so we only come this way but once
What a perfect waste of time
Another sunrise with my sad captains
With who I choose to lose my mind
And if it's so we only pass this way but once
What a perfect waste of time
Another sunrise with my sad captains
With who I choose to lose my mind
And if it's so we only pass this way but once
What a perfect waste of time
What a perfect waste of timeEmbed
