New York Morning Lyrics
The first to put a simple truth in words
Binds the world in a feeling all familiar
Cause everybody owns the great ideas
And it feels like there's a big one round the corner
Antenna up and out into New York
Somewhere in all that talk is all the answers
And oh my giddy aunt New York can talk
It's the modern Rome and folk are nice to Yoko
Every bone of rivet steel, each corner stone and angle
Jenga jut and rusted water, tower, pillar, post and sign
Every painted line and battered, laddered building in this town
Sings a life of proud endeavour and the best that man can be
Me, I see a city and I hear a million voices
Planning, drilling, welding, carrying their fingers to the nub
Reaching down Into the ground, stretching up into the sky
Why?
Because they can
They did and do
So you and I could live together

Oh my God New York can talk
Somewhere in all that talk is all the answers
Everybody owns the great ideas
And it feels like there's a big one round the corner

Oh my God New York can talk
Somewhere in all that talk is all the answers
Everybody owns the great ideas
And it feels like there's a big one round the corner

Oh my God New York can talk
Somewhere in all that talk is all the answers
Everybody owns the great ideas
And it feels like there's a big one round the corner

The desire in patchwork symphony
The desire like a distant storm
For love, did it come for me?
And it feels like there's a big one round the corner

The desire in patchwork symphony
(Oh my God New York can talk)
The desire like a distant storm
(Somewhere in all that talk is all the answers)
For love, did it come for me?
(Everybody owns the great ideas)
And it feels like there's a big one round the corner
The way the day begins
Decides the shade of everything
But the way it ends depends on if you're home
For every soul a pillow at a window please
In the modern Rome where folk are nice to YokoEmbed
