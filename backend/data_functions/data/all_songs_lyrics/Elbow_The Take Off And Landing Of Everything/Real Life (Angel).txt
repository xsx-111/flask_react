Real Life (Angel) Lyrics
If you wake in the quake in the roll of the heartbroken
Pounding the ground in a sawn off ballet
Bring us in an indigo dawn with the lovelorn and renegade
You always found peace in the grip of the beat, darling
Time alone with the pounding of your heart
As it starts to heal you'll find a better mirror in another

You I've never known dumbfounded
So out of reach and hollowed through
Blue and white the light and sound surrounded
As the music pulls you through
And on that hallelujah morning
In the arms of new love, the peace that you feel's real life

Go straight to the place where you first lost your balance
And find your feet with the people that you love
And bring us in an indigo dawn with the lovelorn and renegade
Yes you were the eyes of a men not forgotten
Get hold of the night that rises in your blood
Focus on your pulse, focus on your breath, know that we're never far away

You I've never known dumbfounded
So out of reach and hollowed through
Blue and white the light and sound surrounded
As the music pulls you through
And on that hallelujah morning
In the arms of new love, the peace that you feel's real life
Angel
Angel
Angel
Angel

You with the eyes of the men not forgotten
You with the eyes for the lonely whoever
You with the life that could bring down a tenement
Talking your way through the hearts of the citadel
Up on the tables, or shoulders of strangers, or
Under my arms we add to the waterfall
My little sister with blazing common
You'll never need fear a thing in this world while
I have a breath in me; blood in my veins
You'll never need fear thing in this world while
I have a breath in me; blood in my veins
You never need fear a thing in this blue world

You I've never known dumbfounded
So out of reach and hollowed through
Blue and white the light and sound surrounded
As the music pulls you through
And on that hallelujah morning
In the arms of new love, the peace that you feel's real life
Angel
