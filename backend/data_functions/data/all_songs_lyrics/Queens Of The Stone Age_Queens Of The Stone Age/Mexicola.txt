Mexicola Lyrics
Setting sun deals hands of gold
There's velvet eyes in Mexico
Just a fall away
And all she said was true
Speak in tongues, speak in lies
Drooling livers, born to die
It's a wonder that those guns don't point at you

Oh, oh, oh

Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever
Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever

Point and shoot
I know just what you mean
In a world that's full of shit and gasoline babe
One dog's dead, one's on the phone
Just leave a lung or leave it alone
It's that same old song again
I hate it 'cause it's true
Oh, oh
Ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo


Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever
Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever
