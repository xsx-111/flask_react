Give The Mule What He Wants Lyrics
You'll want it
You'll want it Sunday
He'll eat it
He'll eat it one day
How long, long, long
Do I wait, wait?
Be the mule that you gotta be, yeah

Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh

Underwater, underwater one day
Gonna sink it, make 'em think it's too late
For your love, love, love
For your love, love, love
Be the mule that you gotta be

Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh1Embed
