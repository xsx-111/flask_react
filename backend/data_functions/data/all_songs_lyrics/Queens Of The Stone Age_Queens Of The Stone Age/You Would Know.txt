You Would Know Lyrics
Me just happy robot
Live on hill of beans
You and I cut from same cloth
Ripping at the seams
Cut, snip, cut

Don't forget to remember
The devil's got pills in his eyes
Look, laugh, but don't touch
Cut you down to size
Cut up, cut (shut up)
Cut up, cut

You would know

My girl's all out of focus
It ain't no big surprise
Daddy got his gun loaded
Got cross hairs in his eyes
Shut up, oh
Shut up, oh
You would know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
