How To Handle a Rope Lyrics
Too late to think or filter any more
A bitter pill to swallow
Maybe you're in a blanket haze of ephedrine
I'm wondering where the hell you been
So come on and right this wrong, the rope

You got it all right
You got a feeling
I'd rather open up my wrist, let it go
You got it all right
You got a feeling
Because devils and ropes around your neck
Cursing them all
And you can't hear it
Can't hear it

Ain't got a mind to deal with any more
Saboteur infiltrator and maybe more
If you're not blind and deaf
How can we pollute your head
So come on and right this wrong
The rope
And I got it all right
I got a feeling
You'd rather open up your wrist, let it go
I got it all right, yeah
I got a feeling
There's devils and ropes around my neck
I can't even know
'Cause I can't hear it
Can't hear it
Can't hear it
Can't hear it2Embed
