I Was a Teenage Hand Model Lyrics

Cozied up to the toilet
Face stuck to the floor
I met expectations
That I was tryin' to ignore
Job had such patience
I wonder, what's that like?
One hundred thousand million (Years)
That's what you like?
So I was thinking

Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!

So these cities are sprouting
Like a spit in the eye
And this world isn't waiting
It's just passin' me by
I just peak in the window
Looking inside
The butcher's got a fork in your face and
I'm standing in line?
And I was singing
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
