Bury Me Deep Inside Your Heart LyricsLet me wake up in your arms
Hear you say, "It's not all right"
Let me be so dead and gone
So far away from life
Close my eyes
Hold me tight
And bury me deep inside your heart
All I ever wanted was you, my love
You...all I ever wanted is you, my love
You're all I ever wanted, just you
Let me never see the sun
And never see you smile
Let us be so dead and so gone
So far away from life
Just close my eyes
Hold me tight
And bury me deep inside your heart
All I ever wanted was you, my love
You...all I ever wanted is you, my love
You're all I ever wanted, you, oh, my love
You're all I ever wanted, you, my love
That's the way it's always been
My heart stops beating only for you, baby
Only for you, darling
All I ever wanted is you, my love
You...all I ever wanted is you, my love
You're all I ever wanted, you, my love
You're all I ever wanted, you, my loveEmbed
