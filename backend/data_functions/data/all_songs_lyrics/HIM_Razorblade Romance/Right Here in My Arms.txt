Right Here in My Arms Lyrics
She is smiling like heaven's down on earth
Sun is shining so bright on her
And all her wishes have finally come true
And her heart is weeping
This happiness is killing her
It's true she's in love

She'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go
She'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go
I know
So hard she's trying
But her heart won't turn to stone
Oh no
And she keeps on crying
But I won't leave her alone
She'll never be alone
She'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go
She'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go
And she'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go

She'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go
She'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go
She's in love
She's so in love
She's in love
She's so in love1Embed
