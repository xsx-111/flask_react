One Last Time LyricsIs it so hard to believe our hearts are made to be broken by love?
That in constant dying lies the beauty of it all
My darling, won't you feel
Love sweet heaven in our endless cry?
Oh, at least you could try
For this one last time
Ever amazed how bright are the flames we are burning in
Ever smiled at the tragedies we hold inside
My darling, won't you cherish
The fear of life that keeps you and me so alive?
Oh, at least you could try
For this one last time
It could be all right
For this one last time
Oh, at least you could try
(Let me just to be closer)
For this one last time
(Let me fall into your arms)
It could be all right
(Don't let us grow any colder)
For this one last time
(Let me close to your heart)
Oh, at least you could try
(Before it's all over)
For this one last time
(Let me fall into your arms)
It could be all right
(Before it's all over)
For this one last time
(Let me close to your heart)
Oh, at least you could try
(Before it's all over)
For this one last time
(Let me fall into your arms)
It could be all rightEmbed
