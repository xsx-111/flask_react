Razorblade Kiss LyricsI taste death in every kiss we share
Every sundown seems to be the last we have
Your breath on my skin has the scent of our end
I'm drunk on your tears, baby, can't you see it's hurting
Every time we touch, we get closer to heaven
And at every sunrise our sins are forgiven
Uh, uh
You on my skin, this must be the end
The only way you can love me is to hurt me again
And again
And again
And again
Your love is a razorblade kiss
Sweetest is the taste from your lips
Your love is a razorblade kiss
Sweetest is the taste from your lips
Oh the taste from your lips, my darling
Taste from your lips, oh my love
Only inside you, I'm free
I'm tired of waiting
You've got to let me dream
Inside you, baby
I'm not afraid to feel
I want you to love me
'Cause you are the one
'Cause you are the one
'Cause you are the one
Your love is a razorblade kiss
Sweetest is the taste from your lips
Your love is a razorblade kiss
Sweetest is the taste from your lips
Your love is a razorblade kiss
Sweetest is the taste from your lips
Your love is a razorblade kiss
Sweetest is the taste from your lipsEmbed
