Join Me in Death Lyrics
Baby, join me in death
Baby, join me in death
Baby, join me in death

We are so young
Our lives have just begun
But already we are considering
Escape from this world
And we've waited for so long
For this moment to come
We're so anxious to be together
Together in death

Would you die tonight for love?
Baby, join me in death
Would you die?
Baby, join me in death
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby, join me in death

This world is a cruel place
And we're here only to lose
So before life tears us apart
Let death bless me with you
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby, join me in death
Would you die?
Baby, join me in death
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby, join me in death

This life ain't worth livin'
This life, it ain't worth livin'
This life, it ain't worth livin'
This life ain't worth livin'

Would you die tonight for love?
Baby, join me in death
Would you die?
Baby, join me in death
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby, join me in death
Baby join me in deathEmbed
