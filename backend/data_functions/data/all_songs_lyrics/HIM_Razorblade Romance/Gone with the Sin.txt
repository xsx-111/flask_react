Gone with the Sin Lyrics
I love your skin
Oh so white
I love your touch
Cold as ice
And I love every single tear you cry
I just love the way you're losing your life

Woah, my baby
How beautiful you are
And woah, my darling
Completely torn apart
You're gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
So gone with the sin, my darling

I adore the despair in your eyes
I worship your lips, once red as wine
And I crave for your scent
Sending shivers down my spine
And I just love the way you're running out of life

Woah, my baby
How beautiful you are
And woah, my darling
Completely torn apart
You're gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
So gone with the sin, my darling
Woah, my baby
How beautiful you are
And woah, my darling
Completely torn apart
You're gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
So gone with the sin, my darling3Embed
