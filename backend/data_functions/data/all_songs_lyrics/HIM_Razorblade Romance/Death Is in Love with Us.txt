Death Is in Love with Us LyricsI know it hurts too much
I know that you're scared
I know you're running out of trust
And wishing you were dead
But in your misery
You're not alone
So come share your tears with me
And witness it all go wrong
I know it and I feel it
Just as well as you do, honey
It's not our fault if Death's in love with us, oh, oh
It's not our fault if the Reaper holds our hearts
Forty-one plus 66.6 equals our loss
We're breathing only to fade away
We're running just to get caught
What love's lies blessed
What love's light cursed
Just fear for the best
And hope for our worst
I know it and I feel it
Just as well as you do, honey
It's not our fault if Death's in love with us, oh, oh
It's not our fault if the Reaper holds our hearts
Death's in love with us, oh, oh
The Reaper holds our hearts, oh, oh
Death's in love with us, oh, oh
And the Reaper holds our hearts
I know it and I feel it
Just as well as you do, honey
It's not our fault if Death's in love with us, oh, oh
It's not our fault if the Reaper holds our heartsEmbed
