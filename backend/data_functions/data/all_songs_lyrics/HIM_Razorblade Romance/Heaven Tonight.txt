Heaven Tonight LyricsI hold your hand in mine
I hold your hand and you're so lonely
Oh, so lonely
Your eyes have lost their light
Your eyes have lost their light and you're empty
Oh, my God, you're so empty
(I'm in love with you)
You are my heaven tonight
(I'm in love with you)
You are my heaven tonight
Trying to find the heart you hide
Trying to find the heart you hide in vain
Oh, in vain
And you're my heaven in life
And you're my heaven in death, baby
Life and death, my darling
(I'm in love with you)
You are my heaven tonight
That's right
(I'm in love with you)Embed
