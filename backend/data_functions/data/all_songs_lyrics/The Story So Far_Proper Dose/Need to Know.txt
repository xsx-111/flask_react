Need to Know Lyrics
You made me different from all I have been
It's only getting harder to keep it out in the open
My nights feel longer
My lips are stretched thin
It's not getting any better
What kind of pain are you having?

There's no more patience
I almost hate this
There's no more targets
Nothing I can miss
I'm clearly out here
Out in the open

All you need to know
Is that while I'm away
I've got time to think about it
I know I'm better off without it
They're on a "need to know"
There's not much I can do
Besides lay it all around you
With all the ways I feel about you
I wanna get along now
I know you feel different
Leave me with something
Something I can't miss
I wanna feel good now
Help drag me off this
'Cause I wanna get better
And go to all of these places

There's no more patience
I almost hate this
There's no more targets
Nothing I can miss
I'm clearly out here
Out in the open

All you need to know
Is that while I'm away
I've got time to think about it
I know I'm better off without it
They're on a "need to know"
There's not much I can do
Besides lay it all around you
With all the ways I feel about you
All you need to know
Is that while I'm away
I've got time to think about it
I know I'm better off without it
They're on a "need to know"
There's not much I can do
Besides lay it all around you
With all the ways I feel about you
