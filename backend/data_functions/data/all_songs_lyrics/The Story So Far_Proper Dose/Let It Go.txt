Let It Go Lyrics
Anytime you come around I feel alone
I don’t need your help can you tell from my tone
Try to keep it casual nothing there to break the fall

All this time I spend with you is not enough
Know you’re sad inside so why you act so tough
Fed up with my usual quit it cold and feel the lull

Let it go, there’s no lust now
I’m way ahead of you
Can you hear me now?
I’m on your radio
Can you pull me apart just the way you do?

Anytime I see your face it’s just my own
I’ll be fine, just look how much that I’ve grown
How did you stay there I didn’t play fair
You and I might be the only thing I know
Set aside a place for both of us to go
I feel your hand inside of mine
No, I don’t never mind
Let it go, there’s no lust now
I’m way ahead of you
Can you hear me now?
I’m on your radio
Can you pull me apart just the way you do?

Let it go, there’s no lust now
I’m way ahead of you
Can you hear me now?
I’m on your radio
Can you pull me apart
I won't let it bring me down again1Embed
