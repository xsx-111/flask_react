Grand Paradise Lyrics
I can be romantic
When I'm starving for sleep
When I try but I can't seem
To remember anything
With hair from a dog
I’ve got a fistful of its mane
It’s too coarse to stomach
So I shove it down my throat
Luck left late Saturday, and now…

Jesus Christ, I'm wrecked to bed
They watch me sleepin' in the kennel again
I can't recall the bark, but the bay, I admit
If I was listenin', I could hear it

I’m shock-collared at the gates of Heaven
25 years that I’ve been tryna shake loose
And if I try to sit still
Then someone's breathin' down my neck
Oh, so I'm embarrassin' myself again
I should see myself out
Lay me down in the tub
Throw away my phone
Strap a muzzle to my mouth now
And Jesus Christ, I'm wrecked to bed
They watch me sleepin' in the kennel again
I can't recall the bark, but the bay, I admit
If I was listenin', I could hear it
If I was listenin', I could hear it

If I listen, I can hear
Palms kept white, hot, gold rings folded like a
Knot tied tight, sweat, leave, sleep, take me now
I've done nothing right
I've gone wrong beside
I can't see what's there
But if I listen, I can hear
Luck bent, low roar, drum pressed to the glass
The glass pressed loose, soft spots marked on the wall
Wall an empty stomach
I've done nothing right
I can't see what's there
If I listen, I can hear it

Palms kept white, hot, gold rings folded like a
Knot tied tight, sweat, leave, sleep, take me now
I've done nothing right
I've gone wrong beside
I can't see what's there
I can't see anything at allEmbed
