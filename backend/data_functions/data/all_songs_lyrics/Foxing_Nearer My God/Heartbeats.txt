Heartbeats Lyrics
Never the taste of fear
You got left in the fine print
The font was serif'd and tasteless
It was slanted and Latin to death
They Said “Come on and get off of the bridge
And we can take the cameras down”
When all you really want is somewhere between here and the ground

You are not in love
You are not in love
You are not in love
So stop playing along

They found the fountain of youth
Why would they strike the cameras now?
The malaise set in here
And no ones making any sound
They said “Come on tell us everything”
From the gallows
A Penitent
Begging forgiveness
They told you instead:
"Pull that rat heart out of your chest
It doesn't mean anything to us now”
You are not in love
You are not in love
You are not in love
So stop playing along
So stop playing along

(Your heart beats with us now)

You are not in love
You are not in love
You are not in love
So stop playing along
AlongEmbed
