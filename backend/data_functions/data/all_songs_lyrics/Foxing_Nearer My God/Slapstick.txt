Slapstick Lyrics
I walk around with a headglow
Shrugging my shoulders
Fucking up everything
And they won't stop following me
Holed up in a tower
Sucking inheritance
So mock up a thirty second
TV corroborative defamation

Now hold open the door so I can fall in

So I'm on the floor with a halo
Face in the carpet
Laces in sheepshank
With a hyena cackle from Vishnu
Protection has ended
You pay up to no thanks
So you mock up an ad, gag a press pit
The weatherâ€™s the same if you're born in '46

Now hold open the door so I can fall in
Hold open the door so I can fall in
Hold open the door so I can fall in
Hold open the door so I can fall in
There's no more sun and no more light shine through
There's no more sun and no more light shine through

I walk around with a headglow
Spoiled and ancient
Taking vacations
(No more sun and no more)
Always vacations
(Light shine through)
Now I'm on the floor with a halo
A headache from bad coke
So keep all the lights low
(No more sun and no more)
Now keep all the lights low
(Light shine through)

Would you hold open the door so I can fall in?
There's no more sun and no more light shine through
Would you hold open the door so I can fall in?
There's no more sun and no more light shine through
Hold open the door so I can fall in
Could you hold open the door so I can fall in?
No more light shines through
Just hold open the door so I can fall in1Embed
