Five Cups Lyrics
Mouth on the tap to chase the Klonopin back
Hand me the keys
And a crucifix
Hallucinated Dan, at least I thought it was Dan
At Rose Duchesne
I blew a kiss to him

I want to drive with my eyes closed
I want to drive with my eyes closed

Behind
Circle K parking lot trying to light
A left behind
Broken Camel Wide
Hallucinate Samantha with an Axe Head and cried
At pump five
Said “get home safe tonight”

I want to drive with my eyes closed
I want to drive with my eyes closed
I want to drive with my eyes closed
I won’t wait
(I want to keep my eyes closed)
I won’t wait
(I want to keep my eyes closed)
I won’t wait
(I want to keep my eyes closed)
I won’t wait
(I want to keep my eyes closed)
I won’t wait
(I want to keep my eyes closed)
(I want to keep my eyes closed)

Ozarks hold off the rites
When it's cold I’d like
One more taste of a try
Before I suck up the bath
And leave them behind
Behind
I won't wait
I won't wait to be saved
I feel off and pray to be
Between Florence and Coleen
Somewhere I can see them
When it's raining all the time
I can't see what I'm leaving
Behind
I won't wait
I won't wait to be saved
If a bonfire’s smoke
Tends to follow you some night
I'll crackle like a radio from the gates
Won’t seem to find a reason not to leave
Behind
I won't wait
I won't wait to be saved

Behind
I won’t wait
I won’t wait to be savedEmbed
