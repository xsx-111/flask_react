Crown Candy Lyrics
Cursed on the odds by Father Mark
The Parish Picnic, Spring ‘07
Said “Take the bet or burn in hell”
It seems like god gets enough attention

“But he’s starving for your compliments”
And I’m placing my bets on you
“You’re in Pascal’s hell and you’re still happy”
I'm wasting my life on you

I’m high with you when the sirens blare
The violent start to the violent end
Outside a sax sings Karen Carpenter
A kiss for luck and we’re on our way

“So we’ve only just begun to live”
I’m wasting my life on you
Yeah “kiss for luck and we’re on our way”
I’m wasting my life on you
I’m wasting my life on you
Wasting my life on you
Wasting my time
Wasting my time
Wasting my time

I’m wasting my life on you
“Last gasp on this helpless rock was”
Was wasted on “I love you”Embed
