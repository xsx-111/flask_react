Nearer My God Lyrics
I want it all
I'll watch the bridges all burn
And I'll be your dog
I'd be a darling for you
Or anyone who wants me at all
Does anybody want me at all?

'Cause I'd sell my soul
To be America's pool boy
The crown centerfold
My few good years left, a tribute
To anyone who wants me at all
Does anybody want me at all?
Oh, do you want me at all?

Do you want me at all?
Do you want me at all?
Aw, do you want me at all?

I've got it all
I feel the love in suspension
And nearer my god
At hallowed ground, holding hands
Ashing cigarettes on gravestones
Pin photographs on cork boards
Unfollowing my dead friends
Someone's gonna love me
Oh, do you want me?
Do you want me at all?

Do you want me at all?1Embed
