Gameshark Lyrics
Gainer from the balcony
Swan dive into the concrete
They served you venison and morphine
Nobel'd you for your good deeds
It's in the twelve steps
Against a death threat
It's like a seat belt
Against a hurricane
You're in the first class
Against a tailspin
With the dizygotic twin of god in the cockpit

Ooo
You try to turn it off
But you're too turned on by it
Ooo
You try to wake up

So you're a lost lamb dying on the range in the heat
Soft guts waving  on the vulture come and get the meat
And served you television in a tyranny
They Teen Choice'd you for your good grief
Is it the slow stalk
From the philistine
Or in the wolf club
Against instinct
Or in the Red Cross
Against the hidebound
With the dizygotic twin of god at the slaughterhouse
Ooo
You try to turn it off
But you're too turned on by it
Ooo
You try to wake up
But then you're over it
You're over it

Stumbled drunk out on the balcony
Saw the moonlight in the concrete
The band played "Nearer My God To Thee"
Death was begging for your company
Was it the Brown bag
Around the Popov
Or in the Six men
Carrying the casket
Beak of a dead dove
Broken and stomped on
While the dizygotic twin of god owns the flower shop

But you're too turned on by it
You try to turn it off
But you're too turned on by it
You try to turn it off
But you're too turned on by it
Now you try to wake up
But then you're over itEmbed
