Lich Prince Lyrics
Glued up
I feel so
Insulated
I feel desperate
I could wake up
But I won't
I feel slowed down
I've been shortchanged with the lord for too long
Iâ€™ve been thinking of new ways
To fuck with old friends
I just want real love for you
I just want real love for you

I just want real love for you
I just want real love for you
I just want real love for you
I just want real love for you

I was drowned out
I was worthless
Than where I was
When you said I was rotten
Been thinking of new ways
To take old drugs
Been thinking of shortcuts
To dead ends
I just want real love for you
I just want real love for you
I just want real love for you
I just want real love for you

For you
For you
For you
I feel like a house plant
For you
I feel like a house plant
For you
I feel like a house plant
For you
I feel like a house plant

You
For you1Embed
