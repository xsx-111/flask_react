Bastardizer Lyrics
Let down and fallen out to be
Coked up and gone fleeing south
You're disengaged
While she stays home
To pick up your tabs
Cause you're just horny
With secret texts
From other names
In your old phone
By the picture frames

And you think I must not remember
You think I must not remember
But I do
I must not remember

Here lies the magician
He was survived by applause but still can't listen
The Bastardizer
The patron saint
Of disconnection
Of feel-no-shame
He leaves his son
Who has your name
When you're finally gone
He'll be okay
You think I must not remember
But I do
You think I must not remember
But I do, I do
You think I must not remember
You think I must not remember
You think I must not remember
Must not remember

(I must not remember)
Runaway father
You swear him away
Now that you're absent
You find it okay
Next generation
It's feeling the same
Raising themselves up but can't forget your name
(I must not remember)
Runaway father
You swear him away
Now that you're absent
You find it okay
Next generation
It's feeling the same
Raising themselves up but can't forget your name
I must not remember1Embed
