Lambert Lyrics
Mayan-hearted in Gatwick
I was golden in LaGuardia
If I step one foot back in Lambert
I'm one step out of the wrong

Give back a note from the other one
Tell them all to go home
Give back a note from the other one
Tell them all to go home
Give back a note from the other one

You're a soul unhitched from flesh
You're the invisible fence
And if I make it through customs
Then I'm two steps out of the wrong

Give back a note from the other one
Tell them all to go home
Give back a note from the other one
Tell them all to go home

I spent so long at the gates
Heaven won't take me in
And I threw up so many times on the way
Heaven won't take me in
Heaven won't take me in
Gave back a note from the other one
To tell them all to go home
Gave back a note from the other one
To tell them all to go home
Gave back a note from the other oneEmbed
