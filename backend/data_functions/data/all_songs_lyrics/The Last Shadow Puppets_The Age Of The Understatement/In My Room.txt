In My Room Lyrics
In my room she'll get to you
In my room she'll get to you
In my room

Could I turn on a lie, impress unknown eyes?
Humour absorbs the thoughts, churning the motionless talks
Seeing things with a second glance
As she turns through her magazines

In my room she'll get to you
In my room she'll get to you
In my room

Could I turn on a lie, impress unknown eyes?
Humour absorbs the thoughts, lift up your sorted heads
Played like dancing fools, turning the tension 'round
Building up silent sounds

Just another day, all in my room
Struck out like before, all in my room
Room, room
Room, room2Embed
