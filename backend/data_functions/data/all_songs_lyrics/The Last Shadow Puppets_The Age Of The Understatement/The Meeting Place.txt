The Meeting Place Lyrics
The colder the night gets, the further she strays
And he doesn't like it being this way
And she tried so hard to steer away from the meeting place
But her heart had led her there

She clings to his consciousness wherever he lays
He struggles to sleep at night and during the day
He's worried she's waiting in his dreams
To drag him back to the meeting place
His love had left him there

Where her voice still echoes
"I'm sorry I met you, darling, I'm sorry I met you"
As she turned into the night, all he had was the words
"I'm sorry I met you, darling, I'm sorry I've left you"

For weeks they had strolled around, playing the fools
They knew the time would come and time would be cruel
Because it is cruel to everyone
He's crying out from the meeting place
He's stranded himself there
Where her voice still echoes
"I'm sorry I met you, darling, I'm sorry I met you"
As she turned into the night, all he had was the words
"I'm sorry I met you, darling, I'm sorry I've left you"

"I'm sorry I met you, darling, I'm sorry I've left you"11Embed
