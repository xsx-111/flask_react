Black Plant Lyrics
You bit your lip and on the tip of your tongue was your view
He hadn't dealt with how you felt in ways that suited you
Got paper cuts from the love letters you never gave him
Could not meet your new-found needs for misbehaving

Why, why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you, why would you say?

You said there was a nagging lack of smiles
When dancing on your back
Tenderness aplenty but that wasn't what you craved
There's holes in hearts, desire starts to make demands
And dear boy, you'd be a fool to make your plans with her

Why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you, why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you?

When it's just one of many bullets you will bite
While waiting for a ray of light
Waiting for a ray of light
Waiting for a ray of light
The paper cuts from the love letters you never gave him
Could not meet your new-found needs for misbehaving

Why, why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you, why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you say sorry?
Oh, why would you?
(Why would you?) Why would you say sorry?
(Why would you?) Why would you say sorry?
(Why would you?) Why would you say sorry?
(Why would you?) Why would you say sorry?
(Why would you? Why would you?
Why would you? Why would you?)3Embed
