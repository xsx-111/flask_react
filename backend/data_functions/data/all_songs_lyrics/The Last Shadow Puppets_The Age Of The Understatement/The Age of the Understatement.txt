The Age of the Understatement Lyrics
Decided to sneak off away from your stomach
And try your pulse
They captured what seemed all unknowing and candid
But they suspected it was false
She's playful
The boring would warn you, be careful of her brigade
In order to tame this relentless marauder
Move away from the parade

And she was walking on the tables in the glasshouse
Endearingly bedraggled in the wind
Subtle in her method of seduction
Twenty little tragedies begin

And she would throw a feather boa in the road
If she thought that it would set the scene
Unfittingly dipped into your companions
Enlighten them to make you seethe

And there's affection to rent
The age of the understatement
Before the attraction ferments
Kiss me properly and pull me apart
Affection to rent
The age of the understatement
Before this attraction ferments
Kiss me properly and pull me apart
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
And my fingers scratch at my hair
Before my mind can get too reckless
The idea of seeing you here
Is enough to make the sweat go cold

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh6Embed
