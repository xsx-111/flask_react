Only the Truth Lyrics
Only the truth she reckons she holds
Only the truth she reckons she holds

The way she walks is scripted and taught
Don't give her an eye or she'll sniper your mind
See by her hands that she's been there before
She lifts up her glass as if to bring down the mass

Only the truth she reckons she holds
Only the truth she reckons she holds

Climbing the stairs as if to follow her prayers
Her golden-laced boots may stop you right there
Hand on your arm as she greets all your friends
Then with a twist of a lime it seems a bitter end

Only the truth she reckons she holds
Only the truth she reckons she holds

The girl with many different strategies
Wakes the wolves to curse them to their knees
She's in the one by the riverbank so it's easier for her to drown you
And she claims, oh, she claims
It's only the truth she holds in her hands
Yes, it's only the truth she holds in her handsEmbed
