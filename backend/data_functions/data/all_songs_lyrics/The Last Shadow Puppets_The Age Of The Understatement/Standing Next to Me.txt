Standing Next to Me Lyrics
Want her, have her, two years have gone now
But I can't relate to the never-ending games that you play
As desire passes through, then you're open to the truth
I hope you understand

And your love is standing next to me
Is standing next to me

The one you fell for makes it seem juvenile
And you'll laugh at yourself again and again
And we'll drink to the thought she'll remember you
Maybe tomorrow

And your love is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
And your love is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me

Want her, have her, two years have gone now
But I can't relate to the never-ending games that you play
As desire passes through, then you're open to the truth
I hope you understand

And your love is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me8Embed
