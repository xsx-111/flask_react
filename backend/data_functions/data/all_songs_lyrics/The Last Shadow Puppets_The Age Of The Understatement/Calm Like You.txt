Calm Like You Lyrics
I can still remember when your city smelt exciting
I still get a whiff of that aroma now and then
Burglary and fireworks, the skies, they were alighting
Accidents and toffee drops and thinking on the train

Oh, he was young, in the frost
No regard for the cost of saying his feelings
In the moments they were felt
And if he was calm like you
Locked up inside of your loops
Then he'd know full well
That all he had to say was
All he had to say was goodbye

Summertime made promises it knew it couldn't keep
The fairytale was climbing up a mountain far too steep
Colouring the pictures with your royal hands
Now I am craving heartbreak while you're making your demands

Oh, he was young, in the frost
No regard for the cost of saying his feelings
In the moment they were felt
And if he was calm like you
Locked up inside of your loops
Then he'd know full well
That all he had to say was
All he had to say was goodbye
If he was calm like you
Locked up inside of your loops
Then he'd know full well
That all he had to say was
All he had to say was goodbye10Embed
