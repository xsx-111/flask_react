The Chamber Lyrics
(Leave yourself alone)
Leave yourself alone
(Leave yourself alone)
Can't you see you're only here to be torn apart?
Based upon a nothingness
So leave yourself alone (Alone)
Leave yourself alone (Alone)

(Tell your wasted time)
Tell your wasted time
(Tell your wasted time)
That I am worse and I would waste it all
Given the chance, I owe apologies
So tell your wasted time (Time)
Tell your wasted time (Time)

It's torture locked inside the chamber

(Cornered by yourself)
Cornered by yourself
(Cornered by yourself)
You said you must admit that you are the instigator
Hanging on to arguments
And you're cornered by yourself (Self)
Cornered by yourself (Self)
It's torture locked inside the chamber
Lost inside the chamber
Locked inside the chamber4Embed
