Separate and Ever Deadly Lyrics
When we walked the streets together
All the faces seemed to smile back
And now the pavements have nothing to offer
And all the faces seem to need a slap
There's an unfamiliar grip
On an unfamiliar handkerchief
Attending to the tears on cheeks I wouldn't notice with you
No matter how vicious the grief

Her expression was damp and crooked
Grabs onto my throat and won't let go
Won't let go, won't let go, won't let go

Save me from (the secateurs)
I'll pretend (I didn't hear)
Can't you see I'm a ghost in the wrong coat?
Biting butter and crumbs

There's a handsome maverick
You don't talk about to keep me calm
And I can't help if I create a version
That pulls you back onto his arm
Please don't tell me
You don't have to, darling, I can sense
That he painted you a gushing sunset
And slayed angry panthers in your defence
And he stands separate and ever deadly
Clings onto my throat and won't let go
Won't let go, won't let go, won't let go

Save me from (the secateurs)
I'll pretend (I didn't hear)
Can't you see I'm a ghost in the wrong coat?
Biting butter and crumbs


Save me from (the secateurs)
I'll pretend (I didn't hear)
Can't you see I'm a ghost in the wrong coat?
Biting butter and crumbs2Embed
