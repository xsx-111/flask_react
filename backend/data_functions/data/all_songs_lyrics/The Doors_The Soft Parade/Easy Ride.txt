Easy Ride Lyrics
And I know
It will be
An easy ride, all right
And I know
It will be
Easy ride, ok

The mask that you wore
My fingers would explore
Costume of control
Excitement soon unfolds

And I know
It will be
Easy ride, yeah
Joy, for vaguely
Wishful pride
Wishful pride, yeah

Black polished stone
Black polished stone
I see your eyes
Like burning glass
Like burning glass
Hear you smile, smile, babe
The mask that you wore
My fingers would explore
Costume of control
Excitement soon unfolds, hey
Easy, baby
Call the queen, now
Be my bride
Raging darkness
By my side
Seize the summer
In your pride
Take the winter
In your stride
Let's ride, yeah
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, ease, easy
Yeah, yeah, ride
Dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum
