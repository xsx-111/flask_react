Wishful Sinful Lyrics
Wishful crystal
Water covers everything in blue
Cooling water

Wishful sinful
Our love is beautiful to see
I know where I would like to be
Right back where I came

Wishful, sinful, wicked blue
Water covers you
Wishful, sinful, wicked you
Can't escape the blues

Magic rising
Sun is shining deep beneath the sea
But not enough for you and me and sunshine
Love to hear the wind cry

Wishful sinful
Our love is beautiful to see
I know where I would like to be
Right back where I came
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue
Water covers you
Wishful, sinful, wicked you
Can't escape the blues

Love to hear the wind cry
Love to hear you cry, yeah, yeahEmbed
