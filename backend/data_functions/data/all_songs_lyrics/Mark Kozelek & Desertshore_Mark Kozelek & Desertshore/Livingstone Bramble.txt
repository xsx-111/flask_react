Livingstone Bramble LyricsLivingstone Bramble
Had a pretty good rumble
With Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini
Watched it last night on my TV
On Classic ESPN
Laying in bed next to my girlfriend
Drifted off looking at the ceiling
With a pretty good feeling
And I lay awake all night long
Thinking "Man, that Bramble sure was strong."
And I lay awake all night long
The foghorns blew on and on
I got up and I went to the studio
Got stopped by a crackhead named Jerome
He had a lot to get off his chest
He wanted some money and he was homeless
I gave him some time and twenty bucks
I shook his hand and I said good luck
Then I went to the delicatessen
Got a bottle of water for my session
And I worked out a couple of songs
And I played my guitar all day long
And I worked out a couple of songs
And I played my guitar all day long
I can play like Fripp or Johnny Marr
And I can play circles round Jay Farrar
I like Jeff Beck and Page just fine
But I hate Derek Trucks and Nels Cline
I hate Nels Cline
Got in late last night from the studio
Keith Thurman had a fight on HBO
The rounds went past pretty goddamn slow
But he left with a record of 20 and 0
It was 3 a.m. and my girl was asleep
It was 11 a.m. in Cadiz
So I called my Spanish promoter
About a tour coming up in October
It was 4 a.m. when I hung up
And I cuddled up next to my love
It was 4 a.m. when I went to bed
Couldn't shut the guitars off in my head
I can play like Malcolm and Neil Young
And I can play circles round most anyone
I like Kirk Hammett and Steve Vai
But I hate Eric Clapton and Nels Cline
I hate Nels ClineEmbed
