Mariette LyricsI hear the drunken howls
Comin' up from St. Charles
Here in New Orleans
I can't complain about anything
The sweet taste of everything
Walking down Magazine
Or down Esplanade
Before the cool oak tree shade
And then Mariette asks
Why haven't you asked me to marry you yet
And then a '78 Cadillac drove by
And I seem to forget
At Elizabeth's
7 early evening
We walked back to the hotel from
Gallier along the Mississippi River
To the Faubourg Marigny
Stopped on Frenchman Street
Got a table outside
And had a nice coffee
And then Mariette asks
Why haven't you asked me to have your children yet
Then a friend of mine came and met us
And I seemed to forget
Headin' to the airport
Lookin' at the Superdome
Thinkin' bout all the people who'd
Lost their lives and their homes
Then I look off to the east
To the Crystal factory
Content as can be
Just to be in your company
And then Mariette asks
Why haven't you asked me to spend
The rest of your life with you yet and I paid
The taxi fare and I seemed to forgetEmbed
