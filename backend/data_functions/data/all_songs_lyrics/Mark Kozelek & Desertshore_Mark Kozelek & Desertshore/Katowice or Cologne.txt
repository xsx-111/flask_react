Katowice or Cologne LyricsWalkin' down west 33rd street
To Macy's past Jack Dempsey's
Past the neon lights in Madison Square
I need a heavier coat to wear
Where are you off to, where are you goin'?
Went off to Germany and then to Poland
Myslowice or Katowice
Oh baby can I get a kiss?
Another taste of your sweetness
Another night in your heavenliness
Another look at you wearing nothing
But that bracelet on your skinny wrist
I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was summer on the beach St. Augustine
And the water was warm and blue
I was playing in a small room
I met a brunette in a pretty dress
Went to her AC'ed apartment
She smoked a joint and she drank absinthe
And laid there like a slab of cement
And I left and we lost touch
Shit I can't say I really missed her much
And when I left we fell out of touch
And I doubt she ever thought of me much
I woke up and I didn't wanna go
Looked out the window at the blinding white snow
But I still got my taxi though
Said goodbye, shut off my phone
I waited for an hour at the terminal
Writing notes in my moleskin journal
After all these years I still panic
When I cross the goddamn Atlantic
Squeezed into seat 33b
Sippin' Starbucks gunpowder tea
Try to remember some of my tunings
All of them C-G-C-F-G-C
Well it's all I ever really need
To get from point A to point Z
To get from alesund to leaning tree
And in the worst shape I can always sing
Jetlagged as fuck in Beijing
After a sleepless all night fling
With the stomach flu in Ireland
With strep throat in Newfoundland
I just need a decent guitar tone
And a 58 microphone
A pretty girl in the front row
I don't need a drink, I don't need no blow
To get through a two hour show
In Katowice or Cologne
Oh when I get home
Gonna sleep til the cows come home
And take a little trip you know
Out to Anchorage or Juneau
Maybe Oaxaca, Mexico
Oh fuck I really don't know
What I'm gonna do when I'm home
I might just stay in San Francisco
Take a weekend in Pescadero
Dig up some abalone
Go fishin' for some cabazone
Go fishin for some sandsharks
Go fishin' till it gets dark
Go pickin' some artichokes
Then run a hot bath and soak
Then run a hot bath and soakEmbed
