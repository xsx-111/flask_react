Tavoris Cloud LyricsI miss my afternoon naps
My kitty-cat sleeping on my lap
But she died August two thousand eleven
Just got back from Norway she slipped off to kitty heaven
Last night I had to laugh out loud
When Hopkins beat Tavoris Cloud
At the age of 48
No fighter ever was that great
This morning I woke up at nine
Your body pressed hard against mine
And my mind began to race
With all the business sitting on my plate
This morning I woke up at nine
Your body pressed hard against mine
And I felt grateful for your love, and I felt grateful for your love
But at the age of 46 I'm still one fucked-up little kid
Who cannot figure anything out
Who gets upset and stomps and pouts
And at the age of 46 I'm still one fucked-up little kid
Who has my fears and has my doubts
Who has my challenges and bouts
And though I moved out here I know
I'm still that kid from Ohio
Who still has hopes and still has dreams
Who's still not learned a fucking thing
And though I moved out here I know
I'm still that kid from Ohio
Who's living in a world that I'm still getting to know
Two-thousand-twelve last July every night for a week I cried and cried
When I got the news that my old friend
Tim Mooney died
My heart dropped dead
My mind it spun
Thinking 'bout the times when we were younger
And how my band looked up to Tim
And all the guys who played with him
Sometimes I still can not believe
Tim Mooney died at 53
He seemed to be more stronger
He was too young to up and leave
Sometimes it's still hard to believe
Tim Mooney died at 53
There in Petaluma in his kitchen
Oh how his wife and daughter miss him
And at the age of 46 I'm still one fucked-up little kid
Who grew up in the sticks
Whose bad habits I can't kick
And at the age of 46 I'm still one fucked-up little kid
Who grew up in the sticks
Who has my hang-ups and my ticks
And though I live out here I know
I'm still that kid from Ohio
Still digging for something
And what I don't know
And though I live out here I know
I'm still that kid from Ohio
Still searching for something
Who still don't fucking knowEmbed
