Seal Rock Hotel LyricsAt the Seal Rock Hotel
Me and my girl havin' a bad spell
I go to the Cliff House every night
Walk to Judah Street along the oceanside
And as the ocean breaks against the seal rocks
Oh how my heart aches
And as the ocean breaks when I play guitar at night
God how my hands shake
At the Seal Rock Hotel swimming pool
Feelin' adrift, feelin' a fool
Sit around fingerfuckin' my phone
Smell the sea's salt and I go off again alone
I eat my dinner, Thanh Long
Gobbled noodles and cashew prawns
Shrimp dumplings and drunken crab
Oh how I wanna make it up with you so bad
And as the ocean breaks against the seal rocks
Oh how my heart aches
And as the ocean breaks I go to call you and
God how my hands shake
God how my hands shake
Oh the loneliest sound it makes
When the white water breaks
I wanna call you Emily
But I don't know how long it will be
At the Seal Rock Hotel lobby
Met up with my photographer friend Irene
We headed down to the Sutro Baths
She snapped my picture and we had a few laughs
And as the ocean breaks white water
Against the seal rocks my heart aches
And as the ocean breaks white water
Against the seal rocks my heart aches
And as I head off one more time to bed alone I know
It's time to come home
It's time to come home
Oh the loneliest sound it makes
When the white water breaks
I wanna come home EmilyEmbed
