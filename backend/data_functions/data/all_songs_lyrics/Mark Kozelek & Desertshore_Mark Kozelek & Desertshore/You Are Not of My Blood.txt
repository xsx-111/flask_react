You Are Not of My Blood LyricsI am not of your blood
Don't walk 'round in your mud
I never knew a son-in-law that was loved
You are not of my blood
You do not know my words
You don't fly with my birds
You do not know my spirit
You don't know what I feel
Your child's a sad old man
His life ain't amounted to nothin'
Man to man pushin 60'
Thrive on you people's pity
You are not of my blood
I am not of your kin
I don't live in your skin
So on me don't place your blame
So on me don't vent your shame
You do not know my peace
Don't know the bed I sleep in
Don't drag me in your frame
Don't care about your plague
You will not know my love
My kindness or my friendship
You will only know hardship
Suffering and sickness
You'll die a lonely death
A pillhead haggered mess
You'll die a lonely person
Your condition only worsens
You are not of my bloodEmbed
