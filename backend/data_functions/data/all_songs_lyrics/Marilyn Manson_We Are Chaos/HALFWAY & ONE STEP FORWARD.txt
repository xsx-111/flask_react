HALFWAY & ONE STEP FORWARD Lyrics
Smell your blood
It's like a carnival, or state fair
Skin is cotton candy
So easy to melt in my mouth

I don't wanna know
Don't need to know
You got champagne problems
I don't wanna know
Don't need to know
You got champagne problems

I need a raincoat for tomorrow
I need a raincoat for tomorrow
It's about how much people cry
When you die
It's not about the storm of tears
That you make when you're alive

Half-way and one step forward
Past the point of no return
Half-way and one step forward
Past the point of no return
Ring all the bells you can ring
There's a crack in everything
That's how the sunlight gets in
Ring all the bells you can ring
There's a crack in everything
That's how the sunlight gets in

I don't wanna know
Don't need to know
You got champagne problems
I don't wanna know
Don't need to know
You got champagne problems

Half-way and one step forward
Past the point of no return
Half-way and one step forward
Past the point of no return
Half-way and one step forward
Past the point of no return (I don't wanna know)

Half-way and one step forward (Don't need to know)
(You got champagne problems) Past the point of no return
(I don't wanna know, don't need to know) Half-way and one step forward
(You got champagne problems) Past the point of no return2Embed
