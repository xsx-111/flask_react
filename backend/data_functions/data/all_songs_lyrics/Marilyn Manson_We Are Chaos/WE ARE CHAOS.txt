WE ARE CHAOS Lyrics
"Some, you know, we need to find some help for you."

If you say that we're ill, give us your pill
Hope we'll just go away
But once you've inhaled death
Everything else is perfume
Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could end up your misery
Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could end up your misery
In the end, we all end up in a garbage dump
But I'll be the one that's holding your hand

We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured

Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could be your misery
Maybe I'm just a mystery
Marry with the left hand
So far, so far from the mad'ning crowd

We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
Am I a man or a show, or moment?
The man in the moon
Or a man of all seasons?
Will I be in at the kill
With you?

We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
