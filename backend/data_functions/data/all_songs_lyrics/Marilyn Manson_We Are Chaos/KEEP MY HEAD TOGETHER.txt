KEEP MY HEAD TOGETHER Lyrics
Do we get what we deserve?
Or do we deserve what we get?
Steal from the last, fuck the past
Here is your present, let's take the future
Do we get what we deserve?
Or do we deserve what we get?
Steal from the last, fuck the past
Here is your present, let's take the future

Don't try changing someone else
You'll just end up changing yourself
I keep my head together
Better keep your head together

You hand me a shovel and expect me to dig my own grave
You hand me a shovel and expect me to dig my own grave

Don't try changing someone else
You'll just end up changing yourself
I keep my head together
Better keep your head together
I fuckin' love you
I love fuckin' you
I eat glass
And I spit diamonds
I fuckin' love you
I love fuckin' you
I eat glass
And I spit diamonds
I fuckin' love you
I love fuckin' you
I eat glass
And I spit diamonds

Don't try changing someone else
You'll just end up changing yourself
I keep my head together
Better keep your head together

Keep my head together
Keep my head together
Keep my head together
