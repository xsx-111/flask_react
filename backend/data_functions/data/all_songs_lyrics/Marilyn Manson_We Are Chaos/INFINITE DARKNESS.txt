INFINITE DARKNESS Lyrics
My dirty dreams are filled with ghosts
Drowning in a shallow puddle
My muck and mud is thicker than the quickest of my demons

Fast and ghastly
Fast and ghastly
Fast and ghastly
And unforgiving

Someone's gonna die soon
Don't get in the way
You're not the hero
You're not the hero

You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive

First class on the astral plane
Just 'cause you're famous doesn't mean you're worth anything
In this world or the next one or the one before
'Cause I'm not forgiving
Not forgiving (Said I'm not forgiving)
Not forgiving (Said I'm not forgiving)
I'm fast and ghastly (Fast and ghastly)

Someone's gonna die soon
Don't get in the way
You're not the hero
Not the hero

You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive

Black is real, you can't hide
Hearts are the darkest
When you see without the sun
Black is real, you can't hide
Hearts are the darkest
When you see without the sun
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead

Black is real, you can't hide
Hearts are the darkest
When you see without the sun
Black is real, you can't hide
Hearts are the darkest
When you see without the sun

You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead longer than you're alive
You're dead3Embed
