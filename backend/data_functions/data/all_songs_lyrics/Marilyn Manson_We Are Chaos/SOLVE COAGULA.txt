SOLVE COAGULA Lyrics
You are the one
Tore off both your arms
Gouged out your eyes
And ripped out your own tongue
So listen

I'm not special, I'm just broken
And I don't wanna be fixed

No one else I
No one else I
Wanna be like
So I stayed the same
Like nobody else

So you think you can sing or clap
Well, all you need is an ear
So listen

I'm not special, I'm just broken
And I don't wanna be fixed
No one else I
No one else I
Wanna be like
So I stayed the same
Like nobody else
No one else I
No one else I
Wanna be like
So I stayed the same
Like nobody else


No one else I
No one else I
Wanna be like
So I stayed the same
Like nobody else
No one else I
No one else I
Wanna be like
So I stayed the same
Like nobody else
I'm not special, I'm just
Broken and I don't wanna be fixed
I'm not special, I'm just
Broken and I don't wanna be fixed
I'm not special, I'm just
Broken and I don't wanna be fixed
I'm not special, I'm just
Broken and I don't wanna be fixed
I'm not special, I'm just
Broken and I don't wanna be fixed1Embed
