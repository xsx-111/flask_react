RED BLACK AND BLUE Lyrics
I can stick a needle in the horror and fix your blindness
(Your blindness, see I)
See, I was a snake
But I didn't realize that you could walk on water (I didn’t)
Without legs
(Walk on water without legs)
Now I'm a bee, the king bee
And I will destroy every flower (I will destroy every flower)
And I will cover the earth in honey (Cover the earth in honey)
And everyone will eat themselves
(And everyone will eat themselves)
My eyes are mirrors
All I can see are gods on the left
And demons on the right

Set fire to the tree of life
Not for death
Just to watch the suffering
Get high on the smoke and dance
In the ashes

This arrangement is deranged
Imagine us engaged in flames
This arrangement is deranged
Imagine us engaged in flames
Red, black and I'm blue
Red, black and I’m blue
Red, black and I'm blue
Red
Black
And I'm blue

Am I garbage or God?
Am I garbage or God?
Church or a trashcan?
Either way you're a waste of my time

This arrangement is deranged (Deranged)
Imagine us engaged in flames
This arrangement is deranged
Imagine us engaged in flames

Heroes destroy
Murder without a choice
Just linear fucking lines

('Cause I'm) Red, black and I'm blue
Red, black and I'm blue
Am I garbage or God?
Am I garbage or God?
Church or a trashcan?
Either way you’re a waste of my time
Am I garbage or God?
Am I garbage or God?
Church or a trashcan?
Either way you’re a waste of my time

Red, black and I'm blue

Sick-sick-sick of you
And all your attitudes
And I’m sick-sick-sick of you
Sick-sick-sick of you
And all your attitudes
And I'm sick from you
And I'm sick from you

'Cause I’m red, black, blue
(Am I garbage or God? Am I garbage or God?)
(Church or a trashcan?)
I'm red, black and I'm blue
(Either way you're a waste of my time)
I'm red, black and I'm blue
(Am I garbage or God? Am I garbage or God?)
(Church or a trashcan?)
I'm red, black and I'm blue
(Either way you're a waste of my time)
I'm red, black and I'm blue10Embed
