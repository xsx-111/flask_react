Mountain Woman (Bonus Track) LyricsThey lived together in a dirty old shack
At the edge of the black rocky mountain
And they drank mountain dew and they lived on the food
That they grew at the side of the mountain
She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Lived all their lives by the valley
She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Uneducated but they're happy
Mountain woman couldn't read nor write
But she knew good from evil, she know wrong from right
When the government tried to buy her water rights
Her intuition was her only guide
She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Lived all their lives by the valley
She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Uneducated but they're happy
Spend my life with my mountain woman
We're uneducated by we're happy
The civil servant used compulsory purchase
To acquire the valley for the nation
They'll dig up the land, they're gonna make a dam
And build a hydroelectric power station
And now she lives on the 33rd floor
Of a man-made concrete mountain
She got an elevator and refrigerator
And an automobile to run around in
Fast talkin' lawyers from the government
Wouldn't beat proud mountain woman down
Hey mountain woman, take your mountain man
They took your land and flood your valley
Spend my life with my mountain woman
They're uneducated by they're happyEmbed
