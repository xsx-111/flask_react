Here Come the People in Grey Lyrics
I got a letter this morning with some serious news
That's gone and ruined my day
The borough surveyor's used compulsory purchase
To acquire my domain
They're gonna pull up the floors
They're gonna knock down the walls
They're gonna dig up the drains

Here come the people in grey
They're gonna take me away to Lord knows only where
But I'm so unprepared
I got no time to pack and I've got nothing to wear
Here come the people in grey
To take me away

Me and my baby gonna get on a train
That's gonna take us away
We're gonna live in a tent
We're gonna pay no more rent
We're gonna pay no more rates
We're gonna live in a field
We're gonna buy me a gun to keep the policemen away
I'm gonna pass me a brand new resolution
I'm gonna fight me a one man revolution, some way
Gonna beat those people in grey
But here come the people in grey
To take me away

Here come the people in grey
To take me away

The people in grey have gone and taken away
My right to voice my complaint
Her Majesty's Government have sent me a form
I must complete it today
But it's making me blue
Don't wanna tell all my secrets to
The people in grey

Gonna pass me a brand new resolution
Gonna fight me a one man revolution, some way
Gonna start my rebellion today
But here come the people in grey
To take me away
Oh, Lord, those people in grey
I gotta get back at those people in grey
Here come the people in grey
To take me awayEmbed
