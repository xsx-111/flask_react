Free Baby LyricsHey baby -would you stop those stupid games
That you are playing
Hey baby is it lies or is it true
What they are saying
When you're on your own you play around
Set me free
Hey baby is IT mine or someone else's bed
You're sleep tonight
Tell me baby, if it's someone else, make sure
That he will treat you right
When you're on your own you play around
Set me free
Hey baby is IT mine or someone else's bed
You're sleep tonight
Tell me baby, if it's someone else, make sure
That he will treat you right
When you're on your own you play around
Set me freeEmbed
