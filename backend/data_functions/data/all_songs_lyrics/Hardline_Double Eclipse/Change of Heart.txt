Change of Heart LyricsI can feel the time is slippin'
When there is nothing I can do to get through to you
Night after night, fight after fight
Is every inch of hope gone or is it hiding in you?
(Oh, yeah)
Through the laughter, there's always been pain
There's only heartache and no one's to blame
I feel that change of heart
Burning inside me, it tears us apart
I feel that change of heart
Not a word that you can say
Could change yesterday, yeah
Sometimes words don't come out easy
Though we try and try again, the hurt never ends (oh, no)
Maybe we'll learn to love tomorrow
It's my heart I've got to follow more faithfully
I can't stay another day
I've been living a lie in hope
And I'm prayin' there's a way
I feel that change of heart
Burning inside me, it tears us apart
I feel that change of heart
Not a word that you can say
Could change yesterday, yeah
You know we have tried
I have nothing to hide
There's no you and I
Yeah, stop talkin' 'bout love
You're everything I wanted
You're everything that I need
Well, I feel that change of heart
Burning inside me, it tears us apart
(Yes, it does)
I feel that change of heart
Not a word, a word you can say
Could change yesterday, yeah
I feel that change of heart
I know my heart wants to change, change
Oh, I feel my change of heart
Burning inside me tears us apart
I feel that change of heart
Burning inside me, it tears us apart
I feel that change of heart
Not a word that you can say
Could change yesterday, yeah
I feel that change of heart
Burning inside me, it tears us apartEmbed
