Love Leads the Way LyricsI need to reach out and make you understand
I'm not just a lonely heart in the palm of your hand
Can you feel it, baby? You take my breath away
Each night I hold you, girl, the world has no time
Is love a chance of fate? Is my heart on the line?
I was a blind man, well, now you're all that I see
Well, I've been waiting for you all of my life
This feeling inside is too strong to fight
One look in your eyes and I know it's a fact
This time it's forever, there's no turning back
When love leads the way
Two hearts never stray
We're one, night and day
When love, baby
When love leads the way
I feel you tremble with every touch of your hand
You wanna run away, well, run if you can
From this feeling, but you won't get very far
Oh, yeah
'Cause, baby, tonight
This love that we found
Will take us to heaven
We'll never come down
When love leads the way
Two hearts never stray
We're one, night and day
When love, baby
When love leads the way
If we follow our hearts
Day after day
Our love will know the way
When love leads the way
(When love leads the way)
Two hearts never stray
(Two hearts never stray)
We're one, night and day
(We're one, night and day)
When love leads the way
When love leads the way
Two hearts never stray
We're one, night and day
When love, baby
When love leads the way
When love leads the way
(When love leads the way)
Two hearts never stray
(Two hearts never stray)
We're one, night and day
When love leads the wayEmbed
