Hot Cherie Lyrics
Been too long since the last rain
Still the stars sizzle hot in the sky
And there, undressed in the shadows
Stands my sweet Cherie hiding from July

And all night
You kept me up, up all night
Hopin' that I could make you mine

You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
Isn't my love strong enough?
I'm ready to rock you long and rough
You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
I'm goin' crazy, yeah

I can't wait for October
When the breeze from the lake, she's blowin' cold
Well, maybe she'll need me for some shelter
When the campfire dies and the tall tales have been told, yeah
And all night
I've been workin' overtime
Hopin' that I could make you mine

You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
Isn't my love strong enough?
I'm ready to rock you long and rough
You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
I'm goin' crazy

And all night
I've been workin' overtime
Hopin' that I could make you mine

You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
Isn't my love strong enough?
I'm ready to rock you long and rough
You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
Isn't my love strong enough?
I'm ready to rock you long and rough
You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
Cherie (Cherie, yeah)
You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
(You're gettin' me hot, baby, Cherie)
Isn't my love strong enough?
I'm ready to rock you long and rough
You're gettin' me hot, CherieEmbed
