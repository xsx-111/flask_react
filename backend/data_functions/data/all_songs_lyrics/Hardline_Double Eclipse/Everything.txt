Everything LyricsWell, we've come this far
It should last forever
Something here so strong
It's holding us together
Everything I do, well, I do for you
I didn't mean to let you down
And if I lose control, somehow you'll always know
That I'll come back around
I've got this feeling, I can't shake it, all right
Hey, baby, hey, baby
Can't let you walk away
'Cause you're everything I want
You got everything I need
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
You're everything to me
Like a shot to my heart
Girl, you keep me goin'
Everything you touch, girl, you give so much
My love is overflowin', yeah
I got this fever, I can't break it, all right
Hey, baby, hey, baby
Now don't you walk away
'Cause you're everything I want
You got everything I need
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
You're everything to me
There's a message in your eyes
That keeps tellin' me you're mine
I know you wanna stay, can't let you slip away
You're everything, yeah, oh, yes, you are
You got this hold on me
It's stronger every day
You're the heart that beats in me
Can't let you walk away
Yeah
Hey, baby
Yeah
All right
'Cause you're everything I want
You got everything I need
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
You're everything to me
And there's a message in your eyes
That keeps tellin' me you're mine
I know you wanna stay, can't let you slip away
You're everything, yeah
'Cause you're everything I want
You got everything I need
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
You're everything to me
There's a message in your eyes
That keeps tellin' me you're mine
I know you wanna stay, can't let you slip away
You're everything, yeah
'Cause you're everything I want
You got everything I needEmbed
