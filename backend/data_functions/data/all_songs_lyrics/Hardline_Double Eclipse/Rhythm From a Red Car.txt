Rhythm From a Red Car LyricsHit like lightnin'
And my head started spinnin' around
Caught in the shuffle
On the corner of lost and found, yeah
Well, the way that she drove by me
Didn't need to say a word
Well, her lips did all the talkin'
And not a sound was ever heard, yeah
Brake, baby, won't you tell me what's on your mind?
Yeah
She threw me rhythm from a red car
She threw me rhythm from a red car
Yeah
Here we go, baby
Takin' a turn for the better
I'll work your curves, girl
Let the road run on forever
Now you're lookin' good in my mirror
Then you blind me with your lights
Well, you're drivin' me crazy
On this road to paradise, yeah
Brake, baby, won't you tell me what's on your mind?
Oh, yeah
She threw me rhythm from a red car
She threw me rhythm from a red car
(In your eyes I see and they're tellin' me I should follow you)
She threw me rhythm from a red car
She threw me rhythm from a red car
(In your eyes I see and they're tellin' me that you want it you)
Rhythm from a red car
She threw me rhythm from a red car
(In your eyes I see and they're tellin' me I should follow you)
She threw me rhythm from a red car
She threw me rhythm from a red car
(In your eyes I see and they're tellin' me that you want it you)
She threw me rhythm
