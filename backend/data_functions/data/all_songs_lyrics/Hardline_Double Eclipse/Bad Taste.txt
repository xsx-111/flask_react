Bad Taste LyricsShe comes on like a freight train
Tearin' up the tracks again
She'll shift it hard into high gear
To get away from where she's been
And I heard her comin' from a mile away
Yeah, I felt the ground shake
If you wanna ride her, put coal into her fire
Man, that's your first mistake
Well, you're smooth like silk
But you spoil like milk
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You leave a bad taste, honey
Such a bad, bad taste
Such a sad case, honey
Oh, leavin' me with this bad, bad taste
Only comes around when there's somethin' goin' down
Fast cars and cigarette boats
Speed with a lot of noise
Well, I could not believe that news, girl
You've been playin' with another man's toys
Now who's gonna be the lucky one
Who will feed your hungry hands
When you're climbin' real high on the money tree, honey?
Shake it, shake it, girl, like you did to me, yeah
Smooth like silk
But you spoil like milk
Yeah, yeah, yes, you do
You leave a bad taste, honey
Such a bad, bad, bad taste
Such a sad case, honey
Ooh, leavin' me with this bad taste
Such a bad taste, honey
Bad, bad taste
Such a sad case, honey
She's leavin' me, leavin' me
She leaves a bad taste
You leave a bad taste, honey
Such a bad, bad, bad taste
Such a sad case, honey
Ooh, leavin' me with this bad taste
Such a bad taste, honey
You're leavin' me with a bad, bad, bad taste
Such a bad, bad, bad, bad tasteEmbed
