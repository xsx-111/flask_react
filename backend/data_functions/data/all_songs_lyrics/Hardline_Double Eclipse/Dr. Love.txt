Dr. Love LyricsYeah, yeah
In the middle of a deep, dark night
Your body's soaked in sweat
Well, outside it's cold as ice
But you're burning up the bed
You've got a nasty little fever and it's climbin' up high
Nothin' you can do to stop the aching inside
I can relieve you, you know that I could
You've got it bad, baby, I'll make it good
Hang on to Dr. Love
I know what you need
Baby, just call me
Hang on to Dr. Love
My love will set you free
(Just for one night, gonna make it all right)
Your pretty head in spinnin' 'round
Your heart beats out of time
I'm gonna wear your body down
With what's been on your mind
You've got a dirty little secret and it's killing you slow
Nothin' you can do to cool the fire down below
I can relieve you with a touch of my hands
I'll feed the fever, baby, I am your man
Hang on to Dr. Love
(Call the doctor)
I know what you need
Baby, just call me
Hang on to Dr. Love
(Somebody call the doctor)
My love will set you free
Time is the healer, so they say
Don't you believe you can wait
You need me right away
The night is dark, as dark as shame
But I will heal you, treat your pain
Until you call my name
Hang on to Dr. Love
(Call the doctor)
I know what you need
Baby, just call me
Hang on to Dr. Love
(Somebody call the doctor)
My love will set you free (set you free)
Hang on to Dr. Love
(Call the doctor)
I know what you need
Well, baby, just call me
Hang on to Dr. Love
(Somebody call the doctor)
My love will set you free, yeah
All right, yeah
You know what I'm talkin' about, don't you?
Call the doctor
All rightEmbed
