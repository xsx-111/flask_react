In the Hands of Time LyricsAll right
Oh, yeah
Living every moment holding on to a dream
Staring at an empty page, will it come to me?
And I wonder, will the light ever shine on me?
If it's a mountain I must climb, then that's the way it must be
Day after day, like a lifetime away, I keep holding on
And night after night, out of reach, out of sight from it all
Day after day, I won't walk away from this dream of mine
Whoa, yeah, it's in the hands of time
Live every moment with a dream burning bright
And never stop reachin' when the dream shines its light
Will I take it for granted when the trying's all said and done?
Does the pain of rememberin' fade when dreams are won?
Day after day, fight the storm's shade of gray and keep holdin' on
Night after night, let hope be your light on your way
Day after day, I won't walk away from this dream of mine
Whoa, yeah, it's in the hands of time
Day after day like a lifetime away, keep holding on
Night after night, let hope be your light on your way
Day after day, I won't walk away from this dream of mine
Whoa, yeah, it's in the hands of timeEmbed
