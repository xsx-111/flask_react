Mote Lyrics
When you feel the spiral turning for you alone
And you feel so heavy that you just can't stop it
When this sea of madness turns you into stone
Picture of your life shoots like a rocket
All the time

Put 'me' in the equation it's alright
I've seen you moving in and out of sight
My friends tell me it's all cut through you
From nowhere to nowhere
Cut together, cutting through

I'm island-bound, a mote inside my eye
And I can't see you breathing as before
I am airlessâ€“a vacuum child
And I can't stand to reason at your door
In this time

Put 'me' in the equation it's alright
I've seen you moving in and out of sight
My friends tell me it'll all cut through you
From nowhere to nowhere
Cut together
I'm down in the daytime out of sight
Coming in from dreamland I'm on fire
I can see it's all been here before
Dream a dream that lies right at your door

When the seasons circle sideways out of turn
And words don't speak just fall across the carpet
You're just in time to watch the fires burn
It seems a crime but your face is bright you love it
All the time
