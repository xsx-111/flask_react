Mary-Christ Lyrics
Talking to a punker priest
Just dodging the breeze
About being a tree
(He says it's free now)
Along comes Mary Christ
Skating light on ice
And says, 'let's go on high'
(Later, priestoid)
Gotta go
I got a date now
Yeah I know
Shall not be late now
Possessed by x-ray eyes
Her spirit spy's
Into my lies
(Let's burn 'em out now)
Wraps my head in skin
Says now I'm in
Dig the candy sin
(Yeah, spit it out now)
Everytime
She sings that low song
Everytime
I know she's right, wrong
Angel in a devil skirt
Buys me a shirt
Says I hope you like
(I like what now?)
Hope, I hope you like
Like you like your hope
Walk the tightest rope
(I see, I know now)
Here we go
Been waiting so long
Yeah I know
For Mary to come along
Talking to a punker priest
Just dodging the breeze
About being a tree
(He says it's free now)
Along comes Mary Christ
Skating light on ice
And says, 'let's go on high'
(Later, priestoid)
Gotta go
I got a date now
Yeah I know
Shall not be late now
Possessed by x-ray eyes
Her spirit spy's
Into my lies
(Let's burn 'em out now)
Angel in a devil skirt
Buys me a shirt
Says I hope you like
(Yeah, spit it out now)
Here we go
Been waiting so long
Yeah I know
For Mary to come alongEmbed
