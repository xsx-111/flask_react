Just The Motion LyricsWhen you're rocked on the ocean, rocked up and down, don't worry
When you're spinning and turning 'round and around, don't worry
You're just feeling sea-sick, you're just feeling weak
Your mind is confused and you can't seem to speak
It's just the motion
It's just the motion
When the landlord is knocking and your job is losing, don't worry
And the baby needs rocking and your friends are confusing, don't worry
You're just feeling sea-sick, you're just feeling weak
Your mind is confused and you can't seem to speak
Oh, it's just the motion, it's just the motion
Blown by a hundred winds, knocked down a hundred times
Rescued and carried along. Beaten and half-dead and gone
And it's only the pain that's keeping you sane
And gives you a mind to travel on
Oh the motion won't leave you, won't let you remain, don't worry
It's a restless wind and a sleepless rain, don't worry
'Cause under the ocean at the bottom of the sea
You can't hear the storm, it's as peaceful as can be
It's just the motion, it's just the motion
Blown by a hundred winds, knocked down a hundred times
Rescued and carried along
Beaten and half-dead and gone
And it's only the pain that's keeping you sane
And gives you a mind to travel on
Oh, the motion won't leave you, won't let you remain, don't worry
It's a restless wind and a sleepless rain, don't worry
'Cause under the ocean at the bottom of the sea
You can't hear the storm, it's as peaceful as can be
It's just the motion, it's just the motion
It's just the motion, it's just the motionEmbed
