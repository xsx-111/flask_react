Wall of Death Lyrics
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
You can waste your time on the other rides
This is the nearest to being alive
Oh let me take my chances on the wall of death

You can go with the crazy people in the crooked house
You can fly away on the rocket or spin in the mouse
The tunnel of love might amuse you
And Noah's Ark might confuse you but
Let me take my chances on the wall of death

On the wall of death
All the world is far from me
On the wall of death
It's the nearest to being free

Well you're going nowhere when you ride on the carousel
And maybe you're strong, but what's the good of ringing a bell?
The switchback will make you crazy
Beware of the bearded lady
Oh let me take my chances on the wall of death
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
You can waste your time on the other rides
But this is the nearest to being alive
Oh let me take my chances on the wall of death

(Let me take my chances on the wall of death)
Let me take my chances on the wall of death
(Let me take my chances on the wall of death)
Let me take my chances on the wall of deathEmbed
