A Man In Need LyricsI packed my rags, went down the hill
Left my dependents a-lying still
Just as the dawn was rising up
I was making good speed
I left a letter lying on the bed
From a man in need, it read
You know it's so hard, It's so hard to find
Well, well, well. Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?
All of my friends don't comprehend me
Their kind of style it just offends me
I want to take 'em, I want to shake 'em
'Till they pay me some heed
Oh, you've got to ride in one direction
Until you find the right connection
You know it's so hard, so, so, so, so
Well, well. Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?
Who's going to give you real happiness?
Who's going to give you contentedness?
Who's going to lead you? Who's going to feed you?
And cut you free?
Well I've sailed every ship in the sea
But I travelled this world in misery
You know it's so hard, so hard, so hard
Well, well. Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?
Well who's going to shoe your feet?
Ah who's going to pay your rent?
And who's going to stand by you?
Well, well, well, well
Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Of a man in needEmbed
