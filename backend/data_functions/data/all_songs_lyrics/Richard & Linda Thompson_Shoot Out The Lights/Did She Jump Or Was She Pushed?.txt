Did She Jump Or Was She Pushed? Lyrics
She was there one minute
And then she was gone the next
Lying in a pool of herself
With a twisted neck
Oh she fell from the roof to the ground
There was glass lying all around
She was broken in a hundred pieces
When her body was found

She used to live life
She used to live life with a vengeance
And the chosen would dance
The chosen would dance in attendance
She crossed a lot of people
Some she called friends
She thought she'd live forever
But forever always ends

Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?

Oh, she used to have style
She used to have style and she used it
And they say it turned bad
When the truth came 'round and she refused it
They found some fingerprints
Right around her throat
They didn't find no killer
And they didn't find no note
Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?
Oh, did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?Embed
