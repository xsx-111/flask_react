4 Ever 2 Gether LyricsYou can tell me how to run my life
You can tell me the drugs you're using
You're talking loud and saying nothing
Walking proud and going nowhere fast
You know
If you could tell me how to find belief
If you told me, I'd believe you
Speak no evil, hear no evil, see no evil
I'll close my eyes, you know love grows
4 ever 2 gether, 4 years 2 come
4 love 2 strong, 4 us 2 part
4 ever 2 gether, 4 years 2 come
4 love 2 strong, 4 us 2 part
I stuck a marriage proposal in the waste disposal
If that's the trash aesthetic, I'd suggest that we forget it
Your 12 disciples might kiss and tell
But you can tell me much more than they can
Right now
A mathematical equation won't describe my liaison
The stars in the sky might try persuading
But you can tell me, I won't hear you
You can tell me, I gave up the listening
Years ago
4 ever 2 gether, 4 years 2 come
4 love 2 strong, 4 us 2 part
4 ever 2 gether, 4 years 2 come
4 love 2 strong, 4 us 2 part
So you're broken hearted, take it to the mender
I got something on the agenda
Speak no, speak no, speak no evil
4 ever 2 gether, 4 years 2 come
4 love 2 strong, 4 us 2 part
For when two hearts but strong and sweet
One promise I can never meet
Forgive and forget, for goodness sake
For love this strong, might make or break
4 ever 2 gether, 4 years 2 come
4 love 2 strong, 4 us 2 part
Two's a party, three's a crowd
I'm surprised what get's allowed
Three coins inside the fountain
You saw Mohammed move the mountain
Speak no evil
Speak no evil
This is silly, well nearly
Yours faithfully, well eventually
Speak no evil
Speak no evilEmbed
