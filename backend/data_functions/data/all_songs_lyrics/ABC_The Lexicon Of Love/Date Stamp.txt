Date Stamp LyricsThis heart's up for sale
Yeah, this heart's on the stand
Mix and match and melt in my mouth
Nothing ever goes quite as planned
You'll fly north and I'll sail south
So redevelop product, redesign this package
Still refuse to reach in your pocket
Everything is temporary written on that sand
Looking for the girl that meets supply with demand
Love has no guarantee (Yes, I'm date stamped)
Promise of eternity (Guess I'll fade away)
Even with a pedigree (Yes, I'm date stamped)
Love has no guarantee
That heart's on display
Yes, that heart's off the rails
A ship in the harbor with wind in it's sails
Chain up love inside the chain-store girl
Chain up love and exchange it
Is monsieur a connoisseur or just short-changed
Off the rack or custom-fit it all seems the same
Look but don't touch in paradise
Don't let them catch you damaging the merchandise
Love has no guarantee (Yes, I'm date stamped)
Promise of eternity (Guess I'll fade away)
Even with a pedigree (Yes, I'm date stamped)
Love has no guarantee
I get sales talk from sales assistants
When all I want to do girl is lower your resistance
Everything is temporary, written on that sand
Looking for the girl that meets supply with demand
Love has no guarantee, brings out the woman in me
Even with a pedigree, love has no guarantee
No chance of certainty, no promise of eternity
Even with a pedigree, love has no guaranteeEmbed
