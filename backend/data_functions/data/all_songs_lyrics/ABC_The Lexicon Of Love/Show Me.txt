Show Me LyricsOnce I needed your love
But that was just one thing left on my mind
Then I needed to feel you near me
You said:"Don't have the time."
The cowboys at the rodeo
The rhine-stones on that Romeo
Your theme tune on the radio
Souvenirs that only go to
Show me, show me
Show me that your mine
Show me, show me
Give me just one sign
Show me, show me
Second that emotion
Show me, show me love
Since we're skimming the surface darling
Now's time to get in deep
You've opened up the envelope
But there's still one secret you keep
A pirate station or the late night show
A sunken ship with a rich cargo
Buried treasure that the four winds blow
Wind and rain it only goes to
Show me, show me
Show me that your mine
Show me, show me
Give me just one sign
Show me, show me
Second that emotion
Show me, show me love
Some things are hidden
Some things you'll see
Make me know
Signal to me
Nine out of ten, in every case
She might look pretty but there's make up on her face
Show me, show me love
And you can be free
And you could be free. Free. Free
Where are the diamonds?
Where are the curls?
Where are the things that you took from this world?
These are the diamonds
These are the curls
These are the things that you took from this worldEmbed
