Fireplace Lyrics
Crazy, crazy world
Crazy, crazy times
Crazy, crazy world
Crazy, crazy times

Hang up your chairs to better sweep
Clear the floor to dance
Shake the rug into the fireplace

Crazy, crazy world
Crazy, crazy times
Crazy, crazy world
Crazy, crazy times

Hang up your chairs to better sweep
Clear the floor to dance
Sweep the floor into the fireplace

Hang up your chairs to better sweep
Clear the floor to dance
Throw the chairs into the fireplace
Hang up your chairs to better sweep
Clear the floor to dance
Throw the walls into the fireplace1Embed
