Finest Worksong Lyrics
The time to rise has been engaged
You'd better best to rearrange
I'm talking here to me alone
I listen to the finest worksong

Your finest hour
Your finest hour

Another chance has been engaged
To throw Thoreau and rearrange
You are following this time
I beg you not beg to rhyme

(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour

Take your instinct by the reins
You'd better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused
(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour

Take your instinct by the reins
Better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused

(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour

(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hourEmbed
