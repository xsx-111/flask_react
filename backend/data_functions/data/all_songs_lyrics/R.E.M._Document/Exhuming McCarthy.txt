Exhuming McCarthy Lyrics
You're beautiful, more beautiful than me
You're honorable, more honorable than me
Loyal to the Bank of America

It's a sign of the times
It's a sign of the times

You're sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen
Sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen

Vested interest, united ties
Landed gentry, rationalize
Look who bought the myth
By Jingo, buy America

It's a sign of the times
It's a sign of the times

You're sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen
Sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen
Enemy sighted, enemy met
I'm addressing the realpolitik
Look who bought the myth
By Jingo, buy America

"Let us not assassinate this man further
Senator, you've done enough
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"

(It's a sign of the times)
(It's a sign of the times)

You're sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen
Sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen

Enemy sighted, enemy met
I'm addressing the realpolitik
You've seen start and you've seen quit (I'm addressing the table of content)
I always thought of you as quick
Exhuming McCarthy (Meet me at the book burning)
(Meet me at the book burning)
Exhuming McCarthy (Meet me at the book burning)
Exhuming McCarthy (Meet me at the book burning)
(Meet me at the book burning)
Exhuming McCarthy (Meet me at the book burning)1Embed
