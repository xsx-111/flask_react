King of Birds Lyrics
A thumbnail sketch, a jeweler's stone
A mean idea to call my own
Old man don't lay so still you're not yet young
There's time to teach, point to point
Point observation, children carry reservations

Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold
Leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly

Singer sing me a given
Singer sing me a song
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Everybody's looking on

Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold
Leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly
Away
Away

I am king of all I see
My kingdom for a voice
Old man don't lay so still, you're not yet young
There's time to teach, point to point
Point observation, children carry reservations

Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold
Leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly

Away
Away

Everybody hit the ground
Everybody hit the ground
Everybody hit the ground1Embed
