Strange Lyrics
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Michael's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right

There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh-huh

There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Michael's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right

There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's gonna save your life
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh-huh

There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's gonna save your life
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh-huh1Embed
