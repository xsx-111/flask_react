Blind Love LyricsPeople, I was standing at my window
Tears running all down my cheeks
Yes, standing at my window
Tears running all down my cheeks
Well, I could see the woman I'm loving
Stopping everyone in the world she meets
Well, standing on the corner
Between 35th and Main
Well, standing on the corner, people
Between 35th and Main
Yeah, that's where a blind man's seen my woman
People, a dumb man called her name
He said, "Oh, I'm blind
You brought eyesight and made me see"
"Oh, I'm blind
You brought eyesight and made me see"
Yes, and the dumb man asked a question
"Woman, who may your good man be?"
Yes, I'm standing by trembling, people
People, my heart's laying in my hand
I'm standing by trembling, darling
With my heart's laying in my hand
Well, I could hear my baby say
"Lord, I ain't got no man"Embed
