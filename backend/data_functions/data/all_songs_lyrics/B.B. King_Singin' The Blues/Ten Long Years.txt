Ten Long Years LyricsWell I had a woman
She was nice, kind and loving to me in every way
Oh I had a woman
She was nice, kind and loving to me in every way
Oh she used to love me
And bring my breakfast to my bed every day
For ten long years
She was my pride and joy
Oh for ten long years
She was my pride and joy
And I used to call her my little girl
Oh she used to call me
She used to call me her little boy
Oh it's all over baby
You know I'm all alone
It's all over baby
Damn you know I'm all alone
Well the reason you hear me singing the blues baby
Yeah you know my baby's gone
She's gone she's goneEmbed
