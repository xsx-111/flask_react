Big Takeover LyricsNo one dared to show for that shower
When nobody turned out to be clean
Was not even touched by the water
Just another Nazi scheme
Yeah, the big takeover yeah-ah-
My, big takeover yeahh, yeahhh
All throughout this so called nation
Prepare yourself for the final quest
This world is doomed with its desegregation
Just another Nazi test
Yeah, the big takeover yeah
My, big takeover yeah, yeah
So understand me when I say
There's no hope for the USA
This world is doomed with its desegregation
Just another Nazi test
Yeah, the big takeover yeah
My, big takeover yeah, yeah3Embed
