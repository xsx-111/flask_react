Leaving Babylon LyricsWell I say
Say I'm leaving this babylon
I'm leaving this babylon
It will not be too long now
It will not be too long
I said my people are starvin'
But your money's runnin'
I said my people are starvin'
But your money's runnin'
I say your dollar, dollar drop down real low
And you ain't got no gold to show
We gonna step right through that door
We not gonna come back no more
I said the politician lyin'
Momma just a cryin'
And nothing ever gonna change
My poppa just a sighin'
My sister just a lyin'
And I ainâ€™t nothing to say
Well I say
Well I sayEmbed
