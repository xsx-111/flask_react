Fearless Vampire Killers LyricsThe bourgeoisie had better watch out for me
All throughout this so called nation
We don't want your filthy money
We don't need your innocent bloodshed
We just wanna end your world
Well my mind's made up
Yes it's time for you to pay
Better watch out for me
I'm a member of the F. V. K2Embed
