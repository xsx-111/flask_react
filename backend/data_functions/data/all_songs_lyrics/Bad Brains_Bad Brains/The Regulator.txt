The Regulator LyricsYou tell me what to say and when to say it
You tell me what to do and how to do it
And if I ask you why, you'll arrest me
And if I call you liar, you'll detest me
You control what I'll be
You control who I see
And if I let you...
You'll control me
You're the man who owns all the keys to the stores
You're the man who always wants so much more
You're the Regulator
You're the Regulator
You're the Regulator
You're the RegulatorEmbed
