I LyricsNot as much but with such intensity
I'd like to be what they would not want me to be
I like to cram their chivalry inside their guts
I'd like to leave it all behind with the rest of the nuts
I, oh
Not as much but with more feeling now
I'd like to forget about you and try to break it somehow
I'd like to push it aside until I can see some more
I'd like to leave you where I found you lying on the floor
I, oh

I guess it's too bad, I guess its too bad
I guess it's too bad, too bad
For you!
It seems the truth always prevails on your face
And in the end I see what's in its place
So in the future you just may see
That's what you'll receive is what you gave to me
I, oh, oh1Embed
