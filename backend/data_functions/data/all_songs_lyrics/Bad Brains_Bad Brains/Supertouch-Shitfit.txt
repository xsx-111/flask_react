Supertouch/Shitfit Lyrics
Some people look at me and talk about me like a clown
They just don't realize it's just my simple way to get down
I've got that supertouch, chances are I've got too much
I've come to let you see, that you also can be free
It seems that every time we all try to go underground
The stinking troopers them they think that we are fooling around
We have had about enough, now we're gonna get real tough
It happens everyday, that's why we got P.M.A
We have had about enough, now we're gonna get real tough
It happens everyday, we got supertouch

People just pretending, that's a let down
Undercover lover, that's my heart now
Struggle just in living, that's the realm of
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfit
My best, ain't good enough for you
My test, is what you gonna do
Ain't no, any kind of way
Love was, lost in yesterday
Now we've, felt this
So you'll, get yours now
Everybody's living
And nobody's giving
And nobody gives a damn
You must understand me
The end is surely coming
Prepare for the final plan
People just pretending, that's a let down
Undercover lover, that's my heart now
Struggle just in living, that's the realm of
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfitEmbed
