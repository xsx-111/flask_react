I Luv I Jah LyricsI love, I love, I Jah
I love, I love, I Jah
I love, I love, I Jah

Walking down Babylon Lane
Me trying to live my life in peace
Two young men call me not their brother
They try to make I feel ashamed

But I love, I Jah, yeah
He tell me not to be that way
I love, I Jah, yeah
I gotta keep my PMA
I love, I love, I Jah
I love, I love, I Jah
I love, I love, I Jah

My lovely sister judge me by my clothes, yeah
Only to learn to her mistake, not everyone's alike
We're not all a uptight, ah, no fuss, no fight
Cool that way, let me tell you 'bout the cool that way
