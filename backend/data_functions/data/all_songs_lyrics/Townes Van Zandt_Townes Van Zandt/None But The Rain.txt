None But The Rain Lyrics
We had our day, but now it's over
We had our song, but now it's sung
We had our stroll through summer's clover
But summer's gone now, our walkin' is done

So tell me gently who'll be your lover?
Who'll be your lover after I'm gone?
Will it be the moon that hears your sighin'?
Will it be the willow that hears your lonesome song?

Will it be the rain that clings to your bosom?
Will it be the sunshine that dries your golden hair?
Will it be the wind that warns of my returning?
Will a rose be in your arms when I find you waitin' there?

None but the rain shall cling to my bosom
None but the moon shall hear my lonesome sigh
None but the wind shall warn of your returning
Fare thee well, my love, goodbyeEmbed
