Columbine Lyrics
Tossin' hair raven
Eyes of flashin' blue
All the livin' that you're savin'
Won't buy your dreams for you

Cut yourself a columbine
Tear it from the stem
Now breathe upon the petals fine
And throw 'em to the wind

Watch the petals dancing
See 'em twirl and sing
Now all your pride and prancing
How much does it mean?

Watch the petals start to fly
And then come falling down
Ah hear the wind begin to cry
As she sees 'em touch the ground

Ah, lady, like the flower fair
Some day you'll have to fall
And you can find me standin' there
To catch you if you call
Tossin' hair raven
Eyes of flashin' blue
All the livin' that you're savin'
Won't buy your dreams for youEmbed
