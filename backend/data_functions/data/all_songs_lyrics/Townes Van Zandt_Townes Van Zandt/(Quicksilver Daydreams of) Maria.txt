(Quicksilver Daydreams of) Maria Lyrics
Well, the diamond fades quickly when matched to the face of Maria
All the harps, they sound empty when she lifts her lips to the sky
All the brown of her skin makes her hair seem a soft golden rainfall
That spills from the mountains to the bottomless depths of her eyes

Well, she stands all around me, her hands slowly sifting the sunshine
All the laughter that lingered down deep 'neath her smilin' is free
Well, it spins and it twirls like a hummingbird lost in the morning
And caresses the south wind and silently sails to the sea

Ah, the sculptor stands stricken and the artist he throws away his brushes
When her image comes dancin', the sun, she turns sullen with shame
And the birds, they go silent, and the wind stops his sad mournful singing
When the trees of the forest start gently to whisperin' her name

So as softly she wanders, I'll desperately follow her footsteps
And I'll chase after shadows that offer a trace of her sigh
Ah, they promise eternally that she lies hidden within them
But I find they've deceived me and sadly I bid them goodbye

So the serpent slides slowly away with his moments of laughter
And the old washerwoman has finished her cleanin' and gone
But the bamboo hangs heavy in the bondage of quicksilver daydreams
And a lonely child longingly looks for a place to belong1Embed
