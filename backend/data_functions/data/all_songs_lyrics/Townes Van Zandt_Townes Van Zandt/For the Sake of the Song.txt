For the Sake of the Song Lyrics
Why does she sing
Her sad songs for me, I'm not the one
To tenderly bring
Her soft sympathy, I've just begun
To see my way clear and it's plain
If I stop I will fall
I can lay down a tear for her pain
Just a tear and that's all
What does she want me to do?
She says that she knows
That moments are rare
I suppose that it's true
Then on she goes to say I don't care
Aw, she knows that I do

Maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song
Who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong?

She'd like to think I was cruel
But she knows that's a lie for I would be
No more than a tool
If I allowed her to cry all over me
Ah my sorrow is real
Even though I can't change my plans
If she could see how I feel
Then I know she'd understand
Ah does she actually think I'm to blame?
Does she really believe that some word of mine
Could relieve all her pain?
Can't she see that she grieves
Just because she's been blindly deceived
By her shame

Ah but maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song
Who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong?

Ah but nothin's what it seems
Maybe she'll start some day to realize
If she abandons her dreams
Then all the words she can say are only lies
Ah when will she see that to gain
Is only to lose
All that she offers me are her chains
And I got to refuse
Ah but it's only to herself that she's lied
She likes to pretend
There's something that she should defend
With her pride
And I don't intend
To stand here and be the friend
From whom she must hide
Maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song
Who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong?
Ah but maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the songEmbed
