Colorado Girl Lyrics
Well I'm goin' out to Denver, see if I can't find
Well I'm goin' out to Denver, see if I can't find
That loving Colorado girl of mine

Well, the promise in her smile shames the mountains tall
Ah, the promise in her smile shames the mountains tall
She can bring the sun to shining, tell the rain to fall

It's been a long time, Mama, since I heard you call my name
Ah, been a long time since I heard you call my name
I got to see my Colorado girl again

Be there tomorrow, Mama, don't you cry
Be there tomorrow, now Mama, don't you cry
I got to kiss these lonesome Texas blues goodbye

Well I'm goin' out to to Denver, see if I can't find
Well I'm goin' out to to Denver, gonna see if I can't find
That loving Colorado girl of mine
That loving Colorado girl of mineEmbed
