Lungs Lyrics
Won't you lend your lungs to me? Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe up the time that's passing
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give, pray the day's not poison
Stand among the ones that live in lonely indecision

Fingers walk the darkness down, mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found, you fool, it's only moonlight
And if you stop to take it home, your hands will turn to butter
Better leave this dream alone, try to find another

Salvation sat and crossed herself and called the Devil" partner"
Wisdom burned upon a shelf, who'll kill the raging cancer
Seal the river at its mouth, take the water prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries, bathe in fiery answers

Jesus was an only son and love, his only concept
Strangers cry in foreign tongues and dirty up the doorstep
And I, for one, and you, for two, ain't got the time for outside
Keep your injured looks to you, we'll tell the world that we tried2Embed
