Tell Me Are You Tired Lyrics
What do you do when you're down and out
Do you sit and sigh and wonder why
If the answer just comes right to you
Its letting you know just what to do
Oh, your lady is tired of you running around
And if you don't stop shell put you down
Says shes got some good to give
All of her love and affection here
All you got to do is stop running around

Tell me, are you tired
Tell me, are you tired running around
Tell me, are you tired running around
Tell me, are you tired
Tell me, are you tired playing round town
Tell me, are you tired
Tell me, are you tired getting down on the town
 
Stay at home, stay at home

Lady says she needs your love
It just can't come from up above
She doesn't want to be by herself
Says she wants you and no one else
Knows you bring home the bread
That's half the plan, stay and hold her hand
You being home is surely missed
All she wants is you to hug and kiss
All you got to do is start stay at home

 
Stay at home, stay at homeEmbed
