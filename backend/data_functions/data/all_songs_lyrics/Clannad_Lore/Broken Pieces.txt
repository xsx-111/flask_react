Broken Pieces LyricsBroken pieces everywhere
I stilled my mind, and found I care
Running on the morning tide
Something you would say to me
We drank the waters of delight
We played the games of wrong and right
Did we understand
They're just footsteps in the sand?
Oh long dreaming, find my tears
I could love you, all the years
There are times like today
The wind will blow in a gentle way
Mark it down in frozen glass
Lied to me that i could win
So many ways to share a love
With words and touch we promised much
Do we understand
The footsteps in the sand?
I believe
I believe too easily
I believe
I believe too easily
Oh long dreaming find my tears
I could love you all the years
Here I stand still the same
I guess this showcase changed the name
Hard to know who plays the fool
Never looking back on years
I wonder now witch way to face
I catch a vision of this place
Did we understand
The footsteps in the sand?Embed
