The Good Lord LyricsPeople, people can't you see and know
What is really going on?
It's that same old thing, it's, it's nothing new
More than 2,000 years ago
The Good Lord send me from Zion
The Good Lord, you send me down
The Good Lord send me from Zion
The Good Lord, you send me down
All my days I've lived in misery
Whishing one day to be free
Now I bend down on my, my knees and pray
And these are the words that I say:
The Good Lord send me from Zion, yes he done
The Good Lord, you send me down
The Good Lord send me from Zion, send me down
The Good Lord, you send me down
The Good Lord, you send me down
The Good Lord, you send me down, from Zion..
The Good Lord from Zion...Embed
