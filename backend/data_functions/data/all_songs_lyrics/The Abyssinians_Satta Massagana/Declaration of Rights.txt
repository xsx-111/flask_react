Declaration of Rights LyricsLook, oh Lord, they brought us down here
Have us in bondage, right through these years
Fussing and fighting, among ourselves
Nothing to achieve this way, it's worser than hell, I say
Get up and fight for your rights my brothers
Get up and fight for your rights my sisters
Took us away from civilization
Brought us to slave in this big plantation
Fussing and fighting, among ourselves
Nothing to achieve this way, it's worse here than hell, I say
Get up and fight for your right, my brother
Get up and fight for your right, my sister
Took us away from civilization
Brought us to slave in this big plantation
Fussing and fighting, among ourselves
Nothing to achieve this way, it's worse here than hell, I say
Get up and fight for your right, my brother
Get up and fight for your right, my sister
Get up and fight for your right, my brother
Get up and fight for your right, my sister
Get up and fight for your right, my brother
Get up and fight for your right, my sisterEmbed
