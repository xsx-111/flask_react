Abendigo LyricsAbednego lyrics
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Working dead(?) to be thrown in the furnace
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
They had no fear, no fear at all
It was Igziabeher, yim mas gan
It was God, let him be praised
It was Igziabeher, yim mas gan
It was God, let him be praised
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
It was three, now it's four in the fire
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
All were amazed by such mighty power
It was Igziabeher, yim mas gan
It was God, let him be praised
It was Igziabeher, yim mas gan
It was God, let him be praised
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Shadrach, Meshach and AbednegoEmbed
