I and I LyricsI and I and I and I (I and I and I)
Save yourself, oh baby at least (I and I and I)
Love yourself equally (I and I and I)
United we stand (united we stand)
And divided we fall
We're marching to a better situation
The whole world is a new generation
I and I and I and I (I and I and I)
…
I and I and I and I (I and I and I)
Love your brother respectfully (I and I and I)
Save each other truthfully (I and I and I)
United we stand (united we stand)
And divided we fall
We're marching to a better situation
The whole world is a new generation
I and I and I and I (I and I and I)
I and I and I and I (I and I and I)
I and I and I and I (I and I and I)
I and I and I and I (I and I and I)
Love yourself respectfully (I and I and I)
I and I and I and I (I and I and I)
I and I and I and I (I and I and I)
I and I and I and I (I and I and I)…Embed
