Forward Unto Zion LyricsWe walk, we walk fe forward on a yard
We walk, we walk fe forward on a yard
I call upon the leaders of this time
To send the children, oh, now in this time
I call upon the head of society
To free the children now of captivity
And send us unto Zion city
Send us unto Zion
Send us, send us on
Fe go drink milk and honey
Send us unto Zion
Beautiful Zion
We walk, we walk fe forward on a yard
We walk, we walk fe forward on a yard
They say that slavery was abolished
Long, long time ago, oh yeah
And man should forward, oh, now in this time
Now I know, oh please
Send us unto Zion city
Send us unto Zion, you've got to
Send us, send us on
Fe go drink milk and honey
Send us unto Zion
Beautiful Zion
We walk, we walk fe forward on a yard
We walk, we walk fe forward on a yard
We haffe forward a yard
We must forward on
We haffe forward a yardEmbed
