Know Jah Today LyricsKnow Jah today and not tomorrow
Know Jah today and there'll be no sorrow
Tomorrow will be too late
And you'll be knockin' on the gate
So don't, don't let this chance pass you by
You don't, don't know what lies ahead
Tomorrow will be too late
And you'll be knockin' on the gate
So don't, don't let this chance pass you by
You don't, don't know what lies ahead
Know Jah today and not, and not tomorrow
Know HIM I say and there'll be no sorrow
You got to know Jah today and not, and not tomorrow
Know HIM I say, know HIM I say
You got to know Jah today, know HIM I say
You better know Jah today, there's no other way...Embed
