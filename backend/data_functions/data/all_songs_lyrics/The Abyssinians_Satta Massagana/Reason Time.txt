Reason Time LyricsYou a mi sista, yeah
Mi a yu bredda
God love us all
Let's love each other
Come, we go reason now
Come, come, come we go reason now
Come, we go walk an talk
Come, we go reason now
No fussing or fighting
We're going forward
We a no warrior
But we a conqueror
Come, we go reason now
Come, we go reason nowEmbed
