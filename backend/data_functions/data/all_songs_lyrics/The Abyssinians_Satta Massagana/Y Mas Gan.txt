Let him be praised continually
Khibil ahamlack, yim mas gan

He will take us by the hand
And lead us to the wonderland
If we can be good, we'll be careful
And do the best we can

And lead us to the wonderland
If we can be good, we'll be careful
And do the best we can

Glory to god, let him be praised
He will take us by the hand
And lead us to the wonderland
If we can be good, we'll be careful
And do the best we can
