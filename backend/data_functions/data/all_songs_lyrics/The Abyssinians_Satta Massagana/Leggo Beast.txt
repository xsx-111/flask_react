Leggo Beast LyricsMmm...
Here come some wicked men
Coming fe hurt me and me friend
Acting like a wild pagan
Peeping like a leggo beast
To a cannibals fierce
They came on strong and broke the peace
And when they came all tongues cease
They came with guns and licking sticks
They meant no fun, we knew their tricks
Each one with his rock steady
And his pistol cocked ready
Mmm...
They came on strong and broke the peace
And when they came all tongues cease
They came with guns and licking sticks
They meant no fun, we knew their tricks
Each one with his rock steady
And his pistol cocked ready
Mmm...
We, we don't know wrong
We're all God's children
And we are strong
You can, you can hurt us now
You can, you can hurt us now
Cause we are strong
Strong, strong, strong, strong, oh
Mmm..Embed
