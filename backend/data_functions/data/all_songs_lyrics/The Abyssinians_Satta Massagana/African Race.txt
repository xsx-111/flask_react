African Race LyricsWe are the slave descendants of the African race
African race, the African race
We are the slave descendants of the African race
Where proud is no disgrace
Our forefathers were taken away, taken away, taken away
They were bound in ships and shackled all the way
Like baggage and brought the west
They swapped my brother now, also, my sister too
For a drink of wine, so they could drink and be merry
So they could drink and be merry
I speak Amharic, my sister speaks Swahili
They put us together now, that's why we can't understand
That's why we can't understand
We are the slave descendants of the African race
African race, the African race
We are the slave descendants of the African race
Where proud is no disgrace
We're proud of our African race (is no disgrace)
Where proud is no disgrace
We're proud of our African race (is no disgrace)
