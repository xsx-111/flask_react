There Is No End LyricsYes, my friend
This is not the end
You've got life to live, my friend
And not life to give
Stop blaming yourself
And find someone else
I'm not the only fool
Stop beaking the rule
Things you did to me
Puts you in misery
Stop going around, blaming yourself
For the things done by someone else
Do the right things, speak the truth
And your days will be much longer
Tomorrow is another day, day
Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is another day
I'm not the only fool
Stop beaking the rule
Things you did to me
Puts you in misery
Stop going around, blaming yourself
For the things done by someone else
Do the right things, speak the truth
And your days will be much longer
Tomorrow is another day, day
Tomorrow is another day
So don't you go away and stay
Tomorrow is another dayEmbed
