Satta Massagana Lyrics
There is a land far, far away
Where there's no night, there's only day
Look into the book of life and you will see
That there's a land far, far away
That there's a land far, far away

The King of Kings and the Lord of Lords
Sit upon his throne and He rules us all
Look into the book of life and you will see
That He rules us all
That He rules us all (He rules us all)


The King of Kings and the Lord of Lords
Sit upon his throne and He rules us all
Look into the book of life and you will see
That He rules us all
That He rules us all (He rules us all)

There is a land far, far away
Where there's no night, there's only day
Look into the book of life and you will see
That there's a land far, far away
That there's a land far, far away
