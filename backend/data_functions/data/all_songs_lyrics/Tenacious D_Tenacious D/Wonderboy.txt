Wonderboy Lyrics
High above the mucky-muck
Castle made of clouds
There sits Wonderboy
Sitting oh so proudly
Not much to say
When you're high above the mucky-muck
Yeah, yeah

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away
From the mucky-muck man

Now it's time for me to tell you about Young Nastyman
Arch-rival and nemesis of Wonderboy
With powers comparable to Wonderboy
What powers you ask?
I don't know how about the power of flight
That do anything for ya?
That's levitation, holmes
How about the power to kill a yak
From 200 yards away
With mind-bullets
That's telekinesis, Kyle
How about the power
To move you
History of Wonderboy
And Young Nastyman
Rigga-goo-goo
Riggah-goo-goo
A secret to be told
A gold chest to be bold
And blasting forth
With three-part harmony
Yeow!

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away
From the mucky-muck man

Well Wonderboy and Young Nastyman joined forces
They formed a band the likes of which had never been seen
And they called themselves Tenacious D
That's right

Me
And KG
(That's me)
We're now Tenacious D
Come fly with me, fly

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away
From the mucky-muck man

Oh
Take my hand
Young Nastyman
And we'll fly
Bring out your broadsword
There's the Hydra
Slice his throat
And grab his scrot'
You take the high road
I'll take the low
There, the crevasse, fill it
With your mighty juice5Embed
