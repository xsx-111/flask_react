City Hall Lyrics
All you people up there
In City Hall
You're fucking it up
For the people that's in the streets
This is a song for the people in the streets
Not the people City Hall
All you motherfuckers in the streets
It's time to rise up
Come along children
And fucking rise

Lots of times when me and KG are watching
All the fucking shit that goes down at City Hall
We get the feeling we should fuck shit up
Yeah, we should fucking start a riot
A riot!

We have 'em screaming in the streets
We have tipping over shit
And breaking fucking windows of small businesses
And settin' fuckin' fires
And settin' fuckin' fires
And settin' fuckin' fires
And then after the smoke has cleared
And the rubble has been swept away
Me and KG will peek out our heads
We've been watching the riots on a monitor
Twenty floors below sea level
From a bunker
We did it Rage-Kage
We beat the bastards of City Hall
Maniacal laughter
But now what will we do?
We must rebuild
But who will lead us in the rebuilding process?
Man, it's got to be someone with the know-how
And the elbow grease
To lead us to a new land
No, not me and KG
We don't have the cognitive capacity to lead
Alright, we'll do it!

We'll lead as Two Kings
We'll lead as Two Kings
Ah-aaahh
(We'll lead as Two Kings)
Haa-aah
We'll lead as Two Kings
The first decree
Is to legalize marijuana
The tyranny and the bullshit's gone on too long
You old fucking shrivs
Who blocked its legalization
You're banished from the land!

We'll lead as Two Kings
We'll lead as Two Kings
A-haaaaaaa
(We'll lead as Two Kings)
Ha-ah, ah-a
Lead as Two Kings

The second decree
No more pollution
No more car exhaust
Or ocean dumpage
From now on we will travel in tubes

We'll lead as Two Kings, oh, yeah
We'll fucking lead as Two Kings
Get the scientists working
On the tube technology immediately
(Tube technology)
Chop, chop, let's go
Third decree
No more
Rich people
And poor people
From now on
We will all be the same
Umm... I don't know
I gotta think about that

We'll lead as Two Kings
Ah-yah-ah-ha-ha
Ah-yah-ah-ha-hah
Ha-ha-ho-hee
Ho-ha-ho-hee
Ha-ha-ho-hoh

Oh my God
(Ahh... What)
Dude, the red phone is flashing
(Oh, yeah)
Let me scoop that up
Hello? Two Kings
(Who is it)
What? No! No fucking way
(What)
Rage, there's a potato famine in Idaho
You gotta go down there
(Oh my God... What?)
Dude, I gotta stay here
(Why do I have to go?)
Please! Please
(Oh, God, okay, fine)
Awesome... Is he gone?
Alright, emergency meeting of Parliament
Alright, Parliament, I know this is fucked up
But, Rage, he can't be King anymore
Dudes, he's encroaching on my decrees
Seriously, let's make him Duke
Like a kickass Duke
Or "Leader Formerly Known as King"
But, uh-oh, he's coming back

We'll lead as Two Kings, oh yes
We'll really lead as Two Kings

(Uh, dude)
Rage
(I went all over Idaho)
Yeah?
(Uh, plenty of potatoes everywhere)
What? There was no famine
(Yeah, there was no famine, no)
Dude
(I don't know what's uh...)
A toast...
(A toast?)
Long live The D
(Alright, long live The D)
Clinking of glasses
Long live me!
I'm sorry, I poisoned your wine
(What?)
For the good of the land
(You poi-?
I poisoned yours, haha, as well)
Noooooo!
No

City, city, city, city, city, city, shitty
Shitty, city, shitty, shitty, city, city, shitty
Hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall

People inside me
Are asking me to smoke up City Hall
'Cause no one here is talking
People inside me
Are asking me to blow up City Hall
'Cause no one here is rocking
People inside me
Are asking me to blow up City Hall
'Cause everyone is Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots
Everyone is Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots
Everyone is Rock 'Em Sock 'Em – Go! Oh!

Messy guitar picking
Don't– Cut that part out
(We've got it)

Um, do you believe in God?
(I believe, I believe)
You do?
(I believe in God
I believe in God)
Laughs
You do?
(I believe in God)
Laughs
Do you?
(I believe in God)


(Yeah, but you didn't fucking come out with this one)
Plays riff
I got some lyrics

Malibu nights
Tangerine dreams
Malibu neighs
Malibu dreams
Malibu
Making a poo
Stinky poo
Looking at you
Because it's time for my breakfast
It's time for some cheese
It's time for the stink
Time for the breeze
Time for the
