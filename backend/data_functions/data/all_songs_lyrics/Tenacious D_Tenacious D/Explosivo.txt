Explosivo Lyrics
I climb upon my faithful steed
Then we gonna ride
Gonna smoke some weed
Climb upon my big-assed steed
And ride, ride, ride

What's the name of the song, Explosivo!
Don't know what it's about, but it's good to go
What's the name of my girlfriend? I don't know
But she's built like the shit, and she's good to go, go
She's good to go, she's good to go

We are fueled by Satan
Yes, we're schooled by Satan
Fueled by Satan!
Writin' those tasty riffs
Just as fast as we can
Schooled by Satan!

We were the inventors
Of the cosmic astral code
We've come to blow you away
We've come to blow your nose
We've come to fuckin' blow
We've come to blow the show
We've come to fuckin' blow
You know it, you know it!
What's the name of the song, Explosivo!
Don't know what it's about but it's good to...

I am not one of you
I come from an ancient time
I am known as The Kicker of Elves
I am also known as The Angel Crusher
