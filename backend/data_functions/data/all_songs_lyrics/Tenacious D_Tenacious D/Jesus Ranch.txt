Jesus Ranch Lyrics
It was a big day on Jesus Ranch
Jesus Ranch

He was harvesting a big tomato, and
It was in the sand
Alright

I'm taking a walk in the woods
And it's nice outside
Smells of shit
Liga Guing, gliga-gigga-goo-gwayo-go

I come upon a silver striped mushroom
And I fa-la-la-la-ly, la-ly
And I fly, fly

It was a big day on Jesus Ranch
Jesus Ranch
Jesus

I fell in love with a baked potato
That's when I started to dance
Yeah, in France
I'm taking a walk in the woods
Fuck yeah
It's nice, very very nice
Smells of shit
Liga Guing, gliga-gigga-goo-gwayo-go

I come upon a silver striped mushroom
And I fla-la-la-la-ly, la-ly
And I fly, fly
Fla-la-la-la-ly, ly-ly
And I fly
I'm gone

A fligga-gu
Rigga-gu-hu
Rigga-gigga-gee-gu
Ruu-ga-guuunn
Rigga-gigga-gu-hu
Go!

I come upon a silver striped mushroom
And I fla-la-la-la-ly, la-ly
And I fly, fly
Fla-la-la-la-ly, ly-ly
And I fly
I'm gone
It was a big day on Jesus Ranch
Jesus Ranch
Jesus

I fell in love with a baked potato
Go!2Embed
