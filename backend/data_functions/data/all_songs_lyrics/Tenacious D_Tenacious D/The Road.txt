The Road Lyrics
The road is fuckin' hard
The road is fuckin' tough-ah
There's no question that-ah
It is rough rough stuff
It's the fuckin' road my friend
But it's the only road I know
When I'm lunchin' on a tasty bush
Right after the show
You g-go go go!

The road is fuckin' hard
It's also really fuckin' tough
There's no question that-ah
It don't take no guff
The road is a b-i-tch, my friend
But it's the only fuckin' road I know
When I'm snackin' on a tasty bush
Right after the show
You g-go go go

I met a tasty baby in Michigan
We screwed two times, then I left
Sometimes I think of my baby in Michigan
Why can't I stay in one place
For more than two days
Why?!
Because I'm talkin' about the road
Because I'm talkin' about the road
Because I'm talkin' about the road
Because I'm talkin' about the road
Because I'm talkin' about the road
