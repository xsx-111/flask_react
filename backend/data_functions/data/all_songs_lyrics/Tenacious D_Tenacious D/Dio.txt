Dio Lyrics
Dio has rocked for a long, long time
Now it's time for him to pass the torch
He has songs of wildebeests and angels
He has soared on the wings of a demon

It's time to pass the torch
You're too old to rock
No more rockin' for you
We're taking you to a home
But we will sing a song about you

And we will make sure
That you're very well taken care of
You'll tell us secrets that you've learned

Oh!
Your sauce will mix with ours
And we'll make a good goulash, baby
Dio
Time to go
You must give your cape and scepter
To me
And a smaller one for KG
Go
Go
Dio
Dio, oh7Embed
