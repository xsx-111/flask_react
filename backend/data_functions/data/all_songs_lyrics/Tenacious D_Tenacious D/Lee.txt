Lee Lyrics
Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee
Lee L-Lee, L-Lee, Lee Lee L-Lee
We're talkin' fuckin' Lee
I had a friend named Lee
He cast a spell, a spell on me
If me
And Lee
And KG
Could be three
Flying free
Tenaciously
Skinny dipping in a sea of Lee
I'd propose on bended knee
To Lee Lee Lee
Lee Lee Lee
Lee Lee
Lee Lee Lee
Lee Lee Lee
Lee Lee
Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee
Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee

If me
And Lee
And KG (That's me)
Could be three (Be three)
Plant a tree (Plant a tree)
Just for Lee (Just for Lee)
Just for Lee (Lee!)
Just for Lee
For Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee
Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee
Lee, Lee, Leee
Ah, Lee
