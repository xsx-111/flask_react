Rock Your Socks Lyrics
One, two, three, four, five
6-6-6

It doesn't matter if it is good
It only matters if it rocks
The main thing that we do
Is to rock your socks off
There's no such thing as a rock prodigy
'Cause rock-n-roll is bogus
Right KG?  Right
Only thing that really matters
Is a classical sauce
And that's why me and KG
Are classically trained
To rock your fuckin' socks off
Give 'em a taste KG
(Okay)

That is Bach
And it rocks
It's a rock block of Bach
That he learned in the school
Called the school of hard knocks
Give it up for KG, give it up for me
Give it up for KG, give it up for me
Give it up for rock, give it up for blues
Give it up for everything that is not to lose
Now rock your socks off woman
We'll rock your shit up y'all
Give it up children now to freak your shit out
All right

Now I know what a lot of you are saying
"I just figured out what I'm gonna do
With the rest of my days
I'm gonna get me an oversized guitar
Gain forty pounds
And be the next D!"
Well, I got sour news for you Jack
It ain't that easy
For instance
Are you willing to make the commitment
To waking up at the crack of noon
For deep-knee rock squats
Seven or eight at a time
In a row
How 'bout are you willing to make the commitment
To rock hard tasty abs, washer board style
Glistening in the sun
How 'bout are you willing to make the commitment
Waking up, going "Okay, it's gig time
What T-shirt am I gonna wear?
Can't decide, can't decide
Brain aneurysm!"
We've been through so much bullshit
Just to be here tonight
To rock your fuckin' socks off
And all we ask in return is so precious little
All we're askin' you to do
Is drop trou'
And squeeze out
A Cleveland Steamer
On my chest
(Oh...)
Two, three, four
Give it up for KG, give it up for me
Give it up for KG, give it up for me
Give it up for rock, give it up for blues
Give it up for everything that is not to lose
Now rock your socks off woman
We'll rock your shit up y'all
Give it up children, not to freak your shit out
Ah-all right

Aw
What?!
Aah
Yeah!
Aaah
Yeaaah9Embed
