Kielbasa Lyrics
(Dude we gotta fuckin' write somethin' new
Come on)
Strums a chord
I don't like that
So far, ba-- Off to a bad start
KG strums another chord
Better, closer, warmer
KG strums another chord
That's it! Okay
Music starts up

I love ya baby
But all I can think about is
Kielbasa sausage
Your butt cheeks is warm
I check my dipstick
You need lubrication, honey
My kielbasa sausage
Has just got to perform
Now get it on

I see ya walkin'
But all I can think about is
Dianetics
Your butt cheeks is warm
I check my dipstick
You need lubrication, honey
My kielbasa sausage
Has just got to perform
Now I been set loose, ah
I'm shooting my juice, ah
Right in your caboose
Now fuckin' get it on
Now get it on
Get it on
Dianetics junior much better than Krishna
Dianetics cure you much better indeed
And all you people here, you're tremendous
(Except the people in the back)
And you're smoking up a big-ass bowl of weed
With me
And KG
All right
Oh yeah
All right
Oh my God
All the ladies in the house say yeah (yeah)
All you motherfuckers say a prayer (prayer)
When you fight, you got to fight fair
You motherfucker, oh, you motherfucker
You know what time it is?
Tenacious D time
You motherfucker, go!
Fuck yeah
Yeah, yeah

Dude, that was TNT4Embed
