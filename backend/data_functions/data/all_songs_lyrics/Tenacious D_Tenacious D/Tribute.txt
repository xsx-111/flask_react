Tribute Lyrics
This is the greatest and best song in the world...
...tribute

Long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said
"Play the best song in the world
Or I'll eat your soul" (Soul)

Well, me and Kyle
We looked at each other
And we each said
"Okay"
And we played the first thing that came to our heads
Just so happened to be
The best song in the world
It was the best song in the world

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two
Two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine
And the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow
Needless to say
The beast was stunned
A whip-crack went his whippy tail
And the beast was done
He asked us *snort*
"Be you angels?"
And we said, "Nay
We are but men!" Rock
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah
Ohhh, whoah
Ah-whoah-oh

This is not the greatest song in the world, no
This is just a tribute
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, no
No, this is a tribute, oh
To the greatest song in the world, alright
It was the greatest song in the world, alright
Yeah, it was the best motherfuckin' song
The greatest song in the world

Ah-rah, dee
Soo-guh-goo-gee-goo-gee
Goo-guh fli-goo gee-goo
Guh fli-goo, ga-goo-buh-dee
Ooh, guh-goo-bee
Ooh-guh-guh-bee-guh-guh-bee
Fli-goo gee-goo
A-fliguh woo-wa mama Lucifer!
And the peculiar thing is this, my friends
The song we sang on that fateful night
It didn't actually sound anything like this song

This is just a tribute
You've got to believe me
And I wish you were there
Just a matter of opinion
Ah, fuck!
Good God, gotta love it
So surprised to find you can't stop it
A fiery ring of fire
Rich motherfucker, aw
Alright
