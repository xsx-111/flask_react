KG: What?! What?! God! I was sleeping dude! What are you talking about?
JB: Oh, my god...
KG: What?
JB: I did it
KG: What'd you do?
JB: I've done it, I fucking did it

JB: The most powerful tool in singing technology since yodeling, dude. Oh my God, inward singing
KG: What?
JB: Check it out, it's an invention and it makes non-stop rocking possible. Think about it, man! Rock singers are only rocking you half the time, the other time they're... they're... they're... they're... breathing - in, but not any more baby! Hahahahaha! Not with inward singing. Check it out...
*Singing* And then I start some lyrics and you
*Inward Singing* Can't believe I'm singing
*Singing* And I'm never fucking stopping and I'm
*Inward Singing* Always fucking singing and you...

*Singing* I'm like a fucking one man band, I'm like a fucking one man

JB: Ahh, shut up! It is non stop and the other thing is that when I'm fucking singing in it sounds even BETTER than when I'm singing out! Shut up! Fuck you! You fucking dick! Always nay-saying everything I create! You piece of shit, you create something like inward singing! You fucking shit you fucking sit in your tower...

JB: ... and fucking nap... what's funny? You fucking bitch!
*Kage continues to laugh*
JB: Fucking, fuck yeah, fucking... cockass!  You're fired from the band
