Double Team Lyrics
Damn
A hard day's rocking
Better slip off m' shoes
Maybe give a little stretch, ah
And a bend
Dip m' toe to jacuzzi, baby
Slip out this book
The Buttress of Windsor
Ho-ho-ho, who's this?
How's it going?

That's the first thing I say to you
How's it going?
Are you flowing?
Listen honey
Thinking 'bout a couple things to say to you
Showing
Growing
Man I'd like to place my hand
Upon your fucking sexy ass, and squeeze
And squeeze

Take off your blouse
And your underpants
Then take a look
'Cause here me and KG come naked
Out of the side hatch
With the oils and perfume and incense
Now you're grooving
Put on a cool '70s groove
A funky groove to fuck to
A funky groove to fuck to
Me, me and KG
It's all about sex supreme
We likes to cream jeans (Sex)
Have you ever been worked on
By two guys who are hot for your snatch (Sex)
That's what I'm offering you
You step into our room
And then you smell the perfume
You lay upon our roundish bed
And then you feel a tickling on your head
It's KG with the feather and the French tickler
Look out baby, he got the tools
And then you feel something down by your feet
It's me, it's JB
I'm sucking upon your toes

We don't mind sucking on toes
Good luck finding
A boyfriend who sucks toes, oh
Having sex with me and KG
Now you're talking double team
Supreme

Let's roll
(Ahhh) Ah, haa-aah
What? Yeah
Huh? Nah
Ohhh
Ah, that's it, that's right
Ohmygah, oh-I-think-I'm-gonna
Ohh! Deht! Deht! Eee
Splooge
That was the one
(Hail Satan)
Hail Satan
(Hail Satan)
Hail Satan15Embed
