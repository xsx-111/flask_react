Living Sin LyricsWill you stand up or will you freeze
That savage woman make you pleased
Turn your inside outside in
Still you don't know where she has been
Living sin
Can't you see through
She's going to realize the way to sound you
Finally ground you
Sullen
Never cured by a one night lover
Tell you
Stories of a meeting with a younger brother
Twisting
All the people lyin' just to find a cover
No one
Ever gonna pry her from a two-faced mother
Can't you see through
She's going to realize the way to sound you
Took you, never saw it coming
Hooked you up with Coca-Cola cunning
Nice and slipperyEmbed
