Working All Day LyricsWorking all day, I'm digging up the roads
Just working all day
Dig for my pay and spend it where I like
I've nothing to say
Drown in my sweat but money buys escape
I've got no regrets
Working all day
Working all day
When I was young I used to have illusions
Dreams ain't enough
Father was rough, he didn't care for learning
Hell life is tough
Easy to say that everybody's equal
Then look around and see it ain't true
Working all day
I eat the dust, the boss gets all the money
Life ain't just
I'm still the same as all the other people
Who can I trust?
Working all day and never getting nowhere
What can I say, working all day
Working all dayEmbed
