Mister Class and Quality? LyricsLook around my rooms
And see the prizes I have showing
Working hard to build my life
And plan the way I'm going
House and car and pretty wife
They've all been won by knowing
All been won by knowing
All been won by knowing
Paperwork, white collared shirts
Where would we be without them
Man of class and quality
I never shout about them
Choose my friends for my own ends
You can't succeed without them
Can't succeed without them
Can't succeed without them
Middleman sees straight ahead
And never crosses borders
Never understood the artist
Or the lazy workers
The world needs steady men like me
To give and take the orders
Give and take the orders
Give and take the ordersEmbed
