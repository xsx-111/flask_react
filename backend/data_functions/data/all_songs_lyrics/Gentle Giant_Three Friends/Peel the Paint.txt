Peel the Paint LyricsFree from the start, left to depart
Finding the pleasure and the pain in his art
Lost in the hush, no need to rush
Time waits for him, him who creates with the brush
Colour the brush
High in the air, his dreams are there
Searching for answers he will look everywhere
Thinks he has won, a place in the sun
Free from the worries and the ways of everyone
Colour the brush
I peel the paint, look underneath
You'll see the same, the same old savage beast
Strip the coats, the coats of time
And find mad eyes and see those sharpened teeth
Nothing's been learned, no nothing at all
And don't be fooled, get up before you fall
A carnal grave, a crawling smooth
Open flesh and you must let him in
Glass reflects of what you are
It shows the face, the evil face of sin
Nothing's been learned, no nothing at all
And don't be fooled, get up before you fall
Nothing's been learned, no nothing at all
And don't be fooled, get up before you fallEmbed
