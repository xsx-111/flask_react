Schooldays LyricsThe bell rings
And all things are calling
The days past
The play's cast
Remember
September
When we were
Together, together, together
Schooldays, the happy days
When we were going nowhere
Schootime, the happy time
When we were feeling no care
Schooldays when we three said
That we'd better be friends forever
How long is ever isn't it strange
Schooldays together why do they change
How long is ever isn't it strange
Did kites fly
And I spy
And you cry to run fast
Or come last
You know how we made vows
They're gone now
We made friends, we broke friends
No more friends
Schooldays, the happy days
When we were going nowhere
School-time, the happy time
When we were feeling no care
(x3)
How long is ever isn't it strange
Schooldays together why do they change

(x3)
How long is ever isn't it strange
Schooldays together why do they change
Remember
Remember when we
Together
Went to the sea
Seagull's scream and pink ice cream
And the deep blue sky and the waves seem high
And golden sand and the town
Brass band plays on
Wait for me
Wait for us always
Wait for me
Wait for us to come
Mister Watson wants to see you
In the master's room
It's about the work you should have done
And I think you must go now
Remember
Gone, gone
Gone
(x4)
How long is ever isn't it strange
Schooldays together why do they change1Embed
