Prologue LyricsThree friends are made, three lives are laughs and tears
Through years of school and play they share
As time stands still the days change into years
And future comes without a care
But fate and skill and chances play their part
The wind of change leaves no good-bye
Three boys are men their ways have drawn apart
They tell their tales to justifyEmbed
