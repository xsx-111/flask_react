Running Lyrics
Fading true
I met you, walk my mind
Terrible
Loving whole, I'm just laughing
Because I​ feel you
In my mind all the time
Because I see you
In my hands everyday

You got me running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Just like you
You got me running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Just like you

Fading true
I met you, walk my mind
Terrible
Loving whole, I'm just laughing
Because I​ feel you
In my mind all the time
Because I see you
In my hands everyday
You got me running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Just like you
You got me running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Just like you1Embed
