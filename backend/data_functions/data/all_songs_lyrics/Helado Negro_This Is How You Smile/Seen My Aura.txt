Seen My Aura Lyrics
Woke up knowing
Knowing that you'll be here again
You take me for a ride
Even though I'm sleeping again

Swimming in the rain, lightning purple sky
I see you walking up to the pool
Holding my breath underwater, keeping my eyes open 'til
I see you swim to me and I'll kiss you

Got no shoes on
Walking on sun burned pavement, tryna look cool
I see my aura for the first time
Right in front of you

Sitting with the sky
Letting the sun burn me 'til the night comes
I'll be dark, yeah
Floatin' from side to side
Pushing stars for the ride as we glide our minds
Glide our minds
Swimming in the rain, lightning purple sky
I see you walking up to the pool
Holding my breath underwater, keeping my eyes open 'til
I see you swim to me, then I'll kiss you

I got no shoes on
Walking on sun burned pavement, tryna look cool
I see my aura for the first time
Right in front of you

Sitting with the sky
Letting the sun burn me 'til the night comes
I'll be dark, yeah
Floatin' from side to side
Pushing stars for the ride as we glide our minds
Glide our mindsEmbed
