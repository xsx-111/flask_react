Imagining What to Do Lyrics
I'll sing you this part
When we go to sleep
Winter will be gone tomorrow
Just lay inside your dream

'Cause it's cold
And hard to remember what the sun feels like
And it's okay to cry
When it feels like it won't ever come back

But we know
How melting into summer
Just to make it go
Go slow
We'll stay under the covers
Until there's no snow
Please go

The two of us draw smiles
Laughing, half a whistling slowly
We wait softly
Looking for the sun to come back tomorrow
I'll see you waiting for the glow again
The two of us draw smiles
Laughing, half a whistling slowly
We wait softly
Looking for the sun to come back tomorrow
I'll see you waiting for the glow againEmbed
