Two Lucky Lyrics
Take care of people today
Hold their hand
Call them up if you wanna say

"Hey, I miss the way we used to hug
We used to dance a tiny bit
Just kids with love, we lasted so long
We knew nothing about this shit"

So who are we to explain this mystery?
So who are we to explain this history?

Take care of people today
Hold their hand
Call them up if you wanna say

"Hey, I miss the way we used to hug
We used to dance a tiny bit
Just kids with love, we lasted so long
We knew nothing about this shit"
So who are we to explain this mystery?
So who are we to explain this history?
So who are we to explain this mystery?
So who are we to explain this history?Embed
