Camarillas Lyrics
You’re not on my mind
You know that’s a lie
Well I have been overthinking again
But not ‘cause of you
You know that’s not true
Well nothing I’m saying makes any sense
I’m not losing faith
I just don’t relate
Don’t do so well with waiting around
So just let me know
Do I hold or let go?
Please do something

‘Cause all I hear are your camarillas
Compliment the nonsense you’re knitting and
Colour in the fields
Rub you off with rubber love
They don't care

That’s not fair
I am aware
I’ve punched up your private parties and more
There I go again
Dissing your friends
You’ve done the same
But that’s in the past
There’s no one to ask
How long this will last
I’ve shaved this silence
It keeps growing back
So let it grow a beard
And everyone cheers
‘Cause freedom is wild
And it means it, but
Your camarillas
Compliment the nonsense you’re knitting and
Colour in the field
Rub you off with rubber love

I don’t mean to be rude
And I’m not in a mood
And even if I was
Well surely that’s only human
Better let it out
With a quick scream and shout
Maybe that’s just how we’re differentEmbed
