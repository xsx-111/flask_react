Long Long Way Lyrics
Long, long way to the top
Long way down, if you fall
It's a long way back if you get lost

Long way out to the end
Long way to go to lose your friends
It's a long way to haul all the traps you've trawled
When you could just stop and let go

But you say
Not now, maybe later
But not now, maybe later
Not now (You're only in your way)
Maybe later
But not now (You're only in your way)
Maybe later
Not now (You're only in your way)
Maybe later
But not now (You're only in your way)
Maybe later
But not now (You're only in your way)
Maybe... wait
'Cause love is tough
When enough is not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enoughEmbed
