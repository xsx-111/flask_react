The Box Lyrics
Don't give me
Something to hold in my hand
Something else to believe in
Because I'm over it
And your reasons for wanting to stay
Your reasons for wanting to change
My reasons for everything are dull to you

Well, I have tried, but I don't fit
Into this box I'm living with
Well, I could go wild
But you might lock me up
I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box you call a gift
And I could be wild and free
But God forbid then you might envy me

So don't give me
Love with an old book of rules
That kind of love's just for fools
And I'm over it
And my reasons
For walking away
My reasons
For wanting to change
My reasons
For everything are lost with you
Well, I have tried, but I don't fit
Into this box I'm living with
Well, I could go wild
But you might lock me up
I have tried, but I don't fit
Into this box you call a gift
And I could be wild and free
But God forbid then you might envy me

I have tried, but I...
Into this box you call...
Well, I could go wild....
But you might lock me up
I have tried, but I...
Into this box you call... a gift
Well, I could be wild and free
But God forbid then you might envy me
Well, I could be wild and free
But God forbid then you might...4Embed
