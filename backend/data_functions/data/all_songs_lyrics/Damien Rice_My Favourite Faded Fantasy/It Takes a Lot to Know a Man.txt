It Takes a Lot to Know a Man Lyrics
It takes a lot to know a man
It takes a lot to understand
The warrior, the sage
The little boy enraged
It takes a lot to know a woman
A lot to understand what's humming
The honey-bee, the sting
The little girl with wings

It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to breathe
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

It takes a lot to know a man
A lot to know, to understand
The father and the son
The hunter and the gun
It takes a lot to know a woman
A lot to comprehend what's coming
The mother and the child
The muse and the beguiled
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to breathe
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to breathe
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs
It takes a lot to live
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to breathe
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs
What are you so afraid to lose?
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
What are you so afraid to lose?
(You wrote me to tell me
You're nervous and you're sorry)
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
(Crying like a baby
Saying, "this thing is killing me")
It takes a lot to know a man...
What are you so afraid to lose?
(You wrote me to tell me
You're nervous and you're sorry)
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
(Crying like a baby
Saying, "this thing is killing me")
It takes a lot to know a man...
What are you so afraid to lose?
(You wrote me to tell me
You're nervous and you're sorry)
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
(Crying like a baby
Saying, "this thing is killing me")
It takes a lot to know a man...
What are you so afraid to lose?
(You wrote me to tell me
You're nervous and you're sorry)
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
(Crying like a baby
Saying, "this thing is killing me")
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you carry on your back?
(You wrote me to tell me
You're nervous and you're sorry)
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you notice when you can't laugh?
(Know you can, have to know)
(Killing me)
