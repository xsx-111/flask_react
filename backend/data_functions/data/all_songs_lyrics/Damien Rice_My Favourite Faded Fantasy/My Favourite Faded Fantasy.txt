My Favourite Faded Fantasy Lyrics

You could be my favourite taste to touch my tongue
I know someone who could serve me love
But it wouldn't fill me up
You could have my favourite face and favourite name
I know someone who could play the part
But it wouldn't be the same

No, it wouldn't be the same
No, it wouldn't be the same
No, it wouldn't be the same
As with you

You could be my favourite place I've ever been
I got lost in your willingness
To dream within the dream
You could be my favourite faded fantasy
I've hung my happiness upon what it all could be

And what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
With you
What it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
With you
You could hold the secrets that save me from myself
I could love you more than love could
All the way from hell
You could be my poison, my cross, my razor blade
I could love you more than life
If I wasn't so afraid

Of what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
Of what it all, what it all could be
With you
What it all, what it all could be
Of what it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
With you

Love dissolved the bloom
Always watch it
Never let someone go or they
I ain't never loved like you

'Cause I've never loved
I've never loved
I've never loved another like you
I've never loved
I've never loved
I've never loved
I've never loved another like you
I've never loved
I've never loved2Embed
