Trusty and True Lyrics
We've wanted to be trusty and true
But feathers fell from our wings
And we've wanted to be worthy of you
But weather rained on our dreams

And we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So, fellas, lay down your fears
'Cause we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So let us start from here

'Cause we never wanted to be lusty or lewd
Nor tethered to prudish strings
And we never wanted to be jealously tuned
Nor withered into ugly things

But we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So, fellas, lay down your spears
'Cause we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So let us start from here
And if all that you are
Is not all you desire
Then come

Come, come alone
Come with fear, come with love
Come however you are
Just come, come alone
Come with friends, come with foes
Come however you are
Just come, come alone
(Come, let yourself be wrong)
Come with me, then let go
(Come, it's already begun)
Come however you are
(Come, let yourself be wrong)
Just come, come alone
(Come, it's already begun)
Come so carefully closed
(Come, let yourself be wrong)
Come however you are
(Come, it's already begun)
Just come
Come, come alone
(Come, let yourself be wrong)
Come with sorrows and songs
(Come, it's already begun)
Come however you are
(Come, let yourself be wrong)
Just come, come along
(Come, it's already begun)
Come, let yourself be wrong
(Come, let yourself be wrong)
Come however you are
(Come, it's already begun)
