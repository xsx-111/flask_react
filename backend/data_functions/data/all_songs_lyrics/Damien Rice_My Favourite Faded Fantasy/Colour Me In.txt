Colour Me In Lyrics
Well, I tried to repress it and I carried its crown
I reached out to undress it and love let me down
Love let me down

So I tried to erase it, but the ink bled right through
Almost drove myself crazy and these words led to you
And all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dog-less bone

So come let me love you
Come let me love you
And then... colour me in

Well, I tried to control it and cover it up
I reached out to console it, it was never enough
Never enough

So I tried to forget it, it was all part of the show
Told myself I'd regret it, but what do I know
About all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dog-less bone
So come let me love you
Come let me love you
And then... colour me in

Come let me love you
Come let me take this through the end
Of all these useless dreams of living
All these useless dreams
All these useless dreams of living
All these, oh no

So come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me in1Embed
