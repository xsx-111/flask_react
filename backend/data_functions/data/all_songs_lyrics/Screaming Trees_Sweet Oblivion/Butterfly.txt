Butterfly LyricsChanging memories they fade away
The hours and the days
While in the sunshine, the sunshine bright
I kept you on my mind
Cry, cry butterfly
Heard it on the wings that you're going to die
Cry, cry butterfly
Well I'm sick and I want to go home
Up to an empty room
Four walls around, nothing to be found
Of empty promises in a lonesome town
Let me lay you down
Cry, cry butterfly
Heard it on the wings that you're going to die
Cry, cry butterfly
Well I'm sick and I want to go home
The changing memories they fade away
In the hours in the day
While in the sunshine, the sunshine bright
I kept you on my mind
Cry, cry butterfly
Heard it on the wings that you're going to die
Cry, cry butterfly
And I'm sick and I want to go home
Cry, cry butterfly
Heard it on the wings that you're going to die
Cry, cry butterfly
And I'm sick and I want to go home
Well I'm sick and I want to go home
That I'm sick and I want to go homeEmbed
