No One Knows LyricsDon't turn away, you haven't yet awakened
Why don't you stay, remember what you said
Ten thousand miles and everyone's mistaken
Look where you've been
Where every woman's wasted
All the while you've been sleeping
Drifting on a wind never blown
Tomorrow you'll wake up aching
Wondering how, when no one really knows
Don't speak a word of all that you've been saving
If there isn't time then you should let it go
Into the fire and bring back all you've taken
Once more alone you'll never let it show
All the while you've been sleeping
Drifting on a wind never blown
Tomorrow you'll wake up aching
Wondering how, when no one really knows
Now what have I done wrong
Can't you tell me what have I done wrong
Baby tell me what have I done wrong
Don't walk away, you haven't yet awakened
Why don't you stay, remember what you said
Ten thousand miles, and everyone's mistaken
Look where you've been
Where every woman's wasted
All the while you've been sleeping
Drifting on a wind never blown
Tomorrow you'll wake up aching
Wondering how, when no one really knows
Now what have I done wrong
Can't you tell me what have I done wrong
Baby tell me what have I done wrong
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me nowEmbed
