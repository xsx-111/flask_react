Shadow of the Season LyricsThe hour is ending, can't you see
There is no way now, to get free
In the shadow of the season
Without a reason, to carry home
Without a reason, without a reason
And from the north woods
Down to the valley
In a world of hurting, I'm moving on
Out from the lighthouse
Out on the ocean
Can't climb the mountain, so very tall
Said Lord please give me what I need
He said there's pain and misery
Oh sweet oblivion feels alright
The hour is drawing ever closer
And rolling over, won't let me be
In the shadow of the season
To find a reason, to carry home
Said Lord please give me what I need
He said there's pain and misery
Oh sweet oblivion
She calls me onward to her side
And feels her song deep inside
And find a reason
In the shadow, of the season
To find a reason to carry home
In the shadow, of the season
To find a reason to carry home
Find a reason, to carry home
To carry home, to find a reason
To carry home, to carry homeEmbed
