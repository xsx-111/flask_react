For Celebrations Past Lyrics
This is for footsteps approaching the night
They keep themselves moving and do what is right
Now watch what you gather and hold in your hand
Numbers are many who misunderstand

Drink your wine away instead
I won't remember all that's said
Say farewell and close the door
You'll find me never more

That I believe in
That I believe in
That I believe in you
Must be a crying shame

Tell you a story of that which comes last
All of the sorrow that lives in the past
Now if you're tired of all that's been told
Don't be surprised that I've grown so old

Drink your wine away instead
I won't remember all that's said
Say farewell and close the door
You'll find me never more
And I believe in
That I believe in
That I believe in you
Must be a crying shame

Breathing in shadows or dead on the vine
I'm there in the morning to take you sometimes
To watch what you gather and hold in your hand
The numbers are many who misunderstand

Drink your wine away instead
I won't remember all that's said
Say farewell and close the door
You'll find me never more

And I believe in
That I believe in
That I believe in
That I believe in
That I believe in you
Must be a crying shameEmbed
