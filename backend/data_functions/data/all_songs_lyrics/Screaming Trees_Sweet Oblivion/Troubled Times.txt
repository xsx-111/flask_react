Troubled Times LyricsLay it to rest
You know my word ain't the best
It's just another question of faith
That I must take
Till it's laid to waste
Laid to waste
I stood and I watched you weep
Until I'm gone you're sure to cry some more
I stayed and lit a cigarette
I thought we'd been here some time before
Booked and I got to hurry
Troubled times and worry
Will turn your head away
Swear to you now I'm learning
Troubled times are turning
Turn your head away
She said that it's five AM
I think it's time for you to go
Got to hurry, got to get on board
And drink myself to sleep at home
Booked and I got to hurry
Troubled times and worry
Will turn your head away
Swear to you I'm learning
Troubled times are turning
Turn your head away
Shimmy on down baby (x 4)
Booked and I got to hurry
Troubled times and worry
Will turn your head away
Swear to you I'm learning
Troubled times are turning
Turn your head away
Booked and I got to hurry
Troubled times and worry
Will turn your head away
Swear to you I'm learning
Troubled times are turning
Turn your head away
Shimmy on down baby (X4)
Lay it to rest, you know my love ain't the best
This is just another question of taste
That I must take
Till it's laid to wasteEmbed
