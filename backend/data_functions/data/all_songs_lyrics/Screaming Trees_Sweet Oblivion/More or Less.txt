More or Less Lyrics
Now that we've run this road so many times
Tonight it will not take us home
Gonna go to that deep river
Where the water's moving slow

Feels like there's nothing to explain
(Nothing left to hear)
One more or less it's all the same
Now that it's feeling so much colder
(Coming back again)
Just be glad that it's all over

Now that we've closed our eyes so many times
Tonight I cannot see a thing
Gonna go to that deep river
Where the water's moving slow

Feels like there's nothing to explain
(Nothing left to hear)
And now you know just who to blame
For why you're feeling so much colder
(Coming back again)
Just be glad that it's all over
Gonna go to that deep river2Embed
