The Pin Drop LyricsCarried away by the river that passes
Through bulrushes on to the sea
Dragged by the current to rest on the stakes
Of the breakwater shaded by trees
Beginnings and endings
Love intersecting a rift that will break us apart
Love learned
In turn
Dreams burned
I am tired of struggling
And the rain is beating down on me
I tried to be the way that he wanted me to be
I did not hear the pin drop down
I did not hear my heart
I have not lived and loved enough
Things are left unsaid, undone
It was not to meant to be like this
Drifting off without a kiss
We built our love, we built our ark
Nothing ends before it starts
I cannot feel my arms and legs
I don't deserve this bitter endEmbed
