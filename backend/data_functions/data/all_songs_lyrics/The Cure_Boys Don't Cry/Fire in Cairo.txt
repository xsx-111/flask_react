Fire in Cairo Lyrics
Slowly fading blue, the eastern hollows
Catch the dying sun, the nighttime follows
Silence and black mirror pool
Mirrors a lonely place where I meet you

See your head in the fading light
And through the dark your eyes shine bright

And burn like fire, burn like fire in Cairo
And burn like fire, burn like fire in Cairo

Shifting crimson veil, silken hips
Slide under my hand, sullen lips
Whisper my name and I yearn
You take me in your arms, start to burn

F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O

Then the heat disappears and the mirage fades away

F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O, oh, oh

Burn like fire, burn like fire in Cairo
Burn like a fire in Cairo, burn like a
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Blaze like a fire in Cairo, blaze like
Fire, fire, fire, fire, flare
Burn like fire, burn like fire in Cairo4Embed
