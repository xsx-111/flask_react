Accuracy Lyrics
Cherish this moment, feel safe

We sit in the same room, side by side
I give you the wrong lines, feed you

Accuracy
Accuracy

Look into my eyes, we both smile
Can kill you without trying

That's accuracy
Accuracy
Accuracy

An observer's refrain

Accuracy
Accuracy
Practice all day for accuracy
Mirror, mirror on the wall2Embed
