All right
The sun came up
The sun came out
The sun did us in
The sun came out and tore us up
It ripped the shit out of our behinds
And we drove home on towels
Off the heat of the seats
With sand in our teeth
All right, all right
Float on the ocean
Float on the sea
Float on the ocean
(Float, float, the sun )
Lie on the ocean
Float on the ocean
It's all right
Down on the sea
Lie on the ocean
Float on the ocean
(Floater) 
(Gone) 
Gone, yeah 
... The breeze 
... Clouds 
Lie on the ocean
Lie on the sea
Lie on the ocean
Water and wave under
So what?
Down
(Down, down, down)
Lie on the ocean
(Down on the ocean)
Down on the sea
(Down on the sea)
Lie on the ocean
(Lie on the ocean)
Down on the sea
(Down on the sea)
Not brave but
We're down for the count
All rightEmbed
