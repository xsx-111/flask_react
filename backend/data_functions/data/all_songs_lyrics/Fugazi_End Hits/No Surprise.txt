No Surprise LyricsHey
What's your name?
Do you feel the same
Way too?
Siphon fuel, don't make a sound
And most of all, don't let me down
(It comes as no surprise)
(Comes as no surprise)
(Comes as no surprise)
We're destabilized
Hey
Lock eyes, shared plan
No CIA
Could understand
Defile, define
Critique and salve
(It comes as no surprise)
(Comes as no surprise)
(Comes as no surprise)
We're destabilized
(Comes as no surprise)
(Comes as no surprise)
(Comes as no surprise)
No CIA
No NSA
No NSA
Check it out, yeah
Critique and salve me baby
(Comes as no surprise)
No CIA
(Comes as no surprise)
No NSA
(Comes as no surprise)
No satellite
Destabilized
(Comes as no surprise)
No CIA
(Comes as no surprise)
No NSA
(Comes as no surprise)
Could map our veins1Embed
