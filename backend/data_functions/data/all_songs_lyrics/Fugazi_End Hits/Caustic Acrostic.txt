Caustic Acrostic LyricsLights out
For the cynical sharps
For their wide-eyed foils
And all attendant props
Supporters of flash
And pan-fried fucks
Who Grease like cops
Throwing round their body weight and
I feel dangerous and vexed
Swinging two ton second guess
And every motion just cuts too cruel
(Too cruel, too cruel)
And the implication's
That you're implicated
Like a caustic acrostic
Spelling out your name
Lights out
Cause I can see in the dark
Sidewind
My way to the mark of
Fuse lines
Gas-wet for a spark
I crash, I burn, I've fully lost it anyway
I feel dangerous and vexed
Swinging two ton second guess
And every motion just cuts too cruel
(Too cruel, too cruel)
And the implication's
That you're implicated
Like a caustic acrostic
Spelling out your name
And you're nowhere
Lights out loserEmbed
