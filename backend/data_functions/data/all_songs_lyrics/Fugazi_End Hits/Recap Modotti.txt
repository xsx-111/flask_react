Recap Modotti LyricsRecap in taxi
No clothes, no food
Take care of the children
We'll send for you soon
Alien
You find you feel at home
Everywhere
You'll get by
With so much less than anyone
Deceived
Entrapment through belief
Disclosure would decree
Accusations would be shed
Instead
We stand over the dead
The vultures all well fed
The killer running free
Outside the window
The passing night sky
Fills with people I know
Taking me
