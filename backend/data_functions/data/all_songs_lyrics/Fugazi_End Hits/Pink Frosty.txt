Pink Frosty LyricsAnimosities and apologies
Back and forth
We struggle, falter, refrain
With glue and string and deciphering
We try, try, try
To stay together
Despite the pain
It's not our first time through
Nor our Waterloo
Back and forth
From situation
We move to episode
But if we can find
Some peace of mind
Intertwined
The delivery
Is worth
The load
But if we can find
Some peace of mind
Intertwined
The delivery
Is worth
The loadEmbed
