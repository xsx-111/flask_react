Closed Captioned LyricsYour etiquette
Your rules of interaction
What are you waiting for?
Nobody's home
We're all out trying to find one
What are we waiting for?
The recipe, a clear connection
The time, the time, the time, the time
The time, the direction
We just want... we don't know
This one wants the art
This one wants the politic
Everybody wants their own damn station
If we're so fine
Maybe you can tell me why
No one counts until they're dead
I asked you, I asked you a question
I just want... I don't know
The imperfections are here to find
If your position is so unkind
Everything is not all right
And since we live in present tense
The only hope of making sense
All depends on the source of light
Everything is
Closed captioned
Come on
So come on
So comeEmbed
