Guilford Fall LyricsDown at the station
We question our rations
Guess you're satisfied
With the little received
Down at the station
We question our rations
Guess you're satisfied
With the little received
Fractured appetite
With Bismuth Pink on tap
Ascetic limbs gone tight
And your lips are clamped
Your lips are clamped and grey
T-I-N-Y (T-I-N-Y)
Crash your appetite
Erasing every mark you make
Standing in the corner while you're working up your mantra
Derail the train, the train, derail the train
(The train, the train, the train)
Take the time to hesitate
While what's glistenin' on your plate
Goes dry and cold, not in your mouth
T-I-N-Y-A-P-P-E-T-I-T-E
Alright, you see your programmatic mind
Surrenders appetite, surrenders appetite
And you crash on yourself
Snakes ingest 40 times their body weight
But you, you emaciate
You crash your shit all over the place
Such a tragic mind
You crash your shit into shock
Snakes ingesting your body weight all over the place
Snakes ingest over forty times their body weight now
Open your mouth!Embed
