Place Position LyricsAll origins are
Accidental
You've got no papers and no roads lead home
Anymore
Chance is the root of
Place position
All maps are random, my scales are wrong
Hang on
Legal, illegal
Legal, illegal
No passion for the difference
Legal, illegal
Legal, illegal
False premise forge the nation
May all your borders be porous
Free transmission
Smear genetics, c'est la vie
Yawn yawn yawn
I can't stifle my
Yawn yawn yawn
I can't stifle my
Yawn yawn yawn
I can't stifle my
Yawn yawn yawn
I can't stifle my boredom
Yawn yawn yawn
I can't stifle my
Yawn yawn yawn
I can't stifle my
Yawn yawn yawn
I can't stifle my boredom
So why not act your age
Fear of contagion
The violence of a fence builder's dream
That masks the phrasing
Of "all the pleasures of home"
Legal, illegal
Legal, illegal
Legal, illegal
Legal, illegal
Legal, illegal
Legal, illegal
I want to go homeEmbed
