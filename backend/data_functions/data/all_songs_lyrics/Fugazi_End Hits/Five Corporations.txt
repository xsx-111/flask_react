Five Corporations LyricsMoves so slowly
Grows so smoothly
Takes so neatly
It's as if they belong
And they've been here all along
Grows so smoothly
Moves so slowly
Takes completely
It's as if they belong
And they've been here all along
This one's ours
Lets take another
This one's ours
Lets take another
This one's ours
Lets take another
This one's ours
Lets take another
Check the math here
Check in ten years
Clusterfuck theory
Buy them up and shut them down
Then repeat in every town
Every town will be the same
This one's ours
Lets take another
This one's ours
Lets take another
This one's ours
Lets take another
This one's ours
Lets take another
This one's ours
Lets take another
This one's ours
Lets take another
This one's ours
Lets take another
This one's ours
Lets take another
Five corporations
Five corporations
Five corporations
