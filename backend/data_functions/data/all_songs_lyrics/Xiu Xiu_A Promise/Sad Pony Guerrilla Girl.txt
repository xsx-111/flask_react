Sad Pony Guerrilla Girl Lyrics
You say I am loca
Because I am your girl
You say I am stupid
Because I am your girl

You leave me out on the steps
You dress me up like a boy
You say that I am your secret love
You say to be quiet but I want to tell the whole world

I like my neighborhood
I like my gun
Drive in my little car
I am your girl and I will protect you
I like my neighborhood
I like my gun
Drive in my little car
I am your girl and I will protect you

We do it in the back of our little car
Pull up my pants and fix my bra
Go on home, go home to your kids
I'm not going to be quiet and I'm going to tell the whole block
I like my neighborhood
I like my gun
Drive in my little car
I am your girl and I will protect you
I like my neighborhood
I like my gun
Drive in my little car
I am your girl and I will protect you
I like my neighborhood
I like my gun
Drive in my little car
I am your girl and I will protect you6Embed
