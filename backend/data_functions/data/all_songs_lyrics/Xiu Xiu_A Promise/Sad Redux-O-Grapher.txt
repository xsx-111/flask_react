Sad Redux-O-Grapher LyricsHe talked to me like I was smart
He sexed me up all the time
I did not get it
Was this my time to shine?
I did not get it
Had my luck finally turned?
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
I saved up to take him out at night
He said the restaurant was all wrong
He said he had a dream about me
In that dream I was beautiful
I made him a present
It was a photograph of me
I did not get it
He said it did not cost me anything
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la laEmbed
