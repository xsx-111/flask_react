Walnut House LyricsThink about it before you spray paint
"Don't worry, mom"
On the dumpster of the nursing home
They have as many eyes as a pineapple
I am the dumbest bitch on the planet
On the second floor landing, sweating buckets
My arm pits are like black moons
Shaking at the end of a cord
My leather daddy dancing very near
Like a sweetheart would
Hurting my butthole
Like a sweetheart would
Oh, oh, it's little titmouse
Ah, ah, little chickadee
Oh, ooh, it's little ruddy duck
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom
Don't worry, mom1Embed
