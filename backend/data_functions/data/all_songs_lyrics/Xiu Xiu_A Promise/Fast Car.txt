Fast Car LyricsYou've got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
We'll make something
Myself, I got nothing to prove
You've got a fast car
I've got a plan to get us out of here
Working at East Side's San Jose Child Development Center
I've managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with prescription drugs and that's the way it is
His body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
Somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit life and that's what I did
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
I remember we were driving
Driving in your car
The speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
The city lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone
Be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still don't have a job
And I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs
I remember we were driving
Driving in your car
The speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
The city lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone
Be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out late drinking at the bar
You see your friends more than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Maybe together, you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
I remember we were driving
Driving in your car
The speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
The city lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone
Be someone
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough that we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way1Embed
