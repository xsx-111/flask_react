Blacks LyricsI've got only one bra to my name
He said it's alright
Did he hear that?
Did he hear it?
That's enough
That's enough of even trying
That's enough
Oh, I wish it didn't matter
He told his son
He wants to kill himself
He said it's alright
I have had enough of this life
That's enough
That's enough of even trying
That's enough
Oh, I wish it didn't matter
That's enough
That's enough of even trying
That's enough
Oh, I wish it didn't matter
That's enough
That's enough of even trying
Did he hear that?
Did he hear it?
I have had enough of this life
I have had enough of this life1Embed
