20,000 Deaths for Eidelyn Gonzales, 20,000 Deaths for Jamie Peterson LyricsAwful is all
Awful like cookie
Sour and ringing
And lost to this world
These are the times
I should shut up about Iris and Oly
He didn't know how else to be
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Cherry, oh Cherry
While your friend killed her baby
Cherry, oh Cherry
I am at your command
Cherry, oh Cherry
While your friend killed her baby
Cherry, oh Cherry
I am at your command
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot
Hmm hmm, hoot hoot1Embed
