Pink City LyricsAnthony Loyd cops horse like a reporter
A two hour plane trip from his life's work
His most important story
Sound is faster in water than it is in air
A hydrophone will let you know faster
That your grandma and your niece are shot dead
There's a call at tonight's last hour
A bitter pill you've got to swallow
It unravels like an affair
Your only chance to leave Boogie Town
Sound is faster in water than it is in air
A hydrophone will let you know faster
That your grandma and your niece are shot dead
All my life in the pink cityEmbed
