Brooklyn Dodgers LyricsSorry I walked away
When you told me what you were scared of
The night that you turned 12
Trying not to cry in front of your older brother
He knows where I live
He's not interested
I can't have nice things
Like a boy who stays around
When I needed him the most
On your walk
Hold your head up high
High, high, high
Brooklyn dodger
And when you watch me fall
Please look back for the last time
Brooklyn dodger
On your walk
Hold your head up high
High, high, high
Brooklyn dodger
And when you watch me fall
Please look back for the last time
Brooklyn dodgerEmbed
