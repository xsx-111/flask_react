Finer Things / Tamahagene Lyrics

Just want the finer things

Committed grimy street crimes
If nabbed homie, you don't know me, deny me three times
I'm going to the forest to pray
Temptation's racing, hoping this make it harder to stray

I stole from Peter, never paid Paul
I pocket profit on corners, wavin' that 8 ball
For a few that's the cue, they stumblin' son
For the thrill, fistful of bills, I'm crumblin' some
Say goodnight at first light, know when bundle was done
Got beef? You ain't coming with none if ain't come with a gun
Ay young, you ain't come with a gun if ain't come with a drum
For a friend of me, I'm public enemy, and come with a ton (uzi)
I come with a ton (that uzi)
Villainous monsters, feeling accomplished
Stealin' from paupers, illin' from Tilden to Gompers
Dream to push something mean, drive off with dimes
'Til that day I pack a tray, the sidewalk is mines
Just another predator deadin' the smug competitor
Cold hogs before I show love - vetted it
Those that pump meds bump heads, for knots
Streets need a procedure for the bloodshed to stop
In the hood only violence understood, so it's gotta be
Years wasting central potential, no one was proud of me
Plans to change that but the strange fact
Crews that move white soon lose sight of where the reigns at
They say it's royal in my blood
They say it's royal in my blood
They say it's royal in my blood, toyed with mentally for centuries
Not toilin' the mud, the luck of most
Was not to survive them fuckin' boats
On the land of mother's coast
Shoulda been cuttin' throats
Like the clans in Japan, when Kublai came
Splash on the surface with passionate purpose in lieu of the fame
Committed grimy street crimes
If nabbed homie, you don't know me, deny me three times
I'm going to the forest to pray
Temptation's racing, hoping this make it harder to stray
Harder to stray

Bequeath the speech, where's the fee to reach
Scrapin' math never late from class, the streets to teach
This is coke and herb spoken word
What you folks observe is what brokeness spurred
Illest notes emerge, still the most preferred
Get poked and purged where the cope was merged
All focused on them hopeless curbs
Got bread? We pull the heat, toast is served
Want it last? Never flash cash, show reserve
In front of them triggers figures get exposed as herbs
Streets made me EKG, hearts are tested
What I weep is too deep to chart domestic
It's fantastic handcrafted artisan brew
Was casted and mastered for a marvelous few
Truly there's beauty in this ugly
Scared to put seeds in the uterus that love me
Growing, knowing my roots indeed rotten
Producing bad fruits, all my family tree's dropping
Committed grimy street crimes
If nabbed homie, you don't know me, deny me three times
I'm going to the forest to pray
Temptation's racing, hoping this make it harder to stray

I want the finer things
I did it all for the finer things
The finer things
I did it all for the finer things


When heaven is about to confer a great office on anyone, it first exercises his mind with suffering, it exposes his body to hunger and subjects him to extreme poverty, and it confounds his undertakings.  In all these ways, it stimulates his mind, hardens his nature and supplies his incompetencies

Gotta walk this plight
Drop gems, got friends every walk of life
Instigator, said fuck all that talking, fight
In my park all bark, we was forced to bite
Fought the best, any less though light shit
Cold since they left that hole with the ice pick
Hearts don't flutter in the gutter, hate necessary
Propped in a rock in a hard place pressed very
If no jewels can't use, ain't worth the time
All the sounds I 'cord down, urge to climb
Motion picture scripture, every song scored
They want grief, unsheath the long sword
It's hindsight of the fights I've endured
In my twilight, getting right with the lord
Getting right with the lord
In my twilight, getting right with the lord
Got the gift and the thoughts that count
It's the thoughts that count
Got the gift and the thoughts that count
Got the thoughts that count1Embed
