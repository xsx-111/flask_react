Illicit Fields Lyrics

Did a crisp one-two, never had a wish come true
Opt for knocks, can't fix or undo
A pound a gauge, I was reppin' the 'ville
Around the age when your records get sealed
Food determined my mood, never expected a meal
In the hustle muscles played out, respect's in steel
The larger the caliber the harder the traveler
Place merch' on your earth, one part inhabited
Applauded my raw that's why I'm sport baggin' her
Pitch fam, bring your hitman, I'm all Hagler
Hard as novelist carving this marvelous
If not they lovin' this, the governors pardon us
Many living firm got written a prison term
Harsher sentences, word - live and learn
Used to tag on the rag, glad I ain't get the germ
Despite tests, some night sweats a bit concerned
Don't be scared of me, I know the real's rare to see
A square is what you peers appear to be
Those that show smarts want no parts of my cohorts
Loaded pros expose your whole farce

Whip baking skill to make a mil'
Risk a thou', shoot the llamas
No futures promised, just for now
Wild out here in the illicit fields
You either grippin' steel or missin' meals
Hate's well known
Since young I feel this shit
Born with a snub
It's that love I'm unfamiliar with
Arrive would drive still alive with fresh motor
If K round the playground, recess over
Go for mine since the time cord was twined
Call for book, it's off the hook open line
Virtually so thirsty my eyes watered
Served on curbs where they bought it, no gods lorded
I wrote flesh, sold death is morbid
Was on the scene, you only seen what press reported
I roam, park is home far from safe haven
Walk with grace on my waist, the face raven
Of course they aim for a safety, let it flight
Masada whores stay from broad day to deader night

Whip baking skill to make a mil'
Risk a thou', shoot the llamas
No futures promised, just for now
Wild out here in the illicit fields
You either grippin' steel or missin' meals
Hate's well known
Since young I feel this shit
Born with a snub
It's that love I'm unfamiliar with

Hate's well known
It's that love I'm unfamiliar with
Hate's well known
I've been bitter tainted
Coming from the pen of some random warrior

Some time to get acquainted
Some time to get acquainted
It's that fly shit ain't itEmbed
