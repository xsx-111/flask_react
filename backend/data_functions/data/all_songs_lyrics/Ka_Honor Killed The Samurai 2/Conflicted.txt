Conflicted Lyrics
These were known as samurai
Always been conflicted
Always been conflicted

I strained to obtain so I could give more
Most dangerous when there was nothin' to live for
For that fetti bag, ready to let the six pour
Was on nothin' long enough, need a big score
The harmony dreamin' had me constantly schemin'
Rarely peace, and barely a beast, armed like a demon
Singin' tough upbringin', swore it was the hardest
A lot of years starvin', before I was a artist
When bringin' tomorrow the sorrow plus the hurt
We finally eatin', reapin', it's just dessert
It's just, so trust my work from dusk to dirt
Committed rhymes, if you give it time, much is learned
Firm dense, but earn strength with a young store
Brought hammers to grammar school - hence the gun talk
The coke drought made it a cesspool
What they ail is steel, need a fresh jewel
Enthralled in crime not more but nah less cruel
Attractive street where active eat the less drool
I speak brass tacks to my last acts
My gift might be missed if mixed with trash raps
The nights whole, slice your loaf if you ain't breakin' bread
Some hate wait and beg, we take instead
Mommy told me, "Be a good boy
Need you alive, please survive, you my hood joy"
Pops told me, "Stay strapped, son
You need the shotty, be a body or catch one"
Always been conflicted
Always been conflicted
Always been conflicted
Always been conflicted

Where you from? During what years?
You from the slum, where you was upstairs?
What you seen? What you been through?
Where your team? What your men do?
In over your head, who gon' defend you?
Who gon' defend you?
Demonstrative, get you popped where the monsters live
Your people pay for your mistakes, hope they comp' your wiz
From honor, I don't speak drama I don't know about
I hold the pen, ain't goin' know how it was going out
Not blessed, divine, want to live good the rest are mine
Fly rewards for my recordings, don't stress the shine
Wrote the screenplay, direct, and set design
They writin' deadlines, I ain't pressed for time
That haste makes waste, you saunder and slip
But I find when formin' a script, let's ponder a bit
Mommy told me, "Be a good boy
Need you alive, please survive, you my hood joy"
Pops told me, "Stay strapped, son
You need the shotty, be a body or catch one"
Always been conflicted
Always been conflicted
Always been conflicted
Always been conflicted

Always been conflicted
I got my good from mom duke
I got my math from pop duke, for real
Conflicted
Always been conflicted3Embed
