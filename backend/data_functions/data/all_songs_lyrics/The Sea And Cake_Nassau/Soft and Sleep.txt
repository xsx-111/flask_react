Soft and Sleep LyricsThe shoulder as I'm trying to go on
Hello to the sleepy ones
Hello to the soft and floaty
The stars wasted jam on
The shoulder as I'm trying to go home
Hello to the sleepy ones
Hello to the soft and floaty
The stars all dance away still
Well I'm some with a beauty
Fell on a place quite just to suit me
Collar's around my neck be wrong, be wrong, be wrong
And so with the foxglove eyes yeah
Takes some dreaming alive get it wrong
So bruised in December
Still dreaming alive
One glove's went away
Still dreaming alive
Better talk than the damned to sing
With this version always talk and resist
Ah, the sweet's within
Be wrong and you'll take the sign
So we'll stay stillEmbed
