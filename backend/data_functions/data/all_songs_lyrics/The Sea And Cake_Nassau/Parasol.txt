Parasol LyricsParasol
Well I lost some standing still
Talked it up and down the night
Drinking less from floating I don't care
Let's go anywhere
Preciously I don't whisper right
I don't miss that night after all
So it's possible I am the ghost of this
We are the barely slighted
Real on time lay rest the sugar
Lay rest the holiday
Lay rest the parasol
Would I care to take the hills
Shape the water really have some
Let's have them tell us all
It's a chance I wouldn't take
Please stay light
Turn around just remember
Lay rest the sugar lay rest the holiday
Lay rest the parasol
As a calling so amaze me
So it leaves me every day
Well I never be the same
But I'm yours today
Real on time real on time
Lay rest the sugar lay rest the holiday
Lay rest the parasol
Well I lost some yeahEmbed
