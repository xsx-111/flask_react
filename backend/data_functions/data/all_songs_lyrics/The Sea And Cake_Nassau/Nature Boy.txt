Nature Boy LyricsSome play in the sun you're breathless
You're laughing
Rain is salt it's matchless
Stay on into the sun
It passes on
Came on into the sun
We lost we lost your name
We don't knot tied up and down
Knots tied up and down
Prickly right after sleep
Breathless here false of bloom
Throw me into the sun
I'm in love with the sun
Up and down I should care
When I'm into the sun
Here comes the reddening
Watching all of the blooms
Would I lie what's your name
What's your name
I built this song
Sleeping under a low bridge
Breathing a truck passes by
Several coins in my homely pocket
Some brave some not
I should care
Soft spoken disagreeable
Another shift rolling passes
I count the hours on my watch
Ah here comes the reddeningEmbed
