The Cantina LyricsWatered down tonight
Did you say
Even hands
Wear it thin
Lesson one
I really don't need it
Keep it clean
Watered down tonight bound
Torn like I used to
Better lefty driver
Better lefty driver
Chases me
Around the lock
I didn't see it
I didn't try
Pretty Hollywood rivals
The fancy style they're all torn
Anyway hang with the river
Wear it thin
Hang with the river
Let's dry out
I really don't need it
They're so charming
Well I'm torn what you said
Well I'm torn lesson one
Keep it warm
Well I'm torn
Well I'm torn
One could say busted out biting through
Like I could like I could like I could
Well I'm torn
Well I'm tornEmbed
