Alone, For the Moment LyricsChase on chase on
Too sad to lie
Chooses only chooses only
Talk it up to me
Better lost some burnished
Some angle care left some still trying
Just to suit me I had it before
When you're running so
Reason tell me just to suit me
Back fall
Real torn better lesson
Better laugh it out
And down this song came
Anyway I'm burnished
This song I'm burnishedEmbed
