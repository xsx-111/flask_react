To Lick Your Boots LyricsMiss O’Malley didn’t mean what she said
Got a heart, but a head full of lead
She can dream, but she never can do it
You’re alright and you’re gonna get through it
People spend their days trying to find new ways
To put you down all over town
But they’re not fit to lick your boots
Nothing harder to watch than an Englishman
Trying to cry, even if he can
He can dream, but he never can do it
Saying you, you’re the one that blew it
People spend their days trying to find new ways
To put you down all over town
But they’re not fit to lick your boots
People spend their days trying to find new ways
To put you down all over town
But they’re not fit to lick your bootsEmbed
