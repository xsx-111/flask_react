Dust of Ages LyricsThis is the day
That I give myself up cold
The dust of ages
Settles on your days
And so you shake your coat off
And get on your way
Bloodshot and trembling
A new day has begun
The dust of ages
Settles on your days
And you blow it all away
And get on your way
The dust of ages
Settles on your days
But I'm not fuckin' around anymore
I'm on my wayEmbed
