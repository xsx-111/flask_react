Old Shit/New Shit LyricsEveryone loves you
Nobody cares
An awful collection
Of enemies and friends
Congratulations to you
With sad regrets
I'm tired of the old shit
Let the new shit begin
The psychic pain
Of living in this world
It's overwhelming me
Again and again
A beautiful afternoon
Inside you in your bed
I'm tired of the old shit
Let the new shit begin
Nobody loves you
Everyone cares
None of them know what's
Coming 'round the bend
Congratulations to me
Many happy returns
I'm tired of the old shit
Let the new shit beginEmbed
