Losing Streak LyricsWas I wrong about the world?
It's a beautiful new place
Where else could a creep like me
Meet such a pretty face?
Meeting every day with the rising sun
Looking up it's looking like
My losing streak is done
Used to always feel like
Wished that I was dressed better
Never had a lot of luck
Until I finally met her
Feeling like the weight that weighed a ton
Lifted off my shoulders now
My losing streak is done
Always felt like giving in
To the feeling I can't win
But I took it on the chin
Now I'm finally cashing in
Meeting every day with the rising sun
Looking up it's looking like
My losing streak is done
My losing streak is done
I said my losing streak is done
Did you hear me?
I said my losing streak is doneEmbed
