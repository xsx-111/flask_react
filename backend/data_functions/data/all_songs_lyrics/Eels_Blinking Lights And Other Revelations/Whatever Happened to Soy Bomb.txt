Whatever Happened to Soy Bomb Lyrics
Blue light is flickering
Through the city streets
One billion TV sets
Glowing off concrete

One day closer to death
I know that I don't have too long
Whatever happened to Soy Bomb?

Lunch box collector loves
All the pussycats
But when he goes to bed
He wonders where he's at

Thrift store shirts and old haircuts
Living in an old sitcom
Whatever happened to Soy Bomb?

The day is coming
When you'll have to think of it
Was it really worth it
All that shit?
Blue light is flickering
Though the cloudy sky
One billion lonely hearts
Beat until they die

One day closer to death
I know that I don't have too long
Whatever happened to Soy Bomb?Embed
