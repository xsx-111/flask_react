The Stars Shine in the Sky Tonight LyricsI can't live in a world
That you have left behind
Seen a lot, been through too much
But this is where I draw the line
It's not where you're coming from
It's where you're going to
And I just wanna go with you
December is a lonely month
In a year of lonely days
It's hard to tell which way is up
Or down or out or through the haze
People cheat and people lie
While you just watch it all go by
Counting days until you die
The stars shine in the sky tonight
Like a path beyond the grave
When you wish upon that star
There's two of us you need to save
It's not where you're coming from
It's where you're going to
And I just wanna go with youEmbed
