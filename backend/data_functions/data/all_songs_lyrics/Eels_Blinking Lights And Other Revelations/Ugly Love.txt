Ugly Love LyricsDear cousin, I got your letter
It was more than I thought I deserved
Well, she sounds perfect, all I dream of
And I dream about so much it is absurd
But when I get there and she sees me
I'll be impressed if she does not run screaming
My kind of love is an ugly love
But it's real and it lasts a long, long time
I had a thought while I was sleeping
And I dreamed about a place for us to rest
Eternity under the old oak tree
But I go too far, I guess
Maybe I'll think about tomorrow
And maybe I can get her to stay that long
'Cause my kind of love is an ugly love
But it's real and it lasts a long, long time
And if she finds me so repulsive
She wouldn't be the first to retch
Well, I decided one day long ago
I was never gonna be the greatest catch
And if she cares about the car I drive
Then she can get in hers the moment I arrive
'Cause my kind of love is an ugly love
But it's real and it lasts a long, long time
My kind of love is an ugly love
But it's real and it lasts a long, long timeEmbed
