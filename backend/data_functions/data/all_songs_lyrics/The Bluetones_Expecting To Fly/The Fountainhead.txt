The Fountainhead LyricsGod knows I've tried to bridge the gap
I've tried to be me and time after time I've lied
Just to say the things you wanted to hear
Look, look what I've done, look what I do
I'm starting to pull myself through
Hell could feasibly freeze
But in your eyes I'll always be
The fountainhead
The boy whose thoughts keep running away
And you know I'm right
Wasn't it you who said
That when looking to open the eyes in my head
And now I can see from your mistakes
You're as blind as me
God knows I've tried, god knows I try
To be something more than I am
Hell could feasibly freeze
But in your eyes I'll always be
The fountainhead
The boy whose thoughts keep running away
And you know I'm right
What can I say about being profound?
It's a game that we play it goes round and around
I shall stick to the rules but I won't suffer fools
And I won't lose the plot and I won't lose my cool
Can't you see what I've done, can't you see what I do
It's not really unique and it's hopelessly crude
But these are my decisions, these are my mistakes
And I'll fall down again if that's what it takes1Embed
