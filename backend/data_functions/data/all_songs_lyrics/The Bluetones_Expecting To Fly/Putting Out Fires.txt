Putting Out Fires LyricsIf we put our heads together, I think we can salvage it
If we ride the stormy weather, will we really benefit?
Is there anything left to save now anyway?
When you're near my heart beats quicker, faster
It's your skin as pale as alabaster
It has to be, it has to end
Losing a lover, gaining a friend
Yesterday your virtue inspired me
And yesterday you ignited the flames that burnt inside of me
So why, when I wake up, today are the ashes about us?
Now I've lost the strength to crush a flower
And now I grow weaker with the passing hours
You once was the fire, you once was the glow
I was so sure then, and now I don't know
I've wasted time away
But I think that it's okay 'cause
I've wasted time away with you, with you
Now look what we've built together, we didn't waste anything
We've built a fire that burns too strong to die
Or am I a liar who smothers the flames?
When you're near my heart beats quicker, faster
It's your skin as pale as alabaster
It has to be, it has to end
Losing a lover, lying to a friend
I've wasted time away
But I think that it's okay 'cause
I've wasted time away with you, with you
I've wasted time away
But I think that it's okay 'cause
I've wasted time away with you, with youEmbed
