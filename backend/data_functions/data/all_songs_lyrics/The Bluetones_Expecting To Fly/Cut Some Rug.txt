Cut Some Rug LyricsSeems like you're always a million miles away
As far as I'm concerned that's where you can stay
But all the time I'm reminded
Used to be a time we had a lot in common
But now as far as I can see you've got something coming
And all the time you're behind me
And all the time you remind me
Of blitzkrieg and the doodlebug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say I can talk to you any time
But I just wanna cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And say that I can talk, any time
It's easy living in a bubble
No complication or trouble
But it's hard to have responsibility
And judging by you, a personality
And all the time you remind me
Of blitzkrieg and the doodlebug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say I can talk to you any time
But I just wanna cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And say that I can talk, any time
And all the time you remind me
Of blitzkrieg and the doodlebug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say. I can talk to you any time
But I just wanna cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And say that I can talk you any time
I can talk to you any time
But I just wanna cut some rug
Of blitzkrieg and the doodlebug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say. I can talk to you any time
But I just wanna cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
You say that I can talk, any time
Any time, any time, any timeEmbed
