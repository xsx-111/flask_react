Vampire LyricsYou left me unguided
You left me divided
With room to complain
So I’ll say in this song
The wait is too long
I thought I had seen it
I thought I had learned
There’s something around each
Corner I turn
Can’t stay still forever
Got to get it together
If you’d seen with these eyes
And lived with these lies
I thought about farther
And I thought about here
And I knew that this wasn’t for me
Now the beast can subside
A boy needn’t hide
Oh, if you’d seen with these eyes
Never dares to slow, on and on she goes
Knowing what she knows, nothing
Never dares to slow, on and on she goes
Knowing what she knows
Major’s whipping boy, facing one old toy
Distance through the void, nothingEmbed
