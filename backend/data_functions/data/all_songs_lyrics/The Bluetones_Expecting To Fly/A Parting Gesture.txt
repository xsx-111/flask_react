A Parting Gesture LyricsIf you go away then
Don't you come back round here no more
And if you make the move then
Don't expect to come home to an open door
I'm not the same person I was a year ago
You cut me deeply and the scars still show
You've walked between the raindrops for far too long
You're gonna get what's yours
And if you go away then
Don't you come back round here no more
I'm not the same person I was a year ago
You cut me deeply and the scars still show
I'm not the same person I was a year ago
You cut me deeply and the scars still show, yeah
You make me act like a fool over you
And now you drive me away
You make me act like a fool over you
And now you drive me away
You make me act like a fool over you
And now you drive me away, yeah
And now you drive me awayEmbed
