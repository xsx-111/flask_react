Talking To Clarry LyricsI don't have to be feeling down to speak of you
But I'll visit you not only when I'm feeling blue
You make me happy when I was happy to start with
You make my life so precious and so easy to part with
Life rolls along and teaches us nothing
So why am I still around waiting for something?
Do you have the answers to all of my questions?
Maybe not, but I'd like to hear your suggestions
Talk to me, you don't talk to me
Talk to me, you don't talk to me
People in corridors
People in doorways
People wherever I turn
So many people round out the shadows
So many people to learn
And to burn, burn
Communication is burned
I can't understand a word
Though there's nothing to be heard
It's all gone quite absurd
Communication is blurred
I can't understand a word
Though there's nothing to be heard
It's all gone quite absurd
Communication is blurred
I can't understand a word
Though there's nothing to be heard
It's all gone, all gone quite absurdEmbed
