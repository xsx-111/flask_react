Carnt Be Trusted LyricsWho is she to say you carnt be trusted?
And come to think of it, how does she know?
Her doubt is just her faith in disappointment
She can't be blamed if she decides to go
Her dignity is what makes her an angel
You know she needs it more than she needs you
It doesn't pay to take these things for granted
Something which you always seem to do
You always seem to do
But she just wants to spend some time with you
Just a minute, or just a moment
Just long enough to throw one clean punch
Now you've reached the point where she sees through you
Your low-esteem and lack of self-control
Everything she had she handed to you
And what she didn't give you, you stole
You couldn't have so you stole
Sometimes I stop to question it all
Must I look at the stars and live in the dirt?
When all I have to show for my doubt is a blow to the lip
And some blood on my shirtEmbed
