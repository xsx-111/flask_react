Time & Again LyricsNothing I can do could ever bring those feelings back
I've taken everything my body is a bloated sack
The days behind me start rolling into months
Is time running out?
My head feels too heavy
My legs feel too weak
All I can do now is sleep
Everything is empty now, the things I knew are gone
Darkness lays dormant now a colour once shone
Compromise my conscience just to get me through the day
Is this my reward?
And I'm going on journeys
I'm exhausting my muse
I'm taking from everything
To see what I can use
If I found a brand new colour
Something no-one had ever seen
I dug it up right there in my garden
That would be the greatest thing
Nothing I can do could ever bring those feelings back
I've taken everything my body is a bloated sack
The days behind me start rolling into months
Is time running out?
And faced with having to
Have and then lose
I'd choose never to have had, yeah
If I found a brand new colour
Something no-one had ever seen
I dug it up right there in my garden
That would be the greatest thing
I only want to speak to you
I only want to let you know
That time and again my feelings
Never seem to show
If I found a brand new colour
Something no-one had ever seen
I dug it up right there in my garden
That would be the greatest thing
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and againEmbed
