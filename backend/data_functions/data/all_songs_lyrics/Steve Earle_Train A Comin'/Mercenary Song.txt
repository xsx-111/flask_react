Mercenary Song Lyrics
Me and old Bill there, we both come from Georgia
Met Hank out in New Mexico
We're bound for Duranqo to join Pancho Villa
We hear that he's paying in gold
I guess a man's got to do what he's best at
Ain't found nothing better so far
Been called mercenaries and men with no country
Just soldiers in search of a war

And we're bound for the border, we're soldiers of fortune
Well, we'll fight for no country, but we'll die for good pay
Under the flag of the greenback dollar
Or the peso down Mexico way

When this war is over might go back to Georgia
And settle down quiet somewhere
I'll most likely pack up and head south for Chile
Heard tell of some trouble down there

And we're bound for the border, we're soldiers of fortune
Well, we'll fight for no country, but we'll die for good pay
Under the flag of the greenback dollar
Or the peso down Mexico way
And we're bound for the border, we're soldiers of fortune
We'll fight for no country, but we'll die for good pay
Under the flag of the greenback dollar
Or the peso down Mexico way
And we're bound for the border, we're soldiers of fortune
We'll fight for no country, but we'll die for good pay
Under the flag of the greenback dollar
Or the peso down Mexico wayEmbed
