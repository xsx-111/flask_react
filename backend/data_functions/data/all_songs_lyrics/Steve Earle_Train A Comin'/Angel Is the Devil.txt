Angel Is the Devil Lyrics
Everybody call her angel
She's no stranger to the devil I know
His mark is on her body
His fire's burning in her soul
When we're making love
He's laughing at us down below
She's the devil I know

She's the devil I know
She's the devil I know
Said she come from heaven
My angel is the devil I know
She's the devil I know

Now she's the kind of woman
Keep you coming back for more
Got the kind of face
You swear you seen someplace before
Well, it could've been your mama
Could've been a Mexican whore
She's the devil I know

She's the devil I know
She's the devil I know
Said she come from heaven
My angel is the devil I know
She's the devil I know
Now she'd drag you straight to hell
I can tell, I think I'll just go
Yeah, the devil sent her here
To deliver me body and soul
Yeah, and every inch she drags me down
I'm closer to the glow
She's the devil I know

She's the devil I know
She's the devil I know
Said she come from heaven
My angel is the devil I know
She's the devil I know
Devil I know
She's the devil I know
Said she come from heaven
My angel is the devil I know
She's the devil I knowEmbed
