Hometown Blues Lyrics
I wish I'd never come back home
It don't feel right since I've been grown
I can't find any of my old friends hanging around
Won't nothing bring you down like your hometown

I spent some time in New Orleans
I had to live on rice and beans
I hitched through Texas when the sun was beating down
Won't nothing bring you down like your hometown

Home is where the heart is
Ain't that what they always say?
My heart lies in broken pieces
Scattered along the way

So don't think about me when I'm gone
I don't mind traveling alone
You are the sweetest little thing that I ever found
Won't nothing bring you down like your hometown

Home is where the heart is
Ain't that what they always say?
My heart lies in broken pieces
Scattered along the way
So don't think about me when I'm gone
I don't mind traveling alone
You are the sweetest little thing that I ever found
Won't nothing bring you down like your hometown
Sugar, won't nothing bring you down like your hometownEmbed
