Mystery Train Part II LyricsThere's a train a comin'
There's a train a comin'
Hear them tracks a-hummin'
There's a train a comin'
Can't you hear her blowing?
Can't you hear her blowing?
Wonder where she's going
Can't you hear her blowing?
Run down to the station
Run down to the station
Dread and fascination
Run down to the station
Don't you want to ride her?
Don't you want to ride her?
Wonder what's inside her
Don't you want to ride her?
She ain't bound for nowhere
She ain't bound for nowhere
Engineer just don't care
She ain't bound for nowhere
She run down the mountain
She run down the mountain
She won't even slow down
Mmm, down the mountain
There's a train a coming
There's a train a coming
Wait till you hear her humming
There's a train a comingEmbed
