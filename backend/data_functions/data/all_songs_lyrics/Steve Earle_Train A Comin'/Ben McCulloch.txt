Ben McCulloch LyricsWe signed up in San Antone, my brother Paul and me
To fight with Ben McCulloch and the Texas infantry
Well the poster said we'd get a uniform and seven bucks a week
The best rations in the Army and a rifle we could keep
When I first laid eyes on the General, I knew he was a fighting man
He was every inch a soldier, every word was his command
His eyes were cold as the lead and steel forged into tools of war
He took the lives of many and the souls of many more
Well they marched us to Missouri and we hardly stopped for rest
Then he made this speech and said, "We're coming to the test"
Well we've got to take Saint Louis, boys, before the Yankees do
If we control the Mississippi, then the Federals are through
Well they told us that our enemy would all be dressed in blue
They forgot about the winter's cold and the cursed fever too
My brother died at Wilson's Creek and, Lord, I seen him fall
We fell back to the Boston Mountains in the North of Arkansas
Goddamn you, Ben McCulloch
I hate you more than any other man alive
And when you die
You'll be a foot soldier just like me in the Devil's infantry
And on the way to Fayetteville, we cursed McCulloch's name
And mourned the dead that we'd left behind and we was carrying the lame
I killed a boy the other night who'd never even shaved
I don't even know what I'm fighting for, I ain't never owned a slave
So I snuck out of camp
And then I heard the news next night
The Yankees won the battle
And McCulloch lost his life, yeah
Goddamn you, Ben McCulloch
I hate you more than any other man alive
And when you die
You'll be a foot soldier just like me in the Devil's infantry2Embed
