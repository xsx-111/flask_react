Goodbye Lyrics
I remember holding on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there, I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high?
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like a soft breeze blowing up from the Caribbean
Most Novembers, I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
That's one place I'll never go in my life again
Was I off somewhere maybe just too high?
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I can't remember if we said goodbye
Goodbye, goodbyeEmbed
