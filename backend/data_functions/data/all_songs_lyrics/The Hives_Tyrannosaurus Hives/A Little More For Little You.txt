A Little More For Little You Lyrics
You'll never get it right
They got a hundred lies for you
And when they pass them out
You got to give or take a few
And be just the same
A head in the crowd but behind the game
Oh well, you never can tell

You're such a clever kid
But I see what's wrong with you
It's all you ever did
Take lies and believe them true
Knew it all along
Another act and a truth gone wrong
Oh no, it ain't my Hollywood

I went on strike when the union said "I would"
Had a sign in my hand 'cause the times were no good
All this time all they ever told me to
Was get a little lie to ring a little true
I went on strike when the union said "I would"
Had a sign in my hand 'cause the times were no good
All this time all they ever told me to
Was to get a little more for your little you
And maybe you're alright
And maybe I don't have a clue
Yeah, maybe black is white
And maybe black is white too
But it's all the same
You don't get the picture, you're getting framed
You took the bait and now it's too late

You didn't turn out right
Just look at you
You had the biggest plans
But no way to carry through
It was all an act
And now you can't stick to the facts
Oh no, but it ain't my Hollywood

I went on strike when the union said "I would"
Had a sign in my hand 'cause the times were no good
All this time all they ever told me to
Was get a little lie to ring a little true
You spent your time just like they said you should
Now those marks on your face just don't look any good
And all this time all they ever told me to
Was to get a little more for your little you
Ahh, (Said "I would")
(No good)
(Told me to)
(Little true)
(Said "I would")
(No good)
(Told me to)
It ain't my HollywoodEmbed
