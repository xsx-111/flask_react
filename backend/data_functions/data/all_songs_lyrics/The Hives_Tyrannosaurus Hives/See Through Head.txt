See Through Head Lyrics
I know what you're thinking
You got a mind and it's stinking
You know why?
You got a transparent cranium, a see through head

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It doesn't mean a thing
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It's just a paper ring
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I said it doesn't mean a thing
I got thoughts in my head and I'm ready to sting
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And no-o-o-o-ow you come my way
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I-I-I-I-I spot you from a mile away
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
So now you come my way
I got cutlery, got napkin, saltshaker, pepperspray

You got a head
Gets you ahead
You got a head
A see through head full of ... Whoo!
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You thought you had it made
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whining and dining paid
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You thought you had it made
You wanna cut a piece of cake you gotta have a bit of blade
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm not so easily led
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You pick up but the line is dead
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm not so easily led
You always end up losing 'cause you got a see through head

You got a head
Gets you ahead
You got a head
A see through head full of ...

Oh, it doesn't matter
It's you, yeah, you
It's you, yeah, you
It's you, yeah, you
It's you, just you
It's you and your see through head
You got a head
Gets you ahead
A see through head full of ...
You got a head
Gets you ahead
You got a head
A see through head full of ...Embed
