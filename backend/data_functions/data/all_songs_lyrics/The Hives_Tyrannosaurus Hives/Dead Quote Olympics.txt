Dead Quote Olympics Lyrics
The Dead Quote Olympics
The Dead Quote Olympics
The Dead Quote Olympics
The Dead Quote Olympics

Can't make an omelette without breaking an egg
And I can't make a headache if I don't aim at the head
You had enough of their thoughts, have your own
Then you wouldn't have to be such a clone
That just won't get you nowhere, you thought it would?
The Dead Quote Olympics (it's on)
The Dead Quote Olympics (you won)
The Dead Quote Olympics (I'm done)
The Dead Quote Olympics

This time you've really got something, it's such a clever idea
But it doesn't mean it's good 'cause you found it at the library
Yes they were smart but they are dead
And you're repeating all that they said
You know it don't make you clever like you thought it would

The Dead Quote Olympics (it's on)
The Dead Quote Olympics (you won)
The Dead Quote Olympics (I'm done)
The Dead Quote Olympics
You didn't read between the lines so it won't do you any good, it's true
The Dead Quote Olympics
And that moment that you live for, it doesn't live for you
The Dead Quote Olympics
When weekends set standard and pace
We are all showered in books and berets
And that will just get us nowhere, who thought it would?

The Dead Quote Olympics (it's on)
The Dead Quote Olympics (you won)
The Dead Quote Olympics (I'm done)
The Dead Quote Olympics
The Dead Quote Olympics (it's on)
The Dead Quote Olympics (you won)
The Dead Quote Olympics (I'm done)
