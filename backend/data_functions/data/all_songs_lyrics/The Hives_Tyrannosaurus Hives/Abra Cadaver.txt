Abra Cadaver Lyrics
Ah, know what's wrong with me? (Aye!)
I got no vision see (Aye!)
I was the target of a notion of submission see (Aye!)
Oh yeah they needed me (Aye!)
Yeah I was the target see (Aye!)
They tried to stick a dead body inside of me (Aye!)

I need no need no alibi
Honestly, I tell no lies
Wanted to stick an office worker inside of me
But I kept breaking free (Aye!)
They could not capture me (Aye!)
I pulled maneuvers that were closer to savage see (Aye!)

Bad! Bad!
They tried to stick a dead body inside of me
Bad! Bad!
Come again, I tell no lies

So now you understand (Aye!)
I was a wanted man (Aye!)
The opposition and the bug of a shiny hand (Aye!)
But ah, no this I see: (Aye!)
There's nothing wrong with me (Aye!)
There's no deadbeat regime rider inside of me (Aye!)
I need no need no alibi
Honestly, I tell no lies
Tried to stick an office worker inside of me
I need no need no alibi
Honestly, I tell no lies
Wanted nothing stuck in me

Bad! Bad!
They tried to stick a dead body inside of me
Bad! Bad!
Wanted nothing stuck in meEmbed
