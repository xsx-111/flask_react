B Is For Brutus Lyrics
Hear them saying that a lot's a lot
You think that is all that matters?
You've done your math well
You've checked the figures
You've done your math, tell
Who is the bigger man
Can't explain it but you've got a hunch
Well, that's always something
Climb up the ladder, step up a notch
Climb up the ladder, can you see what you got?

But if you do it, do it good, Brutus
Real good, like a little man should

Did your homework and you worked the mob
Because it’s all you can do
Tried for a lot still, you have a little
Whatever happened, mister?
You couldn’t figure, out of the rut
Still you can’t get it right
Can’t get a lot for a little?
You keep trying, ended up in the middle
Had an enigma, ended up with a riddle
But if you do it, do it good, Brutus
Real good, like a little man should

Rewind and look at what you got
An ambition but you lost the plot
Judas, Brutus, Quisling, Time has come to do
What's expected of you

Real good
Like a little man shouldEmbed
