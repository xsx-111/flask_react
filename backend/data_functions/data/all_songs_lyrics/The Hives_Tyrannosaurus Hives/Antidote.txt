Antidote Lyrics
Bitter taste
In your mouth
It's too late
To get it out
Everytime
I'm around
You try to leave but
I'll be standing in your way

You want antidote
I got the poison
You want antidote
I got the poison

Second try
To say goodbye
Kick this habit but
I'll be standing in your way

You want antidote
I got the poison
You want antidote
I got the poison
You want antidote
I got the poison
You want antidote
I got the poison
You want antidote
I got the poison
You want antidote
I got the poison1Embed
