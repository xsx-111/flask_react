No Pun Intended Lyrics
So you look for authenticity
But I can see what is bothering me
The kind you want from long way back in time
It's been disposable since '79

I never wanted this to end
Good with transmission but too lazy to send
Not going down no in no history
You're going down because of me

A lot of cause to be alarmed
A solid chance of an incoming harm
Put up with me or I put you away
So I ask what have we learned here today

I never wanted it to stop
So I gave notice and I moved to the top
Your opinion never weighed a ton
And your talking never hurt anyone

And now it's time to see
What you get from me
But full understanding can't be guaranteed
You say we had our fill
But I move for the kill
I keep on doing it till I get everybody everywhere
People are people and they're never scared away
I say
Ten dead but no pun!
So you look for authenticity
Only to find what you wanted in me
You had a function long long time ago
Had a function but the thinking was slow

I never wanted this to end
Good with transmission but too lazy to send
Not going down no in no history
You're going down because of meEmbed
