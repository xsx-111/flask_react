Walk Idiot Walk Lyrics
OOOOOWW!!

Well is it true what they say about it?
They say it's new but I have to doubt it
And then they tell you everything about it
Had enough
I got some people saying this way
I got some people saying that way
I got some people saying there's no way
Ain't it tough

See the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
See the idiot chalk up his name on the blackboard
See the robot walk
See the robot talk
See the robot write up his name on the ballot

They say, "this is all I need to get by"
The truth is, baby, it's a lie

Well, is it true what they say about it?
You oughta do what I do and doubt it
He won and now he's gonna do something about it
Ain't it sad?
And if you don't wanna feel like a putz
Collect the clues and connect the dots
You'll see the pattern that is bursting your bubble
And it's bad
See the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
See the idiot chalk up his name on the blackboard

They say, "this is all i need to get by"
The truth is, baby, it's a lie
Its a
Its a lie-ie-ie-ie-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

This is what it boils down to

If you review the winning combination
Body at work and a mind on vacation
Who had the brain where it started to sink in?
It was you

You've seen the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
But you never learned nothing and nothing isn't over
See the robot walk
See the robot talk
Still you never learned nothing and nothing isn't over
They say, "this is all I need to get by"
The truth is baby it's a lie1Embed
