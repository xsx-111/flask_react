Love in Plaster Lyrics
I really thought that we had something moving faster
Than love in plaster
I really thought that we had something growing stronger
But it grew no longer
I thought this time
Yeah!

I really thought that we had something set in motion
More than a vowed devotion
I really thought that we had something out of the ordinary
More than stationary

I thought this time
What we had you and I

Said I'm losing my mind
I got bit all the time
And I'm better off dead
'Cause it was all in my head
Now it's all lost
And it's gone
Don't I know it
I really thought, that we, had something, more than a bore
I really thought that we had something more than a violation
Of my imagination

I thought this time
What we had you and I

Said I'm losing my mind
I got bit all the time
And I'm better off dead
'Cause it was all in my head
Now it's all lost and it's gone
Don't I know it
And I'm better off dead

I really thought it would work out
I learned it couldn't 'cause somehow
We couldn't get along
We wouldn't get along
A little something on the side
Would make your life feel more worthwhile
You think I won't be long
You couldn't be more wrong
I thought this time
What we had you and I

Said I'm losing my mind
I got bit all the time
And I'm better off dead
'Cause it was all in my head
I said I'm losing my mind
I got bit all the time
And I'm better off dead
'Cause it was all in my head
Now it's all lost and it's gone
Don't I know itEmbed
