Assault And Battery / The Golden Void LyricsAssault and Battery

Lives of great men all remind us
We may make our lives sublime
And departing leave behind us
Footprints in the sands of time
Of hewn stones the sacred circle
Where the wizard sages sat
Let us try to remember
All the times where they were at

So your thoughts, they were expecting
Assault and battery on the human anatomy
Assault and battery on the human anatomy, man

Lives of great men all remind us
We may make our lives sublime
And departing leave behind us
Footprints in the sands of time

So your thoughts, they were expecting
Assault and battery on the human anatomy
Assault and battery on the human anatomy, man

Lives of great men all remind us
We may make our lives sublime
And departing leave behind us
Footprints in the sands of time
Of hewn stones the sacred circle
Where the wizard sages sat
Let us try to remember
All the times where they were at

So your thoughts, they were expecting
Assault and battery on the human anatomy
Assault and battery on the human anatomy, man
The Golden Void

The Golden Void speaks to me
Denying my reality
I lose my body, lose my mind
I blow like wind, flow like wine
Down a corridor of flame
Will I fly so high again
Is there something wrong with me
I cannot hear, I cannot see
Down a corridor of flame
Down a corridor of flame
Down a corridor of flame
Down a corridor of flame
So you think the time is past
The life you lead will always last
Chaotic fusion's of your soul
Down below that rocky knoll
Through the clouds an open sky
The wind flows through your watering eyes
The sounds are pitched to draw you
On your never ending journey
On the edge of time
The edge of time
The edge of timeEmbed
