Dying Seas LyricsWe've flotsam been, and the jetsam
In highness being, gonna get some
On the water walking, it's easy to be
Centralised then into infinity
For ourselves only have we to thank
To fool you now would be to walk the plank
Eternity to spend in mime
Drowning in the dying seas of time
With galleon astral, sail is set
And with the tide we sail her yet
By light propelled, Karma our guide
The shores spatial pass we beside
Past rotting hulks of culture drifting
Lost souls ghostly trawl nets lifting
Themselves against the man-made crime
Drowning in the dying seas of timeEmbed
