The Wizard Blew His Horn LyricsThe Great Hound barked
And the world turned white
The Great Hound sighed
And the forest died
The Wizard blew his horn
The Wizard blew his horn
The snow snake hissed
And the world turned round
The snow snake grinned
In his fine cold sin
When the Wizard blew his horn
The Wizard blew his horn
The horse wept blood
And the earth did groan
The tall horse reared
From a lake of tears
To seek a Champion
To seek a Champion
The world was bleak
And the Earth did fear
The Wizard's horn
Of magic born
So it screamed for a champion
It screamed for a champion
The eagle laughed
And the world grew black
It stretched giant claws
And it snatched the Law
And the Champion stirred in sleep
The Champion stirred in sleep
Champion
Champion
ChampionEmbed
