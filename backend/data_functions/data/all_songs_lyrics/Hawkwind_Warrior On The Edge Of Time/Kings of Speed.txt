Kings of Speed LyricsKings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speed
Kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speed
Between you and me, Mr C
I think we have what we both need
Step this way lads, it ain't no lie
Try your luck and maybe hit the sky
Kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speed
Kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speed
You're gonna get a tasty trip
On Frank and Beasley's rocket ship
The biggest attraction, the brightest star
Boys, you're going fast and far
Kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speed
Kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speed
Kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speed
Kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speed
We guarantee the sweetest ride
You'll go so far you'll think you've died
Step this way lads, it ain't no lie
Try your luck and reach the sky
Kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speed
Kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speed
Kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna make you kings of speedEmbed
