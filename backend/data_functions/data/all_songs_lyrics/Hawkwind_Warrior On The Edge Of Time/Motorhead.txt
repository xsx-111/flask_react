Motorhead LyricsSunrise wrong side of another day
Sky-high and six thousand miles away
Don't know how long I've been awake
Wound up in an amazing state
Can't get enough and you know its righteous stuff
Goes up like prices at Christmas
Motorhead
You can call me Motorhead alright
Braindead total amnesia
Get some mental anaesthesia
Don't move, I'll shut the door and kill the lights
I guess I'll see ya all on the ice
All good clean fun, have another stick of gum
Man you look better already
Motorhead
You can call me Motorhead, alright
Fourth day, five day marathon
We're moving like a parallelogram
Don't move, I'll shut the door and kill the lights
If I can't be wrong, I must be right
I should be tired, and all I am is wired
Ain't felt this good for an hour
Motorhead
You can call me Motorhead, all nightEmbed
