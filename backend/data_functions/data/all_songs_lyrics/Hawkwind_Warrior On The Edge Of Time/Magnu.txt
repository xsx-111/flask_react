Magnu LyricsMagnu, horse with golden mane
I want your help yet once again
Walk not the earth but fly through space
As lightning flash or thunders race
Swift as the arrow from the bow
Come to me so that no one can know
Sunbeams are my shafts to kill
All men who dare imagine ill
Deceit that fears the light of day
Fly from the glory of my ray
Good minds open and take new light
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
A burning brand was seen to fall
It lit the darkness of the hall
The flying hoofbeats circling in
Come to me and let us spin
Sunbeams are my shafts to kill
All men who dare imagine ill
Deceit that fears the light of day
Fly from the glory of my ray
Good minds open and take new light
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
Reign of night
Reign of night
Reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
Until diminished by the reign of night
