Standing at the Edge LyricsWe're standing on the edge
On the edge of time
On the edge of time
And it is dark
It is dark
It is dark
It is dark, so dark on the edge of time
And we're tired of making love
We are the lost
We are the ravaged
We are the unkind
We are the soldiers at the edge of time
And we're tired of making love
Where are our children?
Where are our fathers?
Where is desire?
It is cold, so cold on the edge of time
Where is our joy?
Where is our hope?
Where is our fire?
It is cold, so cold on the edge of time
We are the lost
We are the forgotten
We are the undying
We are the soldiers at the edge of time
The veterans of a thousand psychic wars
We are the soldiers at the edge of time
The victims of the savage truth
We are the soldiers at the edge of time
And we're tired
We're tired
We're tired
We're tired
We're tired
We're tired of making loveEmbed
