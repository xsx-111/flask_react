United Lyrics
Look around
They're movin' in
Hold the ground
When they begin
We can do it
We can do it
And if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here

Gonna keep on driving
Never stop

United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all

So give me hope
Don't give in
Make a stand
We're gonna win
We can do it
We can do it
And if they wanna they can try it
But they'll never get near
And they can get out of here

Gonna keep on driving
Never stop

United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all

So give me hope

United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
