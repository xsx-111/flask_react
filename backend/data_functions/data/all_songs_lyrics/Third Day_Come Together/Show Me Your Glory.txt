Show Me Your Glory Lyrics
I caught a glimpse of Your splendor
In the corner of my eye
The most beautiful thing I've ever seen
And it was like a flash of lightnin'
Reflected off the sky
And I know I'll never be the sa-ame

Show me Your glory
Send down Your presence
I want to see Your fa-a-ace
Show me Your glory
Majesty shines about You
I can't go on without You, Lo-ord

When I climb down the mountain
And get back to my life
I won't settle for ordinary things
I'm gonna follow You forever
And for all of my days
I won't rest 'til I see You aga-ain

Show me Your glory
(Show me Your glory)
Send down Your presence
I want to see Your fa-a-ace
Show me Your glory
(Show me Your glory)
Majesty shines about You
I can't go on without You, Lord
Lo-ord
Show me Your glory
(Show me Your glory)
Send down Your presence
I want to see Your fa-a-ace
Show me Your glory
(Show me Your glory)
Majesty shines about You
I can't go on without You, Lord

Show me Your glo-o-ory
Show me Your glory, Lord
I can't live without You
Oh noEmbed
