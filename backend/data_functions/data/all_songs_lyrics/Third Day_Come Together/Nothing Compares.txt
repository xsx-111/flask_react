Nothing Compares Lyrics
I've heard all the stories
I've seen all the signs
Witnessed all the glory
Tasted all that's fi-ine

Nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lord, oh no
Nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lo-o-ord
Oh no

I see all the people
Wasting all their time
Building up their riches
For a life that's fi-ine

Nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lo-ord, oh no-o
Nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lo-o-ord
Oh no
And I find myself just living for today
'Cause I don't know what
Tomorrow's gonna bring
So now matter if I rise or fall
I'll never be alone, oh no-o
My Lord

Nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lo-o-ord, oh no
Nothing compa-ares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lo-o-ord
Oh no

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
To the greatness of knowing You, Lord, oh no-o-o
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares to You
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to You, Lord
To you
Nothing compares to You, Lord
Nothing compares, nothing compares
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to You, Lord
Oh no
Wo-o-oah
Nothing compares to You, no
Woah, woahEmbed
