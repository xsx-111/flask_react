Bullet Train to Vegas LyricsWe'll ride the bullet train to Vegas
The minute that we blow this burg
Just as far as it'll take us
Pay the man and ride the turd
Sopping wet, stinking drunk
We'll bob for tokens up and down
Pull up a tit and suck away
Gonna milk that sacred cow
Now, now, now, now
(I can't wait to come home)
We'll ride the bullet train to Vegas
The minute that we blow this burg
Just as far as it'll take us
Pay the man and ride the turd
Sopping wet, stinking drunk
We'll bob for tokens up and down
Pull up a tit and suck away
Gonna milk that sacred cow
Now, now, now, now
(I can't wait to come home)Embed
