Super Unison LyricsReady ready to let you in
Up with the mob
Ready ready to let you in
Up with the mob
It ain't no accident that
We're better off
You're set to inherit
What I got
You put a nail in my hands
You put a nail in my hands
Ready ready to let you in
Ready ready to let you in
Ready ready to let you in
Ready ready to LET YOU IN!
Yeah keep the herd in check
Or be absorbed, that's all, that's all
Yeah that'll happen next
And who'll be there to write you off
What's left intact
Better pollute that mind
Slip with the masses
Slip with the mass!
Maybe I've been cloned
Don't let that man inside your home
Wasn't me that phoned
Don't let that man inside your home
Wasn't me that phoned...Embed
