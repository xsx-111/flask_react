New Math LyricsI’d stoop to that
Sure I would
I’d stoop to that
Sure I would
Yeah, you’ve been had!
Yeah, you’ve been had!
Yeah, you’ve been had!
Yeah, you’ve been had!
I know it now
You know
You know it all right
That’s how I got my job at the underwriter’s lab
That's how I threw a wrench in everything I had a chance to
That’s how I fixed it
You ought to know
That’s how I fixed it
Somehow you’re the last to know
I’d stoop to that
Sure I would
I’d stoop to that
Sure I would
Yeah, you’ve been had!
Yeah, you’ve been had!
Yeah, you’ve been had!
Yeah, you’ve been had!
I know it now
You know
You know it all right
My knees are spotless and my legs are crossed
And I needn’t spread them
Cause I can afford
Piety, chastity, charity, your company
I know it now
You know
Yep
That’s how I got my job at the underwriter’s lab
That's how I threw a wrench in everything I had a chance to
That’s how I fixed it
That’s what I did
That’s how I fixed it
That’s what I did
That’s how I lost my job at the underwriter’s lab
That's how I threw a wrench in everything I had a
That’s how I fixed it
That’s what I did
That’s how I fixed it
That’s what I did1Embed
