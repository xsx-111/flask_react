Sinews (original version) LyricsFound yourself an asshole
Find yourself the door
Ain't gonna fix your leaks for you
Ain't gonna watch the store
Every last string and gut pulled apart and divvied up
My share
Trash man (etc.)
Found yourself an asshole
Knew you could afford
Keep your handouts - cup cake -
Find yourself the doorEmbed
