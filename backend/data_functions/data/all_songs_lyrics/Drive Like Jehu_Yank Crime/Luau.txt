Luau LyricsFailures in outer space, failures and crimes
Let's get something straight: it's not for mine, mine, mine, mine
Before you were born, after you die
Failures in outer space, failures and crimes
It's in the water, it's in the earth
It's in the unit to measure the curse
Length depth, whatever it's worth
It's in the unit to measure the curse
It's in the setup yeah it's built in
Whatever the get up, yeah it's built in
Wait for the rub-out, wait for the purge
Wipe the last haole the fuck off our turf!
Forget what you thought! Forget what you heard!
Wipe the last haole the fuck off our turf!
Aloha, aloha! Suit up!
Luau, luau! Luau, luau!
Aloha, aloha! Suit up!
Luau, luau! Luau, luau!
Suit up!
Wait til the rub-out, wait for the purge
Forget what you thought! Forget what you heard!
Wipe the last haole the fuck off our turf!
Forget what you thought! Forget what you heard!
It's in the setup yeah it's built in
Whatever the get up, yeah it's built in
Kill all the tourists and we'll all sleep sound
Cash-in their fillings & blow it in town, yeah
We'll blow it on rifles, we'll blow it on drinks
Head in the corner, head in the sink
Aloha, aloha! Suit up!
Luau, luau! Luau, luau!
Aloha, aloha! Suit up!
Luau, luau! Luau, luau!
Suit up!Embed
