Sinews LyricsFound yourself an asshole
Find yourself the door
Ain't gonna fix your leaks for you
Ain't gonna watch the store no more
Every last string and gut ripped apart and divvied up
My share, my share
My share, my share
Trash man, trash man
My share, my share
Found yourself an asshole
Knew you could afford
Keep your handouts, cup cake
Find yourself the door
Every last string and gut ripped apart and divvied up
My share, my share
My share, my share
Trash man, trash man
My share, my share1Embed
