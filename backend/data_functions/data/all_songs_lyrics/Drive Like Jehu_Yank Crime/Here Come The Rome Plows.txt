Here Come The Rome Plows LyricsSad to say
It's over now
Here come the huns
Pick a side
Pick a spot
Here come, here come
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Cal state
No fun
Stay put
Here come
To clean the slate
To pass the time
To erase
Yank crime
Why waste
Your time
Here come the huns
Be my
Date tonight
Here come, here come
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Cal state
No fun
Stay put man
Here come
Too late
Yank crime
Erase
Yank crime
Yeah we're on
Yeah we're on
Yeah we're on
Yeah we're on
The receiving end
I've never been
Dear heart
Dear friend
I've never been on
The receiving end
I've never been
Not a scratch
Not a dent
I've never been on
The receiving end
I've never been!
I've never been!
I've never been!
Sad to say
It's over now
Here come the huns
Pick a side
Pick a spot
Here come, here come
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Yank crime
Cal state
No fun
Stay put man
Here comes
Yeah we're on
Yeah we're on
Yeah we're on
Yeah we're on
The receiving end
I've never been
Dear heart
Dear friend
I never been on
The receiving end
I've never been
Not a scratch
Not a dent
I've never been on
The receiving end
I've never been!
I've never been!
I've never been!
