Human Interest LyricsYou set it up, you set it right
It's fair enough, alright
If I want a loan, if I wanna trespass
Why should I walk when you've got wheels
When I'm in doubt, when I'm in debt
When I'm in deep at your expense
Then I owe you, I owe you, I owe
I'd never make you suffer, I know that wouldn't do
And that ain't practical, and I ain't through
When what I got needs fixing, when I want something new
I know I'm covered with you
You set it up, you set it right
It's fair enough, alright
If I want a loan, if I wanna trespass
Why should I walk when you've got wheels
When I'm in doubt, when I'm in debt
When I'm in deep at your expense
Then I owe you, I owe you, I owe
I'd never make you suffer, I know that wouldn't do
That ain't practical man, but I ain't through
When what I got needs fixing, when I want something new
I know I'm covered with you
You're my human interestEmbed
