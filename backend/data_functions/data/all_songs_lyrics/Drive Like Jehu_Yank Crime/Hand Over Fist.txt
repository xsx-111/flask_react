Hand Over Fist LyricsThe beating you deserve
Hand over fist
Gonna say it with a smile
Gonna say it with a lisp
Yeah, never gave it up
Man, that ain't good enough
Give em an inch they'll take a mile
Give em an inch they'll take a mile
Give em an inch they'll take a mile
Give em an inch they'll take a mile
The beating you deserve
Hand over fist
Gonna say it with a smile
Gonna say it with a lisp
Yeah, never gave it up
Man, that ain't good enough
Give em an inch they'll take a mile
Give em an inch they'll take a mile
Give em an inch they'll take a mile
Give em an inch they'll take a mileEmbed
