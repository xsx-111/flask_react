Do You Compute LyricsDo you compute? Do you compute?
Do you or don't you?
I think you do
Don't need it proven
Don't wanna listen
Don't need a tour of the pieces I'm missing
Do you compute? Do you compute?
Do you or don't you?
I think you do
As if you were put here to straighten us out
And everything you said was being written down
You weren't and it isn't and nobody's listening
And nobody gives a fuck what you go do with your lifeEmbed
