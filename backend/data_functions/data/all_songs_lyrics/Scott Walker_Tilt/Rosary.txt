Rosary Lyrics
I'll string along
I'll string along
Ooh, wauu, wauu, wauu
Come morning, my beads on a face
A thread, a thong
Ooh, wauu, wauu, wauu

We can save it, we can change it
Put it in lines across the room
But we'll never stop it bristling

And I gotta quit

With a ribbonless hair
With a wire of snare
Ooh, wauu, wauu, wauu
With all the trembling vein
That you can bear
Ooh, wauu, wauu, wauu

We can save it, we can change it
Put it in lines across the room
But we'll never stop it pimpling
And I gotta quit

Scrape a little pattern to a sty
I kiss holes for the bullets
In case of thigh
In case of thigh
I kiss holes for the bullets

And I gotta quit
And I gotta quitEmbed
