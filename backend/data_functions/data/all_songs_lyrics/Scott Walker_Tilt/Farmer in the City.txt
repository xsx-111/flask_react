Farmer in the City Lyrics
Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 21
Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 21

This night you are mistaken
I'm a farmer in the city
Dark farm houses 'gainst the sky
Every night I must wonder why
Harness on the left nail
Keeps wrinkling, wrinkling
Then higher above me
E e e so o o
Can't go by a man  from Rio
Go by a man from Vigo
Can't go by a man  from Ostia
Hey, Ninetto
Remember that dream?
We talked about it so many times

Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 21
Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 21
And if I'm not mistaken
We can search from farm to farm
Dark farm houses 'gainst our eyes
Every night I must realize
Harness on the left nail
Keeps withering and withering
Then higher above me
E e e so o o
Can't go by a man in this shirt
Go by a man in that shirt
Can't go by a man with brain grass
Go by his long long eye gas
And I used to be a citizen
And I never felt the pressure
I knew nothing of the horses
Nothing of the thresher
Paolo, take me with you?
It was the journey of a life

Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 21
Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 215Embed
