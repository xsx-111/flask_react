Manhattan Lyrics
Here you are boy
Here you are
Here you are boy
Here you are
Here you are boy
Here you are

I tip to Bengal
Tip to Somal
I tip to Burmese
Tip Kenyanese
See them sliding through the sun
I tip Havanian
Abyssinian
Here Alaskan
Here Corsican
See them sliding through the sun
It's on me all my life
On me all my life

Scalper in the lampglow
Scalper on a chair
Stick wiped shirt?
And his arm somewhere
Fleur de Lis
Le wrist is connected
Chief of police
A la collar - bones disconnected
Here you are boy
Here you are
Here you are boy
Here you are
Here you are boy
And hear the word of the Lord

I tip to Bengal
No, he tips to Bengal
Tips to Somal
Tips to Burmese
Tips Kenyanese
See them sliding through the sun

Scalper in the lampglow
Scalper everywhere
Stick wiped shirt?
Say something round that shredded dirt
Say, Fleur de Lis
Le jaw bone connected
Chief of police
A la ankles - connected
Here you are boy
Here you are
Here you are boy
Here you are

He tips Havanian
Abyssinian
Here Alaskan
Here Corsican
We tip to RussoEmbed
