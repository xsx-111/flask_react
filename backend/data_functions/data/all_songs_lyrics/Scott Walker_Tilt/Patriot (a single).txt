Patriot (a single) Lyrics
Ja '91'
See how they run
I brought nylons
From New York
Some had butterflies
Some had flecks
I brought nylons
From New York
Hard flat butterflies
Some had specks

The good news
You cannot refuse
The bad news
Is there is no news

Tonight he'll rise
He'll sell his arms
To anyone
Who asks about
As-in-the wind
As-in the rain
As-in-as in
As-in-without
Oh, the Luzerner Zeitung
The Luzerner Zeitung
Oh, the Luzerner Zeitung
And you never sold out
And you never sold out

Cripple fingers
Hit the muezzin yells
Some had Columbine
Some had Flecks
Cripple fingers
Hit the rounds of shells
Some had clinging vine
Some had specks

The good news
You cannot refuse
The bad news
Is there is no news

Tonight he'll rise
He'll leave these arms
To anyone
Who asks about
As-in-the tracks
As-in the wrists
As-in-you been
As-in-without
Oh, the Luzerner Zeitung
Oh, the Luzerner Zeitung
Oh, the Luzerner Zeitung
And you never sold out
And never sold out

See how it blows
A mile up the road
Color of moon
It swirls and collects
Unfolding and tumbling
Up this back road
Swirling butterflies
Swirling flecks
