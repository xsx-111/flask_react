Face on Breast Lyrics
Swan
You glide above the thrashing
Release the catches
Strain your wings behind your back
Paint his eyes
It will never lick those eyes
Smear the mouth
All across the thready sky

I tried to show ya
Ya didn't want to go
Ya know how to whistle
Put ya lips together and blow
That's what it said
That's what it said
That's what it said
Pledging my love
Pledging my love
What if I'm only
If I am only pledging my love
Pledging my love
Pledging my love
What if I'm only
If I am only pledging my love
I tried to show ya
Ya didn't want to go
Ya know how to whistle
Put ya lips together and blow
That's what it said
That's what it said
That's what it said
Pledging my love
Pledging my love
What if I'm only
If I am only pledging my love
Pledging my love
Pledging my love
What if I'm only
If I am only pledging my love

Swan
You glide above the thrashing
Release the catches
Strain your wings behind your back
Paint his eyes
It will never lick those eyes
Smear the mouth
All across the thready skyEmbed
