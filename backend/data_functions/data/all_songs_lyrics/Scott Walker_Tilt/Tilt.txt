Tilt Lyrics
He was so strong
He was so bold
When they made him
They broke the mold
If he heads this way
When the moon is slow
Come over and pray
They'll turn the buffalo
They'll turn the buffalo

There's a need to sleep
In the shag of his stomach
Slide around his eye
With your love in tow
If he heads this way
Don't you say hello
Get out of the way
They'll turn the buffalo
They'll turn the buffalo

Our town, our town
Do love a stampede
Stampede by
My old jacket in the park
Someday I'll pick it up
Look for the label and whisper:
Tilt, ain't got none no no
Tilt, got none at all
Tilt, ain't got none no no
None at all

The mother waits
As still as the moonlight
Standing in long grass
With her cold cold nose
What she feels so deep
She will never show
Baby don't you weep
They'll turn the buffalo
They'll turn the buffalo


Our town, our town
Do love a stampede
Stampede by
My old jacket in the dark
Someday I'll pick it up
Look for the label and whisper:
Tilt, ain't got none no no
Tilt, got none at all
Tilt, ain't got none no no
None at all

He was so strong
He was so... so
We'll think of him
When we get oldEmbed
