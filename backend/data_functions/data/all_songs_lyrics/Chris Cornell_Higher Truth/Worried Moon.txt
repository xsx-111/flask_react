Worried Moon LyricsWorried moon, shining bright
Can I sleep here tonight right beside you?
I got a long way to go
I’ll be off in the morning I hope, but I don’t know
If she would have me back again
Or only want me for a friend
And leave a stain across my heart
That never washes out
Nervous moon, in the clouds
There’s a halo around your proud face
And I’m glad that we’re friends
I might see you again sooner or later I guess
Yeah if it all goes wrong
And I'm a heart without a home
Maybe you can talk me out
Of doing myself in
Worried moon
Im afraid of what’s to come
Worried moon
Yeah tell me what you know
Worried moon
You see further down the road
Worried moon
There you are, looking down
Ill be here on the ground if you need me
Yes I dream of a ghost
Of a love that has died, or maybe not
But it haunts me now
Worried moon
I'm afraid of what’s to come
Worried moon
Yeah tell me what you know
Worried moon
You see further down the road
Worried moon
Looking up, you are gone
I got into the city at midnight
Oh these eyes, looking on
Make me blind and put me down
And the noise just drives me out
Worried moon
I'm afraid of what’s to come
Worried moon
Yeah tell me what you know
Worried moon
You see further down the road
Worried moon
Dirty moon, on the rise
Orange as fire, but bitter cold
You won’t remember me I know
Cuz I have moved to another coast
With a new love to call my own
Maybe one day you can bathe us
In your blue light
Worried moon
