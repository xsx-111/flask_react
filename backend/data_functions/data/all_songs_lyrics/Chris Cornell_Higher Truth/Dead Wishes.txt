Dead Wishes Lyrics
Staring in the mirror with two borrowed eyes
Looking for a part of me that’s still alive
Waiting for my chest to fall and rise
Standing on the corner with my shirt tucked in
Summer turns to autumn, winter turns to spring
And it all flies by like a speeding train

Dead wishes on a broken chain
White roses in a dead man’s dream
Down and out with everything to lose
If these long dead wishes never do come true

Waiting for the night to come and chase away
All the flies hovering around my head
With my memory for a pillow and all my regrets for a bed
Standing on the corner, now I'm past surprise
Yelling out a warning to some passerby
I stand just as God made me and I lie down in disguise

Dead wishes on a burning lake
White roses for my soul to keep
Diving down with everything to win
If my long-since sunken ship ever does come in
Round and round we all fall down
And that's how ancient mountains crumble
Time keeps moving slower
Like falling from the sun
Come and knock me over
I'll keep getting up
Throw a line down to me
Keep hanging on

Standing on the corner don’t apologize
You don't have to bow your head or raise your eyes
Or pretend that you don’t see me

Dead wishes on a broken chain
White roses in a dead man’s dream
Down and out with everything to lose
If these long dead wishes
These long dead wishes never do come true

Round and round we all fall down
And that's how ancient mountains crumble
Round and round we all fall down
And that's how ancient mountains crumble
That's how ancient mountains crumble
That's how ancient mountains crumbleEmbed
