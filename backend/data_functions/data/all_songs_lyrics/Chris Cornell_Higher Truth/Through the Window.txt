Through the Window LyricsClouds have gathered turned to rain
Candle on your sill burned out
Weather on your face
Timed to match the mood outside
Reading the poems that you saved
They make the gloomy hours make sense
Or do they lose their power
With the yellowing of age
I saw you suffering
Through a foggy window in the rain
When you thought no one was watching, yeah
Going through your memories like so many prisons to escape
Become someone else
With another face
And another name
No more suffering
You sold the best of yourself out
On a chain of gray and white light
One syllable at a time
You should have made them pay a higher price
I saw you suffering
Through the cracked and dirty window pane
I was ashamed that I was watching
Going through your imagination
Looking for a life you could create
And become somebody else
With another face
And another name
No more suffering
I wish that I could find a seed and
Plant a tree that grows so high
So that I could climb
And harvest the ripe stars
For you and I to drink and
Spit the ashes from our mouthes
And put the gray back in the clouds
Send them packing without bags
Of old regrets and sorrows
Cuz they donâ€™t do a thing
But drag us down
So far down
The past is like a braided rope
Each moment tightly coiled inside
I saw you suffering
Through the yellow window of the train
With everybody watching, yeah
Too tired for imagining
That you could ever love somebody else
Somewhere far away
From another time
And another place
With another life
And another face
And another name
And another name
No more sufferingEmbed
