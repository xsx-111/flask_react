Bend In the Road LyricsIn a bend in the road
I’m too lost and tired
To see where I’m going
What I left behind
And I’m moving so slow
Don’t know when I’ll arrive
So put a bend in the road
I’m growing tired of straight lines
I set off for the shore
That was far and slipped away
From the ones I adored
And the place I was raised
And I rode down the road
Just to watch it go by
And when and where is love?
Maybe nowhere am I
Everyone needs a touch
Or a shoulder for crying
They say love is a crutch
I say love is blind
And that’s all that she needed
That I could not supply
When a bend in the road
Put it out of my mind
Then a strange little girl
Who was everything I ever dreamed
I could love or be loved by
So put a bridge or a hill
Or a forest of pines
Or a river of blue
I can run along side
I’ll sleep when it’s night
I'll follow the signs
Just put a bend in the road
I’m growing tired of straight lines
Put a bend in the road
I’m growing tired of straight linesEmbed
