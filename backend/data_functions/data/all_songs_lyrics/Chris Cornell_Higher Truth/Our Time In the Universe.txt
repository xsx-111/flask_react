Our Time In the Universe LyricsWaiting upon the dunes of earth and sand
In the morning, the flame appears upon your hand
Swallow the fears of empty-promise hearts
And remember we only just got to the stars
So save the dying arms of midnight
For the patience and a lapse of light
'Cause it’s our time in the universe
Well I don’t mind if we're blessed or cursed
And it’s our time in the universe
Yours and mine
Breathing beneath miles of earth and sky
In the sunlight, I will appear before your eyes
So don’t worry on what tomorrow holds for you
I’ll be waiting at the end of every road you choose
Save the dying arms of midnight
'Cause it’s our time in the universe
Well I don’t mind if we're blessed or cursed
Well it’s our time in the universe
Yours and mine
See you don’t fall, no matter the end
See it unfold, no matter the need
See it fold up, whatever happens to be
It’s what it will be
It’s what it will be
'Cause it’s our time in the universe
Well I don’t mind if we're blessed or cursed
Yeah it’s our time in the universe
Yours and mine
Yours and mine1Embed
