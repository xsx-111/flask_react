Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart Lyrics
Every time I stare into the sun
Trying to find a reason to go on
All I ever get is burned and blind
Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain

When you came along, the time was right
Pulled me like an apple, red and ripe
Wasn't very long, you took a bite
And did me wrong, and it serves me right

And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go round again gain

Every little key unlocks the door
Every little secret has a lie
Try to take a picture of the sun
And it won't help you to see the light

Every little word upon your lips
Makes a little cut where blood pours out
Every little drop of blood, a kiss
That I won't miss, not for anything
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go round again

Every single feeling tells me this is leading
To a heart in broken little pieces
And you know I need this
Like a hole in the head


Every single feeling tells me this is leading
To a heart in broken little pieces
And you know I need this
Like a hole...

And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go round again
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go round again
Here we go round again
Here we go round again
Here we go round again4Embed
