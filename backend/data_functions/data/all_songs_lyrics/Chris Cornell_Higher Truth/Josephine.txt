Josephine LyricsJosephine, where can you be now?
Again the sun is rising on my troubled heart
Don’t deny you know you and I
Are the making of what fate just can’t pull apart
My sweet Josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every kind of love that you will ever need
Dying here on bended knees
Sheets of rain, cold and gray
Run down the page as I write your name
With just the weight of your silence now
Crashing all around me while I screamed it out loud
My sweet Josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every kind of love that you will ever need
Dying here on bended knees
Like a raven in a cage
Blood of my birth just won’t wash away
Like a stitched-together doll
My feet to the flame as I follow the blame
For someone else’s pain
For someone else’s pain
Rivers of black ink flood
A tapestry of flesh and blood around my frame
A living shrine just for you, if you'll be mine
Golden band upon your hand
Leave this endless winter behind
My sweet Josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every single kind of love that you will ever need
Dying here on bended knees
Dying here on bended knees
Dying here on bended knees
