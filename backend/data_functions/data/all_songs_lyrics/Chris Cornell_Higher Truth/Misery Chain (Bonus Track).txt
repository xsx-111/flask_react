Misery Chain (Bonus Track) LyricsWon't you take one link from this misery chain?
Keep it to remind you of a long-forgotten time or a place
So that you recognize its shape when it's near
Any time or place this misery chain should appear
Take the locks and shackles, and melt all of it down
Shine a light upon every shadow, every acre of ground
The hidden corners on in all around
Anywhere you feel this misery chain should be found
When we're gone, and it's all said and done
What will we leave?
Stories told, will they speak of us when God only knows
What those words will be?
And if I should fall from the top of the world
To the depths below, so far below where our belief could exist
Down further still will be the one who hides the key
There to try to put these misery chains on me
When we're gone, and it's all said and done
What will we leave?
Stories told, will they speak of us well?
God only knows what those words will be
Won't you take one link from this misery chain?
Keep it to remind you of a long-forgotten time or a place
So that you recognize it till it's understood
And that every trace of this misery chain is gone for good
Till every trace of this misery chain is gone for goodEmbed
