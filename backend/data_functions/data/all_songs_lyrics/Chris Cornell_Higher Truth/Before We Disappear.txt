Before We Disappear Lyrics
Time ain’t nothing if it ain’t fast
Taking everything that you ever had
And giving nothing in return
But a cold bed in the quiet earth

If there's a door to every cell
A pearl inside of every shell, then

How hard can it be to share your life with me?
How hard can it be to rise with me each morning?
I know that it feels like we will live forever
But I fear that time will hide the years

Life ain’t nothing if it ain’t hard
It’ll show you who you truly are
Knock you down when you get too tall
Till you're spun around in a free fall

But somewhere out there past the storm
Lies the shelter of your heart
So how hard can it be to share your life with me?
How hard can it be to rise with me each morning?
I know that it feels like we will live for ever
But I fear that time can hide the years
Like we were never here
So hold on tightly, my dear

I'm not one to waste my time
Searching for some silver lining
Somewhere out there past the storm
Lies the shelter of your heart

So how hard can it be (how hard) to share your life with me?
How hard can it be to rise with me each morning?
I know that it feels like we will live forever
But I fear that time can hide the years
Like we were never here
So hold on tightly, my dear

Before we disappear
Before we disappear2Embed
