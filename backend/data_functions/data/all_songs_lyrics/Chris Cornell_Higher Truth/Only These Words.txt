Only These Words LyricsIn a castle down a long road
A little girl was born to a king and to a queen
And her mother’s eyes welled up tears of joy
Staring at the tiny face of a miracle she made
She would say I love you
She would say I love you
Summer came and went unrolling
Trees all stripped to the bone
Daddy’s little girl in his arms
Well, they sit upon his throne
Who is that thief hiding in the dark?
Just a little girl who stole his heart
He would say I love you
He would say I love you
He would say I love you
With only these three words repeating
A simple greeting, but it’s all you wanna keep
Clever lips can be misleading
A tongue can fly away, it won’t come back
But it’s only these words we recognize
Six o’clock A.M., the alarm rings out
Awoken from a dream
No more castle down a long road
No more kings and no more queens
But she’s a princess nonetheless
And a handsome prince is what she’ll get
He will say I love you
He will say I love you
He will say I love you
He will say I love you
He will say I love youEmbed
