Wrong Side Lyrics
When I was just a boy of ten
My father met a miner’s death
Trapped inside for twenty nights
No one made it out alive
So there I was alone but free
The master of my destiny
But trouble found me right away
My close companion since that day

And I’m on the side of the road again
I’m on the wrong side, my friend
Whichever way the wind is blowing
No matter where the river bends
I'm on the side of wrong again

At twenty-one, I fell in love
To a girl of sixteen years
But a jealous father ran me down
Left me in the road for dead
So I decided there and then
I’d find the car, I’d take revenge
But the fire caught the house and fields
I haven’t slept a whole night since
And I’m on the side of wrong again
I’m on the wrong side, my friend
Whichever way the wind is blowing
No matter where the river bends
I’m on the side of wrong again
I’m on the side of wrong again

I ran three years, then finally stopped
Cut my hair and found a job
Working in a road café
Sleeping in the parking lot
Late one night, the store was robbed
The owner dead, his boy was shot
And I’m the only one he saw
Now I’m waiting for the trap door to drop

And I’m on the side of wrong again
I’m on the wrong side, my friend
Whichever way the wind is blowing
No matter where the river bends
I’m on the side of wrong again
I’m on the side of wrong again
I’m on the side of wrong againEmbed
