Let Your Eyes Wander LyricsWhen you find love
And it gets away
If it comes back to you
Then it will stay
Well maybe it’s true
As dumb as it sounds
I ain’t gonna stop you
From looking around
So let your eyes wander
Wild and free
Sooner or later
They will look back
To me
Love can be sharp
Make no mistake
Flatter a good heart
Then watch it break
It'll cut you to the bone
Just to see you bleed out
But that isn't me, no
I’m somebody else
So let your eyes wander
The moment you think
You see something better
Better than me
So let your eyes wander
Wander away
And I’ll look no further
You will come back one day
Followed every word that I have ever heard
And I still don’t know what to say
I always think I’m losing
When my lips are moving
Time to shut up anyway
Followed every line
That I remember trying
But they never worked in the end
No more need for talking
If you feel like walking
You’re gonna walk anyway
You’re gonna walk anyway
I know you can tell
The difference between
One lonely tear falling
And a season of rain
So let your eyes wander
Wander away
Your heart is young
And longing to stray
Let your eyes wander
Wild and free
Sooner or later
They will look back
They will look back
They will look back
To meEmbed
