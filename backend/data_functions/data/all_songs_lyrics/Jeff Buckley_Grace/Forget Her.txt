Forget Her Lyrics
While this town is busy sleeping
All the noise has died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
Cause she'll never change her ways

Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her
Ah, my heart feels so still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
Oh, I think I've forgotten her now

Her love is a rose, pale and dying
Dropping her petals in land unknown
All full of wine, the world before her, was sober with no place to go

Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
She's somewhere out there now


Well my tears falling down as I try to forget
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
All of the words, all of her men
All of my pain when I think back to when
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
The smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need
Her again
But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Oh, my heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
She's out there somewhere now

Oh She was heartache from the day that I first met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget you, somehow
Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now8Embed
