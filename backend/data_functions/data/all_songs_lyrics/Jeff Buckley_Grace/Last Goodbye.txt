Last Goodbye Lyrics
This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over, just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for, more than you'll ever know

Well, this is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face?
Why can't we overcome this wall?
Baby, maybe it's just because I didn't know you at all

Kiss me, please kiss me
Kiss me out of desire, baby, not consolation
Oh, you know it makes me so angry cause I know that in time
I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye, ohhh

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Did you say, "No, this can't happen to me!"
Did you rush to the phone to call
Was there a voice unkind
In the back of your mind
Saying maybe
You didn't know him at all
You didn't know him at all, oh oh, ya didn't know
Ooohh, didn't know
Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes
And the memories, offer signs that it's over
It's over17Embed
