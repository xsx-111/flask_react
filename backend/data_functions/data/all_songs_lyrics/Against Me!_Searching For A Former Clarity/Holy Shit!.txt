Holy Shit! Lyrics
I am oh so fascinated
I am oh so entertained
Standing here like a comedian
I repeat what I said, again and again, and again
Until the meaning has become an imitation of itself
An impression of an original defeats the fucking purpose
I don't know where this is going
But it's looking more and more like the same place where we started

Oh good God, holy shit, the joke's on us, not on them
Kids pretending to be astronauts, police officers, and firemen
Oh good God, holy shit, the joke's on us, not on them
Kids pretending to be astronauts, police officers, and firemen

And everybody's watching the lead singer in the bands
The guitars explode into a drumbeat that's driving
It's pretty fucking boring, ah, don't you think?
And of all the things we'd ask
Of all the ways we'd like for it to be
They're just drunken conversations
Song lyrics sung at the top of our lungs so desperately
I believe in a power that is of and by the people
I believe in an art that cannot be compromised
I believe that I will endure, and I will overcome
And I will sing it until I no longer remember the reason
What was that reason?
Oh good God, holy shit, the joke's on us, not on them
Kids pretending to be astronauts, police officers, and firemen
Oh good God, holy shit, the joke's on us, not on them
Kids pretending to be astronauts, police officers, and firemen2Embed
