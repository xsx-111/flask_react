The Future Lyrics
Everything's so unfair, baby
I wish I could be there
Close my eyes and I dream of you
But there's nothing that I can do
Counting memories, passing time
Fighting to keep my hope alive
Close my eyes and I dream of you
But there's nothing that I can do

'Cause I live in the future, future
Too many years apart
I live in the future, future
Far, far

Hiding inside my mind
In a tower no one will climb, baby
I left it far behind
In a world of another kind
Looking out to a single moon
Maybe time will roll over soon
I don't know if this love will last, baby
So far into the past
'Cause I live in the future, future
Too many years apart
I live in the future, future
Far, far

Maybe I made a mistake
Come and save me, I'm floating in space
Farther and farther away
From the point that I wanted to make
All I can do is wait for my ideas to take
I feel so out of place, searching for the answers

Out here in the future, future, yeah, yeah
I live in the future, future
Far, far1Embed
