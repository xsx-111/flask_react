Always Lyrics
Please don't steal my heart
Don't make me start over again
Please don't hurt my pride
Don't make me hide my loving away, away

Lonely, the word rings like a bell
Tolling, from Heaven fell
I always wanted to be a lover
But I can't take the pain
I won't surrender to any other
Ain't it always the same? Hey

How can I ever know what love can truly be?
I want to live alone inside my fantasies
Why can't I turn away? I'm under your persuasion

So, please don't steal my heart
Don't make me start over again
Please don't hurt my pride
Don't make me hide my loving away, away

Hurt me, I will take the blame
Heal me, then say my name
Trust me, this is who I am
Believe me, I want to give you all I can, hey
How can I ever know what love can truly be?
I want to live alone inside my fantasies
Why can't I turn away? I'm under your persuasion

So, please don't steal my heart
Don't make me start over again
Please don't hurt my pride
Don't make me hide my loving away

Unless you love me surely
Unless you love me truly
Maybe then we'll find a way
To stay together always1Embed
