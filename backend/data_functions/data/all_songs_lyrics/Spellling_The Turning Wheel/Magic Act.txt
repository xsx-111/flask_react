Magic Act LyricsBeen working too long, too long, too long
Been working too long, too long, too long
I'm on my way out, way out
I'll go lay down, lay down
Take my body (Take my body)
Make my brain a garden (Body)
Take my body (Take my body)
Make my brain a garden (Body)
Take my body (Take my body)
Make my brain a garden (Body)
Take my body (Take my body)
Make my brain a garden (Body)
Take my body (Take my body)
Make my brain a garden
Take my body (Take my body)
Make my brain a garden1Embed
