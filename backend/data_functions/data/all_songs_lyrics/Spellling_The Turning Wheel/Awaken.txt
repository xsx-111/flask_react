Awaken Lyrics
Holy Father, please awaken your love
Holy Mother, we've forsaken your trust
Do we have the mind to change?
To make it better?
Back down on Earth
Space Command, engage the great return
Back down to Earth

High in a tower we call America
Lightning strike down to our core

All we want is right here
All we need and more
Let your heart surrender
Let your heart transform

Heart of Venus, heal us
Today, tomorrow
Navigator, steer us to our new dawn
Now wе have the sciencе to change
Let's make it better
Back down on Earth
On a satellite, we wait for the great return
Back down to Earth
High in a tower we call America
Lightning strike down to our core

All we want is right here
All we need and more
Let your heart surrender
Let your heart transform

All we want is right here
All we need and more
Let your heart surrender
Let your heart transform1Embed
