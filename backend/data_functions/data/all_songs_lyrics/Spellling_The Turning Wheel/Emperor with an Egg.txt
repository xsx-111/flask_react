Emperor with an Egg LyricsThe emperor with an egg in his feathers
The emperor with his egg, with his treasure
His poetry (Don't let it freeze)
His poetry (Don’t let it freeze)
Oh, the night has teeth
And the wind has teeth
And the ice has teeth
But he won't retreat
He's a bird, he’s a king
He can swim with his wings
Like an arrow
He's a bird, he's a king
He can swim with his wings
Like an arrow
He's a bird, he's a king
He can swim with his wings
Like an arrow
He's a bird, he's a king
He can swim with his wings
Like an arrow
Like this?
I can feel a lеopard seal
Oh, I can feel a leopard seal1Embed
