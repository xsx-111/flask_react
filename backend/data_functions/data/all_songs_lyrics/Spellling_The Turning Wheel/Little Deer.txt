Little Deer Lyrics
Little deer, little deer
The arrow hurts to fly to you
How do I fear, little deer?
To take the precious life from you away (Away)
Moonlight on the secret fate

Little deer, little deer
I see myself inside of you
I'll be right here, little deer
To take all of the pain away, my friend (My friend)
Moonlight on the secret thread

Dead of winter, dead of eve
Little deer will marry me
Tender lovers of the earth
Turn us back into the dirt
Dead of winter, dead of eve
Little deer will marry me
Tender lovers of the earth
Turn us back into the dirt

Little deer, little deer
Run now, run away from me
This world is cruel, and you're no fool
To dancing with reality, my prey
Moonlight on the secret face
Little deer, little deer
Your eyes are wide, your heart is plain
No sin or shame, no age, no name
To write above your holy grave, my angel
Bed of clovers green and sable

Dead of winter, dead of eve
Little deer will marry me
Tender lovers of the earth
Turn us back into the dirt
Dead of winter, dead of eve
Little deer will marry me
Tender lovers of the earth
Turn us back into the dirt
Dead of winter, dead of eve
Little deer will marry me
Tender lovers of the earth
Turn us back into the dirt
Dead of winter, dead of eve
Little deer will marry me
Tender lovers of the earth
Turn us back into the dirt4Embed
