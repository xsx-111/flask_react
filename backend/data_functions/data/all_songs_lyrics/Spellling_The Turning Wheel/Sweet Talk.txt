Sweet Talk LyricsI hear the musical words
I hear the musical words
In the arc of a rainbow
In the spider's harp
Wait for the verses
The colorful voices
Wait for the verses
The colorful voices
Sweet talk, sweet talk
On the telephone, baby
On the microphone, honey
On the radio, gotta hear that sweet talk
Sweet talk, sweet talk
On the telephone, baby
On the microphone, honey
On the radio, gotta hear that sweet talk
