Legacy Lyrics
There's a legacy that I wanna take over
Out of my mind and into the daylight
There's a legacy that I wanna take over
Out of my mind and into the daylight

I draw my sword from the sorrow to fight with destiny
Find out the voice of my father, deep and frightening
It's time to show my face
It's time to make my way
I'll take a leap of faith
I'll take a leap of faith
But first, I'll crawl, I'll crawl
I'll crawl, I'll crawl
I'll crawl, I'll crawl
I'll crawl, I'll crawl

Into the daylight
Into the daylight
Into the daylight
Into the daylight
Into the daylight
Into the daylight
Into the daylight
Into the daylight
Into the daylight
Into the daylight
Into the daylight1Embed
