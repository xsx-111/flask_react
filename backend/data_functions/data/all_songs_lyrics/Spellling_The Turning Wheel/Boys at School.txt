Boys at School Lyrics
Take me to the Lord before the boredom takes me over
I am waiting on his move
I'm going under the floor
What am I waiting for?
Floating down the hall
Through all the voices, through all the walls
Thought you could be the one to set me free
Tomorrow, I turn sixteen years and I don’t want to grow older

I hate the boys at school
They never play the rules
I hate the boys at school
They never play the rules, ooh

The body is the law and I'm only human after all
Wanted to bе the one that you need
Tomorrow, I turn sixteen years and I don't want to grow oldеr
You don’t even know, you don't even bother
You gave me a heartbeat, you gave me a heartbeat
I guess you'll never know
How much this moment means to me
You were the hero on my TV
Tomorrow, I turn sixteen years and I don't want to grow older
You don't even know, you don't even bother
You gave me a heartbeat, you gave me a heartbeat
I hate the boys at school
They never play the rules
I hate the boys at school
They never play the rules

Shut out the Sun until I'm small again
I'm way too tired to climb out of bed
Four walls is all I need of friends
I’m meaner than you think
And I’m not afraid
Of how lonely it's going to be
If I change my mind, I’ll go walking outside
Just to see how the law is in place still3Embed
