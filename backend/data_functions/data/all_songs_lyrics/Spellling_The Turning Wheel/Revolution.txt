Revolution Lyrics
Too far to turn back now
So long, my childish dreams
Look at all my birthday candles, baby
Blow them out
Restless years are travelling
My circle is never completing
Spent all my wishes, damn it, I'm trying
To stay alive

What I want is a fire that never goes out
I’ve got all this desire
In a world of doubt
I'm in a permanent revolution
I'm in a permanent revolution

What a wheeling feeling
When I’m complete
I think I found my way around
This mortal coil
What a wheeling feeling
When I'm complete
I think I found my way around
This mortal coil
What I want is a fire that never goes out
I've got all this desire
In a world of doubt
I'm in a permanent revolution
I'm in a permanent revolution1Embed
