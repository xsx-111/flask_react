Turning Wheel Lyrics
Dancing, we are dancing
Without moving, without moving
Looking glass of glory in our eyes

Lay down all your weapons
We don't have to fight
Holy hounds of Heaven are at our side

You want to set out for the city's turning wheel
But I want to stay up on the hill

Baby, aren't you happy
Out of all the crowds?
The tension of the people makes me drown

Lay down all your weapons
We don't have to fight
Holy hounds of Heaven are at our side

You want to set out for the city's turning wheel
But I want to stay up on the hill

You want to set out for the city's turning wheel
But I want to stay up on the hill1Embed
