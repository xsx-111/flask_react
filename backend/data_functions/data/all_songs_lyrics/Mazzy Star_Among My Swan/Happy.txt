Happy LyricsField of light
They hold me inside
Count my stars
They're all lucky in the sky
There's a time
When you go off the light
And all my things look like someone else's memories
Cold outside
Burns a great big hole in my heart
I just wait till you're happy
And your smile makes it bright
It makes it bright
Sleep inside
Ocean has miles
It shimmers and it glows
For some people
I know it shines
I know it shines
Stay inside
Don't the colors make you blind
They hold me inside
Count my stars
Let them shine
I know they shineEmbed
