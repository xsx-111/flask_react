Rose Blood LyricsEveryday you can see
Changes in her hair and smile
I can wait a million days
While her smile goes away
Sometimes I feel deceived
By the slices in her hand
Secrets in her lipstick mouth
Shine me on never again
Shine me on never again
Capture a smile and then that's all
You won't know her so it's okay
Funny how things change
