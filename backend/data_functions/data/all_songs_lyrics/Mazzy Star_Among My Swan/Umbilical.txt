Umbilical LyricsShe should have seen the thing in mother's belly
Grew up alongside her sister of ethnical
She reached out for nourishment
And falls from her mother's umbilical cord
With her sister in the womb
One day she opens her mouth wide and swallows her surroundings
The red, and orange and the sounds all around her
Now she was in her corner
Now she was in her corner
Her eyes closed with some kind of complete
Happiness
Some kind of complete
Happiness
Now she can walk in the sunlight
With a quiet sense of relief inside
Now she walks in the sunlight
An extra feeling inside her soul makes her cry
In her mother's belly her mouth opens wide her sister
One day she opens her mouth wide and swallows her surroundings
The red, and orange and the sounds all around her
In the sunlight makes it go away
Now she was in her corner
In the sunlight
Now she was in her corner, she listens
Her eyes closed with some kind of complete
Happiness
Some kind of complete
Happiness
And now she walks in the sunlight
With the extra feeling inside her
Now she walks in the sunlight
With the extra feeling inside her
Inside her1Embed
