Rhymes of an Hour Lyrics
Cannot hear what you're saying
Could I tell you so
And I can't leave my troubles
And I'm going home

Lie and sleep
Under deep
You know

While the cold winter waitin'
While you stumble home
All these things we were searchin'
Now we just don't know

Lie and sleep
Under deep
I think you know

For the rhymes of an hour
Now I'm goin' home
And I can't believe I'm nothin'
'Cause I'm coming down
Lie and sleep
Under deep
Do you know2Embed
