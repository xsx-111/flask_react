Still Cold LyricsYou really had a million hearts to break
All those times I never left you in the moonlight
How come there's always someone else driving your car
Taking you different places in the sunlight
Still cold like the stars
That's just the way you are
Still cold like the stars
You used to say your heart felt like a stone
Now everything you ever wanted is your own
Still cold like the stars
That's just the way you are
Still cold like the stars1Embed
