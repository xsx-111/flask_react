Disappear Lyrics
Just because you call my name
I cannot hear, it's not the same
You close your eyes and knock me back
All the things that I had to have

And now you choose the thorny cave
I can't believe what I had to say
All the things you never see
I'll never be what you want me to be

Now I can't disappear
Now I can't

Close your eyes and look at me
I can't believe what I cannot see
Everything is like you say
Change your mind and you'll have to forgive

And I can't disappear
Now I can't
Now I can't
