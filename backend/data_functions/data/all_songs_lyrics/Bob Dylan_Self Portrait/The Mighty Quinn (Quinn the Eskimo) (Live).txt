The Mighty Quinn (Quinn the Eskimo) (Live) LyricsEverybody's building ships and boats
Some are building monuments
Others, jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair
Every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna jump for joy
Oh, come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Oh y'know, I like to do just like the rest
Y'know, I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste
Y'know, ain't my cup of meat
Everybody's out there
Feeding pigeons out on a limb
When Quinn the Eskimo gets here
The pigeons gonna run to him
Oh, come all without, come all within
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Whoah, guitar now
Cat's mew and cow's meow
Y'know, I can recite 'em all
Tell me where it hurts you, honey
I'll tell you who to call
Nobody can get any sleep
Y'know their stepping on everybody's toes
Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna wanna dose
Oh, come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Oh, come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty QuinnEmbed
