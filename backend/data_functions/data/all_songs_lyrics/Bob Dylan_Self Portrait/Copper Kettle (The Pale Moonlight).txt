Copper Kettle (The Pale Moonlight) Lyrics
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight

Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood, they'll get you by the smoke
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight

My daddy he made whiskey, my granddaddy he did too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight
In the pale moonlightEmbed
