Dolly Dagger  LyricsHere comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge
Aw, drink up, baby
Been riding broomsticks since she was fifteen
Blowin' out all the other witches on the scene
She got a bullwhip just as long as your life
Her tongue can even scratch the soul out of the devil's wife
Well, I seen her in action at the Player's Choice
Turn all the love men into doughnut boys
Hey, red hot mama, you better step aside
This chick's gonna turn you to a block of ice
Look out!
Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so strong, gonna make you stagger, baby
Dolly Dagger
She drinks her blood from a jagged edge
Uh, right on
Drink up, baby
Hey!
Yeah, look at old burnt out Superman, tryin' to shoot his dust on the sun
Captain Karma kids, they're dead on the run
Oh, words of love, do they ever touch Dolly Brown?
Better get some highway an' clear outta town
Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger
She ain't satisfied 'til she gets what she's after
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge
Better watch out, baby, here comes your master
Alright
Watch out, Devon
You give me a little bit of that heaven
Dolly, heavy mama, get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama, get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama, get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama, get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
