Look Over Yonder Lyrics
Look over yonder, here come the blues
The thirteenth of any time, powered by fools
I can see them coming
Wearing a blue armored coat
You're sitting here with your violins
Hitting wrong notes
Look over yonder, he's coming my way
When he's around, I never have a happy day
(You even bust my guitar strings)

Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonder

Well, he's talking to my baby
They found my peace pipe on her
Now they're dragging her away
Lord knows we don't need a devil like him beating us around
Well, he's knocking on my door
How my house is tumbling down
Now don't you come no closer
The path is keeping me bolder
Wait by my door, baby
Unless you want to start another war
Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonderEmbed
