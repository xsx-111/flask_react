Left Speaker Blown LyricsWe don't outgrow hard feelings
Facades of living free and unfulfilled
We're good with time, not with friends
I hope you'll never learn to play music
There are no words, other ways
I thought I ruled out once before, insane
I gave no fight, I'm not weak
I gave up captured, without force, freely

Say the word pull
Say the word nag
Say the word limb
Say the word shove
Say the word sub
Say the word vine
Say the word dive
Say the word limb2Embed
