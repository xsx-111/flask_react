Pro Anti Anti LyricsThey brood in ecstasy, a thought to wrap your head 'round
The burn that earns the gleam, red crystals shine above a yacht
They put an axe in them, those ripe with complications
Like cars into a tree, I'll die before the fire's out
A hug I give myself, good ones can make me smile
Make amends to well fed men, they fatten more than feed
Clawed upon like guilt through time, or sleep collects to sheets
I built a tower, sealed the door, slept clear my memory
Pain stress and sorrow, from the world that blurs the me from me
They built advanced machines, I'm short a foot or two from proud
The crook that turns the key, some preschool spy they blew apart
That covered half the land, with spring's first white carnations
Like cars into a tree, I'll die before the fire's out
I brood in ecstasy, a thought to wrap my head around1Embed
