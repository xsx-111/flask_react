Mess on a Mission Lyrics
Cast out culture
Compound impatience
Without rigour
Trash the book the film's half based on

I can't go long
Without assistance
I can't get far
Trash the book the film's half based on

Facts are facts and fiction's fiction

A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
(Facts are facts and fiction's fiction)
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
Black, tabby, calico
Whiteout the coats they wear
Whiteout the snow if time allows

Facts are facts and fiction's fiction

Bleach party massacre
Cleaned our intentions out
If I could only see them now

Facts are facts and fiction's fiction

A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
(Facts are facts and fiction's fiction)
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
(Facts are facts and fiction's fiction)
A mess on a mission
Facts are facts and fiction's fiction

We called you at the seance
But only doubts appeared
I fought and lost to dumb it down

Facts are facts and fiction's fiction

We call and messed it up
Clear now, accomplices
My only question is just how?

Facts are facts and fiction's fiction

A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
(Facts are facts and fiction's fiction)
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
A mess on a mission
(Facts are facts and fiction's fiction)
A mess on a mission
Facts are facts and fiction's fiction

Facts are facts and fiction's fiction
Facts are facts and fiction's fiction
Facts are facts and fiction's fiction
Facts are facts and fiction's fiction
Facts are facts and fiction's fiction
Facts are facts and fiction's fiction
Facts are facts and fiction's fiction
Facts are facts and fiction's fiction2Embed
