Vox Tuned D.E.D. LyricsI can't get better
I want the best though
If I'm running out of lifetime
You should just say so

Five hundred peaced up people
I don't care what they write
I want no courtship in their plight
They say I'm not a teacher
I know the reasons why
I can explain another time
Don't ask me why the people
Oh tell me why
Cry, count then bellow
As time fades my birthstone
Yeah I had to wait our lifetime
For you to say so

Don't you listen to your heart?
There was a summertime
There really ain't nothing now
I always wondered how
To rid myself of doubt
Haven't really been forced in awhile
Try telling my underside
I always wondered how
To rid myself of doubt1Embed
