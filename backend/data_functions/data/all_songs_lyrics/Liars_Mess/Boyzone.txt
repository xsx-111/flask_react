Boyzone Lyrics
Boyzone (4x)
We are the waning light
We crawl in capsules falling
Wake up to shakes so loud
I'm switched, no trace, just take it
Saw them on and off and on
Make up good captions for it
We sound unsafe so loud
We count to 4 then face the tide

We found a place to die
Its sound by name it calls me
Break up the shapes you like
No pause, no trace, just take it
Saw it on and off and on
Make up good captions for it
We're golden, late, so wild
Is there no better place to die?
