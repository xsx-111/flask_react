Mask Maker Lyrics
Take my pants off
Use my socks
Smell my socks
Eat my face off
Eat my face off
Take my face
Give me your face
Give me your face!
Punch my face off
I like your face
I like your face
I like your face
Punch my face off
I like your face
I like your face
I like your face
I like your neck
Eat my face off
Punch my face off
Give me your face
I like your neck
I like your neck

I'm sure you're wonderful
But you're not the kind I keep in my heart
So true it's lacking force
Who'll keep me warm the way I do now?
Really deep stuff
From the waist up

Well I thought I'd hate it but now I can't give it up
I'm long past saving, I'm swallowing degenerates whole
It took both ambition and fear to finally figure it out
Well it looks so appealing, in real life it's actually not

Yeah you don't fight fair but you're now the kind I keep in my heart
I know you'll soon stop waiting 'coz now it's me that's chasing you 'round
Yeah you don't fight fair but you're now the kind I keep in my heart
I know you'll soon stop waiting 'coz now it's me that's chasing you 'round1Embed
