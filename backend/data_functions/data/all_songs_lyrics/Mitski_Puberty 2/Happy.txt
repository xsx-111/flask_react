Happy Lyrics
Happy came to visit me, he bought cookies on the way
I poured him tea, and he told me, "It'll all be okay"
Well, I told him I'd do anything to have him stay with me
So he laid me down, and I felt Happy come inside of me
He laid me down, and I felt happy

Oh, if you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

I was in the bathroom, I didn't hear him leave
I locked the door behind him, and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well, I sighed and mumbled to myself, "Again, I have to clean"
I sighed and mumbled to myself

If you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
And if you're going, take the moon
Then, maybe I will see you; in the night, I'll see you
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you17Embed
