Crack Baby Lyrics
Down empty streets sniffing glue, me and you
Blank, open eyes watch the moonflower bloom
It's been a long, hard, twenty-year summer vacation
All these twenty years trying to fill the void

Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad

With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones

Went to your room thinking, maybe, you'll feel something
But all I saw was your burning body waiting
All these twenty years on a vacation

Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you want it
Yeah, you know that you want it
You know that you
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you need it
And you know that you need it bad
With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones19Embed
