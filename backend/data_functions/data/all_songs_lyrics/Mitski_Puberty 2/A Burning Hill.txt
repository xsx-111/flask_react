A Burning Hill Lyrics
Today, I will wear my white button-down
I'm tired of wanting more
I think I'm finally worn
For you have a way of promising things
And I've been a forest fire
I am a forest fire
And I am the fire, and I am the forest
And I am a witness watching it
I stand in a valley watching it
And you are not there at all

So today, I will wear my white button-down
I can at least be neat
Walk out and be seen as clean
And I'll go to work, and I'll go to sleep
And I'll love the littler things
I'll love some littler things22Embed
