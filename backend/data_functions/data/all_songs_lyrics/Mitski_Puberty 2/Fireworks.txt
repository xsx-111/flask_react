Fireworks Lyrics
One morning, this sadness will fossilize
And I will forget how to cry
I'll keep going to work, and you won't see a change
Save, perhaps, a slight gray in my eye

I will go jogging routinely
Calmly and rhythmically run
And when I find that a knife's sticking out of my side
I'll pull it out without questioning why

And then, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry

I will be married to silence
The gentleman won't say a word
But you know, oh, you know in the quiet he holds
Runs a river that will never find home

And then, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry
Oh, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry15Embed
