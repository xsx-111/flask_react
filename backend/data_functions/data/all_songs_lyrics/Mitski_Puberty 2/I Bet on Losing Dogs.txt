I Bet on Losing Dogs Lyrics
My baby, my baby
You're my baby, say it to me
Baby, my baby
Tell your baby that I'm your baby

I bet on losing dogs
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I'll be there on their side
I'm losing by their side


Will you let me, baby
Lose on losing dogs?
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I wanna feel it
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when I'm finally fine
How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I cum
Someone to watch me die
Someone to watch me die
I bet on losing dogs
Did you get that?43Embed
