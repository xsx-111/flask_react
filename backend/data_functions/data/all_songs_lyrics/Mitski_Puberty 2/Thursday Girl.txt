Thursday Girl Lyrics
Glory, glory, glory to the night
That shows me what I am
As I go to the party on my knees
Saying "Take it all, please..."

And tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody, please
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

Glory, glory, glory to the night
It shows me what I am (Glory)
I'm not happy or sad, just up or down
And always bad

Tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody, please
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody here
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no12Embed
