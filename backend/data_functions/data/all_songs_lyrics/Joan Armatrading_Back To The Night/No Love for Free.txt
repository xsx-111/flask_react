No Love for Free LyricsYou come to me trembling trembling
Shaking at the knees
You say you love me better than
Anyone else can
My head is spinning
I'm flattered
But I don't understand
Every passing hello
How are you
You wanna know his name
Just because I was there
When you needed a shoulder
You think I'll take your name
I love for money
I'm flattered
But I can't leave my trade
You will see me holding up
Some corner store
In my twenties print
And my thumb's turned up
Yes I'm looking for a ride
Jesus woke me up
In some stranger's bed
There are a lot like you
They want to save my soul
Let me tell you
This lady loves
And she goes where she pleases
No love for free
You come to me trembling trembling
Shaking at the knees
You say you love me better than
Anyone else can
My head is spinning
I'm flattered
But I don't understand
Every passing hello
How are you
You wanna know his name
Just because I was there
When you needed a shoulder
You think I'll take your name
I love for money
I'm flattered
But I can't leave my trade
You will see me holding up
Some corner store
In my twenties print
And my thumb's turned up
Yes I'm looking for a ride
Jesus woke me up
In some stranger's bed
There are a lot like you
They want to save my soul
Let me tell you
This lady loves
And she goes where she pleases
No love for free
Let me tell you
This lady loves
And she goes where she pleases
I'm flattered
But I don't understandEmbed
