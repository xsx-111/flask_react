So Good LyricsCuddle in the morning
Kissing late at night
That's what I wanna do
With my little baby
Alright
See me take that love
And hold it tight
See me hold on tight
Watch me hold on tight
Just as in the day time
Get my smile
Candles round the table
In the pale moonlight
Blackcurrent and jelly jars
Can't hold the sweetness
Sugar itself
So nice
Been said before
But I feel it's right
And when I'm waddling old
Still wanna be there
High and mighty, oh
Old but gold
Love is you
So good
I'm a-hopping onto a passing cloud
I'm a-sailing up to a heaven
Defines kissing you
The sun's up above
Way up
A hot burning sun
Cooking up love
Making love
Making love
Making love
Making love
So good
Cooking up love
Cooking up love
So good
Cooking up love
Cooking up love
Cooking up love
Cooking up love1Embed
