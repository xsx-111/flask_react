Cool Blue Stole My Heart LyricsI swear you were not my ambition
A cooling aid was on my mind
I walked up to the bar and I ordered
Then I took my ice outside
I sat down under the hot sun
I looked around at this new land
And then oh
Cool Blue
Long dark
You stole my heart
Stole my heart
I woke up first light next morning
And I took a tram to the Leidse Plein
I hired a bike and I drove around for hours
I was searching for those dark eyes
I made a stop at the Blue Note
I passed up a chance for some good fun
Cause of you
Cool Blue
Long dark
You stole my heart
Stole my heart
Stole my heart
Stole my heart
Stole my heart
I made a stop at the Blue Note
Passed up a chance for some good fun
Looking for you, Cool Blue
Looking for you
Long dark
Cool blue
Looking for you, Cool Blue
Looking For You, Cool Blue
You stole my heart
Stole my heart
Stole my heart
Stole my heart
Stole my heart
I'm looking for you
You stole my heart
Stole my heart
Stole my heart
Stole my heart
Stole my heart
I sat down under the hot sun
You stole my heart
I'm looking for you
Looking for you
Looking for you, Cool BlueEmbed
