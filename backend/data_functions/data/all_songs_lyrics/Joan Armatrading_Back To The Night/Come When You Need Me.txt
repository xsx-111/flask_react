Come When You Need Me LyricsSo I've been sad
So I'm confused
Like most people are at times
But I love you
And this love of mine
Will comfort you
If need be
I am your friend
At times when I'm worried
I'll shy away from you
So at times
I'm without the light I need in life
But I love you
And this love of mine
Will open many doors
To make you see me
To make you see me
See me in loves light
Come when you need me
I'm needing you
We could be the starlight in the morning dew
Even in my sorrows
I'll smile for you
Makes me free to see you happy
So I turn away at times
Turn away from right and wrong
So I freeze in the breeze
In the breeze of your song
But I love you
And this love of mine
Will see you through
Giving to us the morning dew
Come when you need me
I'm needing you
We could be the starlight in the morning dew
Even in my sorrows
I'll smile for you
Makes me free to see you happy
Come when you need me
I'm needing you
We could be the starlight in the morning dew
Come when you need me
We could be the starlight in the morning dew
Come when you need me
Oh I'm needing you
We could be the starlight in the morning dew
Come when you need me
Come when you need meEmbed
