Travel So Far LyricsTravel so far
I've got to get myself back
Move so far from you
And you so true
Well let me get myself back
Never gonna wander again
Travel so far
Well let me get myself back
Was seeing the old moon
Walking past my door
He had freedom eyes
His home was the skies
And he beckoned me to his side
He said come let's, let's go
Freedom road
Just you and me
Bring the sun
If you feel
You need some warm company
Travel so far
Well let me get myself back
Move so close to you
And you're still true
It's good to have you smile back
Get back, get back, get back
I'll let you lead the way
I'm never going to wander again
Don't say
You stopped loving me
'Cos there by your side
Should be no one but me
Don't say
You stopped loving me
'Cos there by your side
I've travelled so far to be
Get back, get back, get back
Was feeling how your body moved
Watching the leaves blow in the trees
Then I thought of your touch
And that reminds me of your kiss
And I almost drove myself insane
Don't say
You stopped loving me
Thinkin up as I go
How you're gonna
Outshine sun and moon
Don't say
You stopped loving me
'Cos there by your side
Should be no one but me
Should be no one but me
Should be no one but me
Should be no one but meEmbed
