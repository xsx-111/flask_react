Dry Land LyricsLet me sail
To the depths of your soul
Let me anchor as near as I can be
To your shore
I'm coming into dry land
Been a long time at sea
And the season of loving
Has long awaited me
Tides and waves have kept me
Kept me going
I'm longing for the calm
I'm heading for the pastures
I can see on your dry land
Let the sea that once did take me
Bring me back safe to your door
For I long to touch the dry land
Of your shore
Clear back to land I'm rowing
Clear the decks
Let me touch your soul
Maybe I'll bring you back a gift of love
I'll promise you so much more
Clear back to land I'm rowing
Clear the deck
Let me touch your soul
Maybe I'll bring you back a gift of love
And I'll promise you so much more
Let me sail
To the depths of your soul
Let me anchor as near as I can be
To your shore
I'm coming into dry land
I've been a long time at sea
And the season of loving
Has long awaited me
Tides and waves have kept me
Kept me going
I'm longing for the calm
I'm heading for the pastures
I can see on your dry land
Let the sea that once did take me
Bring me back safe to your door
For I long to touch the dry land
Of your shore
Clear back to land I'm rowing
Clear the deck
Let me touch your soul
I'll bring you back a gift of love
And I'll promise you so much more
Clear back to land I'm rowing
Clear the deck
Let me touch your soul
Maybe I'll bring you back a gift
And I'll promise you so much more
Clear back to land I'm rowing
Clear the deck
Let me touch your soul
Maybe I'll bring you back a gift
And I'll promise you so much moreEmbed
