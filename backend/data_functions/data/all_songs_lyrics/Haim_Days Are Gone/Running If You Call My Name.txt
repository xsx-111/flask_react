Running If You Call My Name Lyrics
I went back to our room
And every memory came rushing back too soon
As I packed my bags, and I lied down
I felt the bed sink in and the covers surround, I let go
'Cause with my eyes closed, I see the door open wide
And with my eyes closed, I'm leaving it all behind

I, I'll run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
And I, oh, I'll run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
When you come my way
I'll keep running if you come my way

I jumped back in a daze
I saw the face of someone slowly slip away
And he had your eyes, it's too bright
And now I'm slipping through the white
Bringing me into cold dark night now
And with my eyes closed, I see the door open wide

I'll run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
And I, oh, I'll run away if you call my name
Oh, and I, I'll keep running if you come my way
When you come my way
I'll keep running if you come my way
And with my eyes closed, I see the door open wide
(I'll keep running if you come my way)
And with my eyes closed, I see the door open wide
(I'll keep running if you come my way)
And with my eyes closed, I'm leaving it all behind

I, I'll run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
And I, no, oh, I'll run away if you call my name
Oh, and I, I'll keep running if you come my way
When you come my way

Keep, keep running if you call my name
I'll keep running if call my name
I'll keep running if you call my name
Call my name, when you call my name
I'll keep running if you call my name
I'll keep running if you call my name
I'll keep running if you call my name
I'll keep running if you call my name
Keep, when you come my way now
When you call my name now
When you call my name now
Run, run, run, run if you call my name
I'll keep running, running if you call my name
I'll keep running, running when you come my way
When you come my way3Embed
