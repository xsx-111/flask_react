Go Slow Lyrics
Go slow
So that I can hear everything you're saying
Now, I know you're going
You just threw this away
You know I ain't gonna take it (go slow)
But we ain't gonna make it (I know)
I can't make you stay but

I'll be hurting from the heat
Heat heat heat heat heat heat heat
Heat heat heat heat heat
Hurting from the heat
Heat heat heat heat heat heat heat
Heat heat heat heat heat

Well, well was it something that I said?
(I know that it was something I said)
From your heat now
Going crazy trying hard to forget
(You know I'm trying hard to forget)
From your heat now
Oh, I just wanna go back, hold on, to the way that I was
Cause you took away all my young life
And I hate who I've become, from your heat now
From the heat, it's coming, coming

I know
I'm giving in and believing every lie
For now the moon is night
I turn off the light
And you shook up the foundation (go slow now)
With your intimidation (I know)
Oh, when you turn away now

I'll be hurting from the heat
Heat heat heat heat heat heat heat
Heat heat heat heat heat
Hurting from the heat
Heat heat heat heat heat heat heat
Heat heat heat heat heat

Well, well was it something that I said?
(I know that it was something I said)
From your heat now
Going crazy trying hard to forget
(You know I'm trying hard to forget)
From your heat now
Oh, I just wanna go back, hold on, to the way that I was
Cause you took away all my young life
And I hate who I've become, from your heat now
No, from your heat now
No, from your heat now
Now, from your heat now, from your heat now
From your heat now, from your heat now now baby
Now, from your heat now, from your heat now
From your heat now now now now now

Well, well was it something that I said?
(I know that it was something I said)
From your heat now
Going crazy trying hard to forget
(You know I'm trying hard to forget)
From your heat now
Oh, I just wanna go back, hold on, to the way that I was
Cause you took away all my young life
And I hate who I've become, from your heat now

(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
From your heat now
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
Oh, I just wanna go back, go back
Go back, go back
Go back, go back
Go back
I just wanna go back, go back
Go back, go back
