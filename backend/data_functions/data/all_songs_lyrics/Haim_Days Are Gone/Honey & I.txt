Honey & I Lyrics
Goodnight
I know there's nothing good in goodbye
But you lead me to no other line
No other line
Eyes wild
When you walked through the door
You made your way across the floor
And all the little girls had to try their turns
Try their turns

No, no, no, no
See, I'm not afraid no more
(I'm not afraid no more)
To turn you away no more
(Turn you away no more)
To turn you away, to turn you away

'Cause my honey and I, yeah, yeah
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now
Honey and I (Honey and I)
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
No, no
I don't love you just because
Love wasn't what I thought it once was
But I thought it once was
Telling each other everything
Picking out your wedding rings
No, now I know and now I see
I'm not afraid no more
No, no, no, no, no, no

So why are you always trying to stay at home?
(Why are you staying there?)
This song can't be played alone
(This song can't be played alone)
It was made to be played with my

Honey and I, yeah, yeah
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now
Honey and I (Honey and I)
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Ha, ha, ha, yeah
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Ah, ha, ha, yeah

My, my, my honey and I
My, my, my honey and I
My, my, my honey and I
My, my, my honey and I
My, my, my honey and I (oh)
My, my, my honey and I (oh)
My, my, my honey and I (oh)
My, my, my honey and I

Oh, no, no, no
See, I'm not afraid no more
No more, to turn you away
To turn you away
'Cause my...
No, no, no, no, no, no
D-doing just-a fine now
Honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now
D-doing just-a fine now
D-d-doing just-a fine now
D-doing just-a fine now
D-doing just-a fine now1Embed
