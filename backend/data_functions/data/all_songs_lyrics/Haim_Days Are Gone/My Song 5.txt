My Song 5 Lyrics
I found it hard, tried to reserve
I’ll get it right
When I am hurt (Hot for me)
The man's his own (Hot for me)
To her he’ll go (Hot for me)
But I’ll be fine (Hot for me)
‘Cause I know

He’s in her heart, on the floor
Thinkin' that I’ll never know
I’ll be up going through crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head
Seein' all the words I’ve said
Honey, honey, I am never coming home again

I’ve been lied to
So what’s the truth?
Now, I'm not gonna hide it all
Keep it in, all from you
I’ve been dying to know what you've tried
You’ve been lying, so
Honey, I’m not your honey pie
(No)

He’s in her heart, on the floor
Thinkin' that I’ll never know
I’ll be up going through crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head
Seein' all the words I’ve said
Honey, honey, I am never coming home again

If you want to see me, baby please
Been holding on for eternity
Say you only want me
Missing you never led to much of anything
If you wanna know, if you wanna show me
Everything's what it seemed, seemed to be
Held by a thread, tried to forget
I-I’ll never let it go
Honey, I’m not your honey pie

Tried to lie, dyin'
Hear all lies, tryin'
Tried to lie, dyin'
Hear all lies, tryin'
He’s in her heart, on the floor
Thinkin' that I’ll never know
I’ll be up going through crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head
Seein' all the words I’ve said
Honey, honey, I am never coming home again

I’ve been lied to
So what’s the truth?
Now, I'm not gonna hide it all
Keep it in, all from you
I’ve been dying to know what you've tried
You’ve been lying, so
Honey, I’m not your honey pie17Embed
