Let Me Go Lyrics
Get me out, give me in
I gave you everything I could give
You tried to take, you tried to make it
But take all everything you can't break
If you go so easily
Go on, get out, when you leave
I will wait, I will want
Wait till the day you're back again
Let me out, let me in
I've given up, not given in
'Cause together we are not one, we are nothing
We're holding on and on
Together now, forever then
Go ahead, don't you let me in
But I will wait, I will want
Wait till the day you're back again

Let me go
You know I'm not the one for leaving
Let me go
You know I'm nothing without your love, no
I know I'm nothing without your love
So let me go (Let me go)
You know I'm not the one for leaving
Let me go
You know I'm nothing without your love, no
I know I'm nothing without your love
So please, God, let me go
Let me out, let me in
I gave you everything I could give
You tried to take, you tried to make it
You take all everything you can't make
If you go so easily
Go on, get out, when you leave
I will wait, I will want
Wait till the day you're back again
Let it out, let it in
I'm giving up, not giving in
'Cause together we are not one, we are nothing
Holding on and on
Together now, forever then
Go ahead, don't you let me in
I will wait, I will want
Wait till the day you're back again

Let me go
You know I'm not one for leaving
Let me go
You know I'm nothing without your love, no
You know I'm nothing without your love, no
'Cause you know that I'm not one for leaving (Not one for leaving)
I'm not one for leaving (I'm not one for leaving)
But I'll go on believing (I'll go on believing)
Hey, I'll go on believing (I'll go on believing)
That I'm not one for leaving (I'm not one for leaving)
No, I'm not one for leaving (I'm not one for leaving)
No, I'm not one for leaving (I'm not one for leaving)
No, I'm not one for leaving (I'm not one for leaving)
So let me go (Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving
Let me go (Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving
Let me go (Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving
Let me go (Let me go)
Let me go (Let me go)
Let me go
(Not... one for leaving...)

You know I'm not one for leaving
Let me go (Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving
Let me go (Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving
Let me go (Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving (Let me go)
