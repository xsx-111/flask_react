Ellen LyricsBeneath the shade
I will wait
For Ellen
Though I have gone before
I will wait
For Ellen
I'll pass the time
With our memories
For Ellen
I took them on ahead
I kept them safe
For Ellen
Beyond the river
I will wait
For Ellen
I will wait
I will wait
Below there, below there
Below there, below there
Scar in the sky
Floating down/by
Sun's burning up
Such a shame
A figure of a comet in the sky
I'll tear it down, tear it down
For you, babe2Embed
