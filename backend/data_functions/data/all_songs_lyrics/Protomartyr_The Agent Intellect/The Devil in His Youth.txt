The Devil in His Youth LyricsBefore recorded time
In some suburban room, see
The devil in his youth
He grew up pale and healthy
With the blessings of his father
The devil in his youth
His privilege came before him
The promise of adoring
The devil in his youth
But it all changed when he came of age
It was nothing like the simulated game
The women didn't love him
The races all ignored him
His proclamations failed
So he screamed
"Now you bend!"
The devil in his youth
I will make them feel the way I do
I'll corrupt them till they think the way I do
The devil in his youth
You will feel the way I do
You'll hurt the way I do
He was easily abused
The devil in his youth3Embed
