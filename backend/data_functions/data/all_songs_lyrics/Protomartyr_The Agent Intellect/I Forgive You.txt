I Forgive You LyricsAhhhh you
Heretics, cheats
Fifty misses deep, common thief
DUI-OWIs
Exit MacGuffin’s, exit!
You’re not a regular here
I forgive you though
Saw you wobble at JAMS last week
The judge’s racket is big business you know?
Chemist priest
Proves they don’t all look like Matt Z
Caught him in the locker room
Running tapes - taking notes
On where the boys fall on the spectrum
Scientific method
Artisanal handouts
Thanks a lot! I’d rather outcrop with palm flashes
Bosley crawlers
The eyes of Kayrouz are upon you
What’s the matter with you?
Why you keep on making that mistake?
I forgive you
But I feel it’ll happen all again
Recurring
Like a turn on Outer Drive and 6
Crawl through life
Who stole this car and why are we in it and where do we go again?
Fail at life
And you’re pulling up and pulling up and pulling up again
You fail at life
Pulling up and pulling up and pulling up
Feel alive, feel alive
And you’re pulling up and pulling up and pulling up againEmbed
