Why Does It Shake? LyricsFalse happiness is on the rise
See the victims piled high
In a room, without a roof
Sharp mind, eternal youth
I'll be the first to never die
Nice thought, and I'm never gonna lose it
The city grows within my head
Street plans follow electric grids
Brick and steel house everything
I am the founder of myself
And I'm never gonna lose it
Never gonna lose it
Never gonna lose it
Never gonna lose it
Never gonna lose it
On my eyes
Lithe in thought and pumping blood
Muscle, bone and ligament twined
Answer only to that point of light
Love its shine
And I'm never gonna lose it
From this throne see the curve of the earth
Turn around see it curve right back
History's my backyard, eternity's my reward
I have it all and all is mine
And I'm never gonna lose it
Never gonna lose it
Never gonna lose it
Never gonna lose it
Never gonna lose it
Why does it shake?
The body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body
Why does it move?
The fear, the fear, the fear, the fear, the fear, the fear
Why does it shake?
The body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body
Why does it move?
The fear, the fear, the fear, the fear, the fear, the fear
Why does it shake?
The body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body
Why does it move?
The fear, the fear, the fear, the fear, the fear, the fear
Welcome the stranger
The stranger always wins
He enters the temple
It falls
It falls, it always falls
Why does it shake?
The body, the body, the body, the body, the body
Why does it shake?
The body, the body, the body, the body, the body
Why does it shake?
The body, the body, the body, the body, the body1Embed
