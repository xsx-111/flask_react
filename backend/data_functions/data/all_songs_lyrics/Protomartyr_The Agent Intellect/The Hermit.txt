The Hermit LyricsSound the alarm
Sky's a swarm
Not in my house
Stabled up
Leave with my books
Do I escape?
Maybe I leave?
Ride out?
I don't think so
Milky eyes upstairs
Should I tell them to bug?
Plan an escape
See where they go?
Follow them down
To where they can see
Ride out?
I don't think so
They lie, they lie, they lie, they lie
They lie, they lie, they lie, they lie
In the same year the King of France
Made peace with Swiss
A monster was born in Germany
With a head in the middle of its stomach
That took food just like the other
They lie, they lie, they lie, they lie
They lie, they lie, they lie, they lie
Everyone's with cupidity here
Engendered to the sea
With an eye in the middle of the forehead
Liver upside down
And I?
Ride out?
I don't think so
They lie, they lie, they lie, they lie
They lie, they lie, they lie, they lie
Ride out
I summon the cull
And it's coming around
There's a knot in the sky
And it's going down
And I don't wanna leave
Think I'll stay
Ride out?
I don't think soEmbed
