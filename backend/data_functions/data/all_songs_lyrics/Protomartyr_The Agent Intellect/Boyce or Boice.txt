Boyce or Boice LyricsWhat have they wrought
From screen to self?
Electronic malfunction
The strange opinions
From foreign lands
The tumbling waves of complaint
From lonesome men

You let them into our home
You let them into our home
You let them into our home
Boyce or Boice or
Old laptop ink cartridge
That dial-up smut
Your secret lovers
Exist as numbers

You let them into our home
You let them into our home
You let them into our home
Boyce or Boice or
They know our movements
They own our failures
Your brain in pocket
Eats it up
Destroy the gateway
Bind them up
Break the circuit
Cast them out
Bind them up

Remove the fire from thine eyes
