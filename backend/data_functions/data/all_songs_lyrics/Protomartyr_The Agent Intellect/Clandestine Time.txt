Clandestine Time LyricsClandestine time
The small, unseen things
That do the job
While the minutes tick by idly
Abridged from life
Folded into abstraction
And on the clock

The proof we are here
Is the dust that they're breathing
The proof we're apart
Is the fact they're still living
They don't see usEmbed
