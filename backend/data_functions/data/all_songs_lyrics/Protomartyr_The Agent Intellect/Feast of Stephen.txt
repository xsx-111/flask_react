Feast of Stephen LyricsWaking up on another day
Last night's mistake
Sleeping in the hay
The sun cracks open
Like a running egg
They found my body in your head
They found my body after a thousand years
How many babies born this year?
And can we all send them right back?
Fight them off and plan an attack?
Stumbling and I fall asleep
They can't stone me 'til
I fall asleep
The Feast of Stephen
Yeah!Embed
