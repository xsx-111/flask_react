Stab My Back Lyrics
Now we're broken on the floor
She just wants me to share her
It hasn't been this way before
She just wants me to dare her

The phone rings and she screams
"Stab my back, it's better
When I bleed for you
Walk on me, it never was enough to do"
I can't get past her
Falling faster
It's true
It hasn't done a lot for you

And every time he held you close
Yeah, were you thinking of me?
When I needed you the most
Well, I hope that you're happy

The phone rings and she screams
"Stab my back, it's better
When I bleed for you
Walk on me, it never was enough to do"
I can't get past her
Falling faster
It's true
It's better when I bleed for you
I hope that love he gave you
Was just enough to save you
You nearly broke my heart
Just look at what you're tearing apart

Stab my back
"It's better when I bleed for you
Walk on me
It never was enough to do"
I can't get past her
Falling faster
It's true
It hasn't done a lot for you

It's better when I bleed for you
It never was enough to do
It hasn't done a lot for youEmbed
