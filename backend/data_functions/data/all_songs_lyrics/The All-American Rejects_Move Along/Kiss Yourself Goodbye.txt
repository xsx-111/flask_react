Kiss Yourself Goodbye Lyrics
Blank face little girl
Your colors running down
It’s the one you love
Cry out my world, this copulated kiss
It’s the last that you deserve

I’ve done wrong
I’ve been gone
It’s the one you love
Drink down and your candles burn
Away, away

Dreaming you, is so easy, yeah
If it was up to me, then you would cry tonight
If it was up to you

Take you, take me away
I can’t go with you now
Don’t you wish I’d try
Left just a trace, it's growing colder still
So kiss yourself goodbye
I’ve done wrong
I’ve been gone
It’s the one you love
Drink down and your candles burn
Away, away

Dreaming you, is so easy, yeah
If it was up to me, then you would cry tonight
When it's up to you, you kiss yourself goodbye

Let go, push your daisies
A thousand maybes, a thousand left I'm done
A white glow, just for tasting
A life for wasting (it’s the one you love)
And I look into your eyes, it's the one you love

Last one then I fill you up today, today
How can you sleep
When dreaming you, is so easy, yeah
If it was up to me, then you would cry tonight
When its up to you, you kiss yourself goodbye
You would cry tonight (Yeah)
So kiss yourself goodbye (Yeah)
You would cry tonight (Yeah)
So kiss yourself goodbyeEmbed
