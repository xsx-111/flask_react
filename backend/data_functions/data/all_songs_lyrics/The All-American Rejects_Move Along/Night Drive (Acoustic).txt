Night Drive (Acoustic) LyricsI know you
So better than the city in the rear view
I drive to
Eliminate the ball that I'm chained to
Take, me, break, me
Every mile further, there's a part of me that slips away
One, day, you'll, see
Even if you got down on your knees
You couldn't make me stay
Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
You, fight, fight, fight
All you wanna do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
I'll stay strong
I'm pushing on the pedal 'til I break dawn
So I'm gone
Go find another shoulder you can cry on
Take, me, break, me
Every mile further, there's a part of me that slips away
One, day, you'll, see
Even if you got down on your knees you couldn't make me stay
We could drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
You fight, fight, fight
All you wanna do is hurt me
You wrecked m' life
I'm gonna have to drive all night (woo...)
You wrecked m' life
Now I'm gonna have to drive all night (woo...)
You wrecked m' life
Now I'm gonna have to drive all night
All of the things that you knew that I'd try (knew that I'd try)
All of the things that I held inside
All I gotta do is drive
We could Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
Get away from it all
You fight, fight, fight
All you wanna do is hurt me
You wrecked m' life
So I've gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked m' life
Now I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked m' life
So I'm gonna have to drive all nightEmbed
