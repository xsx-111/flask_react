Change Your Mind Lyrics
Don't solve the problem
When danger is better
Far away you stock them
In cages and tether

And all the bridges you've burned
Leave you trapped off at all sides
Now the tables do turn
And it's all gone, what's left for you

And when the sky is falling
Don't look outside the window
Step back and hear I'm calling
Give up, don't take the fast road
It's just your doubt that binds you
Just drop those thoughts behind you, now
Change your mind, let go too soon

Sit down, you're sinking
There's no one to watch you
Skip town, you're thinking
There's no one to stop you
And all the bridges you've burned
Leave you trapped off at all sides
Now the tables do turn
And it's all gone, what's left for you

And when the sky is falling
Don't look outside the window
Step back and hear I'm calling
Give up, don't take the fast road
It's just your doubt that binds you
Just drop those thoughts behind you, now
Change your mind, let go too soon

Don't run away, start feeling fine
It's better than your worst, worst day
No words to say, I'll give you mine
And pocket all the hurt
Just stay, don't run away
It's better than your worst, worst day

And when the sky is falling
Don't look outside the window
Step back and hear I'm calling
Give up, don't take the fast road
And when the sky is falling
Don't look outside the window
Step back and hear I'm calling
Give up, don't take the fast road
It's just your doubt that binds you
Just drop those thoughts behind you, now
Change your mind, let go too soon
Don't run away
Change your mind
Let go too soon
Don't run away
Change your mind
Let go too soon
Don't run away
I'll change your mind
Let go too soon
Don't run away
Change your mind1Embed
