Eyelash Wishes Lyrics
Spin round, tell me what to say
Break down, no other way
What is it? Is this it?
This is it

Back to, I never knew your name
Stick through, sun after the rain
And she shines, how she shines
This is it

And shadows blend one last time (Save those kisses)
And your picture speaks on this time (Eyelash wishes)
Because, I've been up three days, awake, awake
Two more weeks and I'm threatening to fade
The world still turns, what makes sense?
Stretch this song to a fever cadence
Up three days, awake, awake
Two more weeks and I'm threatening to fade
And all things close, all I wish
Never change these distances

Green eyes, everything I see
Green skies, if left up to me
And I know that she knows
This is it
And shadows blend one last time (Save those kisses)
And your picture speaks on this time (Eyelash wishes)
Because, I've been up three days, awake, awake
Two more weeks and I'm threatening to fade
The world still turns, what makes sense?
Stretch this song to a fever, cadence
Up three days awake, awake
Two more weeks and I'm threatening to fade
And all things close, all I wish
Never change these distances

Just be brave, just listen to me
Your heart gives mine reason to beat now

Because, I've been up three days, awake, awake
Two more weeks and I'm threatening to fade
The world still turns, what makes sense?
Stretch this song to a fever cadence
Up three days, awake, awake
Two more weeks and I'm threatening to fade
And all things close, all I wish
Never change these distances
And shadows blend one last time (Save those kisses)
And your picture speaks on this time (Eyelash wishes)Embed
