11:11 pm Lyrics
All the windows swear to miss you
And the doors are cell block tight
Sweet sedation, sweep the issues
And the clock's about to strike
Did it call you down? Are you back just yet?
Waiting now, please come, set me free
And the only sound is a minute left

This could be, this could be the last time

It's a chance to fix mistakes
One more for the last time
Does it blow our dreams away?
Don't waste this chance with your smile
Ten seconds left on this dial
This could be the last time

Along the staircase, I dream to hear you
In a whisper-quiet room
Space for thinking, space to scream to
But the echoes sound like you
Not the stars at night, in a pitch-black sky
I don't know, just want to see you
But the time is right and it only flies
This could be, this could be the last time

It's a chance to fix mistakes
One more for the last time
Does it throw our dreams away?
Don't waste this chance with your smile
Ten seconds left on this dial
This could be the last time

It's only us, it's only now
A simple wish, it's only tonight
This could be the last time
Now I've made our last mistake

One more for the last time
(This could be, this could be)
Does it blow our dreams away
(This could be, this could be)

Don't waste this chance with your smile
(This could be, this could be)
Ten seconds left on this dial
(This could be, this could be)
This could be the last time
It's only us, it's only now
It's only tonightEmbed
