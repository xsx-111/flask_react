Top of the World Lyrics
Is there anybody out there?
That wakes up with a bitter taste?
It's a king that we put up there
And he's a short way to fall from grace
It's slowly filling upward
You can stand but you have no ground
I hear it from the lost words
They say it's time that you lost your crown

Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts are beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away, I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finding a day, don't wanna be you
When the top of the world falls on you

Is there anybody out there?
That can see what a man can change?
It's better that you don't care
Because he knows that he's in his stage
I feel the paranoia
When there's a time, put you in your place
In the eyes of those who watch ya
Well they can wait 'til you hit your face
Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts are beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away, I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finally a day, don't wanna be you
When the top of the world falls on you

Paint yourself a picture
When you waste another picture
And you win, and you win, and you win
Paint yourself a picture
And then you break another picture
And you win, and you win, and you win
And you win, yeah you win, and you win

Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts stop beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away, I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finding a day, don't wanna be you
When the top of the world falls on you
Wasting away, I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finding a day, don't wanna be you
When the top of the world falls on youEmbed
