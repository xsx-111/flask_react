Seven Days Too Long LyricsThe first time I called you, Girl, they said you wasn't home
And the second time I telephoned, ah, they all told me to leave you alone
We had a lovers' quarrel, yes we did, like all lovers do
I wanted to make-up, it's only left to you now
Cos seven days is too long without you, Baby
Come on back to me
Seven days is too long without you, Baby
Come on back to me
I refuse to break-up, ah, but I'm too weak to fight
And our love is too strong, yes it is, to go on and let it die
Let's sort out these problems, cos, ah, I can see the danger signs
And it's written on your face, just as it worries my face
Cos seven days is too long without you, Baby
Come on back to me
Seven days is too long without you, Baby
Come on back to me
You've got me so wired up, ah, I can't even concentrate
I say good things will come, I say good things will come to those who wait (wait)
I'm not gonna wait around forever, listen to me, listen:
Seven days is too long without you, Baby
Come on back to me
Seven days is too long without you, Baby
Come on back to me
Seven days is far too long
It's much too, much too, much too long
Seven days without youEmbed
