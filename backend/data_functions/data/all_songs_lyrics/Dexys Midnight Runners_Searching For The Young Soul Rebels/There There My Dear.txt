There There My Dear LyricsDear Robin
Hope you don't mind me writing
It's just there's more than one thing I need to ask you
Yes, yes, yes, yes
You're so anti-fashion, so wear flares
Instead of dressing down all the same
It's just that looking like that I can express my dissat
Robin let me explain
Though you'd never see in a million years
Keep quoting Cabaret, Berlin, Burroughs, J.G. Ballard, Duchamp, Beauvoir
Kerouac, Kierkegaard, Michael Rennie
And I don't believe you really like Frank Sinatra
Dear Robin
You're always so happy, how the hell?
You're like a dumb dumb patriot
Yes, yes, yes, yes
You're supposed to be so angry, why not fight?
Let me benefit from your right
Don't you know the only way to change things is to shoot men who arrange things?
Dear Robin I'd try and explain
But you'd never see in a million years
Well, you've made your rules, but we don't know that game
Robin, I'd listen to your records but your logic's far too lame
And I'd only waste three valuable minutes of my life with your insincerity
You see Robin
I've been searching for the young soul rebels
I've been searching everywhere
And I can't find them anywhere
Where have you hidden them?
Maybe
Maybe you should
Maybe you should welcome the new soul vision
Welcome the new soul vision
Welcome the new soul vision
Welcome the new soul vision
Don't you know the only way to change things is to shoot men who arrange things?
Dear Robin I'd try and explain
But you'd never see in a million yearsEmbed
