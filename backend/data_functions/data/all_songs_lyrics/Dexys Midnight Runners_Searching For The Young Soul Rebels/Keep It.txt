Keep It LyricsThe world lives in your front room
You're sitting happy in gloom
Fate worries you, you will not give her room
You give credit for might, inspiration and sight
But you miss the point
You won't join the fight
You think to use is to lose so your clinging, pulling pleading
Try and keep it safe
Keep it cozy but it feels so out of place
You're feeling a loss but youre not fit to make it
You offered so much but youre frightened to take it
It never was really proved, never was understood
But there really is no virtue in the good
The shoutings so loud that they'd do better to mime
You're deafened and you cannot hear the rhyme
But secrets in whispers pull you, try to tempt you
Try and keep it safe
Keep it cozy but it feels so out of place
You're feeling a loss but youre not fit to make it
You offered so much but youre frightened to take it
You beg for help and advice, how to handle your life
But you dare not move, you cannot pay the price
Chances slip, you just chatter, flatter, to forget what matters
Spout your lines, read all your books
You hear the sounds, miss all the hooks
Your best is what you least understand
You hate the graft, won't join the race
You're scared to scar your pretty face
Safe now cause your head is in the sand
Keep itEmbed
