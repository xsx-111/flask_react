Tell Me When My Light Turns Green LyricsSeen quite a bit in my twenty-three years
I've been manic depressive and I've spat a few tears
Spat on and shat on
(Tell me when my light's on)
Would you please tell me when my light turns green?
Spat on and shat on
(Tell me when my light's on)
Would you please tell me when my light turns green?
Rambling and gambling
Just hoping for more
I've been losing and boozing
But I don't know what for
Will anybody help?
(Tell me when my light's on)
Would you please tell me when my light turns green?
It's not that I don't believe in you
Oh, your work's all around for me to see
Won't you please help?
(Tell me when my light's on)
Would you please tell me when my light turns green?
Would you please tell me when my light turns green?
Would you please tell me when my light turns green?Embed
