Burn It Down LyricsFor God's sake, burn it down
I'll only ask you once more
You only want to believe
This man is looking for someone to hold him down
He doesn't quite ever understand the meaning
I never heard about Oscar Wilde
I don't talk about Brendan Behan
I don't think about Sean O'Casey
I don't care about George Bernard Shaw
He doesn't care about Samuel Beckett
He won't talk about Eugene O'Neill
Edna O'Brien and Lawrence Stern
Shut it! You don't understand it
Shut it! That's not the way I planned it
Shut it! Shut your mouth 'til you know the truth
I'll only ask you once more
It must be so hard to see
This man is waiting for someone to hold him down
He doesn't quite fully understand the meaning
Shut it You don't understand it
Shut it That's not the way I planned it
Shut your fucking mouth 'til you know the truth
Oscar Wilde and Brendan Behan
Sean O'Casey, George Bernard Shaw
Samuel Beckett, Eugene O'Neill
Edna O'Brien and Lawrence Stern
Sean Kavanaugh and Sean McCann
Benedict Keilly, Jimmy Hiney
Frank O'Connor and Catherine RhineEmbed
