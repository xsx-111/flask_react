Wheels Lyrics
She was a danger
Ain't no stranger
You got me rock n rollin'
Around the town
Just fooling around
She going to break you
Wanna make you
Going to make it

Want to take it down
She gonna ride you, wanna slide you down

Wheels
Spinning 'round my brain
Driving you insane
Wheels
Rolling 'round my head
Going through the red

She wanna shake you
No way to save you
She got me shot, I'm falling
I'm blowing it out
Know what I am talking about?
She gonna ride you
Want to slide you
Ain't no faking
She want to take you out
You bet you're right
She gonna spin you around

Wheels
Spinning 'round my brain
Driving you insane
Wheels
Rolling 'round my head
Going through the red
Wheels
Flying down the road
Ready to explode
Wheels
Burning up the road
Hitting overload



Wheels
Ready to explode2Embed
