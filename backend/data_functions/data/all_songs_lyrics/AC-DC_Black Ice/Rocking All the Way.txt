Rocking All the Way Lyrics
Well, one mad shuffle
He says two women is trouble
Sweat out a duel
I am humming right at you

I said
You did an evil raid
Coming on at night
You know to come along with you
You got to run away and hide
Two by two
Well, I said I am coming right at you

She's rocking all the way
She's coming out my way
She going all the way
She coming out to play

She's sexy in her boots, yeah
She tear up all the news
Shoot you in the back
Driving you mad
Come on, hear me out
And take my advice
She won't stop until you're in her sights
 

One mad shuffle
Two women trouble
Going to kick you right off the track
You got to push it, hug it
Trust her of it
She's going to make you pay, all the way
She's coming out my way
She's rocking all the wayEmbed
