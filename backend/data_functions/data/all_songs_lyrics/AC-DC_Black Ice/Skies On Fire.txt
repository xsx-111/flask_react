Skies On Fire Lyrics
Why don't you hang up
Won't you back up
Pack up and head for higher ground
I know you
And you know me
Tell me what is you wanted to be
What you wanna be
What you need in me
Hey, Hey, Hey

Skies on Fire
Flames burn higher
Skies on Fire
Flames get higher

I know you
Now you know me
Tell me what it is you wanted to be
In the rain
In the streets
You're amazed by all the things that you see
Tell me what I see
How it's got to be
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah


Hey, Hey, Hey
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

When you look in the sky
(Skies on fire)
Look in the sky
(Flames burn higher)

Skies on fire
Flames burn higher
Skies on fire
I know you, now you know me
Tell me what it is you wanted to be
Hey, Hey, Hey
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Skies on fireEmbed
