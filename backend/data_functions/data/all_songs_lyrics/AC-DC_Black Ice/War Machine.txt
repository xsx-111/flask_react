War Machine Lyrics
Push your foot to the floor
Don't need no more
You been kickin' around
While you're messin' about

Better catch her name
Come on in
Give me that thing
That thing gone wild

War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)

Make a stand, show your hand
Call in a high command
Don't think, just obey
I'm like a bird of prey

Better catch her name
Come on in
Give me that thing
That thing gone wild
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)

Better watch your back
And cover your tracks
Kick your foot through the door
Hit the deck, know the score
They're taken by surprise
And here's mud in your eye

Misery's the name if you shoot 'em for gain
Call of the wild
Hurry for naught
That thing gone wild

War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
Let's go

That thing gone wild
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)1Embed
