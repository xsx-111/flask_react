Decibel Lyrics
Take up all your time
Kick up your heels, looking fine
And you come riding blind
You come rolling back a while

Wind a-blowing on, yeah
We're gonna move on and on
Sweating heat soak you all
Beat it out, I'll make you crawl all night

Decibel

Has you from deep inside
You were waving then you smiled

Debonair rock and roll
Very loud
Louder than rain
Cool, in there rocking, standing proud

Decibel
That's the history of rock n roll
Decibel
When I've called on
We're going to ride along
A hundred miles, in all
Betting in night 'til dawn
Spread the joy coming on
Yeah, hard and long
Slide right down
With a shock, hit the ground

Decibel
You come rolling back a while
