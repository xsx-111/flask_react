Money Made Lyrics
Work work money made
Work work money made
Work work money made
Work work money made

Went right down to LA
They roped her in
She couldn't get away
Spreadin' cash all about, yeah
The die was cast
There's no getting out a matter money made

Work, work, money made
Champagne life, high on display
Work, work, money made
Work, work, money made
Keep it up, you get it made
Work, work, money made

Campaign in to Hollywood
She's living it up
It feels mighty good
Recommendations all around
Come taste the sweet life
That's what it's all about
That money made
Work, work, money made
Champagne life, high on display
Work, work, money made
Work, work, money made
Keep it up, you make the grade
Work, work, money made

Ooh, that money made
Ooh, that money made
Hit the gas

The party life is good for her
Getting outta bed nearly half past four
Her swimming pool is the biggest about
So don't you call, 'cause she ain't around
That money made

Ooh, money made
Ooh, that money made

Work, work, money made
That money made
Work, work, money made
Strings of pearls, all kinds of chains
Shake it, baby, shake
Said shake, baby, shake
Shake, baby, shake
I said shake, baby, shake
Ooh, just shakeEmbed
