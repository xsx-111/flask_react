Thoughts For Naught Lyrics
If you want to fly
If you want to become a star
A superhero

You could try the ascension
Of the great pyramid of life
Counting again and again from one to nine
Approaching and pushing away infinity
Oh sweet absurdity!

But if you prefer that old silly number zero
You'll become a master of doing nothing being
NothingEmbed
