Master Builder Lyrics
Iao za-i za-o
Ma-i ma-o
Ta-i ta-o now


Maybe you don't know
Maybe you know
Maybe you know you know
Maybe you don't know what you know you know you know

Maybe you don't know what you know you know za-i za-o
Ma-i ma-o
Ta-i ta-o now
Maybe you don't know what you know you know za-i za-o
Ma-i ma-o

Master Builder
Tell me how you make a temple
Tools and moon stones
You don't really need them, you know
Master Builder
Tell me what the temple's made of
Deep inside you
You can build an invisible temple in your
Own imagination if you will3Embed
