You Never Blow Yr Trip Forever Lyrics
Have a cuppa tea
Cuppa hubba dubba
Didn't you forget something
Another one
Roll another brother
Maybe you forgot someone
A bit a'cake
Yum yum
Haven't you forgotten
Have another drink
Have a lager!
Wot did we forget let's see...
Sink another one
Yea yea!
Wot's the scene today?
You know the Octave Doc...
When's he commin momma?
Tell me what's the time?
Don't know
We better ask
Have another lager!
Where has everybody
Gong! I hear the Gong!
Wait a minute man
Hey! We missed the Buzz...
Oh No!
Zero...
Where are you?
Don't ya remember why you came to Everywhere?
The piece of mind that
You came to find has disappeared
For all that you could take
Was piece of cake and wine
And now you'll have to wait another time


Maybe you're here for the giggle
Maybe you're into the puzzle
Maybe you're blowing the bubble
Maybe you're all in a muddle

The more you know
The more you know you
Don't know what you know
Stone's throw left to go
Bad weather hell for leather
Now and zen you goof again
You never blow your trip forever
Earth mother
Soul brother
Be high here now
Third eye open soon
Meanwhile new world group soul
Lost and found underground
Next time round
A real weird number
Is Zero the man
Because he keeps a turnin on
Round and round again
They say he'll never make it
But I think he can

There's a hole in the morning
It's the hole that he was born in
Now the old man's yawnin'

It's the world of illusions
And Zero the Hero
Is up to his ears
In the mysteries
No solution to speak of
Around and round and round
Round and round
That's Zero going round again
And maybe you come
And maybe you're gone
And maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're a one
And maybe you two
And maybe you're free
And dunno what for
Just as long as you're alive
It's all the same
It's all in the name
It's all in the sky and
It doesn't really matter
If you make it
So long as you try
So it's back on the path
Beside the road to everywhere
Gonna jump my horses
Over the weeks to everywhere
And with you we will share
Your sack of cares
And if things don't change for
Better or worse
Well man you must be dead
But ya don't have to give up hope
And ya don't have to give up dope
And ya don't have to change your ways
You just have to
Be what you are my friends today
That's what the Octave Doctor says


So there goes Zero the Hero
Turning on around the wheel of births and deaths
And meanwhile the Octave Doctors
And the Pot Head Pixies and
All the other characters of Planet Gong
Have to leave you now
With this last a-little song

Why don't you?
Why don't you?
Why don't you try?
Try
Why don't you try, ta-ta-try?
Try
Oh why don't you try?
Oh why don't you try-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-aye?
Ta-try
Yay yay
Why don't you, why don't you try?
Ta-try, ta-ta-try
Why don't you try?
Why why don't you try?
Ta-try, ta-ta-try
Oh why don't you try?
Oh why don't you try?
Why? Ta-try
Oh why don't you?
Why don't you?
Don't you try
Why don't you?
Why don't you try?
Why don't you try?
Why don't you?
Don't you try
Why don't you?
Don't you try
Why don't you?
Don't you try
Why don't you try?
Don't you try
Why don't you try?
You try
Why don't you try?
Why don't you try?
Go on, have a bash
Go on
Go on, try
Go on, go on I try
You gotta try
You try
Bye bye!
Bye bye!
Try!
Bye bye!
Bye bye!
Bye bye!

You are I or I am you
You I am or I am you
You am I or am I you
You are Maya Ram are you

You am I or I am you

You am I as I are you
You are Maya's eye are you
You are I or I am youEmbed
