Perfect Mystery Lyrics
It's a perfect mystery
How becomes a tree a tree
But there's something telling me
That nothing is for
Nothing is for
Nothing is for
Only one lifetime
Learning to be

Cops at the door
No cops at the door
Cops at the door
No cops at the door

What a surprise!
She looked in the cupboard
And found the eyes
In the suitcase

On the Isle of Everywhere
It becomes a man to share
All and everything he cares for
Everyone is
Everybody
Else is lowly
Melting themselves
Together again
Look up in the air
The Octave Doctor's there
And when he strokes his gong
Your middle eye comes on

What a surprise!
She looked around for Zero
But he'd lost his eyes
In a fruitcakeEmbed
