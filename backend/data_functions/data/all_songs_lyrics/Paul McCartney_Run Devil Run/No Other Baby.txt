No Other Baby Lyrics
But I don't want no other baby, but you
I don't want no other baby, but you
'Cause no other baby can thrill me like you do

Got a little woman lives across the hall
I got a little woman, she lives across the hall
And most every evening, she's asking me to call

But I don't want no other baby, but you
I don't want no other baby, but you
'Cause no other baby can thrill me like you do

Well lots of other women say "Be my daddy do"
Yeah, lots of other women say "Be my daddy do"
But I tell them I don't want no other baby but you

I say I don't want no other baby but you
No, I don't want no other baby but you
'Cause no other baby can thrill me like you do, ooh ooh1Embed
