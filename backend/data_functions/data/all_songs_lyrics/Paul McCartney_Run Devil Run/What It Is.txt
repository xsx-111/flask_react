What It Is Lyrics
You are what it is
That makes the world go around for me
You are what I need
You make me feel good about myself

You see, I love you so much
I can never do without your touch
I'm like a busy honeybee
I'm always hungry for it
How could anyone ignore it?
Surely everybody will agree

That you are what it is
That makes the cloud roll around the sky
Oh yeah, you got what it takes
You make me proud to be who I am

You see, I love you so much
I can never be without your touch
I'm like a busy honeybee
I'm always hungry for it
How could anyone ignore it?
Surely everybody must agree
That you are what it is
That makes the world go around for me
Yeah you are what I need
You make me feel good about myself


Well you are what it is
That makes the world go around for me
Yeah you got what I need
You make me feel good to be myself

You know, I love you so much
I can never do without your touch
I'm like a busy honeybee
I'm always hungry for it
How could anyone ignore it
Surely everybody must agree

That you are what it is
That makes the world go around for me
You make the world go around for me
Yeah, you make the world go around, world go around
World go around for me
You're what it isEmbed
