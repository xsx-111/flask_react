Party Lyrics
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But moving and a grooving going to satisfy my soul

Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight

I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room

And let's party
Let's have a party
Send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight

Now, honky-tonky Joe
Is knocking at the door
Bring him in and fill him up and set him on the floor
And have a party
Yeah let's have a party
Send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight


Well, I feel it in my leg
Feel it in my shoe
Tell me, pretty baby if you think you feel it too

Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Oh, I'm going to send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight

Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But moving and a grooving going to satisfy my soul

Let's have a party
Yeah let's have a party
Oh, I'm going to send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight
We're going to send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight
Oh yeah
We're going to have ourselves a little party tonight
I'm not giving up yet
I'm going to have a party, yeah
Party hearty
Yeah I'm not going home yet
Send it to the store and buy some more
Come on and have a party tonight
Some people like to rock
People like to roll
Moving' and groovin' to satisfy my soul
Let's have a partyEmbed
