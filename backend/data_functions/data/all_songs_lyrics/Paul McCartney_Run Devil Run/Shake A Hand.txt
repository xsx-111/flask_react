Shake A Hand Lyrics
Just leave it to me
Now don't you ever be ashamed
Just give me a chance
And I'll take care of everything
Your troubles I share
I'll let you know when I'll be there
I'll take care, take care of you
Any place and everywhere

Shake a hand, shake a hand
A-shake a hand if you can
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you can


Be truthful to me and I'll be truthful to you
But I'm in love, I'm in love with your soul
And I don't now just what to do
So let's call it a day
I've said all I've got to say
Except, oh yeah, baby, you got to learn how to pray
And shake a hand every day

Be truthful to me and I'll be truthful to you
But I'm in love, I'm in love with your soul
And I don't now just what to do

So shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you can
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you canEmbed
