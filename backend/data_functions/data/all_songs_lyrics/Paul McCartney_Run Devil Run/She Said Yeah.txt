She Said Yeah Lyrics
Dum deedle dee dum dum
Little girl, where did you come from?
You fine little thing, you make my heart sing
Come on baby, let me buy the wedding ring

Baby you drive me crazy
Drive my poor heart hazy
You got my senses reelin', oh baby, what a feelin'
Come on, baby, let me make love to you

She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, baby, I wanna make love to you too"

You know I got the feelin'
In my soul
I know I love ya, no one above ya
Come on, baby, just let me love you

"Yeah"
She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, baby, I wanna make love to you too"

Well you got me crazy
My love you've been saving
You see my miss, I wanna kiss
Come on, baby, don't treat me like this

She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, baby, I wanna make love to you too"
"Yeah"
She said, "Yeah"
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, baby, I wanna make love to you too
Yeah yeah
Come on, baby, I wanna make love to you too"Embed
