Brown Eyed Handsome Man Lyrics
Well, flying across the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She'd be walking thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history three thousand years, in fact
Ever since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shedding tears
Over a brown eyed handsome man
A lot of trouble was a brown eyed handsome man

Well, the Milo de Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To win a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Well, a beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter
Go out and find yourself a brown eyed handsome man
Just like your daddy was a brown eyed handsome man
Yeah

Well, a two-three the count with nobody on
He hit a high flyer into the stand
A-rounded third, he was a-heading for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man that won the game
It was a brown eyed handsome man
It was a brown eyed handsome manEmbed
