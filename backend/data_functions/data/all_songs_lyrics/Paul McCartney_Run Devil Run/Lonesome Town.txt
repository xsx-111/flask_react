Lonesome Town Lyrics
There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And we call it Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay

Where you can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is heart full of tears

Going down to Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay
I'm going down to Lonesome Town
To cry my troubles away

Well now, in the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget

Going down to Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay
Yeah I'm going down to Lonesome Town
To cry my troubles, cry my troubles away

In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget

Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forgetEmbed
