All Shook Up Lyrics
Well bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm acting wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mm, yeah, yeah, yeah

My hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmm, yeah, yeah!

Please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feeling fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Well now please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feeling fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death

When she touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm mm, mmm, yeah, yeah
Mm mm, mmm, baby now I'm all shook upEmbed
