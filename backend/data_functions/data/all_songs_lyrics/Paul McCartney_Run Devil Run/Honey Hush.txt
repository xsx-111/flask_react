Honey Hush Lyrics
Well, come on in this house, stop all that yakety-yak
I said, come on in this house, stop all that yakety-yak
'Cause your sugar daddy don't want no talking back

Well, you keep on talking, talking 'bout this and that
Yeah, you keep on talking, talking 'bout this and that
I got news for you, baby, you're nothing but an alley cat

Well, it's a hi ho, hi oh Silver, hi oh, hi oh Silver, hi oh, hi oh Silver
Hi oh, hi oh Silver, hi oh, hi ho Silver away-hey


Turn off the waterworks, baby, they don't move me no more
Turn off the waterworks, baby, they don't move me no more
Well, you believe me, baby, I ain't coming back no more


I said, come into this house, stop all that yakety-yak
Yeah, come into this house, woman, stop all that yakety-yak
Oh, don't make me nervous, I'm holding a baseball bat
Well, it's a hi yo, hi ho Silver, hi oh, hi oh Silver, hi oh, hi oh Silver
Hi oh, hi ho Silver, hi oh, hi oh Silver away-heyEmbed
