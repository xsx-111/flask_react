Bluejean Bop Lyrics
Bluejean baby, with your big blue eyes
Don`t want you looking at other guys
Got to make you give me, one more chance
I can`t keep still, so baby let`s dance

Well the bluejean bop is the bop for me
It`s the bop that`s done in a dungaree
You dip your hip, you free your knee
Wiggle on you baby, one two three

Well bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, the bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won`t you bop with me


Well bluejean baby when I bop with you
Well my heart starts hopping like a kangaroo
My feet do things they never done before
Well bluejean baby, give me more more more

Bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, the bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won`t you bop with me
Yeah rock today

Oh bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, the bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won`t you bop with me
Yeah bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, the bluejean bop
Baby, bluejean bop, baby won`t you bop with GeneEmbed
