Try Not To Cry Lyrics
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong
How can I help it but I don't know this song
All day I try to be a man
Help me to do it, show me the plan

Try, try, try
I try not to cry, cry cry
Cry over you-oo-oo
Over you
Yes I try, try, try
I try not to cry, cry, cry
Cry over you-oo-oo
Over you

I want to enjoy being alive
Don't want to leave before I arrive
I like to sing, I'll sing along
How can I do it, when I don't know the song

Try, try, try
I try not to cry, cry cry
I cry over you-oo-oo
Over you
Yes I try, try, try
I try not to cry, cry, cry
Cry over you-oo-oo
Over you

Baby I try, try, try
I try not to cry, cry cry
Cry over you-oo-oo
Over you
Yes I try, try, try
I try not to cry, cry, cry
Cry over you-oo-oo
Over you

(Yes I try)
(Yes I try)
Whoa I try, I try
(Yes I try)
(Yes I try)Embed
