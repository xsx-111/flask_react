I Got Stung Lyrics
Holy smokes! Land sakes alive
I never thought this would happen to me

Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah
I got stung by a sweet honey bee
What a feeling came over me
Well it started in my eyes, crept up to my head
Flew into my arms, till I was stung dead
I'm done, uh-huh, I got stung
Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah

She had all that I wanted and more
I've never seen honey bees before
Well she started through my ears, buzzing in my brain
Got stung all over but I feel no pain
I'm done, uh-huh, I got stung

Well don't think I'm complaining
Because I'm might pleased we met
Because you give me just one little peck
On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat
If I live to be a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzing around your hive
Every day at five
I'm never going to leave once I arrive
I'm done, uh-huh, I got stung
I got stung yeah, I got stung yeah

Well don't think I'm complaining
Because I'm mighty pleased we met
Because you give me one little peck
On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat

If I live to be a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzing around your hive
Every day at five
I'm never going to leave once I arrive
I'm done, uh-huh, I got stung, yeah
I'm done, uh-huh, I got stung, yeah
Because I'm done, uh-huh, I got stung
Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
I got stung, yeah
I got stung, yeah
I got stung, yeah
I got stung, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got stung, yeah
I got stung, stung, stung, yeah yeah, yeah
I got stung, stung, stung, yeah yeah
I got yeah yeah yeah yeahEmbed
