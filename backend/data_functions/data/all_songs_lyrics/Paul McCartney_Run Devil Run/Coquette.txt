Coquette Lyrics
Hear me, why you keep fooling, little coquette?
Making fun of the one who loves you?
Breaking hearts you are ruling, little coquette
True hearts tenderly dreaming of you

Someday you'll fall in love, as I fell in love with you
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too
And when you are alone with all your regrets
You know, my little coquette, I love you


Someday you'll fall in love, as I fell in love with you
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too
And when you are alone with all your regrets
You know, my little coquette, I love youEmbed
