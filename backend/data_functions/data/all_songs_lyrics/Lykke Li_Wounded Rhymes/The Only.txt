The Only Lyrics
Don’t stand by my window
Don’t knock on my door
Don’t ever enter my chamber
Don’t you bother coming by anymore
Leave me alone with my fever
Leave me alone with my plea
Leave me alone where you left me
Leave me alone with my wound

They won’t let me go, no
They can’t let me, I know
They won’t let me walk, no
And I’m not the only
They can’t let us go, no
They won’t let me, I know

And don’t chase a life that is leaving
Don’t chase a life that is lost
Stay on your side I got reason
To be alone with my wound

It won’t let me go, no
They can’t let me, I know
They won’t let me walk, no
And I’m not the only
They can’t let us go, no
They won’t let me, I know
They won’t let me go, no
They can’t let me, I know
They won’t let me walk, no
And I’m not the only
They can’t let us go, no
They won’t let me, I know

I’m staying seventeen
For all I'll ever be
From all I ever known
Forever seventeen
My heart is on my sleeve
All I’ve ever known
It won’t let me go, no
It can’t let me, I know
It won’t let me, I know

It won’t let me go, no
It can’t let me, I know
It won’t let me walk, no
And I’m not the only
They can’t let us go, no
They won’t let me, I know
It won’t let me go, no
It can’t let me, I know
They won’t let me walk, no
And I’m not the only
It can’t let us go, no
They won’t let me, I knowEmbed
