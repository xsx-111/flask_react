Made You Move Lyrics
I made you move, I made you move
From the man you are
You made me move, you made me move
Run just to fall

From mighty woman, I'm not a woman
I'm just a ray of light
Fall fast, so steep low
You made me move

I made you mine, I made you mine
Inside myself you're mine
You made me change from the weak
Made me lose my chain

No longer woman, I'm not a woman
I'm just a ray of light
Fall fast, so steep low
You made me move

You made me move
You made me move
You made me move
You made me moveEmbed
