Get Some Lyrics
Don't pull your pants
Before I go down
Don't turn away
This is my time
Don't make demands
I don't take none
Just say a prayer then its gon' get done

Don't pull your pants
Before I go down
Don't turn away
This is my time
Like a shotgun
Needs an outcome
I'm your prostitute
You gon' get some
Like a shotgun needs an outcome
I'm your prostitute
You gon' get some

Go ahead, go way low
Where I can do no harm
Go ahead, go way low in my honey lovin' arms
Go ahead, go way low
Where I can do no wrong
Got you 'round my finger like a lonely lover's charm
Like a lonely lover's charm
And cause I can
I'm gon' go west
Just like a man
I'm the fortress
Like a shotgun
I can't be outdone
I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some
Like a shotgun needs an outcome
I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some

Go ahead, go way low
Where I can do no harm
Go ahead, go way low in my honey lovin' arms
Go ahead, go way low
Where I can do no wrong
Got you 'round my finger like a lonely lover's charm
Like a lonely lover's charm

Go ahead, go
Go ahead, go
Go ahead, go
Go ahead, go
Go ahead, go
Go ahead, go
Go ahead
Go ahead, go way low
Where I can do no harm
Go ahead, go way low in my honey lovin' arms
Go ahead, go way low
Where I can do no wrong
Got you 'round my finger like a lonely lover's charm
Like a lonely lover's charm3Embed
