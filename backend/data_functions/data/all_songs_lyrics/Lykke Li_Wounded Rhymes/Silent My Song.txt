Silent My Song Lyrics
Eyes wide shut and I still feel the needle in my back
Cutting through my veins and spirit, making me relapse
I can't tell if I am living or just holding on
'Cause wicked games seeks wicked winners, kick me till I drop

You silent my song
No fist is needed when you pull

And you see pain like it is pleasure
Like a work of art
Where I'm your painting, I'm your treasure
Purest of them all
And call it love or call it murder
Kill me quietly
Close the door then take it further
Where no man has been

You silent my song
No fist is needed when you pull
You silent my song
No fist is needed when you pull
Silent, oh, silent
Silent my song
Silent, oh, silent
Silent my song
Silent, oh, silent
Silent my song
Silent, oh, silent
Silent my song

You silent my song
No fist is needed when you pull
You silent my song
No fist is needed when you pull

You silent my song
No fist is needed when you pull4Embed
