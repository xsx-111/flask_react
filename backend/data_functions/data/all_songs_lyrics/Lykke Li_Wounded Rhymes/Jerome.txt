Jerome Lyrics
Front and back, you're on my mind
Your name is on my ceiling
And how I know, I know you're mine
And for you are not leaving
I hear your shouting, I feel your pounding
Now you're mine, you're mine again
Swear you'll never leave me

In my mind I hear your song
It's playing while I'm dreaming
Didn't mean to make it real
But couldn't stop my feeling
I hear your crying, I feel you winding
Now you're mine, you're mine again
Swear you'd never leave me

Oh, oh, Jerome
Oh, oh, Jerome
I'm screaming at nothing, Jerome
You got me for nothing, Jerome

Front and back, you're on my mind
Your name is in my ceiling
And how I know, I know you're mine
And for you are not leaving
I hear your shouting, I feel your pounding
Now you're mine, you're mine again
Swear you'll never leave me
Oh, oh, Jerome
Oh, oh, Jerome
I'm screaming at nothing, Jerome
You got me for nothing, Jerome

Oh, oh, Jerome
Oh, oh, Jerome
I'm screaming at nothing, Jerome
You got me for nothing, Jerome2Embed
