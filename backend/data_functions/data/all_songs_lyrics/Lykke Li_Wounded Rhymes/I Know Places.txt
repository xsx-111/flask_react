I Know Places Lyrics
I know places we can go babe
I know places we can go babe
The high won't fade here babe
No, the high won't hurt here babe

I know places we can go babe
I know places we can go babe
Where the highs won't bring you down babe
No, the highs won't hurt you there babe

Don't ask me when but ask me why
Don't ask me how but ask me where
There is a road, there is a way
There is a place, there is a place

I know places we can go babe
Coming home, come unfold babe
And the high won’t fade here babe
No, the high won’t hurt here babe

So come lay and wait
Now won't you lay and wait, wait on me
I know places we can go babe
Coming home, come unfold babe
I know places we can go babe
Coming home, come unfold babe2Embed
