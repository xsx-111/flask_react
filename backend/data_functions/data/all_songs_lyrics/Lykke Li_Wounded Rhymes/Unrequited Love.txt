Unrequited Love LyricsOnce again it's happening
Oh this love is unrequited
Twice the pain, the suffering
Oh my love is unrequited
Oh my love is unrequited
That must mean I'll live again
And get back what I gave my men
Get back what I lost to them
Oh the shame, this crying game
Oh my love, I've been denied it
Oh my love is unrequited
And I know it so well
I could play it by ear
Looking back at myself
While the violin plays
And blue is my tune
Another stitch to my wound
Another inch in this dwell
I know it all too well
When once again it's happening
Oh our love has gone divided
Oh my love is unrequited
Oh my love is unrequited
Oh my love is unrequited
Oh my love is unrequited4Embed
