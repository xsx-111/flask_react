Love out of Lust Lyrics
Rather die in your arms than die lonesome
Rather die high than die hollow
The higher that I climb
The deeper I fall down
I'm running out of time
So let's dance while we're waiting

We will live longer than I will
We will be better than I was
We can cross rivers with our will
We can do better than I can
So dance while you can
Dance 'cause you must
Love out of lust
Dance while you can

Rather live out of line than live wondering
How the fire feels while burning
For life is like a flame
And the ash is for wasting
So honey, don't be afraid
To dance while we're waiting
We will live longer than I will
We will be better than I was
We can cross rivers with our will
We can do better than I can
So dance while you can
Dance 'cause you must
Love out of lust
Dance while you can

So tired of waiting
Come, baby
So tired of waiting
Come, baby

We will live longer than I will
We will be better than I was
We can cross rivers with our will
We can do better than I can

We will live longer than I will
We will be better than I was
We can cross rivers with our will
We can do better than I can
So dance while you can
Dance 'cause you must
Love out of lust
Dance while you can
Love out of lust
Love out of lust
Love out of lust
Love out of lust
Love out of lust
Love out of lust
Love out of lust
Love out of lust
