Happiness Lyrics
Join our group and you will find
Harmony and peace of mind
Make it better
We're here to welcome you
We're all on a journey to
Finding the real inner you
Make it better (make it better)
We're here to welcome you

Time stops still when
You've lost love, ah-ah

Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love

Floating in the magic world
Donate all your money, we'll
Make it better (make it better)
We're here to welcome you
We can see your troubled soul
Give us all your money, we'll
Make it better (make it better)
We're here to welcome you
Time stops still when
You've lost love, ah-ah

Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love

We'll be swimming in the sea
Of wisdom and serenity
Make it better

Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love
Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love
Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love
Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love1Embed
