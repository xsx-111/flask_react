Road to Somewhere Lyrics
Walking down the Mercer Street, been a long hot summer
Rain like daggers coming down on me
Get a feeling it's too late, but alone, together
Could be we might start it up all over again

Dream, dream, you're not too late
Sweet road to somewhere else
Live under the radio
Are you calling

Three o'clock I'm on my way on the road to somewhere
Little clouds like wounds that blow away
Listening to the radio like a friend that guides me
Playing out every song we used to know

Dream, dream, you're not too late
Sweet road to somewhere else
Live under the radio
Are you calling

Bring it on
Come along
On the road to somewhere
Take our time
See the signs
On the road to somewhere
(Listen to the radio)
(Are you calling)
Bring it on
Come along
On the road to somewhere
(Listen to the radio)
(Are you calling)
Take our time
See the signs
On the road to somewhereEmbed
