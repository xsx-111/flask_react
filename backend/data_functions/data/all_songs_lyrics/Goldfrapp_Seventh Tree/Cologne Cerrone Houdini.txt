Cologne Cerrone Houdini Lyrics
Moments of perfection
Idle in the sunshine
Over there in yonder
In another world

I'm not your kind, I'm not your girl
Dreams we had seemed bright and passed the time

Cologne Cerrone, Cerrone Houdini, Cerrone Houdini
Cologne Cerrone, Cerrone Houdini, Cerrone Houdini

Sunlight in your eyes

Driving over stateside
Left the smoke behind us
Could we be together
In another world?

I'm not your kind, I'm not your girl
See I'm in your car, but not your life
Cologne Cerrone, Cerrone Houdini, Cerrone Houdini
Cologne Cerrone, Cerrone Houdini, Cerrone Houdini

Sunlight in your eyes
Sunlight in our eyes
Like diamonds in your hair1Embed
