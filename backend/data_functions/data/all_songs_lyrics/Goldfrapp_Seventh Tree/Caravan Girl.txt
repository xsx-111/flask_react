Caravan Girl Lyrics
What is her name?
That caravan girl
What is her name?

You were like the sun
A hazy day
What is her name?

We're just talking
Like there's something
Like you know
Domino, Domino

Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Yeah, get away and bring it all back
Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Yeah, get away and bring it all back

Barefoot and game
That stranger on the hill
What is her name?
You were like the sun
A lazy day
Have you no name?

Don't stop talkin'
There's just something
Like you know
I'd like to know
Should I stay or should I go
It's a long, wrong way to go
And I won't deny
Yeah, I won't be shy

Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Yeah, get away and bring it all back
Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Yeah, get away and bring it all back

Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
And bring it all back
(La la la la la)
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
And bring it all back
(La la la la la)
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
And bring it all back1Embed
