A&E Lyrics
It's a blue, bright blue Saturday, hey hey
And the pain has started to slip away, hey hey
I'm in a backless dress on a pastel ward that's shining
Think I want you still, but it may be pills at work

Do you really wanna know how I was dancing on the floor?
I was trying to phone you when I'm crawling out the door
I'm amazed at you, the things you say that you don't do
Why don't you ring?

I was feeling lonely, feeling blue
Feeling like I needed you
And I've woken up surrounded by me
A&E

It's a blue, bright blue Saturday, hey hey
And the pain has started to slip away, hey hey
I'm in a backless dress on a pastel ward that's shining
Think I want you still, but it may be pills at work

How did I get to accident and emergency?
All I wanted was you to take me out
I was feeling lonely, feeling blue
Feeling like I needed you
And I hoped you'd call, hoped you'd see me
