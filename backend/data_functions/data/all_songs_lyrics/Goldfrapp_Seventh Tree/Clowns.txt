Clowns Lyrics
Only clowns would play with those balloons
What'd you wanna look like Barbie for?
Dear O Lord, it's easy
Roasting, roasting, roast indeed
Mahogany
Titties that live on and on and on and on
Only clowns would play with those balloons
What'd you wanna look like Barbie for?
Dear O Lord, it's easy


Only clowns would play with those balloons
Passive when I'm in record
Day and night I'm watching you
Roasting, roasting, roast indeed
Mahogany
Titties that live on and on and on and on
Only clowns would play with those balloons
What'd you wanna look like Barbie for?
Dear O Lord, it's easy
