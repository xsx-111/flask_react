Monster Love Lyrics
I never thought I would return
To be consumed by you again
Think you're cured
You'd see it come

The folly of
A monster love
Like you

Grey is good
The light is good
We went down to Hollywood
You only get one chance in Tinsel Town

I save the part
The sweetest part
Shook for you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is where we start
And where we end
I never thought I would return
To be consumed by you again
But I know a paper moon

The folly of
A monster love
Like you

The pavement smell
Just after rain
The sun leaps out, it's clear again
I told you how I felt the earth could move

The folly of
A monster love
Like you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is where we start
And where we end
Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is where we start
And where we end

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is where we start
And where we end

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is where we start
And where we end
Everything comes around...Embed
