Eat Yourself Lyrics
If you don't eat yourself, no doubt the pain will instead
You could loan the light, say it all messed up

You went south on the train, she wore plastic boots for rain
And you crawl along exhausted
No sense, no reason

Who will I be when I'm with you again
Silver jet in the sky
You are the pain, got a song, got to sing
For life

If you don't eat yourself, no doubt the pain will instead
If you don't eat yourself, you will explode instead

So how can I love you so
When I know you don't love me
 say it all, get wicked 

Who will I be when I'm with you again
Silver jet in the sky
You are the pain, got a song, got to sing
For life
