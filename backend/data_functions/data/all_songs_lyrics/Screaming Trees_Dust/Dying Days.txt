Dying Days LyricsAll these dying days
I walked the ghost town
Used to be my city
I seen a holy man
Seen him crying with the mother Mary
All these dying days
Yes, it's too late
This life isn't mine
Lord, hear me pray
Can you ease my mind?
Now that they're gone forever
Jesus, I done gone over
Sleeping alone
You stay on your side
If I could lie
Like all of a thousand other times
I wouldn't be on this highway
Taken on down this highway
All these dying days
I walk the ghost town
Used to be my city
I seen a holy man
Seen him crying with the mother Mary
All these dying days, ah yeah
All these dying days
I walk the ghost town
Used to be my city
I seen a holy man
Seen him crying with the Mother Mary
All these dying days, ah yeah
Yes, it's too late
This life isn't mine
Lord, don't you hear me pray
Can you ease my mind?
Waiting for the sunshine
Waiting for the sunshine
All these dying days
I walked the ghost town
Used to be my city
I seen a holy man
Seen him crying with the mother Mary
All these dying days, ah yeah
Dying, woah dying, oh dying, daysEmbed
