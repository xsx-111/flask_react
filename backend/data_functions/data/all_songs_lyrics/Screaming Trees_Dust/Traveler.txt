Traveler LyricsIt's a broken morning outside
Go easy on my mind
Because you're this dream I'm hanging on
And I'm trying to make the dawn
And the longest way I travelled
From the darkness to the light
Lord it's been a million miles
And these prisons, I can't abide
I'm halfway here, I'm halfway there
I'm halfway here, I'm halfway there
I'm halfway here, I'm halfway there
And all along I've been a traveller, yeah
Forever out of time
Forever just unwinds
I see the green beyond the blue
And I'm trying to make it through
And the longest way I travelled
From the darkness to the light
Lord it seems a million miles
All my brothers, I can't abide
I'm halfway here, I'm halfway there
I'm halfway here, I'm halfway there
I'm halfway here, I'm halfway there
All along I've been a traveller, yeah
This twilight world is cold
Go easy on my soul
Because you're this dream I'm hanging on
And I'm trying to meet the dawn
And the longest way I travelled
From the darkness to the light
Lord it seems a million miles
And these persons, I can't abide
I'm halfway here, I'm halfway there (x5)
All along I've been a traveller
