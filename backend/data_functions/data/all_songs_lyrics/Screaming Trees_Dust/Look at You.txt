Look at You LyricsHer ghost hides in my mind in the night
In a way she's haunting me
I'm wanting her still
Through rose coloured skies
Or blue, blue moonlight, and miracles
I'm high as she's walking by
And when I look at you I got a second chance
Really need to have you now
One by one they fall
It always breaks me down
The quiet cuts me through
The candle burns, the knife is turned
The pain will arrive, I know, deep inside
When I look at you I've got a second chance
Really need to take it now
One by one they fall, it always breaks me down
One by one they fall, it always breaks me down
One by one it always breaks me down
Her ghost hides in my eyes, in the night
In a way she's haunting me, I'm wanting her still
Through rose coloured skies
Or blue, blue moonlight and miracles
I'm high as she's walking by
And when I look at you I've got a second chance
Really need to have you now
One by one they fall, it always breaks me downEmbed
