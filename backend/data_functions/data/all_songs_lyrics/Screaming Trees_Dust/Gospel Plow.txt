Gospel Plow LyricsIf you want to get to Heaven let me tell you how
Keep your hand on the Gospel plow
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Mary had a golden chain
Every link spelt Jesus' name
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Mary had a golden chain, hold on
If you want to get to Heaven let me tell you how
Keep your hand on the Gospel plow
Waking up without you now I'm on my own
Coming down the sky burns into my soul
And I want to know that you're mine
I've got to know you're mine
Coming back tomorrow said you'd be alright
I never find a way now to kill the time
And I want to know what's in your mind
I got to know your mind
And I fell alone, and my dreams are told
You're not at all, not at all
Not at all who you say you are
I'm glad I know, glad I know
Glad I know where you're going
Waking up without you girl I'm on my own
Coming down the sky burns into my soul
And I want to know that you're mine
I've got to know you're mind
And I fell alone, and my dreams are told
You're not at all, not at all
Not at all who you say you are
I'm glad I know, glad I know, glad I know
Where you're goingEmbed
