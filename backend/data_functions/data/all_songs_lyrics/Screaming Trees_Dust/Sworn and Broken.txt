Sworn and Broken LyricsWinter's setting in again
And it feels like the end is near
Sense a sense I ain't had in long
Watching the seconds passing by
Come January, I swear this world
Won't be the one that we once lived on
Took an oath for a promise sworn and broken
All that's gone away
On Monday morning you can't wake up
Still dreaming of what could have been
Something good has gone and left you
It's another tear, one more denial
Come January, I swear this world
Won't be the one that we once lived on
Took an oath, another a promise sworn and broken
All that's gone, all that's gone before you've changed
When Monday morning you don't wake up
Still dreaming of what could have been
Something good has gone and left you
It's another tear, one more denial
Come January, I swear this world
Won't be the one that we once lived on
Took an oath, another promise sworn and broken
All that's gone, all that's gone before
All that's gone before
All that's gone before, It's changed1Embed
