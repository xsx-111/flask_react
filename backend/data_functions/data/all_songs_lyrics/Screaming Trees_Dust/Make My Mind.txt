Make My Mind LyricsTake a minute just to breathe
Take a minute till I'm wide awake
I am searching once again
And the sun has left the sky
And you're on my mind, you're on my mind
Take a second to believe
Just a second, you won't have to wait
Don't you turn your back on me
I couldn't look into your eyes
And I don't know why, and I don't know why
But I'll try again on another day
You make my mind
Just want to leave this world behind
You make my mind, you make my mind
Let the silence creep in
In the silence I'm awake all night
Just searching once again
But could I reach you in the morning light
If I close my eyes, if I close my eyes
Well, you're here right away
You make my mind
Just want to leave this world behind
You make my mind, you make my mind
You're on my mind, I'll try again on another day
And I don't know why, and I don't know why
If I close my eyes, If I close my eyes
You're here right away
You make my mind, just want to leave this world behind
You make my mind, just want to leave this world behind
You make my mind, you make my mind, you, you
You make my mind, make my mindEmbed
