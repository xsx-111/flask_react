Halo of Ashes LyricsShe wears a halo of ashes
Spectre of the wind
Waits on me so patiently
I no longer can pretend
Sky lies a thousand miles below
Stars shine and the moon is clear
Nothing and for no one
Won't see me if you're here
I've been a long, long time away
Got one foot in the grave
Glorified in the dying of the sun
My angel pulls me closer
As my poison she crawls through
Walks with me so silently
I no longer can refuse
Tomorrow I'm a thousand miles behind
Stars shine and the moon below
Wake me where you find me
Pretend you don't know
I've been a long, long time away
With one foot in the grave
Glorified in the dying of the sun
She wears a halo of ashes
Spectre of the wind
Waits on me so patiently
I no longer can pretend
Tomorrow I'm a thousand miles behind
Face painted in the moon below
Wake me where you find me
Pretend you don't know
I've been a long, long time away
With one foot in the grave
Glorified in the dying of the sun
I've been a long, long time away
With one foot in the grave
Glorified in the dying of the sunEmbed
