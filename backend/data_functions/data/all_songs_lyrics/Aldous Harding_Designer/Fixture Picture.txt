Fixture Picture Lyrics
Honey, your face is folding up
As the memory kisses you goodbye
It's better to live with melody and have an honest time
Isn't that right?

There's a definite vibe
You can't be pure and in love
In the corner in blue
Is my name (In the corner)

Fixture picture
I've got it, I'm on it
You're in it, I'm honored
Fixture picture
I've got it, I'm on it
You're in it, I'm honored

I'm on, I've never burned brighter
How's the wine where you live?
Bet it's expensive
One day we'll share a glass together and ride the dunes
I'm writing too
There's a definite vibe
You can't be pure and in love
In the corner in blue
Is my name (In the corner)

Fixture picture
I've got it, I'm on it
You're in it, I'm honored
Fixture picture
I've got it, I'm on it
You're in it, and I'm honored


Fixture picture
I've got it, I'm on it
You're in it, I'm honored
Fixture picture
I've got it, I'm on it
You're in it, I'm honored
Fixture picture
I've got it, I'm on it
You're in it, and I'm honored2Embed
