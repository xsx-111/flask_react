Treasure Lyrics
I made it again to the Amazon
I've got to erase, the same as the others
And I see it far cleaner than that

Expecting two but ready for three
I just stood up and I mean it
I have better than that

A rock in my hand
A living mirror
The braided cover of love
I've got my eye on you now
Treasure

What will you do if the game keeps changing?
Will you die on the vine, choosing it over?
And when you bleed out, you'll know better than that
And that you couldn't take it

A rock in my hand
A living mirror
The braided cover of love
I've got my eye on you now
Treasure
A hand in time, that's no miracle
The arrival of none, fan in the gallows
Now that is something
And when we need it, we'll know better than that
And that we couldn't beat itEmbed
