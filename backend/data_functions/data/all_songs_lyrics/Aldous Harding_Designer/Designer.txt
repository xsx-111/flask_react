Designer Lyrics
Whatever was your angle
With that visionary shimmer?
A strange thing to roll out a spell
À la mode

Tears water the flowers of need
And you bend my day at the knee
Sit down, we'll frame the far side
Shapes live forever, designer

I give up on your beauty
Shady as the day you were born
I'm leaving you alone with it
We're going sailing
Designer


That visionary shimmer
Do not lose your young eyes
Laughing at good work with your ugly son
Give up your beauty
Oh, holy bosses leave me here
I'm diving off that memory
Stop pinning up your lives like wives
Give me your finger
À la mode
Designer

We were à la modeEmbed
