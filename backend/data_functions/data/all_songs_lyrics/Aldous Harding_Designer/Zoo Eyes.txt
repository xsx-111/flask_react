Zoo Eyes Lyrics
Why, what am I doing in Dubai?
In the prime of my life
Do you love me?
Cried all the way through
Zoo eyes, zoo eyes, zoo eyes

Zoo eyes
Ask for me and you shall receive
Opulent fair
All rain is beads
That drain to where the mother shell meets the sea

I drove my inner child to a show
It talked all the way home
And the nectar
Zoo eyes, zoo eyes, zoo eyes

Zoo eyes
Ask for me and you shall receive
Opulent fair, all sound is bees
That drift to where the covered tree has no leaves
Nice
Nice to have remembered, well, a pin
A colourful bride
They are magnificent
Do you love me?
Again
Again in the morning
In the light, a playing fight
And the nectar
Dubai, Dubai
Zoo eyes, zoo eyes, zoo eyes

Zoo eyes
Ask for me and you shall receive
Opulent fair, all fear is green
It sits above the classroom of your dreams
Zoo eyes
Ask for me and you shall receive
Opulent fair, all love is fleece
It leaves a cold lamb laughing in the breeze

It's the greatest show on Earth you shall receive
It's the greatest show on Earth you shall receive
It's the greatest show on Earth you shall receive
It's the greatest show on Earth you shall receive
It's the greatest show on Earth you shall receive
It's the greatest show on Earth you shall receive
What am I doing in Dubai?2Embed
