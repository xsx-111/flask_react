The Barrel Lyrics
I feel your love
I feel time is up
When I was a child, I never knew enough
What'd that do to me?
The wave of love is a transient hurt
Water’s the shell and we are the knot
But I saw a hand arch out of the barrel

Look at all the peaches
How do you celebrate?
Can't appear inside of nowhere

It's already dead
I know you have the dove
I’m not gettin' wet
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I'm not gettin' led along

Rushed in to hold down your page
And now I sleep 'side words you do not read with me
I hear a song from inside the maze, the very one you made
You shook at the ivory mantle
As a poet, I knew to be gentle
When you have a child, so begins the braiding
And in that braid you stay
Look at all the peaches
I want to celebrate
I can appear inside of nowhere
Look at all the peaches

It's already dead
I know you have the dove
I'm not getting wet
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I'm not getting led along

The wave of love is a transient hurt
Water’s the shell and we are the knot
But I saw a match struck outside the barrel

(The barrel)
It’s already dead
I know you have the dove
I'm not getting wet
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I’m not getting led along
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
It's already dead
I know you have the dove
I'm not getting wet
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I'm not getting led along
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)
(The barrel)6Embed
