Heaven Is Empty Lyrics
Heaven is empty
Nobody's there
I brought my camera
It stayed in its bag
People ask me all the time what I want
The answer is one
Heaven is empty

Unconditional love
A crane at the top of the lake
Iâ€™ll hang like Jesus
On my pulling bed
Heaven is empty

If a big cold bird tried to bring me a baby
I feel I would get on his back
Kissing his neck
Breathe in and out
Kissing the doubt
And whisper softly
I don't want entry
That place is empty1Embed
