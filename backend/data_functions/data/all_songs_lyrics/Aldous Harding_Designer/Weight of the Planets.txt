Weight of the Planets Lyrics
Glad I pulled the reigns on this thing when I did
I see no reason to go ahead with it
In your eyes, I see the weight of the planets
And it's sucking me out

Your stone looks hot as it starts to roll
We shared a meal and then you had to go
I've been over that night in my head
And you were psyching me out

I can do anything
No one is stopping me
I can be anything
But I've got the weight of the planets
I've got the weight of the planets, I'm lost


I'm so tempted, I just might try and look for you
If I know that you've arrived
In your eyes, I see the weight of the planets
You're lost and it's sucking you out
(Weight of the planets, you're lost)
Sucking you out
(Weight of the planets, weight)
It's sucking you out
(Weight of the planets, you're lost)
It's sucking you out
(Weight of the planets, you're lost, weight)
Sucking you out
(Weight of the planets, you're lost)
(Weight of the planets)
It's sucking you out
(Weight of the planets, you're lost)1Embed
