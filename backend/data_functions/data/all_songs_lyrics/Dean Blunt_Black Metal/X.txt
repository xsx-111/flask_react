You're messing with a holy man
Never messing with no fans
Romans in my plan
You're fucking with a holy man

So you know
Let it go, let it go, let it go
You're just another one that I know
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Can't take another one
It's not the way it's meant to go
But you've got no other place to go

Said you're messing with a holy man
So you know
Let it go, let it go, let it go
You're just another one that I know
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Can't take another one
It's not the way it's meant to go
But you've got no other place to go

You're fucking with a holy man
Never messing with no fans
You're messing with a-
The bees in the trap
Says she's never coming back
The bees in the trap
Say she ain't ever coming back

So roll these trees for the
G's in the back
A nigga's never coming back
So pour some liquor
Reload the trap
Ain't ever coming back

And Beyonc√© meant guys like me when she said 'soldier'
A gangster type, when your husband leaves you
Pull up outside, in a silver rover
Until this life is over
Get money rolling over1Embed
