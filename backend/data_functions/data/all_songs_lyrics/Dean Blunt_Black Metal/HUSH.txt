HUSH Lyrics
Girl, you really had a lot
Shop? A nigga don't shop
You girls want cotch?
Cause your bodies feelin' hot
Smile, I known you for a while
But I haven't seen you in a while
Gonna leave in a while
So come home for a while
Girl, I haven't seen you in a minute
One minute
Girl, gonna see you when I leave
Know you wanna leave with a g
For all the niggas that knew me
Sue meEmbed
