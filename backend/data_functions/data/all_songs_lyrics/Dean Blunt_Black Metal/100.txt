Over my shoulder
I'm dying to meet you
But everybody says I'm wrong
Said I'm dying to meet you, girl
But everybody says I'm wrong
Everybody says I'm wrong
But we keep it going on
Feelings coming on
But the bullshit got too long, yeah

Over my shoulder
I'm dying to meet you
Though everybody says I'm wrong
Over my shoulder
I'm dying to meet you
Though everybody says I'm wrong2Embed
