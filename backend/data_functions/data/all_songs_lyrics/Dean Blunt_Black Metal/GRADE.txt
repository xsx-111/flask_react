GRADE Lyrics
 into dust
Baby, ta-ake me out
See if you can
See if can

You're not a rerun
Not just another one
You're a new friend
It just began
Who's up tonight?
Whose girl gonna get picked up tonight?
Who's opened out?
Look at me, look at me
Bad man wanna be me
Look at me, look at me
Bad man wanna be me

 into dust
Baby, take charge

But who's hot tonight?
Whose girl gonna get picked up tonight?
But it's just another one
Pull it back for another one
And I'm gone, gone, gone...Embed
