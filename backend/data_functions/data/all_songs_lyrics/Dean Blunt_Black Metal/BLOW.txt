BLOW LyricsPlease don't get involved
'Cause I don't want you helping
It is not my fault
That I don't want you helping, no
So I run away
When I run away
Ain't nobody gonna find me
They search every day
No redemption ever could help me, no
So back into the past
I don't need nobody helping
Yeah
Now I feel okay
Molly water flowing in my dome
I just want to say
All this money really cured my woes
So look around me now
How you even gonna help me
'Cause baby, I'm the man
Back into the past
I don't need nobody helpingEmbed
