MERSH Lyrics
I'm with them
But never on the weekend
It's a problem
I'm the one when it's all gone
It's a new thing
You're an a-team
So what's the problem?
I'm the one when it's all gone
Go and leave then
Best believe them
It's not a problem

Ten bodies in the back
Heart attack
Had about four
Tryna add one more
But only on the weekendEmbed
