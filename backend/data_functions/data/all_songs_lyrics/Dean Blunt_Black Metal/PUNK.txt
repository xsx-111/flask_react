PUNK Lyrics
Speak before it goes away
I can't go another day
I know what she's gonna say
Just to make me go away
This is how it's gonna be
I'm not who I'm meant to be

Drinks and drinks and drinks and drinks
Then I gotta hold her hair

Sho-be-do-be-do-be-do
Sho-be-do-be-do-be-do
Sho-be-do-be-do-be-do
Sho-be-do-be-do-be-do

Feds are closing in on me
Everybody knows it's me
What else can I do but hide?

Asking me to settle down
Wanted me to solve it now
I hope you know it's all a lieEmbed
