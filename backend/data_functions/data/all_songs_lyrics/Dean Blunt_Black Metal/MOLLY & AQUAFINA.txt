MOLLY & AQUAFINA Lyrics
La la la la la
La
La la la la la
La la la

Riding through these streets
I'm strapped up with my nina
So I ain't worried 'bout nothing
I don't worry 'bout nothing
I ain't worried 'bout nothing
I don't worry 'bout nothing
See I ain't worried 'bout nothing

Lady don't go
I think it's time you should know
It's not the way things should go
Cause you'll never be
The one I want you to be
Cause I know that person is me

Riding through these streets
I'm strapped up with my nina
So I ain't worried 'bout nothing
I don't worry 'bout nothing
I ain't worried 'bout nothing
I don't worry 'bout nothing
See I ain't worried 'bout nothing
I ain't worried 'bout nothing
Ain't worried 'bout nothing
I don't worry 'bout nothingEmbed
