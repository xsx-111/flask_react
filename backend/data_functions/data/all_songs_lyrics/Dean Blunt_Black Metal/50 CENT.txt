50 CENT Lyrics
Why I want a girl who doesn't want me back
I cannot believe you
Try letting go but I can't relax
You're back again, you're back again
She got a new nigga, now he can't be found

5-0 coming and they know my name
I can not believe you
Got a new girl ridin' and I hope she game
Are back again, you're back again
In these streets, we got no shame
I cannot believe you
Are back again, you're back again
I cannot believe you
Are back again, you're back again

With someone else
Then to look away
Never watching out

All my niggas who think they knew
If you know how I feel
Never mess with explosives, yeah
Yeah
Back again, back againEmbed
