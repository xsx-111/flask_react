Live Every Moment LyricsLive every moment
Love every day
'Cause before you know it
Your precious time slips away
Live every moment
Love every day
'Cause if you don't you might
Just throw your love away
I walked for seven miles this mornin'
Footprints in the sand
Washed away without a warning
When the water hit the land
But I will walk on
'Til I can no longer stand
I'll take you by the hand
And we'll live every moment
Love every day
'Cause before you know it
Your precious time slips away
There's water in the wind tonight
There's a chill in the air
It's coolin' down my skin tonight
Soakin' through your hair
There's warmth enough within tonight
For both of us to share
We can take it anywhere
And we'll live every moment
Love every day
'Cause if you don't you might
Just throw your love away
Sometimes I wish we could
Take a trip far away
Leave all this trouble and heartache
And pain for another day
I will search for that place
But 'til I find it all I can say
Is live every moment
And love every day
Oooh, sometimes I wish we could
Take a trip far away
Leave all this trouble and heartache
And pain for another day
I will search for that place
But 'til I find it all I can say
Is live every moment
Love every day
'Cause before you know it
Your precious time slips away
Live every moment
Love every day
'Cause if you don't you might
Just throw your love away
You might
Just throw your love away
You might
Just throw your love away
You got to live every moment
You got to, you got to
You got to, you got to
You got to live every momentEmbed
