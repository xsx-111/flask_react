One Lonely Night LyricsYou and your baby
Had some words today
Til not another word
Was left to say
I see that grin, boy
Maybe you think you'll win, boy
Until the sun goes down
And once again, boy
One lonely night
One lonely night
That's all it takes to
Completely break you
They say it's darkest
Right before the dawn
But, oh, those darkest hours
Can be so long
You're feelin' strong, boy
Tellin' yourself she's wrong, boy
But how much longer can
This night go on, boy
One lonely night
One lonely night
That's all it takes to
Completely break you
One lonely night
One lonely night
That's all it takes to
Completely break you
Ooh, she's such a good find
Have you gone and lost your mind
You should know she's one of a kind
Ooh, she's such a good find
Have you gone and lost your mind
You should know she's one of a kind
Just one lonely night
One lonely night
That's all it takes to
Completely break youEmbed
