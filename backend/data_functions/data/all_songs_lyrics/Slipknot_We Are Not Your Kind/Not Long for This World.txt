Not Long for This World Lyrics
Cutting or scratching, they scar the same
The angle is off, edges are soft, the mark remains
I know I'm bitter and full of rage
You would be too, what I've been through
Knowledge is a difficult age

So decide, tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide, tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see
Not long for this world

Carving or biting, we bleed for keeps
Out of control, into the cold, hell repeats
God, I'm starving, spreading me thin
Buying a story, my soul was for sale, trust is such an arrogant thing

So decide, tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide, tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see
Not long for this world
Not long for this world
I know the shit you eat
There's nothing mellow in the drama you live and breathe
You like your secrets to be kept in the family
You don't get credit for your rare good behavior
Go be a savior
You don't seem to get what I'm saying
And I'm sick and tired of explaining
Good night, goodbye, good luck
There's nothing worse than a ghoul manifesto
I'm not impressed though

The greatest conclusion that I ever had
Was when I woke up and said that's enough
Living never felt so bad
You don't accept it and I don't care
Bury yourself above all your guilt
When you're ready, it'll be there

So decide, tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide, tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see
Not long for this world
Not long for this world
Not long for this world
I was not long for this world
I was not long for this world
I was not long for this world
I was not long for this world
I was not long for this world
I was not long for this world1Embed
