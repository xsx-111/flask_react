Formaldehyde LyricsI can see wind upon the rise, here under glass I can see
Outside in formaldehyde waiting to set myself free
Up around the river bend I was separated from you
You became a citizen of a world held like a zoo
One step through the airlock
Where the chemicals can't get through
Up around the river bend I was separated from you
Like the ocean drips from the sky I sit here just waiting to be
I can see specimens in the jars, waiting to be
Up around the river bend the specialists changed you
You became a prisoner of a world kept like a zoo
Outside, real life – waiting for you and for me
Outside all our lives – awaiting the chance to be
Get away from me, get away from me now – it's all wrong
It's too late for me, it's too late for me now – it's all gone, you have gone
Will you pray for me, will you pray for me now – all night long
Up around the river bend
Up around the river bend Satan's angels fly
Hey everybody don't you know we can go outside
Yeah, we can party in the formaldehyde
