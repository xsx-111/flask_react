The Doctrine of Eternal Ice (Part Two) LyricsDo you wait for me, do you wait for me now
All time long - all night long
Do you wait for me, will you wait for me now
All night long - all night long
Innocent? It could go either way
"Satan" has come again
Bringing some of his friends
He has won - his boys are having fun
Hatred, i can see you've won this time
Satan's angels swarm to catch the tide
Satan's angels fly
I'm only dreaming of a time when i'll survive
I'm only thinking of a way to turn back time
I'm only weeping 'cause the sounds
That rang around have all died down
Climbing up the fire escape
I cannot move but that's okay
I tell myself that you'll be here
I'll wait for you, i'll wait for you
Bring down the rainEmbed
