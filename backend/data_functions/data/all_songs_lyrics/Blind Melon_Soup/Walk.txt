Walk Lyrics
Find myself singing the same songs everyday, yeah
Ones that make me feel good
When things behind a smile ain't okay
Around and over and in-between the seas
I need to be on top of a mountain
Where I can be see everything
Cause this paranoia's getting old
Ooh yeah, it's getting old


Now, as I open my eyes to start another day, yeah
I'm in a pile of puke
Empty bag of excuses
My love for friends and family
You know I need them
And under a sun that's seen it all before
My feet are so cold
And I can't believe
That I have to bang my head against this wall again
But, the blows, they have just a little more space in-between them
Gonna take a breath and try
And try again1Embed
