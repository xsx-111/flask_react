Vernie Lyrics
Is it the way you're speakin'?
Is it because I'm peakin'?
Twistin' your face, thumb in hand

But you gotta have your own space to play in
A collection of glass chickens
Oh, Vernie, what a garden you have

Maybe its the snuff under your lip
Or maybe caramel cake covered in Christmas
Oh, a flower, you are, to my land
But I-

No, I cannot deny the beauty
If I had a heart, I would want it to be like Vernie's
Oh, what a heart that she has

Roaming through the cupboard
Jar of pickles never opened since 1983
Peanuts in a pile
And Elvis down the aisle, singing gallantly
I wish I could be, I wish I could be, I wish I could be
I wish I could be, I wish I could be a little more like Vernie
Oh, I wanna be
I wanna be a little more like VernieEmbed
