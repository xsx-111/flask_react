New Life Lyrics
Suddenly, everyting is fainting
Falling from a broken ladder's rung
There's a jolt exhilarating from the phone I'm holding
I hear the words of what I'll become
How eager, the hands that reach for love

'Cause now there's a new life to behold
And its the biggest part of my life to unfold

'Cause now she's telling me she'll have my baby
And a faithful father I am to be
When I'm looking into the eyes of our own baby
Will it bring new life into me?

Deep inside, must defy arrangement
I've been a-stumblin' from the startin' blocks 'til now
And I'll always try to justify the way I've been behaving
Should I teach one not to know how?
How to live in a world we live in now

'Cause there's a beautiful life to behold
And its the biggest part of my life to unfold
'Cause now she's telling me she'll have my baby
And a father figure I am to be
When I'm looking into the eyes of our own baby
Will it bring new life into me?
Oh please
Oh please
Oh please
Bring new life
Bring new life
Bring new life into meEmbed
