The Duke Lyrics
Out here in nothin', engulfed by the sea
And there's no one here, except these fishes and me
I think I could die here
Then I'm hit, leveled hard by the rising tide

Oh, I'm hit hard by the tide
I'm just livid
All alone

Sunny, so funny, not funny to me because
I'm bearing the scars from it burning on me
But I feel so revived
Just sittin' here, thinkin'
Then I'm hit hard, really hard by the tide

I'm hit hard by the tide
I'm just livid
And I'm livin'


Yeah, I'm hit hard by the tide
I'm livid, livid
Hard by the tide
I'm livin'
All aloneEmbed
