Skinned Lyrics
I'll make a shoehorn outta your shin
I'll make a lampshade of durable skin
And, oh, don't you know that I'm always feeling able
When I'm sitting home and I'm carving out your navel?
I'm just a sitting here carving out your navel

When will I realize that this skin I'm in, hey, it isn't mine?
And when will the kill be too much meat for me to hide?

Hey, I could really use a couple of hands
To complete one hell of a plant stand
Oh, and don't you know that I'm caught here in the middle
Making rib cages into coffee tables?
I'm just making 'em into coffee tables

And when will I realize that this skin I'm in, hey, it isn't mine?
And when will the thrill be too much meat for me to find anymore?

Oh, because you know I can't hide, but, oh, how hard I try
But this is just the shape I'm in
Although I know I can't hide, but, oh, how hard I try
But this is just the shape I'm in, oh yeah, oh yeahEmbed
