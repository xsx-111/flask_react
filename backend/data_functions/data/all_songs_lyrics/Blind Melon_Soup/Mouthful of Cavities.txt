Mouthful of Cavities Lyrics(Listen man I got the window open, hear the cats? Listen)

Mouthful of cavities
And your soul's a bowl of jokes
And everyday you remind me
How I'm desperately in need
See, I got a lot of fiends around
And they're peeking through and nothing new
And they see you, they see everything you do
(Everything you do)

Seein' everything on the inside out

Oh, please give me a little more
And I'll push away those baby blues
'Cause, one of these days, this will die
So will me, and so will you
I write a letter to a friend of mine
And tell him how much I used to love to watch him smile
See, I haven't seen him smile in a little while
Haven't seen him smile in a little while

But I know you're laughing from the inside, out
Laughing from the inside, out
I know you're laughing on the inside, out
Laughing from the inside, the inside, the inside, out2Embed
