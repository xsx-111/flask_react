Hello, Goodbye/Galaxie Lyrics
I'm entering a frame bombarded by indecision
Where a man like me can easily let the day get out of control
Down this far in the quarter
I'm pushed hard upon the border
But I'd rather be caught around now
Instead of, oh say, 'round the month of June
But if I can leave with a little bit of explanation
Then, anywhere in the world I choose to go, I'll have it made

Is this the place that I want to be?
Is it you, who I want to see?
Holding on, hold it high, show me everything

And you're leaving me
Yeah, you're leaving me
You're leaving me with a hated identity

But I keep on a-comin' here and standing in this state
Oh, and I'm never really sure if you'll take what I'm saying the right way
But I'm not appalled or afraid
Verbal pocket play
Is as discreet as I can muster up to be
Because the Cadillac that's sittin' in the back
It isn't me
Oh, no, no, no it isn't me
I'm more at home in my Galaxie
Oh yeah
Can I do the things I wanna do
That I don't do, because of you?
And I'll take a left and I'll second guess
Into total mess

And you're leaving me
Yeah, you're leaving me
You're leaving me with a hated identity

But I keep on a-comin' here and standing in this state
Oh and I'm always reassured the situation's getting carried away
But I'm not appalled or afraid
Verbal pocket play
Is as discreet as I can muster up to be
Because the Cadillac that's sittin' in the back
It isn't me
Oh, no, no, no it isn't me
Oh, no, no, no it isn't me
No it isn't me
No it isn't me
No it isn't me
No, no it isn't me
No it isn't me
