2x4 Lyrics
I'm talkin'
I'm talkin'
I'm talkin' to myself boy

Needle, fetal
Someone's pouring warm gravy all over me
And you see that synthetic therapy
Don't you know, it seems to be so unappealing
But, oh what a feeling

I wish that you would stop spitting
When you're talking to me

And inside, air dry
I might want to go another way
But you see now, I'm too pale to get out

Into the lovely light of day
Oh, I'll do anything that you say
Oh, I'll do anything that you say
But I wish you would stop spitting
When you're talking to me
 (x6)
I'm talking to myself boy
One by one

Man to man
Stand to stand
Two by four
Talkin' to myselfEmbed
