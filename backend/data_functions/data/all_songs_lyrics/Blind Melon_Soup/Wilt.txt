Wilt Lyrics
Hair-raising shake, you're much too late
You should have jumped a couple of cars before
Now, if I may, I'll walk away
I'm selling Silly Putty door-to-door
And up on the shelf, it seems to help
If I can keep a little bit of disease
As it's feeding on me

You see it's bringing me to my knees
As we all wilt

Watching you wilt

Come right away
And help me bathe away the filthy feeling, frigid and cold
Biting my nails to the fairy tales
About the magic monkey's total control
See, I got Indian Ken and his fleabag friends
With their buckets full of elephant ears
As he's breathing on me

His breath is bringing me to my knees
As we all wilt
Watching you wilt
Pea green the feelingEmbed
