Dumptruck Lyrics
New York City soothing my
Itchy, itchy month of May
Time has passed for Ms. Onassis
Decay on display

I don't want to go down
I don't want to go down
I don't want to go down like she did
And I can't understand why
Something good's got to die, before we miss it

Mumbled talk through pigeon park
And Hastings is wasting away
Religiously, they seem to sin
Buy, sell or trade for amens

I just don't want to feel
I just don't want to feel
I just don't want to feel like they feel
Hollow body for sound
Trade my coat for a gown
You're now way up in my arms, you know I love you
Just a little bit, little bit, little bit more


Raisin' nose down to chin
Smoke after smoke, they all trickle in
Anything for anything
And ending up with nothing

Simple, pimpled young man
Sores all over his hands
He's sleeping, not so silently
I'll mop the floors for you all
I'm that fly on the wall
Really big and listenin'

Burned the hand of a friend of mine
And know, Bub, I know that you could fly a mile high
You told me nothing's ever gonna come between
An' nothing's ever gonna come between
An' nothing's ever gonna come between
My dumptruck and meEmbed
