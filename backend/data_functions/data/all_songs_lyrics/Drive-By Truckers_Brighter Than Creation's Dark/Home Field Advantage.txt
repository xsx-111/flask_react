Home Field Advantage Lyrics
You ain't much of a player
And you ain't playin' for free
You just know all the chatter
And you've been chattin' at me

Now you're takin' me down
With a home field advantage
And you're callin' me out
With a home field advantage

You may have thrown me a curveball
You threw a doozie at me
You ain't too fast cause you're so tall
You threw a doozie at me

And now you're takin' me down
With a home field advantage
And you're callin' me out
With a home field advantage

You don't know what to do
Yeah, you're lookin' around
Nobody's at home
And you don't know the count
Well, you break and run
Just to tie it up
Yeah you're takin' me down
With a home field advantage
And you're callin' me out
With a home field advantageEmbed
