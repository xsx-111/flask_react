The Purgatory Line LyricsThis ain't exactly hell
It sure as hell ain't heaven
I love you like the dickens
Miss you like the Devil
And I guess I'll do my time
Waitin' in this purgatory line
Angels here are wearin'
Fancy new perfume
And all the bread's unleavened
I guess it'll have to do
'Til I find you
I don't know what I'm doin' here or why
Waitin' in this purgatory line
I ain't exactly up
I ain't gone too far down
I'm looking for some answers
And there ain't no one around
I guess I'll just lose my mind
Waitin' in this purgatory line
If Jesus walked on water
Then where'd he get them shoes?
It just keeps gettin' harder
To lose these walkin' blues
And I want you
To come and take me home for a while
Save me from this purgatory line
Sometimes I can laugh
Other times I cry
Ain't exactly funny
My feet are both on fire
Guess they'll burn for a while
Waitin' in this purgatory line
Lovin' you's so easy
But waitin' here just ain't
I know I can be patient
But please don't hesitate
To cross my mind
That's all I've got for a while
Waitin' in this purgatory lineEmbed
