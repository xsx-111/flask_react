Checkout Time In Vegas LyricsA bloody nose, empty pockets
A rented car with a trunk full of guns
It ain't true that the sun don't rise in Vegas
I've seen it once
She might have been somebody's mama
He might have been somebody's son
But if the sun went down on them that night in Vegas
Their luck was good as gone
They'll be after me by the time the buffet closes
Making sure Sin City still shines brighter than creation's dark
If all you need's a badge to take what's left from those who lost it
A badge ain't no more real than bullets are
A bloody nose, empty pockets
A rented car with a trunk full of guns
Checkout time is sundown in Las Vegas
But it only rises onceEmbed
