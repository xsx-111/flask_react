Daddy Needs A Drink Lyrics
Daddy needs a drink
To deal with all the beauty
To deal with all the madness
To keep from blowing up
Daddy needs a drink
To calm down his badness
To execute his gladness
On the fullness of his cup
Daddy needs a drink
To keep the wheels from rubbing
To compensate for nothing
Or nothing going on

Daddy needs a drink
So Mama, fix one quick
Pour it nice and strong
With your cleaning outfit on
Daddy needs a drink
So Mama, fix one quick
Pour it nice and strong
With your cleaning outfit on

Daddy needs a drink
To hem in all his demons
To hear through baby screaming
Or the TV set turned on
Ain't nothing on the radio
Like the wave my transmitter's on
Put that drinking jacket on
And enjoy a little fog
Daddy needs a drink
So Mama, fix one quick
Pour it nice and strong
With your cleaning outfit on
Daddy needs a drink
So Mama, fix one quick
Pour it nice and strong
With your cleaning outfit onEmbed
