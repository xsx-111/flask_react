You And Your Crystal Meth LyricsYou've become such a mess
You and your crystal meth
You lost your family, wrecked your truck
I used to love you, now you suck
We were friends, among the best
You and your crystal meth
I ain't exactly a no-drug guy
Don't dig the way that you get high
Hope your kids don't see you throwing up
Hope they ain't there if the house blows up
Hope you ain't murdered in your sleep
Up all night with that cranked-out creep
You ain't eaten, you ain't slept
You and your crystal meth
Indiana, Alabama
Oklahoma, Arizona
Texas, Florida, Ohio
Small town America, right next door
Blood soaked your pillow red
You and your crystal meth
You and your crystal meth
You and your crystal methEmbed
