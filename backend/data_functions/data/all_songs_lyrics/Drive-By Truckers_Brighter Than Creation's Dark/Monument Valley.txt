Monument Valley LyricsIt's all about where you put the horizon
Said the great John Ford to the young man rising
Gotta frame it just right and have some luck, of course
It helps to have a tall man ridin' on the horse
Tell 'em just enough to still leave them some mystery
And a grasp of the ironic nature of history
A man turns his back on the comforts of home
The Monument Valley to ride off alone
And when the dust all settles and the story's told
History is made by the side of the road
By the men and women that can persevere
And rage through the storm, no matter how severe
And whether it's a horse or a car or a train
There's gonna be some fine times and there's gonna be some pain
In the end it's a silhouette framed by the sun
Just The Monument Valley when the evening comes
And it's a strong wind blowing on the open range
It's gonna be beautiful, it's gonna be strange
It's where to plant the camera and when to say "Action!"
When to print the legend and when to leave the facts in
You turn your back on the comforts of home
And wander 'round The Monument Valley aloneEmbed
