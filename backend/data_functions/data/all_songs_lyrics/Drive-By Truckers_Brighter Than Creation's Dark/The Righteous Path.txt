The Righteous Path LyricsI got a brand new car that drinks a bunch of gas
Got a house in a neighborhood that's fading fast
Got a dog and a cat that don't fight too much
Got a few hundred channels to keep me in touch
Got a beautiful wife and three tow-headed kids
A couple of big secrets I'd kill to keep hid
I don't know God but I fear his wrath
I'm trying to stay focused on the righteous path
I got a couple of opinions that I hold dear
Got a whole lot of debt and a whole lot of fear
Got an itch that needs scratching but it feels alright
Got the need to blow it out on a Saturday night
Got a grill in the backyard and a case of beers
Got a boat that ain't seen the water in years
More bills than money, I can do the math
I'm trying to keep focused on the righteous path
I'm trying to keep focused as I drive down the road
On the ditches and the curves and the heavy load
Ain't bitchin' 'bout things that aren't in my grasp
Just trying to hold steady on the righteous path
There's this friend of mine I've known all my life
Who can't get it right no matter how hard he tries
Got kids he don't see and several ex-wives
And a list of bad decisions 'bout eight miles wide
Trouble with the law and the IRS
And where he'll get the money's anybody's guess
He's a long way off but if you was to ask
He'd say "I'm trying to stay on the righteous path"
I'm trying to keep focused as we drive down the road
Like back in high school before the world turned cold
Now the brakes are thin and the curves are fast
We're trying to hold steady on the righteous path
We're hanging out and we're hanging on
We're trying the best we can to keep keeping on
We got messed-up minds for these messed-up times
And it's a thin, thin line separatin' his from mine
Trying to hold steady on the righteous path
Eighty miles an hour with a worn-out map
No time for self-pity or a load of crap
Just trying to stay focused on the righteous pathEmbed
