The Home Front LyricsThe hours creep across the face as she paces 'cross the floor
She can't even get to sleep since Tony went to war
She feels bitch-slapped and abandoned by a world she thought she knew
Cold beyond comprehension as their little girl turns two
And now they're saying on the flat screen they ain't found the reason yet
We're all bogged down in a quagmire and there ain't no end to it
No Nine-Eleven or Uranium to pin this bullshit on
She's left standing on the home front, the two of them aloneEmbed
