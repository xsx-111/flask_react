That Man I Shot LyricsThat man I shot
He was trying to kill me
He was trying to kill me
He was trying to kill me
That man I shot
I didn't know him
I was doing my job
Maybe so was he
That man I shot
I was in his homeland
I was there to help him
But he didn't want me there
I did not hate him
I still don't hate him
He was trying to kill me
And I had to take him down
That man I shot
I still can see him
When I should be sleeping
Tossing and turning
He's looking at me
Eyes looking through me
Broke out in cold sweats
When I see him standing there
That man I shot
Shot not in anger
There's no denying
It was in self-defense
But when I close my eyes
I still can see him
I feel his last breath
In the calm dead of night
That man I shot
He was trying to kill me
He was trying to kill me
He was trying to kill me
Sometimes I wonder
If I should be there
I hold my little ones
Until he disappears
I hold my little ones
Until he disappears
I hold my little ones
Until we disappear
And I'm not crazy
Or at least I never was
But there's this big thing
I can't get rid of
That man I shot
Did he have little ones
That he was so proud of
That he won't see grow up?
Was walking down his street?
Maybe I was in his yard
Was trying to do good
I just don't understand
I just don't understand
I just don't understandEmbed
