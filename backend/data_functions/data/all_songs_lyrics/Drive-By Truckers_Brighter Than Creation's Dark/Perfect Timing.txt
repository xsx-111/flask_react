Perfect Timing LyricsHere I am again, perfect timing
The strings are ringing and the words are rhyming
I used to hate the fool in me, but only in the morning
Now I tolerate him all day long
Out on the highway I hear the moaning
That low and lonesome whisper you only know from longing
Through those naked trees at the windows glowing orange
Taking over that cold shoulder racing by
I might have known before
If I'd got this old before
I thought I got too cool to give a damn
That who you see in dreams at night
Seem to spend their afterlives
Trying hard to live the last one down
Here I am again, perfect timing
The strings are ringing and the words are rhyming
I used to hate the fool in me, but only in the morning
Now I tolerate him all day longEmbed
