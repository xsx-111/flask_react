3 Dimes Down LyricsIt was a straight shot
All it took was luck to not get caught
I laid three dimes down and the machine wanted twenty-five cents
In the back seat, her and a friend
One out the window and the other on the other end
One belt loop away from Sunday night's news
If the part about being who he was didn't help Tom get loose
What's a guy without a T. gonna get? Totally screwed
While chicken wing puke eats the candy apple red off his Corvette
Three dimes down and twenty-five cents
Shy of a slice of the Doublemint Twins
Come back, baby, rock-n-roll never forgetsEmbed
