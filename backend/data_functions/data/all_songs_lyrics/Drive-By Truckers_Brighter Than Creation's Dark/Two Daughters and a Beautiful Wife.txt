Two Daughters and a Beautiful Wife Lyrics
When he reached the gates of heaven
He didn't understand
He knew that friends were coming over
Or was it all a dream?
Was it all a crazy dream?

He saw them playing there before him
What were they doing there?
It felt like home, it must be alright
Or was it all a dream?
Was it all a crazy dream?

Memories replay before him
All the tiny moments of his life
Lying 'round in bed on a Saturday morning
Two daughters and a wife
Two daughters and a beautiful wife

Meanwhile on Earth his friends come over
Shocked and horrified
Dolls and flowers by the storefront
And everybody cried
Everybody cried and cried
Is there vengeance up in heaven?
Or are those things left behind?
Maybe every day is Saturday morning
Two daughters and a wife
Two daughters and a beautiful wife
Two daughters and a beautiful wifeEmbed
