Learning Lyrics
No one will answer your prayers
Until you take off that dress
No one will hear all your crying
Until you take your last breath

But you will learn
To mind me
And you will learn
To survive me

No one will answer your prayers
Until you take off that dress
No one will hear all your crying
Until you take your last breath

But you will learn
To mind me
And you will learn
To survive me

Your father before you
And your sister too
Your husband and blah, blah, blah, blah
YouEmbed
