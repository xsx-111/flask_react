Write to Your Brother Lyrics
Mary, you should write to your brother
Every night until he recovers
In the letter press a fresh flower
And bless it with a higher power

Tell him mom treats you like a lover
That you have to hide all the mouthwash from her
And seal it with three closed-mouth kisses
And write "do not open 'til Christmas"Embed
