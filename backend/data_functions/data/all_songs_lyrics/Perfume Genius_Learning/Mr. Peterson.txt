Mr. Peterson Lyrics
My work came back from class
With notes attached
Of a place and time
Or how my body kept him up at night

He let me smoke weed in his truck
If I could convince him I loved him enough
Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough, enough

He made me a tape of Joy Division
He told there was a part of him missing
When I was sixteen
He jumped off a building

Mister Peterson
I know you were ready to go
I hope thereâ€™s room for you up above
Or down below2Embed
