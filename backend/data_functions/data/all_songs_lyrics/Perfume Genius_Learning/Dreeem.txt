Dreeem LyricsI had this dream
And you were there
Swimming in some spring
You were bald and smiling
And swinging from the reeds
While they were whistling
My face melted away
You were there
You still knew my name
And you still held me exactly the same way
Nothing had really changed
Except my face had melted away
If you were here right now
I wouldn't have to write it down
I would just sing for a moment
And let you listenEmbed
