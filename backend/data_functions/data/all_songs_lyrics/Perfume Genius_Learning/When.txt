When Lyrics
She will go out on the yard
Holding her small daughter in her arms
Above the line of the trees
Above the end of the street
She will see it rise

Gold ball
Large as a giant
Planet starting to lift up over ours
She will go out in the yard
Holding her daughter
Looking at it rise
Glow, blossom and riseEmbed
