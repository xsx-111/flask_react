Mama Kin Lyrics

It ain't easy living like a gypsy
Tell you, honey, how I feel
I've been dreaming, floating down the stream, and
Losing touch with all that's real
Whole earth lover keeping undercover
Never know where you've been
You've been fading, always out parading
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Well you've always got your tail on the wag
Shooting fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out because someday soon
You'll have to climb back on the wagon

It isn't easy living like you wanna
It's so hard to find peace of mind, yes, it is
The way I see it, you've got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

Said, you're bald as an egg when you're eighteen
And working for your dad is just a drag
You still stuff your mind with your dreams
You better check it out
Or someday soon you'll have to
Climb back on the wagon
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea


It isn't easy living like you wanna
It's so hard to find peace of mind, yes, it is
The way I see it, you've got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

Said, you're bald as an egg when you're eighteen
Working for your dad is just a drag
You still stuff your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out
Because someday soon you'll have to
Climb back on the wagon
Keeping up Mama Kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
I said I'll tell her where you've gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea1Embed
