One Way Street Lyrics
Hey look yonder
What's that I see
Well that old bogus honey
Coming after me
I thought you told her
I was out of town
I wonder how she know'd
I was hanging around
Say, listen baby
Don't go wasting your time
You keep a-comin' 'round
You'll hear the same old line
You got a thousand boys
You say you need 'em
You take what's good for you
And I'll take my freedom

Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)
I thought I knew her
My cagey lady
How could my sunshine
Be so damn shady
She'll say she loves to talk
A conversation
But I'm the one
Who makes my situation
It's one way city, mmh
And I thought I knew
It's such a pity, honey
I'm dancing for you

Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)

(Ha ha ha, you know what I'm talking about baby)
(I've seen that butterfly you tattooed on your pants)
(I'm gonna ge' me some of that yeah-heh-heh!)
There's nothing over here
I never showed you
I made it pretty clear
I'm glad to know you
You know your brother Spike
He's on the level
But you always looking
Like you're mad at the devil
Don't say I copped a 'tude
It's all forgotten
It's just you're much too rude
Your fruits are rotten
You know I work so hard to keep it alive
Now all I hear from you
Is nothing but jive

Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)
Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)

You're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
You got to get yourself back on your feet
Yeah baby
Oh baby
Lovin everybody yoo-hoo
Come at everybody
Chewin' everybody
Foolin' everybody
Lovin' everybody
Leavin' everybody yoo-hooEmbed
