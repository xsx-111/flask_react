Chip Away the Stone Lyrics
Well you're acting like a prima donna
Playing so hard to get
Acting so cool and nonchalant
Dragging on a cigarette
You keep a wall all around you
I'll get through some day
I want your love babe, but push don't shove
Going to chip that stone away

Chip away
Chip away at the stone
And I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away
That's what I'm going to do
Sweet little mama I want to get next to you

Well you stand like a marble statue
Trying to look so hard
All decked out in your antique dress
While the boys all promenade
Even a rock will crumble
If you strike it night and day
If hammer I must, I'm going to get through your crust
Going to chip that stone away

Chip away
Chip away at the stone
And I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away
That's what I'm going to do
Sweet little mama I want to get next to you
Oooh...yes I do

Chip away
At the stone
Chip away
At the stone

I won't stop
Won't stopEmbed
