Wake Me Up Before I Sleep LyricsWake me up before I sleep and I'll promise you that I'll concentrate
On only the last frame
Cover only one sound
Some kinda sweet, weird kinda strange around me
Wake me up before I sleep
Can't you see too many colours here, colours there, colours everywhere
Cover only one ground, the blackest of blacks I don't want to surround me
There's nothing I can say, that isn't gonna be
There's nothing I can do, that isn't gonna be a mistake
Wake me up before I sleep now
I haven't had an inch of what I thought I got from this awful high
Cover me in one dye
Just lie here with me we'll let the train go by
There's nothing I can say, that isn't gonna be
There's nothing in my way, I know it's gonna be a mistakeEmbed
