Guilty Pleasures Lyrics{That's a really nice sound
That's a nice sound
That's what I call a nice sound}
Wanting, missing
Having, letting
Knowing, forgetting
Showing, climbing
Falling, sucking
Breathing, lying
Loosing, missing
You make me feel
Happy, clumsy
Angry, rash
Cripple, silly
Little, smaller
Taller, witty
Hasty, s***
Weary, ugly
You make me feel
In there, neither
Someone, several
All round, in time
More off, instant
More like, therefore
Pinned on, hardly
In there, often
You make me feel
Envy, fucking
Waisting, sighing
Coping, bragging
Coughing, dying
Laughing, plastifying and crying
You make me feel
My sister
Got nowhere to hide
I missed her
But deep down inside
We drive
Keep our hands on the wheel
We drive
You know how it feels
In my dream, on my back
On those pills, make it till
By the sea
You make me feel
On my left, by my side
On your lap, heavy foot
Hurt and heal
You make me feel
Blinded by, ready for
Always yours, cardiac
Filthy, guilty pleasure
You make me feel
My sister
Got nowhere to hide
I missed her
But deep down inside
We drive
Keep our hands on the wheel
We drive
You know how it feels
My sisterEmbed
