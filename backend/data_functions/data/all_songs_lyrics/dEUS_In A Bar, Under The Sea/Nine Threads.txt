Nine Threads LyricsStone go slow
Find the right moment to stop the show
The nighttime gets weary of implecations afterglow
Thinking: "Easy come, easy go"
You got here too late, it's often so
I guess that's why
I hope I get old before I die
Admit it turned out okay for someone who didn't try
Thinking it's time to get a hold
You got here too late, it's always so
It's always so, it's always so
It's always so, it's always soEmbed
