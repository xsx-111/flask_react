Fell Off The Floor, Man Lyrics{What about my philosophy, my philosophy}
{You got to be your, you got to be your own dog, you know?}
{You know what I'm talking about?}
{You're supposed to say yeah like a James Brown thing. Yeah}
{You gotta go sniffin' in your own turf}
{Be your own dog, don't let nobody put a leash on you}
Rubbadub a tub fish (Ping pong)
Sneakin' in the dead zone (Boneyard)
Sippin' on a catlap (Sing song)
Trimming off my nostril hairs (Headcase)
An angel in a mellowcake (Car crash)
Rubbin' like a pussycat (Gridlock)
A stone within my eyeball (Too too)
Dancin' with my socks on (Oh man)
Singin' like a tomtit (Stop cab)
-----??----------------(Tip top)
Entering a smoky barroom (Hey you)
Smuggling a wombat (Rubbaday)
Chewing on my necktie (Tweedo)
Tumbling in the margerine (Heroine)
Hidden in the ribbongrass (Too too)
Actin' like a baby (Headcase)
I don't need no thoughts in me, don't you wanna rescue me?
There's a little light below, go there when I want to go
Wanted by the bumbledom (Ping pong)
Trying to pry the red shoes off (Headcase)
Licking on my ice cream cone (Heroine)
Surfing in the kitchen sink (Rubbaday)
Sippin' on a diet coke (Hey dude)
Tanglin' with the intercrop (Tip top)
Chaperone my scapegoat (Top fish)
Change a tenner for two fivers (Too too)
Fell off the floor, fell off the floor (Man)
Fell off the floor, fell off the floor (Man)
Fell off the floor, fell off the floor (Man)
Rita Hay(worth), Rita Hay(worth), Rita Hay(worth)
Rita Hay
{Don't try this at home}
(Going out to steel a ruby)
(Going out to steel a ruby)
(Going out to steel a ruby)
Looking like a rayon, love to do it indoor
They all got a say on, falling off the damned floor
Succulent but sucked in, always I'll be in for
One thing to be tucked in, falling off the same floor1Embed
