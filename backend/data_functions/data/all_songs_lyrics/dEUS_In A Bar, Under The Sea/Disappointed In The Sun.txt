Disappointed In The Sun LyricsWho could tell the story better
About the things that I went through
Some were great but most were terrifying
And so spooky too
Had to get out of there, to hide away
Had to get out of there, to find my way
I troubled everything too soon
Now where I want to be is...
Where I want to be is...
Need I say my only wish was
To escape my earthly life
High skies were no option whereas
Diving deep in oceans wide
Was the way for me, to hide away
A possibility, to leave today
I troubled everything too soon
Now where I want to be is... where I want to be is...
Where I want to be is...
Under the sea, is where I'll be
No talking 'bout the rain no more
I wonder what thunder will mean, when only in my dream
The lightning comes before the roar
Circumstantial situations, now I know what people meant
Beware of the implications, God I've had enough of them
Decided to be brave and find a way
Just picking out a wave and slide away
I troubled everything too soon
Now where I want to be is...
Where I want to be is...
Maybe taking it another hour then taking away the pain (3 times)
I troubled everything too soon now where I want to be is...
Then taking away the pain
Then taking away the pain
Where I want to be is...
Then taking away the pain
Where I want to be is...
Under the sea, is where I'll be
No talking 'bout the rain no more
I wonder what thunder will mean (thunder), when only in my dream
The lightning comes before the roar
Under the sea, down here with me I find I'm not the only one
Who ponders what life would mean (I wonder) if we hadn't been
So disappointed in the sun
And that's why we're thinking
That's why we're drinking in a bar under the sea
And that's why we're thinking
That's why we're drinking in a bar under the seaEmbed
