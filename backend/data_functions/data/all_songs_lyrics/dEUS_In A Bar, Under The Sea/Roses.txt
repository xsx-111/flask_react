Roses Lyrics
Rose said, quote: “It’s time to make a mess”
Time will be soon mine in time, I guess
She’s painting on my back a beautiful flowerpot
And she treats me, she treats me, she treats me like her local god
Rose said, quote: “It’s time to make a mess”
This one’s yours and yours is self-obsessed
She’s painting on my back a green tom, the beefheart one
And she cuddles and she coos and she cuts the bullshit I confessed

She said: “Don’t look my way, what can I possibly say?
I've never seen you before today
I’m just the one that makes you think of the one
That makes you feel you're the one”

To thank you for the roses, for the roses
So thank you for the roses, for the roses
Thank you for the roses, for the roses
Thank you for the roses, for the roses

Rose said, quote: “It’s time to make a mess”
Remind me what it is that I do best
She’s painting on my back some beautiful something sweet
And she treats me, she treats me, she beats me
Rose said, quote: “My time has come at last”
Ugly things through my mind they have passed
She's scratching on my back: “If this boy believes me”
She leaves me, deceives me and takes those flowers just to please me

Rosie don't mind where she been
She been blind, she been mine all this time
She been kind, she been mine
She said: “Thank you for the roses, for the roses”
Thank you for the roses, for the roses
Thank you for the roses, for the roses
Thank you for the roses, for the roses
Thank you for the roses, for the roses
Thank you for the roses, for the roses
Thank youEmbed
