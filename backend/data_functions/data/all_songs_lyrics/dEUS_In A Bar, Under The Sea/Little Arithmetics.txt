Little Arithmetics LyricsInto temptation, over in doubt
Black night, neonlight into my house
Talking, talking, talking about
Out of frustration over in doubt
Hold me now, I'm hoping that you can explain
Little arithmetics
Got me down, they're fooling me again and again
Little arithmetics, little arithmetics
Got me down
Sometimes I feel like going down south (Sometimes I'm feeling alright)
Sometimes I feel like I'm over and out (Sometimes I'm losing my mind)
Talking, talking, talking about (Sometimes the day is the night)
Into temptation over in doubt (Sometimes I don't wanna fight)
Hold me now, (Hold me now)
I'm hoping that you can explain
Little arithmetics
Got me down, (Hold me now)
They're fooling me again and again
Little arithmetics, little arithmetics
Hold me now
Little arithmetics
Got me downEmbed
