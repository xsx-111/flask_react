Serpentine LyricsI'm caught in the flow of things
My memory's broken machine
This is how my day begins
This is just one day unseen
Let's do it serpentine, any time
Let's do it right here
Let's do it serpentine, I don't mind
Let's do it right here
Is it bad that you're good for me
Did I love you just randomly?
I'm caught in the flow of sound
And you're just some melody
Let's do it serpentine, any time
Let's do it right here
Let's do it serpentine, I don't mind
Let's do it right here
There's a cute little litany
Put it on my shoulder
Eight o'clock and we agree
It makes me look much older
Got my clockworks company
Got my dark green trenchcoat on
I'm sure it will always be
Someone staying and someone gone
Let's do it serpentine, any time
Let's do it right here
Let's do it serpentine, I don't mind
Let's do it right hereEmbed
