Gimme The Heat LyricsSomeone could say: "I don't belong here"
No one could say: "Isn't it all clear?"
I'm blowing a phrase out in the open
Out on the street, just gimme the heat
I'll suck the flame to me
I'll suck it in, I'm O. K. I should be
You cut me deep, you know how to do it
My motives are cheap, you know how I do it
So when do we go, where do we meet
I'll give you my sorrow, you'll give me the heat
I'll suck the flame to me
I'll suck it in
Some erotic feel
Keeps coming on
It's so unreal
I come undone
Then I look back (I find a frame already built)
When I look back (it's still waiting to be filled)
I find it had
Flickered for a minute and then it was gone
Someone could say: "I don't belong here"
Every night, every day, just gimme the heat
Some erotic feel
Keeps coming on
It's so unreal
I come undone
Some shady deal
Despite the black
The light gets in
Through every crack
Then I look back (I find a frame already built)
When I look back (it's still waiting to be filled)
Why is it that (time between and no time left)
Why is it not (sweeter than I ever thought)
How can it last (make it last a minute more)
How can it last (make it last a little more)
How can it last (make it last a little more)
How can it last (make it last a minute more)
I been around the bend
I can't remember when
But my great misery
It means a lot to me
You been around, I know
And me I'm just to slow
I'm craving more and more
I'm craving more and more
I'm craving more and more
Gimme, gimme the heatEmbed
