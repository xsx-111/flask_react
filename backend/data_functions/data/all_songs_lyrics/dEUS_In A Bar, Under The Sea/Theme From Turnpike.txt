Theme From Turnpike LyricsHe went to the bottom, put his soul on fire
He went to the bottom, put his soul on fire
New Jersey Turnpike riding on a wet night
New Jersey Turnpike riding on a wet night
Maybe he got the rhyme
Maybe he got the eyes
Maybe he got the time counterclock wise
He said...., he said....
New Jersey Turnpike riding on a wet night
New Jersey Turnpike riding on a wet night
Maybe he got the song
Maybe he got the size
Maybe he got it wrong counterclock wise
He said: "No more loud music"
He said: "No more loud music"
He said: "No more loud music"
He said: "No more loud music"Embed
