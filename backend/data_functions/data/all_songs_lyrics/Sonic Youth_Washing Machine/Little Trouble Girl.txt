Little Trouble Girl Lyrics
Ready? Go, 1, 2, 3, 4

If you want me to
I will be the one
That is always good
And you'll love me too
But you'll never know
What I feel inside
That I'm really bad
Little trouble girl

Remember mother?
We were close
Very, very close
(Sha la la) You taught me how to fit it good
(Sha la la) Flow down life you understood
(Sha la la) Curl my hair and eye lash
(Sha la la) Hitch my cheeks and do my lips
(Sha la la) Swing my hips, just like you
(Sha la la) Smile and behave
(Sha la la) A circle of perfection, it's what you gave
(Sha la la) Then one day, I met a guy
He stole my heart, no alibi
(Sha la la) He said: "Romance is a ticket to paradise"
(Sha la la) Momma, I'm not too young to try
(Sha la la) We kissed, we hugged
We were close
Very, very close
(Sha la la) We danced in the sand
And the water rose - higher and higher
(Sha la la) Until I found myself floating - in the sky
I'm sorry mother, I'd rather fight
Than have to lie
If you want me to
I will be the one
That is always good
And you'll love me too
But you'll never know
What I feel inside
That I'm really bad
Little trouble girl

Little trouble girl (What you doing?)
Little trouble girl (Cross my heart and hope to die)
Little trouble girl (I can not tell a lie)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)Embed
