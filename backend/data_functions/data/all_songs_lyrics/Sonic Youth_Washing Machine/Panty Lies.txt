Panty Lies Lyrics
Don't just stare, 'cause she's not wearing underwear
Em-em-em-em-em-em-em-em
Oh how rude, at least she's got your attention square
Em-em-em-em-em-em-em-em
Don't you realize, it's just her disguise
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
Hey, mom look, no more panty line
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
Shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

Peek-a-boo look into the mirror
Now you see her, now you'll be her
Hover your lips, twirl your hair
Pretend you're there, pretend it ain't there
Little girl playing in the closet
First comes walking, then comes talking
Peek-a-boo look into the mirror
She says: "who am I?"
Inside! outside!
Inside, outside, inside, outside, inside, outside
Inside, outside, inside, outside

Shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa
Hm-a-hm-a-hm-a-hm-a (Shoewa, shoewa, shoewa, shoewa)
Shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa
Hm-a-hm-a-hm-a-hm-a (Shoewa, shoewa, shoewa, shoewa)
Da-da-da-da-da (Shoewa, shoewa, shoewa, shoewa)
Don't just stare, 'cause she's not wearing underwear
Em-em-em-em-em-em-em-em
Oh how rude, at least she's got your attention square
Em-em-em-em-em-em-em-em
Don't you realize, it's just her disguise
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
Hey, mom look, no more panty line
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
I-a-oh-a-I-a-a-oh-a-I-a-uh-a-I-a-I-I-uh-aEmbed
