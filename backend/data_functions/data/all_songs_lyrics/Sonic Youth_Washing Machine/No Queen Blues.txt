No Queen Blues Lyrics
Hey, hey! Where you are going in such a hurry?
Take it easy girl and tell me a story
Move on over here, slow it down
Tell me why you've been, run out of town

I don't give a fuck, why everybody thinks you should shut up
Everybody's freaked, cause everybody knows that you are the queen of
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

Hey, hey! Where you are going in such a rush
Hey girl I think they think you know too much
They can't catch you with me cause I move too slow
Slow enough to know that you gonna have to go

I don't really care why the bullshit artists sit and snap
They can never find about me and the queen of
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!


I don't really care why the bullshit artists sit and snap
They can never find about me and the queen of
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!Embed
