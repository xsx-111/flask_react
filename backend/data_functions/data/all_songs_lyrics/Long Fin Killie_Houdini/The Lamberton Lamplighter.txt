The Lamberton Lamplighter LyricsI haven't really got much time for girls
Don't get me wrong now
Don't get me wrong now
It's just my nights are occupied with lighting
These damn lamps
There you go
Oh, and night's a time for courting for girls
Night's a time for courting for girls
Isn't it?
I have been propositioned by girls before
On me lamp rounds
Oh yes, I have
But I'm at pains to explain it's not my line of trade
Buying flowers and chocolate mice
It's just the thought of commitment's totally wild
Any sort of commitment's out of order
Isn't it?
I've had some girls come up to me
Who said it won't take that long
Just a quick one up the back
One for the lads
And I'm at pains to explain I'm not that type of guy
And send the slack-jawed bitches on their way
I seem to have a lot more time for guys
Don't get me wrong now
Don't get me wrong now
It's just their wit and charm and conversation
Captures youth and that's the truth
Oh and youth's the time when cares traipse free...
I've had some girls come up to me
Who said it won't take that long
Just a quick one up the back
One for the lads
And I'm at pains to explain I'm not that type of guy
And send the slack-jawed bitches on their wayEmbed
