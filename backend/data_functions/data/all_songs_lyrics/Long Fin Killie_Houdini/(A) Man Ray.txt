(A) Man Ray LyricsHe said, "I'm just a little fascinated by the female form
But sadly you're as near as I'll ever get
And if I fail to catch that wounded goddess in you
Well I've a flair for porno"
He said, "Just let me take your picture"
And I said "Ok, but my stomach's not where it ought to be
It's not like you could eat ice cream off it"
And he said "It's ok, just keep your shirt on"
And his eyes glazed over, so insistent
Effortless charm and a tasteless hairline
This velvet crush of a man, crouched over a camera stand
And a flair for porno
He said, "You're a dazzling floral display"
He said, "You're a dazzling floral display"Embed
