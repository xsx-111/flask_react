Bulletproof, oversized, rocket-powered pornophile
Bulletproof, oversized, rocket-powered pornophile
As harmless as a dog in the rain
I'm as harmless as a dog in the rain
Bulletproof, oversized, rocket-powered pornophile
Bulletproof, oversized, rocket-powered pornophile
As hard as nails, sweet pea
As hard as nails
As hard as nails, sweet pea
And he means every word
"Turn off that faggot disco shit"
And he means every word
"Turn off that nіgger  music"
And he means every word
"This won't take 5 minutes"
Bulletproof, oversized, rocket-powered pornophile
Bulletproof, oversized, rocket-powered pornophile
Bulletproof, oversized, rocket-powered pornophile
Bulletproof, oversized, rocket-powered pornophile

You'll never guess what
Bottle green eyes
A blood-red car
And cornfields
And that's not all
Effortless charm
He hates false metal
A pisces
All of these gems
In the same place
All of them mine?
Not quite
Cause I'm allergic to his lipstick
I'm allergic to the lipsticked mouth
I'm allergic to the lipstick
I'm allergic to his lipsticked mouthEmbed
