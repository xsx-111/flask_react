How I Blew It With Houdini LyricsHoudini popped up out of the blue
She caught me on a saturday
She said, "I'm looking for a sensitive intelligent man
But all those guys have boyfriends
So you'll have to do for now"
With her hearing aid and walking stick
She looked as if she'd passed her best
But she held my arm and said to me
"I'm so glad that I've found you
You're mine again"
Full of the joys of a home win
I thought I'd humour an old queen
She said, "I'll take you to the cinema
And show you where it's at boy"
I tried to back down courteously
"Tonights the night for clubbing, dear"
But she pulled her arm away from me
And screamed "You hopeless E-fused disco sheep!"
"I'm looking for a sensitive intelligent man
But all those guys have boyfriends
And you won't do
No, you won't do"
And that's how I blew it with Houdini
And that's how I blew it with Houdini
And that's how I blew it with Houdini
And that's how I blew it with Houdini
And that's how I blew it with Houdini
And that's how I blew it with HoudiniEmbed
