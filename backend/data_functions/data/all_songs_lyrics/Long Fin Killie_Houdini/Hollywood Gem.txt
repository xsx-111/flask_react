Hollywood Gem LyricsThink about it, this picture
"How I'd love to throttle you"
A song and dance for the same old bit part
Total strangers ask me for a fight
Tired of your roles
It's only half the picture
Censored like a funky mother
Trying to break a language barrier
With men that speak like I do
Another golden prospect floats by
Think about it, this picture
How they'd love to lynch you
Another tom with a chip on his shoulder
"This n—ñgger's gone way too far"
Hollywood ruins another gem
Another myth in melanin
Think about it, this picture
Wait till they get their hands on you
A livid prick, dissing bitches
Gun-toting, jewelerized, foul-mouthed
Tired of your roles
It's only half the picture
Censored like a funky mother
Trying to break a language barrier
With men that speak like I do
Another golden prospect floats by
Hollywood breaks another gemEmbed
