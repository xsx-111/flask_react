Corngold LyricsYou'll never guess what
Bottle green eyes
A blood-red car
And cornfields
And that's not all
Effortless charm
He hates false metal
A pisces
All of these gems
In the same place
All of them mine?
Not quite
Cause I'm allergic to his lipstick
I'm allergic to the lipsticked mouth
I'm allergic to the lipstick
I'm allergic to his lipsticked mouthEmbed
