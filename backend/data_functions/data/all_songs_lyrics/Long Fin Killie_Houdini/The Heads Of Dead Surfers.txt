The Heads Of Dead Surfers LyricsA mid-life Adonis
A god-like forty year-old
Clear skin, clear head
Clear smile, dead style
Designer beach clothes
A little bit of a paunch
This beach-boy Achilles
A former leading light of radio
Drowned in suntan lotion
Makes a bold declaration
We drove the Moors back into the sea and now we ride their waves
And he muttered something about the positive vibes of the sea
I feel at one with the waves
He said, let's get a Big Mac, tune into happening sounds, check out the chicks on the beach and chill out
Chill out
Chill out
"We all crawled out of the sea"--and then he winked--"didn't we?"
We drove the Moors back into the sea and now we ride their waves

Bountiful in the cities...
I am the fire in your lungs
I am the fire in your dead lungs
I am the fire in the airwaves

A & R man's dream!Embed
