Idiot Hormone LyricsYou're losing your charm like an old hairdo
You pucker like a swine
There's no way I'll kiss you
All of this time you're the limp side of nothing
The working man's jukebox, allergic to lipstick
Bore, you looked at me
Thought you'd like the mystery
I'm a whore, you caught my eye
Didn't even have to try
Don't call me nіgger, you big R&B fan
Bigger than England, swimming in shell suits
You smell like a game show, I just can't explain it
A club 18 snapshot of the video nation
Bore, you looked at me
Thought you'd like the mystery
I'm a whore, you caught my eye
Didn't even have to try
Despond the heavy trauma of a prehistoric love life
Make a video, become a thirty-second star
Sing a song for sixpence and don't forget your toothbrush
Keep your head up lightly and perhaps you'll win the car
Bore, you looked at me
Thought you'd like the mystery
I'm a whore, you caught my eye
Didn't even have to try
You're losing your charm like an old hairdo
You pucker like a swine
There's no way I'll kiss you
All of this time you're the limp side of nothing
The working man's jukebox, allergic to lipstickEmbed
