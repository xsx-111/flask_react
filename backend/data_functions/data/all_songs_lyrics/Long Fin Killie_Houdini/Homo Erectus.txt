Homo Erectus LyricsSo you've learned to walk on your hind legs at last
A prodigious gift at any stretch
Vaseline smells like a godsend slipping club feet into Nikes
Blue face lather skulking back behind a bouquet
All that I said
Is you're a curable head-case
The way you make do
In such a hell of a bad way
Handbrake turns is such a loser's game
You'd be better off with something else
Splitting the heads of the way sides
Round raiding laundrettes  on joy rides
Cut your hair and use a little imagination
All that I said
Is you're a curable head-case
The way you make do
In such a hell of a bad way
All that I said
Is you're a curable head-case
The way you make do
In such a hell of a bad wayEmbed
