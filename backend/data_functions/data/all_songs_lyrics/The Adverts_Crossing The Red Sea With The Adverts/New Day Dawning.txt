New Day Dawning LyricsWe say don't show your guns, if you don't intend to fight
We say don't sleep all day, if you can't keep awake at night
Don't screw it up. Don't be a hero
'Cause we don't need them
Be a panther or a poet
Someone to light the beacon
And I wonder, is a new day dawning?
And I wonder, is it around the corner?
I wonder, are the fighting men still fighting men?
Do they go on and on and on?
Prepare to lose
Prepare to harden to distress
This ain't your system
You're just second-generation business
So don't screw it up. Don't be a hero
'Cause we don't need them
No political immunity
To save your position
And I wonder, is a new day dawning?
And I wonder, is it around the corner?
I wonder, are the fighting men still fighting men?
Do they go on and on and on?
You can't relax, just 'cause you're socially secure
If you've forgot what you're fighting for
We could effect a cause
So don't screw it up. Don't be a hero
'Cause we don't need them
Frustration is a speed of the people and they let it lead themEmbed
