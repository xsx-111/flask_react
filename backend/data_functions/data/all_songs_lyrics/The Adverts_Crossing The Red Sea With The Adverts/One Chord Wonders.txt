One Chord Wonders LyricsI wonder what we'll play for you tonight
Something heavy or something light
Something to set your soul alight
I wonder how we'll answer when you say
"We don't like you, go away
Come back when you've learned to play"
I wonder what we'll do when things go wrong
When we're half-way through our favorite song
We look up and the audience has gone
Will we feel a little bit obscure
Think we're not needed here
We must be new wave, they'll like us next year
(The wonders don't care) We don't give a damn
(The wonders don't care) We don't give a damn
(The wonders don't care) We don't give a damnEmbed
