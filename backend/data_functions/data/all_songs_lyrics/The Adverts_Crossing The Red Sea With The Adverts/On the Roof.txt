On the Roof LyricsBlank-faced
Was this what our elders taught?
Dim the lights and live like storybook
I can't focus for the pinball
I'm all shook up and I think I see it all
But I know that it ain't that simple
I got loose
Up on the roof
Waiting for you
Two-faced
Was this what our elders taught?
We're human too
Indulge in small talk
I take a walk down the alley
Some drunk half-kills me
We're fighting on the floor for a ha'penny
I got loose
Up on the roof
Waiting for you
Well, I guess I'm waiting for the punchline
I'm a refugee with a rare find
I've got a place where I can unwind
I got loose
Up on the roof
Waiting for you
We'll hideEmbed
