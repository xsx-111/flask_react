Bored Teenagers LyricsWe're talking into corners finding ways to fill the vacuum
And though our mouths are dry we talk in hope to hit on something new
Tied to the railway tracks, it's one way to revive but no way to relax
We're just bored teenagers
Looking for love or should I say emotional rages
Bored teenagers
Seeing ourselves as strangers
We talk about the whys and wherefore, do we really care at all?
Talk about the frailty of words is rarely meaningful
When we're sitting watching the 'planes burn up through the night like meteorites
We're just bored teenagers
Looking for love or should I say emotional rages
Bored teenagers
Seeing ourselves as strangers
Bored teenagers
Bored teenagers, oh yeahEmbed
