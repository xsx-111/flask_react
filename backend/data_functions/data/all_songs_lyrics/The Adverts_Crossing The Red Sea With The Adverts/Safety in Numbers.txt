Safety in Numbers LyricsWhat are you going to do with your new ways?
What are you going to do with your new wave?
Maybe it's that you no longer care
Now you're so great
You've just got to stand there
Or were you never even bothered anyway
About the new wave
What about the new wave?
Did you think it would change things?
Here we all are in the latest craze
Stick with the crowd
Hope it's not a passing phase
It's the latest thing to be nowhere
You can turn into the wallpaper
But you know you were always there anyway
Without the new wave
What about the new wave?
Did you think it would change things?
It's just safety in numbers
When it's tricky, when it gets tough
When you need to feel that you're good enough
All you pretty people who've been taken over
Had better start looking for your own answers
'Cause there's no safety in numbers anyway
Or in a new wave
What about the new wave?
Did you think it would change things?
It's just safety in numbersEmbed
