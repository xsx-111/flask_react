New Church LyricsMaybe - maybe a fool for trusting
Maybe - maybe a fool for following
The god of wisdom, not of love
But I'm riding with the new church
I'm riding with the new church
Relying on the new church
And a new word
Hang on - if you hang on to faith and meekness
Before long, it's power for the strong
It's twisted into something evil
Something wrong
So, I'm riding with the new church
I'm riding with the new church
Relying on the new church
And a new word
So long - goodbye to the blind and the weaklings
Be strong - I'll do what I want
I'll follow my feelings
I'll go where they lead me
Strength within you, not without you
The new church needs youEmbed
