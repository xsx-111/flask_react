New Boys LyricsWe're out on a limb
Should we let the newboys in?
We think they can't do no harm
Let's humour them
But they need some passion inside
They take it like a cigarette
They feel it when it breaks their minds
In their lungs and in their chests
No regrets
They didn't tell me
They'd been there for so many years
I don't know what to do
I think I love you, you love me too?
Is it really true
You can't want me
You can't need me
You can't love me, see
You can't want me
You can't need me
You can't have me, see
Well, I feel like I'm at sea
The plank's beneath my feet
Inevitably we two must meet again
But they're going to extremes
They're feeling quite at ease
They fight with brain instead of power
And no-one wins
There's no answers
Now newboys quarrel
They're bitching, they tangle
A tendency to intellectualise
They won't let things be
Your conversation locks my door
Then throws away the key
You can't help meEmbed
