On Wheels LyricsWhat's left in the wheelchair?
Who bothers what's in there?
Who worries what life's like on wheels?
No body to speak of
No willpower, voice, love
Who intends to steer us?
On wheels
I'm some new kind of great explorer
I sink the lowest, I go further
I'm sailing on the 'Lucky Dragon'
I'm ready for whatever happens
Living out the life unstable
Men like animals, untameable
On wheels
What's left in the wheelchair?
A taste of life and death together
I wish this embrace could last foreverEmbed
