Swallows LyricsAre you a threat to the west
Sticking out your chest
Are you a threat to the west
Protecting your nest
Are a threat to the west
Sticking out your chest
Is protecting your nest
A threat to the west
Feathers that grew from your wings
These things you were born into
Whether you choked on that food
Or spat some sugar in my bowl
Swallow swallow
Someone would be swallowed whole
Are you a threat to the west
Sticking out your chest
Are you a threat to the west
Protecting your nest
So sing a song for me
A swallow sitting on a tree
No words doesn't mean
No harmony
It's coming to hear you breathe
Are you a threat to the west
Sticking out your chest
Are you a threat to the west
Protecting your nestEmbed
