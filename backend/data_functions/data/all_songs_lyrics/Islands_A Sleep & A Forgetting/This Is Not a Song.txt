This Is Not a Song LyricsIf Penny roams away, I will have lost everything
In many subtle ways, I already don't have anything
I hate to watch you go, oh
Nick, if you ever learn, it never shows
And this is not a song
So why do I find it so hard to move on?
Feels a crime to be crying for this long
In upper atmosphere, my head comes loose
And in the freefall, I can feel the blues
I hate to watch you go, oh
Nick, if you ever learn, it never shows
If this is just a song
Then why do I find it so hard to move on?
Feels a crime to be crying for this longEmbed
