Same Thing LyricsTurned on the radio
So many songs
This one is good but what else is on
Same thing
Same thing
Same thing
Same thing
I loved a girl
And I will never love again
There's no one in this world
I could ever love again
Same thing
Same thing
Same thing
Same thing
I can't wait to see
What becomes of me
The ease with which I sleep
Tends to frighten meEmbed
