Oh Maria LyricsOh Maria
Oh Maria
Oh Maria's in the pasture
With all the people running past her
She said "if every day's a holy day"
She said "if every day's a holy day"
She said "if every day's a holy day
Then today must be the day of the dead"
Oh Maria
Oh Maria
Now that you're all alone
Do you remember that song?
She woke up
Singing along
The words came quickly
But the melody was wrong
Oh Maria is in the pasture
With all the people running past her
She said "if every day's a holy day"
She said "if every day's a holy day"
She said "if every day's a holy day
Then today must be the day of the dead"
Oh Maria
Oh Maria
Now that you're all alone
Do you remember that song?
Just think of me when you're falling asleep
When you wake up, you'll be able to dreamEmbed
