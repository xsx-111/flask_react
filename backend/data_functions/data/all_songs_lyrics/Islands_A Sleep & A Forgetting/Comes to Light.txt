Comes to Light LyricsSomething heard along the way
And it don't sound right
Thought I heard you say
"Waiting for the night"
Think I knew it all along
Cause it never felt right
Then I hear it in a song
And it comes to light
And it feels wrong
And it don't seem right
Feels like
It'll never come to light
But our love
Is so much stronger
Won't be much longer
'fore it ever comes to light
Well I know, I know, I know
I've been told and told and told
If I go, I go of
My own volition
And I know, I know, I know
Like I've known all along
I know I know what
I have been missing
When you found me snapped in two
Like you often do
You brought me out
You made me come around
No matter what they say
No matter what you do
Never gonna stop
Ever loving you
Even if it feels wrong
And it don't seem right
And it feels like
It'll never come to light
But our love
Is so much stronger
Won't be much longer
'fore it ever comes to lightEmbed
