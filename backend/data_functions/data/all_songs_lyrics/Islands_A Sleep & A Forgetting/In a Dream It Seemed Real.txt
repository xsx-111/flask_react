In a Dream It Seemed Real LyricsOpen up your door for me
And let me in
Oh can't you see
How cold I am?
You remain there
Unabated
And you refuse to let me lose you
Only when I sleep I do
And the sounds forming words
From the wellspring of concern
While my boat in that ocean turned
On the hull I watched the city burn
In a dream
In a dream
In a dream
It seemed real
Even in the dream I cried
I'm a giveaway
I could never hide
All the sadness inside
Blue
What a funny colour to colour you
Love is hard to hold onto
Only when I sleep I do
And the sounds forming words
From the wellspring of concern
While my boat in that ocean turned
On the hull I watched the city burn
In a dream
In a dream
In a dream
It seemed realEmbed
