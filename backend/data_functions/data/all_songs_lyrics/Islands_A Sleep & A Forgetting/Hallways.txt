Hallways LyricsWaiting to get to your room
Hallways
Always waiting, feels like I've been waiting for days
In these hallways
Wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait
Walls cave
Turns refuse to waste
Hallways
Knock, knock, knock, broken lock
I'll just wait in the
Hallway
In some small way, oooh
This can be a pleasurable phase
Walls cave
Turns refuse to waste
Hallways
Walls cave
Turns refuse to waste
Hallways
In the hallways, girl
She turns to you to say
"Always"Embed
