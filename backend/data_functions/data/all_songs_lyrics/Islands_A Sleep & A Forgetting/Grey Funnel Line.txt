Grey Funnel Line LyricsDon't mind the rain, nor the rolling sea
The weary night never worries me
But the hardest time in a sailors day
Is to watch the sun as it dies away
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line
The finest ship that sails the sea
Is still a prison for the likes of me
But give me wings like Noah's dove
I'll fly up harbor to the girl I love
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line
Oh Lord if dreams were only real
I'd have my hands on that wooden wheel
And with all my heart I'd turn her 'round
And tell the boy's that we're homeward bound
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line
I'll pass the time like some machine
Until blue water turns to green
Then I'll dance on down that walk ashore
And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more
And sail the Grey Funnel Line no moreEmbed
