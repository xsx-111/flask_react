Cold Again LyricsWandering
Through the cold again
It's been cold outside
And it's getting cold again
Wondering
Won't you let me in?
It's been cold outside
And it's getting cold again
Someone is sleeping
Drowning out all that screaming
Of someone's loved ones right outside
Someone is sleeping
Drowning out all that screaming
Of someone's loved ones right outside
Wandering
Through the cold again
It's been cold outside
And it's getting cold again
Someone is sleeping
Drowning out all that screaming
Of someone's loved ones right outside
Wandering
Through the cold again
It's been cold outside
And it's getting cold again
Wondering
Why won't you let me in?
It's been cold outside
And it's getting cold againEmbed
