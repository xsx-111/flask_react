No Crying LyricsI walked right in, I sat right down
Listening to the saddest song
If I don't feel bad, is there something wrong?
I sympathized, I synthesized
A teardrop from my tired eyes
But I don't feel sad and I cannot cry
And I won't cry for you
I'm not able to
She said I don't mind, instead think of why
The chorus wept, the bridge caved in
The verses stung your perfect skin
But I don't feel like it's touched my soul
So I climbed right in, listening
I got so close you'd think I'd been
Bonded by a teary eye
And I won't cry for you
I'm not able to
She said I don't mind, instead think of why
Then I heard your voice
Sang just one note
The sweetest sound, came from your throat
And I think I'll cry just a little whileEmbed
