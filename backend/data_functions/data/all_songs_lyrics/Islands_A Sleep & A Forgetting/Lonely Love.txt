Lonely Love LyricsI heard you cry, cry
To a lonesome lullaby, lullaby
And the only love
Is a lonely love
And now you know why
While aglow
In dulcet tones
You heard a low
Troubled note
And though you found yourself unsettled
By the disquieting sound
It didn't get you down, it didn't get you down
Home, where you wanna be alone
With your lonely little love
And my how you have grown
Have you come into your own
Lalala lonely little hands
Of a lonely little man
Lalala lonely little hands
Of a lonely little man
The unkindness of
Raven love
Soon becomes
A hole in your heart
Where feeling should be but where everything's been torn apart
La la lala lala lonely love
Lonely little love
Lalala lonely little love
Lonely little love
Lalalalala lonely love
Lonely little love
Lalala lonely little love
I don't want no part of this lonely love
I don't want no part of this love
I don't want no part of this lonely love
I don't want no part of this loveEmbed
