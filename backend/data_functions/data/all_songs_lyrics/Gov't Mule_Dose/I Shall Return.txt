I Shall Return LyricsAs this wheel goes 'round and I search to find my way
Struggle just to hold on through an ordinary day
I do believe I'm slipping away
But I shall return though I'm losing myself
I shall return
I shall return from the depths of my own hell
I shall return
Fate should not have blinded me
For your beauty steals my eyes
And what good is my wisdom
When there are no words to say
How I feel everyday
But I shall return though I'm losing myself
I shall return
I shall return from the depths of my own hell
I shall return
Daylight finds me sleeping dreaming of my youth
But darkness calls my name out loud
And I answer to the truth
But I shall return though I'm losing myself
I shall return
I shall return from the depths of my own
I shall return
Oh, I shall return though I'm losing myself
I shall return
I shall return from the depths of my own hell
I shall returnEmbed
