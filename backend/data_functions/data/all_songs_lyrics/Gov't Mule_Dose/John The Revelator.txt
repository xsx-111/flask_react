You know Christ (Christ) had twelve apostles (spirit willing)
Three he layed away (O but the flesh was weak)
He said watch me while I walk (Ooh)
While I go out and pray
Listen
Well Christ rose on Easter morning (Hallelujah)
Mary mother came down to see (the resurrection)
He said Go and tell my disciples (Ooh)
To meet me in Galilee

(The revelation of Jesus) An officer of the law
(The revelation of Jesus) But then I had a revelation
(The revelation of Jesus) Because of what I saw
(The revelation of Jesus) The air was always so gloomy
(The revelation of Jesus) Every day was dull and grey
(The revelation of Jesus) But now I see very clearly
(The revelation of Jesus) O, o, o, o happy day
(The revelation of Jesus) Jesus
(Jesus) Jesus
(Jesus) Jesus
(Jesus) Jesus
(Jesus) Jesus
