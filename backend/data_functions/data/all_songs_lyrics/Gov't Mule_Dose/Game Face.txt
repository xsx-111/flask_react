Game Face LyricsSail on savior
I can't take no more of your insanity wisdom
Satisfy your angels
With your cocaine and your guns
As for me I don't need them
When my shadow comes alive
And wrestles with my soul
Oh, do you really want to know
Savior, you can be what you want to be
Oh yeah, and only see what you want to see
Sail on, can't let you get next to me
To be at one with your weakness
Is your greatest strength
Guess you should be proud of your game face
Guess it always was your hallelujah
Guess it was your saving grace
Savior, you can be what you want to be
Oh yeah, and only see what you want to see
Sail on, can't let you get next to me
You can say what you want now
My eyes are open wide
How was I ever on your side
Savior, you can be what you want to be
Oh yeah, and only see what you want to see
Sail on, can't let you get next to meEmbed
