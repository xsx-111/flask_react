Thorazine Shuffle LyricsStand by to stand by
Ain't no need to worry today
Thorazine shuffle make everything OK
I know how you feel
You say you need your highs and lows
But what if you could take your pain
And just let it go
Step right back and watch me now
I'll show you how it's done
Stay right here with me now
Till the damage is done
And the damage is done
Time drags by
When you're boring
Don't care what you do care what you say
There comes a time
When you got to let the monster inside you
Let him come on out, come on out and play
Step right back and watch me now
I'll show you how it's done
Stay right here with me now
Till the damage is done
Step right back and watch me now
Oh yeah till you change your mind
Stay right here with me now
Till the damage is done
And the damage is done
Stand by to stand by
Ain't no need to worry today
Thorazine shuffle make everything OKEmbed
