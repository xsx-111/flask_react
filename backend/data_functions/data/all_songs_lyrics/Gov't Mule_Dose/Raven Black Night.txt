Raven Black Night LyricsRaven black night
Let me walk with you upon the wind
Dream-escape to another world where we belong
Sleep-awake make up your mind
Help me find a stranger, a stranger with the answer
Who'll enlighten me and just disappear
Into the raven black night
Raven black night
Stars no longer even try to shine
Penetrate the darkness for a moment
But what's the use
Death dance make up your mind
Do I fear the spirits
And hide from the angels
Do I try to find the light
Or do I just follow you
Into the raven black night
Raven black night
Let me walk with you upon the wind
Dream-escape to another world where we belong
We belong
We belongEmbed
