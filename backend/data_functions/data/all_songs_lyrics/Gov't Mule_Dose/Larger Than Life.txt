Larger Than Life LyricsIf I concentrate will it just come to me
Run it by me I'm willing to learn
Make no mistake you'll never be allowed to come inside
Just be glad you're here on the outside looking in
Cause it won't take long to get to the bottom
Won't take much to be looking down at yourself
You think you know something but you don't know nothing
Everybody knows that death is larger than life
Captivate yourself you're the only one that can help you now
With your cartoon savior by your side
Look around the room do you see anyone that you recognize
Cause it won't take long to get to the bottom
Won't take much to be looking down at yourself
You think you know something but you don't know nothing
Everybody knows that death is larger than life
Cause it won't take long to get to the bottom
Won't take much to be looking down at yourself
You think you know something but you don't know nothing
Everybody knows that death is larger than lifeEmbed
