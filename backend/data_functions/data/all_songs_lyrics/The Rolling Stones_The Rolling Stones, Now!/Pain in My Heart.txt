Pain in My Heart Lyrics
Pain in my heart, treating me poor
Where can my baby be? Lord, no one knows
Pain in my heart won't let me sleep
Where can my baby be, Lord, where is she?

And one day my days are getting tough
Won't you come back, come back, come back, baby
Lord

Pain in my heart won't let me be
Oh, I wake up restless night in misery, Lord
Won't somebody stop this pain

Lord, one day my days are getting tough
Won't you love me, love me, love me, baby

Pain in my heart
Pain in my heart
Somebody stop this
Pain in my heart
It's killing me baby
This pain in my heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Pain in my heart
This pain in my heartEmbed
