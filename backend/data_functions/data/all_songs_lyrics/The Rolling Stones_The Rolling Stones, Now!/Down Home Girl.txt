Down Home Girl Lyrics
Lord I swear the perfume you wear
Was made out of turnip greens
And every time I kiss you girl
It tastes like pork and beans
Even though you're wearing them
Citified high heels
I can tell by your giant step
You been walking through the cotton fields
Oh, you're so down home girl

Every time you monkey child
You take my breath away
And every time you move like that
I've got to get down and pray
Don't you know that dress of yours
Was made out of fiberglass?
And every time you move like that
I got to go to Sunday mass
Oh, you're so down home girl


Oh, you're so down home girl
I'm going to take you to the muddy river
And push you in
Just to watch the water roll on
Down your velvet skin
I am going to take you back to New Orleans
Down in Dixieland
I am going to watch you do the second line
With an umbrella in your hand
Oh, you are so down home girl

I am with you baby
You are so down home
Ow! Yeah, too much
Out off sight
You are so down home girlEmbed
