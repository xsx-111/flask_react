Everybody Needs Somebody (Short Version) Lyrics
I'm so glad to be here tonight, I'm so glad to be home
And I've got a message for every woman and every man tonight
That ever needed somebody to love
Someone to love them really bad
Someone to please them all the time
Someone to push them when they're down
Someone to talk to when they're up
If you had somebody all the timе
You'd be really happy
You know, sometimеs you gets what you want
But you lose what you have
Now everybody here listen to my song tonight
It save the whole world
And then you go and lose what you have

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to kiss
Some time to miss, now
Someone to tease
Someone to please
And I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
Oh, sometimes I feel
Feel a little sad inside
My baby mistreats me
And I kind of get a little little mad

I need you you you
I need you you you
I love you
Aw, say yes
Let me hear you say yes
Yeah, let me hear you say ah yeah
I need you
Let's talk about it
Let me hear you say yes
About your love
Somebody to feel (I need you, you, you)
Somebody to kiss (I need you, you, you)
Somebody to tease (I need you, you, you)
I need you (I need you, you, you)
I need you
Somebody to love, yes
Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Ah yeah somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to hold (Someone to hold)
Ah yes (I need you)
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, youEmbed
