Surprise, Surprise Lyrics
Heard from friends of mine
You been telling lies
How I was wrapped up in you
But surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
I never wanted you that bad

Because I knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes

Why did you have to
Go and fool after
We had got along so fine?
But surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
There is nothing strange to me

Knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes

Knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes

I hope you are proud of
All your chasing 'round
Thinking I was alone all night
But surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
You're only fooling yourself

Because I knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes

Yeah, baby why did you have to go fool around
After we got along so fine?
I knew you was telling lies and telling jive
Yes, I did
We got along so fine
But I knew you was telling lies
Knew you was talking jive
I could see it in your eyesEmbed
