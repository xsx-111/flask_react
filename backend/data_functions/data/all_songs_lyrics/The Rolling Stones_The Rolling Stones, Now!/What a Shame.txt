What a Shame Lyrics

What a shame, nothing seems to be going right
What a shame, nothing seems to be going right
It seems easy to me that everything can be alright

What a shame, they always want to start a fight
What a shame, they always want to start a fight
Well it scares me so I could sleep in the shelter all night
Well alright


What a shame, you all heard what I said
What a shame, y'all heard what I said
You might wake up in the morning and find your poor self deadEmbed
