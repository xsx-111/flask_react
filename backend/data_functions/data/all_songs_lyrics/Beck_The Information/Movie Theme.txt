Movie Theme Lyrics
Looking for a ladder
In the stratosphere
So i can be happy
Let my bones melt away
Stranded on a plane
That was circling round
I carry my heart
Like a soldier with a hand grenade
Walking down the aisle
Of the supermarket
Looking for the things for
To carry my senses away
Listen to a voice
On the telephone
Somebody's calling
Somebody on the way
Looking for a home
In the magazine page
Wages in my pocket
Gonna buy me anything i need
Searching for bait
Battery light
Wash me away
Gaping at the oceans below
I'm not scared
'Cause there's nobody there
Mind is awake
Anything could lead me astray
Listen to the voice
On the radio wave
Somebody needs you
Somebody who is
On their wayEmbed
