Dark Star Lyrics
One, two 

A disappointment condition, a perfunctory prescription
Of an indigent mindset of belligerent silence
We got all we need droning out of a tin can
Thinking about the rain under the sweatshirt hood
Listen to the noise on the battery tape deck
A Judas train wreck, anonymous suspect
Hovering in carbon monoxide cremations
Loners waste away inside of vacant locations
Think tanks empty, international dream bank
Plug in my reactor to the fallout zone
The enemies' story is a lot like mine
And if you get to the point then you know better than I

Dark star, like an eye that's closing
Sees through the shards from a scar that's open

Autopilot drivers riding out on the ice age
Infidels swallowed in a vanishing point
Ammunition souls shooting holes in the ozone
Widow's tears washing the soldier's bones
Sterilized egos delirium sequels
Punctured by the arrows of American eagles
Robot to teach you all the rules that delete you
Backspace my brain, my equilibrium goes
Dark star, just an eye that is closing
Sees through the shards from a scar that's open

One, two 
You know what to doEmbed
