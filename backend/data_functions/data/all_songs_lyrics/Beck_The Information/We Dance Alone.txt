We Dance Alone LyricsSend a telegram, tell me your thoughts
I wanna live for a day in the way that we lost
But unfortunately, the Twain got crissed not crossed
Left the keys in the car so the legs have to walk
On a desert terrain, we were wayward and plain
Waiting for rain in a decade afraid
Of what pain might do to the pleasure we knew
Before we had to move on I did my best for you
Darker, we dance alone this way
It's getting darker, we dance alone this way
I waited for a fire to come out of the ground
I tried to get back on the world as it was turning around
Splinters and pieces from a life that crashed
Watching every minute of the wreckage go past
'Cause motions wearing down all my thoughts
'Til they're all smoothed out like rocks we tossed
Ducks and drakes over water we go
Where we see there's only memories drowning below
On a gravel train, we were waiting for hope
I was a light fading out like a stray on a rope
I let the scenery pass like a blown-out TV
Thought I saw a ghost but it might have been me
Might have been the world that was moving too fast
Caught up in the future that was drunk on the past
Now looking for a place where the nights unravel
Last ditch road trespassers travel onEmbed
