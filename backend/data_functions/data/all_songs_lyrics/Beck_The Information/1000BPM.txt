1000BPM Lyrics
Electronic eye vision, astromagnetic
Corrupted files from galactical planets
Write a new genetic code
Thoughts get transported
From neanderthal skulls
To digital food malls
Telemarketing people
With cellular headsets on their skulls
Selling you wisdom
From a Plexiglas prism
Biochemical jism
Hits you with its rhythm
They act like Earth
Was a terrestrial prison
A zoo for humans
Put their cities into ruins
Now we can feel what we're doin'
Renew the stratosphere in plastic
Wonder out aloud, spastic
What else can the dust try to tell us?

Coming to you
One thousand beats per minute 
Categorize the Antichrist
With credentials
And a backstage pass
Gasoline in a flask
Tried to pull off his mask
But there was really his face
Repackaged meat from a plant
Security cameras strapped to his back
Failed prescriptions, antidotes
With media in a quarantine submission
Consultants revoke their souls
With unanimous votes
Portions of the proceeds
Go to chain store victims
In remission conditions
With remodeled kitchens
