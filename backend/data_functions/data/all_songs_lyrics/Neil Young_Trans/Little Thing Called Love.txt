Little Thing Called Love Lyrics
See somebody
Walking down the street
Hanging head
And a-shuffling feet
Don't take much to see
What they've been thinking of
What makes you hypnotized?
What puts a tear in your eye?
What makes you have to choose?
What brings you the blues?
A little thing called love 

Only love puts a tear in your eye
Only love makes you hypnotized
Only love makes you choose
Only love brings you the blues

Wait a minute now, honey
Don't be sad
This may be the best love you ever had
That don't mean that you had enough
A little thing called love 

A little thing called love Embed
