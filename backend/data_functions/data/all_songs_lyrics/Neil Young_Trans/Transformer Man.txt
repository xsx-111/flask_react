Transformer Man Lyrics
Transformer man, transformer man
You run the show remote control
Direct the action with the push of a button
You're a transformer man
Power in your hand
Transformer man, transformer man

Transformer man, transformer man
Sooner or later you'll have to see
The cause and effect
So many things still left to do
But we haven't made it yet
Every morning
When I look in your eyes
I feel electrified by you. Oh yes

Transformer man, transformer man
Transformer man, still in command
You're eyes are shining on a beam
Through the galaxy of love
Transformer man, transformer man
Unlock the secrets
Let us throw off the chains that
Hold you down

Transformer man, transformer man Embed
