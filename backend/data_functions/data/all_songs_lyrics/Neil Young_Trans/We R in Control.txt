We R in Control Lyrics
We control the data banks
We control the think tanks
We control the flow of air
We're controlling traffic lights
We control computer flights
We control the chief of staff
We control the TV sky
We control the FBI
We control the flow of heat
Computer age in harm's way
We will prevail
And perform our function
C.C.T.B

We're controlling 
We control
We're controlling
We control 

We control you floor to floor
We control you door to door
We're controlling
While you sleep
Computer age in harm's way
We will prevail
And perform our function
C.C.T.B
Computer age in harm's way
We will prevail
And perform our function
C.C.T.B
We are in control
