Computer Cowboy Lyrics
Well, his cattle each have numbers
And they all eat in a line
When he turns the floodlights
On each night
Of course the herd looks perfect!
Computer Cowboy
Well, he rides the range until midnight
And the wild coyotes yowl
As he trots beneath the floodlights
And of course the rhythm is perfect!
Computer Cowboy
Ride along computer cowboy
To the city just in time
To bring another system down
And leave your alias behind

Come a ky ky yippee yi yippee yi ay
Come a ky ky yippee yi ay
Come a ky ky yippee yi yippee yi ay
Come a ky ky yippee yi ay
