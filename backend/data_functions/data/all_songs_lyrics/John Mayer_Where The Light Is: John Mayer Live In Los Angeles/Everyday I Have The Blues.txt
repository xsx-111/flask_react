Everyday I Have The Blues Lyrics
Everyday
Everyday I have the blues
Everyday
Everyday I have the blues
When you see me worried baby
Because
It's you I hate to lose
Oh, nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care
Yes, nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care
Speaking of bad luck
And trouble
Well you know
I had my share

I'm going to pack my suitcase
Move on down the line
Yes
I'm going to pack my suitcase
Move on down the line
Where there
Isn't nobody worried
And there
Isn't nobody cryingEmbed
