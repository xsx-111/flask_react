Vultures Lyrics
Some of us, we're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number?
How will I hold my head
To keep from going under?

Down to the wire
I wanted water
But I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps
Testing me, testing me, testing me

How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding
Right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're trying to ride it out
Because they've never gone this long
Without a kill before
Down to the wire
I wanted water
But I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps
Testing me, testing me, testing me


Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
Can't seem to shake these vultures
Off of my trail
Power is made, by pure manipulation
So I keep on running
To protect my situation

Down to the wire
I wanted water
But I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps
Testing me, testing me, testing me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Whatcha going to do about it?
Whatcha going to do about it?
Whatcha going to do about it?
Dont give up, give up
Dont give up, give up, give up
Dont you give up
Dont give up, give up, give upEmbed
