Bold As Love Lyrics
Anger, he smiles, towering
In shiny metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters
Taken for granted, they quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on

But they're all, they're bold as love
Yeah, they're all, they're bold as love
They're all, they're bold as love
Just ask the axis

My red is so confident that he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is a young, full of daring
But it's very unsteady for the first go round
My yellow, in this case is not too mellow
In fact I'm trying to say, it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
But I'm, I'm bold, I'm bold as love
Yeah, I'm bold, I'm bold as love
I'm bold, I'm bold as love
Just as the axis

Alright so check it out, right
I've tried every approach to living
I've tried, tried it all
I haven't tried everything, but I've tried every approach
Sometimes, you don't have to try everything
To get the approach the same, but
I've tried it all
I bought a bunch of stuff I went ehh I don't like that
I kinda came in and out of that a couple times
I thought I would shut myself off
I thought maybe that's cool
Maybe that's what you have to do to be a genius
Is you have to be mad, so
If you get mad before the word genius
Then maybe you can make genius appear, right?
That doesn't work either
And I'm-
I'm in a good place, I paced myself pretty well
I'm thirty, I've seen some cool stuff
Made a lot of stuff happen for myself
I made a lot of stuff happen for myself, right
That's a really cool sentence when you're in your twenties
"I made it happen for myself, right"
But all that means is that I just somehow or another
Found a way to synthesize or synthesize soothing
You can't get that
And what I'm saying is that
I've messed with all the approaches except for one
And it's gonna sound really corny
But that's just love
That's just looove
I've done everything in my life that I wanna do
Except just give and feel love for my living
And I don't mean like uhhhh
Roman candle-firework-Hollywood-hot-pink-love
I mean like... I got your back love
I don't need to hear "I love you"
You guys love me
I love you
We got that down
But some of the people who will tell you that they love you
Are the same people who were the last
To just have your back
So I'm gonna experience with this love thing
Giving love, feeling love
I know it sounds really corny
But it's the last thing I got to check out before I check out
Take me to the solo one more time
Make it loud thank you

I'm bold, I'm bold as love, yeah
I'm bold, I'm bold as love
Hear me talking to you
I'm bold, I'm bold as love, yeah
