Who Did You Think I Was Lyrics
I got half a smile and zero shame
I got a reflection with a different name

Got a brand new blues that I can't explain

Who did you think I was?

Every mornin', when the day begins
I make up my mind, then change it back, again

I've been a shifter of the shape I'm in

Who did you think I was?

You got my number, but I always knew the score

Who did you think I was?
Am I the one who plays the quiet songs?
Or is he the one who turns the ladies on?

Will I keep shining 'til my light is gone?

Who did you think I was?

You got my number, but I always knew the score

Who did you think I was?



Here is a line that you won't understand:
I'm half of a boy, but I'm twice the man
Carry the weight of the world in the palm of my hand

Who did you think I was?
Who did you think I was?5Embed
