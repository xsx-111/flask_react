Come When I Call LyricsWhy won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just want to know you girl is all
You've got to know baby
Everybody's free sometime
You've got to know baby
Everybody's free sometime
Could you get to spare a moment?
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Friday night you're busy; something else to do
Saturday you're sleepin'
You've got work on Sunday too
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just want to know you girl is all
Keep the motor runnin'
Leave you're jacket on
If I had my way you would be drivin' home at dawn
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just, I just want to know you girl is all
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just, just want to know you girl is allEmbed
