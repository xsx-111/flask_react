Out Of My Mind Lyrics
I'm putting you baby
I'm putting you right out of my mind
I'm putting you baby
I'm putting you right out of my mind
So tired of running after you girl
And being one and one half steps behind

Go tell your friends now
Go tell your friends what Johnny did
Go tell your friends
Go tell your friends just what Johnny did
If they don't tell you that you're crazy baby
Lord, they're as messed up as you are
(Let me play my guitar people)
(Let me play my guitar people)
