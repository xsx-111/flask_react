Good Love Is On The Way Lyrics
I'm a lazy lover
Undercover
Wasting time
Then, one day this summer
I changed my number
To cut my line

Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know I'll be okay
Good love is on the way

3 years, broken-hearted
Now her ghost is finally gone
I'm done with broken people
This is me I'm working on (because I know)

Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know I'll be okay
Good love is on the way

Good to go for wherever I'm needed
Bags are packed and I'm down by the door
You can have all the tricks up my sleeve
I don't need them anymore
Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know I'll be okay
Good love is on the way

Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know I'll be okay
Good love is on the way3Embed
