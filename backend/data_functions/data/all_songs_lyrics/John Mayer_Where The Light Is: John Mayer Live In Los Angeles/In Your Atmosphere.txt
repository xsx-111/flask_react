In Your Atmosphere Lyrics
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't know what it's like to land
And not race to your door
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to your hotel key
And your bedroom neighborhood
And be sleepwalking in Hollywood

I'm going to steer clear
Or burn up in your atmosphere
I'm going to steer clear
Because I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore

I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I'd get lost on the boulevard at night
Without your voice to tell me
"I love you, take a right"
The ten and the two is the loneliest sight
I'm going to steer clear
Or burn up in your atmosphere
I'm going to steer clear
Because I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore

I think I'm going to stay
Going to stay in the gray
Think I'm going to stay
And all the street lights say
"Never mind, never mind"
And the canyon lines say
"Never mind, never mind"
The sunset says
"We see this all the time"
Never mind, never you mind

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar7Embed
