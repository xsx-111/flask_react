Feelings Lyrics
Feelings, nothing more than feelings
Trying to forget my feelings of hate
Imagine beating on your face
Trying to forget my feelings of hate

Feelings, all my life I'll feel it
I wish I'd never met you, you'll make me sick again
Feelings, whoa feelings
Whoa feelings, hate on my mind

Feelings, feelings like I never liked you
Feelings like I want to kill you live in my heart
Feelings, feelings like I want to deck you
Feelings like I've got to get you out of my life

Feelings, whoa feelings
Whoa feelings, the hate's in my eyes
Feelings, whoa feelings
Whoa feelings, you're not very nice
Go!
Feelings, whoa feelings
Whoa feelings
The hate's on my mind

Feelings, whoa feelings
Whoa feelings
Get out of my life1Embed
