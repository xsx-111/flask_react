No Brakes Lyrics
Lay awake, I don't give a shit
If I even ever wake up in the morning
Down below, there's a pile of sin
Always waiting for a, waiting for a warning

Burned at the stake, inside I'm blistering
Not a whisper, looking in you'd never know it
Miles below, I look up again
When you snap, they say before you never show it

Someone said it's all right
Save it now, don't say it for my sake
Someone said it's all right
Faster now, you know I got no brakes
No brakes!

Fuses glow, wounds are festering
'Til the wind comes up and takes it to the last "Pow"
Back and forth, staring at the wall
This room's a cage, I know that something's got to give now
Lay awake, I don't give a shit
If I even ever wake up in the morning
Down below, there's a pile of sin
Always waiting for a, waiting for a warning

Someone said it's all right
Save it now, don't say it for my sake
Someone said it's all right
Faster now, you know I got no brakes
No brakes!


Someone said it's all right
Save it now, don't say it for my sake
Someone said it's all right
Faster now, you know I got no brakes
Someone said it's all right
Save it now, don't say it for my sake
Someone said it's all right
Faster now, you know I got no brakes
No brakes!
No brakes!
No brakes!
No brakes!Embed
