Staring at the Sun Lyrics
Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway
Dodging bullets while you're trying to find your way
Everyone's around, but no one does a damn thing
It brings me down, but I won't let them

If I seem bleak, well, you'd be correct
And if I don't speak, it's 'cause I can't disconnect
But I won't be burned by the reflection of the fire in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun

Whoa
As you're staring at the sun
Whoa
As you're staring at the sun

When I ran, I didn't feel like a runaway
When I escaped, I didn't feel like I got away
There's more to living than only surviving
Maybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying

Though you hear me, I don't think that you relate
My will is something that you can't confiscate
So forgive me, but I won't be frustrated by destruction in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun
Whoa
As you're staring at the sun

When I ran, I didn't feel like a runaway
When I escaped, I didn't feel like I got away
There's more to living than only surviving
Maybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying

Though you hear me, I don't think that you relate
My will is something that you can't confiscate
So forgive me, but I won't be frustrated by destruction in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun

Whoa
As you're staring at the sun
Whoa
As you're staring at the sun

Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway
Dodging bullets while you're trying to find your way
Everyone's around, but no one does a damn thing
It brings me down, but I won't let them
If I seem bleak, well, you'd be correct
And if I don't speak, it's 'cause I can't disconnect
But I won't be burned by the reflection of the fire in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun

Whoa
As you're staring at the sun
Whoa
As you're staring at the sun
Whoa
As you're staring at the sun4Embed
