Me and the Moon Lyrics
Darling, you can be so unforgiving
You can be so unloving
You can be misunderstanding
But I don't know how to feel without your love
So tell me what to do

It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky
It's a lovely night with that look in your eye
But you still sleep with your back to me
Is it me and you or is it me and the moon?

Oh baby, I thought that you forgave me
I thought that you still loved me
Don't you need me?
I want it forever
(Forever, forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever)

It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky
It's a lovely night with that look in your eye
But you still sleep with your back to me
Is it me and you or is it me and the moon?
It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky
It's a lovely night with that look in your eye
But you still sleep with your back to me
Is it me and you?
It's another night with the moon in the sky
It's another night with that look in your eye
But you still sleep with your back to me
Is it me and you? Or is it me and the moon?11Embed
