Book of Stories Lyrics
Your perfect photographs on the wall
And if I know you, you're okay
I don't wanna dance anymore
I don't wanna sing anymore
I don't wanna dance anymore
We used to sing

I thought I'd be okay 'til I hit that floor
I thought I'd be fine 'til I needed more
I thought I'd be okay 'til I hit that floor
Oh, I need more, I need more, I need more, I need more

I thought my life would get easier
Instead it's getting harder, instead it's getting harder
I thought my life would get easier
Instead it's darker, instead it's getting colder
Without you

My life's a book of short stories
And we wrote a new one everyday
I don't understand anymore
You don't love me anymore
I don't understand anymore and I can't think
I thought I'd be okay 'til I hit that floor
I thought I'd be fine 'til I needed more
I thought I'd be okay 'til I hit that floor
Oh, I need more, I need more, I need more, I need more

I thought my life would get easier
Instead it's getting harder, instead it's getting harder
I thought my life would get easier
Instead it's darker, instead it's getting colder
Without you

Why can't I let you go?
Why can't I let you go?
Hate you, I wanted to hate you, I wanted to hate you, I wanted to hate you
Hate you, I wanted to hate you, I wanted to hate you, I wanted to hate you

I thought my life would get easier
Instead it's getting harder, instead it's getting harder
I thought my life would get easier
Instead it's darker, instead it's getting colder
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you3Embed
