Best Friend Lyrics
You are my best friend, but then you died
When I was 23 and you were 25
You are my best friend, but then you died
And how will I survive, survive, survive, survive?
Oh, how will I survive, survive, survive, survive?

And every day I waited for you
And every day on the top of your car
Every day I waited for you
And every day on the hood of your car
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah

Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I had a dream of you, you were drifting away
You were sad and the ocean dripped away
And I know you're gonna be okay
'Cause I can see it in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
And I know I'm gonna survive, survive, survive, survive
And every day I waited for you
And every day on the top of your car
Every day I waited for you
And every day on the hood of your car
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah

Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

And every day I waited for you
And every day on the top of your car
Every day I waited for you
And every day on the hood of your car
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah5Embed
