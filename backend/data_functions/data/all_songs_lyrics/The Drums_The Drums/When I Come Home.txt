When I Come Home LyricsI've been gone too long
I know i've been gone far too long
And since I left home
You're still the one I dream of
Who do you dream of?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
When I get home and you open up the door
I'll lift my head, I'll look into your eyes
You look into my eyes
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
I'm coming home baby
I'm coming home baby
I'm coming home baby
I'm coming home baby
I'm coming home baby
I'm coming home baby
I'm coming home baby
I'm coming home baby
I'm coming home baby
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?Embed
