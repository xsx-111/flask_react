The Future Lyrics
Here I go again
Getting upset over nothing
Getting upset over your heart
Over your heart
Over your heart
And if I ruled the world
I would make every country salute you
And if I ruled the world
I'd make you be mine

And I'm always in your cage
Set me free
And you've locked me in your cage
Set me free

Here you go again
Walking away like it's nothing
Walking away from my heart
But I see your eyes at night
And you know what's wrong
And you know what's right

And I'm always in your cage
Set me free
And you've locked me in your cage
Set me free
The future
Oh, oh
The future
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

And I'm always in your cage
Set me free
And you've locked me in your cage
Set me free6Embed
