We Tried Lyrics
I needed a place to go
Yeah, that's what you told me
So I went to your house to try to find you in your room
Why can't I find you now?

Walking alone tonight
Wishing you were still here
Wishing things were all right

We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died

We took down the icicles
The way they melt in your hand
You told me you loved me at an age I didn't understand
I didn't understand

Walking alone tonight
Wishing you were still here
Wishing things were alright
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died

Where will we go when we get old?
Where will we go when we get old, old?

We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died
We tried, oh yeah, we tried2Embed
