Down by the Water Lyrics
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home

Everybody’s gotta love someone
But I just wanna love you dear
Everybody’s gotta feel something
I just wanna be with you, you my dear
I know its hard, I know its hard
I know its hard to be in this position
If they stop loving you, I won’t stop loving you
If they stop needing you, I’ll still need you my dear

If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home

You gotta believe me when I say
When I say the word forever
And whatever comes your way
We’ll still be here together
I know its hard, I know its hard
But I understand you, just take my hand
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home5Embed
