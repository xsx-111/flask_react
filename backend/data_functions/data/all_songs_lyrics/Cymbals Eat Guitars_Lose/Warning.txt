Warning LyricsPennants stiffen on the strip
Wind is whipping through the tinsel
Fixed to the dealership
And you're looking mighty ghostly
Just like Bowie on Soul Train
Wrapped in your sable
Letâ€™s throw some brake light in the night
Oh, it looks so nice to me, I know
So what I wasn't having no nightmares
Probably cause I couldn't catch the REM

Warning
I am some kind of handful
Empty as a dream Grand Central
When I leave
Gonna need my body
The shape of true love is terrifying enough
Hope you're telling me the truth
Getting goosebumps on your roof
Friendship's the biggest myth
Heart is skipping like a Cessna stalling out and falling free
Live in the space between
Call the cat in from the dark
Sing "Born Free" on the porch
My love lives on
A positive sobriety birthday
A fifth remission anniversary
Warning
I am some kind of handful
Empty as a dream Grand Central
When I leave
Gonna need my body
The shape of true love is terrifying enoughEmbed
