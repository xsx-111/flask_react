Chambers LyricsThe Feds closed Silk Road
And I'm out in the cold
Cause I don't know anyone
Lights out in South Beach
Coming up on seven weeks
Need a pill to sleep so I
Drive up to Stapleton
Even though I'm not dumb enough
To enter the Chambers
No smokes so I sniff my coat
Wait for the early boat
My veins are electric
Technically NYC
Dear Christ does it get lonely?

The panic sets in
Though nothing's happening
Days of the same old shit
But I'll miss all of it
Baby's got cataracts
Her coat was shining black
Now it's grey and patchy
Sunshine caught in her eyes
Is from a different time
Had a big yard in Barnegat
She's shambling history
She sleeps on rubber sheets
She's deaf but she listens to me
Our parents got us a dog
So we'd learn about loss
It's a slow education
While I'm away on tour
She sniffs beneath my door it's true

The panic sets in
Though nothing's happening
Days of the same old shit
But I'll miss all of it
You won't believe the things I've seen
Since the last time we met

Where'd you go?
Here's what it felt like
When I was 25
Still had my family
Missed them already

The panic sets in
Cause nothing's happening
Days of the same old shit
But I'll miss all of it1Embed
