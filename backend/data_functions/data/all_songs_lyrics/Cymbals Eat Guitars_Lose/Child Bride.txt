Child Bride LyricsChild Bride
You were my best friend
‘Til your dad slapped the living shit out of you
In front of me
And I could see
You leave your body
And I knew we were through
Well you let me keep your Dreamcast
When she picked up and moved you south
You didn’t say
And I went one day to call on you
And found an empty house
Skeletor of the liquor store
The bitch took you away
Some years later I played in Orlando
You came out and your hair was box dye black
You told me all about your new girlfriend
How she turned you on to crack
I said, "Man, I can’t
My heart would
My heart would explode"
Slow the years down
Lose your twenties
Loaded all the time
