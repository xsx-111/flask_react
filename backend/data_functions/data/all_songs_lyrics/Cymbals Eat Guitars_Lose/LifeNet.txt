LifeNet LyricsI'm pretty sick of that dolphin smile
Coney Island is a film between the guardrails
Angels spread in the sky like ink in water
Upper level I am feeling fine with the
Arrow of time
You would piss on my jellyfish sting
I think you'd do just about anything
To be a member of my family
Our future flashing in the sheets of lightning
Living in fear of thunder no one else can hear

I'm sorry
You don't know these people so
What could this mean to you?
They're history
Well, this won't make a difference
There's radiation living for a million years
The candle in your jack-o-lantern
It's what makes you walk and talk and smoke and sing
You're primping in the mirror naked
My reflection in the diamond that your thighs make
Hot in my chest, the queasy rising emptiness

Gettin' laid in the black sand
There's nothing left to confess
You have now seen all of my ugliness
