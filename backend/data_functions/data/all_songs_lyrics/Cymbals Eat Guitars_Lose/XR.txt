XR LyricsBroke my bong on purpose
Hit the ceiling with weed
The summer benzo blackouts
Erased my identity
At Vintage Vinyl to score some CDs
For ripping rails not listening
This is starting to scare me
The three perfect chords get me closer to heaven
Been mapping the abyss since 2007
Here I am again at Ben’s MySpace grave
And then out of nowhere
The smell of his basement
Where we watched Faces of Death
And we regretted it
Imagining victory
Our alternate history
The songs we never wrote
They float above and below me
Keepsake tinnitus shrieks me to sleep
Each frequency’s a memory of some
Show we attended
Fuck your learner’s permit
Drive down to Philly with me
To see the Wrens in a rec room
Out in the street our heat turns to steam
And every surface is mercury glass
Wanna wake up wanting to listen to records
But those old feelings elude me
I raise a toast to the rock n’ roll ghost
But it ain’t whiskey
It’s Emergen-C
Almost died a thousand times
High is just a tingling behind my eyes
Got no serotonin left
Signed away your right to be forgotten
