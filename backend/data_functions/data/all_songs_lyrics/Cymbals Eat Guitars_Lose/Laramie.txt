Laramie LyricsWe got caught in Laramie
Snowstorm closed down I-80
We got lushed with strangers at the Spike
Threw pink brake light out into the night
Useless diamond
The vacant city gleams
Sparkling highways empty ‘cept for me
Stillborn Summer, a cold reality
Warm waves, plastic sunshine fills me
All alone with my strip mall memories
Chasing the chills I felt when I was eighteen
Both in need of rescue
So who saves whom?
In your car had “I Guess We’re Done” duels
I’ll do the Kev and you can do the Charles
We were both in need of rescue
So who saved whom?
Derealization
Half a decade on
A house show in Caldwell
Forward 13 months
The innocence ended when I got the call
Your street's just a place it has no memory at all
