The Heretic Anthem Lyrics
(Eight-seven-six-six-six-five-four-three-two-one-zero)
Yeah

I'm a pop star threat, and I'm not dead yet
Got a super dread bet with an angel drug head
Like a dead beat winner, I wanna be a sinner
An idolized bang for the industry killer
A hideous man that you don't understand
Throw a suicide party, and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap
It's evilsonic, it's pornoholic
Breakdowns, obscenities, it's all I wanna be

If you're five-five-five, then I'm six-six-six
If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
But if you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
What's it like to be a heretic?

Everybody's so infatuated
Everybody's so completely sure of what we are
Everybody defamates from miles away
But face to face, they haven't got a thing to say
I bleed for this, and I bleed for you
Still, you look in my face like I'm somebody new
Toy, nobody wants anything I've got
Which is fine because you're made of everything I'm not
If you're five-five-five, then I'm six-six-six
If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
But if you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
What's it like to be a heretic?

Yeah
Heretic, yeah

Thirty seconds, sixteen, eight, four, let me tell you why
I haven't the slightest, I'm teaching your brightest
They're listening, clamoring
All the money in the world can't buy me
Go ahead, lie to me
Tell me again how you're tortured
I wanna know how you followed your orders so well
You're full of shit, you had a dream, but this ain't it

If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
No
If you're five-five-five, then I'm six-six-six
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're five-five-five, then I'm six-six-six
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're five-five-five, then I'm six-six-six
What's it like to be a heretic?

Heretic
