Gently Lyrics
Gently my mind escapes
Into the relaxing world of pleasure
A pleasure that'll take my mind
Off the reality of my life
My past life, life as I know it now
And whatever may come, it slowly disappears
To somewhere in the back of my mind
It will remain there
Until I wish to retrieve it
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Yeah
Yes, I will stay here for a while, for I need the break
A break from the pressures of life
And everything that lays in the palm of life's hands
Life's hands
Yeah
Ooh
This mode is incredible
It's out of this world
Too bad I must always leave it
But that's life
That's life, yeah
That's life, yeah
That's life, yeah
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Oh, yes6Embed
