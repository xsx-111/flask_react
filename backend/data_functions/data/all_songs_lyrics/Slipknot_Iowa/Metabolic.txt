Metabolic Lyrics
Gone, I couldn't murder your promise
Right before my eyes
The revolutions of my psychosis
Kept me outta the way
Once inside all I hold is ash
Fail, suppressing every feeling
I'm in so much pain
I have every fucking right to hate you
I can't take it
The hardest part was knowing that I could never be you
Now all I do is sit around and wish I could forget you

My demise
I took a life worth living and made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
Stop!
I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop!
I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop!
I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop!
I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Who are you to me? Who am I to you?
Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence?
By default, you are my only link to the outside
Psychosomatic suicide
Where were you when I was down?
Can you show me a way
To face every day with this face?
Goodbye

My demise, I took a life worth living and made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me

Oh, when I blur my eyes, they make the whole world breathe
I see you fucking me
And I am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate
The one and only answer so much for memories
I wanna dress in your insecurities
And be the perfect you, I'm through
I'm out-stretched out for all to loathe
Here we go, the ultimate irony
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My demise, I took a life worth living and made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me

Stop, killing me
Stop, killing me
Stop, killing, stop, me
