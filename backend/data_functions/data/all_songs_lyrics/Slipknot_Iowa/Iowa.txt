Iowa Lyrics
“Yea!”
“Haha..”
“Ah...”
“Ahahah..”
“AHA...”

Relax, it's over
You belong to me, I fill your mouth with dirt
Relax, it's over
You can never leave, I take your second digit with me, love
“Ah...”

You are my first
I can barely breathe, I find you fascinating
You are my favorite
Lay you down to sleep, it's all that I can do to stop, love
“Ah...”
So blue, so broken
Paper doll decays, I haven't left you yet
So cold, subversive
Your eyes are full of bleach, tomorrow I will go away again, love
“Love...”
“Ah..”
“Oh, god..”
“Oh, god!”
“It tears us/It makes us”
“It makes all One!”
“It tears us APART...”
“It tears us apart!”
“It cuts us/it cuts us all..”
“I can't breathe..”

You are mine
You will always be mine
I can tear you apart
I can recombine you
All I want is to covet you all
You belong to me
I will kill you to love you (love you)
“YOU FUCKING BITCH...”
“Fuck you”
“FUCKING BITCH!”
“Do you see?”
“Do You See”
“DO YOU SEE!”
“It's you and I, love”
“Ah”
“You..”
(emtakooltnod)
“You..”
“You and I..”
“I can smell you..”
“Ahh...”
“I can smell you all over me!”
“Hahah...”

I fucking- told you...
(Fucking told you...)
I Fucking told you!
You'll live forever!
“Haha..”
(You will live forever)13Embed
