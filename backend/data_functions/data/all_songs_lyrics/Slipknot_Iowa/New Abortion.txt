New Abortion Lyrics
Yeah

I'm ethereal
My children are legion, serial
They stick to my skin like beloved cysts
I tear away with my nails and teeth and fists
Touch the hands of inverted saints
Follow my heart through the threaded pain
Callow man is a sentinel screaming
I see the future, the future is bleeding

Sores
Every goddamn minute I can feel 'em now
Like a virus, you will never kill me now
Going underground, coming on like hepatitis
We're out, and you can't reshape us
Another bug in the construct
Tearing up the main bus B
Zeros and ones are everything, execute me

Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
You can't take my soul away from me
What do you need to see? You feel the impact?
Gotta retract; everybody, get back
What is this? It's like a big conspiracy
Fields of dejected morbid progeny
They always say that it's always our fault
But everything we say is taken with a grain of salt
Man, it's always the same if we talk or complain
We only wanna upset the balance
How's it feel to be the new abortion?
The only generation to suffer extortion

Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see

You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me

Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
You can't take my soul away from me
Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
Fuck you3Embed
