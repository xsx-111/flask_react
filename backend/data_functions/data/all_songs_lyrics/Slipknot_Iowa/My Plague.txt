My Plague Lyrics
I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the everyday
Bullshit things that you have done
Your impossible ego fuck
Is like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that shit you call a heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't mind being ogled, ridiculed, made to feel minuscule
If you consider the source, it's kinda pitiful
The only thing you really know about me is
That's all you'll ever know

I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

I'm turning it around like a knife on the shelf
I wanna understand why, but I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lotta reasons to stop it, I can't just drop it
I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it, at least I admit it
I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

Yeah

Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you, you
Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you, you
I can't fucking take it anymore
A snap of the synapse, and now it's fucking war
Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you, you

I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself
I know you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself
Well, I know why you blame yourself
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you plague yourself4Embed
