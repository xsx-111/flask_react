Live It Up LyricsGotta find my destination, GPS on rotation, baby
Try and take a vacation at night
I went eastbound on the highway, highway of love, highway of love
Meet you down at the bright spot, baby
24 on the dot you know, baby
Tell me is the right spot or not
Friday night at the chateau marmont, let's go
Yeah, come on, live it up all night long
Yeah, live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up all night long
It's far too late to make this okay
I'm write a song when I don't know what to say
First line is the hardest for me
Everything means the same in reverse, now let's go
Yeah, live it up now, baby, let's live it up, live it up all night long
Yeah, live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up all night long
Dubstep or duck stab, baby, save your pretties for me baby
Cosmonaut every night my dreams, take a walk in my holodeck, baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up all night long
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up, live it upEmbed
