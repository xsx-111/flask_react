Symphony of the Nymph LyricsShe's a nympho at the discotheque
She's a nympho and I'm a lesbian
And yet I'm also a nympho
She's a nympho at the bibliotheque
Dr. Mario, colonoscopist
Down in the Barrio, I'm a therapist
Yes I'm a nympho, yes I'm a nympho
My name is Ariel and I'm a nympho
(Why do you have to sing?
Why do you have to go singing?
Do you have to sing?
'Cause I'm gonna sing, why do you have to sing?
Why do you have to sing?
Why do you have to go singing?
Do you have to sing?
So what can I do for you to please me too?)

The symphony of the nymph
I don't need to burn any bridges
But I can't get enough of those bitches
I'm just a rocknrolla from Beverly Hills
My name is Ariel, and I'm a nymph!
The nymphony of the symph
She's a nympho at the discotheque
She's a nympho and I'm a lesbian
And yet I'm also a nympho
She's a nympho at the bibliotheque
Dr. Mario, colonoscopist
Down in the Barrio, I'm a therapist
Yes I'm a nympho, yes I'm a nympho
My name is Ariel and I'm a nympho
(Why do you have to sing?
Why do you have to go singing?
Do you have to sing?
'Cause I'm gonna sing, why do you have to sing?
Why do you have to sing?
Why do you have to go singing?
Do you have to sing?
So what can I do for you to please me too?)

Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup girl
Giddyup girl

The symphony of the nymph
I don't wanna burn any bridges
But I can't get enough of those bitches
I'm just a rocknrolla from Beverly Hills
My name is Ariel Pink!
