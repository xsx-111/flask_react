Kinski Assassin Lyrics
A Kinski assassin blew a hole in my chest
Now I walk up out with the dream bullet vest
A seaworthy vessel for the sperm-headed brain
Mother twin genesis went down with the plane

Kinski assassins, of angels and Athens

Hey, who sunk my battleship
Hey, I sank my battleship
Heyy, who sunk my battleship
Hey, I sank my battleship!
Crib notes pacifistic polymonogamasturbators
A whore (that's right)

Kinski assassins, of angels and Athens

Whit clad Darth Vadors splaying truth but not fact
Conihilators that dupe and distract, paramour

I will always, I will always have Paris
I will always, I will always have Paris
Kinski assassins, of angels and Athens

Australian-made nibblers with the steam pocket slacks
Backlit Jacuzziwad will fondle yer ass
Suicide dumplings dropping testicle bombs, bombs, bombs
Kick-outs in technicolor talk to yer moms

Kinski Assassins, double agents and Athens

Hey, who sunk my battleship
Hey, I sank my battleship
Who sank my battleship
I sank my battle trip
Passocist masochist, polymonogamasturbators ahoy
Like Jung Sigmund Freud

Kinski Assassins, double agents and Athens

Blond seizure bombshells and the blowjobs of death
Bring on the bogan shemales hopped up on meth
I will always, I will always have Paris
I will always, I will Always have Paris
Kinski Assassins of angels and Athens

Hey, who sunk my battleship
Hey, I sank my battletrip
Hey, who sunk my battleship
Hey, I sank my battleship
Hey, who sunk my battleship
Hey, I sank my battleship
Fa la la la la! That's right!2Embed
