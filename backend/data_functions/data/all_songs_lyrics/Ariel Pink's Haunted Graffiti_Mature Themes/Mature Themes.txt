Mature Themes Lyrics
To be young, as a girl, with a boy to be one
For I solemnly devote myself to thee
I'm sorry, but it's true
Truth is shameful and vile
So I'm not real and I won't call you
And I want to talk about mature themes daily

And I want it to be good
I want it to be good
And I want it to be good, my baby
I want it to be good, to be good, to be good
And I want it to be good, baby

Now let's take steps to rectify your whole life
Take this gift I gave to thee
A promise to be true
Embrace, imagine imaginations that suit you
Yeah, I want to talk about mature themes, taboo themes

And I want it to be good
I want it to be good
And I want it to be good, my baby
I want it to be good, to be good, to be good
And I want it to be good, baby
I don't care at all 'bout the big or the small
The skies and the air between me
I don't care about you
I wish I was taller than 5'4"
35 years of my life spent
Computing it all, oh hell

And I want it to be good
I want it to be good
And I want it to be good, my baby
I want it to be good, to be good, to be good
And I want it to be good, baby1Embed
