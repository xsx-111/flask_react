Pink Slime LyricsDove le vore?
Lavore, escusao
Perfecto, andiamo
Let's dine on pink slime
Table for two!
I'll buy it next time
Pink slime is good for you!
Inside is drive side
And outside is shotgun
When inside meets passenger
You be backseat driver
Let's dine on pink slime
Pasta fazul!
Green eggs on pork rinds
Speckled with glue!
I made it for you
It's yummy yummy yummy too!
Left side down-song boys, say
Right side up song girl sing
Bread batter side up or
Bread batter side down
Triple sung jiggers, versus Pink Flamingos
(Like like don't care about life likelines)
And jigger rock snatch, pink slime
(Like like don't care about life likelines)
Triple sung jiggers, versus Pink Flamingos
(Like like don't care about life likelines)
Pink slime, pink slime, pink slime
(Like like don't care about life likelines)
Dove la borra
Lavore, escusao
Perfecto, andiamo
La La Li La,La La, La La, La La Li LaEmbed
