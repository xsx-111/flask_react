Nostradamus & Me LyricsReflecting on God's riverbank, cobblestone cabin yard
Me and Nos, Nostradamus
We road the alpha waves, we frolic on hill in dale
At night we walk, me and Nos
The Nos and me, Nostradamus and me
Goodbye! Bye-bye!
Soon the world of woe shall be overthrown
Over so long ago, over so long agoEmbed
