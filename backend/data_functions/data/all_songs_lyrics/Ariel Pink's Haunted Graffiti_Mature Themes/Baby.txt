Baby Lyrics
Oooh, baby
Oooh, baby

When we're out in the moonlight
Looking up at the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holding hands and making love

Ooh, ooh, baby
You're baby
You're baby
Yes, oh, baby

Sandy beach and just making love
As the tide moves in on us
Feels so good walking side by side
Want to be with you all my life

Ooh, ooh, baby
You're so baby
You're so baby
Yes, oh, baby
Dreams of you all the time
Feels so good, I want to get that right (Ha ha ha ha!)
Just can't wait until tomorrow
Hey come on, baby, let's shake it

Ooh, ooh, baby
You're so baby
You're so baby
Yes, oh, baby

When we're out in the moonlight
Looking up at the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holding hands and making love

Ooh, ooh, baby
You're so baby
You're so baby
Yes, oh, baby

Oooh, baby
Yes, oh, baby
Yes, oh, baby2Embed
