Early Birds of Babylon LyricsEarly birds of Babylon, rise up your time's at hand
Dawn your sharp beaks for the flesh rotted feat nihil
The birds are up at dawn and now the broads pissed, sire
In the days of dawn the gnostics saw the book of hell
Satanic spies
Satanic spies
Satanic spies
Satanic spies
Angels invocated by subconscious motives eat young
Fau the God of hell sit down, reside you mock the state of Israel
As you lay down to this godless Satan man made God pan
To seduce you lay upon your self, the truth is in your hands
A wash innocent death dissolve
Satanic spies
Satanic spies
Satanic spies
