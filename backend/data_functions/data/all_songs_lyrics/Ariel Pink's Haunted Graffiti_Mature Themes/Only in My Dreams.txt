Only in My Dreams LyricsIf at first you don't succeed at love
Just dream a little dream about a girl so real
When she don't call up no more, well
Never give up, you gotta believe it

If only in my dreams (only in my dreams)
If only in my dreams she'll be right there next to me
And if I could say, if only in my dreams
You're the luckiest girl
In the world there's no other more lucky in love, you don't have to explain it
Cause you're the one who's in love, and we'll have so much fun
On the beach, on the ocean of my dreamscape
Only in my dreams
If at first you don't succeed at love
Just dream a little dream about a girl so real
When she don't call up no more, well
Never give up, yeah, you gotta believe it

And if I could say, if only in my dreams
You're the luckiest girl
In the world there's no other girl luckier, you don't have to explain it
Cause you're the one who's in love, and we'll have so much fun
On the beach, on the ocean of my dreamscape
Only in my dreams
And if I could see that you'll be real with me
And we'll have so much fun, and it's just begun
If only in my dreams you're the luckiest girl
In the world there's no other more lucky in love, you don't have to explain
Cause you're the one who's in love
And we'll have so much fun
If only in my dreams1Embed
