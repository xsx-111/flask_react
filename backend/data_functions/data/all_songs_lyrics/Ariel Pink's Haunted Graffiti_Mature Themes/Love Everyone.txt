Love Everyone Lyrics
La la, la la la la
La la, la la la la
La la, la la la la
La la, la la la

I was  and had a fever
But it's all a trip to me, love
Had a sip of a damsel  magic potion
And then we got it all 

All lives co-mingle in time
Love is elixir of life

Love flies out your window
To the sound of the rain
It don't pay to be single, baby
But you can't have it both ways

Love is elixir of life
All lives co-mingle in time
Debates
Desire
The love that you require
It's all
Around
And makes the world go round

Love everyone
Love evеryone
Love evеryone
Love everyone

Tune in
It's time
Relax and lose your mind
Breathe in
The sound
It makes the world go round

Love everyone
Love everyone
Love everyone
Love everyone
 the poor man's opera
And every man needs a mate
People come and people go
I guess it's just the price you pay

All lives co-mingle in time
Love is elixir of life
Love is elixir

(When we're together, baby)
(Ooh, anything is possible)
(Anything is possible)
(Baby! )
(When we're together, baby. You and me!)
(That's )
