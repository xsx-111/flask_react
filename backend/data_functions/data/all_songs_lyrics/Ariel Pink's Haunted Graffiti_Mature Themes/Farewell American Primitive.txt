Farewell American Primitive Lyrics
You won't believe this
I sold your soul today
These hours between us
Will never fade away
As sad as it seems
It's like something in dreams

Fuck it, I'm hiding cause the winter
Makes me so sad
Bitter and cold now
My thoughts get sick and make me mad

Hello-hello Guantanamo bay
Farewell so long goodbye USA

Farewell American
Farewell American primitive
Native american immigrant
(Larry Parker got me 2.1 million)

I'm here in spirit
So don't hesitate to write
Bitter and cold now
My thoughts make me sick at night
But that isn't me
North Korea is me
Farewell American
Farewell american primitive
Native american immigrant
(Not my chair, not my problem)

Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
 Zimbabwe

You won't believe this
I sold your soul today
Those hours between us
Will never fade away
As sad as it seems
It's like something in dreams

Farewell American
Farewell American immigrant
Native american primitive
Farewell american primitive
Native American primitive
(It's your money, use it when you need it)Embed
