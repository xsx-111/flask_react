Let It Grow LyricsTaking time to find the right line
Talking easy with the thoughts you want to share
Leaning down, feel you knowing in my mind
Stealing down, going down, feel you growing in my mind
It's got to be slow
Taking love the only way
It's got to just flow
Making love and taking time to let it grow
Finding ways to find the real you
Spending days just holding hands and feeling free
Play around, watch the sunshine coming through
Come around, stay around, watch the loving grow with you
It's got to be slow
Taking love the only way
It's got to just flow
Making love and taking time to let it grow
Loving you, the love you give me
Living, loving with the things we have share
Poetry, hear the words you say to me
Stay with me, here with me, keep our loving flowing free
It's got to be slow
Taking love the only way
It's got to just flow
Making love and taking time to let it growEmbed
