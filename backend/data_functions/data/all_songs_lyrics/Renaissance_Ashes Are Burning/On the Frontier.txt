On the Frontier LyricsWe all are standing unafraid on the frontier
We all are shadows in the shade on the frontier
When the dawn is come we will stand strong
Where we belong
The day belongs to each of us our time is getting near
The way is wrong for each of us our time is getting near
The seeds of yesterday are breaking through
To you
We're on the frontier now
We're on the frontier now
We're on the frontier now
We're on the frontier now
We're on the frontier now
So come on leave the dark behind and join the day now
It's peaceful revolution time to join the day now
Morning breaks the light will shine and find the blind
We all are standing unafraid on the frontier
We all are shadows in the shade on the frontierEmbed
