Can You Understand Lyrics

Dollars down the penny drain
Frozen in the clouds
Dream away the last of pain
In waterfalls of sounds

Float across the icy pools
Leaves with curl and sway
Now your mind is floating cool
And you can find the way

Can you understand
You can really understand
When the darkness comes you still shine

Open up your eyes and make the day shine sunshine now
Open up your dreams and make the way shine sunshine now
Can you understand, do you understand?
Can you understand, do you understand?
Open up your life and make your lifetime sunshine now
Open up your soul and make your lifeline sunshine now
Can you understand, do you understand?
Can you understand, do you understand?

Dancing without moving now
Growing with your soul
One with all around you now
Related to the all

Purple mist around your hair
Eyes are fading blue
Smiling into everywhere
Love is coming throughEmbed
