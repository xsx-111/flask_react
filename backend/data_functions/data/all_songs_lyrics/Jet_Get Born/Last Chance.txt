Last Chance Lyrics
Could you just give me one more try at that?

You ain’t nothing to me if you got nothing to say
I don’t know what you got that I can use anyway

Last chance honey
Last chance honey
Yeah, this is your last chance honey
Last chance honey
Yeah, this is your last chance

You ain’t nothing to me so keep your money in check
I got something for you that you ain’t never gonna get
So come on

Last chance honey
Last chance honey
Yeah, this is your last chance honey
Last chance honey
Yeah, this is your last chance
Yeah, this is your last chance
Last chance honeyEmbed
