Are You Gonna Be My Girl Lyrics
Go!

So one, two, three
Take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine
I said, you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine

Oh, four, five, six
Come on and get your kicks
Now you don't need that money
When you look like that, do ya, honey?

Big black boots, long brown hair
She's so sweet with her get-back stare

Well, I could see you home with me
But you were with another man, yeah
I know we ain't got much to say
Before I let you get away, yeah
I said, are you gonna be my girl?

So one, two, three
Take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine
I said, you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine

Oh, four, five, six
Come on and get your kicks
Now you don't need that money
With a face like that, do ya?

Big black boots, long brown hair
She's so sweet with her get-back stare

Well, I could see you home with me
But you were with another man, yeah
I know we ain't got much to say
Before I let you get away, yeah
I said, are you gonna be my girl?

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Come on

I could see you home with me
But you were with another man, yeah
I know we ain't got much to say
Before I let you get away, yeah
Uh, be my girl
Be my girl
Are you gonna be my girl?
Yeah!16Embed
