Come Around Again LyricsYeah I’m waitin’ for you, it’s been so long
Yeah I’m waitin’ for you, it’s been so long
Yeah I’m sad when I’m on my own
They said it takes a long long time
If it’s not too much
Could you hear me now
You promised me you’d always be
When I wake up please come around again
Come around again
You promised me you’d always be
When I wake up please come around again
Come around again yeah
Yeah I’m waitin’ for you, it’s been so long
Yeah I’m sad when I’m all alone
They said it takes a long long time
If it’s not too much
Could you hear me now
You promise me you’d always be
When I wake up please come around again
Come around again
You promised me you’d always be
When I wake up please come around again
Come around again
Yeah there’s something I was thinking about
Get it out of my head
Yeah there’s something I was kicking around
Somethin’ you said
I don’t know when I’m right
I only know when I’m wrong
When you gonna leave some light to show it all
And keep the lights from going off
Coz I don’t see
Yeah I’m waitin’ for you, it’s been so long
Yeah I’m lost but I’m at home
They said it takes a long long time
If it’s not too much
Could you hear me now
Come around again
Come around again
Please come around againEmbed
