Into the Galaxy Lyrics
Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy
Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy

An apparition of twilight visions
A final mission of superstition
Reactivated, now automated
Appropriated, investigated
Global tectonics, psycho robotic
Plasma bionic, bred supersonic
A new translation for integration
Your invitation, G.L.O.R.I.A

Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy
Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy
Hyper creation or reinvention
Love and affection, gaining attention
United Nations, interrelations
A declaration of hypertension
Emerging summits, pre-emptive plummet
We drop atomic to shooting comets
The controversial, ultra-commercial
Now universal, G.L.O.R.I.A

Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy
Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy


Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy
Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy2Embed
