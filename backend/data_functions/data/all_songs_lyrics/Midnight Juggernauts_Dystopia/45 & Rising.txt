45 & Rising LyricsThe planet has a secret
They've known this all the while
They're drinking all the water
It's 45 & Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's Rising, Rising
The planet has a secret
They've known this all the while
They're drinking all the water
It's 45 & Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's Rising, Rising
It's Rising, Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's Rising, Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's 45 & Rising
It's Rising, RisingEmbed
