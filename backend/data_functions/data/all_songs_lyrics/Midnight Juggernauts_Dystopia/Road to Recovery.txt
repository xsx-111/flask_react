Road to Recovery LyricsStars in the sky they will guide you back home
Float as the night forms a path of its own
Follow the lights they will guide you back home
x3
Path to discovery
Road to recovery
Laugh as we run from the world we once knew
Songs we once sung they will come back to you
Aim for the sun as it comes into view
x5
Path to discovery
