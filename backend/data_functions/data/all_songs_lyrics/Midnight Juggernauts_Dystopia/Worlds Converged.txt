Worlds Converged LyricsTime
Time it ticks on by
Signposts through our life
Lifts us up on high
And dream again
Dreams
Dreams are all i know
Dreams they com they go
Seldom they come true
They did with you
That day
Our fate was set
That day
Thank God we met
That day
Our worlds converged by will
The day the earth stood stillEmbed
