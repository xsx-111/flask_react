Nine Lives LyricsI've lived nine lives, i've lived them well
I've carved my crash course straight through hell
I've broken bones, i've had my spills
It fuels my cyclone heart so
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Straight through the sun
Straight through...
Straight through the sun
Straight through...
Straight through the sun
Straight through...
Straight through the sun
Straight through...
This world don't mean a thing to me
Without those songs you sing to me
Those feline eyes are all I see
It fuels my cyclone heart so
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it comingEmbed
