Aurora LyricsHideaway
Find a way
To hide away
Turn the page
Or fade away
All we need
Finally
Will come to me
Dawn will rise
Eventually
Oh, sun
Shines its light
On the streets again
As the day
Burns its way
Back to life
Searching for
Something more
A brighter day
Broken dreams
Are washed away
Signs of life
Stars up high
Drift troughout the night
Time stands still
But years pass by
Oh, sun
Shines its light
On the streets again
As the day
Burns its way
Back to life
Sun
Circles up high again
Sun
Lights up the skies again
Here we come
Flags wil fly again
So we run
Through the fires againEmbed
