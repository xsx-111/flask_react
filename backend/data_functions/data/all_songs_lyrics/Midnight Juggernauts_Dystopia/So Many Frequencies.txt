So Many Frequencies LyricsSo many frequencies, such little bass
So many vacancies, such little space
So many destinies, such little hope
So many enemies, such little rope
So many fireflies, such little light
So many battlecries, such little fight
So many chromosomes, such little heart
So many milestones
So many, so many
Somewhere out there
I'll find my home
Somewhere out there
I'll find my home
So many lotteries, such little breath
So many offerings, such little left
So many mysteries, such little known
So many harvested, such little grown
So many heiraches, such little height
So many rivalries, such little bite
So many falasies, such little played
So many galaxies
So many, so many
Somewhere out there
I'll find my home
Somewhere out there
I'll find my homeEmbed
