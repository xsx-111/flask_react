Shadows Lyrics
They'll be hiding in the shadows
They'll be hiding in the dark of the night
They'll be hiding 'til tomorrow
They'll be hiding 'til the timing is right
It's an answer for the future
It's a question that we left in the past
It's a message for the masses
It's a problem but it ain't gonna last

Oooooo..you will give to me
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow today
Oooooo..you will give to me
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow today

It's a passing of a legend
It's a passing of an age of pretend
It's a story that we beckon
It's a story and it ain't gonna end
Until now
Oooooo..you will give to me
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow today
Oooooo..you will give to me
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow today
Oooooo..you will give to me
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow today
Oooooo..you will give to me
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow todayEmbed
