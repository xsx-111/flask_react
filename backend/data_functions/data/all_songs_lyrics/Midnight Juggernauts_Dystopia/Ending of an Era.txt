Ending of an Era LyricsThe city, the hustle
The workers, the muscle
The martyrs, the monkeys
The data, the junkies
The wounded, the tortured
The fallen, the slaughtered
The highways, the wagons
The dungeons, the dragons
The ocean, the salmon
The lifeblood, the famine
The cattle, the karma
The bible, the drama
The princes, the paupers
The daughters, their stalkers
The statement, the warning
The sirens, we set them off
 x4
Sirens
Sound off the sirens
Hell reigns above
The huffing, the puffing
The money for nothing
The winnings, the loses
The burning of the crosses
The passion, the hunger
The lightning, the thunder
The murder, the mirror
The ending of an era
The fortune, the market
The children, the target
The lovers, the fighters
The writers that guide us
The future, the preachers
The teachers that reach us
The statement, the warning
The sirens, we set them off
 x8
Sirens
Sound off the sirens
Hell reigns above
Sirens....x4Embed
