Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond) Lyrics
Uh-hoo!

It's a sunshine life for me
If I could get away from this cloud over me
Seems to just follow me around
It's a sunshine life for me
If I could get away from this cloud over me
Seems to just follow me around

There's a good life had for free
When you're out in the country
That's what I could use
If I could get away there soon

It's a sunshine life for me
If I could get away from this cloud over me
Seems to just follow me around

There's a good life had at sea
If you're not in the navy
That's the life for you
Sail away, Raymond, sail away
Ho!Ah!
Now most folks just bore me
Always imposing
And I'd rather meet a tree
Somewhere out in the cornfield

And it's a sunshine


And it's a sunshine
I said, sunshine
It's a sunshine
Ha! Ha! Ha! Hoo!Embed
