Photograph Lyrics
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more

I thought I'd make it
The day you went away
But I can't make it
'Til you come home again to stay-yi-yay-yi-yay

I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by and we grow old and grey

Now you're expecting me
To live without you
But that's not something
That I'm looking forward to

I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by and we grow old and grey
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more

Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more

Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more3Embed
