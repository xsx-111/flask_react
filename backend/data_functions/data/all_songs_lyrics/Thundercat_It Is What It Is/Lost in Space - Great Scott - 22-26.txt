Lost in Space / Great Scott / 22-26 LyricsHi, hello
Is anybody there?
Let me know if you can hear me
It feels so cold and so alone
Just need some sort of sun
And I know, I know, I know
We're not alone
But it's hard to tell
Just let me know
So I can go
Because I can feel a pulse
Breathe, please breathe
Breathe for me
Breathe for me
Is it time to go?
Go and start the show
Somewhere lost in space1Embed
