It Is What It Is Lyrics

When the gold becomes dough and the magic starts to fade
When it all comes to an end
When there's nothing left to say
It is what it is
I tried to make it work
My best just wasn't enough
It couldn't be helped, the end
The things I would do for you

After all is said and done
And I'm all alone
When I sit back and reflect
From a broken heart
Sometimes there's regret
It is what it is
It couldn't be helped, the end
So many things I wanna say
This is the end


Hey, Mac (Woah)
