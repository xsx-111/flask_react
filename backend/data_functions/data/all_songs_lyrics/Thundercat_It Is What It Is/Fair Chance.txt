Fair Chance Lyrics
I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
Even though you're not around (You're not around)
So hard to get over it
I've tried to get under it
Stuck in between, it is what it is (Is what it is)
Bye-bye for now
I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
You'd do it for me, you'd do it for me (It is what it is)
'Til it ain't
Things will never be the same
Never be the same again
Everything so strange (Strange)
It ain't a game no more (A game no more, woah)
We were just gettin' lifted
Yesterday, yesterday
Now we just reminiscin'
On yesterday, yesterday
Keep my head above water (Head above water)
My eyes gettin' bigger (Eyes gettin' bigger), the world gettin' smaller
I been gettin' richer, only made me crazy (Crazy)
Mama said I'm different (Oh yeah), since I was a baby (Baby)

My emotions
Gimme a sip of that potion
No, my heart is not broken
But I feel like it's open
Please, somebody, do surgery
Tell the doctor come work with me
I keep lookin' at my soul
Prayin', but only God knows
And I've been workin' nine to nine
Yeah
But they talk about it
But you know it's all fine (All fine)
But who can say that?
I would be the man of your dreams
I will do all that I can
And be all I can be
I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
Even though you're not around (You're not around)
So hard to get over it
I've tried to get under it
Stuck in between, it is what it is (Is what it is)
Bye-bye for now
I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
You'd do it for me, you'd do it for me8Embed
