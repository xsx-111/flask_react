Overseas Lyrics
Girl, you're so fly (So fly)
You really blow my mind (My mind)
Let's not waste any more time
I'll just meet you overseas
We can do it on the plane
I just wanna be with you
I wanna meet you in Brazil
Take you to a place that you never been before
We can just lay on the beach
And just fall asleep, or maybe meet up in Japan
Maybe we can just hold hands
Let's go get drunk in Golden Gai
Maybe meet up in Russia
Meet up in Russia
I don't really care who sees
Let's join the mile high club

Ladies and gentlemen, this is, uh, your captain speaking
Gonna ask that, uh, on our descent here into Moscow
Everybody, please put your seatbelts on
Winds are gettin' a little bit choppy and
There appears to be a shiny black man up there in first class
Gettin' some sloppy-toppy, hahaha
He's got all his chains on and a durag
Is that Thundercat?
What's up, brother?Embed
