I Love Louis Cole Lyrics
Let me say, "Good morning", my friend
About last night, I don't know how it ended
I can't find my phone and I can't find my shoes
But nothing beats being in a party with you

Let's do it all again
Let's do it again
Let's do it all again
Let's do it again

It's just more fun when you come around
Even if I act up
You let me know that I'm not crazy
Crazy
Crazy

Yeah, I remember you were punching my friends
Made an oil spill that makes Exxon offended
Then you fell asleep on the laundry in my room
And this is why I love to party with you

Let's do it all again
Let's do it again
Let's do it all again
Let's do it again

When you're around, you know what to say
You brighten my day
I feel that it's crazy
When you're around
When you're around3Embed
