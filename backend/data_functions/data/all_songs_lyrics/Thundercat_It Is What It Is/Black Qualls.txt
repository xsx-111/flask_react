Black Qualls Lyrics
I just bought a crib on top of the hill
And I bought a brand new ride, am I keepin' it real?
There's nothin' wrong if you got it
I'm not livin' in fear, I'm just bein' honest

'Cause there's no more livin' in fear
No more livin' in fear
If we don't talk about it, then who will?

I know I give a different vibe, yeah (Then who will?)
I'm doin' what I like, woah, woah, woah (Then who will?)
I don't need your co-sign (Who will?)
'Cause I'm young enough and I'm old enough, both at the same time (Who will?)
Hey, don't trip on my aggression, baby, oh (Who will?)
'Cause I can go in different directions, baby (Who will?)
I'm just tryna live my life, do my best and that's alright (Who will?)
Yes, I'm comfortable and that's what's tight (Who will?)

Just moved out the hood, doesn't mean I'm doin' it good
Wanna post this on the 'Gram, but don't think I should
Is it just for me or am I paranoid?
Gotta keep it on the low 'cause I been robbed before
Sometime I wanna say that I'm blessed (Baby)
Black man's grind gon' answer the test, ah
The box you tried to throw me in don't fit me no more, no
Creative spirit talkin', creative spirit walkin'
And I ain't tryna hurt nobody, hurt nobody, hurt nobody

'Cause there's no more livin' in fear
No more livin' in fear
If we don't talk about it, then who will?

We don't talk, then we feel safe
Each one of us with tiny, tiny, tiny screens
I've been runnin', I've been runnin' like a soul, woo
Sweatin' on 'em, now the beat gon' breathe
But I keep hearin'
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop (Tell you what)
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop (Can't even imagine)
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop (Whatever I feel is real)
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, yeah, ayy, hey (It does not matter, I mean it)Embed
