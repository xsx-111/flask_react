King of the Hill Lyrics
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

You say you ain't got time for games
No more games
But the world got time for games with you
Play your own
Playing with your money and your heart
Just admit you don't know what to do
I've seen a lot of things come and go
Lots of pimps and tons of hoes
How this ends, we'll never know

A king in his castle
A king of the hill
Wasting his time
Chasing cheap thrills
He knows it's gonna cost him
God knows how much

But you know you gotta pay to play (Pay to play)
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)
Playing with your money and your heart
There's got to be another way
A king in his castle
A king of the hill
Wasting his time
Chasing cheap thrills
He knows it's gonna cost him
God knows how much

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love1Embed
