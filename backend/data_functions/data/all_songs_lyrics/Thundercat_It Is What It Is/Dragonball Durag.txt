Dragonball Durag Lyrics
I feel kinda fly standin' next to you
Baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Would you tell me the truth?
Stay with me and love me through the night, endlessly
I'ma keep on all my chains when I'm makin' love to you
Hold me close and let me squeeze you tight through the night
But, baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Would you tell me the truth?

Do you like my new whip?
Watch me go zoom, zoom
Baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Would you tell me the truth? (Lie to me?)
Stay with me and love me through the night, endlessly
I just wanna know how you feel
Tell me, am I doin' it right?

I may be covered in cat hair, but I still smell good
Baby, let me know, how do I look in my durag?
Don't lie to me, let me rock you all night long
I'm tryna impress you, girl
Let me know, how do I look in my durag?
I'm tryna get intimate
Let me love you like you never been before, baby (Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ooh-ooh)
You don't have to like my video games or my comic books
But, baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Did I tie it right?
Did you wear that dress just for me?
'Cause I'm tryna smash
Baby girl, I'ma smash in my durag
'Cause it's only right

Do you like the way my ice drips in the light?
Baby girl, do you like me in my durag?
Let me know
Would you let me know?
Let me know, girl
Let's make love until we fall asleep
I like the way you feel next to me
Baby, you look so good in this moonlight
Stay with me and love me through the night, baby
Let's make love until we fall asleep17Embed
