From Beyond LyricsChoir of the sun chants inside the anti moon
Shockwaves rattle the Earth below with hymn of doom
Chilled rays freeze below the eye of silver sun
Damned souls gather in valley of the evil one
Phantasmal specter of two worlds collide
Planetoid soaked in rays of electric light
Stoner caravan from deep space arrives
Flies on the suncraft toward the glowing eye
Phantasmal specter of two worlds collide
Planetoid soaked in rays of electric light
Stoner caravan from deep space arrives
Flies on the suncraft toward the glowing eye
Walk with the cleric under eye of silver sun
Damned souls gather in valley of the evil one
Choir of the sun chants inside the anti moon
Shockwaves rattle the Earth below with hymn of doomEmbed
