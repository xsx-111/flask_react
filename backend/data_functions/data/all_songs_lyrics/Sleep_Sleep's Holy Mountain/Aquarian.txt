Aquarian LyricsTrapped inside a world under leagues of ocean
The clergy arrives with the magic potion
I put my mouth into the cup of potion
Sip down the nectar and escape the ocean
Reaching for the sun, leave Atlantis, escape the sea
Fly into the sky, leave behind Atlantean key
Reaching for the sun, leave Atlantis, escape the sea
Fly into the sky, leave behind Atlantean key
Escape the sea with ascending motion
I touch the sun and return to oceanEmbed
