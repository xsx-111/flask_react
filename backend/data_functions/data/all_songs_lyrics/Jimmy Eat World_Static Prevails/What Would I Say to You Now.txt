What Would I Say to You Now LyricsStill sitting there with your legs crossed
Not paying attention to me
If we talk, just curious, would this end up like it always does?
All the wrong I've done
All the wrong I'll do
Keeps me from trying
It keeps me quiet
Throw out your arms to each side
It's easier to let things go
When we talk think what we say: there's questions then silence and
In silence we remain
All the wrong I've done and all the wrong I'll do
It keeps me from trying
Keeps me from calling you
Something I just found out
Something you know by now
Hope makes you so strong
Strength keeps you alone and far awayEmbed
