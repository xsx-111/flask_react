Rockstar LyricsWhere you're hiding, the shine off the wall
Stop giving it up now because you're going to find yourself a mastermind in time
Rock star, what's mine is yours
Rock star, you're looking good
You're looking to find a fight
I'm the stranger here you know
Can't you understand that things always work out my way today
Rock star, what's mine is yours
Rock star, you're looking good
You're looking to find a fight
Rock star. Rock star
Get off my battlefield
You could not take it back from me
It's all the way up top
Cannot take a longer way
Get off my battlefield
Could not take it back from you
It's all the way up top
Cannot take a longer way
That's all
It's all
Can't fall Away
