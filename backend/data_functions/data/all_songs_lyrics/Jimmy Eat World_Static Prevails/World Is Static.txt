World Is Static LyricsThe longest time away
Last time, the friends we made
Longest time away
Best friend's too cheap to stay
Of course I'll go with you
Not every day I get to
Of course I'll stay with you
How often?
Pictures tell so much
They remind me often
Your voice brings back so much
Situations
Between the money and your every move, acceptance
Between the money and your every move
(We both know things never change)
Between the money and your every move, acceptance
(We both know static prevails)
Between the money and your every move
The longest time away
The longest time away
The longest time away
My friend
Pictures tell so much
They remind me often
Your voice brings back so much
Situations
Between the money and your every move, acceptance
Between the money and your every move
(Take a seat at your request)
Between the money and your every move, acceptance
(Five years, I'm still there)
Between the money and your every move
Between the money and your every move, acceptance
(Take a seat at your request)
Between the money and your every move
(Five years, I'm still there)
Between the money and your every move, acceptance
(Take a seat at your request)
Between the money and your every move
(Five years, I'm still there)
