In the Same Room LyricsFingers in
Listen what voices say
Fingers in
Listen what voices say
You always wrote for me, ego
Risk worth taking, risk worth leaving
Seems I'm still afraid of promise
To promise
Too big to stop
Too big to hold down
Trade up for the fast ride
Trade your friends
Time passes us
Don't move
Be still
Be silent
Pulling your teeth, you push away
Cancel plans, cancel them all
Check your breath for cold and hold on
Please hold on
No pictures left to burn goodbye to
The smell of ash and white walls blank
Time passes us
Don't move
Be still
Be silent
Horizontal lines and button-up
Horizontal lines and button-up
Fingers in
Listen what voices say
The drawers of paper all say one thing
Like music boxes custom-made
Time passes us
Don't move
Be still
Be silentEmbed
