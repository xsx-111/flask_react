Robot Factory Lyrics
Falling off this cycle
And it really ticks me off
When you calculate this time and place
Looking over shoulders
Can always be like what it seems
When you were left to my old man

I am why you bred me here
Tear these clothes down when we fight

Back around these towers
Like something you don't wanna see
Like yesterday, when you were found
Adding up misfortunes can always seem like holidays
When you were sent to be the one

I am why you bred me here
Tear these clothes down when we fight

It's over, they found me, they made me
I can't believe they knew it, we blew it
Our fortunes, they've been retrieved
By humans who knew me
They used me to get what's mine
They'll never replace me
I'll be back, I want revenge
It's over, they found me, they beat me
I can't believe they knew it, we blew it
Our fortunes, they've been retrieved
By humans who knew me
They used me to get what's mine
They'll never replace me
I'll be back, I want revenge1Embed
