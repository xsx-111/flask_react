Digits LyricsPay attention
Stop paying for regret
Fossil resources all used up
Make the best use of your time
You could be on to something
Too skeptic, too tired to care
When they all seem to know at once
Sweet muse left me all alone
There's only my weight left
Euthanasia could be the greatest gift
It's all the same
So let me know
It's never changed
So let it go
(Wait outside your house to come back out)
It's all the same
So let it go
It's just what you...
Save the long car ride home
Don't leave your house today
Nothing lost but still nothing gained
No possibilities
All wasted, world gone under
Life means I hear my ears ring one more day
And you will see it through at once
Sweet muse, she won't be around today
Things that I could not say
Are we through yet?
Are you gone yet?
You're on and off
Phase in, phase out
Cross your heart
Crash, burn and fall
Under cushions hide the change
So no one knows
Just be careful who you tell
I really want to care when you say, "I'll change that."
I just don't feel a thing when you say, "We'll get there, someday."Embed
