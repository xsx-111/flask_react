Seventeen Lyrics
Hung up here on a web of comfort
Taking off with nowhere to go
Standing tall with your new cloak armor
Making out like it's all been done

It's harder than it seems
You slip but never fall

They'll take you, where you won't come back to me
They'll take you, where you won't come back to me

Tearing down what we built up so well
Laying low as you came my way
Look alive with your head on backwards
Going off when there's nothing wrong

It's only in your dreams
But it felt like it was real

They'll take you, where you won't come back to me
They'll take you, where you won't come back to me
Hang loose, my friend
Don't walk away from me
'Cause I really think you're cool
Is it worth turning back despite these open hands?
You're tearing me apart

They'll take you, where you won't come back to me
They'll take you, where you won't come back to me
They'll take you, where you won't come back to me
(You need to find yourself)
They'll take you, where you won't come back to me
(You need to find yourself)Embed
