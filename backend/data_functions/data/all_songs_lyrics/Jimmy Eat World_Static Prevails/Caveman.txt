Caveman LyricsA monster lives in your backyard
The 2x4's are making their way around
The big get bigger when the fight's done
I found that secret door
A man with a shovel's going to dig deep down
To find out where it feeds
A house
A catalogue full of nothing good
The white house ponders no remorse
The big get bigger when the fight's done
I found that secret door
A man with a shovel's going to dig deep down
To find out where it feeds
A house
It seems like a drag to be torn apart by unexpected hands
It's in your name
It's in your face
I'm wrong againEmbed
