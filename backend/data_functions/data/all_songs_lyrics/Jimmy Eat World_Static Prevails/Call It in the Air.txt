Call It in the Air Lyrics
Leave home today
Escape your region
It's in your head
Keep moving on

Choose starlight, no way to retrace
(No way to retrace all your good days, add them up)
It is gone
Choose star bright, no way to retrace
(None of you knew any more than who's in here)
It is gone

Become your dad
Live unquestioned
It's in your head
Nostalgia's dead

Choose starlight, no way to retrace
(No way to retrace all your good days, add them up)
It is gone
Choose star bright, no way to retrace
(None of you knew any more than who's in here)
It is gone

Starlight, star bright
Starlight, star bright

Can't depend on honest answers from dependent hands
Won't accept an honest answer from an open hand
Can't depend on honest answers from dependent hands
(Say the words and I sign off)
Won't accept an honest answer from an open hand
(Say the words and I sign off)

Starlight, star bright
Starlight, star brightEmbed
