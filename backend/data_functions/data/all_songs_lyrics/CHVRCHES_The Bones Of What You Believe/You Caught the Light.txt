You Caught the Light Lyrics
I hear you when you call
There's a sign for her and everyone
And go on, but not with me
And let it all fall down
Let it all fall down

Sky is light
You caught the light
You carried mine
You caught the light

They said that you would call
And take it all, it's history
And we'll laugh until the end
Let the rain come down
Let it all come down

Sky is light
(I have nothing but love for)
You caught the light
(The places that call me home)
You carried mine
(I have nothing but love for)
You caught the light
(The places that call me home)
Sky is light
(I have nothing but love for)
You caught the light
(The places that call me home)
You carried mine
(I have nothing but love for)
You caught the light
(The places that call me home)1Embed
