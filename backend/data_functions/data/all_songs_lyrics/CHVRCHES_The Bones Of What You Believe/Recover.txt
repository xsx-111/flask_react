Recover Lyrics
The last one was a bit tuney

Caught out, cold
Hiding from you in a skin so old
I'll come clean
Everyone, everyone knows it's me

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour
I've got the answer
Open the envelope

I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me
Blow by blow
Honest in every way I know
You appear
To face the decision I know you fear

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour
I've got the answer
Open the envelope

I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me
And you know you don't need me

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour
I've got the answer
Open the envelope

I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me27Embed
