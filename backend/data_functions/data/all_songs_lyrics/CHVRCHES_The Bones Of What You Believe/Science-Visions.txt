Science/Visions Lyrics
Breathe, don't speak
It's leaving your body now
Slow heart, set free
A circuit of consciousness
When you are truly yourself
You will succumb to a permanence
A light, by day
A shadow resides by night

I, I
Hear, hear
Your, your
Breathing
I, I
Feel, feel
You, you
Leaving

With understanding
You won't let it cast you down
A mind full of questions
A current to purify
Science and visions
Be near when I call your name
Or ask me a question
I, I
Hear, hear
Your, your
Breathing

Breathe, don't speak
It's leaving your body now

I, I
Feel, feel
You, you
Leaving

Heart set free
A circuit of consciousness

I, I
Hear, hear
Your, your
Breathing
Light by day
A shadow resides by night

I, I
Feel, feel
You, you
Leaving

With understanding
You won't let it cast you down
A mind full of questions
A current to purify
Science and Visions
Be near when I call your name
A mind full of questions
A current to purify
Science and vision
Be near when I call your name
Or ask me a question3Embed
