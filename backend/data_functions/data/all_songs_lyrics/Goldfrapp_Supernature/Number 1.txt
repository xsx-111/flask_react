Number 1 Lyrics
Walk out into velvet
Nothing more to say
You're my favourite moment
You're my Saturday

'Cause you're my number one
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sunset only seconds
Just ripe, then it's gone
Got no new intentions
Just right, then it's gone

'Cause you're my number one
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll be there to meet you
Getting down to greet you

Walk out into velvet
Nothing more to say
You're my favourite moment
You're my Saturday

'Cause you're my number one
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause you're my number one
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Howl under the moon
Howl under the moon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Howl under the moon
Howl under the moon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Howl under the moon1Embed
