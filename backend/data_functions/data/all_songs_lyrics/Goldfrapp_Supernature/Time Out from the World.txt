Time Out from the World Lyrics
Breathing in your sip of gold
I follow all your little lines
I like to watch a thousand times
I want to feel you here

I like to watch a thousand times
I make a shrine for you

Time out from the world
Leaving it all just for a day
But you love this town
Hold me now, take us a day

Here I go, I'm going back
On every word you ever said
I'm dreaming of another time
Yesterday my alibi

We changed the world, just you and I
I make a shrine for you
Time out from the world
Leaving it all just for a day
But you love this town
Hold me now, take us a dayEmbed
