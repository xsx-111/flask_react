Koko Lyrics
Sharp as teeth and stars
I can't give you up
Like a moth to light
Move like caramel

'Til dawn, you glow
'Til dawn, you glow

Soon be nothing of this world
Soon be nothing
Soon be nothing of this world
Soon be nothing

Breathe back into life
Stabs at happiness
Now we're having fun
Hold tight

Don't look down
'Til dawn, you glow
'Til dawn, you glow
Soon be nothing of this world
Soon be nothing
Soon be nothing of this world
Soon be nothing

Don't look down
'Til dawn, you glow
'Til dawn, you glowEmbed
