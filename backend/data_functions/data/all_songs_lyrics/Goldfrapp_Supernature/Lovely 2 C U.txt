Lovely 2 C U Lyrics
Lo-lovely to see you
Lo-lovely to see you

A wonderful place to be
The birds are singing
The dreams that are sent to me
Everyone's waving
But there's no noises
The smell of your skin
The glittering lights of hell
I'm missing sin

Lo-lovely to see you
Lo-lovely to see you

I wanna get out of here
Inhale your sky
A beautiful place to be
So I don't know why
They're selling us something
I don't need
They're selling us something, babe
You shouldn't believe
Lo-lovely to see you
Lo-lovely to see you
Lo-lovely to see you
Lo-lovely to see you

Lo-lovely to see you
Lo-lovely to see you
Lo-lovely to see you
Lo-lovely to see you
Lo-lovely to see you
Lo-lovely to see youEmbed
