You Never Know Lyrics
How long now?
How long now?

I love you
Steel painted eyes
Feels like snow
Change my head days so long

You never know, you never know, you never know
You never know, you never know, you never know
Just how long it will be

Here we go again
We're going round and round
Here we go again
We're going round and round

Today I know
It's too long dare we'll see
Feels like snow
Chained myself to me
You never know, you never know, you never know
You never know, you never know, you never know
Just how long it will be

Here we go again
We're going round and round
Here we go again
We're going round and round

How long now, longest story, how long now?
How long now, longest story, how long now?
Longest story, longest story
How long now, longest story, how long now?
Longest story, how long now?Embed
