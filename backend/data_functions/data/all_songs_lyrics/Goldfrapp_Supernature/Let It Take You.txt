Let It Take You Lyrics
They sail light, ocean
Sail this night, ocean
Sail at light day, sail here
Filling my sleep so gently

Just let it take you
Oh, let it steer
Just let it take you

They sail light, ocean
Sail this night, ocean
Shimmer like gold, they're singing
Filling my sleep so gently

Just let it take you
Just let it take you
Oh, let it steer
Just let it take you
Just let it take you
Oh, this is easy

Just let it take you
Just let it take you
Oh, let it steer
Just let it take you
Just let it take you
Oh, this is easy
