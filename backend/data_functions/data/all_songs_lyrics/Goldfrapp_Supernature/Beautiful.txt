Beautiful Lyrics
Magic maker, wish me one wish
Hold me to your light and maybe
Oh, what if I say
Why don't we play
I wear your star

I shiver, you shake it
Turn me on, I can't help it
Don't know, am I dreaming
Or have you, you haven't
Stop for awhile
Why don't we play
I wear your star

Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted beautiful
Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted critical

Turn me onto your star, show me
One night, slowly aching, make me
Oh, what if I say
Why don't we play
I wear your star
I'm going right under
Your spell has taken over
I'm feeling, your passion
Oh there's no need for
The place where I'll wait
Why don't we play
I wear your star

Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted beautiful
Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted critical

Turn me onto your star show me
One night, slowly aching, make me
Oh, what if I say
Why don't we play
I wear your star

Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted beautiful
Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted criticalEmbed
