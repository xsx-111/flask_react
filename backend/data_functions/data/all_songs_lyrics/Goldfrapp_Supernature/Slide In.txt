Slide In Lyrics
You send me just colours
I'm waiting, don't hold back

Trees bow to the wind and
I'm falling inside you

Slide in, feel the future
Rushing slowly, right now

So close I could touch it
I'm dreaming, don't wake up

Slide in, feel the future
Rushing slowly, right now
Nothing makes me feel like
Show me real love, right now

You send me just colours
You send me just colours
Slide in, feel the future
Rushing slowly, right now
Nothing makes me feel like
Show me real love, right nowEmbed
