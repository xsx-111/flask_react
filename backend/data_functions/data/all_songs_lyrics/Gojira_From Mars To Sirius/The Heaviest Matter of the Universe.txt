The Heaviest Matter of the Universe Lyrics
Lay down, fall away

Lie awake
Just cannot move my arms and legs, I'm paralyzed
Don't recall how to free myself from this
Heart of the dark, my face contorted
Don't know how to reach the light
But I feel so bad like a freak in a cage

Open the door
Enter your heart
You go so far

Golden unworldly silence
Spaceflight at speed of light
I cross the clouds and colours
The black hole is calling me
Slide on the horizon
On the frontier not to cross
Black dwarf, time's gone distorted
Heart of the dark, a whirl of light
Enter in the realm of nothingness
I feel the cold, my eyes are shut, my fear is slowly dying
Light years from here are my thoughts and cages
I can hear their moan, but now a long deep breath is calling

Overtaking time and now understanding space
I feel united, I do cross light, feel the living
Here in the centre stands the light of love
That never can be touched from greater silence shall return7Embed
