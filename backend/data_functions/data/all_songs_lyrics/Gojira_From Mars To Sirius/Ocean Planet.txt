Ocean Planet Lyrics
Go

I'm in a mental cage, I'm locked up
Imprisoned, I live deathlike, sickening
Strong is your hold on my resignation
I, don't see the stars, my memories are veiled

In fluid dreams, I fall, I'm restless
Walls made of stone are turned into water now
Enlightened demons take by the hand
Approaching me, this great eye speaking

Mountainous waves are breaking on my despair
Awaken me, but I'm still dreaming
And I just plunge into this sea of light
Set open the doors of soul I'm living

Lightning struck me
I see the path I was so scared of
And fly to the stars
Conviction now increasing at last
My skin is broken
I see the smallest part of me now
My mind is alive
But I'll never bow to this again
Why do they call me there?
How can I fly?
All this water, I...
I don't feel like I could ever swim to them
Whales in the sky
I feel they're so close inside and yet so far away

Burst into tears, I feel sad, my dreams aflame
The force is now away
Lie on a stone, drop this load and cry to see
The ocean planet is on burn1Embed
