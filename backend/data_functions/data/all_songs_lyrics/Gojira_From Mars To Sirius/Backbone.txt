Backbone Lyrics
Indestructible
On this rock, I lie, but I'm alive for good
And I just free myself for now from all what was wrong
Break the unbreakable

All the stars fearlessly bright
They call me out there, order me to face the wind
My structure's alive, body's on the way
Don't bow down before the walls
Of fear and madness, they try to counter me
And strike me down to the ground again

Inexhaustible
The strength of fire is running through me
Spine-like beam of light
What mortal could ever break this force?
Unconstrained
I see at last my backbone straighten
Thy serpent made of bones
Finally rise up from the ground awaken

Beat your feet on the ground now, go3Embed
