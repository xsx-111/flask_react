Rock-A-Hula Baby LyricsRock-a-hula, rock rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rah

The way she moves her hips up to her fingertips
I feel I'm heaven bound
And when she starts to sway, I've gotta say
She really moves the grass around

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine

Although I love to kiss my little hula miss
I never get the chance
I wanna hold her tight all through the night
But all she wants to do is dance

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock, rock, rock, rock

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine
Oh that Rock-a-hula baby of mineEmbed
