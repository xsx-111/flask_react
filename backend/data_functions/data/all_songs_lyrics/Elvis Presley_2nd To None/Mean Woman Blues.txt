Mean Woman Blues Lyrics
I got a woman, mean as she can be
I got a woman, mean as she can be
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me

A black cat up and died of fright
'Cause she crossed his path last night
I got a woman, mean as she can be
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me

Kissed so hard, she bruise my lips
Hurts so good, my heart just flips
I got a woman, mean as she can be
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me


Strangest gal I ever had
Never happy unless she's mad
I got a woman, mean as she can be
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me
Yeah, huh
Yeah
She makes love without a smile
Ooh, hot dog, it drives me wild
I got a woman, mean as she can be
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me1Embed
