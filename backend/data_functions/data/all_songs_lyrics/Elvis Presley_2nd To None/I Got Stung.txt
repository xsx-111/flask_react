I Got Stung Lyrics
Holy smoke
Land sakes alive!
I never thought this could happen to me
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah

I got stung by a sweet honey bee
Oh, what a feeling come over me
It started in my eyes
Crept up to my head
Flew to my heart
'Til I was stung dead
I'm done, uh-uh
I got stung
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah

She had all that I wanted and more
And I've seen honey bees before
She started buzzing in my ear
Buzzing in my brain
Got stung all over
But I feel no pain
I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung
Now don't think I'm complaining
I'm mighty pleased we met
But you give one little peck
On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold, cold sweat

Well, if I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzing around your hive
Every day at five
And I'm never going to leave once I arrive
Because I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah

Now don't think I'm complaining
I'm mighty pleased we met
But you give me one little peck
On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold, cold sweat
Well, if I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzing around your hive
Every day at five
And I'm never going to leave once I arrive
Because I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeahEmbed
