Grazed Knees LyricsI'm trying not to stare, it's too late
The blanket's over there, if you like
I'm broken and I'm colder than hell
I should've said I'd not come back here
Your breakfast will get cold
I really have to go
It's easier to lie and be safe
Time and time again I'm half stalled
One giant leap of faith is easy
When everyone you ask is so sure
Just give a second thought
What if we don't get caught
Just say you love me now
And forget this whole row
Just save your energy
For making up with meEmbed
