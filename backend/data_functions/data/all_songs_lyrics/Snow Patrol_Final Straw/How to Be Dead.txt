How to Be Dead LyricsPlease don't go crazy if I tell you the truth
No, you don't know what happened and you never will
If you don't listen to me while I talk to the wall
This blanket is freezing, it's been out in the hall
Where you've had me for hours 'til I'm sure what I want
But darling, I want the same thing that I wanted before
So sweetheart, tell me what's up, I won't stop
No way
Please keep your hands down, and stop raising your voice
It's hardly what I'd be doing if you gave me a choice
It's a simple suggestion, can you give me some time?
So just say yes or no, why can't you shoulder the blame?
Cause both my shoulders are heavy from the weight of us both
You're a big boy now, so let's not talk about growth
You've not heard a single word I have said...
Oh, my god
Please take it easy it can't all be my fault
I haven't made half the mistakes that you've listed so far
Baby, let me explain something, it's all down to drugs
At least I remember taking them and not a lot else
It seems I've stepped over lines you've drawn again and again
But if the ecstasy's in, the wit is definitely out
Dr. Jekyll is wrestlin' Hyde for my pride1Embed
