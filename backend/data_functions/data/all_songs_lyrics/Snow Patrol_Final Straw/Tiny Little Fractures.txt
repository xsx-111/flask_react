Tiny Little Fractures LyricsIs there a place I can go?
Is there a way to get me there?
If I've forgotten what to say
It's because all words are dust
If this is really what you think
How come you won't look me in the eye?
All this crying in your sleep
As I lie awake beside
Whoa, whoa, whoa yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa yeah
Is there a t-shirt I can wear?
Cause I'm soaking
Look at me
What do you mean I don't love you?
I am standing here aren't I?
Maybe you thought of it first
Maybe I get all the praise
Is there a place I can go?
Is there a way to get me there?
Whoa, whoa, whoa yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa yeahEmbed
