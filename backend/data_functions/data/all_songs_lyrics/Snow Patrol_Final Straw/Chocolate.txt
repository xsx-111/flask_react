Chocolate LyricsThis could be the very minute
I'm aware I'm alive
All these places feel like home
With a name I'd never chosen
I can make my first steps
As a child of 25
This is the straw
Final straw in the
Roof of my mouth
As I lie to you
Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it at the time
You're the only thing that I love
Scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer
Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
But in truth, I'm lost for words
What have I done?
It's too late for that
What have I become?
Truth is nothing yet
A simple mistake starts the hardest time
I promise I'll do anything you ask
This timeEmbed
