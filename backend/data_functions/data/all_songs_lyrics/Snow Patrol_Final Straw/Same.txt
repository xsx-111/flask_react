Same LyricsMaybe somewhere else will not be half as cold as me
The curtains drawn, the winter sun makes patterns on your face
It looks like some kaleidoscopic breathing exercise
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
Baby, won't you breathe?
Baby, won't you breathe?
Hold me in your freezing arms before we have to go
I wince a little, but it's not because I know the truth
The windshield of your little car is frosted through the glass
A clear heart of air appears as we shiver on the seats
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
Treat it as a test
Treat it as a test
Baby, won't you breathe?
Baby, won't you breathe?
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
It's the same, it's the same, it's the sameEmbed
