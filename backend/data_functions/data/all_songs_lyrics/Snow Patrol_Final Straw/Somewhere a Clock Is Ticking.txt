Somewhere a Clock Is Ticking Lyrics

I've got this feeling that there's something that I missed
(I could do almost anything to you)
Don't you breathe, don't you breathe
(I could do almost anything to you)
Something happened that I never understood
(I could do almost anything to you)
You can't leave, you can't leave
(I could do almost anything to you)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

Every second, drippin' off my fingertips
(I could do almost anything to you)
Wage your war, wage your war
(I could do almost anything to you)
Another soldier says he's not afraid to die
(I could do almost anything to you)
I am scared, I'm so scared
(I could do almost anything to you)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
In slow motion, the blast is beautiful
(I could do almost anything to you)
Doors slam shut, doors slam shut
(I could do almost anything to you)
A clock is tickin', but it's hidden far away
(I could do almost anything to you)
Safe and sound (S-S-S-Safe)
Safe and sound (S-S-S-Safe)

Ahh, ahh (I could do almost anything to you)
Ahh, ahh (I could do almost anything to you)
Ahh (I could do almost anything to you)
Ahh (I could do almost anything to you)
Ahh (I could do almost anything to you)
Ahh (I could do almost anything to you)
