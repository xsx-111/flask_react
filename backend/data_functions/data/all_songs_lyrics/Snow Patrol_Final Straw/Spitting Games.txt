Spitting Games Lyrics
I broke into your house last night
And left a note at your bedside
I'm far too shy to speak to you at school
You leave me numb, and I'm not sure why

I find it easier to sit and stare
Than push my limbs out towards you right there
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies

I struggle for the words and then give up
My head's up with the birds in the t-hut
A little peace of mind that I know better
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters

But after that the floodgates opened up
And I fell in love with everyone I saw
Please take your time, I'm not in any rush
And it's in everything I ever write

It's not as if I need the extra weight
Confused enough by life, so thanks a lot
Lonely written words for company
Just raise the roof this once and follow me
I struggle for the words and then give up
My head's up with the birds on the T hut
A little peace of mind that I know better
Than the plain disgrace of all my lettersEmbed
