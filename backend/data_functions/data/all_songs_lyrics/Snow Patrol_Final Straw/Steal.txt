Steal LyricsIt's not something, I need, to explain again, I
I won't be caught inside this time
You can't just leave me, having, done the hard work, when I
I don't want anything from here
Stop your stalling and just give me more than you should
Before we're all in the same mess I knew we would
I will not call you 'cos I know he'll answer the phone
There's something stunning about the way we lie 'till it's gone
All I want is one more hour with you, it's all I
Ever wanted out of this
I only did it so I, I would be near you, I have
Never done something like this
Stop your stalling and just give me more than you should
Before we're all in the same mess I knew we would
I will not call you 'cos I know he'll answer the phone
There's something stunning about the way we lie 'till it's goneEmbed
