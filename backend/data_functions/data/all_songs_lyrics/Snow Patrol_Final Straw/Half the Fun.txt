Half the Fun LyricsHalf the fun of it is that I can't keep up
And I lose my breath and what's worse
Is I don't think I'm the first
Any way you like, you can do no wrong
Please just give me five minutes dear
Let's just pray it's not near
Stay forever; I won't last it
I'll die trying
Will you suffer a little with me?
But you would never
With a second chance I'd mess it up again
But I'd do it worse than before
Cos I've learned so much more
About the way we fertilise the roses
That were bought to show us how much you care
Now it's easier to care
Getting past this -- you have to take it
I will wait here
Please believe me, just stop running
Say you'll get help
I caught the last flight, I had to see ya
It can't wait longer
He's not your father, just a doctor
So lick your own woundsEmbed
