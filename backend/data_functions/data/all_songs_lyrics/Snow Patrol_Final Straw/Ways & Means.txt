Ways & Means Lyrics
Getting too busy to make amends
I should try to make it right
Are you ready for the shit to hit?
I think you say you are, but aren't
Doctor, make it better instantly
And you're the only one who can
I've been waiting here my whole damn life
And I've forgotten what I wanted

Maybe I can do it if I put my back into it
I can leave here if I wanted
But there's nowhere else that I can go
Maybe I won't suffer if I find a way to love her
I'd be lying to myself
But there is no way out that I can see

If I lied you'd know it instantly
So I just had to look away
All the honesty I've ever lost
I can't begin to even curse
I never knew the taste of blood 'til now
It's clear I never should've known
Breathing fire was never this much fun
So there's a dark side in us all
Maybe I can do it if I put my back into it
I can leave here if I wanted
But there's nowhere else I can go
Maybe I won't suffer, if I find a way to love her
I'd be lying to myself
But there is no way out that I can seeEmbed
