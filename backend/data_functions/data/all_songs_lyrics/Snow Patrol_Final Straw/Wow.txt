Wow LyricsDon’t be scared of anything at all
Everything we have is all we need
All the spotlights streamin’ into angry skies
It means there’s no one watchin’ as we leave
Say the first thing that comes into your head when you see me
If it looks like it works, and it feels like it works, then it works
With the Sun on your face, all these worries will soon disappear
Just follow me now, just follow me now
I find careful patterns in the snow
It seems you did come around, but changed your mind
If you’d just take ten more steps to me
I won’t ever ask you again
Just because I couldn’t say it doesn’t make me a liar
I noticed a change in the tone of your voice, it’s so clear
My role in this mess is not something that I can be proud of
But it’s all gonna change, yes, it’s all going to change
(All gonna change, yes, it’s all going to change
It’s all gonna change, yes, it’s all going to change)
Say the first thing that comes into your head when you see me
If it looks like it works, and it feels like it works, then it works
With the Sun on your face, all these worries will soon disappear
Just follow me now, just follow me nowEmbed
