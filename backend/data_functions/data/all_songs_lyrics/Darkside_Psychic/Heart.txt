Heart Lyrics
Moonlight sets
Feels like seven years
Since I left
Can’t you see behind this love
Tell me you don’t know
When you don’t like what you see
The dog barks
Bones crunch
There’s a lot of noise in here
What do I look like to you?
What do you want me to be?
(A little) good for you
You, you, you, you
Ooh
(A little) good for you
A little more evil for me
Come and see, come and see, come and see
What do I look like to you?
What do you want me to be?
Good for you6Embed
