Paper Trails Lyrics
Better go back
Rhythm inside
Better go back
Here inside
I told you I would get you
The back of the hand
I told you I would find
A place to go
Paper trails on a mountain
And fruits on a table
A wooden house to live in
A baby to care
The grass green but...
The sun is blue
Better find a way
To get through to you
Where are you when I need you?
Where did you go?
How can I find you when I need to?
Where should I go?
Paper trail on a mountain
And far away
A big trail on a mountain
You'll find a way
The fire outside
It's burning up place
But you're inside
Burning up ahead
Paper trails on a mountain
And fruits on a table
A wooden house to live in
A baby to care7Embed
