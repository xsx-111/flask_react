The Temple LyricsRoll on up--for my price is down
Come on in--for the best in town
Take your pick of the finest wine
Lay your bets on this bird of mine
Roll on up--for the price is down
Come on in--for the best in town
Take your pick of the finest wine
Lay your bets on this bird of mine
Name your price I got everything
Come and buy it's going fast
Borrow cash on the finest terms
Hurry now while stocks still last
Will you touch? Will you mend me Christ?
Won't you touch? Will you heal me Christ?
Won't you kiss? Will you cure me Christ?
Won't you kiss? Won't you pay me Christ?
Roll on up--for my price is down
Come on in--for the best in town
Take your pick of the finest wine
Lay your bets on this bird of mine
Roll on up--for the price is down
Come on in--for the best in town
Take your pick of the finest wine
Lay your bets on this bird of mine
Name your price I got everything
Come and buy it's going fast
Borrow cash on the finest terms
Hurry now while stocks still last
Will you touch? Will you mend me Christ?
Won't you touch? Will you heal me Christ?
Won't you kiss? Can you cure me Christ?
Won't you kiss? Won't you pay me Christ?
Roll on up--for the price is down
Come on in--for the best in town
Take your pick of the finest wine
Lay your bets on this bird of mine
Roll on up--for the price is down
Come on in--for the best in town
Take your pick of the finest wine
Lay your bets on this bird of mine
My temple should be a house of prayer
But you have made it a den of thieves
Get Out! My time is almost through
See my eyes I can hardly see
See me stand I can hardly walk
I believe you can make me whole
See my tongue I can hardly talk
See my skin I'm a mass of blood
See my legs I can hardly stand
I believe you can make me well
See my purse I'm a poor poor man
Will you touch? Will you mend me Christ?
Won't you touch? Will you heal me Christ?
Will you kiss? Can cure me Christ?
Won't you kiss? Won't you pay me Christ?
See my eyes I can hardly see
See me stand I can hardly walk
I believe you can make me whole
See my tongue I can hardly talkEmbed
