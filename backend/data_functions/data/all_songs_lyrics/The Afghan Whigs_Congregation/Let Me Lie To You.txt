Let Me Lie To You LyricsAll alone, all alone
No one to play with
Your eyes are all swollen from crying
Feeling sick, you open it
And discover your lover between the legs of another
And he's loving it
Let me lie to you
Let me lie to you
I'll be kind when I deceive you
She must never question me
Just quietly believe
There, there
You haven't a care
I won't ever hurt you, deny or desert you
Don't ask me again
Wake up and listen to thee
Someone must have told you
Someone must control you before you can get free
Let me lie to you
Let me lie to you
Be kind when I deceive you
You must never question me
Just quietly believe
All alone, all alone
No one to play with
No one to play with
No one to play withEmbed
