Congregation LyricsI walk around with this all over me
I cannot wash it clean
You've got the ball
You've got the ball i'm taking it from you
And today
It's in the blood
I left it in the blood you see
So put the words together
I'll be with you forever
Get up
We'll rise
They'll pay
And wait until tomorrow night
I can't recall yet if i'm black
Or if i'm white or wrong
Or if i'm white or wrong
I am your creator
Come with me my congregation
Get up i'll smack you back down
Get up
We'll rise
They'll pay
Get up i'll smack you back down
You will become my diamond
I'm yours and you are mine
Get up
We'll riseEmbed
