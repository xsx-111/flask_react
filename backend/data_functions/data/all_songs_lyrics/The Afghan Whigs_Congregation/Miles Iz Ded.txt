Miles Iz Ded LyricsIf I stepped it off
Walked outside your trance
Crawled inside your mind
And got my hands into your pants
Wouldn't that beat all?
Wouldn't that be great?
And all the things you do to me
We could exaggerate
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Now everybody knows
Everybody wants to know
The hows, the whens, the whys
Of how I said goodbye
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooooooh
If I stepped it off
Walked inside your trance
Crawled inside your mind
And got my hand into your pants
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Don't forget the alcohol
Ooh baby ooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooh baby
Oooooooh
Oooh baby
Oooh babyEmbed
