Tonight LyricsHey, baby there's a vampire moon
Scaling the sky
Shine in your room
Your eyes are open
You got nothing to do
Come outside and play with me
Tonight
Follow me down to the bushes dear
No one will know
We'll disappear
I'll hold your hand
We'll never tell
Our private little trip to hell
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Can I walk you home?
Can I walk you home?
Can I walk you home tonight?
Can I walk you home?
Can I walk you home?
Can I walk you home tonight? Tonight? Tonight? Tonight?Embed
