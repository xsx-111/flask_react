That Was Me Lyrics
That was me at the scout camp, in the school play
Spade and bucket by the sea
That was me
That was me playing conkers at the bus stop
On a blanket in the blue bells
That was me

The same me that stands here now
When I think that all this stuff
Can make a life that's pretty hard to take it in
That was me

Well, that was me, royal iris, on the river
Merseybeatin' with the band
That was me
Yeah, that was me
Sweating cobwebs under contract
In the cellar, on TV
That was me

The same me that stands here now
If fate agreed that all of this
Would make a lifetime
Who am I to disagree?
That was me
Yeah, that was me
That was me accapella at the altar
In the middle of the picture
That was me
That was me at the party sweating cobwebs
In a cellar on TV
Yeah, that was me

The same me that stands here now
When I think that all this stuff
Can make a life, it's pretty hard to take it in
That was me

That was me
That was meEmbed
