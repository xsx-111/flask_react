Why So Blue Lyrics
Staring from a cardboard castle down and out
One of life's young students finds out what it's all about
Paper flutters, angry taxi drivers shout
From the pages of a paper, candles shine
On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine
They suggest a highly recommended wine
Once again the same old line

Why so sad, my fine young friend?
Why so blue?

Weary carriage horses stand in single file
Someone at a crowded bus stop wears a friendly smile
Touching nerves that no one's heard from in a while
Papers from the same old file

Why so sad, my fine young friend?
Why so blue?

Sometimes, when eyes meet, you know
They have to meet again
Sometimes birds of a feather
Got to fly together
From a dingy attic window candles shine
On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine
Now they drink the highly recommended wine
Free at last and feeling fine
I'm so glad, my fine young friend
Glad for you
I'm so glad, my fine young friend
Glad for you

You used to be so blue, you used to be so blue
Why so blue?1Embed
