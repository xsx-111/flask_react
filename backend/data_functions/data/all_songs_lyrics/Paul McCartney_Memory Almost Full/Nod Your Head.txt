Nod Your Head Lyrics
If you really love me baby, better than staying in bed
If you really love me baby, nod your head
If you really love me baby till you fall down dead, she said
If you ever want to make it, nod your head

Nod it up, nod it down
Side to side, around and 'round
'Round and 'round

If you ever want to prove it, then you hang it on a thread
If you ever want to shake it, nod your head
If you think the life you're leading is better then the life you led
If you like the life you're living, well, nod your head

Well nod it up, nod it down
Side to side, 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round

If you really love me baby, better than staying in bed
If you really love me baby, nod your headEmbed
