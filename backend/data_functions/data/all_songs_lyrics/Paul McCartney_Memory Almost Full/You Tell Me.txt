You Tell Me Lyrics
A-one, two, three

When was that summer when the skies were blue?
The bright red cardinal flew down from his tree
You tell me

When was that summer when it never rained?
The air was buzzing with the sweet old honeybee
Let's see
You tell me

Were we there? Was it real?
Is it truly how I feel?
Maybe
You tell me

Ooh

Were we there? Is it true?
Was I really there with you?
Let's see
You tell me
When was that summer of a dozen words?
The butterflies and hummingbirds flew free
Let's see
You tell me

Ah let's see
You tell me (You tell me)Embed
