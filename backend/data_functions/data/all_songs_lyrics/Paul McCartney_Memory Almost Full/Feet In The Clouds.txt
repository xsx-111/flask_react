Feet In The Clouds Lyrics
The teacher said I had my head in the clouds
They directed, I suspected, disconnected
Hat in my way

On the street, I had my feet on the ground
Stood corrected, well protected, resurrected
Had it my way

I've got my feet in the clouds, got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square as long as they're not around
But I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Yes, I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard

Love is fab, it's like a stab in the heart
My hidden treasure, made to measure, for my pleasure
I had it my way

I've got my feet in the clouds, got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square as long as they're not around
But I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh, I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Yes, I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh I find it, yes I find it hard
Find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh I find it, and I find it hard
Find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh I find it, and I find it hard
Find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh I find it, and I find it hard
Find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh I find it, yes I find it hard
I've got my feet in the clouds (Feet in the clouds)
(Head on the ground) Head on the ground
(I'm not a square) I'm not a square
(They're not around) As long as they're not around
(It's so hard) Yeah, but I find it so hard
(It's so hard, it's so hard) I find it so hardEmbed
