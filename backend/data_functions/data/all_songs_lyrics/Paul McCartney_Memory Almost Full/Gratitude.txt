Gratitude Lyrics
Gratitude, gratitude, gratitude

I'm so grateful for everything
You've ever given me
How can I explain what it means
To be loved by you?
By you, loved by you
Loved by you

Show my gratitude, gratitude
Show my gratitude
I want to show my gratitude, gratitude
Yeah

Well I was lonely
I was living with a memory
But my cold and lonely nights ended
When you sheltered me
Loved by you, I was loved by you
Yeah, I was loved by you

I want to show my gratitude
Want to show my gratitude
Yeah, show my gratitude to you
Gratitude, show my gratitude to you
Mmm, yeah
I should stop loving you
Think what you put me through
But I don't want to lock my heart away
I will look forward to
Days when I'll be loving you
Until then, gonna wish and hope and pray
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I want to show my gratitude, gratitude
Mmm, yeah I want to show my gratitude
Show my gratitude
Yeah my gratitude

To be loved by you, be loved by you
To be loved by you, loved by you
Gratitude, I want to show my
Gratitude
