Only Mama Knows Lyrics
Well, I was found in the transit lounge
Of a dirty airport town
What was I doing on the road to ruin?
Well, my mama laid me down
My mama laid me down

Around my hand was a plastic band
With a picture of my face
I was crying, left to die
In this godforsaken place
This godforsaken place

Only Mama knows
Why she laid me down in this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from, I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows

I'm passing through, I'm on my way
On the road, no ETA
I'm passing through, no fixed abode
And that is why I need to try to hold on
I've got to hold on
I've got to hold on
Was it planned as a one night stand
Or did she leave in disgrace?
Well, I never, will I ever see my father's face?
See my father's face?

Only Mama knows
Why she laid me down in this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from, I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows
Why she laid me down in this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from, I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows (Only Mama knows)
Only Mama knows (Only Mama knows)
(Only Mama knows)
(Only Mama knows)

I've got to hold on
I've got to hold on
Got to hold on1Embed
