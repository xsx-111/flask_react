Vintage Clothes Lyrics
Don't live in the past
Don't hold on to something that's changing fast
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes (Vintage clothes)
Vintage clothes
Vintage clothes

We jump up for joy
Who cares if we look like a girl or boy?
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes
Vintage clothes

A little more, a little tall
Check the rack
What went out is coming back

Don't live in the past
Don't hold on to something that's changing fast
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes
A little more, a little tall
Check the rack
What went out, is coming backEmbed
