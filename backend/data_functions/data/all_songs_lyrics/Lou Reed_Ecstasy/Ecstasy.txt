Ecstasy LyricsThey call you ecstasy
Nothing ever sticks to you
Not velcro, not scotch tape
Not my arms dipped in glue
Not if I wrap myself in nylon
A piece of duct tape down my back
Love pierced the arrow with the twelve
And I can't get you back
Ah, ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ah, ecstasy
Across the streets an old Ford, they took off its wheels
The engine is gone
In its seat sits a box
With a note that says, Goodbye Charlie, thanks a lot
I see a child through a window with a bib
And I think of us and what we almost did
The Hudson rocketing with light
The ships pass the Statue of Liberty at night
They call it ecstasy, ah
Ecstasy
Ecstasy, ah
Ecstasy
Some men call me St. Ivory
Some call me St. Maurice
I'm smooth as alabaster
With white veins runnin' through my cheeks
A big stud through my eyebrow
A scar on my arm that says, Domain
I put it over the tattoo
That contained your name
They called you ecstasy, ecstasy
Ecstasy
They call you ecstasy, ecstasy
Ecstasy
The moon passing through a cloud
A body facing up is floating towards a crowd
And I think of a time and what I couldn't do
I couldn't hold you close, I couldn't, I couldn't become you
They call you ecstasy, I can't hold you down
I can't hold you up
I feel like that car that I saw today, no radio
No engine, no hood
I'm going to the cafe, I hope they've got music
And I hope that they can play
But if we have to part
I'll have a new scar right over my heart
I'll call it ecstasy
Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ecstasy, ecstasy
