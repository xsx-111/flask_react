Mystic Child LyricsIt was only the time of the newly born dead
With wispy cobwebs in your head
The polar moon looked out instead
Goin' wild
Liquor shifting through the brain
The manic depressive goes insane
Goin' wild
Goin' wild
Desperate anger hits the streets
By the foul smelling river by the meat market
Goin' wild
Mystic child
Goin' wild
Mystic child
In the winter with frozen toes
Looking out the big windows
To fly
Goin' wild
Situation X out of control
My eyes half opened like a mole
Who smiles
Goin' wild
Who smiles
Goin' wild
In the mystic morning where the river meets
The hurdy-gurdy of the hip-hop beat
5 a.m. the viscous street
Oh, wild
Goin' wild
Out the window like a flash
Fallin' through a rooftop crash
Blind
Goin' wild
Sick and misty like a pup by the curb
He's throwin' up
Wild
Like a child
Goin' wild
Like a child
If he can't have all that relates
To testify that he is great
He'll cut someone with a broken plate
Stand upon the subway grate
And smile
Goin' wild
Goin' wild
With a smile
Holy morning
Sun is up and someone
Here has lost his cups
The dawn is tattered all cut up
Goin' wild
Like a mystic child
Like a mystic child
Sunday morning looking down from the rooftop
Goin' wild with a smile
Mystic child
Top of the world he's got it made
Rings are gold, braids are jade
Jumped to the street, he's got it made
Goodbye, child
Goodbye, child
Mystic child
Goin' wild
Like a mystic child
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goin' wild, ah
Goin' wild
Like a mystic child
Holy morning
Sun is up and someone
Going wild
Like a mystic, like a mystic, like a mystic -
- Child
Goin'-goin', goin'-goin' wild
Like a mystic child
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Jumped to the streetEmbed
