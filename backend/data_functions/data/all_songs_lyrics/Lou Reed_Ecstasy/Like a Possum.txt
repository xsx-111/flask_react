Like a Possum LyricsGood morning, it's possum day
Feel like a possum in every way
Like a possum
Possum whiskers, possum face
Possum breath and a possum taste
Ooohhh, like a possum
Possum tales, possum eyes
Possum bones, possum thighs
Oh, like a possum
Possum shots, possum runs
Possum sleeps to possum drums
Calm as an angel
Good morning, it's possum day
I feel like a possum in every way
Like a possum
Wake up with a possum smile
Look at me, look at this smile
Like a possum
Things are all right, don't worry about this
My mind's amiss, I've lost the kiss
My smile is leaden, my gait is rubber
And I say as one possum to another like a possum
Calm as an angel
The only thing I hope to never see
Is another possum in this tree
Playing possum
Just like a possum
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
It won't be filled by a one-night fuck
Slurping and squeezing ain't it just my luck
Got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
The size of a truck
The devil tried to fill me up but my down was high
As the sky is up, ah
Ain't that just my luck
Calm as an angel
Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
Shooting and coming 'til it hurts
Calm, calm, ah, calm
Calm as an angel
They're mating like apes in the zoo
Ah, one for me and one for you
Wouldn't it just be lovely
Another useless night in bed, ah, ah
By the Hudson River, the roller-bladers giving head
Used condoms float on the river edge's head
Wouldn't it be lovely
Wouldn't it be lovely
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
It won't be filled by one-night fuck
Like a possum
Like a possum
Ahhh
Calm as an angel
You know me I like to dance a lot
With different selves who cancel out
One another
I'm the only one left standing
One likes muscles, oil and dirt
And the other likes the women with the butt that hurts
Like a possum
Devil tried to fill me up
But my down was high as the sky is up
Calm as an angel
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
And it won't be filled by a one-night fuck
Like a possum
You know me I like to drink a lot
And carry on
Don't know which self will show up, ah
Over the 5 a.m. sun, -
- The moon is shining
Over the docks shining
Ooohhh, calm as an angel
Girls in the market know what I'm about
They pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts, ah
With a pierced tongue licking below a stained T-shirt
Look at this smile
My mind's amiss
Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
Shooting and coming 'til it hurts
Calm, calm
Sitting on a curb I throw a rock
At the passing meat market trucks
It's just my luck
I'm the only one left standing
Now you know me I like to drink a lot, ah
Only one left standing
The girls in the market know what I'm about
They pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts
Licking below a stained T-shirt
Calm as an angel
Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
Shooting and coming baby 'til it hurts
Wouldn't it be, wouldn't it be
Wouldn't it be love
Wouldn't it be lovely
Calm as an angel
Got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
It won't be filled by one-night fuck
Ain't it just my luck
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
Another useless night in bed
Walk down the Hudson River getting head
Calm, calm, calm, calm, calm as an angel
Don't know why baby, I'm still here strong
And fearless in the outside air
I'm the only one left standing
I'm the only one
The only one
The only one left standing
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
Left standing
Calm as an angel
I'm the only one
I'm the only one, the only one
Left standing
Calm as an angel
Shooting an coming 'til it hurts
O'holy morning
Calm as an angelEmbed
