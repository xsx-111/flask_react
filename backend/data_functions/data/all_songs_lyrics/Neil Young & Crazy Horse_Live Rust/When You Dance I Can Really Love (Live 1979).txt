When You Dance I Can Really Love (Live 1979) Lyrics
When you dance
Do your senses tingle and take a chance?
In a trance
While the lonely mingle with circumstance
I've got something to tell you, you made it show
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh, I can really love

I can love
I can really love, I can really love
I can love
I can really love, I can really love
Like a mountain that's growing, a river that rolls
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh, I can really love

When you dance
Do your senses tingle and take a chance
In a trance
While the lonely mingle with circumstance
I've got something to tell you, you made it show
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh, I can really loveEmbed
