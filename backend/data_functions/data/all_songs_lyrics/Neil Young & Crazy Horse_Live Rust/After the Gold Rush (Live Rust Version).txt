After the Gold Rush (Live Rust Version) Lyrics
Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' somethin' about a queen
There were children singin' and drummers drummin'
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That floated on the breeze
We got Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s

I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie


Well, I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children cryin' and colors flyin'
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
We were flyin' Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flyin' Mother Nature's silver seed to a new homeEmbed
