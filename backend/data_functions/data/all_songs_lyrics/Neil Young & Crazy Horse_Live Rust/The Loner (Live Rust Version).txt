The Loner (Live Rust Version) Lyrics
He's a perfect stranger, like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger and a changer of the ways he talks
He's the unforeseen danger, the keeper of the key to the locks

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
He's the loner

If you see him in the subway, he'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move until he knows he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone, he'll know that you arе

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, opеn wide
He's the loner


There was a woman he knew about a year or so ago
She had something that he needed and he pleaded with her, "Please do not go"
On the day that she left, he died but it did not show
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
He's the loner


Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the lonerEmbed
