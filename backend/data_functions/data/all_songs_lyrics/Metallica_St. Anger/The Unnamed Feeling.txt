The Unnamed Feeling Lyrics
(Been here before)
(Been here before)
(Been here before)
(Been here before)
(Been here before)
(Been here before)
(Been here before)

Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
But do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?
Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's coming

It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more
Ooh, I die, I die, I die
A little more
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

(Been here before)
(Been here before)
(Been here before)
(Been here before)
(Been here before)
(Been here before)
(Been here before)

I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
Found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore
Cross my heart, hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon

It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more
Ooh, I die, I die, I die
A little more
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
It takes me away, it takes me
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive, yeah yeah
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away, yeah it takes me away

Get the fuck out of here
I just want to get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, why? Why? Why me?
I cannot sleep with a head like this
I want to cry, I want to scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I want to hate it all away
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive, yeah yeah
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
Then I wait for this train
My toes are over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away, yeah, it takes me away
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away5Embed
