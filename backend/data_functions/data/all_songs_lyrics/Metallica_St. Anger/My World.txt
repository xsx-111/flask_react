My World Lyrics
The motherfuckers got in my head
Trying to make me someone else instead
It's my world now
It's my world now
It's my world
It's my world
"Mama, why's it raining in my room?"
"Cheer up boy, clouds will move on soon!"
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world
Sucker!

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out
Who's in charge of my head today
Dancing devils in angels way
It's my time now
It's my time now
It's my time
Yeah, it's my time!
Look out motherfuckers here I come
Gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world
Sucker!

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is
God it feels like it only rains on me
God it feels like it only rains on me
God it feels like it only rains on me
God it feels like it only rains on me

Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is
Sucka!

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out
Enough's enough
Enough's enough
Enough's enough
Enough's enough
Enough's enough
Enough's enough
Enough's enough
Enough's enoughEmbed
