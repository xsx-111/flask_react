Sweet Amber Lyrics
Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine
Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine

Oh, then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
Oh, then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile

Using what I want to get what you want
Using what I want to get what you want
Using what I want to get what you want
Using what I want to get what you want

Oh, sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over until I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away but I'm back again
Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over until I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away but I'm back again

Oh, then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile, oh yeah
Then she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile

Using what I want to get what you want
Using what I want to get what you want
Using what I want to get what you want
Using what I want to get what you want

Oh, sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in
She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in
Ooh, sweet Amber
Oh, sweet Amber


Oh, sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?

It's never as sweet as it seems3Embed
