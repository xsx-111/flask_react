Shoot Me Again Lyrics
I won't go away
Right, Right here I'll stay
Stand silent in flames
Stand tall until it fades

Shoot Me Again
I ain't dead yet
C'mon Shoot Me Again
I ain't dead yet
I said Shoot Me Again
I ain’t dead yet
C’mon Shoot Me Again
I ain’t dead yet
Come on

Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me
Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me Again
Come on
Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me
Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me Again
Come on
All these shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you
All the shots
All the shots
All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

I won't go away (with a bullet in my back!)
Right, Right here I'll stay (with a bullet in my back!)
Shoot me (take a shot)
Shoot me (take a shot)
Shoot me (take a shot)
Shoot me (take a shot)
I'll stand on my own (with a bullet in my back!)
I'm stranded and sold (with a bullet in my back!)
Shoot Me Again
I ain't dead yet
C'mon Shoot Me Again
I ain't dead yet
Yeah Shoot Me Again
I ain’t dead yet
C’mon Shoot Me Again
I ain’t dead yet
I said

Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me Again
Come on
Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me Again
Come on
Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me
Shoot Me Again
Shoot Me Again
Yeah!

All these shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you
All the shots
All the shots
All the shots I take (Hey!)
What difference did I make? (What difference did I make?)
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

I bite my tongue
Trying not to shoot back
No compromise
My heart won't pump the other way
Wake the sleeping giant
Wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog
No, Let him sleep
Bite my tongue
Trying not to shoot back

All these shots I take
I spit back at you, yeah
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you, oh
All the shots
All the shots
All the shots I take, hey
What difference did I make? (What difference did I make?)
All the shots I take
I spit back at you, oh3Embed
