Thick as Thieves Lyrics
I held up a liquor store
Demanding top shelf metaphors
Sinner's smile and open arms
Drop a line to charm the silent alarm
Neutral angels calling the cops
They'll be choosing sides when the fighting stops
Polizei in the cabaret
While we six kings made our getaway

Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
With an ocean in between

Laughter in the darkness
Whispers in the shadows
I was there when the wall fell down
I'll be there when the ocean rises
Building castles of cans and bottles
Drinking like they do in novels
Know they'll catch me by and by
But tonight you are my alibi
Same old sun that we all come from
Faded stars in the air that we breathe
In the earth, in the sea

Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
With an ocean in betweenEmbed
