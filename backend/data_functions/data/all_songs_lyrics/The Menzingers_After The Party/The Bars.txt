The Bars LyricsSunken eyes and strangers' faces
I fall asleep in the strangest places
What the hell am I doing?
Where have my friends gone?
Can't stand these people no more
But you cannot leave when you can't find the door
Smashed my phone, lost my wallet
Who's this new friend of mine?
Why do some people make you nervous
And others drive you to drink when the bars are closing?
Nightstand memorial to past libation
A sudden fear of phone vibrations
Too hung over to sleep
Too tired to stay alive
Benzos, bile, and bills
There's so much missing time to kill
I shake like an airplane on its way down
Why do some people make you nervous
And others drive you to drink when the bars are closing?
When the bars are closing
No good'll come from stumbling home with the sun
No good'll come from stumbling home with the sun
I used to care
Now I stare into the sunken eyes and strangers' faces
I fall asleep in the strangest places
What the hell am I doing?
Where have my friends gone?
Why do some people make you nervous
And others drive you to drink when the bars are closing?
When the bars are closingEmbed
