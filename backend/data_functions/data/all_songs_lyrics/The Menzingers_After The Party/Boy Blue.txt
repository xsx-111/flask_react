Boy Blue Lyrics
Took our father's name and our mother's heart
Felt the sister's pain then it fell apart
We were told one thing and they showed us another
Is it finally true, we're not getting any younger?

The boy blue with the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send them off on their honeymoon

Dreadful sound echoed through the trees
Dirty headlights put us on our knees
Route 502, we were waiting for you
But you couldn't see
It was New Year's Eve
Wait with me

The boy blue with the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send them off on their honeymoon
I've been told there's no going home
No room for you and me
No empty seats in eternity
I've been told no going home
No song left to sing
No second act to mortality

The boy blue with the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send them off on their honeymoon
The boy blue with the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send them off on their honeymoonEmbed
