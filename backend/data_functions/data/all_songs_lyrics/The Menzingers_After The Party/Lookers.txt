Lookers LyricsLost in a picture frame
The way our bodies used to behave
The way we smiled in the moment
Before they permanently froze
But that was the old me and you
When we were both lookers
Lost in a picture frame
The way my body used to behave
The way I smiled in the moment
Before it permanently froze
But that was the old me
I was such a looker in the old days
You little Kerouac
Always running like Dean and Sal
Always waiting on a freight train
Always looking for a story to tell
But that was the old you
You were such a looker in the old days
Yeah! We were both lookers!
Sha la la la
Jersey girls are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar
I still wonder where you are
Cause I know the old you
And you know the old me
I was certain that I'd find her
In the back of the diner
In a cloud full of nicotine
In a teenage memory
That I hold till eternity
Cause the future ain't coming for it
Yeah! We were both lookers!
Sha la la la
Jersey girls are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar
I still wonder where you are
Sha la la la
Jersey girls are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar
I still wonder where you are
Cause I knew the old you
And you knew the old me
When we were both lookers
In a 5"x8" black and white
On the nightstand of my mind
From a time I hardly recognize
Sha la la la
Jersey girls are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar
I still wonder where you are
Sha la la la
Jersey girls are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar
I still wonder where you are
Cause I know the old you
And you know the old me
When we were both lookersEmbed
