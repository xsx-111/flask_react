Midwestern States LyricsI hope this isn't a burden
Thanks for having us over
We could sleep on the couch
We could sleep on the floor
We would leave before you even noticed we were here
Even notice us at all
Been having problems with our landlord
He said he's taking us both to court
She got her hours slashed
And my unemployment's drying up fast
We both got worthless diplomas from worthless universities
Two bachelors in worthless studies
But at least it made our parents happy
And cost a whole lot of money
You said LA's only two days if we drive straight
Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the midwest states
The midwestern states
The midwestern states
The midwestern states
The midwestern states
But I know somewhere in Chicago where we can stay for a little
I hope this isn't a burden
Thanks for having us over
Most nights we always fall asleep with something dumb on Netflix
Some nights trash reality or kids cartoons or shitty documentaries
Not perfect but we're good together
Yeah, me, you, and our bad tattoos
Yeah, all our stick and pokes, all our inside jokes
We'll regret them when we're dead and sober
But we're still breathing and the party ain't over
You said LA's only two days if we drive straight
Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the midwest states
You said LA's only two days if we drive straight
Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the midwest states
The midwestern states
The midwestern states
The midwestern states
The midwestern statesEmbed
