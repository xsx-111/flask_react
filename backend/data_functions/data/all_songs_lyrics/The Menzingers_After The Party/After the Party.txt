After the Party Lyrics
It's the little things my mind commits
To etch behind my eyelids
Like getting stoned when we wake up
Coffee grounds and coffee cups
Your silhouette in high top sneakers
And hardcore from laptop speakers
The classics to the more obscure
From Minor Threat to your old roommate's band

Like a kaleidoscope in vibrant hues
I navigate around your tattoos
Said you got that one on a whim
When you were breaking up with him
And that Matryoshka Russian doll
That lines your shelf from big to small
What a way to start anew
To shed your skin and find the old you

Everybody wants to get famous
But you just want to dance in a basement
You don't care if anyone is watching
Just as long as you stay in motion
We put miles on these old jean jackets
Got caught up in the drunk conversations
But after the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you
With a new outlook on everything we see
From high upon this rooftop over South Philly
To the nights we lose our self-control
From the sex, from the drugs, from the rock and roll

Everybody wants to get famous
But you just want to dance in a basement
You don't care if anyone is watching
Just as long as you stay in motion
We put miles on these old jean jackets
Got caught up in the drunk conversations
But after the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you6Embed
