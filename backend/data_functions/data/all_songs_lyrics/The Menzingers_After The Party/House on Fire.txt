House on Fire LyricsWaiting for your life to start then you die, whoa
Was your heart beating in the first place?
Waiting for your life to start then you die, whoa
Was your heart beating in the first place?
Lost myself in the kitchen
There's an old friend falling down the stairs
He said there's cops in the alleyway
It's too late for saving us
Let it burn down
Waiting for your life to start then you die, whoa
Was your heart beating in the first place?
Waiting for your life to start then you die, whoa
Was your heart beating in the first place?
Found myself in the basement
There's smoke, there's ash over everything
This girl I know, yeah, she's trying to get high
She's telling me, she's telling me
"Let it burn up"
Yeah, does it make you nervous?
Have you fulfilled your purpose?
Yeah, does it make you nervous?
The house is on fire
Yeah, does it make you nervous?
Have you fulfilled your purpose?
Yeah, does it make you nervous?
The house is on fire
There's beer left, so I think I'll stay
Waiting for your life to start then you die, whoa
Was your heart beating in the first place?
Waiting for your life to start then you die, whoa
Was your heart beating in the first place?
We set the house on fire
And we ain't going nowhere
We set the house on fire
And we ain't going nowhere
We set the house on fire
And we ain't going nowhere
We set the house on fire
And we ain't going nowhereEmbed
