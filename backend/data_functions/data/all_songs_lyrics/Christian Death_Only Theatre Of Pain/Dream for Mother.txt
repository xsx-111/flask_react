Dream for Mother LyricsI'm dreaming about her mother dying
My mind is set at ease
Number the models, spreading disease
Nodding to acquaintances to be sure
Making 'Him' a household word
I'll introduce realism, the eye of the beholder
The final resting places of
Many would-be heroes
In New York City park after dark
The time of clinical death is fixed
Death is fixed
Don't be frightened
Necrophiliac relationship
During the freezing process
Note the murders, grisly attitude
Crossed above my head to protect it from the rocks
Palliations for a weaker sex
Palliations for a weaker sex
Palliations for a weaker sex
Palliations for a weaker sex
I'm avoiding what I can see
Dreaming about her mother dying1Embed
