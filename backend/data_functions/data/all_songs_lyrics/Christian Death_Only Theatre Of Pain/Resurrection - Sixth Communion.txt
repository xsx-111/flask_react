Resurrection - Sixth Communion LyricsThe ceremony cradles my head in trance
I brush dust from my teeth
Fleeing hands and spiders plead for salvation
They wash the clawed feet of a priest
Ritual mockery, rectified doubt
I'm holding with arms open wide
Sleeping endless sleep on a bed of nails
Wake me up with your kiss
I'm waiting for confirmation
I'm waiting for confrontation
I'm waiting for contemplation
Waiting for a place to lay my body down
The proud encasings of another's soul
Buried deep 'neath the shroud
Flourished with the venom of a serpent's son
I close my eyes, retreat
The prayer hand lays down on the edge of my sleep
Sister Death in leper's guise
Through crimson eyes of the Holy One
Everyone will learn to see
I'm waiting for confrontation
I'm waiting for contemplation
I'm waiting for confirmation
Waiting for a place to lay my body down
Invitations are invocations
To the bloody red sheets
The circle is broken by the silence
The sacrifice of one
I'm waiting for confirmation
I'm waiting for confrontation
I'm waiting for contemplation
Waiting for a place to lay my body down
Resurrection, past discretions
Resurrection, last discretion
