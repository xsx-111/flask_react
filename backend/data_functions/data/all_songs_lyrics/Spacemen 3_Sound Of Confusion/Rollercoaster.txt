Rollercoaster Lyrics
Well, I met someone some time ago
His eyes were clear to see
He showed me things in my own mind
That I wish all the world could see
He stopped me from living so insane
I can be just what I wanna be
Things appear as they really are
I can see just what I want to see

Well, come on and let it happen to you
Well, come on and let it happen to you
You gotta open up your mind and let everything come through

Well, it starts like a rollercoaster ride
So real it takes your breath away
It slides you through your point of view
You look back to where you thought you'd stay
When your ride changes you
Exactly like a neon ray
You don't have to search for words anymore
There's nothing you need to say

Well, come on and let it happen to you
Well, come on and let it happen to you
You gotta open up your mind and let everything come through
After your trip, life opens up
You start doing what you wanna do
You find out that the world that you once feared
Gets what it has with you
No one can ever hurt you
Because now you know more than you thought you knew
You're looking at the world with brand new eyes
And no one can ever spoil the view

Well, come on and let it happen to you
Hey, hey, hey, well come on, you gotta let it happen to you
You gotta open up your mind and let everything come through

Just open up your mind
And let everything
Come throughEmbed
