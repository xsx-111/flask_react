O.D. Catastrophe Lyrics
Do you see that kid
Down on his luck?
Do you see that kid?
Just spent his last buck

Well, he got a O.D. catastrophe
He got a big O.D
He got a O.D. catastrophe
Woah, yeah

Do you see that kid
Down on his back?
Do you see that kid
Down on his back?

Well, he got a O.D. catastrophe
He got a big O.D
He got a O.D. catastrophe
Woah, yeah

Well, do you see that kid?
Yeah, I loved him so
Do you see that kid?
Yeah, I loved him so
Well he got a O.D. catastrophe
He got a big O.D
He got a O.D. catastrophe
Woah, yeah
I said woah, yeah
I said woah, yeah
I said woah, yeahEmbed
