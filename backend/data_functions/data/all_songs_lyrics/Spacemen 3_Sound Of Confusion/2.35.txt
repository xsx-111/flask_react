2.35 Lyrics
Well it's 2.35 in the afternoon
You said you'd be comin' home quite soon
Now I've been waiting far too long
I wanna get down to sing my song
But babe, there's no more

Well, I've been down and I've been sad
And I've kicked things in and gotten me mad
I ain't had nothin' to take my mind
I ain't had nothin' for a long, long time
'Cos babe, there's no more

You think you're cool, you think you're neat
You think you're everybody's special treat
Now baby, take your hands off of me
I've got a somethin' for you but you ain't brought nothing for me
'Cos babe, there's no moreEmbed
