Little Doll Lyrics
Little doll, I can't forget
Smokin' on a cigarette
In my life, the real queen
Prettiest thing I ever seen
Uh-huh

You're the one who makes me sing
Bringin' happiness and everything
You're the only real one
A real way to have some fun
Uh-huh

Little doll, I can't forget
Smokin' on a cigarette
In my life, the real queen
Prettiest thing I ever seen
Uh-huhEmbed
