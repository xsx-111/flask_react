Hey Man Lyrics
Feelin' funny in my mind, Lord
Feelin' funny in my mind, Lord
Feelin' funny in my mind, Lord
I need it, Lord

Amen

Amen, Amen

There's a black smoke risin', Lord
There's a black smoke risin', Lord
There's a black smoke risin', Lord
Right above my head

Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen, Amen

Well, I don't mind dyin', Lord
I don't mind dyin', Lord
I don't mind dyin'
But I'd hate to leave my mother cryin'
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen, AmenEmbed
