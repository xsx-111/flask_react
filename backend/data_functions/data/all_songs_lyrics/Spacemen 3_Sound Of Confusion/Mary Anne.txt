Mary Anne Lyrics
Mary Anne, hold my hand
Pretty babe, I understand
You say it's time to grab it blind
Cheering crowds, they screw my mind

Just one time, I tell you now
Do your thing, girl, and do it loud
The desert sand, the secret plan
Lord's own knowledge is in your hand
Grab a hold and ride that freight
Be yourself, don't hesitate

Mary Anne, hold my hand
Pretty babe, I understand
You say it's time to grab it blind
Cheering crowds, they screw my mind

Just one time, that's all I ask
To do my thing, girl, and do it fast
The desert sand, the secret plan
Lord's own knowledge is in your hand
Grab a hold and ride that freight
Be yourself, don't hesitate
Mary Anne, hold my hand
Pretty babe, I understand
You say it's time to grab it blind
Cheering crowds, they screw my mind

Just one time, I tell you now
Do your thing, girl, and do it loud
The desert sand, the secret plan
Lord's own knowledge is in your hand
Grab a hold and ride that freight
Be yourself, don't hesitateEmbed
