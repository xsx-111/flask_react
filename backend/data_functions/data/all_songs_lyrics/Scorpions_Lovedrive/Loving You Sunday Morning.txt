Loving You Sunday Morning Lyrics
Working hard to get it on for you
Everyday and night
I give you all I've got to give
Take it all
Love I know that you're feelin' blue
Lonely deep inside
'Cause I know how it feels to be alone

Loving you Sunday morning
You were on my mind love everyday
Loving you Sunday morning
Your love makes me fly so far away

People tell me that I'm gonna lose you
Our love will die
So tell me is it true right or wrong
I never ever wanna lose your love
So I will change my life
Believe in me my love
I'm coming home

Loving you Sunday morning
You were on my mind love everyday
Loving you Sunday morning
Your love makes me fly so far away
Working hard to get it on for you
Every day and night
I give you all I've got to give
Take it all
So I will change my life
Believe in me my love
I'm coming home

Loving you Sunday morning
You were on my mind love everyday
Loving you Sunday morning
Your love makes me fly so far away1Embed
