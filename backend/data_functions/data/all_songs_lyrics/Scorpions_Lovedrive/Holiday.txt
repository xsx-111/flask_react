Holiday LyricsLet me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Exchange the cold days for the sun
A good time and fun
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Exchange your troubles for some love
Wherever you are
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Longing for the sun here we come
To the island without name
Longing for the sun here we come
On the island many miles away from home
Here we come on the island without name
Longing for the sun here we come
To the island many miles away from home
Away from home
Away from home
Away from home
Away from home1Embed
