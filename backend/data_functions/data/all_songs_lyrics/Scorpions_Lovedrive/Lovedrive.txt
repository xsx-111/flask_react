Lovedrive LyricsA girl to drive a car to love
The music rocks me down the motorway
My whore's got wings we're taking off
And I can't stop this flight of speed today
It's a lovedrive on wheels of fire
A lovedrive just one desire love
You drive me crazy Babe
The city lights of London town
Are far away my hand is on her wing
I stop the car and she gets down
I like to show why Scorpions got a sting
It's a lovedrive on wheels of fire
A lovedrive just one desire love
You drive me crazy BabeEmbed
