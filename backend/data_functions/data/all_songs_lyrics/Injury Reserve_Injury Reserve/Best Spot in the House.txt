Best Spot in the House Lyrics
This is the best, the best spot in the house?
Absolutely

Check it
Check it, yo, check it
I've had niggas that come up to me, say that they looked up to me, yeah
And that they been fuckin' with me since shit was ugly, yeah
And that these songs, man, they saved they life
Now, how you put that kind of power in these hands of mine?
And how a nigga 'posed respond to some shit like that?
Am I supposed to "Oh, thanks," pat they back?
I ain't tryna take away from the experience they had
But, honestly, I'm not prepared for some shit like that
And when they credit myself, they discredit themselves
And the strength that they had, yeah, to better themselves
And they talk about the strength that I have in my songs
But they don't know, behind them stories, there's some shit that's just wrong
And I hear 'em say that it was beautiful
But to me, man, that shit was inexcusable, uh
To talk about a death and not go to the funeral
Tellin' myself, "You gotta swallow all that guilt that chewed at you"
Shit was juvenile, like how was I too cowardly to go to your fuckin' funeral
But still feel like rappin' about your death was fuckin' suitable?
Was I true to you, or usin' you?
Or the unfortunate events to make my songs more moveable
My grief provable?
It's true though, I do wish I could call like shit was usual
Tell you shit's poppin', uh, tell you life's beautiful, uh
But I didn't check on you when you were still here, yeah
And that shit been eatin' at me for this past year, yeah
This remind me of Will dancin' on that couch
2014 Flagstaff, we're back now
Halloween a year later and we're drivin' home
I'll throw up eight times before we make it out
Still reminds me of Will dancin' on that couch
Saw him last week, he swears that we made it now
People watchin' now, better not let them down
I'll throw up eight times before we make it now
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Shout out to my brother Chuck, healthiest dude I know
One day, he was hoopin' and just dropped to the floor
In disbelief, man, I could never fathom that
His sister Rosie hit me like, "It might've been a heart attack"
Couldn't do shit about it, stuck in Arizona
Plus they brought him back, but I heard he's in a coma
Drop to my knees and I start to pray
Said, "If he wakes up, I swear that I'll call and text him every day"
Felt like a lifetime after a couple days went past
And I still ain't heard from your ass, man, wake the fuck up
Yo, luckily he did, my promise didn't last that long
You would text me, it would take like a week to respond
And I ain't got shit goin' on
Man, that's so fucked up
Two years later, seen your silhouette in that crowd
Last show, our first headlinin' tour, it's sold out
700 people, yeah, that shit was so wild
Seen that ugly-ass grin, knew I made you proud, yeah
This remind me of Will dancin' on that couch1Embed
