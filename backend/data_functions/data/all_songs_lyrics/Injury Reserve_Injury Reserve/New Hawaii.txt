New Hawaii Lyrics
I been callin' for you
Know that I been

Know that I been on your mind some time
It's one of them things you can't deny
And you know it's sweeter than the previous time
I'm just tryna get it right
'Cause I know that I been on your mind some time
It's one of them things you may not like
While I'm just coastin' up in New Hawaii
I'm in deeper than I thought I might
Know that I been on your mind some time
It's one of them things you can't deny
And you know it's sweeter than the previous time
I'm just tryna get it right
'Cause I know that I been on your mind some time
It's one of them things you may not like
While I'm just coastin' up in New Hawaii
I'm in deeper than I thought I might

I'm in deep
I'm in deeper than I thought
I'm in deeper than I thought
I'm in deep, I'm in deep, I'm in deep, I'm in deep
You know I've been fallin' for you for quite a long time now
And I've been callin' on you to let you know what I'm talkin' about, yeah
And I said, "How could I be fallin' if you see me standin' upright?"
Tell me how much longer if it's not goin' down tonight
Don't know how to call it when I'm asked about my love life
All these questions got me uptight
Now I'm all up in my bag, and in this bag there is no sunlight
The dark is not a habitat for me 'cause I'm a sunshine
Thinkin' 'bout somebody who ain't thought about me one time
You say you love me too, well bitch, act like it sometimes

You got me feelin' shit that I ain't felt before
You got me sayin' shit that I ain't said before
Well, I said it to my mom, I said it to my dad
I said it to some friends, but I don't mean like that
I'd put all my bread on us if I had to bid
You got me in my head, Picassoin' our kids
Like, would they get your eyes, would they get my nose?
Maybe I have it backwards, I don't know, who knows?
(I been on your mind some time)
Maybe they can dance, maybe they can rap
(It's one of them things you can't deny)
Or maybe be a doctor, nothin' like they dad
(And you know it's sweeter than the previous time)
Maybe by then technology could choose all that
(I'm just tryna get it right)
But I wouldn't do that shit, I love just what we have
('Cause I know that I been on your mind some time)
Edge of my bed, wonderin' why I deserve this
(It's one of them things you may not like)
Back in my head, Picassoin' our kids
(While I'm just coastin' up in New Hawaii)
Hopin' they're more of you and all this love you give
(I'm in deep, but then I thought I might)
Hopin' they meet someone that make them feel like this7Embed
