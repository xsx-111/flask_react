New chores, yeah, "New Freezer" shit
New nigga, you can tell by my demeanor
I'm just thinkin' ahead, stackin' big boy chips
Left arm four time the size on some Hellboy shit
My son gon' want his gadgets too, on some Elroy shit
And he'll be workin' for that tool on some bellboy shit

Maybe throw some threes on so they don't think I defer
Oh my god
