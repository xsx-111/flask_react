Three Man Weave Lyrics
Check it, yo
Woo
Check it, yo
Check it, yo
Check it, yo
Check it, yo

This remind a nigga of high school
No repercussions for the shit that I do
Check it, yo
My biggest worries were missin' a free throw
Now me, Groggs and P doin' the three man weave, though
When I was too pretentious for some Migos
Then Phonte made a song with Lil B, though
(It's Phontiga)
Check it, yo
Shit changed, that's some shit that we know
Now me, Groggs and P doin' the three man weave, though

I used to wanna be a hooper but I wasn't that good
Had the DaDa Cdubz with a panel of wood
Couldn't tell me that I wasn't on some king shit
But I had no jay so it really didn't mean shit, yeah
Sorry unc', you spent your money on those camps
But we both knew I never had a chance, let's keep it a buck
Like Ray in his rookie season
Then I found somethin' I was good at
Somethin' that I believed in
See me, I hooped a little but, shit, I was JVin'
In rap parallels I was like Russ decent?
Plus if it was today I'd prolly get kicked off for kneelin'
And shit they wouldn't trip it's not like them niggas would need me
Now the big three out here three man weavin'
Seven seconds or less, Marion, 'Mar'e, and Steven
On wax, need plaques or no achievin'
You can hold all that feedback, we don't need it, what's up?

This remind a nigga of high school
No repercussions for the shit that I do
Check it, yo
My biggest worries were missin' a free throw
Now me, Groggs and P doin' the three man weave, though
When I was too pretentious for some Migos
Then Phonte made a song with Lil B, though (Yessir, yessir, yessir, haha)
Check it, yo
Shit changed, that's some shit that we know
Now me, Groggs and P doin' the three man weave, though
This remind a nigga of high school
No repercussions for the shit that I do
Check it, yo
My biggest worries were missin' a free throw
Now me, Groggs and P doin' the three man weave, though
When I was too pretentious for some Migos
Then Phonte made a song with Lil B, though (Newtigallo, Newtigallo, Newtigallo)
Check it, yo
Shit changed, that's some shit that we know
Now me, Groggs and P doin' the three man weave, though
"Base 4 Your Face"
Haha, yeah5Embed
