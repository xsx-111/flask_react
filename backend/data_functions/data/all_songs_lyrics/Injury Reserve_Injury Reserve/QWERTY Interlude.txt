QWERTY Interlude Lyrics
Still milky, call it what you want, ho
More way-more way-find me, he's so thoughtful
Fourth grade FrostWire, BearShare bandit
Fourth grade FrostWire, BearShare bandit
Li-lime-imeWire, fifth grade so-scandalous
High school Pirate Bay, DatWAV scam-scam-scam
Gi-apologize, couldn’t fix damage
How I'm tryna make a dollar growin' up when CDs stop happen
Happen-hap-hap-op-op-op-hap-hap-hap-hap
Hold on, it keeps skippin’Embed
