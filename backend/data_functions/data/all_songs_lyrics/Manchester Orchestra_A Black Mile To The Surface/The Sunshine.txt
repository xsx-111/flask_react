The Sunshine Lyrics
I already know that I don't already know
You are the sunlight
I don't really care if you don't understand
You are the moonlight

And that's alright, alright with me
Oh, that's alright

I don't really mind if you don't really mind
You are the sunshine
You don't have to know if you don't want to know
You are the moonlight

Oh and that's alright, alright with me
Oh that's alright, alright with me
Oh that's alright, alright with me
Oh that's alright, alright with me
Oh that's alright, alright with me
Oh that's alright

Alright (I'm) alright (I'm) alright (I'm) alright (I'm) alrightEmbed
