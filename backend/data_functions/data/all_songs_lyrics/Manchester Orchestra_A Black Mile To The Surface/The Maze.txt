The Maze Lyrics
I notice you when you're noticing me
Breaking the habit, you're watching me sleep
Oh, give me some time, let me learn how to speak
I'm a maze to you

I never mind about bothering you
I'm trying to decide if I'll bother with you
So, feed me your wisdom and breathe me your truth
I'm amazing

Wish me a wonder and wish me to sleep
You don't have to wander to hear when I speak
There is nothing I've got when I die that I keep
It's amazing

Somebody said it's unspeakable love
Somebody said it's unspeakable love
Well, you don't believe I can speak well at all
You're a maze to me

First of a thousand to write on the wall
It's only beginning, it's swallowing us
Somebody said it's unspeakable love
It's amazing
You lift that burden off of me
You lift that burden off of me
You lift that burden off of meEmbed
