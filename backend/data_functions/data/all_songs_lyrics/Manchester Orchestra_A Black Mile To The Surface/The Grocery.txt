The Grocery Lyrics"I don't know where I'm going but I'm going anyways"
So you leave the apartment, grab the gun under the bed
I want to reach above the paradox where nobody can see
Want to hold a light to paradigm and strip it to its feet
I want to feel the way my father felt, is it easier for me?
I want to know if there's a higher love oblivious to me
So you walk in the grocery and you unload several rounds
"Don't you dare move a muscle," cardboard cutout ads
I want to reach above the paradox where nobody can see
Want to hold a light to paradigm and strip it to its feet
I want to feel the way your father felt, was it easy for belief?
I want to know if there's a higher love he saw that I can't see
Looking back, it's obvious now
You believe him or you don't
So you load up your pistol and you press it to your lips
And you squeeze on the trigger, all it does is clicks
I want to reach above the para-blind where nobody could see
Want to hold a light to paradise and see if I could sleep
I want to feel the way our fathers felt when it swept them off their feet
I want to know about that higher love you saw that can't be seen
The only obvious equation, you believe it or you don't
I've been trying to find the right way to get out of here
I've been trying to find the right way to get out of here
This is the only way to go
This is the only way3Embed
