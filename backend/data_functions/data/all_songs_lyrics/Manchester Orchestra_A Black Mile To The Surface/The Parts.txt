The Parts Lyrics
Turn off the alarm
Wonder where you are
I'd be a page in your book if you let me
Miles and miles of drones
Stain in a coffee cup
The truth will start to creep in if you let it

I wanted to know each part
Want to know each part of you

A yellow SUV
Britney Spears on the ceiling
You'd look my way but you weren't talking to me
Pulling up to Rob's, some Camel Lights, Averso
Your tan skin felt like universal envy

And I wanted to know each part
Want to know each part of you

Give it thirteen years
Both your legs up, you're crying
Trying to push a life out from your belly
I'm a water boy, overwhelmed by the screaming
Your clenched teeth, nails dug deep into my meaning
And I still want to know each part
Want to know each part of you
Yeah I still want to know each part
Want to know each part of you

Who?
You
You

Yeah I still want to know each part
Want to know each part of youEmbed
