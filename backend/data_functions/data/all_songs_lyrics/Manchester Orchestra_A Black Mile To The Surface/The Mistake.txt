The Mistake Lyrics
I don't want to die alone
Tell me there's another option for me
Standing like I should have known
I knew you'd accidentally look right inside of me

There's nothing anybody could say
There was nothing anybody could do
You made up your absent mind
And now the rest of us are here to amuse you

Everybody I know makes the same mistakes
Packaged up in different boxes, masking shame

Laying on the carpet spilt
You told me you were fairly sure that you'd marry him
Embryonic accidents, a native knife, you gotta finally bury it

There's nothing anybody could say
There was nothing anybody could do
Everybody's got their day
So number wisely if you know what's best for you, man
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes
Packaged up in different boxes, masking shame

I don't want to walk away from you
I don't want to walk away from you
I don't want to walk away from you
I don't want to walk away, but you let me

And now the wheels are falling off of the car
Beside the hundred meter grave in the yard
Everybody here feels sorry for us2Embed
