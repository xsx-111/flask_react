The Wolf Lyrics
Said, "In truth I don't really want to talk about it"
Christmas lights dangled sadly from the table in the operating room
Last I heard you're an addict about it
Full of rage and Corona
Trying to blow the birthday kid candles out
Trap doors and the retaliator lead out
To the field where our extended family buried their lies
If you're going, bring some faith and a flashlight
Follow signs that read
"It's twenty miles before you finally see fire"
(You may be paying too much for your life insurance policy)
Now there's something to say for the art of confusion
I got the courage to enquire where your body traveled all of the time
"I gotta climb out of this elevator, hadn't moved me once yet
Do I expect that it should really start now?"
The waitress oversees you levitating
Couldn't think it to words and watched your body lift up into the sky
Everyone there was just in awe about it
Seen a miracle and drank away the thought from our minds

There was you and me
And nothing in-between
It's right and wrong
Goes on and on and on
This is the wave that you could never conquer
Losing the smallest piece of truth we used to know
I wasn't prepared to embark with the wolf of the mountain
It wasn't a place that we could call our own
Now I don't want to seem like it's split at the seams
See the pain on the wall? See the blood in the street?
There is nothing you've got when you die that you keep
You were all that you were, were you all you could be?
In the blink of an eye there's a hole in your belly
Your body recoils ironically into the family planning aisle
I overhear, "I don't know where I'm going
I'm going anyway"
Don't let 'em tell you that I never found...

You and me and nothing in-between
It's right and wrong, goes on and on and on
(How long you been looking for...)
The truth for me is grasping at the seam
So truthfully, do you want to die for me?

This is the wave that you could never conquer
Losing the smallest piece of truth we used to know
I wasn't prepared to embark with the wolf of the mountain
It wasn't a place that we could call our ownEmbed
