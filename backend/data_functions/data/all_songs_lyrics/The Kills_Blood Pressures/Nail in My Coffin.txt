Nail in My Coffin LyricsI am no better at this than you are
Unfinished business maybe, do love
I can't change myself into you dear
What you are to me is far too unclear
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a nail in my coffin and lord knows I ain't ready yet
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a line I'm crossing and I am never gonna get back from
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I am no better at this than you are
Loneliness never truly leaves me alone
I have made mistakes I can't take back home
I love you just not the way you want
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a nail in my coffin and lord knows I ain't ready yet
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a line I'm crossing and I am never gonna get back from
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a nail in my coffin and lord knows I ain't ready yet
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a line I'm crossing and I am never gonna get back from
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a nail in my coffin and lord knows I ain't ready yet
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a line I'm crossing and I am never gonna get back from
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohEmbed
