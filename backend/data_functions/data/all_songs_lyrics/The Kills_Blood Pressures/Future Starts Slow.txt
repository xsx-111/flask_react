Future Starts Slow Lyrics
You can holler, you can wail
You can swing, you can flail
You can thump like a broken sail
But I'll never give you up
If I ever give you up my heart will surely fail

And after all God can keep my soul
England have my bones
But don't ever give me up
I could never get back up when the future starts so slow

No longing for the moonlight
No longing for the sun
No longer will I curse the bad I've done
If there's a time when your feelings gone, I wanna feel it

You can holler, you can wail
You can blow what's left of my right mind
You can swing, you can flail
You can blow what's left of my right mind
(I don't mind)
There's a time for the second best
And there's a time when the feeling's gone
But it's hard to be hard I guess
When you're shaking like a dog

You can holler, you can wail
You can blow what's left of my right mind
You can swing, you can flail
You can blow what's left of my right mind

You can holler, you can wail
You can blow what's left of my right mind
You can swing, you can flail
You can blow what's left of my right mind
(I don't mind)

You can blow what's left of my right mind
You can blow what's left of my right mind
You can holler, you can wail
You can blow what's left of my right mind10Embed
