The Last Goodbye LyricsIt's the last goodbye I swear
I can't rely on a dime-a-day love
That don't go anywhere
I'll learn to cry for someone else
I can't get by
On an odds and ends love
That don't ever match up
I heard all you said
And I took it to heart
I won't forget I swear
I have no regrets for the past is behind me
Tomorrow reminds me just well
Can't quite see the end
How can I rely on my heart if I break it
With my own two hands
I heard all you said
And I love you to death
I heard all you said
Don't say anything
It's the last goodbye I swear
I can't survive
On a half-hearted love
That will never be whole7Embed
