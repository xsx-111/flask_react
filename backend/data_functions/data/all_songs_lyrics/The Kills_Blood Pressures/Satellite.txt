Satellite LyricsLost her behind the station
Lost her behind the moon
Operator, operator, dial her back
Operator put me through
Ahuuuh, Satellite gave up the ghost too soon
Rising on the thermals
She's calling in and out the blue
Ahuuuh, carried her off on a silver spoon
I loved her too long, don't take her too
Oooohhh ohhhhhhh
Oh how he crossed us on that fate your path in my own satellite
What a mess a little time makes to us when time and place collide
Operator, operator, dial her back
Operator, operator, don't take her too
I loved her too long, don't love her too
Operator, operator, dial her back
Operator, operator, don't take her too
I love her too long, don't love her too
Don't love her too
Oooohhh ohhhhhhh...1Embed
