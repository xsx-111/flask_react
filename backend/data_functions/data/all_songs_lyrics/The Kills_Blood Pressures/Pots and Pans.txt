Pots and Pans LyricsI can't find enough pots and pans
Let alone knives in my kitchen
To keep you cooking
I can't find enough love in my heart
Let alone in my bones
To keep you standing
Ain't enough salt in the ocean
That cares enough to keep you floating
Ain't a drop left in my tank
To move, move your dead weight
I ain't joking
You're so good
I ain't joking when I said
You're so good
I can't find enough pots and pans
Let alone knives in my kitchen
To keep you cooking
I can't find enough love in my heart
Let along in my bones
To keep you standing
These are the days we'll never forget
When the dawn, dawns on youEmbed
