Damned If She Do LyricsShe damned if she do
She damned if she don't
If history hang hang hangs her well
Her memory won't
There's been a procession
Of sweet hearts passing through
Some of them left no trace at all
Some left her black and blue
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she on her last legs
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she on her last legs
She damned if she will
She damned if she won't
Some of them left in one piece
And some she damn near broke
And I am no stranger to the strange all his ways
What could be stranger than to be stuck outside your cage
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she on her last legs
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she on her deathbed
She come alive when she on her deathbed
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she on her last legs
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she on her deathbed
She come alive when she on her deathbed
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she dying
She come alive when she dyingEmbed
