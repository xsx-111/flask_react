Wild Charms LyricsTo doting boys by your side
Riding roughshod on your starless nights
To she who played concertos, foul and black
Upon my heartstrings
And never looked back
What became of those wild charms?
The deep fry of the tide?
The tug of the stars?
How it stirs me
How it stirs me now
To think my fire burnt them outEmbed
