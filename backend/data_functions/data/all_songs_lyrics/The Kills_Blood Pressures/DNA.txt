DNA Lyrics
When it came to pass
Glory passed me by
Fate with a single blow
Has custard-pied me now
True I had my chance
True true true I had those wild charms for you
And oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
My fire burned them out
But we will not be moved by it
We will not be moved by it

Your mind would never ache
When you were young and sound
The way your heart aches now
Your fevers send them all to round
Love love love till you've got enough
Dance dance dance if you've got no love around you
Love love love till you've got enough
Dance dance dance till there's no one left to hound you
We will not be moved by it
We will not be moved by it
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Love love love till you've got enough
Dance dance dance if you've got no love around you
Love love love till you've got enough
Dance dance dance till there's no one left to hound you
We will not be moved by it
We will not be moved by it
We will not be moved by it
We will not be moved by itEmbed
