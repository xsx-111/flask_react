Heart Is a Beating Drum LyricsLooking in the mirror
Looking back
A look of wild living
Bound to crack
The heart is a beating drum
The heart is a beating drum
It takes more than you wanted before
To keep it on
Howling at the future
Won't you be fast and full
All the noise and hot crossed fangs
You, you got in you
Send your love in a rampage
Give her everything you've got
And when you come to hate her
Show her more than just a spark
Cause the heart is a beating drum
The heart is a beating drum
It takes more than you wanted before
To keep it on, it's a beating
The heart is a beating drum
The heart is a beating drum
It takes more than you wanted before
To keep it on, it's a beating drum
And you feel like you been here
So many times before
It's not the door you're using
But the way you're walking through it
If you feel like you been here
So many times before
It's not the door you're using
But the way you're walking through it
Cause the heart is a beating drum
The heart is a beating drum
It takes more than you wanted before
To keep it on, it's a beating
The heart is a beating drum
The heart is a beating drum
It takes more than you wanted before
To keep it on
It takes more than you wanted before
To keep it onEmbed
