Dashboard Lyrics
Well, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted
But we still have the radio
Oh, it should've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
Well, you told me about nowhere
Well it sounds like someplace I'd like to go
Oh, it could've been, should've been
Worse than you would ever know
Well, the windshield was broken
But I love the fresh air you know
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know, oh!
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Oh, we talked about nothing
Which was more than I wanted you to know-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we go!
Oh! It would've been, could've been
Worse than it had even gone
Well, the car was on blocks
But I was already where I want
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Why should we ever even ever really even get to know?
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Oh if the world don't like us
It'll shake us just like we were a co-oh-oh-oh-old
Now here we go!
Well we scheme and we scheme but would always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each East and West horizon
Every dawn one yells "Surprise"
And in the evening one's consoling
Saying "See it wasn't quite as bad as"

Well, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
I was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes
After you had proved my point wrong
It wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh. oh-oh-oh
I just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show

Yeah, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio
(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)
Hard-wired to conceive, so much we had to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants
Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, we could've been, should've been
Worse than you would ever know
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, you told me about nowhere
Well it sounds like the place I'd like to go-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we go!
Well we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each East and West horizon
Every dawn one yells "Surprise"
And in the evening one's consoling
Saying "See it wasn't quite as bad as"

Oh it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know!15Embed
