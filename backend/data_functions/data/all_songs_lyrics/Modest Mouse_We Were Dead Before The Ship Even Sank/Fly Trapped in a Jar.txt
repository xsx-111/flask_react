Fly Trapped in a Jar Lyrics
Of part and parcel
Well, we're already dead
Well, it's probably been said
That it's always been said that

One wing isn't even enough
It isn't even enough
It isn't even enough to leave
One wing isn't even enough
It isn't even enough
It isn't even enough to leave

I'm gonna shake myself right out the door
I'm gonna take myself when it's finally over
I'm gonna let my own bad self take over
I'm gonna move my arm out with my shoulder

One wing wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough to leave
One wing wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough to leave
One wing wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough to leave

First off Gary was on trial and drunk before we left bed
As things got bad, it wasn't hard to say that he had no idea
Well, I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed
That they really didn't want us around
So we all just opened up our mouths and wallets to this town
Well, I was walking just a little bit sideways
And you were walking sideways too
Well, I hadn't learned when a front door can be used, here we go sir
We had docked in dark so we didn't read what the sign read
Though simple enough, it was demure and tough:
"The ground needs to be fed"
Well, I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed
That they really didn't want us around
So not a single one of us will ever leave town, here we go sir
Our bodies were laid out evenly for fifteen yards
Well, two feet above each of our heads was a fly trapped in a jar
Well, I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed
That they really didn't want us around
So every single one of us fed the ground, here we go now

One wing wasn't even enough
One wing wasn't even enough

All part and parcel
Well it's probably been said
That it's always been said
We were already deadEmbed
