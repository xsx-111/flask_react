Invisible Lyrics
Oh, well listen, dance and shift, you got a strong cellphone arm
Well, you're not invisible inside your car
No matter what consuming sort of mission you're on
Well, you're not invisible inside your car
I'm so absolutely mental, gonna ramble and charge
Well, you're not invisible inside your car
No matter, you should breathe it like your flies in a jar
Yeah, you're not invisible

I like the saline tea
Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and forth away from me
I should just let it be
Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and forth away from me
And it's sad--
Oh, it had to happen sometime, gonna shake like a charm
Well, you weren't invisible not all along
No matter how many eons came and are gone
We were not invisible, I knew that

I like the saline tea
Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and forth away from me
And there's the orphan sea
We were never invisible but that I guess we did not see
Of course this all had been laid down
Way before we laid down for it all
Before we had a course, of course
Of course this all had been laid down
Of course we lay down, of course we laid down
Of course we laid down
Of course we laid down, of course we laid down
Of course we laid down

I like the saline tea
Well, it's true that the moon can pull it back and forth away from me
And like the orphan sea
Well we were never invisible but that I guess we did not see

We'll get crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
Crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
Crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
Crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wetEmbed
