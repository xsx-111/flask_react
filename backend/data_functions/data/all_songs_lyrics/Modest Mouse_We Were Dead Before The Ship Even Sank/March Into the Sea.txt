March Into the Sea Lyrics
If food needed pleasing
You'd suck all the seasoning off
Suck it off
Well, treat me like disease
Like the rats and the fleas
A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha!
Bang your head like a gong
'Cause it's filled with all wrong
A-ha-ha, clang-clang-clang!

If you think you know enough to know
You know we've had enough
And if you think you don't, you probably will
Our tails wagged and then fell off
But we just turned back, marched into the sea

Well, treat me like the sea
Oh so salty and mean
Ah-ha-ha, oh-ha-ha!
Well, treat me like disease
Like the rats and the fleas
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
I'll be beating my heart's record for speeding
I'll be beating the record for hearts skipping
In the dark, our tails wagged, then fell off
But we just turned back, marched into the sea
Well, we just turned 'round, marched into the sea

Take all that you need
Like my sign says, "For free"
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Well, discard whom you please
Like the leaves off a tree
A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha
Let's shake hands if you want
But soon both hands are gone
Oh-ha-ha, ha-ha!

Well, treat me like the sea
Oh so salty and mean
A-ha-ha
Oh, treat me like the sea
Oh so salty and mean
A-ha-ha
Well, treat me like disease
Like the rats and the fleas
Bang your head like a gong
'Cause you called it all wrong
Move your tongue
Clang-clang, clang-clang, clang-clang, clang-clang!
Cut me down like the trees
Like the lumber or weeds
Drag me out of the sea
And then teach me to breathe
Give me forced health
'Til I wish death on myself
Give me forced health
'Til I wish death on myself
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha!
Well, we all stumbled 'round
Tangled up in our cords
From the phones, VCRs
And our worldly woes
Ah-ha-ha
March on, march on, march on, march on
Well, march on!4Embed
