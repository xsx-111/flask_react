Education Lyrics
Call it education
It was somewhere in between
You gave me some sound advice
But I wasn't listening
After we had capsized
I could tell you how you thought
Well, I'm not sure if I'd laid to rest
On the ceiling or the wall

Not quite conversation
It was somewhere in between
You said everything is taught
And I listened patiently
All this dog and pony
We're still monkeys the whole time
We could not help from flinging shit
In our modern suits and ties

Our instincts, they were cringing
About how we lived our lives
It didn't seem we'd lived enough
To even get to die
All these dense distractions
So beautifully complex
Well, I love life's surprises so much
I don't want to know what's up ahead
Stubborn shouted and said
"I don't do what you do"
I don't know, couldn't really hear
Hardly if you hardly care, and you don't
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty
Oh, very well

Hardly education
It was somewhere in between
Oh, I hit the roof but I had
Aimed for the ceiling

Hardly education
All them books I didn't read
They just sat there on my shelf
Looking much smarter than me
Good old Nostradamus
He knew the whole damn time
There'd always be an East from West
And someone in there fighting

Stubborn shouted and said
"I don't do what you do"
I don't know, couldn't really hear
Hardly if you hardly care, and just don't
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty
Oh, very well
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty
I don't know anyway
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty
I don't know, couldn't really hear
Hardly if you hardly care, as you don't
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty
Oh, oh, very well then
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty
Oh, very well, then
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty
Oh, very well, then
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty
Oh, very well, then
Oh, very well, thenEmbed
