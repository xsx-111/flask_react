Spitting Venom Lyrics
We were spitting venom
At most everyone we know
If the damned gave us a road map
Then we'd know just where to go

Now let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off

Well you were talking soda pop
You talked it quite a lot
The opinions that I do not give
The opinions I ain't got

So let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off

Well, you were spitting venom
At most everyone you know
If you truly knew the gravity
You'd know which way to go
Well, let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off

My ears were pressing firmly
Right against your mouth to hear
When you tried to spit the venom out
Your words were not so clear
Now drop
Hold on to what you need
We've got a knack for fucked up history
Hold on to what you need
We've got a knack for messed up history
Well, we went downtown
And we sat in the rain
Well, look in one direction and wait for a train
Thought over, it's all over
I didn't know you kept track
I didn't know there was a score
But it looks like you're the winner; I ain't gonna play no more
It's over, game over
Well, we walked real stiff and our canes tapped the ground
You hit me with yours
And said "Pull yourself together"
It's over, oh, it's over
You can say what you want but don't act like you care
It takes more than one person
To decide what's fair
It's over, think it over

You were spitting venom
At most everyone you know
If the damned gave you a road map
Then you'd know just where to go

So we carried all the groceries in
While hauling out the trash
And if this doesn't make us motionless
I do not know what can
So to say
What a rotten thing to say, such an awful thing to say
I didn't mean to bite you, sorry
What always did, what always did
What always had to sling
So let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off

Let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off

Cheer up baby
It really wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
Cheer up baby
It wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
Cheer up baby
It wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
Cheer up baby
It wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
Cheer up baby
It wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
Cheer up baby
It wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
Cheer up baby
It wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
Cheer up
Cheer up baby
It wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
Cheer up baby
It wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
Cheer up baby
It wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
Cheer up baby
It wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had
(Cheer up baby
It wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had)
Cheer up baby
It wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out
The antidote was had2Embed
