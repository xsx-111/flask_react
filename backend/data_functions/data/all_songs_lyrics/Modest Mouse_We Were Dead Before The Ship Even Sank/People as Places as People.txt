People as Places as People Lyrics
To answer a question, it'll probably take more
If you're already there, well, you probably don't know
Well, we were the people that we wanted to know
And we're the places that we wanted to go

Cause you're the places that I wanted to go

Yeah, you're the places that we wanted to go
Yeah, you're the places that we wanted to go

You're the people that we wanted to know
Shouldn't have to ask, you shouldn't have to ask
Cause we are your real place
You shouldn'tEmbed
