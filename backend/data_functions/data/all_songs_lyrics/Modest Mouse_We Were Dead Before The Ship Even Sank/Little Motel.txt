Little Motel Lyrics
I hope that you like it in your little motel
And I hope that the suite sleeps and suits you well
Well, I can see it as time and a sight through smell and
That's why it's nice to be by yourself

'Cause that's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for, aren't I?
That's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for, darlin'

We treat mishaps like sinking ships and
I know that I don't want to be out to drift
Well, I can see it in your eyes like I taste your lips and
They both tell me that we're better than this

'Cause that's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for, aren't I?
That's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for, darlin'
We trade tit for tat like that for this
And I don't think that there was an insult that was missed
I can see it in your eyes like I taste your lips and
I'm very sorry

'Cause that's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for, aren't I?
That's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for, darlin'

Remainders of a shooting star
Landed directly on our broke down little car
Before then we had made a wish
That we would be missed
If one or another just did not exist

'Cause that's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting on, aren't we?
That's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting on, aren't we?
'Cause that's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting for, darling
That's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting for, aren't we?6Embed
