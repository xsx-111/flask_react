Florida Lyrics
Although we'd often wondered
It was no thing of wonder
The shit that flew from our minds
While wearing stains of fresh fruit
And riding on shoes of horse glue
On this ridiculous climb
With great tunnel vision
We'd built ourselves a mission
To ride on bullets inside
Oh, what a vain description
Of what we have been missin'
So why would anyone try?

It was always worth it
That's the part I seem to hide
And the busy ant empire
Put up the closing sign

I wasn't always cargo
I was once kind of my own
I guess I'll pack up my mind
Well it took so much effort
Not to make an effort
Oh, what a flawless design
It was always worth it
That's the part I seem to hide
And the busy ant empire
Put up the closing sign
Even as I left Florida

It was always worth it
That's the part I seem to hide
And the busy ant empire
Has all deserted hive
It was always worth it
That's the part I seem to hide

Even as I left Florida
Far enough, far enough, wasn't far enough
Couldn't quite seem to escape myself
Far enough, far enough, far from Florida
We were all drowsin' in cruise control
Far enough, far enough, wasn't far enough

I stood on my heart's porch thinkin'
"Oh, my God, I'll probably have to carry this whole load"
I couldn't remember if I tried
I couldn't remember if I took my brain out
Threw it so directly at the goal
I couldn't remember if Iâ€”
I could have my mind erased
And still not know exactly what I don't already know
Even as I left Florida2Embed
