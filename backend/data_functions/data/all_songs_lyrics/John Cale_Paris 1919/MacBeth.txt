MacBeth Lyrics
Welcome home MacBeth
It's been a long long time
And everyone knows you're here
It's easy to see they care
Banquo's been and gone
He's seen it all before
He took it and then he did walk it
He shook it and then he did rock it

And you know it's true
You never saw things quite that way
She knew it all
And made you see things all her way

Somebody knows for sure
It's gotta be me or it's gotta be you
Come on along and tell me it's alright now
It's alright, it's alright now
It's alright by me

Alas for poor MacBeth
He found a shallow grave
But better than a painful death
And quicker than his dying breath
You know it's true
You never saw things quite that way
She knew it all
And made you see things all her way

Somebody knows for sure
It's gotta be me or it's gotta be you
Come on along and tell me it's alright now
It's alright now, it's alright now
It's alright by meEmbed
