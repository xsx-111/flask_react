The Endless Plain of Fortune Lyrics
Old Taylor said
Old Taylor meant to cry - oh my
Field marshal meant
Field marshal went away again
Look out below, the tides
Lean heavily like wine
We are all innocent in spite of you and me

Then Martha went
Yes Martha went away again
Down in Transvaal
Where crocodiles and men fight on
They would have played all night
Even with loaded dice
It's gold that eats the heart and leaves
The bones to dry

Segovia watched
Gendarmerie and all that's all
The radio man
Amanda did you choose your tune
She walked away in time
She walked a crooked line
So gracefully she turned her head
And smiled awayEmbed
