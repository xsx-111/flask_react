Hanky Panky Nohow Lyrics
If the sashaying of gentlemen
Gives you grievance now and then
What's needed are some memories of planing lakes
Those planing lakes will surely calm you down
Nothing frightens me more
Than religion at my door
I never answer panic knocking, falling
Down the stairs upon the law
What law?

There's a law for everything
And for elephants that sing to keep
The cows that agriculture won't allow

Hanky panky nohow
Hanky panky nohow
Hanky panky nohow oh

There's a name for everything
And for elephants that sing to keep
The cows that agriculture won't allow
Hanky panky nohow
Hanky panky nohow
Hanky panky nohow oh2Embed
