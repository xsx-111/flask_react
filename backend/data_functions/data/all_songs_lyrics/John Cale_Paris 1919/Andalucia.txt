Andalucia Lyrics
Andalucia when can I see you
When it is snowing out again?
Farmer John wants you
Louder and softer, closer and nearer then again

Needing you
Taking you
Keeping you
Leaving you

In a year and a day to be sure
That your face doesn't alter
Your words never falter
I love you

I'll be here waiting, later and later
Hoping the night will go away
Andalucia, castles and Christians
Andalucia come to stay

You were lost
Once before
On a day
Much like this
When you'd made up your mind not to come
And I couldn't persuade you
Or wait till tomorrow
Or pass the time

Andalucia when can I see you
When it is snowing out again?
Farmer John wants you
Louder and softer, closer and nearer then again

Needing you
Taking you
Keeping you
Leaving you

In a year and a day to be sure
That your face doesn't alter
Your words never falter
I love youEmbed
