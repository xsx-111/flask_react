Burned Out Affair LyricsEverything was fine when all the girls were boys
And singing was the usual thing to do
Nobody was sad but the kids
The kids with the clumsy eyes
We burned and we looted and frightened ourselves
Before we learned mothers could haunt us with words
Split milk and childishness made scratches and cuts
On the cheap polished charm of the clumsy-eyed rats
So we stole magazines and some bikes for a ride
Those dazzling devices for Superboy's bride
We shot a few, we stoned a few and someday survived
To crouch back in corners, mind in mind's eye
Well I can't bring back, I can't think back, it's fading again
The tin boys and young girls all melted away
Well I can't bring back, I can't think back, it's fading again
The tin boys and young girls all melted away
Everything was fine when all the boys were girls
And singing was the natural thing to do
But when men become women that old thrill's not there
Just some tired old dolls with their burned out affairs
I can't bring back, I can't think back, it's fading again
The tin boys and young girls all fading awayEmbed
