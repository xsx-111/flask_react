Once Upon a Time There Was an Ocean Lyrics
Once upon a time there was an ocean
But now it's a mountain range
Something unstoppable set into motion
Nothing is different, but everything's changed

It's a dead end job, and you gets tired of sitting
And it's like a nicotine habit you're always thinking about quitting
I think about quitting every day of the week
When I look out my window it's brown and it's bleak
Out of here
How am I going to get out of here?
I'm thinking out of here
When am I going to get out of here?
And when will I cash in my lottery ticket
And bury my past with my burdens and strife?
I want to shake every limb in the garden of Eden
And make every love the love of my life


Found a room in the heart of the city, down by the bridge
Hot plate and TV and beer in the fridge
But I'm easy, I'm open, that's my gift
I can flow with the traffic, I can drift with the drift
Home again?
No, never going home again
Think about home again?
I never think about home

The light through the stained glass was cobalt and red
And the frayed cuffs and collars were mended by halos of golden thread
The choir sang, "Once Upon A Time There Was An Ocean"
And all the old hymns and family names came fluttering down as leaves of emotion

As nothing is different, but everything's changedEmbed
