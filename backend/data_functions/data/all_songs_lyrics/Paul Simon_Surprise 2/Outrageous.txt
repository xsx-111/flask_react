Outrageous LyricsIt's outrageous to line your pockets off the misery of the poor
Outrageous the crime some human beings must endure
It's a blessing to wash your face in summer souls just rained
It's outrageous that a man like me stand here and complain
But I'm tired, 900 sit-ups a day
I'm painting my hair the color of mud, mud, OK?
I'm tired, tired, anybody care what I say? No!
Painting my hair the color of mud

Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Tell me, who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Ah, who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
It's outrageous the food they try to serve in the public school
Outrageous the way they talk to you like some kind of clinical fool
It's a blessing to rest my head in the circle of your love
It's outrageous, I can't stop thinking about the things I'm thinking of
And I'm tired, 900 sit-ups a day
I'm painting my hair the color of mud, mud, OK?
I'm tired, tired, anybody care what I say? No!
Painting my hair the color of mud
Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Tell me, who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Ah, who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
God will, like he waters the flowers on the window sill
Take me, I'm an ordinary player in the key of C
And my will was broken by my pride and my vanity
Who's going to love you when your looks are gone?
God will, like he waters the flowers on the window sill
Who's going love you when your looks are gone?
It's a blessing to wash your face in what?Embed
