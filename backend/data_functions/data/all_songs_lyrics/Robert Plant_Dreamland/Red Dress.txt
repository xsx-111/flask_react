Red Dress LyricsWalk around my life
Keep your money in your hand
Look out where you're heading, mama
Don't go running blind
Shine lights, strut it out
Keep your ear right to the ground
Watch out now, the strange cats
When the strange cats come around
Mmm, pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl shakin' down
Keep your eyes wide open
Hold your head up high
You are not a stranger here
So much changes with a sigh
She would lend a helping hand
Do not turn your back on the lady
When the lady comes around
Mmm, pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl shakin' down
Now, now, now, now
Some would say that love is blind
I blame it on the moon
Some people say that love's unkind
They find it out of tune
Mama, mama, mama
Let's keep on dancing true
Baby, baby, baby
I'm dancing true for you
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty, pretty, pretty little girl shakin' down
Ooh, ooh
Dancing down on Main Street
When it's safe, do The Stroll
You have time to look around
Saw a dame in the hole
No one cares about the fool
Worth the fine of gold
His only chance to plan
When Satan buys his soul
Mmm, pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl shakin' down
Ah ha
Pretty little, pretty little, pretty little girl
Pretty little, pretty little, pretty little girl
Pretty little, pretty little, pretty little girl
Pretty little, pretty little, pretty little girl
Oh ah oh yeah
Ooh hoo ooh pretty little girl
Mama mama ma, pretty little, pretty little girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
