Darkness, Darkness LyricsDarkness, darkness, be my pillow
Take my head and let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow
In the silence of your deep
Darkness, darkness, hide my yearnin'
For the things I cannot see
Keep my mind from constant turnin'
To the things I cannot be
Darkness, darkness, be my blanket
Cover me with this endless night
Take away, oh, this pain of knowing
Fill this emptiness with light
Emptiness with light now
Darkness, darkness, long and lonesome
Is the day that brings me here
I have felt the edge of sadness
I have known the depths of fear
Darkness, darkness, be my blanket
Cover me with the endless night
Take away, oh, this pain of knowing
Fill this emptiness with light now
Emptiness with light now, now
Mmm
Darkness, darkness, be my blanket
Cover me with the endless night
Take away, oh, this pain of knowing
Fill this emptiness with light now, oh, with light now
Darkness, darkness, be my pillow
Take my head and let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow
In the silence of your deep
In the silence of your deep
In the, oh, oh, hey
Oh, mmm
In the summer, baby
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, in the summer, baby
In the summer, baby
Ooh, ah, ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Ooh, oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, ooh
In the summertime, baby
In the summertime, babyEmbed
