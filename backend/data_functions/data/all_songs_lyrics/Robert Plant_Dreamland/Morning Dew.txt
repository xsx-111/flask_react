Morning Dew LyricsWalk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
Can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
Can't walk you out in the morning dew at all
Thought I heard a young girl cry, mama
Thought I heard a young girl cry today
Oh, I didn't hear no young girl crying, mama, mama, mama
I didn't hear no young girl cry at all
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Thought I heard a young boy crying
Thought I heard a young boy cry today
Oh, I did not hear no young boy crying
Oh, I did not hear no young boy crying
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now, there's no more morning dew
Now, there's no more morning dew
What they've been saying all these years was true
Now, there's no more morning dew
No, no, no, no more
No, no, no, no more
No more morning dew
Oh, no more morning dewEmbed
