Song to the Siren LyricsLong afloat on shipless ocean
I did all my best to smile
Till your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
Sail to me, sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
Touch me not, touch me not
Oh, come back tomorrow
Oh my heart, oh my heart
Shies from the sorrow
I am puzzled as a newborn baby
I am troubled as the tide
Should I stand amidst the breakers?
Or should I lie with death, my bride?
Swim to me, swim to me
Oh, come and let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold youEmbed
