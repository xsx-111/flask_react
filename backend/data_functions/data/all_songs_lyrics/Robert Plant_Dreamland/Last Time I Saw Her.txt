Last Time I Saw Her LyricsLast time I saw her, she was running
Laughing, swirling high above the ground
People stop and check and watch her coming
Crazy little mama going round and round
First time I touched her, she was burning
Through a heat of everlasting light
Drifting through her fires, my ceaseless yearning
Flaming little mama, will you burn all night?
Hey, will you burn all night?
Hey, will you burn all night?
The first time I kissed her, I surrendered
Hands reached for the skies, no disgrace
Safe inside my love so warm and tender
Move me, little mama, take your place
Ooh yeah, move me, little mama
Come on, come on, come on
Ooh, will you burn all night?
Mmm, will you burn all night? Will you?
Will, will you burn all night?
Ooh, can you burn all night? Oh
The last time I saw her, she was running
Oh, rollin' and tumblin', fall on the ground
Mama always said she's got it coming
Crazy little mama, keep your dresses down
Crazy little mama
Crazy little mama
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy baby
Crazy little mama
Crazy little mama
Ma ma ma ma ma, yeahEmbed
