Win My Train Fare Home (If I Ever Get Lucky) LyricsIf I ever get lucky, mama, win my train fare home
If I ever get lucky, babe, win my train fare home
I'm goin' back to the border where I'm better known
Oh, your calf is hungry, mama, hey baby, I believe he needs a suck
Oh, your calf is hungry, baby, mama, I believe he needs a suck
Oh, your milk, it's turning blue, I believe he's out of luck
Hey yeah
Yeah oh oh
Oh mmm
You know you got me crawling
And the grass grows very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawling now, baby
Until the day I die
Crawl up to your window
Crawl up to your door
Crawl anywhere you want now, babe
I'm gon' crawl across your floor
Yeah oh yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Hey
Well, that's all right, mama, baby, that's all right for you
Oh, that's all right, babe, oh mama, that's all right for you
Keep it low down dirty any old way you do
Yeah
Well well well oh
You know you got me crawlin' now, baby
The grass grows very high
I'm just gon' keep on crawlin' now, baby
Until the day I die
Wanna crawl up to your window
Crawl up to your door
I'll crawl anyway you want now, baby
Gonna crawl across your floor
Crawl across your floorEmbed
