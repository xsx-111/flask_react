Dirt in a Hole LyricsThe preacher bowed and turned to go
He threw some dirt into a hole
He wasn't needed anymore, oh
He shrugged and cast away the cold
He rearranged his preacher's clothes
The word of God is all he knows
Precious boy so young and fair
Guarding castles in the air
Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away
(Message from heaven)
Sun in the sky
(Message from heaven)
News from on high
God bless the soldier and his gun
Small sacrifice, then justice done
He's every broken mother's son
Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away
(Message from heaven)
Sun in the sky
(Message from heaven)
News from on high
(Message from heaven)
Sun in the sky
(Message from heaven)
Oh, yeah
Message from heaven
Message from heaven
Message from heaven
He threw some words into the air
He spoke the pain we all must share
How we will meet again out there
Precious boy so young and fair
Guarding castles in the air
Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away
Precious boy so young and fair
Guarding castles in the air
Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away
Oh, ooh
Ah, oohEmbed
