Left Outside Alone Lyrics
All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay I don't feel safe, I don't feel safe

Left broken, empty and in despair
Wanna breathe, can't find air
Thought you were sent from up above
But you and me never had love
So much more I have to say
Help me find a way

And I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone

I tell you, all my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay, I don't feel safe
I need to pray
Why do you play me like a game?
Always someone else to blame
Careless, helpless little man
Someday I might understand
There's not much more to say
But I hope you find a way

Still, I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone

I tell you, all my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not OK, I don't feel safe
I need to pray

Heavenly father
Please, heavenly father (save me)
Oh, save me
And I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone
I said, I said, I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone

All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not OK, I don't feel safe
I need to pray2Embed
