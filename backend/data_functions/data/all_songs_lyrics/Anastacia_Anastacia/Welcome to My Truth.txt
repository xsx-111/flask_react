Welcome to My Truth Lyrics
Sentimental days
In a misty clouded haze
I'm a memory that now feels untrue
I used to feel disguised
Now I leave the mask behind
Painting pictures that aren't so blue
The pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned

Somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see
(Don't you feel sorry for me)
My life turned around
But I'm still living my dreams
(Yes, it's true I've been)
I've been through it all
I've hit about a million walls
Welcome to my truth... I still love
Welcome to my truth... I still love

Tangled in a web
With a pain hard to forget
That was a time that I've now put to rest
Oh, the pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned
Somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see
(Don't you feel sorry for me)
My life turned around
But I'm still living my dreams
(Yes, it's true I've been)
I've been through it all
I've hit about a million walls
Welcome to my truth... I still love
Welcome to my truth... I still love

Sentimental days
In a mist of clouded haze
I'm a memory that now feels untrue

Somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see
(Don't you feel sorry for me)
My life turned around
But I'm still living my dreams
(Yes, it's true I've been)
I've been through it all
I've hit about a million walls
Welcome to my truth... I still love
Welcome to my truth... I still loveEmbed
