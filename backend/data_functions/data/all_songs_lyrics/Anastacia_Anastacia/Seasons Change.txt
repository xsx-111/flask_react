Seasons Change Lyrics
Cradle the weight of your life
You can survive what lies before you
It's only a matter of time
Before the night turns into day
Oh, it should feel incredible, oh
To know you're not alone, uh
Just look in my eyes (just look in my eyes)
Oh, just look in my eyes
I said now...

Happy turns to sad
Sometimes life gets bad
Things get rearranged
Nothing stays the same
It just never ends
And here we go again
One thing still remains, uh
But the seasons, seasons change
(Come on, yeah, seasons change)
(Come on, yeah, seasons change)
(Come on, yeah, seasons change)

Are you scared of today, running away?
I can see through you, oh
It feels like an eternal haze
But it's only a faze, it's all in your mind
Oh, when you feel invisible, uh
Just know you're not alone (come on, come on)
Just look in my eyes
(Look in my eyes, huh, look in my eyes)
Just look in my eyes
Happy turns to sad
And sometimes life gets bad
Things get rearranged
I said nothing stays the same
It just never ends
And here we go again
One thing still remains, uh
But the seasons, seasons change

You can feel the air start to change
When you're walkin' out in the rain
And the colors inside your brain start fading
'Til the winter is washed away
And nothing really feels the same
When sunlight's in your eyes you feel alive
What I really want (that's what I really want)
What I really want (that's what I really want)
What I really want (that's what I really want)
What I really want (that's what I really want)
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Happy turns to sad
Sometimes life gets bad
Things get rearranged
And nothing stays the same
It just never ends (yeah, yeah, come on)
And here we go again
One thing still remains
The seasons seasons change
Happy turns to sad
Sometimes life gets bad
Things get rearranged
Nothing stays the same
It just never ends and here we go again
One thing still remains
The seasons seasons change
(C'mon, c'mon, yeah, seasons change)
(C'mon, yeah, seasons change)
(C'mon, yeah, seasons change)
The seasons seasons change
(Huh, seasons change)
(Yeah, seasons change, oh)
Happy turns to sad
Sometimes life gets bad
Things get rearranged
Nothing stays the same
I said seasons seasons change
It just never ends, here we go again
One thing still remains
Seasons seasons change (yeah, come on)
