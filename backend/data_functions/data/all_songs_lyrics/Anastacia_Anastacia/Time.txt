Time Lyrics
Time keeps runnin' away
No matter what's left behind
It keeps on movin'
Oh, time, time

They say timing is everything
But nothing you control
'Cause there's always tomorrow
But tomorrow never knows
It's one day at a...

Time keeps running away
No matter what's left behind
It keeps on moving
Tomorrow is not in today
And all of your yesterdays
Are only a matter of time, time

And the journey of a lifetime
Will begin with one step
When you're climbing up that mountain
It's so easy to forget
It's one step at a...
Time keeps running away
No matter what's left behind
It keeps on moving
Tomorrow is not in today
And all of your yesterdays
Are only a matter of time
Keeps running away
No matter what's left behind
It keeps on moving
Tomorrow is not in today
And all of your yesterdays
Are only a matter of time

Oh, time, oh
Come on
Hah! Oh, I said now

Time keeps running away
No matter what's left behind
It keeps on moving
Tomorrow is not in today
And all of your yesterdays
Are only a matter of time
Keeps running away (Time keeps running away)
No matter what's left behind
It keeps on moving
I said tomorrow is not in today
And all of your yesterdays
Are only a matter of time
Time keeps running away
No matter what's left behind
It keeps on moving
Tomorrow is not in today
And all of your yesterdays
Are only a matter of time
Time keeps running away, running away
Time keeps running away
