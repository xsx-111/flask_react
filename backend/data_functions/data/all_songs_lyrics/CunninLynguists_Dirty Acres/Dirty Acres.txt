Dirty Acres Lyrics
Look, Ice Cube said Laugh Now, Cry Later
It's sad to see us living like that till pine laid up
Not straight up about death or missteps
No regrets, just weed, sex, worldly patterns
I miss Vatos and Bless, I miss my sister
The other day my nigga was stabbed to death
I laughed with Step bout holy scripture
Holdin blunts bigger than his casket, growed amongst grass un-kept
Still smoking, bet he's still blowing
Singin with Sam Cooke about a change comin as we keep pourin
Liquor out for those that passed
It's killin our livers because we dying so fast
Low on cash, who ain't? Ain't no jobs
Either you slang, you make music or you detail cars
You cut hair, you sell clothes or you live on charge
I barely got enough bread to give a cell phone bars
Fuck puttin bars on paper, there's bars on the face of
Half my niggas, spark the Garcia Vegas and ride country
I'll be damned if they stealing my pride from me
Fuck the world, I ain't destined to die hungry
 {X2}
The lies, the pain, the truth, the hurt
The music, the soul, it's all in the dirt
Lay back and just ride
Lay back and just ride
Just ride

Yeah, enter my zone, blunts stuffed, 'nough for self
Brave in this world, putting up smoke for help
Peace pipe under the street lights, type of wealth
Greenery coats the scenery, my whip turn left
Right away from them rollers posted up at the corner
Schemin to meet they quota off of niggas with soda
They love to get 'em together like lime and Corona
Twisted, like my niggas still reppin they hood
Don't own a brick up in that bitch but swangin they wood
Going to bat for that? Shit, I wish I would
In the thick of it, only with my Kyn I stood
Make sense of it with dollars only if I could
To trade children and a beautiful wife for a crack pipe
Or biddin in a system, just missin the daylight
Or missin in a system of hustlin all night
Shit must have been aight in some point of our sight
Till in a fashion we rationed off a portion of life
Coastin into a future that we strive to make bright, uh come on
Coastin into a future that we strive to make bright, let's go
 {X2}
The lies, the pain, the truth, the hurt
The music, the soul, it's all in the dirt

Lay back and just ride
Lay back and just ride
Just rideEmbed
