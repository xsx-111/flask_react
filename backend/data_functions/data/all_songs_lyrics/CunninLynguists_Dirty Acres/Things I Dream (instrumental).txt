Things I Dream (instrumental) Lyrics(verse 1 - Natti)
Arctic perspiration, heartless and impatient
No angel just a devil from shoulder to shoulder pacin
Fillin my gaze with hate, eyes cold as Alaskan basements
Aim at rappin clay targets while labels move like the Masons
I hang around outside of their building amongst the vagrants
Dangerous as loaded stainless, Majority versus minority
Cool as Cube's bat cocked back at the Priority
Warning the flashlight cops to stop where they stand
As I proceed to beat the publishing up out of this man
I tell him get the fuck up
They yellin how could he stand?
I don't expect him to, bitch
I pound him close to the land
Louisville Slugger cover every inch of his noggin bobbin
With every strike, askin what Heaven like
The reverend might, when he visit that is
If his spirit is near it
But if you yell toward Hell he'd hear it more vivid
But I'm under slumber, you get it? to live it I'd have to let you all
(verse 2 - Deacon)
Once upon a time I seen it clearer than the bluest day
Got off in some crimes, seen that line turn bluish grey
Q&A with self about murder, pussy & politics
Word around hte world is money and I want all of it
WOrld crooked like St. Ides, eye's acknowledge this
Just ask them Virginia Tech college kids
While ya'll wait for apologies, I'm low like a fox
Get between me and yo rocks and I'll put yo ass in a box
I feel the odds favor robbin a world without God
Money's the language of humanity, gimme Visa cards
I need ya cash and ya car, before I smash ya facade
Orwatch this classic toy make you collapse to the sod
Under the yard boy
Since a child these thoughts lurkin in my shadows
I heard em placin wagers on how well I'd face my battles
Accelerate to adult, failed but never faltered
I'm standing upon rock that'd make powder out Gibralter
(verse 3 - Kno)
Fumblin with a sweat on my fingers, something impetuous lingers
Become infected with feeling so I'm electing this evenin
To end my life without reason cus I'm indicted for treason
Closin my eyes and I'm leakin, drag the knife til I'm bleedin
Cus its light that I'm seeking, feels only right that I'm meetin
With Jesus seeking redemption but he don't need my repentance
For he who feels my intentions sees that my deepest depression
Is feeding me to these demons that lurk and feed on my essence
The pain is deep in my chest and I keep repeatin my blessins
Ever since a meek adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
Parents repeatedly sentenced, heroin needles on dressers
They used to feed their infection, I can't repeat indescretions
So I pause for reflection, long for honest affection
And gettin lost in the music is only soothin for stretches
Cus if you knew where my head is, when I'm doing these records
You'd never listen to my music again, I can't let youEmbed
