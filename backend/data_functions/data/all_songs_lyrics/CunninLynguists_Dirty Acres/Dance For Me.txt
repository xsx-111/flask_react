Dance For Me Lyrics
"Dance for me," someone said
Emily shakes her head
Knowingly, gracefully
Emily would begin

She was a late bloomer, from Penny to Janet in a blink
Dreamt 'bout being Josephine Baker in the mink
Gold make-up like the Sphinx
Skin made to view
Body ornament, performances sensational
From rhythm relation to titillation through
Demonstrations of what she's made to do
She always told me that she wanted to dance
The only time she felt worthy of romance, damn
I tried to told her she was worthy a chance
But it's hard to talk to somebody in a trance
I just gave her a glance, enough to sang her blues
Be Pablo to paint her moves, be Langston to name her hues
"Emily dance for me," someone said, she curtsied and turned her head
She posed, with knowledge and grace she gave us a taste
With a look on her face that could be taken for dead

"Dance for me," someone said
Emily shakes her head
Knowingly, gracefully
Emily would begin
Are we crazy, deranged, to stand up for some change?
Dreams turn to schemes, which marionette pulls your strings?
Emily's enemy was Emily, feelin' me?
She only lusted the heel-toe kick to the symphony
And now she justified, cryin' rivers for sympathy
Which in end she finds out is simply misery
No mystery, her OnStar on destiny's roads
Ballerina wardrobe glowin' under the strobe
Twirlin' amongst dollars waitin' under the pole
For a slightly possible goal sometimes we sell out our soul
Can't help that, errrbody done felt that
Just ask your favorite artist whose heart has turned to pitch black
Ask some of these stars where they lost they sense of self at
Strictly being puppets in public is a setback
Yeah fam, that's Emily's energy
Errrbody's a dancer, I don't view you no differently, so dance

"Dance for me," someone said
Emily shakes her head
Knowingly, gracefully
Emily, she begins

She makes it rain with her tears10Embed
