Dirty Acres (instrumental) Lyrics(Verse 1 - Deacon)
Ice cube said laugh now, cry later
It's sad to see us livin like that till pine's laid up
Not straight up about death or missteps
No regrets, just weed, sex, worldly patterns
I miss Vatos and Bless, i miss my sister
The other day my nigga was stabbed to death
I laughed with step bout holy scripture
Holdin blunts bigger than his casket, growed amongst grass unkept
Still smokin, bet he's still blowin
Singin with sam cooke bout a change comin as we keep pourin
Liquor out for those that passed
It's killin our livers because we dyin so fast
Low on cash, who ain't? ain't no jobs
Either you slang and make music or you detail cars
Ya cut hair, ya sell clothes or you live on charge
I barely got enough bread to give a cell phone bars
Fuck puttin bars on paper, there's bars in face of
Half my niggas, spark the garcia vegas and ride country
I'll be damned if they stealin my pride from me
Fuck the world, i ain't destined to die hungry
(hook)
The lies, the pain, the truth, the hurt
The music, the soul, it's all in the dirt
(bridge)
Lay back and just ride
Just ride
(Verse 2 - Natti)
Enter my zone, blunts stuffed enough for self
Bravin this world, puttin up smoke for help
Peace pipe under the street lights type of wealth
Greenery coats the scenery, my whip turn left
Right away from them rollers posted up at the corner
Schemin to meet they quota off of niggas with soda
They love to get em together like lime and corona
Twisted, like my niggas still reppin they hood
Don't own a brick up in that bitch but swingin they wood
Goin to bat for that? shit, i wish i would
In the thick of it, only with my kin i stood
Make sense of it with dollars only if i could
To trade children and a beautiful wife for a crack pipe
Or beaten in the system, just missin the daylight
Or missin in the system of hustlin all night
Shit must have been a'ight at some point in our sight
Till in a fashion we rationed off a portion of life
Coastin into a future that we strive to make bright, come on
Coastin into a future that we strive to make bright, let's goEmbed
