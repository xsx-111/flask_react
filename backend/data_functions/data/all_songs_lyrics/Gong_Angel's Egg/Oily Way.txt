Oily Way LyricsNow you're here and now you're Gong
Now you're back where you belong
Meet the wizard of the keys
And he'll reveal the mysteries
Of Angels' Eggs and Octave Doctors
Radio Gnome and Love Projectors
Then he'll point up in the sky
You will see the Teapots flying
Down the Oily Way…
Down the Oily Way you slide
Through the inner space you ride
Lots and lots of Pot-Head Pixies
Ridin' round in Teapot Taxies
On the Planet Gong they say
If everything goes wrong today
Fill your Teapot up with tea
Come and take a ride with me
Down the oily way…

Oily Way
Oily Way - it's not the milky way
Oily Way - it's not the only way
Oily Way - it's not the English way
Stop !
Wait !
Hey !
Look !
High in the sky, the world you remember
Scenes that we dreamed of
Time for the end of
Hate !
War !
Death !
You big daddy in your big sick city
Gotta choose to loose your games now
Now you're here and now you're Gong
But this ain't me that sings this song
For we the Gong Band it's enough
To be the instruments of love
On which the Octave Doctors play
That we be one and all as one with Gong
On earth and find again
The joys of going around the bend
Down the oily way

Oily Way
Oily Way - not the only way
Oily Way - it's not the only way
Oily Way - it's not the English way1Embed
