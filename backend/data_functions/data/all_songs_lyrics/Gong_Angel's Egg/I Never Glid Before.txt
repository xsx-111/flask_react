I Never Glid Before Lyrics
The light gets stronger and all our eyes look
Yonder to see what's going on
But that's all right you'll soon be out
Of sight and surfing to the sun
The moonwheel's turning, the waves unfurling you're
Learning you're Zero at the centre of the whirl... pool
You're Aquaman, and in your hand is a watering
Can I now or can I not believe it leave it to be
The fun gods winking and we're all blinking and
Thinking we're sinking in the sea
You're in your glider, the tide you're riding inside her
Is turning with the moony like the skyâ€¦ boy

Okay, you're mister illusion
Smiling in all this confusion
Cos you're young today
Tomorrow start to play
I'd just like to say:
No I never
No I never ever ever glid before
I never - oh no

I never ever glid before
I never ever glid before
I never ever glid before
I never ever glid before
Last warning tide turning
Moon burning slow motion
Waves that you ride
Just to bolster your pride
If it's love that you're after
The craft of a hero
Will vibe at your side
As alone you may glide
With a tiny afterthought
Flashing as the planet calls

I never never glid before
I never ever glid before
I never never glid before
I never never glid before

I open up the veil and let us
Take a peep into the Moon
And diving deep we'll meet the whale
Who ate the captain's submarine
Who told the tale of pixies green
Send us kisses in the brain
And out-far planets never seen
Except by technicolour dream
I never never glid before
I never ever glid before
I never ever glid before
I never never glid before
(Never glid before)
(Well I never glid before...)
(Never ever three-four, two-four, five-four, seven-four)
(I don't think I ever... I don't think I have, did glid before...)
(Well I could have glid before...)
(I don't know if I glid or...)
Loser, maybe
Loser, maybe
Loser, baby
Loser, maybe
Loser, baby
Loser, baby
Loser, maybe
Loser, maybe
Loser, maybe
Loser, maybe
Loser, maybe
Loser, maybe
Loser, maybe
Loser, maybe
Lo- (Hup!)
Well that's another story
Now's the time to go and find a cuppa tea - see?Embed
