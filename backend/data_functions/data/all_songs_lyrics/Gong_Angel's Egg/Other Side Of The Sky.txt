Other Side Of The Sky LyricsShe is the mother of everything, and you are her egg!
To pass beyond the countless worlds
The eternal wheel
The ceaseless tides of selves
Ever passing away before our eyesâ€¦
All life's light that I've seen
All life's light that I've seen
All life's light that I've seen
All life's light that I've seen
All life's light that I've seen
Here before me
Turn and turn and turn
And turn and turn and turn
And over round and under round
I wander under round
I wander round and round
I wander...
Hare hare supermarket!
Hare hare supermarket!
Hare hare hare supermarket!
Hare hare London bus!
Hare hare ladies' lavatory
Hare hare hare hare hare hare...Embed
