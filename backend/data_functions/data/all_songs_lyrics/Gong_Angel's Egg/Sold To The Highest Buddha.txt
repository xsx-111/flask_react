Sold To The Highest Buddha LyricsI'm zero the hero
And my head has floated away in the sky - don't know why
And now this spaceship headin' for me
I thought I was lost in the spaces and now all these faces…
And still I can't tell if it's really a spell
Or exactly what's happenin' to me…
Look out, we're being invaded !
Hang on to your hat, we're being raided !
And Captain Capricorn, that's who's behind it
If nothing's there to find, you know he'll find it
Hang on to your head
Hang on to your head
Hang on to your head
Hang on to your head…
It's a hassle you know to make rocket ships go to infinity
And I'm so sick of God and these bishops that talk of divinity
Now my head's feeling strange and my codpiece is starting to tremble
And that head in the sky there is starting to look like the devil…
Look out, we're being invaded !
Hang on to your hat, we're being raided !
Demons of the mind coming to get you
Until you're clean, the devil won't forget you…
Hang on to your head
Hang on to your head
Hang on to your head
Hang on to your head…Embed
