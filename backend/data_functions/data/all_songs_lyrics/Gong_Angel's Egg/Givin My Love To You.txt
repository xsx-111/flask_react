Givin My Love To You LyricsI'm giving my love to you
Cos I only want to see you smile
You got nothing to lose
But the failure to choose
And you're turning into somebody new
Meanwhileâ€¦
Oh no, give a dog a bone
Don't come thinkin' through the door
You won't forget us
Cos we will not let you
Cos we're lovin' you more and moreEmbed
