Listen to the Math Lyrics
You've been famous since your birth
A silent one it was, 'till they told me, "It's a girl."
And everybody gasped
I know how to raise you right, teach you how to read, and your math, yeah, toys, spelling, names, alphabet, and how to be polite

You've been famous since your birth
A silent one it was, 'till they told me, "It's a girl."
And everybody said, "You and your atlas know it all."
Let the corners curl, 'cause if you go by night, you'll hit the coast for sure

It's a ruse, its a laugh
Experts, they agree, listen to the math
Australopithecine
Re-kindle your heart
These hospital machines are state of the art

I put down my middle name in the back of her book
And signed it just in case our work was overlooked
'Cause I got one more up my sleeve
I'll bring it out tonight, 'cause if I am the joke, then you're the punch line

It's a ruse, it's a laugh
The experts, they agree, listen to the math
Australopithecine
Re-kindle your heart
These hospital machines are state of the art
But it's the art of the state thats gonna keep me awake
I need a second opinion, Not a second to wasteEmbed
