Graves Lyrics
Pack your rations pack a watch
Change of clothes and a facecloth
Meet me where your mother lies
We'll dig graves on both her sides
And lay ourselves inside
A thousand suns will set and rise


Our hair tangled up in hers
Fingernails beneath the dirt
Sharing all her blackened brains
Our blood running through her veins
We're leaving as we came
Our bodies are one and the same

'Cause you traded me for the lump sum
You try, but I'll never be a gentleman
You traded me for the lump sum
You try, but you only ever treat the symptoms
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause you traded me for the lump sum
You try, but I'll never be a gentleman
You traded me for the lump sum
You try, but you only ever treat the symptoms2Embed
