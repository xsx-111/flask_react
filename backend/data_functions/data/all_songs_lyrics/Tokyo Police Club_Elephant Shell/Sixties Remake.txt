Sixties Remake Lyrics
Classics for the modern age
Sixties remake
Everything you've got in spades
Your collar bone, shoulder blades

Hey
Bite your lips, shut your eyes
Hey
Swing those chains and start a fight

'Cause you've got nerve
But we've got tact
Goin' back to the city hurts

Takin' to the streets at night
Home alone, tucked in tight
Everything you've got in spades
Your sixties remake

Hey
Bite your lips, shut your eyes
Hey
Swing those chains and start a fight
'Cause you've got nerve
But we've got tact
Goin' back to the city hurts

It's how I won and it's how I tried
I was 16 for the night
It's how I won and it's how I tried
I was 16 for the night

'Cause you've got nerve
But we've got tact
Goin' back to the city hurts
'Cause you've got nerve
But we've got tact
Goin' back to the city hurts1Embed
