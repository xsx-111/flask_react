Juno Lyrics
I've got a place in the arctic circle
I've got a place that I painted white
I have a home in the salty ocean
So right, so right
All of the lions in your bedroom
All of the tigers we ignored
Pulling the wool down over your eyes
Yes sir, yes sir

You and your soapy eyes called it off so late at night
But your hands on your heart, 'cause your head's always right
You and your soapy eyes called it off so late at night
But your hands on your heart, 'cause your head's always right

I'm gonna go back for the science
I'm gonna stay for the decimals
No one will ever know the difference
Same old, same old

Fine, you were right, this wound needs ice
Fine, you were right, this wound needs ice
You and your soapy eyes called it off so late at night
But your hands on your heart, 'cause your head's always right
You and your soapy eyes called it off so late at night
But your hands on your heart, 'cause your head's always right

Juno, you're tired
Juno, you're tired1Embed
