The Harrowing Adventures Of... Lyrics
The harrowing adventures of
You and I when we were captains of
Submarines made of steel
Discovering the seven seas
Fending off the giants of the deep
Pendants from hanging teeth

Your ghost did you wrong
When he wiped your spit on the tablecloth
I am here to fight
And light your blood in the dim moonlight
Two wrongs making right

Harrowing adventures of
You and I before our eyes lay on
Shadows cast in the night
Led me to your old home
Set the tables for two alone
Pass the salt, pour the wine
Cause I'm alright if you're alrightEmbed
