Saints Lyrics
I like all the different people
I like sticky everywhere
Look around, you bet I'll be there!
Hot metal in the sun
Pony in the air
Sooey and saints at the fair

Saints alive you're saying
Walk in squares
The hid are out
Out for the year
It's a lot of face
A lot of crank air
Eroding round here

(Summer's ready)
Summer is ready when you are
(Summer's ready)
Summer is ready when you are

I like all the different people
I like every kind of fair
In the crowd, you bet I'll be there!
Walking around
Going nowhere
Seeing sooey and saints at the fair
Summer is ready when you are
(Summer's ready)
Summer is ready when you are
(Summer's ready)
Summer is ready when you are
(Summer's ready)
Summer is ready when you are
It's a lot of face
Crank air
Walk in squares
In the sun
(Summer's ready)
Summer is ready when you are3Embed
