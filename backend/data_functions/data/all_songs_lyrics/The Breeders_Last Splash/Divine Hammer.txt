Divine Hammer Lyrics
I'm just looking for
Just looking for a way around
It disappears this near
You're the rod, I'm water
I'm just looking for one divine hammer

One divine hammer
One divine hammer

I'm just looking for one divine hammer
I'd bang it all day
Oh, the carpenter goes bang
Bang bang
I'm just looking for one divine hammer

One divine hammer
Divine hammer

I'm just looking for a faith waiting to be followed
It disappears this near
You're the rod, I'm water
I'm just looking for one divine hammer
One divine hammer
One divine hammer
One divine hammer
One divine hammer
One divine hammer
One divine hammer3Embed
