Shocker in Gloomtown LyricsWere you there?
Were you kicking?
Alive in aisle twelve
Gimmick of the century
In boxes and jars
And giveaway cars
He motioning for you
Twas a band
They were sickening
Arousing everyone
PS Dump Your Boyfriend
Promotional trash
Emotional bash
With helium balloons
So now tell me
How the hell did we miss it
Bared his ass for all to see
And no one got to kiss it1Embed
