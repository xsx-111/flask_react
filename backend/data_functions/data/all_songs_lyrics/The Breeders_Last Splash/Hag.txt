Hag Lyrics
Hag!
Coastal cut-throat!
You dirty switch!
You're on again

All night, all night, all night
Under the stars
Under their light
All over the girl
Only looks bright

You're like a woman
Hag
You're just like a woman
You're on again

But sometimes
Under the stars
Under their light
You're everything right
You're on again
Under the stars
Under the light
All right
All right4Embed
