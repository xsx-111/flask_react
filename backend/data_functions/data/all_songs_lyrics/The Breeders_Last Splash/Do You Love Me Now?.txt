Do You Love Me Now? Lyrics
If I saw you now
Could I look in your eyes?
Do you think of me
Like I dream of you?
Do you wish you were here
Like I wish I was with you?

You've loved me before
Do you love me now?

Does love ever end
When two hearts have torn away?
Or does it go on
And beat strong anyway?

You've loved me before
Do you love me now?

Come on back to me right now
Come on, come on, come back to me right now
Come on, come on, come back to me right now
Come on, come on, come on

You've loved me before
Do you love me now?
You've loved me before
Do you love me now?4Embed
