Invisible Man Lyrics
He's the invisible man
Count the bubbles in your hand
The summer sites and the southern skies

That's all that's left behind
The skies and a sweet caress
He's the invisible man
Catch him if you can

You're nowhere in sight (just imagine that)
Nothing excites you (baby, that's a fact)
Open your eyes
Look and you will find

That's all that's left behind
The skies and a sweet caress
The skies, the sights
And a sweet caress
He's the invisible man
Catch him if you can
That's all that's left behind
The skies and a sweet caress
The skies, the sights
And a sweet caress
He's the invisible man
Catch him if you can3Embed
