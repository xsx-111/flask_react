Head To Toe LyricsLike a road, you're somewhere to go
Head to toe, twenty three
What/Rock with me
Your face looks good to me
Your face looks good to me
Your face looks good to me
Head to toe
You're somewhere to go
Like a house
There's someone's home
Someone's home
Your face looks good to me
You're allright boy/You look right boy
Head to toe, you're somewhere to go
Twenty three
What/Rock with me
Your face looks good to me
Your face looks good to me
Your face looks good to me
You're allright boy/You look right boy
Your face looks good to me
Your face looks good to me
Your face looks good to me
You look right boy
