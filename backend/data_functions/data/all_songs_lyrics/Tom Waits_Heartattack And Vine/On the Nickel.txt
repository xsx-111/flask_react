On the Nickel LyricsSticks and stones will break my bones, but I always will be true
And when your mama's dead and gone, I'll sing this lullaby just for you
And what becomes of all the little boys who never comb their hair?
They're lined up all around the block on the nickel over there
So better bring a bucket, there's a hole in the pail
And if you don't get my letter, then you'll know that I'm in jail
What becomes of all the little boys who never say their prayers?
They're sleepin' like a baby on the nickel over there
If you chew tobacco and wish upon a star
You'll find out where the scarecrows sit just like punchlines between the cars
I know a place where a royal flush can never beat a pair
Even Thomas Jefferson is on the nickel over there
So ring around the rosie, sleepin' in the rain
You're always late for supper, man, you let me down, let me down again
I thought I heard a mockingbird, Roosevelt knows where
You can skip the light with Grady Tuck on the nickel over there
So what becomes of all the little boys who run away from home?
The world just keeps gettin' bigger once you get out on your own
So here's to all the little boys, the sandman takes you where
You're sleepin' with a pillow, man, on the nickel over there
So climb up through that buttonhole and fall right up the stairs
And I'll show you where the short dogs grow
On the nickel over there1Embed
