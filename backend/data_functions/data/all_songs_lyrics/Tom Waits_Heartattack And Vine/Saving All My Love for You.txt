Saving All My Love for You LyricsIt's too early for the circus, it's too late for the bars
Everyone's sleepin' but the paperboys
And no one in this town is makin' any noise
But the dogs and the milkmen and me
The girls around here all look like Cadillacs
And no one likes a stranger here
I'd come home, but I'm afraid that you won't take me back
But I'd trade off everything just to have you near
I know I'm irresponsible and I don't behave
And I ruin everything that I do
I'll probably get arrested when I'm in my grave
But I'll be saving all my love for you
I paid fifteen dollars for a prostitute
With too much makeup and a broken shoe
But her eyes were just a counterfeit, she tried to gyp me out of it
But you know that I'm still in love with you
Don't listen to the rumors that you hear about me
'Cause I ain't half as bad as they make me out to be
Well I may lose my mind, but baby can't you see
That I'll be saving all my love for you1Embed
