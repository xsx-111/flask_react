Downtown LyricsRed Pants and the Sugarman in the Temple Street gloom
Drinkin' Chivas Regal in a four-dollar room
Just another dead soldier in a powder-blue light
Sugarman says, baby, everything's alright
Goin' downtown down downtown
Goin' down downtown
Montclaire de Havelin doin the St. Vitus dance
Lookin' for someone to chop the lumber in his pants
How am I gonna unload all of this ice and all this mink?
All the traffic in the street, but it's so hard to think
Goin' downtown down downtown
Goin' down downtown
Frankie's wearin lipstick, Pierre Cardin
I swear to god I seen him holdin' hands with Jimmy Bond
Sally's high on crank and hungry for some sweets
Fem in the sheets, but she's butch in the streets
Goin' downtown down downtown
Goin' down downtown
It's the cool of the evening, the sun's goin' down
I want to hold you in my arms, I want to push you around
I wanna break your bottle and spill out all your charms
Come on baby, we'll set off all the burglar alarms
Goin' downtown down downtown
Goin' down downtown
Red Pants and the Sugarman in the Temple Street gloom
Are drinkin' Chivas Regal in a four-dollar room
Just another dead soldier in a powder-blue night
Red Pants says to Sugarman, said everything's alright
Goin' downtown down downtown
Goin' down downtownEmbed
