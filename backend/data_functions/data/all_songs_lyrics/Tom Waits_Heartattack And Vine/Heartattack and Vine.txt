Heartattack and Vine LyricsLiar, liar with your pants on fire
White spades hangin' on the telephone wire
Gamblers reevaluate along the dotted line
You'll never recognize yourself on Heartattack and Vine
Doctor, lawyer, beggarman, thief
Philly Joe remarkable looks on in disbelief
If you want a taste of madness, you'll have to wait in line
You'll probably see someone you know on Heartattack and Vine
Boney's high on china white, Shorty found a punk
Don't you know there ain't no devil? There's just God when he's drunk
Well this stuff'll probably kill you, let's do another line
What you say you meet me down on Heartattack and Vine?
See that little Jersey girl in the see-through top
With the pedal pushers, sucking on a soda pop
Well I bet she's still a virgin, but it's only twenty-five till nine
You can see a million of 'em on Heartattack and Vine
Better off in Iowa, against your scrambled eggs
Than crawling down Cahuenga on a broken pair of legs
You'll find your ignorance is blissful every goddamn time
You're waitin' for the RTD on Heartattack and Vine
Boney's high on china white, Shorty found a p-p-punk
Don't you know there ain't no devil? There's just God when he's drunk
Well this stuff'll probably kill you, let's do another line
What you say you meet me down on Heartattack and Vine?
Liar, liar with your pants on fire
White spades hangin' on the telephone wire
Gamblers reevaluate along the dotted line
You'll never recognize yourself on Heartattack and Vine
Doctor, lawyer, beggarman, thief
Philly Joe remarkable looks on in disbelief
If you want a taste of madness, you'll have to wait in line
You'll probably see someone you know on Heartattack and Vine
See that little Jersey girl in the see-through top
With the pedal pushers, sucking on a soda pop
Well I bet she's still a virgin, but it's only twenty-five till nine
You can see a million of 'em on Heartattack and Vine
Boney's high on china white, Shorty found a punk
Don't you know there ain't no devil? There's just God when he's drunk
Well this stuff will probably kill you, let's do another line
What you say you meet me down on Heartattack and Vine?Embed
