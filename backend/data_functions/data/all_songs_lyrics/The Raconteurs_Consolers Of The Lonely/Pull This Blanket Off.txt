Pull This Blanket Off Lyrics
Pull this blanket off of me
Maybe it'll help me see
The things I believed to be true
I'm paying for what should be free
But I don't buy what they're telling me
And I want to believe in you

It's hard sticking to your guns
When everybody's having fun
Makes me want to run, I don't know what to do
Not everything is what it seems
Maybe these boys don't have dreams
I can't blame them some dreams are worse than the truth
All right, good night1Embed
