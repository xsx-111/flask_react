Salute Your Solution Lyrics
I seem to think I think I got a little situation
So listen to me sister listen maybe you can help
I think I gave a lot of problems my consideration
But not for me, it always seem to be for someone else
Why all the people always seem to just be on vacation
What do I get from it I don't get anything at all
I'm like a trash can holding all the information
And every single time it leaves me feeling two feet tall
Salute your solution, now, salute your solution

I find myself just looking well beyond of my best intentions
Ignoring any kinda applause I might receive at all
All others seem to find a road that's tough to satisfaction
I find a ridicule that isn't cool for me at all
And if there's one little answer to this complication
Someone somewhere help me settle what is on my mind
There's only one I'm only taking getting and receiving
There's only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one
And I got what I got all despite you
And I get what I get just to spite you
And I got what I got all despite you
And I get what I get just to spite you
And I got what I got all despite you
And I get what I get just to spite you

I find myself just looking well beyond my best intentions
Ignoring any kinda applause I might receive at all
All others seem to find a road that's tough to satisfaction
I find a ridicule that isn't cool for me at all
And if there's one little answer to this complication
Someone somewhere help me settle what is on my mind
There's only one I'm only taking getting and receiving
There's only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one I'm taking
And only one4Embed
