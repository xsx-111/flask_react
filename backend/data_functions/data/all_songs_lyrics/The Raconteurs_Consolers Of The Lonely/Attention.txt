Attention Lyrics
Hey!
Now that you have my attention
What are you gonna do
You might have good intentions
But they're not coming through
You're very pleased with yourself I see
It's like a walk in the park
You aren't enlightened by anybody else, 'cause
You can see in the dark

Got a lock, got a key
Got some kind of vice-like grip on me
On a leash, by the reigns
Got a look that puts me in chains

I tried a subtle suggestion
A more direct approach
I can't make a connection
You're beyond reproach
No need for petty excuses
No need for thumbing around
I don't know what the use is
Or what you're throwing down
Got a lock, got a key
Got some kind of vice-like grip on me
On a leash, by the reigns
Got a look that puts me in chains

Do you love the reflection
Do you love the reflection
Do you like what you see
Do you like the attention
Do you like the attention you get from me
Hey yeah, hey hey
Now that you have my attention
Got some kind of vice-like grip on me

Got a lock
Got a key1Embed
