Consoler of the Lonely Lyrics
"Daddy, will you tell me the story about the chickens again?"

Haven't seen the sun in weeks
My skin is getting pale
Haven't got a mind left to speak
And I'm skinny as a rail
Light bulbs are getting dim
My interests are starting to wane
I'm told it's everything a man could want
And I shouldn't complain
Conversations getting dull
There's a constant buzzing in my ears
Sense of humor's void and null
And I'm bored to tears
I'm bored to tears, yeah
I'm bored to tears, yeah

If you're looking for an accomplice
A confederate, somebody's who's helpless
You're gonna find, you'll find yourself alone
If you're looking for cut-throat
Singing above note, looking for a scapegoat
You're gonna find, you'll find yourself alone
Looking for sympathy
I can get you something
Something good, something good to eat

Haven't had a decent meal
My brain is fried
Haven't slept a week for real
My tongue is tied
Light bulbs are getting dim
My interests are starting to wane
I'm told it's everything a man could want
And I shouldn't complain
Conversations getting dull
There's a constant ringing in my ears
Sense of humor's void and null
And I'm bored to tears
I'm bored to tears, yeah
I'm bored to tears, yeah
