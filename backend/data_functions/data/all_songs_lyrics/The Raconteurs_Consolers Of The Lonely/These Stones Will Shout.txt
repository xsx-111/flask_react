These Stones Will Shout Lyrics
Well you impress me so completely
I start obsessing to hear from you
Whatever you do, you do sweetly
It takes a lot to not take from you
You're not secure enough to tell me
Your first impression of all these clowns
So you'll be tricky enough to compel me
To take the lead and to speak out loud
Yeah

Speak to me and don't speak softly
Talk to me and let me know
Grab hold of my shoulder and tell me
Grab hold and do not let go
Grab hold and do not let go

And if you find yourself repeating
Some of those incoherent sounds
Just talkin' to yourself is cheating
You might as well stick your head in the ground
Yeah
Speak to me and don't speak softly
Talk to me and let me know
Grab hold of my shoulder and tell me
Grab hold and do not let go
Grab hold and do not let go

I feel compelled to just yell out for you
To say the words that you can't bring out
But I cannot do everything for you
And if I don't then these stones will shout
Yeah if I don't, then these stones will shout
Well if I don't, then these stones will shout
(If I don't then these stones will shout)

So if I were to just lay in silence
(If I don't then these stones will shout)
And see if you would take control
(If I don't then these stones will shout)
These stones below me then may become violent
(If I don't then these stones will shout)
And they will wrestle me, pester me, mess with me
(If I don't then these stones will shout)
Just tryin' to free your soul
Speak to me and don't speak softly
Talk to me and let me know
Grab hold of my shoulder and tell me
Grab hold and do not let go

Speak to me and don't speak softly
Talk to me and let me know
Grab hold of my shoulder and tell me
Grab hold and do not let go
Grab hold and do not let go
Grab hold and do not let go
Grab hold and do not let go1Embed
