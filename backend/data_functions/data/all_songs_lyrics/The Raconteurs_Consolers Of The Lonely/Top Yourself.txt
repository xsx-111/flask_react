Top Yourself Lyrics
How you gonna top yourself
When there is nobody else?
How you gonna do it by yourself?
'Cause I'm not gonna be here to help you
All right

How you gonna top yourself
When there is nobody else?
How you gonna do it by yourself?
'Cause I'm not gonna be here to help you
How you gonna do it alone
When I don't pick up my phone?
I'd love to give a dog a bone
But I'm not gonna stick around to help you
Hey
All right

Yeah, how you gonna stop yourself
When your man stops ringing your bell?
You're right between heaven and hell
And you're gonna need the good Lord to help you
How am I gonna make you see
That this ain't no way to be?
See you've been getting it all for free
Guess you better get yourself a sugar daddy to help you
Hey, uh huh, hey
Top yourself

Such a little girl, like a spinning top mama
But she's spinning out of control
Takes sleeping with a snake like you
To rip apart my soul, yeah
Yeah, rip apart my soul
Rip apart my soul, yeah

How you gonna rock yourself to sleep
When I give up my midnight creep girl?
How you gonna get that deep
When your daddy ain't around here to do it to you?
How you gonna do it alone?
And I don't pick up my phone
I'd love to give a dog a bone
But I'm not gonna stick around to help you
Yeah
All right, hey5Embed
