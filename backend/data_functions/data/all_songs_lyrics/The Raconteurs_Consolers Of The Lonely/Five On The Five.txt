Five On The Five Lyrics
It's a decision that was made between you and me
And the division that was lately this odyssey, believe me
I'm bad enough and I guess we're doing fine
But I'm scared of something more that is on the line

Well I got five on the five
And I been taking time, doing it all along
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
If we keep it alive
I'll ignore all the signs and keep driving home
Right back to you, yeah
Right back to you, yeah

Well, I love you well enough that I'll have you know
The day I found you, girl, you laughed like a stereo
Now tell me why you always wanna put on a show
'Cause you look nothing like the kids in the videos

Well I got five on the five
And I been taking time, doing it all along
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
If we keep it alive
I'll ignore all the signs and keep driving home
Ah yeah

Wooh!
Well I love you well enough that I'll have you know
The day you found me, girl, my laugh became stereo
Now tell me why you always think I put on a show
'Cause I look nothing like the kids
Yeah, I look nothing like the kids
Yeah, I look nothing like the kids in the videos

Well I got five on the five
And I been taking time, doing it all along
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
If we keep it alive
I'll ignore all the signs and keep driving home
Yeah, I got five on the five
And I been taking time, doing it all along
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
If we keep it alive
I'll ignore all the signs and keep driving home
Ah, yeah
Alright!
Wooh!
Oh yeah!2Embed
