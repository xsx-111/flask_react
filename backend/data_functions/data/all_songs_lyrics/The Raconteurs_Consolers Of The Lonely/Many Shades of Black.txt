Many Shades of Black Lyrics
Go ahead (go ahead)
Go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever's left
And take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
I can't say that it's been that great
No, in fact, it's been a wasted, worried year

Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Let it out (let it all out)
Let it all out and say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream
And shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah
Yeah, see if I care
And see if I stand firm or if I fall
'Cause in the back of my mind and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all

And everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black


Yeah, everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
So take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And you cannot take it back
No, you cannot take it back
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
