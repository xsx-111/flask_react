Rich Kid Blues Lyrics
Been having bad times and I've been paying dues
Got shoes and money and good friends, too
Always play to win and always seem to lose
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues

And I know what is going on
And I know, but I'll wait 'til dawn, yeah
And I know just exactly what is on your mind
Jumping back, I know if I'm still gonna lose you, yeah

But I'm wondering why, girl, did I ask your name?
And all the people standing by, I thought they're in my game
Love's just a story, a story without words
Words are almost never seen and never even heard

I know what is going on
And I know that I'll wait 'til dawn
And I know just exactly what is on your mind
Jumping back, I know it's all a rut, do you want me to prove it to you

Though my good times are just paying dues
I've got shoes and money and good friends, too
Though I always play to win, I always seem to lose
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues
I know what's going on
I know what's going on
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?Embed
