Hold Up Lyrics
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Had enough of these modern times
About to drive me out of my mind
And you know this too well
I'm holed up in my little cell
Yeah!

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Whoo!
Friends took me to a freak show
But I think I've seen it all before
Well, can I get a look at you girl
Maybe take a peek in your world
Yeah!

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Modern girl, you're so kind
You're gonna help me get through this time
Well, and you know me too well
You didn't break a bone, you broke into my prison cell

Hold up
Hold up
I'm holed up
Hold up
Hold up
YeahEmbed
