Motorcycle Bitch LyricsI gotta motorcycle bitch with a fast machine
Well she struck it rich and she's awful mean
Five forward gears and she's water-cooled
She sure looks crazy but she sure ain't fooled
She rides a bike like she rides a man
Just hold on tight and don't give a damn
Slip the clutch and gimme full throttle
Open your legs pass another bottle
She scrapes those pegs and she winds up fast
Hold on tight with your legs this ride could be your last
I never seen her brake I ain't never seen her mend
Ain't no mistake cos death is round the bend
She rides a bike like she rides a man...etc
Don't carry no freight don't carry no pillion
She's gotta Triumph V8 and she's one in a million
If you're lookin' for kicks better step aside
She knows all the tricks just watch her ride
She rides a bike like she rides a man...etcEmbed
