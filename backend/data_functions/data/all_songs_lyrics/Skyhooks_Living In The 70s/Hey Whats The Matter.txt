Hey Whats The Matter LyricsHey, what's the matter, what's the matter with you
Hey, what's the matter, what's the matter with you
I'm askin' you, I'm askin' you
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't have your cake and eat it too
I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you
You can't have your dope and smoke it too
You can't have your dope and smoke it too
I'm tokin' you, I'm tokin' you
Hey, what's the matter, what's the matter with you
Hey, what's the matter, what's the matter with you
I'm askin' you, I'm askin' youEmbed
