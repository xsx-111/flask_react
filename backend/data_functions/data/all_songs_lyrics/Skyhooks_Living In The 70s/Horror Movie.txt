Horror Movie LyricsWatched a horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Shockin' me right outa my brain
Shockin' me right outa my brain
Watched a horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Shockin' me right outa my brain
Shockin' me right outa my brain
It's bound to get ya in
Get right under your skin
Hit you right on the chin - oh yeah
It's bound to be a thriller
It's bound to be a chiller
It's bound to be a killer - oh yeah
Watched a horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Shockin' me right outa my brain
Shockin' me right outa my brain
The planes are a-crashin
The cars are a-smashin
The cops are a-bashin - oh yeah
The kids are a-fightin
The fires are a-lightin
The dogs are a-bitin - oh yeah
Watched a horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Shockin' me right outa my brain
Shockin' me right outa my brain
You think it's just a movie on silver screen
And they're all actors and fake old scenes
Maybe you don't care who's gonna lose or win
Listen to this and I'll tell you somethin'
It's a horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie and it's blown a fuse
Horror movie, it's the six-thirty news
Horror movie, it's the six-thirty news
The public's waitin
For the killin' and the hatin'
Switch on the station - oh yeah
They do a lotta sellin'
Between the firin' and the yellin'
And you believe in what they're tellin' - oh yeah
It's a horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie right there on my TV
Horror movie and it's blown a fuse
Horror movie, it's the six-thirty news
Horror movie, it's the six-thirty news
And it's shockin' me right outa my brainEmbed
