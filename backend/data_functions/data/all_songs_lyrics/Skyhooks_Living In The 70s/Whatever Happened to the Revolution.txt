Whatever Happened to the Revolution LyricsWhatever happened to the revolution
We all got stoned and it drifted away
Whatever happened to the revolution
I think it died just yesterday
Whatever happened to the revolution
We all got stoned and it drifted away
Whatever happened to the revolution
I think it died just yesterday
I think it died just yesterday
Well I remember back in Nineteen Seventy
The army wanted you and the army wanted me
There was a war goin' on we were out in the streets
Wearin' our badges and stampin' our feet
There's a hundred thousand people all on my side
We didn't care if we lived or died
Hundred thousand people going to make it come
Hundred thousand people had the man on the run
*Whatever happened to the revolution (8 times)
Everybody thought we could win with a vote
So the band went home without playin' a note
We forgot about that war but it still went on
I'm alright Jack see you round so long
I'm alright Jack see you round so long
And now today everyone's a bit older
We're gettin' richer but we're gettin' colder
We're lookin' for somethin' that just ain't there
And it don't mean nothin' to have long hair
So when you're ready to make a stand
Open your mouth and raise your hand
When you're sick of your parties and sick of your sweets
Get off your arses I'll see you out in the streetsEmbed
