Carlton (Lygon Street Limbo) LyricsWhen the sun sets over Carlton
And the moonlight floods the streets
All those pizza places and spaced out places
They all get on the beat
When the sun sets over Carlton
And the stars begin to shine
All those grey-haired writers and drunken fighters
They all step out in line
When the sun sets over Carlton
And the day begins to fade
All those night time junkies and long haired monkeys
They all pull up the shade
When the sun sets over Carlton
And the lights begin to glow
All those Divine Lighters and window wipers
They all put on a show
When the sun sets over Carlton
And you're out to make a deal
Check out who you're talkin' to
And make sure they are real
(rpt above verse)
Well Lygon Street's really got me beat
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Well Lygon Street's really got me down
'Cos I'm a poor boy on the wrong side of town
Do the Lygon Street Limbo
How low can you go-goEmbed
