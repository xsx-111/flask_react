Broken Gin Bottle LyricsYou're like a broken gin bottle, baby
You smell so sweet and you're razor sharp
Maybe you're herald, angel honey
But Sonny Boy done played your harp
You're like a sweet potato, baby
Taste much better than you look
Maybe you're a gas oven, baby
Take a raw boy and make him cook
You're like a Coca Cola bottle, baby
Shake you up and you blow your top
Maybe you're a good guitar, yeah
Play so cool and you blow so hot
You're like a jet plane, sugar
You scream so loud and you go so fast
Maybe you're a napalm bomb, darling
And every blast is gonna be your lastEmbed
