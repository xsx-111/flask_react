Toorak Cowboy LyricsHe gets his hair cut at Marini's
And he drives a Lamborghini
The finest thing that ever walked this earth
His flat is just divine
He buys yoghurt and buys wine
A million dollars is what he's worth
Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is
Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is
He dyes all his grey ends
And he's got lottsa gay friends
He is twenty-nine if he's a day
And he wears tinted glasses
And his girls have got tight arses
And if he's camp he wouldn't like to say
Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is
Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is
He'll be at the supper show on Friday night
Goes once a month just to make it look right
At interval he'll say the movie's a drag
As he gets a cigarette from his leather shoulder bag
Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is
Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is
Well he bought his first dope outside the South Yarra Arms
A whole matchbox full in his hot little palms
Nineteen Sixty-Eight and the scene was cool
And all of his friends knew that he wasn't a fool
He knows the antique dealers
And all those other stealers
I'll be glad when he goes overseas
My friends he don't do nothin'
He just ain't got no stuffin'
He's just another social disease
Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is
Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he is
Well he's a village playboy
Toorak cowboy yes he isEmbed
