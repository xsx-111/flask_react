Living in the 70's Lyrics
I feel a little crazy
I feel a little strange
Like I'm in a pay phone
Without any change

I feel a little edgy
I feel a little weird
I feel like a schoolboy
That's grown a beard

I'm livin' in the 70's
Eatin' fake food under plastic trees
My face gets dirty just a-walkin' around
I need another pill to calm me down

I feel a bit nervous
I feel a bit mad
I feel like a good time
That's never been had

I feel a bit fragile
I feel a bit low
Like I learned the right lines
But I'm on the wrong show
I'm livin' in the 70's
I feel like I lost my keys
I've got the right day
Got the wrong week
And I get paid for just bein' a freak

I'm livin' in the 70's
I'm livin' in the 70's
I'm livin' in the 70's
I'm livin' in the 70's

Za-za-za-za-zai
Za-za-zai
Za-za-za-zai
Za-zai

Well! I feel a little insane
I feel a bit dazed
My legs are shrinkin'
And my roof's been raised

I feel a little mixed up
I feel a little queer
I feel like a barman
That can't drink his beer
I'm livin' in the 70's
I've just caught another disease
I'm livin' in the 70's
I'm livin' in the 70's

I'm livin' in the 70's
Eatin' fake food under plastic trees (I'm livin' in the 70's)
My face gets dirty just a-walkin' around (I'm livin' in the 70's)
I need another pill to calm me down (I'm livin' in the 70's)

I'm livin' in the 70's
I'm livin' in the 70's
I'm livin' in the 70's
I'm livin' in the 70's

I'm livin' in the 70's
I feel like I lost my keys (I'm livin' in the 70's)
I got the right day
But I got the wrong week (I'm livin' in the 70's)
I get paid for just bein' a freak (I'm livin' in the 70's)

I'm livin' in the 70's
I'm livin' in the 70's
I'm livin' in the 70's
I'm livin' in the 70'sEmbed
