Walking Through The Park LyricsI'm goin' out walkin'
Walking down through the park
I'm gonna walk in the moonlight
Till the night gets dark
I'm goin' out walkin'
Along the old avenue
I'm gonna walk for so long
Till she won't know what to do
I'm goin' out walkin'
Walkin' down along the street
I'm gonna walk with Sally
Cause I know she can't be beat
Don't you bother my baby
No tellin' what she'll do
The girl she may cut you
She may shoot you tooEmbed
