Jealous Hearted Man Lyrics
It isn’t but two things
That I really understand
It isn’t but two things
That I really understand
Well you know that is a lying woman
You know boys and a jealous hearted man
Yeah I’m so jealous
When I go home my wife goes to bed
Yeah that chick on the yard go to roost
I heard what that man said
Yeah you know my dog jumped the fence
They keep saying he may be awful scared
I don’t play with nobody boy

Yeah when I was in the country
I only had two friends
Yeah that was a whistling woman
You know boys and a crowing hen
That’s when I found out the first time
You know my trouble just begin
Look here Johnny, I got bad luck

Yeah when I go home
My wife runs and goes to bed
Yeah anytime I go home mad
My wife runs and jumps in the bed
Yeah you know my chickens all go to roost
You know I heard what that man said
I’m awful mad Johnny
Yeah when I was in the country
I only had two friends
Yeah that was a whistling woman
You know boys and a crowing hen
That’s when I know for sure
My trouble just beginEmbed
