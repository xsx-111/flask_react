Deep Down in Florida Lyrics
Yeah, I be going down in Florida
Where the sun shines damn near every day
Yeah, I be going down in Florida
Where the sun shines damn near every day
Yeah, I'll take my woman out on the beach
And sit down on the sand and play

Yeah, I think I'll go back to Gainesville
Just to see an old friend of mine
Yeah, I think I'll go back to Gainesville
Just to see an old buddy of mine
Well, you know if we're not too busy
I believe I'm gonna drop over Newberry sometime
Well, hey, I'll be leaving here in the morning
I think I will be on my way
I'm going to give myself a plenty of time, boys
Well, I don't want to make myself late
Well, you know I believe
I'll go back down in Gainesville
And, and this time I'm going to stay

Well, I'm going down in Florida
Where the sun shines damn near every day
Yeah, I be going down in Florida
For the sun shines damn near every day
Well, I'll take my woman out on the beach
And sit down on the sand and play
I'm going to take pants out with me
Yeah, down in Florida
That's the place I long to be
Yeah, deep down in Florida
That's the place I long to be
Well, I'll take my woman out in the backyard
And sit down under the old orange treeEmbed
