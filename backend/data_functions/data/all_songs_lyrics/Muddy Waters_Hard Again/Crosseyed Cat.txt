Crosseyed Cat Lyrics
Yeah I'm so sorry
I got to leave my woman alone
Yeah I'm so sorry
I got to leave my woman alone
Well you know she got a crosseyed cat
Living with another man in her home

Every time I start to see this woman
He's in the corner growling or laying down
Every time I start to see this woman
He's in the corner growling or laying down
Yeah, you know he's too big to be a house cat
And he's too small to be a lion

There's something wrong
Yeah, I stop by my baby's house
He start jumping from wall to wall
Yeah, I stop by my baby's house
He start jumping from wall to wall
Then he's looking crosseyed at me
Sit back in the corner and licked his paw

Yeah, my woman got a crosseyed cat
Living there with her in her home
Yeah, my woman got a crosseyed cat
Living there with her in her home
You know I try so hard to do her right
But it seem like everything I do is wrongEmbed
