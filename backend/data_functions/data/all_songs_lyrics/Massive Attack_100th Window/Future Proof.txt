Future Proof Lyrics
Borderline case
Reinforced glass
Absent friends
Passport photos
An elastic past
Empty pocket
They think it is all
They think it's soul
All wrapped up on a swollen lip
He draws the warm pipe

Chemicals
Chemicals captured in winter's grip
Turn us on
Separate the leper
Hungry ghosts
Hungry ghosts
Another imprint
In borrowed clothes
We can be numb
We can be numb
Passing through

Blow blow blow blow
Borderline case
Future proof
Real thin air
Real thin air
Real thin airEmbed
