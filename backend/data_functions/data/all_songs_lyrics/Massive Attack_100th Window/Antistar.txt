Antistar Lyrics
Can you lick my wounds please
Can you make it numb
And kill the pain like cortizone
And grant me intimacy
How'll we split your chromosomes

Yeah more sweet narcosis
Yeah more sweet narcosis
(I'll turn a stone I'll find you)
Yeah more sweet narcosis
(I'll turn a stone I'll find you)

I turn a stone I'll find you there
Into reflected light I'll stare
You blind me with flash bulbs
And puzzle me with syllables

Back to sleep

My heads between my knees again
Got needle set to zero
And you can shoot me hurricanes
Don't spare me the details
My heads between my knees again
Got needle set to zero
And you can shoot me hurricanes
Don't spare me the details

More sweet
More sweet
Iconography fucks with me
You look great in bloodstainsEmbed
