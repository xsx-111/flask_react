Lasso Lyrics
Where would you go?
Not long ago, Iâ€™ve been thinking out loud
Why so suddenly? D-d-don't you know?
Don't do it, what you do, oh, what you do to me
Forever is a long, long time
When you've lost your way
Trying to follow your ideal
Oh, sorry but your so-called life
It is such a waste

Wear your real eyes
No, you don't realize
What you say yes to
But you say yes, too

Where would you go, where would you go
With a lasso?
Could you run into, could you run into
Could you go and run into me?
Where would you go, where would you go
Tied up to a lasso?
Could you run into, could you run into
Could you go and run into me?
So lonely, so pretty, such a lack of diplomacy
You can't get out
D-don't you know? Oh, don't do it
What you do well, you should do to me
Far out, so far out, such a fallout
Not only that you're lonely
Don't matter if you're not so well (Not so well)
No, you're not so well

Where would you go, where would you go
With a lasso?
Could you run into, could you run into
Could you go and run into me?
Where would you go, where would you go
Tied up to a lasso?
Could you run into, could you run into
Could you go and run into me?

Wear your real eyes
No, you don't realize
What you say yes to
But you say yes, too
Tomorrow (Forever) is a long, long time
When you've lost your way
Tomorrow (Forever) is a long, long time
When you've lost your way10Embed
