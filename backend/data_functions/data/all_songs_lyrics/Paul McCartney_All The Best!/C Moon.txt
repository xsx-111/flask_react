C Moon Lyrics
Check, mm, check, mm, check it out
Mm-mm
Uh huh, mh-hmm
Was that the intro I should have been in?
Oh bo-bo-bo, yeah, yeah

C moon, C moon, C moon is she
C moon, C moon, C moon to me

How come no one older than me
Ever seems to understand
The things I wanna do?
It will be L7
And I'd never get to heaven
If I filled my head with glue
What's it all to you?

C moon, C moon, C moon is she, oh
C moon, C moon, C moon to me

Bobby lived with Patty
But they never told her daddy
What their love was all about
She could tell a number
That he thought of
But she never was the type to let it out
What's it all about?
C moon, C moon, oh, C moon are we
I said, C moon, C moon, C moon are we

How come no one older than me
Ever seems to understand
The things I wanna do?
It will be L7
And I'll never get to heaven
If I filled my head with glue
What's it all to you?

C moon, C moon, C moon is she
Oh, C moon, C moon, C moon to me

Bobby lived with Patty
But they never told her daddy
What their love was all about
She could tell a number
That she thought of
But she never wanted to let it out
What's it all about?
C moon, C moon, C moon are we
C moon, C moon, C moon are we
What's it all about?
C moon, C moon, C moon are we
C moon are we1Embed
