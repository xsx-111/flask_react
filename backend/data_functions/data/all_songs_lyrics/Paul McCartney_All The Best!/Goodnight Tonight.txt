Goodnight Tonight Lyrics
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, oooh

Don't get too tired for love
Don't let it end
Don't say goodnight to love
It may never be the same again

Don't say it, don't say it
Say anything, don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it, don't say it
Say anything, don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it, don't say it
You could say anything, but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it, don't say it
Say anything, don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it, don't say it
Say anything, but don't say goodnight tonight

Don't get too tired for love
Don't let it end
Don't say goodnight to love
(Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it
Don't say goodnight tonight)
It's a feeling that may never end
(Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it
Don't say goodnight tonight)

Don't say it, don't say it
Say anything, don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it, don't say it
Say anything, don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it, don't say it
You could say anything, but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it, don't say it
Don't say it
Don't say goodnight tonight


(Don't say no more, don't say no more)
(I say no more, I say no more)
(I say no more goodnight tonight)
Don't get too tired for love
Don't let it end (Don't say no more)
(Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it
Don't say goodnight tonight)
Don't say goodnight to love
(Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it
Don't say goodnight tonight)
It may never be the same again
Don't say it, don't say it
Don't say anything, don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it, don't say it
Don't say anything, don't say goodnight tonight2Embed
