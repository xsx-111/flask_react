Someday Lyrics
Fragments of a love
That's all we had
What we had was fantasy
Dreams and photographs
Hypnotic melodies could sing our song
A comfortable rhythm in a comfortless world

How do you know when love has gone?
There's so much more within me
How do you know that passion's gone?
I know I just don't feel it
How do you know when love has gone?
Oh, baby
How do you know that passion's gone?
I know we have to move along...

Someday you'll forget me, yeah
Someday you'll forget me
Someday you'll forget me
Someday you'll forget me

A fragrant memory is soon to fade
We lived a love of make-believe
Dreams and fairytales
And now we say goodbye, habitual romance
A rose without her petals and a song without a dance
How do you know when love has gone?
There's so much more within me
How do you know that passion's gone?
I know I just can't feel it
How do you know when love has gone?
Oh, baby
How do you know that passion's gone?
I know we have to move along...

Someday you'll forget me, yeah
Someday you'll forget me
Someday you'll forget me
Someday you'll forget me


How do you know when love has gone?
There's so much more within me
How do you know that passion's gone?
I know we have to move along...

Someday you'll forget me, yeah
Someday you'll forget me
Someday you'll forget me
(You'll forget me)
Someday you'll forget me...
Someday you'll forget me, yeah
(Someday you'll forget me)
Someday you'll forget me
Someday you'll forget me (forget...)
Someday you'll forget me
Someday you'll forget me, yeah
(You'll for)
You'll forget me
Someday you'll forget me
Someday you'll forget me, oh
Someday...Embed
