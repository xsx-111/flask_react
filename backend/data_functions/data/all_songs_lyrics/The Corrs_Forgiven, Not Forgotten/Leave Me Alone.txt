Leave Me Alone LyricsI'm alone
Hiding in the dark
I'm looking for a light to come and rescue me
I sleep
I rise
Hear your denies
Endlessly inside
It's crazy but
(Sometimes I feel like)
I want to run away
(Sometimes I feel like)
I've got to get away
(One day you will see)
Another side of me
(My life I command)
It's not the way that you planned
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Out on my own
(Out on my own)
Leave me alone
What do you want from me
Do you dream of a life?
Your life through me?
Myself
My time
In one we unite
I don't ever want to be that girl
You want it to be
(Sometimes I feel like)
But I want to run away
(Sometimes I feel like)
I've got to get away
(One day you will see)
Another side of me
(My life I command)
It's not the way that you planned
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Out on my own
(Out on my own)
Leave me alone
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah!
(One day you will see)
Another side of me
(My life I command)
It's not the way
It's not the way that you planned
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Out on my own
(Out on my own)
Leave me aloneEmbed
