Closer LyricsI see you
Walking everyday
With a smile beneath a frown
But I will not look away
Yeah hey
What does it mean?
What's there to see?
If I look closer, closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer...
Where you going?
And what you thinking at all?
Your eyes show nothing more
Than a dazed oblivion
What does it mean?
What will I see?
When I look closer, closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
Ah, yeah
You don't see me
Watching everyday
My smile could warm your frown
And I'd never look away
(Never look away)
There's more to me
Than what you see
When you look closer, closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
Ah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Closer
Closer
Closer
No, no
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no no
Oh yes
Closer...
Oh, no no
Oh yes...Embed
