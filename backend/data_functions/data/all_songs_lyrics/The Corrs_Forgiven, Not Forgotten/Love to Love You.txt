Love to Love You LyricsI would love to love you like you do me
I'd love to love you like you do me
There's a pillar in my way you see
I'd love to love you like you do me
I met you on a sunny autumn day
You instantly attracted me when asking for the way
God if I had known the pain I'd make you feel
I would have stopped this start of us, and turned upon my heel
Though you should leave me
Time make it be alright
Though you must leave me
Time will help you see the light
Oh, you don't need me
Time make it be alright
Though you must leave me
Believe me when I tell you
(Chorus)
You recognized my barrier to love
I know there's nothing worse than unrequited love (unrequited love)
So I prayed to God that I could give the love you gave to me
But something's lying in my way, preventing it to be
Though you should leave me
Time make it be alright
Though you must leave me
Believe me when I tell you
(Chorus)
(Chorus)
Break those pillars down
Break those pillars down
Take those pillars down, down, down
Oh, take those pillars down
(Love to love you like you do me)
Break those pillars down
(Love to love you like you do me)
Oh take those pillars down
(Love to love you)
(Love to love you)
(Love to love you)
Take those pillars down
(Love to love you)Embed
