Heaven Knows Lyrics
Deep, deep in our hearts
Strangers apart
Oh please come back to me
No more to leave
Never to grieve
I give my world to you

Send, send her away to her grieving
I will never set you free
No more, no more a life without meaning
You and I will fly away to

Love in my mind
Love in my soul
I just can't let go
Sadness fills my life
Of my foolis' plight
Only heaven knows

Tears, tears in the night
Sorrow take flight
Oh please come back to me
In each we believe
Never to grieve
I give my world to you
Send, send her away to her grieving
I will never set you free
No more, no, no more a life without meaning
You and I will fly to

Love in my mind
Love in my soul
I just can't let go
Sadness fills my life
Of my foolis' plight
Only heaven knows

Sadness fills my life
Sadness fills my life
Oh-ee oh-oh
Sadness fills my life
Sadness fills my life
Oh-ee oh-ee oh-ee oh-ee oh-ee oh-ee oh-ee oh-ee oh-ee oh-oh

Send, oh, send her away to her grieving
You and I will fly away to
Love in my mind
Love in my soul
I just can't let go
Sadness fills my life
Of my foolis' plight
Only heaven knows

Love in my mind
Love in my soul
I just can't let go
Sadness fills my life
Of my foolis' plight
Only heaven (knows)
Heaven knows...
(Love in my mind)
(Love in my soul)
(I just can't let go)
Heaven knows... no...!
(Sadness fills my life)
(Of my foolish plight)
(Only heaven knows)
Heaven knows...Embed
