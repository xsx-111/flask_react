Secret Life LyricsFrom red giant to supernova
Back to you and me
A cloaked entity within a virtual reality
Mechanised and organised
To me it's plain to see
The hand that's been busy weaving fantasy
It's so hard to understand
And often we are blind
But if truth were an ocean would it fit in the pool of a human mind
You're all alone
And it doesn't seem quite fair
Why we're all left in ignorance
Turning to despair (turning to despair)
Philosophy and theology offer us a glimpse
At something more incredible (incredible)
Than you and I
(Chorus)
So call on the secret life
Call on the secret life
Show me the way of life
Bring on the secret life
Evangelists, scientologists, and others I won't mention
Offer lessons in codology to all with good intentions
Listen at your peril, put your soul in detention
Resensitise yourself to this incredible dimension
When you're all alone
And it doesn't seem quite fair
Why we're all left in ignorance
Turning to despair (turning to despair)
Philosophy and theology offer us a glimpse
At something more incredible (incredible)
Than you and I
(Chorus)
I think, therefore I am
I think, therefore I am
And you're all alone
And it doesn't seem quite fair
Why we're all left in ignorance
Turning to despair (turning to despair)
Philosophy and theology offer us a glimpse
At something more incredible (incredible)
Than you and I
(Chorus)
So call on the secret life (turning to despair)
Call on the secret life (turning to despair)
Show me the way of life (turning to despair)
Bring on the secret life (turning to despair) (Repeat to fade)Embed
