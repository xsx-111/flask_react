Runaway Lyrics
Say it's true
There's nothin' like me and you
I'm not alone
Tell me you feel it too

An' I would run away...
I would run away, yeah, yeah
I would run away...
I would run away with you

'Cause I... have fallen in love...
With you, no, never...
I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love
With you

Close the door
Lay down upon the floor...
And by candlelight
Make love to me through the night
(Through the night)
Cause I have run away
I have run away, yeah, yeah
I have run away, run away
I have run away with you

'Cause I... have fallen in love... (fallen in love)
With you, no, never...
I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love
With you...
With you...

And I would run away...
I would run away, yeah, yeah
I would run away... (run away)
I would run away with you (yeah)

'Cause I... have fallen in love... (fallen in love)
With you, no, never...
I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love
With you...
(Da-ah ah-ah)
Falling in love (falling in love)
With you, no, never
I'm never gonna stop falling in love
With you...
With you, my love
With you...
With you...
Ya da da, ya da da da da
With you...
Ya da da, ya da da da da...
With you...
Ya da da, ya da da da da
With you...Embed
