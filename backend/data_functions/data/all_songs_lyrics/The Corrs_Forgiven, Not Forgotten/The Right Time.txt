The Right Time LyricsThis is the right time
Once in a lifetime
So I find it hard to sleep
Don't you know
The sun is shining in my window
Life's in flow
Making music in the morning
Laughter's light
Creativity touches
In full flight
This is the right time
Once in a lifetime
Keep it going, let's not lose it
Feel the flow
Oh oh, yeah
Flying free in a fantasy
With you I'll go
Yes I will
This is the right time
Once in a lifetime
Now something has entered my mind
Shattering all of my thoughts
It's no good, it's just one big waste of my time
But what can I do to recall
This is the right time
Once in a lifetime
This is the right time
Once in a lifetime
This is the right time
Once in a lifetime
This is the right time
Once in a lifetimeEmbed
