Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered LyricsI'm wild again
Beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
Couldn't sleep
And wouldn't sleep
Then love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
I'll sing to her
Each spring to her
And long for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
Ooh, bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I1Embed
