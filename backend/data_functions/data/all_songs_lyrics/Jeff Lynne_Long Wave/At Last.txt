At Last Lyrics
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song (Oh, yeah, yeah)
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known (Whoa, yeah, yeah)
And you smiled, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last
