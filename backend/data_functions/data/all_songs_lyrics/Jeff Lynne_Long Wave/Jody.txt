Jody LyricsJody, I miss you so
More than you ever know
And I'll wait
For Jody
Each year, you go away
I count the lonely days
Till you
Return in June
The leaves begin to fall
The summer I'll recall
Next year, we'll be alone
Forever
Together
I'll write you every day
I'll buy a ring in May
And I'll wait
For Jody
Jody, Jody, JodyEmbed
