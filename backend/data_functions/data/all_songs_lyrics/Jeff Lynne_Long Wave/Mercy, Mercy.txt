Mercy, Mercy LyricsHave mercy
Have mercy, baby
Have mercy
Mmm, have mercy on me
Well, I went to see the gypsy
To have my fortune read
She said "Man, your baby's gonna leave you
Her bags are packed up under the bed"
I cry
Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
Mmm, have mercy
Have mercy on me
I said, if you leave me, baby
Girl, if you put me down
I'm goin' to the nearest river, child
And jump overboard and drown
Don't leave me
Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
Have mercy
Have mercy on me
Well now, hey hey baby, hey hey now
What you tryin' to do?
Hey hey baby, hey hey now
Please don't say we're through
I said, if you stay, baby
I tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna work to a job seven days a week
And bring my money home to you (Bring it, bring it)
Well, I said
Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
Mmm, have mercy
Have mercy on me
Have mercy
Have mercy on me
Have mercy (Mercy, baby)
Have mercy on me
Mmm, have mercy
Have mercy on meEmbed
