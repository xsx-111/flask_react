If I Loved You LyricsIf I loved you
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know
If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you
But afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know how I loved you
If I loved youEmbed
