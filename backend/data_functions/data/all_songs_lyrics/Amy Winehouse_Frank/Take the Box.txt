Take the Box Lyrics
Your neighbours were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers
Hoping you wouldn't be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And I'd have wanted to stay
But I got nothing to say

You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say
Man, that was ugly

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
(Put it in the box, put it in the box)
Frank's in there and I don't care
(Put it in the box, put it in the box)
Just take it, take the box
Take the box

I came home this evening
And nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter
But that's not me, you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom
It smelled of you
Mister-false-pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye?
I think I love you

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
(Put it in the box, put it in the box)
Frank's in there, I don't care
(Put it in the box, put it in the box)
Now take it, take the box
Just take it, take it
Take the box
And now just take the box
