Rainy Day Women LyricsThey'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar
They'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you whеn you're riding in your car
They'll stone you whеn you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar
They'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat
I wouldn't feel so all alone
I wouldn't feel so all aloneEmbed
