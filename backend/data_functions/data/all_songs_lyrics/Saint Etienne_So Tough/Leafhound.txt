Leafhound LyricsI wish they wouldn't laugh...
I've been driving for some time and the towns look the same
This town feels very different as though I've been here before
This looks like the old school-yard where we both used to play
And the kids in that building, they look just like our friends
Something about this place makes me lose a grip on time and space
I haven't seen you for years but I feel you could be here right now
And I know it's strange, yes I know it's strange
That you could be here with me now
Days spent staring at highways, strange effects on the brain
I can tell I'm not dreaming, I know I'm wide awake!
I'm sure I saw the theatre that burnt down in '83
And I followed the Harley that had your number-plate
Something about this place makes me lose a grip on time and space
I haven't seen you for years but I feel you could be here right now
And I know it's strange, yes I know it's strange
That you could be here with me now
There's something about this place...Embed
