No Rainbows for Me LyricsI put off asking you
For so long
Afraid of what
Your answer would be
But there's no other way
So here I stay
You know, I believe in your lies
So easily
Ooh...
No...
No rainbows for me
I'm going for myself
(So I tell myself)
But there's no pot of gold
Just shades of blue
You think my heart's a toy
Like a little boy
Pick it up
Play with it
Break it when you're through
Ooh...
No...
No rainbows for me
Stop hurting me, baby
I may lose my mind
Stop hurting me, baby
Or I'll end up hurting you
Oh, why
No rainbows for me
Yes, well, that last one didn't sound too furious!Embed
