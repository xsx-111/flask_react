Orpington Blues Lyrics(And of course all this is pre-house nation)
Dream, dream alone
Make, make a song
You never talk of beauty now
You need somebody to show you how
You say you're tired, you need a rest
You just get stoned and get undressed
Dream, dream alone
Make, make a song
No one can tell and said: "That's all"
The pilot smiled and down the hall
You know we weathered and sailed the storm
Let's take the first plane to somewherе calm
She's your girlfriend's tail
I saw her long-rangе tales
Ribbons in her hair
Buttons in her nails
Dream along, dream along
Dream alongEmbed
