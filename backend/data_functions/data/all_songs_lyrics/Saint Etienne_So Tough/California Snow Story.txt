California Snow Story Lyrics
We've even had to change our name now, to "Revival"
Sing with a sound so soft / ??? you sang for me(?). /
Sing so slowly, / sing so softly. /
??? / ??? /
??? / ??? /
Pull back the blinds, / catch the falling snow. /
Twenty-first of June; / it's Christmas in my soul. /
Ooh... /
Slowly, softly, / softly, slowly, / softly, slowly, / softly, slowly... /
 I think I'll just / let the music play... /Embed
