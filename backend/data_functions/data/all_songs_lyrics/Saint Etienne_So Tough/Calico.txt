Calico LyricsDreaming that you are in my world
Wishing like a little girl
Watching closely you suddenly appear
Like a dream you're gone, then you're here
You take to emotion like a bird to flight
You drop an invitation, maybe I just might
Be your lover or better a friendly aquaintance
Truly as I duly pay my love to you like maintenance
Calico, Calico, Calico, Calico
Calico, Calico, Calico, Calico
You're realistic, your face conceal
Accentuate the passion, I will reveal
You're like an angel that delights with the day
I'm pleading don't ever go away
Story's reaching peak, the outlook is bleak
Please talk, say that you'll speak, you're strong and I am weak
I need the fortune at the end of the rainbow
I see you like a lantern, you have a certain glow (Calico)
Your smile is warm soft, forever appealing
Whenever you are present like a letter I am sealing
My love like a dove that blesses from above
The shower in an hour, won't you let me be your towel? (Calico)
Affection affects you like a weapon
You're extreme and supreme and nothing that you seem
A fateful chance with a twist of hope
I'll be with you all the way down the magical slope
Calico, Calico, Calico, Calico
Calico, Calico, Calico, Calico
Calico, Calico, Calico, Calico
Babe, don't be afraid, I'm with you everywhere
Gliding through enchanted waters to you I swear
Expression is the key, it's good enough for me
Cali can't you see, forever yours?
There's a feeling of warmth, a serious sensation
It's true, you have that good vibration
Your charm is overwhelming, you have reaches that I seldom see
Calico just let me be the one!
Calico, Calico, Calico, Calico
Calico, Calico, Calico, Calico
Calico, Calico, Calico, Calico
Calico, Calico, Calico, Calico
Calico, I see that we were meant to be going in...
I never take of my hat except when I'm out of doors!
She made a prize from Jenkins' ear
And washed it down with a bottle of beerEmbed
