Paper LyricsHere she comes
She's running over the hill
With her friend in tow
I know that it feels that there's no-one else on earth
Oh, heavenly days, you and me
Ooh...
Only love can mend a broken heart
There's a place that I've seen in my dreams
I'd like to live there by a golden sea
The only sound that I ever want to hear
Is the sound of her voice
Here she comes
She's running over the hill
With her friend in tow
Ooh...
Only love can mend a broken heart
Ooh... (only love,)
Only love can mend a broken heart
Ooh... (only love,)
Only love can mend a broken heart
Ooh... (only love,)
Only love can mend a broken heart
Ooh... (only love.)Embed
