Who Do You Think You Are LyricsWho am I?
I'm just a girl
Who only wants to try
To do what's right;
I'll never make you cry
But you're no good for me, and
Who do you think you are?
You tried to push me a bit too far
And every day sees another scar
Oh tell me, who do you think you are?
If you want me there
You gotta care!
Oh tell me
Who do you think you are (who)
Taking advantage of me this way?
Tell me, who do you think you are (who)
Hurting me more with the things you say?
It's not fair
You don't care
Who do you really think that you are? (who)
Where are we?
(oh where are we?)
We're at the cross roads and
I just can't see
(just can't see)
Which way to take
To keep you here with me
(here with me)
The lights are changing, baby
Who do you think you are?
You tried to push me a bit too far
And every day sees another scar
Oh tell me, who do you think you are?
If you want me there
You gotta care!
Oh tell me
Who do you think you are (who)
Taking advantage of me this way?
Tell me, who do you think you are (who)
Hurting me more with the things you say?
It's not fair
You don't care
Who do you really think that you are? (who)
If you want me there
You gotta care!
Oh tell me
Who do you think you are (who)
Taking advantage of me this way?
Tell me, who do you think you are (who)
Hurting me more with the things you say? /
It's not fair
You don't care
Who do you really think that you are? (who)
Who do you think you are (who)
Taking advantage of me this way?
Tell me, who do you think you are (who)
Hurting me more with the things you say?
It's not fair
You don't care...Embed
