Archway People Lyrics
You asked me to make a record of my voice. Well here it is. What you want me to say is "I love you." Here's the truth. I hate you, you little slut. You make me sick!
When you told me your dream (when you told me your dream)
I
Wanted to cry
You almost looked happy (you almost looked happy)
Please don't tell me
It's true
All our neighbours are old (all our neighbours are old)
Street-lamp buzzes all night
There are some nice parts of London, (there are some nice parts of London)
You can see them from here (you can see them from here, you can see them from here.)
You're
Not going to change
We're not moving away
We're staying here
(staying here.)
We're staying here
(staying here.)
We both work 'til late
Catch the fifty-eight
Usually asleep by eleven
(asleep by eleven)
But somehow it didn't seem right
When you turned and said
(when you turned and said)
"Let's go mad tonight."
So we drank and danced;
(so we drank and danced)
For once I felt close to you
(for once I felt close to you, for once I felt close to you.)
You're
Not going to change
We're not moving away
We're staying here
(staying here.)
We're staying here
(staying here.)
We're staying here
(staying here.)
We're staying here
(staying here.)
We're staying here
(staying here.)
We're staying here
(staying here.)
We're staying here
(staying here...)Embed
