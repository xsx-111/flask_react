Stranger in Paradise LyricsTake my hand, / I'm a stranger in paradise. /
All lost in a wonderland, / a stranger in paradise. /
If I stand starry-eyed / that's a danger in paradise /
For mortals who stand / beside an angel like you. /
I saw your face / and I ascended, /
Out of the common place / into the rare. /
Somewhere in space / I hang suspended /
Until I know / there's a chance that you care. /
Oh, won't you answer this loving prayer /
Of a stranger in paradise? /
Don't send me in dark despair / for all that I hunger for. /
But open your angel arms / to the stranger in paradise, /
And tell him that he need be / a stranger no more. /
Take my hand, / I'm a stranger in paradise. /
All lost in a wonderland, / a stranger in paradise. /
If I stand starry-eyed / that's a danger in paradise /
For mortals who stand / beside an angel like you. /
Touch me, / I'm a stranger in paradise. /
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, /
La, la, la, la, la. /
Touch me, / I'm a stranger in paradise. /
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, /
La, la, la, la, la. /
Touch me, / I'm sickEmbed
