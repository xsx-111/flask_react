Everything Flows LyricsWe get older every year
But you don't change
Or I don't notice you're changing
I think about it every day
But only for a little while
And then I feel it
I'll never know which way to flow
Set a course that I don't know
I'll never know which way to flow
Set a course that I don't know
The wind's blowing in my face
Lately find it hard to keep the pace
And I'm looking for a place to go
But only for a little while
And then the feeling
I'll never know which way to flow
Set a course that I don't know
I'll never know which way to flow
Set a course that I don't knowEmbed
