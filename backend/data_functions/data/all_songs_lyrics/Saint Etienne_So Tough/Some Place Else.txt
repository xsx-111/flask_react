Some Place Else LyricsYou can tell me a thousand times, or more, it's all in the past
But words just won't convince me, I'm smarter than that!
And any fool can see that even though you're here with me
Your mind, your mind, your mind is some place else
Your mind, your mind, your mind is some place else
I know the place, I was there once
But I don't think  I'll ever see it again
Your mind, your mind, your mind is some place else
Your mind, your mind, your mind is some place else
Since the first time I heard her name I knew we'd never be the same
And I know to who you say it, now it's started again
And any fool can see that you have given up on me
Your mind, your mind, your mind's on someone else
Your mind, your mind, your mind's on someone else
I know the girl who's in my place
And I know I can never face her again
Your mind, your mind, your mind's on someone else
Your mind, your mind, your mind's on someone else
(Your mind, your mind's on someone else
Your mind, your mind's on someone else)Embed
