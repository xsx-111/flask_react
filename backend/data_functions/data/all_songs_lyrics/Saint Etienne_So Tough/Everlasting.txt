Everlasting LyricsAnd here's the opening line
I believe you're gonna be mine
You know I've never loved before
But you're the key to open the door
I believe it's everlasting
I believe it's everlasting
You know I've never loved before
But you're the key to open the door
I believe it's everlasting
I believe it's everlasting
See the sun
See the sun
I believe, I believe
I believe, it's everlasting
I believe it's
And here's the opening line
I believe you're gonna be mine
You know I've never loved before
But you're the key to open the door
I believe it's everlasting
I believe it's everlasting
I believe it's everlasting
I believe it's everlastingEmbed
