Avenue LyricsOo-oo-ooh, young heart, oo-oo-ooh, young heart...
Pass me the suitcase, baby, I know it's not that easy and
Give me my mirror, love, just give me back my memories
And oh, oh, how many years, is it now Maurice?
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart, oo-oo-ooh, young heart
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart, and ooh-oh the clown's no good
And I was half-asleep, and riding on a slow-coach
I think I lose all these things still meaning I'm not holy
And oh, oh, your honey-dish, oh, it's on my list
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart, oo-oo-ooh, young heart
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart, and ooh-oh the clown's no good
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart, oo-oo-ooh, young heart
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart, oo-oo-ooh, young heart
And ooh-oh the clown's no good, and ooh-oh the clown's no good
(And then I shall go back to Maurice) And ooh-oh the clown's no goodEmbed
