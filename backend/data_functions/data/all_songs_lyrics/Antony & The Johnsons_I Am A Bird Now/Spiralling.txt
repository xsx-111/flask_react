Spiralling LyricsWell and I can and I die
I can, I die
Well and I'm freezing
I'm freezing
Well, it's a sly curse
A sly curse
Well and I'm spiralling
I'm spiralling
In my broken heart game
I got all my fives
I got all my ones to choose from
My cave
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
I'm ravage like a dog and meat
I'm gone, gone
In Carthusian Red I get cut along
I am
I am undone
I am undone
Where go?
Where now?
Can't stand
And if I can
Can die
I'm freezing
Sly curse
I'm spiralling
In my cruel love gold poisoned
I was born, born
Not a girl and not a jewel
I am
I am some son
I am some bum
Where go?
Where now?
Can't stand
And if I can
Can die
I'm freezing
Sly curse
I'm spiralling
Spiralling
Spiralling
Spiralling
Spiralling
Held brave Roäc
Held brave Roäc
Held brave Roäc
Held brave Roäc
Held brave Roäc
Held brave RoäcEmbed
