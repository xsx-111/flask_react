Free at Last Lyrics(North American Slaves Spiritual Chant Gospel)
Julia Yasuda :
Way down yonder in the graveyard walk
I thank God I'm free at last
Me and my Jesus going to meet and talk
I thank God I'm free at last
On my knees when the light pass'd by
I thank God I'm free at last
Tho't my soul would rise and fly
I thank God I'm free at last
Some of these mornings, bright and fair
I thank God I'm free at last
Goin' meet my Jesus
In the middle of the air
I thank God I'm free at last
Ladies and gentlemen
