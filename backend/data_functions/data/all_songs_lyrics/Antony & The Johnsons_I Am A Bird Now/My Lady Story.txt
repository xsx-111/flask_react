My Lady Story Lyrics
My lady story
My lady story
My lady story
Is one of annihilation
My lady story
Is one of breast amputation

I'm a hole in love
I'm a bride on fire
I am twisted in to a starve of wire

Lie in road for you
And I've been your slave
My womb's an ocean full
Of grief and rage

Still you're coaxing me
Come on out and live
Well I'm a crippled dog
I've got nothing to give

I'm so broken babe
But I want to see
Some shining eye
Some of my beauty
Lostest beauty
Lostest beautyEmbed
