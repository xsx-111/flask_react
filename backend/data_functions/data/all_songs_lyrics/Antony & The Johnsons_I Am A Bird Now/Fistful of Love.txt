Fistful of Love LyricsI was lying in my bed last night
Staring at a ceiling full of stars
When it suddenly hit me
I just have to let you know how I feel
We live together in a photograph of time
I look into your eyes
And the seas open up to me
I tell you I love you
And I always will
And I know you can't tell me
I know that you can't tell me
So I'm left to pick up
The hints, the little symbols of your devotion
So I'm left to pick up
The hints, the little symbols of your devotion
And I feel your fist
And I know it's out of love
And I feel the whip
And I know it's out of love
And I feel your burning eyes, oh, burning holes
Straight through my heart
It's out of love
It's out of love
And I accept and I collect upon my body
The memories of your devotion
And I accept and I collect upon my body
The memories of your devotion
And I feel your fist
And I know it's out of love
And I feel the whip
And I know it's out of love
And I feel your burning eyes burning holes
Straight through my heart
It's out of love
It's out of love
Give me a little fistful of love
Give me a little fistful of love
Fistful of love
Fistful, fist, fist, fistful of love
You're giving me a little fist
Giving me a little fistful of love
Giving me, giving me
A little fistful of love
Give me a little, little, little, givin' little
Givin' me a fistful of love
Give a little bit, give a little bit
Givin' me a fistful of love
Oh baby
Givin' me just a little fistful of love
Give me just a little bit
Give me just a little bit1Embed
