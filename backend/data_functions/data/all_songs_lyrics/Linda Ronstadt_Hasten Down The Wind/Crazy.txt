Crazy Lyrics
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling blue

I know, you'd love me as long as you wanted
Then someday, leave me for somebody new

Worry, why should I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?

I'm crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for crying and crazy for trying
And I'm crazy for loving you

Worry, why should I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?

I'm crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for crying and crazy for trying
And I'm crazy for loving youEmbed
