Try Me Again LyricsWell I drove past your house last night
And I looked in the window
Lately I ain't been feeling right
And I don't know the cure, no
Still I can't keep from wondering
If I still figure in your life
Could you take me back and try me
Try me again
Could you try me again
I drove around in this lonesome town
Felt just like a beginner
Friends I saw they just brought me down
They're so cynical and bitter
Well I guess I'm just like them now
I never thought I'd turn out like that
Could you take me back and try me
Try me again
Could you try me again
Well you say that I cheated
I was not what you needed
Well you're not being kind
When you say you tried
And you know you lied
My hands are tied
Woah, try me again
I'm gonna knock on your door
Till you say you'll come back to me
And love me some more
Oh oh try me again
Will you try me again
Woah, try me againEmbed
