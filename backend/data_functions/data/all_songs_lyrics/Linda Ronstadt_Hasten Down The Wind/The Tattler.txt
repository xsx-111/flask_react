The Tattler LyricsWhenever you find a man
That loves every woman he sees
There's always some kind of woman
That's putting him up a tree
Well that kind of man he ain't got
As much sense as a mule
You know everyone don't love you
They're just playing you for a fool
Oh no it's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can
Now if you marry the wrong kind of woman
And you get where you can't agree
Well you just as well forget your plan
Let that woman be
But a man ought to make a good husband
And quit trying to lead a fast life
Going about dressing up other women
Won't put clothes on his own wife
Oh no it's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can
Well there's lots of good women want to marry
And they want to live well at home
But they're 'fraid they'll get hold of some rowdy man
Can't let other women alone
And there's lots of good men want to marry
And they want to live well at home
But every time they turn their back there's a man there
Asking darling is he gone
Oh no it's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you canEmbed
