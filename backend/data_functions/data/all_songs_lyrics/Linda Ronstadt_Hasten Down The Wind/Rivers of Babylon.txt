Rivers of Babylon LyricsBy the rivers of Babylon
Where he sat down
And there he went
When he remembered Zion
For the wicked carry us away
Captivity require from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land
So let the words of our mouth
And the meditations of our hearts
Be acceptable in thy sight
