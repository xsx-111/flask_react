Depression & Obsession Lyrics
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Depression and obsession don't mix well
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
I'm poisoned and my body don't feel well
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
I ate her, inside and out, I feel my stomach turnin'
Make out hill, where we met we let our lips do all the talkin'
And now I'm hooked andâ€¦
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
Depression and obsession don't mix well (Well)
Hollywood motels, hell, I think I'm just obsessed with you
Depression and obsession don't mix well
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
Hollywood motels, hell, I think I'm just obsessed with you

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na143Embed
