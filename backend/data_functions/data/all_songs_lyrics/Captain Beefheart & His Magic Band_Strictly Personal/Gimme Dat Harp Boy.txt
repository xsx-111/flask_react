Gimme Dat Harp Boy Lyrics
Gimme that harp boy
Ain't no fat man's toy
You hear what he's saying
You hear he's saying today
Harp cry harp smiling
Shiny moon white note
Give me room
Ain't no time to rock no boat, gimme room
Harp sing time for playin' ohm....

Gimme harp, that harp, harp this, harp bite
Harp this, harp kiss, harp money

Gimme that harp boy
Don't just stand around
Gon' blow pure joy
Girl you wear this crown

Gimme that harp boy
Gimme that harp girl
Gimme that harp girl
Gimme that harp boy
Harp string, harp ring
Harp toke, harp smoke
Harp float, harp brokeEmbed
