On Tomorrow Lyrics
We're all brothers on tomorrow
(We won't have to talk)
We won't need to talk
We won't need to walk on tomorrow
Rush comes the love
Shapes to share the shapes
Love, love, love on tomorrow

Baby springs on yellow wings
Red skies showing on
Lively ivy growing on tomorrow
Wish your way around
Hair stingin' to the ground
Silver streams all our dreams

Cleansed, free of sorrow
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Lush skies above
Shapes to share shapes
Peace escapes
To play away
Today
Tomorrow
Mothers graze on grasslands
Grazin' woman stands on today's shiftin' sands
Grazin woman stands with baby springs on golden wings
Flies free of sorrow
On tomorrow (see them golden come)
(Sowing golden seeds)
(Growing free of harm)
(Growing free of harm)
Mothers graze on grasslands (Growing free of harm)
Pity for which it stands
We're all brothers on tomorrow
Yeah, we're all brothers on tomorrow
Yeah, we're all brothers on tomorrow
On tomorrow
On tomorrow
On tomorrow
On tomorrowEmbed
