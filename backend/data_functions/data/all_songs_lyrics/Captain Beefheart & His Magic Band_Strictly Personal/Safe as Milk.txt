Safe as Milk Lyrics
My cigarette died when I washed my face
Dropped some drops for an ashtray, hit a wrong place
Woman at my blinds to see spiders spinning lines
It's a safe as milk, it's a safe as milk
I never heard it put quite that way
The shape I'm in is-a worn away
They called a day, they called a day

Yesterday's paper headlines approach
Rain gutter teasing, rusty cat sneezing
Soppin' wet hammer dusty and wheezing
Lusty alley whining trashcan blues
Children running after rainbows stocking poor
Gracious ladies' nylon hanging onto line
Jumping onto leg, looking mighty fine

Sorrows lollipop lands stick-broken on a dark carnival ground
Pop up toaster cracklin', aluminum rhythm and sound
Ev'ryday pencil lazy and sharp
The icebox inside looking like a harp
Electric bulb been out for years (freezer!)
Freezer fumes feed the gas tears
Cheese in the corner with a mile long beard
Bacon blue bread dog eared
(Bacon blue bread dog eared)
Bacon blue bread dog eared
Bacon blue bread dog eared (bread dog eared)
Bread dog eared...
...I may be hungry but I sure ain't weird
