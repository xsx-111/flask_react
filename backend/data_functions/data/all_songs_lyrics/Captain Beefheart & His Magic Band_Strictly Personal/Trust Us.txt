Trust Us Lyrics
The path is the mask of love, a way, a way
The flow is the task above today
There is no other way
There is no other way

You gotta trust us when you need a friend
To find us, you gotta look within
You gotta trust us
You gotta trust us
Before you turn to dust
Before you turn to dust
You gotta see before you see
You gotta be before you be

(We love you)
You gotta touch without taint
You gotta hear without fear, oh
You gotta feel to reveal
You gotta touch without taint
Such is is and uh ain't is ain't
Such is is and uh ain't is ain't

We're for you, love you, with you, love you, just a few
We love you, we tell you true, we love you
The path is youth, let the dying die
The path is life, yeah, let the lying lie
Let the dying die, let the lying lie
Let the lying lie, let the dying die
The dying die

The path is youth, let the dying die
The path is life, yeah, let the lying lie

Let the dying die, let the lying lie lie
Let the dying die, ooh uh, lying lie
Let the die die die, little uh, lying lie
Little uh, die die die, little uh, ooh lying lie
Let the ooh, lying lie, let the lying lie
Let the lie lie, little uh, die die die
Little uh, lie lie lie, little uh, let the dying die
Let the lying lie, ooh the lying lie
Oooh, let the
Oooooh, let the
Let the dying die and uh, let the lying lie
Oooooh, let the lying lie and the...
Lying lie, lying lie, let the dying die
Let the lying lie, let the dying die
And the lying lie, and the dying die
And the lying lie, and the lying lie
Let the lying lie, let the dying die
(trust, trust, trust, trust, trust, trust, trust)
Oh, there're dogs on the fence there
Singin' straight end of a razor
Tom's raisin' up trashcans, smackin’ his lips
Aah, saying, “the food sure is good,” I said
Around the corner up round the alley
Half-shelled shoes off, tapping golly golly
Shaking like jelly, like heaven heaven, I said
Well they rolled around the corner turning up, seven come eleven
My lucky number Lord, I feel like I’m in heaven, I said
Well, I…
Well, I blink my eyes and I see that movie
Lord it’s red blue and green...Embed
