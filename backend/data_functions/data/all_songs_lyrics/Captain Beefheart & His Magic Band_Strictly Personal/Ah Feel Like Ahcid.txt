Ah Feel Like Ahcid Lyrics
Got a letter up this morning, how do you reckon it read?
Red blue and green, whoo, all through my head
Licked the stamps, saw a movie, dropped a stamp
Whoo, I ain't got no blues no more, I said
Put me up thinkin' a postman's groovy
I ain't, whoo, I ain't got the blues no more, I said

Well, send me with a letter, lord
Drop me with a telegram, I said
My baby walked just like she did
Walking on hard-boiled eggs with a... there's a...
She can steal a little....
I ain't blue no more, I said

Lord, one that jumped up, lord
Another one quackin', yes!
She got those great big drums sticking out
Whoo, big chicken legs
Beat when she walks, flappin' down the street where I live
Well, she slippin' along easy like fried chicken
Grew sort of greasy easy, hmmmmm...
Oh I ain't blue no more, I ain't blue no more, I said
Well she walked along crazy like kinda crazy
Sorta lazy sleazy, cheesy, you know what I mean, I said...Embed
