Waiting for the Rapture Lyrics
I still don't know what I was waiting for
A big love to fall down from the sky
She took my hand and picked me up off the floor
She put an apple in my eye

I said I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Come feed me and then bring me down

She come up to me
I can't remember what she said
Because I was in a trance and I forgot it all
Banging on about all that
Revolution in her head
Sheâ€™d make a lover seem so magical

She said I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Well heaven must have sent you
To save me from the rapture, yeah
I said I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Come feed me and then bring me down1Embed
