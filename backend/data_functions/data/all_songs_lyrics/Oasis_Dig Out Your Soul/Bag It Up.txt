Bag It Up Lyrics
Gold and silver and sunshine is rising up
Pour yourself another cup of Lady Grey
Take my hand in the meantime when you've had enough
You'll find me on the end of the runway, babe

Tell the world that you love them in a melody
Send my old piano and a telegram
Got to get me a doctor with a remedy
I'm gonna take a walk with a Monkey Man

Someone tell me I'm dreaming
The freaks are rising up through the floor
Everything I believe in
Is telling me that I want more, more, more

Lay your love on the fire when you come on in
I got my heebee jeebees hidden in a bag
Tell me what you desire and we'll bag it up
High

Someone tell me I'm dreaming
The freaks are rising up through the floor
Everything I believe in
Is telling me that I want more, more, more
Lay your love on the fire when you come on in
I got my heebee jeebees hidden in a bag
Tell me what you desire and we'll bag it up
High

Shine a light on the choir if you come on in
I got my heebee jeebees hidden in a bag
Tell me what you desire and we'll bag it up
