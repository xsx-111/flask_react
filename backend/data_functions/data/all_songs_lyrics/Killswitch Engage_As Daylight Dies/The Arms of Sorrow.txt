The Arms of Sorrow Lyrics
Imprisoned inside this mind
Hiding behind the empty smiles
So simple (the anguish)
As it mocks me
Crawling back into the dark
Running, always running, into the distance
Stop me before I bleed, again

The echoes of my voice
Follow me down
The shadows I cast
Follow me down

Deeper, I'm falling
Into the arms of sorrow
Blindly descending
Into the arms of sorrow

There must be serenity

The echoes of my voice
Follow me down
The shadows I cast
Follow me down
Deeper, I'm falling
Into the arms of sorrow
Blindly descending
Into the arms of sorrow

The demons of my own design
This horror must not remain

Deeper, I'm falling
Into the arms of sorrow
Blindly descending
Into the arms of sorrow

There must be serenity
There must be deliverance

Deeper, I'm falling
Blindly descending
Deeper, I'm falling4Embed
