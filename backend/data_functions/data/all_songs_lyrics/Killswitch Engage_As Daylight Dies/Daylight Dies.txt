Daylight Dies Lyrics
Slowly we watch the degradation of the civilization
The rise and fall of all we are stands before us

This place is evil
Is there an answer?
This world is vile
We are the answer
Oh

How long until we die?
Die from the inside out
How much is enough for us to see the light?
How much blood must be spilled?

Contest the lies
We cannot be so blind
Hear their cries
Don't wait 'til daylight dies (Daylight dies)

When there is blood on our hands
How can we (how can we) ignore the truth?
Contest the lies
We cannot be so blind
Hear their cries
Don't wait 'til daylight dies

The cost of one life
The price of one soul
Is too much to bear

No more broken promises
Our shattered hearts will heal
No more broken promises
No more, no more

Contest the lies
We cannot be so blind
Hear their cries
Don't wait 'til daylight dies

How long until it dies?
How long? How long?
How long until it dies?
How long? How long?Embed
