This Fire Lyrics
Yeah!
Yeah!

All I've ever wanted was destiny to be fulfilled
It is in my hands, I must not fail, and I must not fail

Even through the darkest days
This fire burns, always
This fire burns, always

This is the proving ground
As the heat begins to rise
Turn away from yesterday
Tomorrow's in my eyes, oh

Nevermore to be held down
By the wings of history
Nevermore to be cast aside
This day is mine

Even through the darkest days
This fire burns, always
This fire burns, always
I will not be denied in this final hour
I will not be denied, this day is mine
This passion inside me is burning, is burning
This passion inside me is burning, is burning

Even through the darkest days
This fire burns, always (Always)
This fire burns (fire burns), always
Always (Always)8Embed
