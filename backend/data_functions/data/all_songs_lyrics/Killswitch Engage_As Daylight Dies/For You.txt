For You Lyrics
The finest parts of me
Are only shades of you
To put aside the ties that bind
Is the goal of man
Go

I give my word to stand the test of time
No more wasted days
The past must perish

The line is drawn
I pledge my devotion
There is no turning back
This heart is yours
I sacrifice for you
For you, for you
This is immortal

The finest parts of me
Are only shades of you
Yeah
With each passing day
This heart is endless
No more wasted time
We are immortal

The line is drawn
I pledge my devotion
There is no turning back
This heart is yours
I sacrifice for you
For you, for you
This is the everlasting
This is immortal

Your words are my inspiration
Your life, the image of perfection
For all you are, for all you've done
I strive to be in your reflection

The line is drawn
I pledge my devotion
There is no turning back
My heart is yours
I sacrifice for you
For you, for you
This is the everlasting
This is immortalEmbed
