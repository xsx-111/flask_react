This Is Absolution Lyrics
We will not die this way, in unification
They cannot break these chains of faith
Let them do their worst (Let them do their worst)
Never slaves to iniquity

We will not die this way (This is absolution)
Death claims us no more (No more)
Do not grieve, end the suffering
We will live, live eternal

Will you take the stand among the dead?
Bury your fear, and hold fast to life
Come on

We will not die this way (This is absolution)
Death claims us no more (No more)
Do not grieve, end the suffering
We will live, live eternal

Anchor yourself to the foundation of everything you love
Believe you have just begun to live, to live
Don't let the world deceive you
Don't let their words betray you
Don't let their lies deceive you
Let them do their worst

We will not die this way (This is absolution)
Death claims us no more (No more)
Do not grieve, end the suffering
We will live, live eternalEmbed
