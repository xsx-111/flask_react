Desperate Times Lyrics
Time and time again I stand at the crossroad
Where the weight of my burden eclipses my resolve
This broken path I've chosen, I walk it alone
Though I feel forgotten, you've carved my name in stone

In these desperate times, this I plead
When all else fails, remember me

This is daily crucifixion and these rusty nails leave scars
My jagged crown is at my side
Anguish is never far

In these desperate times, this I plead
When all else fails, remember me

This is a blood-oath
They are nothing to me anymore
But your voice means more to me than you'll ever know

There's no question
You're the answer
I will find you
In these desperate times, this I plead (This I plead)
When all else fails, remember me
In these desperate times, this I plead (This I plead)
When all else fails, remember meEmbed
