Reject Yourself Lyrics
Their cries are blown away with the wind
How passive can we be before humanity is lost?
Turning our backs on those who need love
We must not rest while healing is needed

Tear down the veil
That bars your heart from feeling this
Dedicate yourself
Give your soul to compassion
With open arms, embrace this heart
With open eyes, behold the truth
Embrace this life

So little time is left
We must be relentless in our pursuit of those in torment

Tear down the veil (Tear down the veil)
That bars your heart from feeling this
Dedicate yourself (Dedicate yourself)
Become the voice of compassion
With open arms, embrace this heart
With open eyes, behold the truth
Embrace this life
Can you reject yourself?
Can you feel their agony?
In a world that feeds on disregard
Heal the broken hearted1Embed
