Break the Silence Lyrics
As I live and breathe
I'm watching, watching a world die
We greet this with apathy
No longer

Consumed by self
We walk through each day
With no mind for deprivation
And moral decay
We must destroy and rebuild
We must destroy and rebuild
For the sake of all
It starts with one
With one

As I live and breathe
I'm watching, watching a world die
We greet this with apathy
No longer

If we can't break the silence (How can we survive?)
Search inside yourself (And know that you're alive)
We must break the silence
Now we are alive
Silent, no longer
Make this world take notice
That change is in our hands
The battle has just begun
We are not defeated

If we can't break the silence (How can we survive?)
Search inside yourself (And know that you're alive)
We must break the silence
Now we are alive
Silent, no longer

With all that I am
I will lift my voice
To start this revolution
It starts today
And it starts with me
Silent, no longer
With all I am (I will lift my voice)
With all I am
It starts with me

Break the silence (Break the silence)
Break the silence
We are alive
Break the silence (Break the silence)
Break the silence
We are alive1Embed
