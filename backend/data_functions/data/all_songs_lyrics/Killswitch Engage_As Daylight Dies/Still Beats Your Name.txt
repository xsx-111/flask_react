Still Beats Your Name Lyrics
Who knows how long, I've been lost in the dark
Followed closely by the footsteps of my failures
What can I do, to alter my perception
Of the way and the truth?

Let this burden drift away

Who knows how long, the void has swallowed me
I only wish for nothing more than peace to find me
How can this be? We've come so far
To let the weight destroy our grand design

Let this burden drift away
My pledge remains faithful to you

And my heart still beats your name

Drowning once again
Will I live another day?
To reach the surface
Let this burden drift away
Drowning once again
Will I live another day?
To reach the surface
Let this burden drift away

Drowning, choking, fading, life!
Is this the moment where I leave the blackness?
Is this the moment of my rebirth?

Who knows how long, I've been lost in the dark
Followed closely by the footsteps of my failures
What can I do, to alter my perception
Of the way and the truth?

Drowning once again
Will I live another day?
To reach the surface
Let this burden drift away

Drowning again
Reach the surface
Let it drift awayEmbed
