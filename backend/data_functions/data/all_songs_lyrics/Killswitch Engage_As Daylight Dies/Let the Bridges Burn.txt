Let the Bridges Burn Lyrics
We have come too far to let our fulfillment fall away
I must refuse to renounce my integrity
We stand in defiance to their ethics
Let the grief they have inflicted serve as our call to arms
Are you ready?  (Are you ready? )
Are you willing to be the catalyst?
We can no longer be indifferent
Restore this dying world

From misery we have turned away
Ignite the past
Let the bridges burn

My eyes watch the unholy be left in the distance
The division of our souls from our blasphemous tongues
This is our atonement

From misery we have turned away
Ignite the past
Let the bridges burn
From sorrow (From sorrow)
We have turned away
To the past (To the past)
Let the bridges burn
I have bled for the truth
There is no surrender
Move forward
Commit yourself
Destroy all lies

From ashes to ashes
From dust to dust
From ashes to ashes
From dust to dust

From misery we have turned away
Ignite the past
Let the bridges burn

Let the bridges burn
Let the bridges burnEmbed
