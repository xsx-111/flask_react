Be One Lyrics
With conviction
You must stand your ground
Don't be deceived
Strength is salvation

It is so easy to live the life of a follower

We must kill the idols
Don't fall prey to seduction
With single-mindedness
We must pursue the truth

Nevermore the victim
Let them say that we are not of their world

With the promise of life
We are strong
We will carry on

Kill!
Kill the idols
No more disillusion
Let them say what they will what they will (What they will)
Their answer to our higher calling
Is conceived by their hatred

Nevermore the victim
Let them say that we are not of their world

With the promise of life
We are strong
We will carry on

With the promise of life
We are strong
We will carry on

Be one for your conviction
Be one for your devotion
You will be hated for your dedication
You will be hated
You will be hated
With the promise of life
We are strong
We will carry onEmbed
