The Gates LyricsTears me up to be stuck at the gates
How you stay in one place like molasses
All you want
All you want
Is somebody to get off on
Alibi with the man that you offer
All the ways it's untrue, I won't fight
All you're not
All you're not
All dishonest in your heart
Lullaby and they play it on the guitar
Fire you up to get out and get some
All this is
All this is
But the bottle did get dropped out
All you want
All you want
Is somebody to get off onEmbed
