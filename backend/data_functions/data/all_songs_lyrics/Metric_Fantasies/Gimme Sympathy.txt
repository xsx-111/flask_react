Gimme Sympathy Lyrics
Get hot
Get too close to the flame
Wild, open space
Talk like an open book
Sign me up
Got no time to take a picture
I'll remember someday
All the chances we took

We're so close
To something better left unknown
We're so close
To something better left unknown
I can feel it in my bones

Gimme sympathy
After all of this is gone
Who would you rather be
The Beatles or The Rolling Stones?
Oh, seriously
You're gonna make mistakes, you're young
Come on, baby, play me something
Like "Here Comes the Sun"
Come on, baby, play me something
Like "Here Comes the Sun"
Don't go
Stay with the all-unknown
Stay away from the hooks
All the chances we took

We're so close
To something better left unknown
We're so close
To something better left unknown
I can feel it in my bones

Gimme sympathy
After all of this is gone
Who would you rather be
The Beatles or The Rolling Stones?
Oh, seriously
You're gonna make mistakes, you're young
Come on, baby, play me something
Like "Here Comes the Sun"
Gimme sympathy
After all of this is gone
Who would you rather be
The Beatles or The Rolling Stones?
Oh, seriously
You're gonna make mistakes, you're young
Come on, baby, play me something
Like "Here Comes the Sun"
Come on, baby, play me something
Like "Here Comes the Sun"
Come on, baby, play me something
Like "Here Comes the Sun"4Embed
