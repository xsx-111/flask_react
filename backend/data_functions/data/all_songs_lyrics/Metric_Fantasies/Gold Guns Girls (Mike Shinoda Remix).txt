Gold Guns Girls (Mike Shinoda Remix) LyricsAll the gold
And the guns
In the world
Couldn't get you off
All the gold
And the guns
And the girls
Couldn't get you off
All the boys
All the choices
In the world
I remember when
We were gambling to win
Everybody else said
"Better luck next time."
I don't wanna bend
Like the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
All the lace
And the skin
In the shop
Couldn't get you off
All the toys
And the tools
In the box
Couldn't get you off
All the noise
All the voices never stop
I remember when
We were gambling to win
Everybody else said
"Better luck next time."
I don't wanna bend
Like the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend
Why you giving me a hard time?
I remember when
We were gambling to win
Everybody else said
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
More and more
More and more
More and more
More and more and
More and more
More and more
More and more
Is it ever gonna be enough?Embed
