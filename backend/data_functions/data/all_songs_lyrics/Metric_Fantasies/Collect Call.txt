Collect Call Lyrics
If the fire's out, baby
How you gonna keep me warm?
Supposing you let me
With the door wide open, no one can leave

I know it's a lie, I want it to be true
The rest of the ride is riding on you
Over goodbyes, we'll buy some place for...

Wishing you could keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move, I move with you
Wishing you could keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move, I move with you

If somebody's got soul
If somebody's got soul
If somebody's got soul
You've got to make them move
Make them move
I know it's a lie, I want it to be true
The rest of the ride is riding on you
Over goodbyes, we'll buy some place for...

Wishing you could keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move, I move with you
Wishing you could keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move, I move with you
Wishing you could keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move, I move with you
Wishing you could keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move, I move with you5Embed
