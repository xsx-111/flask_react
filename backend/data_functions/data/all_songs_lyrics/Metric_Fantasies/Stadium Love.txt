Stadium Love Lyrics
Wanna make a bet?
We'll be neck to neck
Taking off the gloves
Spider versus bat
Tiger versus rat
Rabbit versus dove

Wanna make a bet?
Odds are neck to neck
Taking off the gloves
Spider versus bat
Tiger versus rat
Owl versus dove

Every living thing pushed into the ring
Fight it out to wow the crowd
Guess you thought you could just watch
No one's getting out

Without stadium love
Without stadium love
Wanna make a trade?
Cougar for a snake
Wanna fall in love?
Wanna make a deal?
Angel versus eel
Owl versus dove

Every living thing pushed into the ring
Fight it out to wow the crowd
Guess you thought you could just watch
No one's getting out

Without stadium love
Without stadium love
We've got stadium love
We've got stadium love
We've got stadium love
We've got stadium love

Stadium love, love, love, love
Stadium love, love, love, loveEmbed
