Front Row Lyrics
I'm in the front row with a bottle
Don't know what I can't decide
I'm in the front row, I'm a model
Don't know what I can't describe

Burned out stars, they shine so bright
All of us
Burned out stars, they shine so bright

He's not perfect, he's my hero
Smashing the piano
Spitting on the front row
Chronic confrontation
Psychic conversation
Radical compassion
Louder than the action of all of us

Burned out stars, they shine so bright
All of us
Burned out stars, they shine so bright
All the stars
Burned out stars, they shine so bright
All of us
Burned out stars, they shine so bright
I'm in the front row with a bottle
Don't know what I can't decide
I'm the front row, I'm a model
Don't know what I can't describe

Burned out stars, they shine so bright
All of us
Burned out stars, they shine so bright

He's not perfect, he's a victim
Of his occupation
Social insulation
Secret intervention
Charging with possession
I just wanna watch him
Make or break and beat them

All the stars
Burned out stars, they shine so bright
All the stars
Burned out stars, they shine so bright
All the stars
Burned out stars, they shine so bright
All the stars
Burned out stars, they shine so bright
Burned out stars, they shine so bright
Burned out stars, they shine so bright
Burned out stars, they shine so bright
Burned out stars, they shine so bright1Embed
