Waves LyricsSaw the water, not the waves
Caught your eye, forgot your name
Always leaving, either way
I want you to stop me
Episodes to fantasize
TV movie of our lives
The future is all mine
I'll find it on my way back
When I'm gone
I'll know what I've done
I'll go where I don't belong
It's all, not one
I love everything
No sleep; I lose everything
Oh don't tell me again
I won't see you again
Not one
I love everything
No sleep; I lose everything
Oh, don't tell me again
I won't see you again
Saw the waves, but not the tide
I couldn't stay, I don't know why
A sailor married to the sea
My luck is a lost key
The door is locked from the inside
Don't wait around, I won't arrive
Keep a room somewhere for me
I'll find it on my way back
When I'm gone
I'll know what I've done
I'll go where I don't belong
It's all, not one
I love everything
No sleep; I lose everything
Oh don't tell me again
I won't see you again
Not one
I love everything
No sleep; I lose everything
Oh, don't tell me again
I won't see you againEmbed
