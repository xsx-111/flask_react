Twilight Galaxy Lyrics
Did they tell you, "You should grow up,"
When you wanted to dream?
Did they warn you, "Better shape up
If you want to succeed."
I don't know about you
Who are they talking to?
They're not talking to me

I'm higher than high
Lower than deep
I'm doing it wrong
Singing along
I'm higher than high
Lower than deep
I'm doing it wrong
Singing along

Did I ask you for attention
When affection is what I need?
Thinking sorrow is perfection
I would wallow 'til you told me
There's no glitter in the gutter
There's no twilight galaxy
Go higher than high, ooh
Go lower than deep, ooh
Keep doing it wrong, ooh
Keep singing along, ooh
Go higher than high, ooh
Go lower than deep, ooh
Keep doing it wrong, ooh
Keep singing along, ooh

I'm alright, come on, baby
I've seen all the demons that you've got
If you're not alright now, come on, baby
I'll pick you up and take, take you where you want
Anywhere you want
Anywhere you want
Anywhere you want
Anything you want

I'm higher than high
Lower than deep
I'm doing it wrong
Singing along
Go higher than high, ooh
Go lower than deep, ooh
Keep doing it wrong, ooh
Keep singing along, ooh
Go higher than high, ooh
Go lower than deep, ooh
Keep doing it wrong, ooh
Keep singing along, ooh
I'm higher than high1Embed
