Blindness Lyrics
Send us a blindfold, send us a blade
Tell the survivors, help is on the way
I was a blind fool, never complained
All the survivors singing in the rain
I was the one with the world at my feet
Got us a battle, leave it up to me

Find us a trap door, find us a plane
Tell the survivors, help is on the way
I was a blind fool, I never complained
All the survivors singing in the rain
I was the one with the world at my feet
Got us a battle, leave it up to me

What it is and where it stops, nobody knows
You gave me a life I never chose
I wanna leave but the world won't let me go
Wanna leave but the world won't let me go
What it is and where it stops, nobody knows
You gave me a life I never chose
I wanna leave but the world won't let me go
Wanna leave but the world won't let me go
What it is and where it stops, nobody knows
You gave me a life I never chose
I wanna leave but the world won't let me go
Wanna leave but the world won't let me go
What it is and where it stops, nobody knows
You gave me a life I never chose

I was the one with the world at my feet
Got us a battle, leave it up to me
Leave it up to me
Leave it up to meEmbed
