Satellite Mind Lyrics
Hold it, I'm about to drop off
Let me tell you my last thought
Drift into a deep fog
Lost where I forgot to hold it
I can feel you most when I'm alone

Coming home 'cause I want to
Hang out with a starlet
Stare up at the ceiling
Preview of a screening
Flashback of a feeling
Sick sense of a calling
Heard you fuck through the wall
I heard you fuck

When I'm bored
I send vibrations
In your direction
From the satellite mind
When I'm bored
I send vibrations
In your direction
From the satellite mind
I'm not suicidal, I just can't get out of bed
I drift into a deep fog
Lost where I forgot to hold it
I can feel you most when I'm alone
I can feel your ghost when I'm alone

Coming home 'cause I want to
Hang out with a starlet
Stare up at the ceiling
Hiding and revealing
Flashback of a feeling
Sick sense of a calling
Heard you fuck through the wall
I heard you fuck

When I'm bored
I send vibrations
In your direction
Through the satellite mind
When I'm bored
I send vibrations
In your direction
Through the satellite mind
When your voice
Became vibrations
Through the satellite mind
Through the satellite mind
It sounded like mine
Mine, mine
It sounded like, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
It sounded like mine
Mine, mine
It sounded like you, ooh
You, ooh
Ooh, ooh
It sounded like mine
It sounded like, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
It sounded like mine
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, oohEmbed
