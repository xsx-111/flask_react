Gold Guns Girls Lyrics
All the gold and the guns in the world
(Couldn't get you off)
All the gold and the guns and the girls
(Couldn't get you off)
All the boys, all the choices in the world

I remember when we were gambling to win
Everybody else said, "Better luck next time."
I don't wanna bend like the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?

All the lace and the skin in the shop
(Couldn't get you off)
All the toys and the tools in the box
(Couldn't get you off)
All the noise, all the voices never stop
I remember when we were gambling to win
Everybody else said, "Better luck next time."
I don't wanna bend, let the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend
Why you givin' me a hard time?
I remember when we were gambling to win
Everybody else said, "HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA"

Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?

More and more, more and more, more and more
More and more and more and more, more and more
More and more and more and more
More and more, more and more, more and more
More and more and more and more, more and more
More and more and more and more
Is it ever gonna be enough?
(More and more, more and more, more and more)
Is it ever gonna be enough?
(More and more, more and more, more and more)
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
(More and more, more and more, more and more)
Is it ever gonna be enough?
(More and more, more and more, more and more)
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
(More and more, more and more, more and more)
Is it ever gonna be enough?
(More and more, more and more, more and more)
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
(More and more, more and more, more and more)
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?8Embed
