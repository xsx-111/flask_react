Dead Cowboy LyricsTake George Bush to Afghanistan
He's gonna bathe in a river of blood
He wants to party till the wheels fall off
Six feet underground
What the world needs
Is another dead cowboy
Take George Bush to Afghanistan
Throw him in an oil pit, six feet deep, six feet wide
We're gonna cook him till his ears fall off
What the world needs
Is another dead cowboyEmbed
