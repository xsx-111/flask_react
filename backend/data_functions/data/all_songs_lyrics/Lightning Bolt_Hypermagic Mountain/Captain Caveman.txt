Captain Caveman LyricsI don't know what you've been told
That streets should be paved with gold
I can't know just what you read
But health is all the wealth I need
Birds and squirrels and bees and trees
All the things that ride the breeze
Money makes the world go round
Drags it down and burns it out
I am the caveman
I am the timebomb
Who's got the gameplan
This is the anthem
Fire fire
Burning higher
Making music
Like a choirEmbed
