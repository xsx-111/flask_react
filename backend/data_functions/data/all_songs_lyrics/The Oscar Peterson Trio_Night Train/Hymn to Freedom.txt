Hymn to Freedom Lyrics

When every heart joins every heart
And together yearns for liberty
That's when we'll be free
When every hand joins every hand
And together molds our destiny
That's when we'll be free
Any hour any day, the time soon will come
When men will live in dignity
That's when we'll be free, we will be
When every man joins in our song
And together singing harmony
That's when we'll be free1Embed
