Nothing from Something Lyrics
Things are coming down on me
They never seem to let it be
It seems like everything I say just starts another fight
The pressure's building up inside
I got to let it out tonight
Shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright

Going to break it
And never stop running
Making nothing from something

Cut me for the lion's share
It's mindless, but I don't care
Because no matter what I say
I'm in a another fight
Take more shit, I've had enough
Tonight I'm going to rip it up
Broken windows cure my ills and make me feel alright
