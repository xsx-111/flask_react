Hypodermic Lyrics
When you're feeling low
Hypodermic's where you go
When you're with yourself
You wish you could be someone else

Can't you see like you saw anymore?
Can't you feel like you felt before?
Can't you face anything anymore?
When life's a waste
Run away
Your life's a waste
Run away
Run away!

Once you get a ride
Doesn't matter where you lied
Once you shoot it in
Doesn't matter who you've been

Can't you see like you saw anymore?
Can't you feel like you felt before?
Can't you face anything anymore?
When life's a waste
Run away
Your life's a waste
Run away
Run away!
Oh, you're reaching in
But you don't know where to begin
All your dance and song
Won't matter when you're gone

Can't you see like you saw anymore?
Can't you feel like you felt before?
Can't you face anything anymore?
When life's a waste
Run away
Your life's a waste
Run away
Run away!
Run away, run away
Run awayEmbed
