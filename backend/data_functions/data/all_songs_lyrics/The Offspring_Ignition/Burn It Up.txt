Burn It Up Lyrics
I think I'm burning up inside
I think I'll take a little ride
I'm going to light up everything in sight
I'll drive on by your yard
And throw a Molotov cocktail at your car
Then another in the local bar

Ignition
They call it an obsession but I think it's kinda bitching
I think it's kinda neat
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I want to burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro

Tonight this hood will be a pyre
I'm going to set your house on fire
I'll dance around the pretty flames
Such a wonderful game!

Ignition
They call it an obsession but I think it's kinda bitching
I think it's kinda neat
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I want to burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I want to make a tiki torch
I'm going to throw it on your porch
Then I'm going to run away
And come back another day
So many houses, so little time
So many reasons, I'm not a crime
I'd like to set you up1Embed
