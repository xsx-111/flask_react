Dirty Magic Lyrics
In my own simple way
I think she wants me only
She said come over right away
But she's just not that way
Her little soul is stolen
See her put on a brand-new face

Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic
The things you say
The games you play
Dirty magic

I should know better than
To think I'd reach inside her
It's all a cloudy kind of daze
She's not so sweet today
She mocks me, I'm no fighter
It all just seems like such a waste
Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic
The things you say
The games you play
Dirty magic

It's oversimplified
It's oversimplified
It's oversimplified

Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic
The things you say
The games you play
