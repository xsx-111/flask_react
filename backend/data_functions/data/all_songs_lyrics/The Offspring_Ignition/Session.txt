Session LyricsAh fuck!
Fuck fuck fuck!!!
Oh...

I don't know when it got this way
I don't know how long she's going to stay
Every week, it's the same, in her room
And that's why I came

Oh, here I go, I go again
Our rendezvous never seem to end
I know where I'll be, I'll make this confession
Back in her bed for another goddamn

Session
I'll never learn
Session
God knows I try
Session
Keep coming back for session
And I don't know why
Session
I'll never learn
Session
I'll never see
Session
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold on
Got a, got a hold on me
Some might say it's a fling
For all I know, it don't mean a thing
Either way, I can't complain
Ain't no strings
Guess I got it made

Oh, here I go, I go again
Our little things never seem to end
I know where I'll be, I'll make this confession
Back in her bed for another goddamn
