I See You Standing There LyricsI see you in the park
I see you doing well
Playing with your children
Everything is swell
(Standing there) x4
I see you in the car
Trudding into school
Everything is great
Everything is cool
(Standing there)x4
I'm hiding
In the shadows
And I see you standing there
I'm hiding
In the darkness
And I see you standing there
When i see you standing there
And I see you standing there
I see you in the park
I see you doing well
Playing with your children
Everything is swell
(Standing there)x4
I see you in the car
Trudding into school
Everything is great
Everything is cool
(Standing there)x4
I'm hiding
In the shadows
And I see you standing there
I'm hiding
In the darkness
And I see you standing there
When i see you standing there
And I see you standing there
Standing there
Standing there
I'm standing there
Standing there
Go!
Don't look!Embed
