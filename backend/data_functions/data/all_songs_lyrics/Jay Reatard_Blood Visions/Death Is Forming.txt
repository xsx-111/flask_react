Death Is Forming LyricsAlone in a room
Needless I sit
I close my eyes
And try to forget
Death is calling
Get in line
Death is forming
Forming death
Death is calling
Death is forming
Forming death
Death is calling
Get in line
Alone in a room
Needless I sit
I close my eyes
And try to forget
Death is calling
Get in line
Death is forming
Forming death
Death is forming
Death is forming
Forming death
Death is calling
Get in lineEmbed
