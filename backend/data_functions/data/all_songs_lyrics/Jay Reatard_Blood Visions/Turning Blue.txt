Turning Blue Lyrics
You got me sweating
Shaking in my skin
I know It's nice
To find beginnings and ends

As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams
As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams

Look at you
You've got nothing to do
Don't run around
Trying to win this town

As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams
As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams

As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams
As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams
As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams
As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams
As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams
As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams
As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreams
As sad as it seems
You're turning blue in my dreamsEmbed
