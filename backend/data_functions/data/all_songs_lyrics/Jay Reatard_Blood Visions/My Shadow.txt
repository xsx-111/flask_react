My Shadow LyricsIf this is the way it's going to be
Then I am so sure
That life has lost
It's only thrill and is a total bore
I can't see your face
Cause I'm a looking at
I can't see your face
Cause I'm a looking at you
The way you walk
The way you step on through
The way you do
All the things you do
The way you walk
The way you step on through
I can't tell truth
(My shadow)x5
My shadow's stuck
(My shadow)x5
My shadow's stuck
A thought in time is
All you ever seem to be
A nightmare and dream
Or maybe a memory
I can't see your face
Cause I'm a looking at
I can't see your face
Cause I'm a looking at you
The way you walk
The way you step on through
The way you do
All the things you do
The way you walk
The way you step on through
I can't tell truth
(My shadow)x5
My shadow's stuck
(My shadow)x5
My shadow's stuck
I don't feel too well
I don't feel too well
And I don't really care
Cause I don't feel too well
Cause I'm a looking at you3Embed
