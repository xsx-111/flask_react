My Family LyricsWho could've known
Things could have
Gone so wrong
One moment everything is here
The next it is all gone
A child's love
Turns into a bloody mom
Who could've known
Things could have
Gone so wrong
Walking through the halls
The photographs
Line the walls
Memories they hurt
The bludgeoning will send them all
Please close your eyes
As the blood
Makes impact
And say goodbye
Cause they are never coming back
My family
They never knew
My family
They never knew
My family
The never knew
My familyEmbed
