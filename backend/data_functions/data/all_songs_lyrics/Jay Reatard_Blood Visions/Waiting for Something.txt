Waiting for Something LyricsIt's not complete
I must compete
Stand on my feet
Live with these creeps
I'm sitting
And waiting for something to happen
Oh no no no!
They won't get me
It's not complete
I must compete
Stand on my feet
Live with these creeps
I'm sitting
And waiting for something to happen
Oh no no no!
They won't get me1Embed
