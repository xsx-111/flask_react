Fading All Away LyricsTime may heal wounds
But I will kill you
Slowly
Fading all away
Look out your window
To watch the wind blows
Slowly
Fading all away
I won't stop
Until you're dead
Because of voices in my head
I won't stop
Until you're dead
Helping you
And hurting me
Time will heal the wounds but I
Will kill you
Slowly
Fading all away
Hear
The voices cry and watch
The feelings die
Slowly
Fading all away
I won't stop
Until you're dead
Because of voices in my head
I won't stop
Until you're dead
Helping you
And hurting me
Time will heal the wounds
But I will kill you
Slowly
Fading all awayEmbed
