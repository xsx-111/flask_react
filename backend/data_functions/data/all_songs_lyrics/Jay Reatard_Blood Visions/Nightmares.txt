Nightmares LyricsWoke from my sleep last night
All sweaty with quite a fright
Looked to see if you're next to me
Somehow I knew you wouldn't be
Seems that my dreams only come true
When my dreams aren't about you
Nightmares are all you bring to me
I'll keep searching for you
Lonely days and sleepless nights
This doesn't seem so right
It leaves me wanting more
More than I did before
Seems that my dreams only come true
When my dreams aren't about you
Nightmares are all you bring to me
I'll keep searching for youEmbed
