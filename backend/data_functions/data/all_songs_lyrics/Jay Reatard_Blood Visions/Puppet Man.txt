Puppet Man LyricsFind this puppet man
In a garbage can
Take a piss from a jar
Picking bugs from his arms
He don't question things
He ain't got no dreams
Find this puppet man
In a garbage can
I heard you never can die
You don't have to lie
Lying in my garbage can
I don't want to be his friend

Picking bugs from his arms
He don't question things
He ain't got no dreams
Find this puppet man
In a garbage can
I heard you never can die
You don't have to lie
Lying in my garbage can
I don't want to be his friendEmbed
