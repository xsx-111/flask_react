Easily Led LyricsI am not easily led
Despite the head
I was just trying to cross the street with you
I was just a step devoted
But I am not easily led
I'm suggestible at times, it's true
But only by you
I lay open jelly-limbed
To your smallest whim
But I am not easily fed
I'll turn my head
When you come at me with a spoon
No, I am not easily led
Despite the head
I was just trying to get along with you
I was just trying to be a humanEmbed
