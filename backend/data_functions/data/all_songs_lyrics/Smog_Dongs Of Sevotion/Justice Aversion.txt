Justice Aversion LyricsHappens on a side street, maybe
Happens on a main street, maybe
Lion bites zebra neck
Zebra stomps lion head
It's just this
Justice aversion
For the improper way
Things are done today
I root for the underdog
No matter who they are
Like the bank robber in the getaway car
It's just this
Justice aversion
For the improper way
Things are done today
I could stay up all night talking
About animal nature
And a universe hesitant
To grant us grace
It could happen on a side street, maybe
It could happen on a main street, maybe
It's just this
Justice aversion
I root for the underdog
No matter who they are
Like the bank robber in the getaway carEmbed
