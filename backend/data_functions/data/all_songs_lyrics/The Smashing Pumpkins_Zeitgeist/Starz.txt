Starz LyricsBorn of love and cast in light
Don’t you know we cannot die
We are stars
We are
We are stars
We are
We are stars
We are
The stars above, stars of grace
Shining down what’s left of face
You hurt so bad
This knowing, this fallacy
I want so much
To follow as I lead
For love I keep
Silent I weep
Dead suns rule dead air
But Heaven is everywhere
Stars…
Torn from god and flung towards night
Don’t you want what I can’t fight
We are stars
We are
We are stars
We are
We are stars
We are
The stars that shine, stars that bleed
Silver seeking destiny
So follow please
This hurts so much
This knowing carries me
We want so bad
We forget we are free
Spirit smile on
Deep black diamond
So rise the lost toys
Island of white noise
And purple haze
We are starz
We are starz
We are starz
What hurts so much
Is knowing we are free!Embed
