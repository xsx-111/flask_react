Neverlost LyricsAll hands on deck
Setting sail to get wrecked off course
You make what you want of me
I will keep you anyway
Let’s fill these hours and kill desire
Let’s fill these hours and kill desire
I’m in touch with you
Let’s kill these hours and fill desire
Every turn is torture thought
Every kicking of the drum
I’ve seen the film
I know the place
I’m never lost
There’s just one way across
I’m never lost
Headlights shoot north
The ends of earth off course
Of course
If you think just right
If you’ll love you’ll find
Certain truths left behind
All this is that once forgot
A closing down of the gate
But oh these hours
I lost my place
I’m never lost
There’s just one way
There’s no disgrace in failing me
Let’s kill these hours and fill desire
I’m in touch with you
Let’s kill these hours and fill desire
I’m in touch with you
I’m in touch with youEmbed
