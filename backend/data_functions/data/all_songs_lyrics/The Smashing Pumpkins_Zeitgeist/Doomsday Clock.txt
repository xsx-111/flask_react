Doomsday Clock LyricsIs everyone afraid?
Is everyone ashamed?
They’re running towards their holes, to find out
Apocalyptic means are lost among our dead
A message to our friends to get out
There’s wages on this fear
Oh so clear
Depends on what you’ll pay to hear
They’re bound to kill us all
In whitewashed halls
Their jackals lick their paws
Please don’t stop
It’s lonely at the top
These lonely days
When will they ever stop?
This doomsday clock ticking in my heart
Not broken
I love life every day
In each and every way
Kafka would be proud, to find out
I’m certain of the end
It’s the means that has me spooked
It takes an unknown truth to get out
I’m guessing i’m born free, silly me
I was meant to beg from my knees
Please don’t stop
It’s lonely at the top
These lonely days
When will they ever stop?
This doomsday clock ticking in my heart
These lonely days when will they ever stop?
We gotta dig in, gas masks on
Wait in the sunshine, all bug-eyed
If this is living?
Sakes alive!
Well then they can’t win
No one survives
Is everyone afraid?
You should be ashamed
Apocalyptic screams
Mean nothing to the dead
Kissing that ‘ol sun
To know all there is
Come on, last call
You should want it all
Ah, it’s lonely at the top
These lonely days
When will they ever stop
This doomsday clock ticking in my heart
These lonely days
When will they ever stop
This ticking in my heart
Is everyone afraid?Embed
