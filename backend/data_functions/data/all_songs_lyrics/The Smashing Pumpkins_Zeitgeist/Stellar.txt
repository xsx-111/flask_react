Stellar LyricsIs it wrong to say
I'm lost in your embrace
Is it wrong to say so?
Within a dream I had, some vista vast
Meant for the poor of soul
Struck from the firstborn
Leapt from a ray of hope
Into a body I once knew
Built a mere kingdom of self abuse
Hitched to some rainbow
Once more, it's always yours
Once more
The wait hurts worse than the blows
Words buy
New life
Dust clears
No scars
Burnt but
Bright eyed
The sun's out
A still night stirs
The wait hurts worse than the blows
Is it wrong to say
There's God and then there's faith
Is it wrong to say so?
Withstood a thought so sad, I had to laugh
Cut from some polished bone
Crawled out of broken homes
Slipped on the afterglow
Into a worry and a cause
Stole from the bible chapter and verse
Stitched to an old sail
Once more, it's always yours
Once more
The wait hurts worse than the blowsEmbed
