United States LyricsTired eyes close for days
There’s no regret
’cause there’s no place
I don’t know what i believe
But if i feel safe
What do i need?
Revolution!
Revolution!
Revolution blues
What will they do?
Revolution!
Revolution!
What will they do to me?
Dulcet tongues whisper fast
The future yearns
Right now’s the past
Rouse me soon, the end draws nigh
Who’s side are you on?
Your blood you cannot buy
Revolution!
Revolution!
Revolution blues
What will they do?
Revolution!
Revolution!
What will they do to you?
We’re alive
I feel alright
So tonight
I got to ask you why?
Why tonight?
It’s no surprise
I’ve got to survive!
Freedom shines a light ahead
I’ll lead the last charge from bed
They said my last rites
I don’t have to run scared no more
Fight!
I wanna fight!
I wanna fight!
Revolution tonight!
I wanna fight!
I wanna fight! revolution tonight!
Acolyte, acolyte
Do you wanna watch me die?
Let me be something good
Let me prove something real like I should
Let me embrace every single living thing
Let me be every single moment I ever misunderstood3Embed
