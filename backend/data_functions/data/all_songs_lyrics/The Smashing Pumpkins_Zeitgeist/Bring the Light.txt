Bring the Light LyricsShot down i stood
Withstood my neighborhood
I got it wrong
But i could
Follow love lest i learn
It’s light
To bring the light
I fought with all my might, with light
Oh bring the light
Light, bring the light i never felt so good and right but tonight you’ll never
Need another sound
Oh, bring the light
Bring the light to me
Here and gone oh i trust
You’d spit upon my dust
And mix my ash with your blood
A son of God you know you must arrive
In the light
Bring the light, let’s bring the light
Light, oh bring the light
Light, bring the light
It’s yours not mine
If you just want to survive
Go grab a glimpse of any star in heaven’s high
I never felt so real and loved and alive
No shadows follow me unsung
In the light, bring the light to me
A flower song, clear and bright
Is it wrong, in neon white?
To insist you are mine
Standing dumb in the light
Bring the light
Oh, bring the light
Bring the light!
Light, bring the light
I never felt so real and right and alive
Don’t let them steal from you what’s yours by right
Light, bring the light
You know there comes a place and time
You can’t deny
With every movement shadows cast and align
Bring the light, bring the light
Bring the light let’s bring the light
Light, bring the lightEmbed
