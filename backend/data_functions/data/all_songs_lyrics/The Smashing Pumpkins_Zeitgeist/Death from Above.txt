Death from Above LyricsA little hunger
A little wonder of death from above
Oh death from above
Oh Mary, Mary
What are we asking of death from above?
Yes lord, I'm sinking
I wonder just how far
What was I thinking
Oh when I fell apart
I see the new moon
Cover me under the spell
I see the few souls
Who’d cover me hungry and cold
I know the first thing
When running up under your path
I know this can't last
Death from above
Shoo, here comes death from above
A little reject
A simple conjurer
Death from above
You rock-and-rollers
You certain victims of death from above
Ol’ death from above
Yes love I’m sinking
I hunger where you are
What’s left, but notice
To notice just how far
I see the moonlight
Cover me under her spell
I see the few souls
Begging me bury this ground
I know the valleys
When running up under the path
I know this rallies death from above
Ooh, here comes death from above
Ooh lord, I'm sinking
I just dont know how far
Comes death from above
Yes lord, I'm sinking
I hunger where you are
Death from above
Death from above
Yes lord, I'm thinking of death from above
Yes lord, I'm thinking of death from aboveEmbed
