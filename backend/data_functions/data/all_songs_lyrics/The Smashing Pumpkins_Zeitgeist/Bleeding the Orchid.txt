Bleeding the Orchid LyricsIf life is my witness
Love is my song
If nothing means no one
Then blank, i belong
If fear conquers easy
I can lead on
Milk from the flower
Blood from the dawn
So here we are
Upon your stage
The laughs we shared
The dreams we saved
Bleeding the orchid
We’re bleeding the orchid
Bleeding the orchid
Blessed my weakness
Blessed my wrongs
As hate forms the sequence
Of one by one
As freedoms die easy
We suffrage the want
There’s clouds in my shower
Ghosts in my arms
Youth is where you are
Faith some sinner’s child
We’re bleeding the orchid
We’re bleeding the orchid
Bleeding the orchid
Gilded art this silent march past triumph thru alarm
So thus charmed
Does this will stand for much?
But heart’s untouched by heart’s unloved
Bleeding the orchid
Here we are
Upon your stage
The love we share
The dreams we’ll save
They’re bleeding the orchid
They’re bleeding the orchid
They’re bleeding the orchid
They’re bleeding the orchidEmbed
