For God and Country LyricsI want to live for God and country
I want to give for God and country
It’s too late for some
It’s too late for what you’ve done
I can’t help what i divide in you
For God and country i’ll fight
For God and country i’ll die
For God and country my soul is so alive
My soul is so alive
Lay down your arms to me
Lay down your arms for God and country
I want to live where no one’s watching my way home
I want to give until i’m bursting with unknown
It’s too late for some
It’s too late for everyone
I can’t help what i destroy in you
Well who needs this anymore?
C’mon make it so
That’s when they build their cross of death
You won’t build your own
It’s time to wake up!
It’s time to wake up for good
I can’t help you though i should
For God and country we’ll fight
For God and country we’ll die
For God and country my soul is so alive
My soul is so alive
Lay down your arms to me
Lay down your arms for God and country
You can’t deny God and country
We’re fighting for our lives
You can’t deny God and country
Our souls are so aligned
In this time of God and country
We’ll take you on our side
It’s alright
My soul is so alive
With God and night
With God and country
My soul is so aliveEmbed
