Ogre Battle Lyrics
Ahh! Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh!

Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies
To find a new destination
That is the sign

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies
The palm of a hand the incredible size
One great big eye
Has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh, keep a lookout!"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south

(Ahhhh!)

Ogre-men are going home
And the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more
Oh-ho-ho
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle18Embed
