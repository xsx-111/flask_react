White Queen (As It Began) Lyrics
So sad, her eyes
Smiling, dark eyes
So sad, her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow, the lightest kiss
I walked alone

And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known

The white queen walks
And the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing, unheard
Pleading, one word
So sad, my eyes
She cannot see
How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name

And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came

White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait


My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's forevermore that I wait
Dear friend, goodbye
No tears in my eyes

So sad it ends
As it began10Embed
