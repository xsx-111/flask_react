Nevermore Lyrics
There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry
And the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore (Ahh)
Can't you see?
Listen to the breeze
Whisper to me, please
Don't send me to the path
Of nevermore

Even the valleys below
Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow (Ahh)
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me?
(Nevermore, nevermore)
Why did you deceive me?
(Nevermore, nevermore)
Send me to the path
Of nevermore (Ahh)
When you say you didn't love me
Anymore (Aahh)
(Ahh)
Nevermore
