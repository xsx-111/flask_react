Funny How Love Is Lyrics
Funny how love is everywhere
Just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere
You're bound to be
Funny how love is every song
In every key
Funny how love is coming home
In time for tea

Funny, funny, funny

Funny how love is the end of lies
When the truth begins
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love
In the shape of things
That's what love is
That's what love is

Funny how love  can break
Your heart so suddenly
Funny how love came tumbling down
With Adam and Eve
Funny how love is running
Wild and feeling free
Funny how love is coming home
In time for tea
Funny, funny, funny

From the earth below
To the heavens above
That's how far and funny is love
At any time, anywhere
If you gotta make love
Do it everywhere
That's what love is
That's what love is

Funny how love is everywhere
Just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere
You're bound to be
Funny how love is every song
In every key
Funny how love is when you
Gotta hurry home 'cause you're late for tea

Funny, funny, funny how love is
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love
In the shape of things
At any time, anywhere
If you got to make love do it everywhere
That's what love is
That's what love is3Embed
