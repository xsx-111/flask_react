The March of the Black Queen Lyrics
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Why don't you mean it
Why do I follow you
And where do you go


You've never seen nothing
Like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven
And then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
(And the world will so allow it)
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing
In a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys
Praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen
Poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that
Bring them down to size
(March to the Black Queen)


Put them in the cellar
With the naughty boys
A little bit of sugar
Then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on every
Finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun
Make this, make that
Keep making all that noise

(Oooh, march to the Black Queen)

Ooh, now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby
You can be my honey-Chile, yes

A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings
You are an angel
Remember to deliver
With the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul
Lies a man and very soon
He'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life
He'll bring a little love

I reign with my left hand
I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness
I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power, now do
The march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me
I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Ah ah ah ah

Walking true to style
She's vulgar, 'buse, and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes
And she never dots her "I's"
(She's our leader)


Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone
La la la la forever, forever
Ah ah ah ah ah
