Nothing Matters But You Lyrics
Since we met, I sit around and want you
I don't do the things I ought to do
I'm so in love, I let the world go by me
Nothing matters but you
Nothing matters but you

Every dream I dream, I dream about you
Loving you is all I wanna do
I'm so wrapped up that nothing can untie me
Nothing matters but you

Most folks need a world to conquer
Something big to do
They don't know the worlds I conquer
When I'm kissing you

Let them all go chasing after rainbows
I have found my pot of gold in you
Your love is all I need to satisfy me
Nothing matters but you
Nothing matters but youEmbed
