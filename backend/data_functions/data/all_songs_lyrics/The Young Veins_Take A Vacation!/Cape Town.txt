Cape Town Lyrics
Took you in the vineyard a couple hours after
I met you
Didn't need my passport, said I'd let you keep it
Forever

I hardly knew a thing about you
I got lost in Cape Town, in Cape Town
I saw you, I met you
I loved you, I left you in Cape Town

Woke me in the morning
Asked me if I meant it, I didn't
Asked to be her husband
She already had one in prison

I hardly knew a thing about you
I got lost in Cape Town, in Cape Town
I saw you, I met you
I loved you, I left you in Cape Town, in Cape Town

Ran all out of paper, lost it all in pontoon
When I was in Asia, I forgot how to call you
Went out to a graveyard to bum a couple of flowers
To give to you, when I got back to Cape Town
(I saw you, I met you) To Cape Town (I loved you, I left you) to Cape Town
(I saw you, I met you, I loved you, I left you) To Cape Town
(I saw you, I met you) To Cape Town (I loved you, I left you) to Cape Town
(I saw you, I met you) To Cape Town (I loved you, I left-)1Embed
