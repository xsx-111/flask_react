Heart of Mine Lyrics
If I could ask for anything, I'd only want my girl
I've seen a lot of things, going on all around the world
I had to leave her all alone
I wrote this down, so I could let her know that I only want to see her

You should take this heart of mine
She's always had that heart of mine
(Always had that heart of mine
Always had that heart of mine)

If I could win the lottery, we'd sail across the world
Travel to the Philippines
Buy an island, just for you and me
Girls on the equator never even compare, I only want to see her

You should take this heart of mine, she always had that heart of mine
You should take this heart of mine, she always had that heart of mine
(Always had that heart of mine
Always had that heart of mine)

You should take this heart of mine, she always had that heart of mine
You should take this heart of mine, she always had that heart of mine
You should take this heart of mine, she always had that heart of mine
You should take this heart of mine, she always had that heart of mine
(Always had that heart of mine, always had that heart of mine
Always had that heart of mine, always had that heart of mine...)
(Happy birthday, Ryan!)1Embed
