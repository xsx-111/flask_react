Take a Vacation! Lyrics
I need to take a vacation, if this is settling down
Then why aren't you here?
I want a big celebration, the night we get back in town
And I hope you're all there

We'll leave the waves at the ocean
And keep them all in a picture
We'll leave the cold where we came from
Our loneliness will keep us warm

We're going
Going
Going
Very far

I need to take a vacation, if this is settling down (If this is settling)
Then why aren't you here?
I want a big celebration, the night we get back in town
And I hope you're all there

We'll leave the past out to pasture
And take the days as they come
We'll leave the sand in a suitcase
So we don't forget the fun (Fun, fun, fun)
We're going, going
Going very far
We're going, going
Going very far

I need to take a vacation, (Vacation) if this is settling down
(If this is settling down) Then why aren't you here?
I want a big celebration, the night we get back in town
And I hope you're all there
And I hope you're all there
And I hope you're all there1Embed
