Young Veins (Die Tonight) Lyrics
Is 'young' a word for dumb?
A word for fun?
We have the time of our lives, every night
Like it's our job to lose our minds, every night

But if I were to die tonight
Would you cry
Or deny my place in your life?
I'm aware that you're scared of my heart, but it's there

Is 'young' a word for dumb?
A word for fun?
We have the time of our lives, every night
Like it's our job to lose our minds

Every night, it's the same, go to sleep with our blame
And the shame is enough to separate us
But we can't help ourselves
We're in love, and it really hurts when it's wrong

Is 'young' a word for dumb?
A word for fun?
We have the time of our lives, every night
Like it's our job to lose our minds
And it's every night
We have the time
Like it's our job
To lose our minds, every nightEmbed
