Everyone But You Lyrics
A part of you left the room
I am left talking to the apples

She comes to me when I dream
I'm tired of counting sheep to see her
I sleep because I need her
And everybody knows it but you

A wedding ring is just a thing
That weighs you down and occupies your finger
I know it sounds a little down
But love is all I'm really after

She comes to me when I dream
I'm tired of counting sheep to see her
I sleep because I need her
And everybody knows it but you, but you
Everybody knows it but you

I hope you're all listening
I'm pouring out my heart for paper
A part of me still believes
That love is all I'm really after
She comes to me when I dream
I'm tired of counting sheep to see her
I sleep because I need her
And everybody knows it but you, but you, everybody knows it but you

Everyone but you knows
Everyone but you
Everyone but you knows
Everyone but you2Embed
