Security LyricsI want security, yeah
Without it I'm at a great loss, I am now
Security, yeah
And I want it at any cost, I do
I don't want no money
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't want no pay
And it's a pity I can't have these
These things, baby, alright
Security, yeah
That's all I want from you
That's right
Security, yeah
A little love that will be true, right now
Your sweet lips you know they tell me
You're the one
Darling, how can I forget you now
Well how can I forget, alright
I want security, yeah
Well I'll tell you once again
Yes I will now
Security, yeah
And I want it to begin
That's right
I don't want no money
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't want no pay
And it's a pity I can't have these
These things, baby, alright
Just give me your heart, yeah
Oh, I want your love now
Just say you'll be mine, yeah
Oh, come on now baby
Say you'll be mine nowEmbed
