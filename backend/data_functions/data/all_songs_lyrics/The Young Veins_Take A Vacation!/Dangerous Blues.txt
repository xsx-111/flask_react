Dangerous Blues LyricsAll I do is lie
By the ocean side
Why do the clouds all turn gray just for you?
I've never bloomed such a beautiful blues
Step outside your door
And go down to the shore
Why do your eyes feel like shells in the dune?
What makes a crowd turn away from a tune?
I've never bloomed
Such a beautiful blues
Even the tide gets high at night
Even the truth is wrong sometimes
All I want to do
Is dig a hole with you
Feet are no strangers to the undertow
Wind won't decide which way to blow
But we will never leave
You're all that's left for me
This is a home we just don't have a door
Euphoria is a risk on the floor
Words keep on crawling from under the rug
Who knew that love was a dangerous drug?
Even the tide gets high at night
Even the truth is wrong sometimes, sometimes
Who knew that love was a beautiful blues?
Who knew that love was a dangerous drug?
Now I know love is a beautiful drug, I know that drug is a dangerous love
I know now love is a dangerous bluesEmbed
