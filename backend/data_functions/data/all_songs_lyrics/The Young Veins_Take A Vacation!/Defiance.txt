Defiance LyricsThere was a hope when we found the bridge
Of a place we'd never been... Defiance
And ever since I was a kid, they said, "just stay away from there
Boy, don't you ever live in defiance,"
Defiance
From the outside looking in
I sure do make an easy target
It's nice to think that you were always
Wanted
And I'm not afraid to laugh
And I don't mind taking a photograph
'Cause you don't ask for my autograph
In defiance, defiance
Yeah, she said that it was rust and lead
That love could never live again
But they found a way, to make it stay
In defiance, she asked, defiance, she asked:
"Can't we just be friends?"
This kind of thing always happens
I fell in love again
With defiance
Defiance of defiance
With defiance
Defiance
