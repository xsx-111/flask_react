Is It True? LyricsListen to the talk that's going around town
Everywhere you go they're spreading it around
Saying that you gone and found another one
Is it true my love oh, oh
What about the ring you gave me yesterday
Is it hard for me to throw it all away
As you said goodbye if you have no lie
Is it true my love oh, oh
Don't you know, don't you know
You're making me blue
Baby, baby say it isn't, say it isn't true
Coming down the street the story looks the same
Everyone I meet is whispering your name
Saying that you've gone and found another one
Is it true my love oh, oh
Saying that you've gone and found another one
Is it true my love oh, oh
Don't you know, don't you know
You're making me blue
Baby, baby say it isn't, say it isn't true
Coming down the street the story looks the same
Everyone I meet is whispering your name
Saying that you've gone and found another one
Is it true my love oh, ohEmbed
