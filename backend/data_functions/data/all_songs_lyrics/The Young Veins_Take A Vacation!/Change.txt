Change Lyrics
She was acting pretty, thought she owned the city
Someone should've told her that pretty ain't a job
And now she begs for money, no one calls her 'honey'
As she bothers shoppers in the parking lot

And gets her karma with a catch
Forget superstition by wearing it backwards
Lives under ladders and sleeps with black cats

Some people never change
They just stay the same way

I swear this like a sailor, love is not a favor
I find it's just a concept that we live inside
And if you can agree with me and Mr. Twain
In matters of opinion, our rivals are insane

Forget superstition by wearing it backwards
Lives under ladders and sleeps with black cats

Some people never change
They just stay the same way
Some people never change
They just stay the same way
Some people never change
They just stay the same way

Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change1Embed
