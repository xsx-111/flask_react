The Other Girl Lyrics
Don't wait around for love, you're not what he's thinking of
When he's with the other girl
Don't bother waiting up 'cause he, he's not where he's supposed to be
When he's with the other girl
When he's with the other girl

You, you were right, I was wrong
Like I always am, and you always are
You were right, I was wrong
Like I always am, and you always are

Don't have much to say right now, 'cause I'm trying to figure out
Why he's with the other girl
Life is not a fairy tale, they will send him straight to jail
Where he'll die and go to Hell, with the other girl
With the other girl

You, you were right, I was wrong
Like I always am, and you always are
You were right, I was wrong
Like I always am, and you always are
You, you were right, I was wrong
Like I always am, and you always are
You were right, I was wrong
Like I always am, and you always are2Embed
