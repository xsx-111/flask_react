Espionage Lyrics
Camouflage
All of your lies giddy-gad about
Appearances
Slickin' your tongue in and out of doubt
Everything is so complete
The world is at your feet

Espionage
Nothing new

Subterfuge
Gettin' real gone real quick's a bore
Without shoes
One or two nights on a different floor
Mother is a little vexed
At your homey neglect

Espionage
Aryan sex

You're gonna be well known
For just a little while
You're gonna be outgrown
To go a little while
To go a little while
Stipulate
24 hours in every year
Yeah, it's great
Out in the yard barks a trumpeteer
Say you had a way with words
That got away with you

Espionage
Says you're throughEmbed
