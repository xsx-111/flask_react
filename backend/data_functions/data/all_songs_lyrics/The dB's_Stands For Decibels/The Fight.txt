The Fight Lyrics
Well, I woke up in bed, it was the middle of the night
And we were still involved in a great big fight
She said, "I'll give you five minutes to get out of here"
I said, "I'll give you five minutes just to change your mind"
She said, "Don't hold your breath, it won't happen this time"

Did you see the way she looked at me?
Did you see the way she looked right through me?

It was a fight
We were involved in a fight
It was a fight
We were involved in a fight
It was a fight, yeah!
We were involved in a fight
It was a fight
We were involved in a fight

Well, I went downstairs, it was the middle of the night
And we were still involved in a great big fight
She said, "You never give me loving, think of how I feel"
I said, "You never give me money, you're so bad to me"
She said, "You never give me nothing, don't you talk to me"
Well, I went outside, it was the middle of the night
And we were still involved in a great big fight
She said, "Don't take the car, don't go away from here"
I said, "You never give me nothing, think of how I cried"
She said, "You shouldn't have come along if you didn't wanna ride"

Did you see the way she looked at me?
Did you see the way she looked right through me?

It was a fight
We were involved in a fight
It was a fight
We were involved in a fight
It was a fight, yeah!
We were involved in a fight
It was a fight
We were involved in a fight


It was a fight
We were involved in a fightEmbed
