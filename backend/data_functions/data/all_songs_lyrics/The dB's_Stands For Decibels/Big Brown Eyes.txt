Big Brown Eyes Lyrics
Every time I look into your big brown eyes
I get paralyzed, paralyzed
Every time you take a step down
Every time I think about the thousand guys
Who want you, I realize
Every time you take a step down

You give me something to think about
I'll give you something to live without
And you give me something to take the day away


You give me something to think about
I'll give you something to live without
And you give me something to take the day away

I can hardly wait for tomorrow to come around
I won't be found
Every time you take a step down
Every time you take a step down
You give me something to think about
I'll give you something to live without
And you give me something to take the day awayEmbed
