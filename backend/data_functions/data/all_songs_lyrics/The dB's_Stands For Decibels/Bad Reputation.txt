Bad Reputation Lyrics
New girl in school
She looks cool
Cool enough to cool you down
Like a summer vacation
She sleeps around
So they say
So do they of course
But she's got a bad reputation
Reputation
Reputation

They say you've got a bad reputation
But I say it's their imagination
You're an angel
Oh oh, oh oh
They say you get off on frustration
But I know you've got an explanation
You're an angel
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

She's got it bad
Got it bad, all right
But I've got it worse for her
And her bad reputation
Reputation
Reputation
They say you've got a bad reputation
But I say it's their imagination
You're an angel
Oh oh, oh oh
They say you get off on frustration
But I know you've got an explanation
You're an angel
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

They say you've got a bad reputation
But I say it's their imagination
You're an angel
Oh oh, oh oh
They say you get off on frustration
But I know you've got an explanation
You're an angel
Oh oh, oh oh, ohEmbed
