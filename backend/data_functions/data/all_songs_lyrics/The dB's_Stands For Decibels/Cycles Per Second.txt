Cycles Per Second Lyrics
Never too certain
What is to follow
Exhilaration
Then comes the pressure
From to A to Z in

Cycles per second
Cycles per second

Talk in a riddle
Several hertz
Some hypnagogic
Turn for the worse
Having a good time

Cycles per second
Cycles per second
Forging a neuronic aperture

Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ah
It’s got a hold on you
Tell me how to make it stop
Call a depression
Transient thing
(Transient thing)
Can’t move a finger
Refuel a drink
From Y to B in

Cycles per second
Cycles per second
Gorging a neurotic appetite

Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ah
It’s got a hold on you
Tell me how to make it stop

Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ah
Cycles per second, ahEmbed
