Playmate Of The Mouth LyricsSkeptic at the feast in ashes
Huntsmen at the voyeurs' ball
Funeral parlour guests invited
Mourning poorly worn by all
Old and mouldy words of passion
Savage Rose destroyed them all
Wrote her fate in neon captions
Slender sender made me crawl
Playmate of the Mouth expected
Passionata bless the small
Baby sandwich soaped for comfort
Slippery sliding ten feet tall
Playmate of the Mouth expected
Passionata bless the small
Baby sandwich soaped for comfort
Slippery sliding ten feet tallEmbed
