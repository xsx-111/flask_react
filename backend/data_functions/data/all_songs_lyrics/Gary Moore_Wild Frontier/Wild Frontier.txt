Wild Frontier LyricsI remember the old country
They call the emerald land
And I remember my home town
Before the wars began
Now we're riding on a sea of rage
The victims you have seen
You'll never hear them sing again
The Forty Shades Of Green
We're goin' back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
We're goin' back
Back to the wild frontier
I remember my city streets
Before the soldiers came
Now armoured cars and barricades
Remind us of our shame
We are drowning in a sea of blood
The victims you have seen
Never more to sing again
The Forty Shades Of Green
We're goin' back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Those are the days I will remember
Those are the days I most recall
We count the cost of those we lost
And pray it's not in vain
The bitter tears of all those years
I hope we live to see those days again
Now we're riding on a sea of rage
The victims you have seen
You'll never hear us sing again
The Forty Shades Of Green
And I remember a friend of mine
So sad now that he's gone
They tell me I'll forget
As time goes on
We're goin' back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
We're goin' back
Back to the wild frontier (can you hear it callin'?)
Back to the wild frontier (can you hear it callin', callin?)
Back to the wild frontier
Those forty shades of green are calling me back home
Ooh, we're goin' back
Back to the wild frontier
I'm goin' back
Back to the wild frontierEmbed
