Johnny Boy LyricsWhen I hear that wind blow
All across the Wicklow mountains
Is it you I hear a calling?
Johnny boy, oh Johnny boy
When I look to the west
Out across the River Shannon
I can still see you smiling
Johnny boy, oh Johnny boy
When the leaves have turned to brown
And winter's due
As I watch the sun go down
I'll think of you
When I hear that wind blow
All across the Wicklow mountains
Sure it's you, I'll hear a calling
Johnny boy, oh Johnny boyEmbed
