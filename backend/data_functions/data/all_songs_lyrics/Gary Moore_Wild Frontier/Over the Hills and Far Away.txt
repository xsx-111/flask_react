Over the Hills and Far Away LyricsThey came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found
They marched him to the station house
He waited till the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged
"You stand accused of robbery,"
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom
Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be
He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Just where he'd been that fateful night
A secret it must stay
He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom
Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms again he'll be
Over the hills and far away
Over the hills and
Over the hills and
Over the hills and far away
Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom
Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms again she'll be
Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
As sure as the river reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be
Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the sea
Back in her arms is where he'll be
Over the hills
Over the hills and far away
Over the hills
Over the hills and far awayEmbed
