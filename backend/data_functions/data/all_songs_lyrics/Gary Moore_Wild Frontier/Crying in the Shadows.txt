Crying in the Shadows LyricsSometimes he sees her walking by
He never looks her in the eye
She doesn't know, she doesn't care
What he is feeling
And as she turns to walk away
There is nothing he can say
She doesn't know
Why should she care?
When he's alone, she's never there to see him
Crying in the shadows
Of a love he used to know
But now it's all over
Crying in the shadows
Of someone he called his own
But now he's all alone again
Sometimes she sees him walking by
She never looks him in the eye
He doesn't know, he doesn't care
What she is feeling
And as he turns to walk away
There is nothing she can say
He doesn't know
Why should he care?
When she's alone, he's never there
He leaves her
Crying in the shadows
Of a love she used to know
But now it's all over
Crying in the shadows
Of someone she called her own
But now she's all alone again
But he can see it in her eyes
And she can feel it in her heart
Yes, they can feel it in their hearts
It's tearing them apart
Over and over again
Crying in the shadows
Of a love he used to know
But now it's all over
Crying in the shadows
Of someone she called her own
But now she's all alone
Crying in the shadows
Of a love they used to know
But now it's all over
Crying in the shadows
Of a love they used to know
But now they're all alone again
Crying in the shadows
Crying in the shadows of love
Crying in the shadows
Crying in the shadows of love
Crying in the shadows
Crying in the shadows of love
Crying in the shadows
Crying in the shadows of love
Crying in the shadows
Crying in the shadows of love
Crying in the shadows
Crying in the shadows of love
Crying in the shadows
Crying in the shadows of loveEmbed
