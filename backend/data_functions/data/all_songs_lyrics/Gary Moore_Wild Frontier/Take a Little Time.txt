Take a Little Time LyricsI know the reason
You turn your back
On things that you don't wanna hear
I know this feelin'
I get from you
When you try to act so sincere
But I don't know
What's making you behave this way
I'm gonna go
You never hear a word I say
You better learn to
Take a little time
To show me that you care for me
Take a little time
To show me you're still there for me
I know the danger
You're holding all the cards
Because you think I'll wait
You're like a stranger
You better show your hand
Before it gets too late
But I don't know
What's making you behave this way
I'm gonna go
I might as well just walk away
If you don't learn to
Take a little time
To show me that you care for me
You gotta take a little time
To show me you're still there for me
You better take a little time
To show me what's been going on
It's been like this for much too long
Take a little time
Don't hand me all these lines
My eyes are open wide now
Don't give me all your lies
I'm gettin' much too wise for you
Take a little time
Yeah
But I don't know
What's making you behave this way
You never hear a word I say
I might as well just walk away
If you don't learn to
Take a little time
To show me that you care for me
You better take a little time
To show me you're still there for me
You gotta take a little time
To show me what's been going on
It's been like this for much too long
Take a little time
You gotta take a little time
I'm tellin' you
You gotta take a little
Take a little time
Take a little time
Take a little
Take a little time
You gotta take a little
Take a little
You gotta take a little
Take a little time
I'm tellin' you
Take a little
Take a little time
Take a little
Take a little timeEmbed
