Strangers in the Darkness LyricsOh, strangers
He gets this feeling
It's there within, each time he wakes
This empty feeling
Before too long, he'll start to shake
You see him after midnight
On the city streets
He turns away
To hide his eyes from those he meets
Strangers in the darkness
You see them everywhere
She's just a young girl
She's left her home for better times
She's made the wrong friends
She's turning to a life of crime
She sells her fading beauty
To the passers by
She tries to hide
That faroff look
It's in her eyes
Strangers in the darkness
You see them everywhere
So many strangers in the darkness
Why is it no one seems to care?
Ooh, strangers in the darkness
Strangers in the darkness
They found him after midnight
On a city street
A young man with a problem
That he couldn't beat
Strangers in the darkness
You see them everywhere
So many strangers in the darkness
Why is it no one seems to care?Embed
