Friday on My Mind LyricsMonday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Come on Tuesday I feel better
Even my old man looks good, huh
Wednesday just don't go
Thursday goes too slow
But I've got Friday on my mind
Gonna have fun in the city
Be with my girl, she's so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is outa' sight to me
Tonight, I'll paint it red
Tonight, I'll lose my head
Tonight, I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind
Do the five day drag once more
Know of nothing else that bugs me
Now I'm working for the rich man, huh
But I'll change his tune one day
Tonight I'll get mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cause I've got Friday on my mind
Gonna have fun in the city
Be with my girl, she's so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is outa' sight to me
Tonight, I'll paint it red
Tonight, I'll lose my head
Tonight, I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind
Yeah
Gonna have fun in the city
Be with my girl, she's so pretty
Gonna have fun in the city
Gonna have some fun
Be with my girl she's so pretty
Gonna have some fun
Gonna have fun in the city, hoh
Gonna have some fun
Be with my girl she's so pretty
In the city tonight
Gonna have fun in the city
Be with my girl she's so prettyEmbed
