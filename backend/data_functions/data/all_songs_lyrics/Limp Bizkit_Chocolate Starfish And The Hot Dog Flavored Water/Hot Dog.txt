Hot Dog Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen
Introducing the Chocolate Starfish
And the Hotdog Flavored Water
Bring it on
Get the fuck up
Yeah, check, one, two
Listen up, listen up
Here we go (Here we go)

It's a fucked up world (World) and a fucked up place (Place)
Everybody's judged by their fucked up face
Fucked up dreams (Dreams), fucked up life (Life)
A fucked up kid with a fucked up knife
Fucked up moms (Moms) and fucked up dads (Dads)
It's a fucked up cop with a fucked up badge
Fucked up job (Job) with fucked up pay
And a fucked up boss, this a fucked up day
Fucked up press (Press) with fucked up lies (Lies)
While Lethal's in the back with the fucked up eyes

Hey (It's on)
Everybody knows it's on
Hey (It's on)
Everybody knows it's on
Ain't it a shame that you can't say "fuck"? (Fuck)
Fuck's just a word and it's all fucked up
Like a fucked up punk (Punk) with a fucked up mouth (Mouth)
A nine inch nail,, I'll get knocked the fuck out
Fucked up AIDS (AIDS) from fucked up sex (Sex)
Fake-ass titties on a fucked up chest
We're all fucked up, so what you wanna do
With fucked up me and fucked up you?

You wanna fuck me like an animal
You'd like to burn me on the inside
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug
Just know that nothin' you do will bring you closer to me

Ain't life a bitch? (Bitch) A fucked up bitch (A bitch)
A fucked up sore with a fucked up stitch
A fucked up head (Head), it's a fucked up shame
Swingin' on my nuts is a fucked up game
Jealousy fillin' up a fucked up mind
It's real fucked up like a fucked up crime
If I say "fuck" two more times
That's forty-six "fuck"s in this fucked up rhyme
Hey (It's on)
Everybody knows it's on
Hey (It's on)
Everybody knows it's on

You wanna fuck me like an animal
You'd like to burn me on the inside
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug
Just know that nothin' you do will bring you closer to me

Listen up, baby
You can't bring me down
I don't think so, I don't think so
You better check yourself (Check it)
Before you wreck yourself
Kiss my starfish, my chocolate starfish, punk
Kiss my starfish, my chocolate starfish

You wanna fuck me like an animal
You wanna burn me on the inside
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug
Just know that nothin' you do will bring you closer to me14Embed
