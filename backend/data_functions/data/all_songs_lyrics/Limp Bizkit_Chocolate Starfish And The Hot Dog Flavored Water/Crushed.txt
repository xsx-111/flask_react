Crushed LyricsIt's Limp Bizkit
And this is how we learn
You can't talk to me
You're not supposed be, in my face
So get the fuck outta my face
Why you insist?
You gotta talk that shit
You gotta keep that dog-ass breath
All up in my face
But I remember when
You would never lie to a friend
Cause you were so high
You were so shy
You were so fucked up anyway
Life keeps on tickin'
Tickin' tickin' into the future
Cause this is how we learn
Somebody better stop me
Or at least stop this beat
Before we start getting outta hand
Cause this is how we learn
And this is how we burn
Somebody better stop me
Or at least stop this beat
Before we start getting outta hand
Cause this is how we learn
And this is how we burn
You can't erase me
I'm alive as I can be, in your face
So get the fuck outta my face
Why you insist?
Just gotta turn out like this
You're gonna burn out like this all up in my face
But I remember how
You said you want it all and you want it now
Cause you were so young
You were so dumb
You were so fucked up anyway
Life keeps on tickin'
Tickin' tickin' into the future
Cause this is how we learn
Somebody better stop me
Or at least stop this beat
Before we start getting outta hand
Cause this is how we learn
And this is how we burn
Somebody better stop me
Or at least stop this beat
Before we start getting outta hand
Cause this is how we learn
And this is how we burn
Think about it (think about it)
Think about it (think about it)
Oh my (oh my), where you at (where you at)?
C'mon(c'mon)
I know you feelin' it baby (feelin' it baby)
I know you feelin' that (feelin' that)
C'mon
Freak baby, freak freak baby (baby)
Freak baby, freak freak baby (baby)
And this is how it should be done (be done)
And this is how it should be done (be done)
Cause my styyyyyyyyyyyyle is identical to none
(Identical to none)
Outta here (outta here)
I'm getting' the hell outta here (hell outta here)
Limp Bizkit style (Limp Bizkit style)
Hey Lethal wait up (hey Lethal wait up)Embed
