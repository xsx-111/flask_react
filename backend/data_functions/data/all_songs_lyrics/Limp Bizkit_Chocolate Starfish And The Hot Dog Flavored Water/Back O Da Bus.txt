Back O Da Bus Lyrics
Don't wanna go, don't wanna go
Don't wanna go, don't wanna go

I don't wanna do this by myself
Can't help to think this ride won't last too long for me
Move so long and the mileage that I gain
Is to touch you and leave myself a name

Nobody said it was gonna be easy
Nobody said you would always be lost inside
Nobody said it was gonna be easy
Nobody said you would always be lost (Lost)Embed
