Snake in Your Face LyricsYeah! Word up!
(yeah word up dog)
Somebody's in the house
(in the house)
Colicab in the house!

I bust silly, crazy, cool on the microphone
Can't stop the tone when I'm in the zone
I'll be slicker and quicker then a wet street
I bust muthafuckas up that try to bust of me
You word up! I can't be stopped
Every word I say has got letters in it
You better be afraid Of my unstoppable money
I got all the bitches 'cause I'm so funny
The snake says "Hey!", the snake says "Ho!"
'Cause the hoes know the power of the Bass control
End control? Can't be stopped!
'Cause a bass in your face is like the snake

Give me the bass
Like a bass in your face
Like a can of mace
Ride the snake
Give me the bass
Like a bass in your face
Like a can of mace
Ride the snake
Bring me the bass
The bass in your face
Can of mace, snake
Bring me the bass
Like the bass in your face
Can of mace
Ride the snake
Bring me the bass
Ridin' the snake
Yeah! bring me the bass
Ride the snake! (x5)
Base in your face! (x3)
The snake is in the house!1Embed
