The One Lyrics
Dead from all the loneliness and this is how I feel
Understanding everything has never been my deal
Maybe you have crossed my path to live inside of me
Or maybe you're the reason why I'm losing all my decency

But I believe that you and me
We could be so happy and free
Inside a world of misery
And I believe that you and me
We could be so inside of you, inside of me
'Cause this could be the one

This could be the one
This could be the one
This could be the one

I've been lookin', lookin', lookin', I've been lookin'
I've been lookin' for my Mrs. Right, but she don't exist
Chemistry is everything, and we're anything but this
Maybe I have crossed your path and swept you off your feet
Or maybe I'm the reason why you cry at night before you sleep
But I believe that you and me
We could be so happy and free
Inside a world of misery
And I believe that you and me
We could be so inside of you, inside of me
'Cause this could be the one

This could be the one
This could be the one
This could be the one

But what do you think? We could give it a try
'Cause you never know, maybe we could be soul mates
But maybe not, but maybe so
If you never try, then you'll never know
The grass could be greener
And it will always be greener on the other side
But you just never know
(This could be the one)

But I believe that you and me
We could be so happy and free
Inside a world of misery
And I believe that you and me
We could be so inside of you, inside of me
'Cause this could be the one
This could be the one
This could be the one
This could be the one

But maybe so (Maybe so)
But maybe not (Maybe not)
Who knows? (Who knows?)

If you're alone, I know why
If you can hide, then go hide away
But I want you to stay, hey
And blow me away, away
I want you to stay and blow me away, away
If you're alone, don't you cry
If you can hide, then go hide away
I want you to stay and blow me away your way, your way2Embed
