My Generation Lyrics
If only we could fly
Limp Bizkit style
John Otto, take 'em to the Matthews Bridge
Can you feel it?
My g-g-generation, get up!
My g-g-generation, are you ready?

Do you know where you are?
Welcome to the jungle punk, take a look around
It's Limp Bizkit, fuckin' up your town
We downloaded the Shockwave
For all the ladies in the cave to get your groove on
And maybe I'm the one
Who flew over the cuckoo's nest but guess who's next?
Generation X, generation Strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane

So go ahead and talk shit, talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit about my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck, and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me and my generation
Hey kid, take my advice
You don't want to step into a big pile of shit
Captain's drunk, your world is Titanic
Floating on the funk, so get your groove on
And maybe I am just a little fucked up
Life's just a little fucked up
Generation X, generation Strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane

So go ahead and talk shit, talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit about my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck, and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me and my generation
'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck, and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me and my generation
'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck, and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me and my generation

Who gets the blame?
You get the blame and I get the blame
Who gets the blame?
You get the blame and I get the blame
But do you think we can fly?
Do you think we can fly?
Do you think we can fly?
Well I do, I do
Fly!
DJ Lethal! Bring it on!
Oooh yeah, come on!

So go ahead and talk shit, talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit about my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck, and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me and my generation
'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck, and
We won't ever give a fuck until you
You give a fuck about me and my generation

Oh yeah!4Embed
