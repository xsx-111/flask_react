All Alone Lyrics
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)

Leviticus, oh!
Deuteronomy!

Snatch a piece of my wonderin', distant-far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like, skin of my boot like
Fly in my soup like, "Where's the waitress?"
Can I take this? Really, can I finish this?
These airs and all these graces
It's my mistake, I'll make it
J-dub to the boom, now make it
Bounce, wiggle, bounce, wiggle, shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cutthroats, bound to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain, this ain't no game
I'll show no shame, I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted Cain, I'll twist again
I'll push the blade, as plain as day
Known to what these sayers say, known to what these doers do
It's you and who and you-know-where, we's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear, we happy on we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart, it's start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach, the soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth over, return of the ogre!
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be, come and save the night
'Cause I don't believe
When the morning comes, it doesn't
Seem to say an awful lot to me

All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)21Embed
