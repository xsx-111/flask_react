Kids with Guns Lyrics
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Taking over
But they won't be long
They're mesmerized
Skeletons

Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to

Drinking out (Push it real)
Pacifier (Push it real, push it)
Vitamin souls (Push it, push it real)
The street desire (Push it real, push it)
Doesn't make sense to (Push it, push it real)
But it won't be long (Push it real, push it)

Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to
Now they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire, it's all desire, it's all desire

Drinking out
Pacifier
Sinking soul
There you are
Doesn't make sense to
But it won't be long

'Cause kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to

Now they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire, it's all desire, it's all desire
Push it, push it real (It's real)
Push it, real (Real)
Push it, push it, push it real (It's real, real)
Push it, real (Real)
Push it, push it, push it real (It's real)
Push it, real (Real)
Push it, push it, push it real (It's real, real)
Push it, real (It's real)
Push it, push it, push it real (It's real, real)
Push it, real (Real)
Push it, push it, push it real (It's real, real)
Push it, real (Real)
Push it, push it, push it real (It's real, real)
Push it, real
(Push it, push it, push it real)

I don't know what I'm gonna do
Oh, oh, oh, oh
After day, after night come
Don't, don't kill me now
After night come day
Oh, oh, oh
After day, after night come
Don't, don't kill me now
Oh, oh, oh, oh35Embed
