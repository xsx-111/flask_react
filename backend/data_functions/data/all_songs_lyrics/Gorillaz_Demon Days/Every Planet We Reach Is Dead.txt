Every Planet We Reach Is Dead Lyrics
I lost my leg like I lost my way
So no loose ends
Nothing to see me down
How are we going to work this out?

Dreams are bad, our heads are mad
I love the girl
But God only knows it's
Getting hard to see the sun coming through
I love you
But what are we going to do?

Picture I'm a dreamer, I'll take you deeper
Down to the sleepy glow
Time is a low
Don't you know?
What are we going to do?

When we go down
For all the sacred selfless days
Only left with heartache
I want to see you again
I love you
But what are we going to do?
