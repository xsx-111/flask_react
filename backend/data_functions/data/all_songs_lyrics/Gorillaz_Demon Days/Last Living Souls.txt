Last Living Souls Lyrics
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

Take a gun, or how you say
That's no way you behave
You're just alone when you begin
To sing a song that doesn't sing
It grows (Hey)
You know

Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

Are we the last to get away
To a sun, another day?
Or do we know what we know?
It doesn't seem to be conveyed that way

Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Could go the last living soul
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Lord, save me

'Cause all out of song
I got it down and wrong
I see myself to get
The long all-seeing road down
You come and take a sound
I bought the car made up
The coldest man
He doesn't say it's wrong

We go to the car
I see you walk into the fog
And when you get there, what do you see?
You fit the last you need on me

'Cause we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
Yeah, we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls20Embed
