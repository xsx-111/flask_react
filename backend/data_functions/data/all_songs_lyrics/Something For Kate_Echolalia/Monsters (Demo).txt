Monsters (Demo) LyricsI was hanging upside-down from the overpass
Waiting to discover something about the world
I couldn't get with the program, and I couldn't listen to them
It was like trying to think in reverse
And I don't want to slide into apathy
And I don't want to die in captivity
But these monsters follow me around, hunting me down
And try to wipe me out
Wipe me out
Wipe me out
Wipe me out
I was hiding away underwater
Waiting for distance and buying some time
Trying to be two-hundred-thousand years younger
So I could excuse myself from humankind
'Cause I don't want to be a container
Or a bastard with a ten-page disclaimer
But these monsters spin me around, get me down
Just try to shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out
Hold it in your head
Hold it in your head
Hold it in your head
Believe in make-believe
In me, believe...
Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me outEmbed
