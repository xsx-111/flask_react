Folded Paper Boats Lyrics
I know it's you
Or some reflection of you
It's always you
Over silver waves we sail
In folded paper boats we made
With every word
We would never say

In one place
At one time
I knew you better than anyone
In that place, at that time
I knew that I was someone

Your ability to see everything romantically
Your sound's so low
I never hear it changing me
So I follow you along
To the sound of every useless love song
I've heard them all
I've heard them all

In one place
At one time
I knew you better than anyone
In that place, at that time
I knew that I was someone
I knew that I was someone
And I knew that I was someone
Over silver waves
Folded paper boats we made
Carry every wish
We never dared makeEmbed
