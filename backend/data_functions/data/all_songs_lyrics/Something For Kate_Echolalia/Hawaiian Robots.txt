Hawaiian Robots LyricsI could barely recognise myself sitting there, for question
I was tryin' to guess my name and my favourite colour
But your guess is as good as mine
We had an idea, a brilliant idea
Washed in fluorescent light
But the light here is good and I can taste the food
And I'm better off, I'm better off
I'm better off as a robot
I'm better off in Hawai'i
I'm better off as a robot
I'm better off in Hawai'i
I'm better off as a robot
I'm better off in Hawai'i
I'm better off as a robot
I'm better off in Hawai'i
I, I, I could barely recognise myself sitting there, like a patient
I was tryin' to work out who was you and who was me
And how this happened
I've got an idea, a brilliant idea
Hiding in my boat somewhere
I'll be writing in the sand with a battery in my hand
To keep them goin', and I'll be better off
Ooh...
I'm better off as a robot
I'm better off in Hawai'i
I'm better off as a robot
I'm better off in Hawai'i
I'm better off as a robot
I'm better off in Hawai'i
I'm better off as a robot
I'm better off in Hawai'i
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...Embed
