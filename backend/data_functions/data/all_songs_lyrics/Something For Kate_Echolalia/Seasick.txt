Seasick LyricsYou make it look so easy
You seem to fit inside your own skull so comfortably
But I haven't been myself lately
And thank you
The pressure has been all mine
As I wait for my pulse to catch up with me
If I could leave here today, then I would
If I could change my face and my name, then I would
If I could run to some technicolour place, then I would
If I could learn from my mistakes, then I would
The lights come back on
And what has my imagination done for me lately?
I sit in this chair
Concentrating on a crack in the ceiling and
And thank you, thank you
The pressure has been all mine
As I wait for my pulse to catch up with me
If I could see with your eyes, then I would
If I could change my face and my name, then I would
If I could run to some technicolour place, then I would
If I could learn from my mistakes, then I would
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I would...
I would...
You make it look so easy
Yeah, you make me s-s-seasick
If I could leave here today, then I would
If I could change, then I would
If I could run, then I would
If I could fly, then I would
I wouldEmbed
