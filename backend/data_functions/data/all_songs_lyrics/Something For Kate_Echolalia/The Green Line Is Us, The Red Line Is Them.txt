The Green Line Is Us, The Red Line Is Them LyricsLights go out, half past day
Insects come out to play
It's this heat, it makes everybody crazy
Through the void, weightless, drifting
Windows down, volume blasting
One by one, a memory
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
Folded page, friendly fire
All this talk wrapped in wire
Yeah, I know something you don't know
They say you look different
I say I've seen different
As clear in my mind as it's ever been
One eye always on you
One eye always on the door
One eye always on you
One eye always on the door
You looked at the ground
We're trapped and can't get out
Nervous by themselves
Take these things, and keep them
Sing to them, and keep them
One eye always on you
One eye always on the door, on the door
One eye always on you
One eye always on the door, on the doorEmbed
