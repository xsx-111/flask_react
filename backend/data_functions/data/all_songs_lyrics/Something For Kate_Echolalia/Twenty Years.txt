Twenty Years LyricsHe is alive and kicking, and screaming
Calls it gymnastics
Calls it velocity
You spend twenty years climbing
And never change your mind, or change direction
And you call it the path of least resistance
You have everything you ever need
So you sing, "if you can't beat them, join them"
All the way up to your floor
Memorise and repeat it
And sing it like you mean it
They are talking to me
And I am nowhere to be found
There's somewhere else I had to be
Call it necessity
Mutiny, entropy
They think I'm down, they tell me I should brighten up
That's just 'cause they don't know an explosion when they see one
And they sing, "if you can't beat them, join them"
All the way up to your floor
Memorise and repeat it
And sing it like you mean it
All the way home to your front door
Yeah, you'd better believe it
Sing it like you mean it
They are talking to me
And I am nowhere to be found
So you sing, so you sing
"If you can't beat them, join them"
All the way up to your floor
Memorise and repeat it
And sing it like you mean itEmbed
