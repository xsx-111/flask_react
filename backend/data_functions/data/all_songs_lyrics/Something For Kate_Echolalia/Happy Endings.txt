Happy Endings LyricsThis town makes my mind slow down
Got lines in my face like highways now
Chasing breezes, kicking boulders
And all of the while, just getting older
I leave pieces of paper
Pieces of myself along the way
Out the window, out the window
And I tell myself that
I'll come back for them before I go
Then I won't sing this song tomorrow
Reason calls, I'm never listening
There's always something more distracting
And you take everything so seriously
Then you leave and burn up on re-entry
For happy endings
All these little victories
Gathered up and hung on the wall like trophies
I tell myself that
I've been down this road before
So I won't sing this song anymore, anymore, anymore
Hey...
Ooh...
I said I've been down this road before
So I won't sing this song anymore, anymore
Said I've been down on myself enough before
So I won't sing this song anymore
Ooh...Embed
