Say Something LyricsTonight is like Space Invaders
There is nothing at work
The faces have become like traffic
Multi-purpose conversation
I stand like a lighthouse
I have become a lighthouse
But if we met, it would exhaust this place
If you spoke, then this world would short-circuit
Say something
Make it a direct hit
Say something
Make me never forget
I don't want to stand and compute
I want days and weeks to burst out of you
I am listening for dear life
I want you to talk like it's a breakthrough
Oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh....
Say something
Make it a direct hit
Oh, say something
Make me never forget this, this
Say something
Say something
Say something
Say something, ooh...1Embed
