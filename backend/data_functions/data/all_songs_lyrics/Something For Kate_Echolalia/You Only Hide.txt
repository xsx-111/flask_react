You Only Hide LyricsSo I keep watch
And you keep breaking
Breaking formation to become someone else
And your eyes become corridors
Where I wander with a candle
Calling out to you
And you only hide
Because you know I'll find you
You say that you just wanna feel
The way you used to feel
The way you should feel
And I wander, I wander through
The lost city of you
And you only hide
Because you know I'll find you
And you only hide
Because you know I'll find youEmbed
