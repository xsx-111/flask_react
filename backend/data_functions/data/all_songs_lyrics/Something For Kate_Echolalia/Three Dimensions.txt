Three Dimensions LyricsYou're not the first to think that everything has been thought before
I spoke to an echo and he said
"I'm not satisfied, I want something more."
'Cause I am bored with three dimensions
I'm in love with three dimensions
And if I listen to the seconds
Reminds me of echolalia
What now?
Fragments are found
In the mess and in the sound
'Cause I am bored with three dimensions
I'm in love with three dimensions
And if I listen to the seconds
Reminds me of echola-la-la-la-la-la-lalia
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...
You're not the first to think
You're not the first to think
That I am bored with three dimensions
I'm in love with three dimensions
And if I listen to the seconds
Reminds me of echola-la-lalia
Echola-la-lalia
Echola-la-lalia
Echola-la-lalia
EcholaliaEmbed
