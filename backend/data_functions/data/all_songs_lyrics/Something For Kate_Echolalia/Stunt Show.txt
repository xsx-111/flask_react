Stunt Show LyricsYou hold me in mid-air, and you keep me a measure from impact
You stop and ask me if the ringing in your ears might be the sound of thought
You're like a long slow accident
Time stood still while motion emptied you out
And I watched you like a slide show
1, 2, 3, 4, and there you go
We all stop and stare from start to finish
Yeah, we're measuring again
You keep trying to show us how you can carry fifty times your own weight
You've got a whole new story but you're bound to your invention like a ball and chain
And I watched you like a stunt show
Hold my breath
And here we go
How will you get yourself out of this one?
You stand by watching
And this is how your life is turning out
How will you get yourself out of this one?
Yeah, you stand by watching
And this how your life is turning out
Oh, oh...
Oh, oh....
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh....
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh....
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
How will you get yourself out of this one?
Yeah, you stand by watching
And this is how your life is turning out
How will you get yourself out of this one?
Yeah, you stand by watching
And this is how your life is turning outEmbed
