Whatever You Want (Live at the Chapel) LyricsThank you. Uhh, this song is about believing everything you read and turning into a goldfish
Picked the wrong time to be looking up at the night
Popular belief came down
Destroyed his house and claimed his sight
Move forwards in locks, then barely able to draw breath
Yeah, curiosity killed the cat
And he's buried alongside every great mind we never had
I'm sorry, I know it's only rock and roll
But I've felt this twinge in the back of my mind
And you do not have a monopoly on the truth
Believe everything you read
And in twenty years, we'll put you behind glass
For all the people to come and see
They'll be rolling in the aisles
Whatever you want
Whatever it is you haven't got
You're sentimental
Knowing when you get on that road
I've got no idea where you're going
I've got no idea
Oh, where you're going
Ooh...
Ooh...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Yeah...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Before you jump, you'd better think twice
No angel's gonna appear to offer you advice and
Whatever you want
Whatever appeals to whatever it is you haven't got
You're sentimental
Knowing
Sentimental
Knowing when you get on that road
I've got no idea where you're goingEmbed
