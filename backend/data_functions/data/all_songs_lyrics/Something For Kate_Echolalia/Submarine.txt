Submarine LyricsI listen to you breathe
Quiet winds that send you on your way
Away to a dream
Another time, a nothing time, another day
I wish I could see
The oceans that your eyes will never know
I wish I could be
Somewhere in the undertow
And you, in your sleep
Diving down to follow me
And you, in a dream
You talk in your sleep
Quiet words that spin around my head
So let me be
Fading down the waking world, and there
You know where I'll be
You know where I'll be
And you, in your sleep
Diving down to follow me
And you, in a dream, oh...
Oh...
And you, in your sleep
Diving down to follow me
And you, in a dream, oh...
Oh, oh...
Ooh...Embed
