Jerry, Stand Up LyricsJerry, stand up
Pull back the curtains and let some light in
Quit your job
'Cause you hate it and it's wasting you
Once upon a time, you were running
Singing to the ground every morning
Once upon a time, you were...
Jerry, stand up
Am I the only one who's noticed that you've been missing?
Remember yourself, man
Remember that you have chance and possibility
Once upon a time, you were running
Singing to the ground every morning
Once upon a time, you were crazy
Oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh...
Jerry...
You're not getting any younger
All you need is fresh air, a nice new suit
A walk in the park every day or two
Fresh air, a nice new suit
A walk in the park every day or two
Fresh air, a nice new suit
A nice new suit and a walk in the park every day or two
Every day in every way
Every day...
Once upon a time, you were running
Singing to the ground every morning
Once upon a time, you were crazy
Crazy...
(Once upon a time, you were)
Crazy...
(Once upon a time, you were)
Crazy...
(Once upon a time, you were)
Crazy...Embed
