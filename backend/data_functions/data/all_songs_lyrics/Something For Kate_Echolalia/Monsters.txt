Monsters Lyrics
I was hanging upside down from the overpass
Waiting to discover something about the world
I couldn't get with the programme
And I couldn't listen to them
It was like trying to think in reverse

And I don't want to slide into apathy
And I don't want to die in captivity
But these monsters follow me around
Hunting me down, trying to wipe me out

Wipe me out
Wipe me out
Wipe me out

Yeah, I was hiding away underwater
Waiting for distance and buying some time
Trying to be two hundred thousand years younger
So I could excuse myself from humankind

Cause I don't want to be a container
Or a bastard with a ten page disclaimer
But these monsters spin me around
Get me down, just try and shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out

Hold it in your head
Hold it in your head
Hold it in your head
Believe and make believe and make believe

(Shut me out) I was hiding away underwater
(Shut me out) Waiting for distance, waiting for time

(Shut me out) And I don't want to slide into apathy
(Shut me out) And I don't want to live in captivity

Ooo, ooo
Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out1Embed
