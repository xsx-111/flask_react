A Remarkable Lack Of Foresight LyricsSome kind of chasm in my head
Instruments destroyed and assembled again
Hollywood is talking and I am not listening
'Cause it doesn't mean anything
Just like pipelines humming
They are all mesmerised at thought-through lies and those airbrushed eyes
Every footstep to you might be you
Every footstep to you might be you
Every footstep to you might be you
Dropped too soon
He came in
Left us with nothing
We've got to keep on watching
We just keep on watching
Every footstep to you might be you
Every footstep to you might be you
Every footstep to you might be you
Dropped too soon
Some kind of chasm in my head
Instruments destroyed and assembled again
Every footstep to you might be you
Every footstep to you might be you
Every footstep to you might be you
Dropped too soonEmbed
