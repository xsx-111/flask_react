Old Pictures LyricsLet these pages fly away
Flagpoles in the sun
Same Saturday
And reflected off the window is where you'll stay
Where you'll stay
I turned you in
I turned you into whispers
I turned you in
I turned you into old pictures
I turned you in
I turned you into whispers
I build you out of nothing to have you near
I remembered you on trains
So now you're on every train I hear
I turned you in
I turned you into whispers
I turned you in
I turned you into old pictures
I turned you in
I turned you into whispers
I turned you into old pictures
I wished that you were gone
So you're gone
Let these pages fly away
Flagpoles in the sun
Same Saturday
And reflected off the window is where you'll stay
Where you'll stay
I turned you in
I turned you into whispers
I turned you in
I turned you into old pictures
And I turned you in
I turned you into whispers
I turned you in
I turned you into old pictures
And whispersEmbed
