Beautiful Sharks (Live At The Hi-Fi) LyricsHe was tracing outlines in the air
To make it perfectly clear
He is swimming with some beautiful sharks
Entertaining the man behind the bar
The man behind the bar
And I was there
And somebody was talking about luck
And I thought
I thought, "what if my luck ran out?"
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh!
Hottest night in twenty years
He is playing out a ceremony
Playing out a ceremony
Watch him turn on the spot
To see his memory from a different angle
He eased the element of surprise
To curve and sweep lines
And he is singing an old song
He is swimming with some beautiful sharks, yeah
And I was there
And somebody was talking about romance
And I thought
I thought, "what if my luck ran out?"
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oohEmbed
