Dreamworld LyricsThe Breakfast Creek Hotel is up for sale
The last square mile of terra firma gavelled in the mail
So farewell to those Norfolk Island pines
No amount of make-believe can help this heart of mine
(End...)
Your dreamworld is just about to end
(Fall...)
Your dreamworld is just about to fall
Your dreamworld will fall
So shut that buckle and turn that key again
Take me to a place they say the dreaming never ends
Open wide, drive that mystery road
Walk through Eden's Garden and then wonder as you go
(End...)
Your dreamworld is just about to end
(Fall...)
Your dreamworld is just about to fall
Your dreamworld is just about to fall
The sign says 'honeymoon to rent,'
Cloudland into dreamworld turns
The sun comes up and we all learn
Those wheels must turn
(End...)
Your dreamworld is just about to end
(Fall...)
Your dreamworld is just about to fall
End...
Your dreamworld is just about to end
Fall, fall...
Your dreamworld is just about to fallEmbed
