Chapel St Etc. (Live at the Chapel) LyricsAll that's hurting
Every word is
Just a little less than
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera
It travels like a wave
Almost the exact same
Just when it came
All the wires and springs and machinery that held you in place
Have fallen out of the air into the ocean
All of the above
One after another, all after each other
Locked into a line
People from above
Falling into one piece, holding each other's leash
Halls and exhibits, an exhibition
Wheels set to roll, set to roll
Just a little less than
Special effects and camera tricks
With mirrors and lights that make you look so real, and yet
The camera rolls on its tracks
Alongside your car
And hears the soundtrack
Here it is, here it is, here it is
All of the above
One after another, all after each other
Locked into a line
People from above
Folding into one piece, holding each other's leash
Holding, holding each other's leash
Folding into one piece
Thank you!Embed
