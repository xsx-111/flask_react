White LyricsYou think of white
Somewhere outside
Somehow connected to your brain
Or about to knock on your door
Eternity is a policy
Magnetism and mystery
Wishful thinking and fantasy
And I hope that you're not hoping for me
You think of sight
And reason collides
Somehow transmitting from space
Asking you to line up and take your place
Infinity is a reality
Life jackets and sympathy
Bullshit daydreams
I know you can't be knowing for me
And I hope that you're not hoping for me
Ah, ah, ah, ah...
Ah, ah, ah, ah...
Ah, ah, ah, ah...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...Embed
