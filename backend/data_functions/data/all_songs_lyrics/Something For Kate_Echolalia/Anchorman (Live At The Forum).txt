Anchorman (Live At The Forum) LyricsYou've never met someone you've never met
It's okay, it happens to someone you've never met
So you can stay, you can remain fearless
You can hurt
You don't know what
What you don't know can't hurt you
So at least today
You can remain fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
I remember you from the bar;
Charity gathering, five star
I saw you swimming inside a star
That was ready to blow us all apart
Like strong and distant moonlight
The anchorman's voice
The anchorman's voice
The anchorman's voice
Like strong and distant moonlight
The anchorman's voice guides me through the night
Like strong and distant moonlight
The anchorman's voice guides me through the night
The anchorman
The anchorman
The anchorman
Anchorman
Anchorman, anchorman, anchormanEmbed
