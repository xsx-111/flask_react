Like Bankrobbers (Live At The Forum) LyricsYou've never been better
But you've been acting a little strange
You're like some terrorist
Reading battle plans behind my back
And I know you'll be beside me
At the frontline
Like the hopeless romantic you are
You and I, like bank robbers
We couldn't think of something real to do
Could you?
Ran away to leave the circus
And you had to be outrageous, and you had to be different
And you had to take me too
You and I, like bank robbers
Caught off-guard
Doomed from the start
Caught off-guard
Doomed from the start
You and I, like bank robbers
Only people so desperate
Can be so
So frightened, determined
We're so determined
It's frightening
It frightens me
You and I, like bank robbers
We take what's not ours
And while we destroy the evidence
We leave a trail of leaves
Leading us back, leading us back
Leading us, leading us
You and I, like bank robbers
Caught off-guard
Doomed from the start
Caught off-guard
Doomed from the start
Doomed from the startEmbed
