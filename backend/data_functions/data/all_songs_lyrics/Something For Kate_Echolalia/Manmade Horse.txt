Manmade Horse LyricsAsk me how I am, ask me how I've been
And then stand and watch and hope and wait, and with any luck
I'll be an earthquake
And I will clear a space here
Where you can put pictures and silence and sleep
And you can stop asking 'cause you'll be
You'll be
You'll be
You'll be
Down in the centre of the earth with me
Now you see me
Now you don't bother looking twice
I picture myself like a column of smoke
When questioned, I see myself riding around forever on a manmade horse and you
And you...
You'll be
You'll be
You'll be
Moving randomly
You'll be
Yeah, you'll be
And now you see me
Now you don't bother looking twice
(Don't bother looking twice)
So you can go
Through a wall
Keep it secret
Try not to grow
You can do it, do it
Do it...
Yeah...
You'll be
Riding around forever
You'll be
Riding, riding
Riding around forever, forever
Riding around foreverEmbed
