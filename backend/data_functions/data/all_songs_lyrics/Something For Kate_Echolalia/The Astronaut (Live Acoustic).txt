The Astronaut (Live Acoustic) LyricsClap your hands, click your fingers, sing along, whatever
Either side of a thin blue line
Is a collection of satellites
Singing circles
Singing words that don't mean anything
But they keep me in orbit
And they keep me ashore
Ooh, I can see you
Ooh, on a clear night...
High up in a window
You're an astronaut, you're amnesia, you're a joke
Fingertips against the windscreen
You're on your way, you're on your way
But you can't look at both sides
Of the coin at the same time
And you can't make up your mind
Ooh, I can hear you
On a clear night, I can see you
Singing circles away
Yeah, I'll blow you out of the sky
If you won't get yourself down here
Get yourself down here
Yeah, I can hear you
On a clear night, I can see you
Singing circles away
Thank you!Embed
