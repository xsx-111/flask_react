Altair 4 LyricsAt Hilly's show
They didn't know
That the Ending of "Being" is near
I can feel their voices
The old man cries
"Please save the boy
He's caught in a world far behind
From home"
Monster Anne is crying out
"Feel my pain I can't escape"
Bad chances for me
Altair 4
Altair 4
Altair 4
Chosen by their whispering words
What is left behind?
When purple colours turn to black
Can you feel it?
Is there time?
Can you see it?
Is there life?
"Fly away and dream"Embed
