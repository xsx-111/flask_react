Traveler in Time LyricsThe Morning Sun of Dune
The Morning Sun of Dune
The holy war's
Waiting for
The morning sun
The morning sun
The morning sun
The morning sun
The morning sun of Dune
There's no tomorrow
The apparation of this land and its dream
Makes me feel I have seen it before
I can taste there is life
Everywhere you can find
In the desert of my life
I see it again and again
And again, again, again, again
Dark tales has brought the Jihad
Like whispering echos in the wind
And I'm a million miles from home
Traveler in Time
Knowing that there's no rhyme
Traveler in Time
Knowing that there's no rhyme
The morning sun is near
First light of dawn is here
The morning sun is near again
The Fremen sing that
Their kingdom will come
And I'm the leading one
Battlefields on our crusade
Filled with Sardaukar
Killing machines crying
In raising fear they're hiding
Where do we go now?
So where is the way?
When I'm a million miles from home
Traveler in Time
Knowing that there's no rhyme
Traveler in Time
Knowing that there's no rhyme
The morning sun I feel
All pain and sorrow
The apparation of my words in these days
Makes me feel I have told them before
All my plans will come true
I'll control destiny
In the desert of my life
I've seen it again and again
By my dreams I must find a way
To stop the raging war
I've to choose now
I will leave
My body and seek
And time will stand still
When I have to leave
My body and find
A way back to the world I love
When I'm a million miles from home
Traveler in Time
Knowing that there's no rhyme
Traveler in Time
Knowing that there's no rhyme
