The Last Candle LyricsGuardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Have you forgotten him?
Far from the land
Where the sun is born
Down in the wood "Caladon"
Do you know the place
Where the light is never seen
And all the hopes are turned
By the final cry
Turned to Stone
Turned to Stone
Turned to Stone
Turned to Stone
Whispering tunes in the wind
All hopes are gone with the night
When the old man will never come back
Remember his words and his songs
And we see the raven's flying in the distance
But no wizard's singing his song
Somebody's out in the night
I fly in time
The last candle will burn
There's hope for everyone
When the last candle burns high
Oh, it's time for life
The elves and gnomes have to hide
When the moon is showing its face
And raging orcs will set their traps
And the forest will burn
They hate green trees
And love the dark
They don't understand
That they're caught and left alone
They feel the magic in the wind
They just fear the old man's song
Somebody's out in the night
I fly in time
The last candle will burn
There's hope for everyone
When the last candle burns high
Oh, it's time for life
Corrupted old gnome
Betrayer of all
You know so much about all
What is your price?
Gnome:
"Too much, too much
You cannot pay with your silver and your gold
There's just a little chance to save the wizard's life
There's just a little chance for all you fools
Now pay"
And so I walk across the land
And hope to hear the wizard's song
Somebody's out in the night
I fly in time
The last candle will burn
There's hope for everyone
When the last candle burns high
Oh, it's time for life
Somebody's out in the night
I fly in time
The last candle will burn
There's hope for everyone
When the last candle burns high
Oh, it's time for life
Somebody's out there
I feel there is somebody
Somebody's out there
I feel there is somebodyEmbed
