Journey Lyrics

Life and love, and peace in my heart
Hallelujah, joy springs
And every day, a brand new start
Hallelujah, joy springs

With his problem
May he live my life, even there youâ€™re with me
With this song of praise I sing
Hallelujah, love is everything

Life and love, and peace in my heart
Hallelujah, joy springs
And every day, a brand new start
Hallelujah, joy springs



Life and love, and peace in my heart
Hallelujah, joy springs
And every day, a brand new start
Hallelujah, joy springs

With this prayer I lay
Do you love my life, even one you would kill?
With this song of praise I sing
Hallelujah, love is everything

Life and love, and peace in my heart
Hallelujah, joy springs
And every day, a brand new start
Hallelujah, joy springsEmbed
