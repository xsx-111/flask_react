Testify LyricsIn the morning, as the sun rises in the sky
I remember as the light opens up my eyes
Love returning like a flower from a winter of yearning
Love returning like a song rising in my heart
Now I know what your love means to me
I'm worth more than this love
Oh the sweet love song it sings
I remember as the sun falls into the night
Love returning like a flower and singing

At the sunset, all can see the beauty of our star
Final moments when the light bends color through the sky
Oh, the wonder, all the glory of a lifetime now ending
As the darkness clouds our eyes
Wisdom then appears
All we are comes from the light you give
Because of love, just love, all that we need is within
Now the dawn breaks, there's my star
Sing as light comes through
On the journey, love will guide us right to you
Love and light
Thank you
All I ever wanted to do was find you, find you
All I ever wanted to do was find you, find you in my life
Love, love and light
Love, love
I've been looking for you
I've been looking for youEmbed
