Fists of Fury Lyrics
I use hands
To help my fellow man
I use hands
To do just what I can
And when I'm faced with unjust injury
Then I change my hands
To fists of fury


Our time as victims is over
(Our time as victims is over)
We will no longer ask for justice
(We will no longer ask for justice)
Instead we will take our retribution
(Instead we will...)
Our time as victims is over
(... we will, will take our retribution, will take our retribution, yes we will)
We will no longer ask for justice
(I don't think you heard me...)
Instead we will take our retribution
(...but our time as victims is all over)
(Yes, it's over y'all)
Our time as victims is over
(We will no longer ask for justice)
We will no longer ask for justice
(Instead...)
Instead we will take our retribution
(...we will take our retribution)
(Whoa...)
Our time as victims is over
(... everyday, yeah)
We will no longer ask for justice
(Oh yeah)
Instead we will take our retribution
(Yeah)
Our time as victims is over
(Ooooh)
We will no longer ask for justice
(Oh yeah, all right)
Instead we will take our retribution
(Whoa oh-oh yes)

I use hands
To show my friendliness
I use hands
To give a kind caress
I've fought the strong
I did right for wrong
When I changed my hands
To fists of furyEmbed
