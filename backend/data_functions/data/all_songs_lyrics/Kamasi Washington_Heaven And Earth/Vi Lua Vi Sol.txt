Vi Lua Vi Sol Lyrics

Moon, for your love, I tilt the earth for you
Moon, don’t you know my words are true?
Moon, for your heart, I count the stars for you
Love true

Earth, for your love, I lift the stars for you
Earth, can’t you see I cannot lie?
Earth, for one kiss I’ll make the sky turn blue
Love true

Sun, for your love I'd paint Mars red for you
Sun, have you heard one word I say?
Sun, two more of you I’d bravely stand next to you
What I’d do

Babe, I may like that I might cheat your fate
Babe, can you tell I’m all for you?
Babe, for your love, I think I'm  to you
Love true



Moon, for your love, I tilt the earth for you
Moon, don’t you know my words are true?
Moon, for your heart, I count the stars for you
Love true

Earth, for your love, I lift the stars for you
Earth, can’t you see I cannot lie?
Earth, for one kiss I make the sky turn blue
Love true

Sun, for your love I paint Mars red for you
Sun, have you heard one word I said?
Sun, to hug you I’ll make the galaxies move
Come true

Space, how they lie and how they see your face
Space, can you tell my love for you
Space, for your love my big time now to you
Love true
