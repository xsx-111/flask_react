Will You Sing Lyrics

If I went and changed these things for good
Will you sing
If my words can bring God's rule to life
Will you sing
If your voice is all we really need
Will you sing
If your sound can set those captured free
Will you sing
With our song one day we'll change the world
If you sing
So much strength in what God gave to us
Will you sing




If I went and changed these things for good
Will you sing
If my words can bring God's rule to life
Will you sing
If your voice is all we really need
Will you sing
If your sound can set those captured free
Will you sing
With our song one day we'll change the world
If you sing
So much strength in what God gave to us
Will you sing
With our song one day we'll change the world
Will you sing
So much strength in what God gave to us
Will you singEmbed
