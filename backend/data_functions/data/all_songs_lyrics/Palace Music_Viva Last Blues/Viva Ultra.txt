Viva Ultra LyricsShe's my lifeblood
She's my secret sharer
Always been around this place
And when I call her
It's not long before she comes
To where I'm calling from
Do I hate her?
Do I know her just to hate what she does?
Are you jealous of the show we put on?
Are you wary? Is there justice?
Is there something which resembles pleasure?
And are you mammals?
Do you eat and drink the same as we do?
Oh!, it's OK not to say
Is there time still?
Time to forage for a decent dinner here
Where we've settled
Where we've come to call the new century in
And when I wake up, I do not ask her
If she know just where we lay ourselves
It's better that way, and so it's this way
That we start our day today
Oh!, it's OK, not sayEmbed
