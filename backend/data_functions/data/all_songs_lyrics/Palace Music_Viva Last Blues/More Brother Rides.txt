More Brother Rides LyricsMention of the stars reduce us back
They, about them, have time's things hanging;
We are around near the railroad track
Checking out the thundering
Names you call could have been ours
To call and live among them;
Friends come by and spend some hours
And then back down to working...
At night, things come and half a life
Not so silly walking
All different clothes in the half light
And a halting way of talking
There really was one way to be
Yet this is not it, we think
To be such younger folk as we
Not levelled as we drink
We're busted up, so ragged down
And kissing and subsisting;
Our eyes glint wild and roll around
And the dog, he whines insisting
He asks that we allow the sex
To make us unrecognizable;
That we allow slow violence
To prove us rebaptizable2Embed
