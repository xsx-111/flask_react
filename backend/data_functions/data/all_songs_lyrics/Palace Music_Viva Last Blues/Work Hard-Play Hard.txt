Work Hard/Play Hard LyricsDon't you know that I work hard?
Don't you know that I play hard?
Don't you know it's a hard way?
Trace the buslines in the state
Don't you know that I see she'd strip for me?
Well we're moving around
Me and she have a grasp on coming down
And we do it the same
In the name of glory, filth, and fame
Things are going ok
Find a little puppy love makes a day
Once in the morning and once at night ah
Don't you know that I work hard?
Don't you know that I play hard?
Don't you know it's a hard way?
Trace the buslines in the state
Don't you know that I see she'd strip for me?
Me and Frankie, we cry
Some evenings outside where we lie
Will another one come?
Will we go tonight into the sun?
So to a couple anew
Times like that, it's the only thing to do
Once in the morning and once at night
Oh you know that I work hard
Don't you know that I play hard?
Don't you know it's a hard way?
Trace the buslines in the state
You know that I see she'd strip for me ahEmbed
