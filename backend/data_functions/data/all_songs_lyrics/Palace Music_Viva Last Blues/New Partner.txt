New Partner LyricsThere's a black tinted sunset with the prettiest of skies
Lay back, lay back, rest your head on my thighs
There is some awful action that just breathes from my hand
Just breaths from a deed so exquisetly grand
And you are always on my mind
And you are always on my mind
And you are always on my mind
And you are always on my mind
Well, I would not have moved if I knew you were here
Its some special action with motives unclear
Now you'll haunt me, you'll haunt me
Till I've paid for what I've done
It's a payment which precludes the having of fun
And you are always on my mind
And you are always on my mind
And you are always on my mind
And you are always on my mind
But hello, I've got a new partner riding with me
I'v got a new partner, hello
Now the sun's fading faster, we're ready to go
There's a skirt in the bedroom that's pleasantly low
And the loons on the moor, the fish in the flow
And my friends, my friends still will whisper hello
We all know what we know, it's a hard swath to mow
When you think like a hermit you forget what you know
And you are always on my mind
And you are always on my mind
And you are always on my mind
And you are always on my mind
I've got a new partner, riding with me
I've got a new partner, riding with me
I've got a new partner, riding with me
I've got a new partner now1Embed
