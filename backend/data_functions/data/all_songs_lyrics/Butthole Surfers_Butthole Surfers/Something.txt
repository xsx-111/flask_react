Something LyricsSomething she said to me last night
Something she said to me
I saw the sun rising up over my daddy's grave
And I ate some cheese and rice today!
Something she said to me last night
Something she said to me
She's been talking, talking behind my back
This time she's gonna bleed!
You talking to me?
You talking to me?
You talking to me?
You talking to me?
You talking to me?
Hey, you talking to me?
Yeah, you talking to me?
Something she said to me last night
Something she said to me
I saw the sun rising up over my daddy's grave
And I ate some cheese and rice today!
Something she said to me last night
Something she said to me
She's been talking behind my back again
This time she's gonna bleed!
Something she said to me last night
Something she said to me
'Cause when I kicked her in the teeth she was out of the door
I just know she'll be back for more!Embed
