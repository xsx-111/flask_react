Wichita Cathedral LyricsWiped-out wasted Wichita
Watch out where I am
The last time I'm in Wichita
I did not give a damn
Wiped-out wasted Wichita
Cathedral probably know
Last time I'm in Witchita
My God, I did not know
Wiped-out wasted Wichita
My backside is a scab
Last time I'm in Wichita
The best I ever had
Wiped out Indian souls of mine
One found in Wichita
Last time I'm in Wichita
My God I feel so fucking wiped out
Wiped out in this soul of mine
These deeds I cannot say
Last time I got wasted there
I had to walk away
Wiped-out beachy geechy geech geech
Geetchee gitcheeta
Last time I got crumbled up
The crow he lost his caw
Wiped-out wasted Wichita
Cathedrals on my mind
Last time I got wasted there
My poor dog just went blindEmbed
