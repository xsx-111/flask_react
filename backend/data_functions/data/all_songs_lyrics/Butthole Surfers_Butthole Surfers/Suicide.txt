Suicide LyricsI got a stiff upper lip because I'm half-dead!
The walls of my life are crumbling around me!
I'm running and I can't hide
And I might try fucking suicide!
 so I can't see
I try to be straight but it's not me
Don't touch my body, listen to us
No, no, no, no no no
I'm running, baby
Get away
Somebody to go to, man
Back then
Walking tall, I won't be long
With matching  on telephone
And in my dreams, see the dust
No, no, no, no no no
So watch it, woman
No place to hide
Get a God complex
Suicide!
I can't breathe!
Do you, baby
I will be fine
Suicide
Look, it's time to stop this pain
, I'm half-insane
I've done it now, kill the pain

So get back, world
On my head
'Cept for the donkey, man (?)
Half dead
Walking tall and I won't be long
With matching  on telephone
And in my dreams, see the dust
No, no, no, no no no
So watch it, woman
No place to hide
Get a God complex
Suicide!
I'm not fucking kidding, man, it hurts!1Embed
