Hey LyricsHey
Hey, hey
Hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Well, I don't know
And you can't say
But even if you could
You wouldn't anyway
Let's go to Hell
Hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey
Now I'm in love
Not with he or she
It's a burning hate
Why don't they see?
Get your hands off me
Hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey
I'm burning out
Like a falling dove
Cause I'm not fit
To fall in love
Love?
Hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey
A broken wrist
A swinging arm
A lover's kiss
And I am goneEmbed
