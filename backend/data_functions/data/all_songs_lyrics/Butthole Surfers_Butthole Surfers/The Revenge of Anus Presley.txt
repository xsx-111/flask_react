The Revenge of Anus Presley LyricsYour pain makes me hungry!
I'm hungry for pain!
Your death is mine, motherfucker!
Don't even try to escape!
Because you're mine!
You are all mine!
You're all in my grasp!
I will peel you like a potato!
I will take off your brains and throw them to my dogs!
Oh shit, you're gonna die!
I'm gonna peel off your toenails like they were...cupcakes!
Like they were... Twinkies!
You're dead, motherfucker!
My life is nothing but to kill you!
Revenge is Mine!
My words make youse wanna scream
Like a dead dog dying from anger--and pain--of a dead dog!
Uhhhhhh...
We're gonna kick some ass tonight, motherfucker!
Life!
Life is mine!
I take it with me!
I take you, I crumble you up, I wad you into a little ball!
My bitch picks its teeth with your head!
And still it has a bad smile!
Life!
Life is mine!
Yup! Revenge is mine!
My war jacks off when it sees your revenge!
My war is not alone!
It's the only war!
Any time you get your ass down there
Kick my ass, no problem!
My life is better!
Don't fuck with me whatsoever!
Yup! Revenge is mine!
I take it and I leave it!
But this one, motherfucker, is mine!
And you're getting it!
You're the one that's gonna pay this time, buddy!
No prob!Embed
