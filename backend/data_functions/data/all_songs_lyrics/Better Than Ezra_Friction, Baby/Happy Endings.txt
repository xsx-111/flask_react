Happy Endings LyricsAnd though you will say I'm wrong
It's much easy with you along
Sundays were made for this
Seeing bond give the villain a kiss
Holding your face in the glow
Play on, play on...
Happy endings
I thought that you'd like to know
I'm finally letting her go
You always said tell me when
You're ready at last to begin
Learning to chance it again
Play on, play on...
Happy endings
So let the them all dissolve
Welcome the new resolve
Here's where the credits run
Riding off into the sun and love is real
Reading your eyes in the glow
Play on, play on...
Happy endingsEmbed
