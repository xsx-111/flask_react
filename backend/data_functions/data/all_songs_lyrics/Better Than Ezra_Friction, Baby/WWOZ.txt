WWOZ LyricsWWOZ is on in stereo
A string of flowers haloed around your head
Candle light, Ceiling fan
Curtains blow away and back again
Back again
Don't wake me, I think I'm in a dream
Sleeping is easy
I used to lay in bed for hours
I've waited a lifetime now maybe I'll learn
Calling back and forth through heavy air
The barges sound their warnings in the dark
Peace comes like a trusted friend
As it starts to rain again fall away
Fall away
So don't wake me, I think I'm in a dream
Now sleeping is easy
I used to lay in bed for hours
I've waited a lifetime now maybe I'll learn
Sleeping is easy
I used to walk the streets for hours
I've waited a lifetime now maybe I'll learn
Let go of you fear, let's grow old together
Find a place along the way
Let's reel through the years
Each makes the other better
But what thoughts can I call allies
When this circle of ribs keeps working on its own?
Chorus:
WWOZ's on in stereo. Well it's on in stereoEmbed
