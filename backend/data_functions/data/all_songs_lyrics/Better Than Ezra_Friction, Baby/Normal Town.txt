Normal Town LyricsI still remember
You dressed in grey
Working undercover
For the CIA
You were cursing Silber
Living in Back Bay
Sailing on the Charles
When I heard you say
Let's go down
To Normal Town
Let's go down
To Normal Town
Right down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
I washed you lover
And scrubbed your face
Running from Miss Porter's
You showed up one day
From a flat in South End
Where you made me strong
You said we're running out of both ends so I came along
Let's go down
To Normal Town
Let's go down
To Normal Town
Right down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Hey
Wouldn't it be great?
Never worry 'bout your future
Never askin' why
Hey hey
In a subdivision
Watching television
And out lives go by
Let's go down
To Normal Town
Let's go down
To Normal Town
Right down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, downEmbed
