Still Life With Cooley LyricsEverybody talking saying you will be walking
This neighborhood will never be the same
You said we'd understand
You found out what's happening now
So we all sat down and you broke the news
CHORUS
Now Daddy don't love her anymore
It's still life with Cooley
Now Daddy don't love her anymore
It's just still life with Cooly
All your friends show on time
They come bringing red wine
You said if it's over then we'll go in style
You better best take care keep one hand to your ear
So you're not left hanging when they're finally gone
CHORUS
Watcha saying?
You're going to stay of at St. Madigan's?
(reeled in again)
You're just fooling around fooling around
People hanging with their good friends
Listening to those old songs
CHORUS
Now Daddy don't love her anymore
It's still life with Cooley
Now Daddy don't love her anymore
It's just still life
It's just still life with CooleyEmbed
