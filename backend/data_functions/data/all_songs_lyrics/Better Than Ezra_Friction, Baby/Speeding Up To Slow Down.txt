Speeding Up To Slow Down LyricsIf they calm you down
Then excite them
If they call you out
Then ignore them
You're speeding up
You're speeding up
To slow down
When they all believe
You reject it
When they all are for
Be against it
You're speeding up
You're speeding up
To slow down
If they call you out
They-will tear you down
When your world falls in
Then they'll leave you dry
You're speeding up
You're speeding up
To slow down
Down, down, down ...Embed
