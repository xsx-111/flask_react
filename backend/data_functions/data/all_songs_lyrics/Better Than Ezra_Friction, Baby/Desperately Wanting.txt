Desperately Wanting Lyrics
Passed the road to your house
That you never called home
Where they turned out your lights
Though they say you'll never know

I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting

When they pumped out your guts
Filled you full of those pills
You were never quite right
Deserving all the chills
Said the worst is over
Take it over again
Then they ask what went wrong
When they turn you on again
Don't they turn you on again

I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting
I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting
Kick them right in the face
Make them wish they weren't born
If they bring up your name
Well they'll say you won war
Baby burst in the world
Never given a chance
Then they ask what went wrong
When you never had it right
No you never had it right

I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting
I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting

Oh, the letters I've dropped off
Though they say you got them all
Finally figured out some things you'll never know
Take back your life
Let me inside
We'll find a door
If you care, if you care to anymore
I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting
I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting1Embed
