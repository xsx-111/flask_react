Scared Are You? LyricsStrong hands
Big plans
All reduced to this
Hard won freedom
How could you have missed
Scared, are you
You do it on your own
You do it all alone
We all did
Scared, are you
Half the lines we make up dear
The best that you can do
Everything you would be
Passed you like a ghost
And kind words are scarce at best
When you need them most
Scared, are you
You do it on your own
You do it on your own
We all did
Scared, are you
Half the lines you make up here
The best that we can do
Hope brings you luck
Doors opened up
And if you should fall
I'll catch you dear
It must be
It must be
Scared, are you
Finally on your own
You do it all alone
We all did
Scared, are you
Half the lines you make up dear
The best that we can do
And we do
And we do
We do
We do
And we do
And we do
And you do
And you doEmbed
