King Of New Orleans LyricsGot an angel on the stairs
As if you'd even care
When the lights are up
And the sun had nearly gone down
Did you see him on the street?
Did you pass him at your feet?
Did you think at all, "How dare they even look me in the eye"?
And he loves the girls
And he loves the boys
Going to make twenty dollars
Before the weekends over
So set him up
To let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of New Orleans
Got a ticket to a show
Going to see him take a blow
When the drunk one said
"Cat Stevens was the greatest singer!"
And did you kick him in the head?
Did you see the blood run down?
Did you laugh at all, when the people walked right by and said aloud
"Gutter punks are all the same
Probably make twenty dollars 'fore the weekends over?"
So set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of New Orleans
Set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of New Orleans
Radio in my head
Radio in that car
Going down again
He's going down again
Anyway you look
Anyway you talk it over
It's easier
To let it slip out of your mind
But it rips your heart out
Then it kicks your head in
Just give him one more chance
Try to see the beauty in his world
All the way in on my hands in on my feet and shoulders
Going to make twenty dollars before the weekends over
So set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of New Orleans
Set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of all New Orleans
God save the King of New OrleansEmbed
