Rewind LyricsCut a tape of my favorite songs
Said what I can't face to face
I hoped that you would share all my thoughts
We are young and unimpressed
With all you'd recognize
So play it all over
Turn it wide
Now there is nothing but a
Mix tape left behind
Now it won't rewind
In my care we are superstars
Run you lipstick down your chin
While up ahead we saw such a crash
Right there a song became a soundtrack
For this space in time
So play it all over
Turn it wide
Now there is nothing but a
Mix tape left behind
Now it won't rewind
Wonder is often lost
Jaded at such a cost
Time undermines you when you close your eyes
We pass right by you
So play it all over
Turn it wide
Now there is nothing but a
Mix tape left behind
Now it won't rewindEmbed
