Long Lost LyricsAre you lost?
Do you find life
Turning out not quite the way you planned?
Come around, stay awhile
That's OK
That's alright
Couldn't get to sleep so talk about it
Let's talk about it right now
Here it comes
On my head again
Well I guess I'm born to be the long lost
Friend
Friend
Long lost friend
Are you cold?
Is there no place better, safer, friendlier than this?
Call me up, I'm alone
That's OK
That's alright
Rather it be me than go without it
So don't think about it right now
Here it comes on my head again
I guess I'm born to be the long lost
Friend
Friend
Long lost friend
I've given ballast
Held you up when you were falling down
What happens when I'm not around? Oh
Friend
Friend
Ohoh ooooh
Ohoh ooooh
Friend
Long lost friendEmbed
