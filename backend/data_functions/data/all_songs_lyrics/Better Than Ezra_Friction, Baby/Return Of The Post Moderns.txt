Return Of The Post Moderns LyricsTen cent lovers
Beneath the covers
Riding on a wet dream
Silver tonic free
High stool sweet tarts
Equipped with green cards
Chomp their 401ks
Semi-chocolate brie
Semi-chocolate brie
Digging in Los Cruces for
An army drab container
Carbon dating clothes
For the
Last time they were washed
Shelby and Sheila
Onomatopoeia
Catch (?) hand nal on Banlon
Shiver Martin Sheen
Preschool mothers
In Technicolors
Are fire bombing Dresden
Stanton, Harry Dean
Stanton, Harry Dean
Feeding line caught tuna to
A neutered Bodhisattva
Writhing peaches for
The President
Out on the White House lawn
Beating Herbert Hoover with
A leather tipped
Pinata
Thorn and Katy drink
The milk tinted
Amerasion Green
