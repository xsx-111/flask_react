Hung The Moon LyricsThey say you're off
A bit confused
But when the day is done
I'll be with you
I like your eyes
They say you're true
The others whisper and lie
And you framed the sun
Shot out the stars
You paled the sky
And hung the moon, yeah
They say 'your loss'
That your mind's diseased
But when you finally won
Tell me who always believed
And you framed the sun
Shot out the stars, yeah
You paled the sky
And hung the moon
Down way low
They never remember
Down way low
Down way low
You always remember
Don't let the words you hear leave your head
They say you're gone
That you left today
But if you change your mind
Know I still feel the same way
And you framed the sun
Shot out the stars, yeah
You paled the sky
And hung the moon
You hung the moon
You hung the moon, hey, yeah
You hung the moon, yeah yeah yeah yeahEmbed
