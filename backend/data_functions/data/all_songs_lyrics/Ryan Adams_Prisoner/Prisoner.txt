Prisoner Lyrics
Free my heart
Somebody locked it up
Still waiting on parole
I can taste the freedom just outside that door
Same grey walls
Same grey clothes
Mmm, I know my friends all know
Can't keep it under control

I know our love is wrong
I am a criminal
Mmm, I am a prisoner
Mmm, I am a prisoner
For your love

There's this one bird
Lands on the sill beside the bars
How can something born with wings
Ever know freedom to truly be free
Clock don't know what your memories do
They're stacking up beside the bed
I count 'em every night inside my head
If loving you is wrong
I am a criminal
Mmm, I am a prisoner
Mmm, I am a prisoner
If loving you is wrong
I am a criminal
Mmm, I am a prisoner
Mmm, I am a prisoner
For your loveEmbed
