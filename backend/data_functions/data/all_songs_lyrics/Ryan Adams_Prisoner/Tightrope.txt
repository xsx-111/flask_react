Tightrope Lyrics
Strong winds and my head's on fire
Walk another day across the high wire
I'm on a tightrope, watch it as it swings
Like a countdown ticker on New Year's Eve

We run the numbers spinning in the side
Counting all the reasons that we're broken and we lied
I'm on a tightrope, watch it as it heaves
Heating up the metal, putting pressure on the springs

All I want is for you to make me smile
All I want is for you to drive me wild

Pretty candles on a birthday cake
Covered in confetti with the caffeine shakes
Fuck all the money, everything is trash
Papers in the glove box, light it up and pass

Flip on the tube, we watch it 'til we sleep
Ain't nothing but static and the panics and the feeling manic
I'm on a tightrope, watch it as it swings
Like a countdown ticker on New Year's Eve
And all I want is for you to make me smile
All I want is for you to drive me wild
All I want is for you to make me smile
All I want is for you to drive me wild
Wild


All I want is for you to make me smile
All I want is for you to drive me wild
