Shiver and Shake Lyrics
Midnight coming, I can feel it in the air
I hear your voice, run your fingers through my hair
I reach out for your hand but I know it isn't there
I pick up my phone and I shiver and I stare

Morning coming early every day
I can barely sleep, I been lying here awake
I close my eyes, I see you with some guy
Laughing like you never even knew I was alive

Maybe I'm a fool, doesn't matter anyway
My chest is all tight, my heart still aches
These are the days you need double what it takes
I've missed you so much I shiver and I shake
I've missed you so much I shiver and I shake

I've been waiting here like a dog at the door
You used to throw me scraps, you donâ€™t do that anymore
I miss your loving touch, I miss your embrace
But if I wait here any longer I'm gonna fade away
If I wait here any longer I'll just fade awayEmbed
