Doomsday Lyrics
I could wait a thousand years, my love
I'd wait for you
I could stand in just one place, my love
And never move

As the fire burns around us in the dark
One part is the world and one's my heart

My love, we can do better than this
My love, how can you complicate a kiss?
My love, you'd love me now 'til doomsday comes
'Til doomsday comes

Can you stand and face your fears, my love?
I will for you
I could stand in just one place, my love
And never move

As the fire burns around us in the dark
One part is the world and one's my heart
My love, we can do better than this
My love, how can you complicate a kiss?
My love, I'd love you now 'til doomsday comes

My love, oh, and I don't know
My love, how to let my feelings go
You said you'd love me now 'til doomsday comes

'Til doomsday comes
'Til doomsday conesEmbed
