Anything I Say to You Now Lyrics
Crush it up into a paper ball, let it fly
It hits the wall, hits the trash can on the side
Crush it up into a paper ball, let it go
Anything I ever had to say, it's all gone

Anything I say to you now is just a lie
Anything I say to you now but goodbye
Anything I say to you now is just a lie
But goodbye
But goodbye

Crush it up and let it go to waste, it's not working
Sit and wait for somebody to tell you it's almost done
Crush it up into a paper ball, it's just words
Words that never really added up to much else 

Anything I say to you now is just a lie
Anything I say to you now is just a lie
Anything I say to you now, anything I say to you now
Anything I say to you now but goodbye
Is just a lieEmbed
