Do You Still Love Me? Lyrics
I been thinking about you, baby
Been on my mind
Why can't I feel your love?
Heart must be blind
What can I say?
I didn't want it to change
But in my mind, it's all so strange

Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me? Oh-oh

Another year will pass
I will count the days
Another sun goes down
And I'll never see the rays
What can I say?
I didn't want it to change
Is my heart blind and our love so strange?

Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me? Oh-oh

Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me? Oh-oh1Embed
