Breakdown Lyrics
Thorn in my side
Pain I can't hide
Diamonds that won't shine
Oh, my soul, black as coal

Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feel like I'm racing and I can't come down
Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown

God, did he cry
Tears that don't dry
Tomorrow will come and it'll be alright
Oh, my soul lost control

Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feel like I'm racing and I can't come down
Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown

Was I dreaming did I lose something in, in the night?
Did I lose you? Did I lose you?
Maybe I'm sleeping and in the morning I will only see the sunshine
Did I lose you? Did I lose my mind?
Feels like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feels like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feels like I'm racing and I can't come down
Feels like I'm headed for a breakdown

Feels like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feels like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feels like I'm racing and I can't come down
Feels like I'm headed for a breakdownEmbed
