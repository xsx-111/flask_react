Broken Anyway Lyrics
The problem is what we want to say
What we want to say will just blow us both away
It's ice cold and it just rained
Everything we were is going down in an endless drain

It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken, it was fake
I just close my eyes and shake

Last chance before it slips away
Throw it all away and can't go back again
What was whatever it became?
Whatever, we will still be together in some ways

It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken, it was fake
And I don't know what it meant
It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken anywayEmbed
