Outbound Train Lyrics
How am I supposed to know
When it's time to go
In the middle of the night
When I'm all alone
Don't know what to do
Don't know what I'm even supposed to say
Like a train don’t move
‘Til it starts to roll away

The cars don't move in the middle of the night
Lost inside the void of the fading tail lights
I swear I wasn't lonely when I met you, girl
But I was so bored, I was so bored
I don't know anything anymore

I got this achin' in my chest
Rollin' around like a pile of bones
In a broken little box
It sounds a lot like you
Laughing to yourself
In a quiet room
Our eyes knowing more than they probably ought to
The cars don't move in the middle of the night
Lost inside the void of the fading tail lights
I swear I wasn't lonely when I met you, girl
But I was so bored, I was so bored
I was so sure, I was so bored
I was so bored, I was so bored
I don't know anything anymore

The walls are all cracked
The fan stutters in the room
Where we slept
Where I woke up next to you
Sometimes a man don't know
When he's got to walk away
I hear a rumbling and a moan
I feel like an outbound train

The cars don't move in the middle of the night
Lost inside the void of the fading tail lights
I swear I wasn't lonely when I met you, girl
But I was so bored, I was so bored
I was so sure, I was so bored, I was so bored
I was so sure, I was so sure
I was so sure
I was so sure
I was so sure
I was so sure
I don't know anything anymoreEmbed
