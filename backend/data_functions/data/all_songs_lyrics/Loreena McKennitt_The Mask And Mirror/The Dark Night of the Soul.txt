The Dark Night of the Soul LyricsUpon a darkened night
The flame of love was burning in my breast
And by a lantern bright
I fled my house while all in quiet rest
Shrouded by the night
And the secret stair I quickly fled
The veil concealed my eyes
While all within lay quiet as the dead

Oh, night thou was my guide
Of night more loving than the rising sun
Oh, night that joined the lover
To the beloved one
Transforming each of them into the other
Upon that misty night
In secrecy, beyond such mortal sight
Without a guide or light
Than that which burned so deeply in my heart
The fire t'was led me on
And shone more brightly than the midday sun
To where he waited still
It was a place where no one else could come
Oh, night thou was my guide
Of night more loving than the rising sun
Oh, night that joined the lover
To the beloved one
Transforming each of them into the other
Within my pounding heart
Which kept itself entirely for him
He fell into his sleep
Beneath the cedars all my love I gave
From o'er the fortress walls
The wind would his hair against his brow
And with it's smoothest hand
Caressed my every sense it would allow

Oh, night thou was my guide
Of night more loving than the rising sun
Oh, night that joined the lover
To the beloved one
Transforming each of them into the other
I lost myself to him
And laid my face upon my lovers' breast
And care and grief grew dim
As the mornings' mist became the light
There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair
There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair
There they dimmed amongst the lilies fairEmbed
