Vertical Rhythm LyricsI got the beat
I got the beat
You know I do
Set the right kind of feeling
For the Vertical Rhythm night proof
Wake up after dark
I ain’t no weather man
But I know it’s gonna rain
You’re predictable and typical
Always say the same thing
And you know you do
Out of reach
Out of time
You always seem to be
Outta sight
Outta mind
You always seem to be
Two steps behind
Eye for an eye
Nail for a nail
Tooth for a tooth
What goes around comes back around
You better make the right move
Or you won’t wake up at all
I ain’t no better man
But I know not to complain
You’re so conventional it’s comical
How you always do the same thing
And you know you do
Out of reach
Out of time
You always seem to be
Two steps
Outta sight
Outta mind
You always seem to be
Two Steps behind
Two steps behind
Just when you need it
Just when you fear it
Just when ya think it’s over
It begins again
Just when ya think it’s over
It begins again
Out of reach
Out of time
You always seem to be
Outta sight
Outta mind
You always seem to be
Just when you think you’ve got yourself together
Just when you think you’ve got it made
Just when you think you’ve got yourself together
Just when you think you’ve got it made
Two arms
Meant to hold you
Meant to love you
Do the right thing
Two arms
Meant to hold you
Meant to love you
Do the right thing
Do the right thing
Do the right thingEmbed
