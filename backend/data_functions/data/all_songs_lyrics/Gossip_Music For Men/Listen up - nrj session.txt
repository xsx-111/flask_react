Listen up - nrj session LyricsI warned you, you didn't believe me
I warned you, you didn't believe me
I warned you, you didn't believe me
I warned you and now you're caught
There's some people that you just can't trust
Some people talk way too much
Take my advice and listen up
Don't be a fool like the rest of us, now listen up!
Ooh, on the playground
Ooh, on the playground we learn so much
Now listen up, now gather 'round
Listen up, gather 'round now
1, 2, 3, take it from me
3, 4, so much trouble in store
4, 5, get it right the first time, oh
Count it with me now!
1, 2, 3, listen to me
3, 4, lots of trouble in store
4, 5, get it right the first time, oh
Count it with me now!
Ooh, ooh
Everybody knows someone like that
Who borrows money and won't pay you back
They'll talk about you at the drop of a hat
Lie about it to your face when they're caught
There's some people that you just can't trust
Some people just talk too much
Take my advice and listen up
Don't be a fool like the rest of us, now listen up!
Ooh, on the playground
Ooh, on the playground we learn so much
Now listen up, now gather 'round
Now listen up, gather 'round now
1, 2, 3, take it from me
3, 4, so much trouble in store
4, 5, let's get it right the first time, oh
Count it with me now!
1, 2, 3, take it from me
3, 4, so much trouble in store
4, 5, get it right the first time, oh
Count it with me now!Embed
