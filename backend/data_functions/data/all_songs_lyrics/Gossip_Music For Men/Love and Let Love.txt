Love and Let Love Lyrics(Ah, Push It)
There are pictures of me
Around your room
You come on strong
Too much too soon
And unfortunately
I’m not amused
Don’t get me wrong
Don’t get confused
Ooooooh, ahhhhhhh
This is the last time I love and let love
Ooooooh, ahhhhhhh
This is the last time I love and let love
Yeah, yeah
There are certain things
You can’t for see
I have visions of you
But not with me
You know it’s not like us
To disagree
You’ll get the point
Eventually
Ooooooh, ahhhhhhh
This is the last time I love and let love
Ooooooh, ahhhhhhh
This is the last time I love and let love
It is a long, long way to February
Where the ocean meets the sun
Got me wonderin’ is this necessary
When we’ve only just begun
Ooooooh, ahhhhhhh
This is the last time I love and let love
Ooooooh, ahhhhhhh
This is the last time I love and let love
Ooooooh, ahhhhhhh
This is the last time I love and let love
Ooooooh, ahhhhhhh
This is the last time I love and let love
The grass is greener
The air is sweeter
You have to see her
To believe her
A great deceiver
Won’t help you either
You’re only fallin’
Deeper and deeper
Ahhhh, ooooh, ah, ah, ah
Oooooh, ahhhhhhh
Oooooh, ah, ah, ah
It is a long, long way to February
Where the ocean meets the sun
Got me thinkin’ is this necessary
When we’ve only just begun
It’s a long, long way
Such a long, long way
It’s a long, long way to February
Where the ocean meets the sunEmbed
