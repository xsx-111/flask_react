2012 LyricsOh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You think you are invincible
When in fact you're powerless
You're missing the principal
You'll fear the loneliness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's just like time has stopped
It's always someone's fault
Turn back the hands of the clock
I'll turn into a pillar of salt
A tragedy brings misery
Misery loves company
Company is misleading
I've made it this far
Without you
Without you
Without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So quick to seal our fate
Give it a second chance
We'll hurry up and wait
Victims of circumstance
A tragedy brings misery
Misery loves company
Company is misleading
I've made it this far
Without you
Without you
(Without you)
My heart may never beat again baby
Or have you got the best of me
My heart may never beat again baby
Or have you got the best of me
My heart may never beat again baby
Or have you got the best of me
My heart may never beat again baby
Or have you got the best of me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You think you are invincible
You're missing the principal
You think you are invincible
You're missing the principal
A tragedy brings misery
Misery loves company
Company is misleading
I've made it this far
Without you
Without you
Without you
I've made it this far
Without youEmbed
