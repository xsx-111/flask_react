8th Wonder LyricsThere's an equation
You plus me equals dead
To the science
At those who dare to forget
There was a time
Before girls knew they weren't pretty yet
There was a time
Before boys knew they weren't tough enough
You're the 8th wonder of the world
So don't abuse it
You're just another beating drum
A rhythm for generations to come
You're the 8th wonder of the world
Undisputed
Not just another bleeding heart
But a masterpiece a work of art
It's like a choir
Voices that will never be heard
A desire, share by one in a million people
There was a time
Before girls knew they weren't pretty yet
There was a time
Before boys knew they weren't tough enough
You're the 8th wonder of the world
So don't abuse it
You're just another beating drum
A rhythm for generations to come
You're the 8th wonder of the world
Undisputed
Not just another bleeding heart
But a masterpiece a work of art
And if there's a chance I'll take it
And if there's a risk I'll take it
And if there's a chance I'll take it
And if there's a risk I'll take it
Take it
Take it
You're the 8th wonder of the world
So don't abuse it
You're just another beating drum
A sound for generations to come
You're the 8th wonder of the world
Undisputed
Not just another bleeding heart
But a masterpiece a work of artEmbed
