Heavy cross - nrj session LyricsOooh oooh ooh hooo
Oooh oooh ooh oooh
Oooh oooh ooh hooo
Hooo oooh ooh hooo
It's a cruel cruel world
To face on your own
A heavy cross
To carry along
The lights are on
But everyone's gone
And it's cruel
It's a funny way
To make ends meet
When the lights are out
On every street
It feels alright
But never complete
Without joy
I checked you
If it's already been done
Undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you
To prove it
On the rainy nights
Even the coldest days
You're moments ago
But seconds away
The principle of nature
It's true but
It's a cruel world
Oooh ooh oooh ooh hooo
Oooh ooh oooh ooh hooo
Oooh ooh oooh ooh hooo
Oh hoo woah
We can play it safe
Or play it cool
Follow the leader
Or make up all the rules
Whatever you want
The choice is yours
So choose
I checked you
If it's already been done
Undo it
It takes two
And it's up to me and you
To prove it
Ah ah ah eh aye aye
Oh eh oh oh
Yeah oh oh
Ah ah ah eh ah aye
Oh oh oh
Yeah oh
Yeah oh
Yeah oh
I trust you
It's already been done
Undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you
To prove it
Ah ah aye
Oh hoo woah
Yeah eh
Ah ah ah ah aye
Oh-hoo woah
Yeah oh
Yeah eh
Yeah oh
I checked you
If it's already been done
Undo it
It takes two
And it's up to me and you
To prove it
Ah ah ah ah aye
Oh-hoo woh
Yeah oh oh
Ah ah aye
Oh-hoo woh
Yeah oh
Yeah eh
Yeah oh
I trust youEmbed
