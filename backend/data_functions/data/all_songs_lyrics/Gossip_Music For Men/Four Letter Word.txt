Four Letter Word LyricsPut my best foot forward
Trying to ignore the events of the day
Pacing back and forth
Slowly going nowhere
Running in place
And it looks like it’s gonna rain again
Ohhh another four letter word
Never gonna be the same again
Ohhh another four letter word
Oooooh
Oooooh, oooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooooh
Oooooh, oooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooooh
Staring out my window
Look down at the street below
Children at play
Round and round and round it goes
Where it stops no one knows
Their faces seem to say
That it looks like it’s gonna rain again
Ohhh another four letter word
Never gonna fall in love again
Ohhh another four letter word
Love is a four letter word
That should never be heard
Love is a four letter word
A four letter word
Yeah
L is for leaving
O is for on time
V is for the voices warning me I’ll lose my mind
E is for the ending
The unhappy ending of the four letter word
And it looks like it’s gonna rain again
Ohhh another four letter word
I never want to see your face again
Ohhh another four letter word
Oooooh
Oooooh, oooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooooh
Oooooh, oooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooooh
Yeah
Never gonna fall in love again
Never wanna to see your face again
Never gonna fall in love again
I never wanna see your face againEmbed
