Dimestore Diamond LyricsEverybody knows the things she does to please
Low cut sweaters with her skirt above her knees
She's a dimestore diamond
Everybody knows just where she gets her clothes
A water coloured painting in a renoir pose
She's a dimestore diamond
Everybody knows but no one can tell
A homemade haircut but she wears it well
She's a dimestore diamond
You can call her broke, you can call her poor
But everybody knows that she ain't cold no more
She's a dimestore diamond
Shines like the real thing
Real thing
Real thing
Dimestore diamond
Dimestore diamond
Gotta catch you one
Gotta catch you one one
Gotta catch you one
Gonna get you one
Gonna get you one one
Gonna get you one
Everybody knows the things she does to please
Low cut sweaters with her skirt above her knees
She's a dimestore diamond
Dimestore diamond
Shines like the real thing
Real thing
Real thing
Dimestore...
Shines like the real thing
Real thing
Real thing
Dimestore diamond
Dimestore diamond
