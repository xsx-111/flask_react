Spare Me from the Mold LyricsHut, hut, hut, hut
Hut, hut, hut, hut
Hut, hut, hut, hut
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut
It’s a grueling road to nowhere
Sneaking out the bedroom
Sleeping in the basement
God just get me somewhere
Anywhere, any hole in the ground will work
And who cares if it hurts
’Cause I’ve been through worse
I make the right mistakes
And I say what I mean
Spare Me From The Mold
Steal From the till
Spare Me From The Mold
Steal From the till
Spare Me From The Mold
Steal From the till
Spare Me From The Mold
Steal From the
Hut, hut, hut, hut
Hut, hut, hut, hut
Hut, hut, hut, hut
Hut, hut
Been years of desperation
For a life long sentence
Of repentance
Anxiety
Separation
Pay attention to the wild combination
Of education and desecration
You’ll know when it hits
Spare me from the mold
Steal from the till
Spare me from the mold
Steal from the till
Spare me from the mold
Steal from the till
Spare me from the mold
Steal from the
Hut, hut, hut, hut
Hut, hut, hut, hut
Hut, hut, hut, hut
Hut, hut, hut, hut
Spare me from the mold
Steal from the till
Spare me from the mold
Steal from the till
Spare me from the mold
Steal from the till
Spare me from the mold
Steal from theEmbed
