Men in love - nrj session LyricsShame, shame, shame
Ooh, I, I, I, I, shame, shame, shame
I haven't felt this way
Since I was seventeen
You know what I mean
You're guilty of love in the first degree
Baby, dance like there's nobody looking
Slide, you're coming my way
Shake, like you know what you're doing
We're out all night and sleep all day
Na, na, na, na, men in love
Na, na, na, na, men in love with each other, hey
Shame, shame, shame
Ooh, I, I, I, I, shame, shame, shame
I can't remember having so much fun
When morning comes
Everybody's waking up with someone
On the run
Dance like there's nobody looking
Slide, like you're coming my way
Shake, like you know what you're doing
We're out all night and sleep all day
Na, na, na, na, men in love
Na, na, na, na, men in love
Na, na, na, na, men in love
Na, na, na, na, men in love with each other, hey
Since the beginning of time
Put your hand in mine
Come along and you'll find
It's the perfect crime, oh, oh, oh, oh
Na, na, na, na, men in love
Na, na, na, na, men in love
Na, na, na, na, men in love
Na, na, na, na, men in love with each other
Na, na, na, na, men in love
Na, na, na, na, men in love
Na, na, na, na, men in love
Na, na, na, na, men in love with each otherEmbed
