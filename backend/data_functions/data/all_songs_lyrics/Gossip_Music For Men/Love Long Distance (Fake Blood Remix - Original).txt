Love Long Distance (Fake Blood Remix - Original) LyricsCall yourself a romantic
Let me explain
Been across the whole Atlantic
And back again
I had it with your antics
Your childish games
Baby
I call your number twice
But it rang and rang
Against my best friend’s advice
I should be ashamed
You did it to me once
You'll do it again
So she says
Love long distance
Is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love long distance
Is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
I heard it through the bass line
Not much longer would you be my baby
You work yourself into a panic
Bent outta shape
And then take me for granted
Like nothings changed
All my friends are asking
Why you're that way
But I can't explain
Why I call your number twice
But it rang and rang
Against my best friend’s advice
I should be ashamed
You did it to me once
You'll do it again
She promises
Love long distance
Is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
You're making me crazy
The way that you've been acting lately
I need more of your assistance now
Breaking up or breaking down
When I need you, you can't be found
I want someone who's around for me
Does it have to be so complicated?
Either way I'm devastated
I could use a little comforting
Love long distance
Is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love long distance
Is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love love love love
I need some assistance now
Love
And I will thank you for your cooperation
And I will thank you for your cooperation
And I will thank you for your cooperation
