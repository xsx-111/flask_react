Love long distance - nrj session LyricsCalling yourself a romantic, let me explain
Been across the whole Atlantic and back again
I had it with your antics, your childish games
Baby, I call your number twice but it rang and rang
Against my best friends advice, I should be ashamed
You did it to me once, you'll do it again, so she says
Love long distance is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love long distance is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
I heard it through the bass line
Not much longer would you be my baby
You work yourself into a panic, bent outta shape
And then take me for granted like nothing's changed
All my friends are asking, why you're that way but I can't explain
Why I call your number twice but it rang and rang
Against my best friends advice, I should be ashamed
You did it to me once, you'll do it again, she promises
Love long distance is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
You're making me crazy but way that you've been acting lately
I need more of your assistance now
Breaking up or breaking down, when I need you, you can't be found
I want someone who's around for me
Does it have to be so complicated? Either way I'm devastated
I could use a little comforting
Love long distance is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love long distance is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love, love, love, love, I need some assistance now
And I will thank you for your cooperation
And I will thank you for your cooperation
And I will thank you for your cooperation, stop playing with meEmbed
