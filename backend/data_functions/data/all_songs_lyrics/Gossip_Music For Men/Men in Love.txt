Men in Love LyricsShame, shame, shame
Ooooh I, I, I, I, shame, shame, shame
I haven't felt this way
Since I was seventeen
You know what I mean
Guilty of love in the first degree
Baby
Dance
Like there's nobody looking
Slide
Like you're coming my way
Shake
Like you know what you're doing
We're out all night
And sleep all day
Na, na, na, na
Men in love
Na, na, na, na
Men In love, with each other
Hey
Re Intro
Shame, shame, shame
Ooooh I, I, I, I, shame, shame, shame
I can't remember having so much fun
When morning comes
Everybody's waking up with someone
On the run
Dance
Like there's nobody looking
Slide
Like you're coming my way
Shake
Like you know what you're doing
We're out all night
And sleep all day
Na, na, na, na
Men in love
Na, na, na, na
Men in love
Na, na, na, na
Men in love
Na, na, na, na
Men in love, with each other
Hey
Since the beginning of time
Put your hand in mine
Come along and you'll find
It's the perfect crime
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Na, na, na, na
Men in love
Na, na, na, na
Men in love
Na, na, na, na
Men in love
Na, na, na, na
Men in love, with each other
Na, na, na, na
Men in love
Na, na, na, na
Men in love
Na, na, na, na
Men in love
Na, na, na, na
Men in love, with each otherEmbed
