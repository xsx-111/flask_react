For Keeps LyricsIt's just emotion
I've never had
Emotion
Is makin' me sad
Emotion
Tying me down
It's just emotion
Keeps me hangin' around
It's the he, e, eeeat
Calling Me, e, eee
It's the Ne, e, e, eed
To be Freeeeeeee
Yeah, yeah
I don't wanna play for keeps anymore
This time I'm for real
I've heard it once
I've heard it all before
And now are lips are sealed
Told you I'd never lie to you
You want something different
Something new, oooooh
I don't wanna play for keeps anymore
And there is nothing you can dooooooooooooo
Disappointment
Is the final word
Devotion
Is back breaking work
Emotions
Are irrational
But to ignore them
Would be critical
It's the he, he, eeeat
Calling Me, e, eee
It's the Ne, e, eeed
To be Freeeeee
Yeah, yeah
I don't wanna play for keeps anymore
This time I'm for real
I've heard it once
I've heard it all before
And now are lips are sealed
Told you I'd never lie to you
You want something different
Something new, ooooooh
I don't wanna play for keeps anymore
And there is nothing you can dooooooooooooo
Give me something I, I, I, I, I
Can depend on I, I, I
Give me something I, I, I, I, I
Can rely on
Yeah
I don't wanna play for keeps anymore
This time I'm for real
I've heard it once
I've heard it all before
And now are lips are sealed
I don't wanna play for keeps
I don't wanna play for keeps
I don't wanna play for keeps any more
And there is nothing you canEmbed
