Heavy cross (fred falke remix - radio edit) LyricsOoohh oh ooooh, oh oh oh ohhh
Ooohh oh ooooh, oh oh oh ohhh
It's a cruel cruel world, to face on your own
A heavy cross, to carry alone
The lights are on, but everyone's gone
And it's cruel
It's a funny way, to make ends meet
When the lights are out on every street
It feels alright, but never complete
Without you
I trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
It takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it
All the rainy nights, even the coldest days
You're moments ago, but seconds away
The principal of nature, it's true but, it's a cruel world
Ooooh oooh oohh, ooh ooh oooh ooh, ooo wooah
We can play it safe, or play it cool
Follow the leader, or make up all the rules
Whatever you want, the choice is yours
So choose
I trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
It takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it
Ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye oh oh
Ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye eh, ye eh, ye eh
I trust you, it's already been done, undo it
It takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it
Ei ei ei, woah wo, yeah eh
Ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye eh, ye eh, ye eh
I trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
It takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it
Ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye oh oh
Ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye eh, ye eh, ye eh
I trust youEmbed
