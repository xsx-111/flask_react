Is the Is Are LyricsYou ain't the first to realize
You ain't the first to look in my eyes
Over my head and positive
I have a gift that i’ll never give
You ain't the first
You ain't the first
Last time i walked down this street
I walked down this street
I wanted to die
Die
Now i’m fighting
I feel like i’m fighting
I feel like i’m
Fighting for my life
