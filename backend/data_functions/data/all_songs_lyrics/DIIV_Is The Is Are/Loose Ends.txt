Loose Ends LyricsAll our loose ends
Are gathered here inside this house
You left me here to sort them out
But its not all yours really
I kept a few to hold onto
I tied them to my wrists and you said:
"does it feel watered down?"
"does it feel over now?"
"do you feel watered down?"
"do you feel older now?"
You hated when i said
I needed anything, i didn't
So i walked into your room
And took it allEmbed
