Ye, Renew the Plaintiff LyricsThe sacrifice must be for some unknown deity, babe
I just can't get hard for reality
At least not mine
Your love chariot is like
An immortal bleeding beast and peerless
Can't seem to motivate my heart to function
This age is a bitch that burns our dreams so mercilessly
We can only turn away
I wonder can I produce enough heat
To keep our experiment alive
I turned you off, 'cause I couldn't cope seeing the disappointment in your eyes
Do it!
Oh Nina, how can I defend myself against this world
That batters me like a retarding cartoon?
It's too sick for salvation, but that word is just a joke
Oh Nina, my mood system is chaos
I'm desperate for something, but there's no human word for it
I should be happy, but
What I feel is corrupted, broken, impotent, and insane
Oh Nina, I've become so hateful
How am I ever going to survive this winter?
I can think of nothing but getting my revenge
Make those fuckers pay, but it's not gonna happen and
It's eating a hole in me
Eating a hole in me
It's eating a hole
Eating a hole
Eating a hole in me
In our hive conceit, each suffering repeat
Hostile concession too foul to mention
I've inherited spiritual sanctions for some old ancestral crime
It was committed long ago, but the punishment's absolved all down the family line
Everyone's so unstable, on my mother's side
And emotionally barren, on my father's side
But tell me how can I attempt to atone for somebody else's wilful ignorance?Embed
