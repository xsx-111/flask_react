Authentic Pyrrhic Remission LyricsSo much violence in my head
How are we still alive?
The depression is under control
(No it's not, don't you ever stop lying, damn)
I love how we're learning from each other
You are such a positive
You're so empowering
In your hands, I'm quite simply a different instrument
And you're the only one that ever put money on me
You think that I'd forget so easily?
You emit a charged autumnal vibe
I know we're of the same tribe
The fall's our most productive season
Still a crippling fear has become Caesar and weâ€™re slightly moribund so..
So naturally I want to help you and invoke the architect of salutary memes
Our heads are pregnant with divine mechanics, but oh how we're tyrannized by
Tentacles of their ferine stupidity and it's all so disappointing
But you're different, better
I love how we're learning from each other
You are such a positive
You're so empowering
In your hands, I'm quite simply a different instrument
And you're the only one that ever put money on me
And tried to advance trans-human singularity
I love how we're learning from each other
You are such a positive
You're so empowering
In your hands, I'm quite simply a different instrument
And you're the only one that ever put money on me
You think that I'd forget so easily
I love how we're learning from each other
Every time I listen to my heart
I just get hurt
Until this afternoon, I was a nomad
No country would call me its son
I'd be a refugee, but I have no substance
Asking for papers? I have none
Until this afternoon, I was a pariah
A mongrel, chased and kicked and hit
Hunted even in my dreaming
But there was no crime I did commit
Until this afternoon, I was an exile
And now that word is obsolete
There are no nations, no concept of ego
Our illumination is completeEmbed
