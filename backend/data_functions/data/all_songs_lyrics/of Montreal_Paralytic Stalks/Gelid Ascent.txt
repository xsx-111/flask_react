Gelid Ascent LyricsYou are what parasites evolved from
Still an unanswered question
You are the refused energy from a superior form
Nothing that occurs to you is intended for your involvement
You're an irrelevant effect
Unavoidable, but of low influence
One last thing that you must understand
(To be dead is to be confused, to be mistaken)
You speak to me
Like the anguish of a child doused in flames
Oh, you speak to me
Like the stones that're bashing your skull and brain exposes
Oh it's always been the same
200,000 years of viciousness
The violent art dissolves
A lost, suffering, weak, cracked out species
Oh you speak to me
Like your life was annihilated in space
Oh you speak to me
In a voice that's trite, calm, and impassionate
And yeah, what do you know?
You know nothing of the impuissance of empathy
The straight wretchedness of abandonment
The dehumanizing press of love
Oh you speak to meEmbed
