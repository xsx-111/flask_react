There’s a flush of dead eyed hatred in these
Horse faced hours of ours
Don’t let this be how we’re remembered
The torment of sickly humid inner dialog
Torn to paper shredded cowboy menace
True love never mattered
The two donkey jaws that were removed from our hearing
Refusal!
All the joy of us was absorbed by foreign tribes
Oblique in their mystic bullshit boredom
We are condemned to each other
…has no memory and no message
…something fair and repulsive
…reserve psychosis
…there’s no economy of despair
…if we’re lucky
How can you perform?
How can you operate?
I’m so conflicted
Just can’t see it any other way
Your disillusionment
Why is it my problem?
I don’t know the solution
I don’t have a solution
I’ve tried and I cannot change
I’ve tried
How can you operate?
How can you operate?
How can you operate?
How can you operate?
How can you perform?
How can you operate?
How can you operate?
How can you operate?
How can you operate?
How can you perform?1Embed
