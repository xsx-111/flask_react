We Will Commit Wolf Murder LyricsSomething's terrorized my psyche to get even
Lately you're the only human I believe in
I tried to understand his logic
But there's just no pattern there
No sympathetic voices anywhere
There's blood in my hair
Now I'm considered ugly from every angle
You're the only beauty I don't want to strangle
Can't you hear me crying out for guidance?
(Yes, we hear but we don't care)
There's no sympathetic victims anywhere
There's blood in my hair
I want to get all fucked up and tell you how I really feel
Because your vibrant blackness coco augury is so unreal
When I die I want you to die too
Not trying to stay in this or any dimension without you
Spit on this planet without you
I envy you because you can believe in things like I never could
And not dose yourself into a coma over
The bestiality of our race
Or lament our descent into some ancient reptilian form
Like an agnostic transubstantiation
You wanna know what that is? Use your imagination
Sell it
They paralyzed my psyche to get even
Lately you're the only dancer I believe in
I'm a butcher now with blood in my hair
No sympathetic voices anywhere
There's blood in my hair
Anti human armies spring from every angle
You're the only soldier I don't want to strangle
I can see it's a dolorous fate
(So don't expect us to cooperate)
Anyway, it's five lives too late
And there's blood in my hair
My head is
A most obliging harbor
For this illusion
Will these irish eyes be stung by
Tears of confusion
Will you meet the common end
To your odd shaped mission
Hope it isn’t true
I don’t believe in that kind of god
But still I pray for you
We will produce vanity holocausts
We will commit acts of misery
We will weaponize sightless innocents
Then we'll forget
Someone's terrorized my psyche to get even
Lately you're the only human I believe in
I suffered pompous death to find her kingdom razed
Cherub corpses in the vapor
Martyrs wrapped in butcher paper
And if I’m a monster possessed to mangle
You’re the only dancer I don’t wanna strangle
Can’t you hear me crying out for guidance?
(Yes we hear but we don’t care)
No sympathetic voices anywhere
There’s blood in my hair
I saw you laughing but tomorrow you’ll say you were there
You looked at me in disgust
Girl why should i care?
There’s blood in my hair
There's blood in my hair
There's blood in my hair
There's blood in my hair
Blood in my hair
