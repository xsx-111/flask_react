Spiteful Intervention LyricsIt's fucking sad that we need a tragedy to occur to gain a fresh perspective in our lives
Nothing happens for a reason, there's no point even pretending you know the sad truth as well as I
Oh god, the morning light
Sun rays bring my paranoia
I can't function unless I'm the only one awake
Rancor of our
Last conversation that
Forbidden word you
Deform to
Handicap me then
Abuse your advantage
I'm nervous my soul is returning to crystals
Because your eyes are an agent of darkness
There's nothing to fight
It's just a bit of fait accompli
I spend my waking hours haunting my life
I made the one I love start crying tonight
And it felt good
Still there must be a more elegant solution
Lately I'm rotted in the filth of
Self offered agonies that really should
Fill me with shame
But all I have is this manic energy
I lost my page in being the black stamped disciple in your heart collage
Just want to celebrate me
Need to suffer more
Face our puerility
Converts officiate
Divides new stratagems to
Disembowel our quotidien characters
I spend my waking hours haunting my life
I made the one I love start crying tonight
And it felt good
Still there must be a more elegant solution
I know I'm upside down about you
Your kindness feels like blasphemy or some sick education on the limits of humanity
So I profane the laws of some Victorian garbage
And listen to you smashing up my studio again
I spend my waking hours haunting my life
I made the one I love start crying tonight
And it felt good
Still there must be a more elegant solution
Lately all I can produce is psychotic vitriol
That really should fill me with guilt
But all I have is asthmatic energy2Embed
