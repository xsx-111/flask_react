We've woken up alone
No song to sing us off the edge
The speakers have blown
This planet is an orphanage
Deep abandonment issues at our core
But if not each other
There's fuck all to really keep hustling for
Ain't got no ride
At least not one that returns our message
Our parents aside, this planet is an orphanage
And it cheapens us the way you and I torment each other
It's just the way we combine
It’s time for you to decide here on the concrete
You a winter soldier or just playing yourself and me too?
I got your letter and it hurt me so many ways
Had no breath to respond
Boy you let your brothers down!
You inhabit your own personal ghetto
But no one's forcing you to stay there
Our circle’s not so cannibalistic baby
We've woken up alone
No song to sing us off the edge
The speakers are blown
This planet is an orphanage
Deep abandonment issues at our core
But if not each other
There's fuck all to really keep hustling for
Ain't got no ride
At least not one that returns our message
Our parents aside, this planet is an orphanage
And it cheapens us the way you and I torture each other
It's just the way we collide
It's time to make up your mind, here in this cellar
Are you gonna betray yourself or come join us up on the dais?
The conspiracy that's forever unfolding in your head
It's just not real
Boy you've let your people down
I've murdered so much of myself here
Just to try and accommodate you
You know I saved your life a little too, hey brother
I don't resent you, but
I can't settle the debt of our serrated history
And blows I haven't got over yet
And it cheapens us the way you and I torment each other4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
