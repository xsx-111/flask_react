Deus Lyrics
Deus does not exist
But if he does, he lives above me
In the fattest largest cloud up there
He's whiter than white and cleaner than clean
He wants to reach me

Deus does not exist
But if he does I always notice him
Getting ready in his airy room
He is picking his gloves so gently off
He wants to touch me

I'm walking humbly down a tiny street
Pulling my collar it gets bigger, woo!

I once met him
It really surprised me
He put me in a bath tub
Made me squeaky clean
Really clean

To create a universe
You must taste
The forbidden fruit
He said "hi"
I said "hi"
I was still clean

Deus does not exist
But if he does he'd want to get down from that cloud
First marzipan fingers then marble hands
More silent than silence and slower than slow
Diving towards me

My collar is huge room for two hands
They start at the chest and move slowly down

I thought I had seen everything
He wasn't white and fluffy
He just had side burns
He just had side burns
And a quiff
He said "hi"
I said "hi"
I was still clean
I was squeaky clean
I was surprised
Just as you would be
Deus, Deus
Deus, Deus
