I Want LyricsMy punctuality is well known
When the revolution takes place
I'll be late
And be shot as a traitor
When the revolution takes place
When the sun rises I will not see a thing
I regret nothing, it was worth it
To go through life without an hourglass
It paid off
It paid off profusely
My reward was to be free and alone
Even now tied to the pillar
Blindfold at sunrise
And drums are Catalan beating
My heartbeat keeps up with the drums
But soon my pulse will fade away
My fade away, I smile
For I know when the sun rises
I will not see a thingEmbed
