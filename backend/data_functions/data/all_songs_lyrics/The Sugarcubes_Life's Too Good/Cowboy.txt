Cowboy LyricsEinar
Cowboy, cowboy, in the big town
I'm a cowboy in the big town
I'm looking for my pony
A mans best friend is his pony
Aaah!
I'm a cowboy
Aaah, cowboy!
I need my pony
I lost my pony
In the big town
I'm a cowboy in the big city
Looking for my pony
I'm a cowboy x3
I'm not alone
Not lonely
Not alone
Not lonely
I'm a cowboy
I'm stuck like
A cowboy
In the big city
Bj√∂rk
And he affects me
The odour of his skin, oh
It works in my head
I wanna eat him
I wanna be in him
Einar
I'm a cowboy
Smelt like I sat in
In a tine-mine
Nose is struck
In the back
My back is struck
But who knows I am
I am a
Cowboy!
Cowboy!
On the second floor
On a brass bed
In a big city
I found my pony
But I paid a prize
I got a silver-bullet
Through my heart
I'm a were-cowboy
I am a were-cowboy
A weeere
Weeere-cowboy
A were-cowboy
Were-cowboy
Weeere-cowboy
I am a were-cowboy
Cowboy!Embed
