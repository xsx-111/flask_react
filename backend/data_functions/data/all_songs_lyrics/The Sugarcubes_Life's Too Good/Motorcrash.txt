Motorcrash Lyrics
Riding on my bicycle
I saw a motorcrash
A proper motorcrash
And lots of spectators
I rushed to the centre
Saw the injured parents
Cuts on the children
An awful motorcrash

Dangerous motorcrash
Terribly bloody motorcrash
Destructive motorcrash
Oh, oh, oh

Took the mother
Sneaked with her secretly
Went to my home
And nursed her gently
Put on her bandages, gave her
Milk and biscuits
She sighed pleasantly after this
Awful motorcrash
It's a dangerous dangerous motorcrash
Terribly bloody motorcrash
Destructive motorcrash
Oh, oh, oh

That girl on that bicycle showed great interest
In all the motorcrashes in the neighbourhood
She looked quite innocent

Then we disguised ourselves
Took a taxi to her home
When her husband answered the door
She introduced herself, he said
"Where have you been all this time?"
Oh, oh, oh

But believe you me
I know what innocence looks like
But she showed increased interest
After she got that bicycleEmbed
