Fucking in Rhythm & Sorrow Lyrics
A divorced lady arrives home from a bar
Guess, guess what she sees, sees there
There is a naked person in my flat!
He's got a weird expression on his face!
Oh my god and jesus as well!
W-what are you doing here?
Are you hurting your chest?
Offending yourself?

Forcing yourself into pain and sorrow like there is no tomorrow?
You should use the pain and sorrow
To fill you up with power
Life's both sweet and sour!

He looks at me hopeless with tears in his eyes
Goes out of the window and up on the roof
Naked man, naked man calm down!
I-I'll give you some strawberry cake

Don't act like there is no tomorrow
You should use the pain and the sorrow
To fill you up with power
Life's both sweet and sour!
Life's both sweet and sour!
Life's both sweet and sour!
Life's both sweet and sour!
Don't act
Don't act
Don't act

Like there's no tomorrow!
You should use the pain and sorrow
To fill you up with power
Life's both sweet and sour
Don't act, don't act like there is no tomorrow
You should use the pain and sorrow
To fill you up with power
Life's both sweet and sour

Life's both sweet and sour
Life's both sweet and sour2Embed
