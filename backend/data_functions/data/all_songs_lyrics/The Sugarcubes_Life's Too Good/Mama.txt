Mama Lyrics
I was watching a woman who was walking down my street
Walking with grace, so beautifully carefully
She's a big and pretty mother, big and pretty mother
Swinging her handbag back and forth so joyfully
She's drawing circles with her breasts in her jumper

Give me a big mother, huge and loving one
I can crawl upon and cling to

She's a large woman, warm and cuddly
Wet lady, strong mother
She's walking down the street in front of my window
Whistling funky tunes in the ears of my neighbours

Give me a big mother, one that would always want me
Hot embracing mother, I can crawl upon and cling to

You can't be safer can't be more secure
Than with a breast in each palm
With a breast in each palm
That's the way I was born
And that's the way I want to die
Give me a big mother, soft and wet one
That would caress me
In all those special places
Where's a strong mother
One that squeezes me
One I can crawl14Embed
