Delicious Demon Lyrics
Heeeeeeee-haw!
He-haw!
Heeeeeeee-haw!

One person calls someone
To pour the water
Because it takes two to pour the water
To plough takes two as well
But only one to hold up the sky
To plough takes two as well
But only one to hold up the sky

One plays the harp, beats a rock with a stick
One plays the harp, beats a rock with a stick
Becomes a priest at least, a delicious demon
Least, a delicious demon
Hee-haw, hee-haw!

Delicious demon
Delicious demon
Delicious demon
Delicious demon
Two men need one money
But one money needs no man
One is on one's knees, loses one's head
Except maybe a delicious demon
Hee-haw!

Two men need no money
But one money need no man
(Then one is no longer, then one is no longer)
One is on ones knees, loses ones head
Except maybe a delicious demon
(Then one is no longer)
Then one is no longer, then one is no longer
No longer!

Delicious demon
Ho! Delicious demon
Ho! Demon
Delicious
Look here he comes again, wow!
So delicious demon
Delicious demon
Demon
So delicious!1Embed
