Coldsweat Lyrics
Meat, meat
Blood, blood
Sweat, sweat
Meat, meat

Close the door
Shouldn't burn yet
The wires get hotter
Palms glowing

This is hot meat
Metallic blood
This is hot meat
This is open sweat

I'll show you with my fingers
Draw with the eye
With your own breath
I'll tear your lungs

Here is hot meat
This is metallic blood
Here is hot meat
This is open sweat
Out this side of the blackest meadows
I make my winter dwelling and crush my bones

This is hot meat
This is metallic blood
This is hot meat

I'll sail out the window
I'll walk down the hedge
I will not finish
Till I'm fully satisfied

This is hot meat
This is metallic blood
This is hot meat
This is open sweat1Embed
