Sick for Toys Lyrics
Veik I Leikfang
Ve-e-eik I Leikfa-ang

Sick for toys, sick sick for toys
This girl I know she's sick for toys, sick for toys
She needs a new toy, a brand new toy
She's tired of her old toys
She's got a big house
Full of old toys
What can she do?
She needs a new toy
:
Sick sick sick for toys!
Sick sick sick for toys!
She is sick, sick for toys!

Sick for toys, sick sick for toys
She disposes of her old toys
She badly needs a new toy
And in a small garden she finds a small boy
She smiles, she's happy she found her new toy a small boy
She's sick for toy, she needs a new toy
To watch her comb her hair, comb all of her hair
:
Sick sick sick for toys!
Sick sick sick for toys!
She is sick, sick for toys!

She is sick, sick for toys!
She really is, sick for toys!

Sick for toys, sick sick for toys
This girl I know found a new toy
A boy she used him to watch her comb hair
Day in day out, night in night out
She really was sick for toys
In the end she fell asleep
The boy cut off her hair, all of her hair
She was bald, she might not now be sick for toys!Embed
