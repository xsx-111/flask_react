Traitor Lyrics
But, I'll teach the little angels
I'll take the harp away
But I'll, I'll teach them how to use the harmonica
Something... I'll just do something likeâ€¦

My punctuality is well known
When the revolution takes place
I'll be late and I'll be shot as a traitor

When the sun rises

When the sun rises
I will not see
I regret nothing
It was worth it
Going through life without a timepiece
Did pay off

The sun rises, oh

My reward to be free
And alone even now at the pillar
Blindfold at sunrise
Hearing the drums
Of Catalan beating my time away
The sun rises I will not see

My heartbeat keeps time
With the drums
But soon my only pulse will fade away

The sun rises I will not see

I smile just knowing
When the sun rises
I will not see1Embed
