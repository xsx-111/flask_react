Blue Eyed Pop Lyrics
This blue eyed pop
It's just fabulous to go twisting (twisting)
Boogieing, in beat with (beat with)
The thousand pound

Snare sound

After boogieing
We all crave for a hot-dog splashed with noise (noise)
Queue and spew then back home to our love nest
Need I say more?
Oh! This blue eyed pop is pure ecstasy

This is too much fun, fun, fun
Everyone is so close to laughing
This kind of joy won't last

Something wonderful is about to happen
I feel perfectly ready, don't know yet what it is
I will look here inside this disco
This is so hot, hot!
We melt together like tigers and we are dancing together1Embed
