Birthday Lyrics
She lives in this house over there
Has her world outside it
Scrabbles in the earth with her fingers and her mouth
She's five years old
Threads worms on a string
Keeps spiders in her pocket
Collects fly wings in a jar
Scrubs horse flies
And pinches them on a line
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!

She has one friend, he lives next door
They're listening to the weather
He knows how many freckles she's got
She scratches his beard
She's painting huge books
And glues them together
They saw a big raven
It glided down the sky
She touched it
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Today is her birthday
They're smoking cigars
He's got a chain of flowers
And sews a bird in her knickers
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!

They're smoking cigars
They lie in the bathtub
A chain of flowers...3Embed
