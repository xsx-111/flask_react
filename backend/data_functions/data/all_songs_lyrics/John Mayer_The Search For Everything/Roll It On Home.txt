Roll It On Home Lyrics
One last drink to drink wishful thinkin'
And then another again
The bar is getting brighter
And the walls are closin' in
Journey on the jukebox singin'
Don't let the believin' end
The one that you had eyes for
Had their eyes for your best friend

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

The last ten texts were with your ex
And all of 'em were sent by you
But you keep starin' at your phone like something's comin' through
Come to grips and take your chips when the cards aren't goin' your way
You've been here so long tonight's already yesterday
Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Drop a couple dollars, bum yourself a light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home
Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Roll it on home1Embed
