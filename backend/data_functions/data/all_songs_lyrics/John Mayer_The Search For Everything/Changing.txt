Changing Lyrics
I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing

I met me someone changing
We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder if she'll be the one
When I am done changing
Some of us stopped running
Some of us went home
Some of us don’t got one
So we'll build one of our own
Friends behind their fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I’m gonna come to my senses
But I'm still changing
And I can’t change my ways
I see the sky changing
Reminds me of my changing
Wish I could tie me a rope 'round the sun
'Cause I am not done changing
Time's been talking to me
Whispering in my ear
Saying “Follow your heart
'Til it tears you apart”
But hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing


I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing
Changing
