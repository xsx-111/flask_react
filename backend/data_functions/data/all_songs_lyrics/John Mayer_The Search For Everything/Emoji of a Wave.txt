Emoji of a Wave Lyrics
Oh, honey
You don't have to try so hard
To hurt me
Don't worry
I been thinking bout you too
What do we do

Your heart is where my head should be
The dissonance is killing me
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

Oh, honey
Oh, honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on

Oh, honey
I been talking to myself
Just to hear you
And you're saying
Everything I wish you would
And it's so good
It's raining on the mission bell
They're draining out the wishing well
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on

I rose in you like morning light
And sheltered you asleep at night
It breaks my heart
It takes all the love I have to say
I know we're gonna be okay
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

Oh, honey
Oh, honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave, and I know
That when it comes
I just hold on until it's gone6Embed
