Pretending LyricsForget the times
Weeks and days from long time ago
That is what the pictures are for
So that you can clear your mind from the past
Go chase a dream
Build it and do not set it free
Build it for the whole world to see
Know that there's a reason why: it's your heart
Know how to succeed
The problem is time
Better to say you want it all
Not willing to wait
'Cause we all have our due time
Pretty soon you're dead
You can't pretend, you can't deny, you can't deny
Pretty soon you're dead
You can't pretend, you can't deny, you can't deny
Pretty soon you're dead
You can't pretend, you can't deny, you can't deny
Pretty soon you're dead
You can't pretend, you can't deny, you can't deny
Forget the times
Weeks and days from long time ago
That is what the pictures are for
So that you can clear your mind from the past
Go chase a dream
Build it and do not set it free
Build it for the whole world to see
Know that there's a reason why, it's your heart
Know how to succeed
The problem is time
Better to say you want it all
Not willing to wait
'Cause we all have a due time (A due date)
Pretty soon you're dead
You can't pretend, you can't deny, you can't deny
Pretty soon you're dead
You can't pretend, you can't deny, you can't deny
Pretty soon you're dead
You can't pretend, you can't deny, you can't deny
Pretty soon you're dead
You can't pretend, you can't deny, you can't deny
You can't deny, you can't deny
You can't deny, you can't deny
You can't deny
You can't deny1Embed
