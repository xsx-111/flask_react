Milk LyricsSleep on this bed
Tossing and turning you'll never figure out a way
Harder to be free
When you look at me
Hoping to find me awake on this lonely bed
(Hopeful)
Sleep on this bed
Tossing and turning you'll never figure out a way
Harder to be free
When you look at me
Hoping to find me awake in this lonely bed
And it's true
You will drift away
And I won't mind
Yes, it's true
And I know (la, la, la, la, la)
You will drift away
Don't you drift away
Don't you drift away
No, I won't mind
Here's to a long life
You will drift away
And I won't mind
Here's to you, ooh
I know
You will drift away
And I won't mind
Yes, it's true
I know (la, la, la, la, la)
You will drift away
Don't you drift away
Don't you drift away
No, I won't mind
Here's to a long life
You will drift away
And I won't mind
Here's to you12Embed
