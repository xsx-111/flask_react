Things to Ponder While Falling LyricsHome, where I'll rest
From these wounds of coyness and shame
Home, where I'll be
And with ease you'll find me detained
From these wounds of coyness and circumstance
Here I belong
Home, where I'll rest
From these wounds of coyness and shame
Home, where I'll be
And from this throne I'll ponder into the night
Of the joy I once knew
Before the fall
On this throne you'll find me resigned from these
Wounds of coyness and circumstance
Wounds I call homeEmbed
