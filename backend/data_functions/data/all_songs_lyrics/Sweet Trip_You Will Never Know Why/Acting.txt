Acting LyricsDon't speak of golden dreams
You once had a chance to make things right
Gone are your friends in need when you broke their heart
So sad, so sad, so hopeless
Don't speak of golden dreams, there's no time
You know this time it's over
Ba, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da
(Acting on regrets, acting on regrets)
Ba-da, ba-da
(Acting on regrets)
Gone are your friends in need when you broke their heart
So sad, so sad, so hopeless
Don't speak of golden dreams, there's no time
(Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da)
You know this time it's over
(Baaaaa)
Ba, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da
(Acting on regrets, acting on regrets)
Ba-da, ba-da
(Acting on regrets)
Ba-da-da, da-da, ba-da-da, da-da, da
Ba-da-da, da-da, ba-da-da, da-da, da
Ba-da-da, da-da (ba-da-da), ba-da-da, da-da (ba-da-da), da
Ba-da-da, da-da (ba-da-da), ba-da-da, da-da (ba-da-da), da2Embed
