Darkness LyricsDarkness comes to murder the sunshine
Darkness comes to help me believe
That we'll never again be together
Love has turned to sand and debris
Sorry you have lost your way
I will not be here to stay, so long
Sorry you have lost your mind
Please don't me make me waste my life, so long
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Darkness comes to murder the sunshine
Darkness comes to help me believe
That we'll never again be together
Love has turned to sand and debris
I will never fall
I will never fall in love again
I will never fall (da-da-da, da-da-da)
I will never fall in love again
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da
(Da-da-da, da-da-da)
I will never fall (I will never fall)
I will never fall in love again
I will never fall (I will never fall)
I will never fall in love again
Da-da, da-da, da-da da-da-da
I will never fall (I will never fall)
I will never fall in love again
Don't you know that someone wants to be loved?
I will never fall (I will never fall)
I will never fall in love again
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da4Embed
