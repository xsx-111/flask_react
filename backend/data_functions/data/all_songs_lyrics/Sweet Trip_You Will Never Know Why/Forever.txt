Forever LyricsI'll wait, I'll wait
For you, it's never too late
Skies shelter your face
Then crown you the moon
Fool me, fool me
You're cold and severe as the rain
My eyes are forever doomed
To cry over you
You're forever cruel
Fool me, fool me
You're cold and severe as the rain
My eyes are forever doomed
To cry over you
You're forever cruel
This is so eternal
I've become nocturnal
Sleeping my days away
Oh, this is so eternal
Only forever
Only forever will tell
Oh, oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh5Embed
