To the Moon LyricsSystem of regret
Merely dearly departed juveniles
Get a clue
Twenty-seven ways to lie
And subtle ways to tell a lie
And twenty-seven women line up to the moon
And to the moon, to the moon, to the moon
Invitation fails
Panic tears our tormented juvenile
Who understood
Subtle ways to tell a lie
And many ways I had to practice
Only one female's alive
Only one female, the one that will never know
A way to smile
Subtle ways to tell a lie
And twenty-seven women line up to the moon
And to the moon, to the moon, to the moon
To the moon, to the moon, to the moon, to the moonEmbed
