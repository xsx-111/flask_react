Your World Is Eternally Complete LyricsBaby, it's time for you to face the weather
Open your eyes as long as you're together
Your heart, your mind, your arms, your hands
Your heart, your mind, your mind's invincible
Carry yourself through the frozen desert
Empty your thoughts into the well of pressure
You're all you need, you're all you have
Your heart, your mind, your mind a golden river
Beware of guise without smile
Afraid of light without charm
When all you wanted
Was for your world to be eternally complete
Baby, it's time for you to face the weather
Open your eyes as long as you're together
Your heart, your mind, your arms, your hands
Your heart, your mind, your mind's invincible
Carry yourself through the frozen desert
Empty your thoughts into the well of pressure
You're all you need, you're all you have
Your heart, your mind, your mind a golden river
Beware of guise without smile
Afraid of light without charm
When all you wanted
Was for your world to be eternally complete
Ba, ba-da-da, da, da-da-da, da
Ba, ba-da-da, da, da-da-da, da
Ba, ba-da-da, da, da-da-da, da
Ba, ba-da-da, da, da-da-da, da
