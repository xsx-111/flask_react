No Words to Be Found LyricsIf you begin to tell a story
Refrain from things that end in glory
The songs you sing are only sung
No words to me, no notes to be found
If long ago, our house was built
The ocean by, but fenced in guilt
The air inside that choked your lungs
Comfort forewarned us and I will go
No notes to be found
No notes to be found
No notes to be found
No notes to be found1Embed
