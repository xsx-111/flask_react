Song About a Sea LyricsHere to make another song, I see through me
Endless is the sea of the night
I'm here to tell the world, find the light I see through me
Think of it so brittle and bright
I'm here to tell the world, I can't get a lose me
Burn your several pages and fight
And though you don't know why tried and tried abuse me
Endless is the sea of the night
I'm here to tell the world that you're what's good for itEmbed
