Chlorine & Wine LyricsWhen I called on my nursemaid
Come sit by my side
But she cuts through my ribcage
And pushes the pills deep in my eyes
The taste was much sweeter
Than chlorine and wine
And my doctor's unable
To cut through the cable
That leads to my mind
In spite of the winter
There's ways to keep warm
Whatever you give me
Please know that I'll ask you for more
The day I stopped swimming
And came out of the tide
I'd never felt so uncomfortably numb
Here by your side
Black rose on the bed
Turn me to fire
Black rose in the vein
Shine in your eye
Please
Don't lay me down
Under the rocks where I found
My place in the ground
A home for the fathers and sons
Black rose on the bed
Turn me to fire
Black rose in the vein
Shine in your eye
Please
Don't lay me downEmbed
