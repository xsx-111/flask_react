Desperation Burns LyricsI hate to say, but we've looked on better days
It took me by surprise
We left our quiet home behind
The castaways drag the lake
The desperation burns
Raise the alarm
Un-close your eyes
Desperation
You never sang so sweetly 'til you whispered in my ear
I never heard a sound but I could hear
The hatchet-man dusting off his sleeve
Spil't my blood and drank my dreams
And stopped the spinning wheels
Wash away the bitter taste
The desperation burns
Raise the alarm
Un-close your eyes
Desperation
The last one flew
Just out of sight
If it throws you away
Just sit back and enjoy the ride
Raise the alarm
Un-close your eyes
Desperation burnsEmbed
