If I Have to Wake Up (Would You Stop the Rain?) LyricsKill the lights!
There's something wrong with today
This isn't me, this is on you
All I can say, all I can do is wait
Hold on
We are birds in your hand
Brace yourself
One in the air, ten in the sand
Clip my wings and let me fall to you
If I have to wake up
Would you stop the rain?
If I try to fly away
Open your arms
And wake up
Take a dive
Fill your lungs with summer rain
Pace yourself
Heavy the heart, steady the hand
One last taste of milk and gasoline
Too long
In a lunatic parade
Aces high
One of a kind, ten of a pair
Lifted up and crashing down on you
If I have to wake up
Would you stop the rain
If I try to fly away
Open your eyes
Wake up
Pull me to the ground
If I have to fall down
Let me fall to youEmbed
