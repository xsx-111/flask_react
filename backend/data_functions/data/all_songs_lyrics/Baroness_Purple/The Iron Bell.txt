The Iron Bell LyricsShow me the hill
Show me the gallows pole, the iron bell
Cry me a river
If I could I would leave today
Wake me when I'm dead
There's a thousand devils screaming in my head
Wake me when I'm gone
And I'll tell you when the right outweighs the wrong
That's all you get
I'm bored again
Bored again
Take me to hell
Show me the gatling-guns and the fireworks
Cry me a river
If I could I'd burn those tears away
Worn down to my bones
There's a thousand miles to go before I'm home
Push me to the edge
I bet you you'll wish you'd done it all along
That's all you get
I'm bored again
Bored again
That's all you get
I'm bored again
Bored again
Iron bell
Curtain call
Gallows pole
The curtain falls
That's all you getEmbed
