Kerosene LyricsClimbing up the walls again
A constant spinning wheel
Though I made the same mistake
My love is never enough
Spider-webs radiate
Pale electric blue
And I can feel the morning light
Crashing down on you
You'll take your time
I'll take mine
And I'll wait so...patiently
Drown my love in Kerosene
And in the final hour
Absence told my heart to wander away
Lost too long above the stars
Heard the tether snap
I got so high I'm satisfied
I'm never coming back
You'll take your time
I'll take mine
And I'll wait so...patiently
Drown my love in Kerosene
And in the final hour
Absence told my heart to wander away
When I am done I'll lay in the sun
And when I am done I'll lay in the sunEmbed
