Morningstar LyricsFar beyond horizons
There's a master in martyr's disguise
Pale as the Morningstar strung to the sky
Never mind the altars
Or the crooks in their saintly attire
All of us tinder-wood bound for the fire
Could you lay me down with my someone
To carry the weight
The damage I have done
Release the hounds my lady
Let 'em tear at the moon and the stars
Torment the heavens and laugh at the sky
Dry your tears my darling
There's a pistol-whipped look in your eyes
The captain was gentle, he left you alive
Could you lay me down with my someone
To carry the weight
The damage I have done
Could you lay me down with my someone
To carry the weight
The damage I have done2Embed
