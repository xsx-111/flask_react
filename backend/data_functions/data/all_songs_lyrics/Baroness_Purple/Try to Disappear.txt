Try to Disappear LyricsI will bury your bones inside my garden
Underneath your eyes can't burn through me anymore
I will throw a golden anchor in the harbor
Tie you by your chain to the ghost on the ocean floor
And as my lungs deflate
You help me suffocate
We have no need to breathe
You tried to disappear
So long
I followed you
Along the eastern banks I ran
'Til no more could I stride
No wing nor cloven hoof
Would let me stay rolling tide
Across the coastal banks she runs
And gallops towards the sea
But I cannot outrun the beast
That bears my sanity
And as my lungs deflate
You help me suffocate
We have no need to breathe
You tried to disappear
So long
I followed you
The world is great and wide
But wherever you go you know
I'm a step behind
Lay that hammer down
If your cross needs a nail I'm sure we can sort it out
If you try to disappear
I'm just around the bend
So long
I followed you
When you try to run and hide
It warms my little heart
So long
I followed youEmbed
