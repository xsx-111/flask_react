Wolf Pack Lyrics
And we're the three best friends that anybody could have
We're the three best friends that anyone can have
We're the three best friends that anyone can have
And we'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever leave each other

Tee-Wyla
Uhh
Aha
Fernie
Social
Uhh, I guess it just got real (yeah)
Father start tourin' some on mixtapes
They said God was boring, well just look at this face
Understand this is the plan, it's necessary
All that freedom and you end up in a cemetery
No hope just live it how ya wanna
I can dig it cause I did it but look at what I become and
This social thing of ours
Rules to this life for sure
Christ in the centre if you want to be a member
Half the summer you can keep it fire when it's winter time
First quarter we in headquarters, I got a business ma
I push the message of a risen God
And you know it's excellence
Since me and Marty's name involved
Album on the way, concerts being booked, souls getting saved
I guess we gettin' 'em to listen, hey
Still caddy riding heavy through my old 'hood
Covered by his blood, and forever claimin' his love

Mister Anthony Rose
And I rep that Misfit Gang
Sheep dressed in wolf's clothes
And if you ask me we the rest mayne
Not because of fashion bro
It's all because it's passing over
I'mma change this world one soul at a time and you can go ahead and ask my pastor though (ask my pastor though)
Holy Ghost writer with the master flow
I'mma face off Casta Troy
Let me switch it back from fast to slow
I was Damon Wayans
I had major pain
But He came to levitate me like I was David Blaine
Up, up in the sky now
In the game with no time out
Every time that I rhyme now
I promise I don't try now
I was chosen there was no try out
The coach he put me right up in it
The other side is screamin' (hold up, wait a minute)
I'm air born, HD
I'll never get in my Seida
I'm air born, AI
Thirty thousand feet up
A. Rose, learn the name
So you don't need to see ID
Heart Official, that Good City
Social Club, BRB

Okay, Social Club Misfit Gang
Known for killin' everything
People act like we have all the answers, I don't know a thing
Jesus Christ is in my heart and I don't own a chain
But I light my city up, I'm feelin' like a Power Ranger
Flyer than an Angel
You can't say I'm stranger
Than these other guys, I get it from my mothers side
Livin' in my other life
I killed myself the other night
And I'm dying to my flesh, it's do or die
Group up big with that Wu Tang, Good City my crew
Gettin' it no loose change
Record labels can't use me
So I know this and I know that
Grew up bad, had no friends so I know what it is to be alone
So I'mma call this song my
