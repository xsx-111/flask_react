Chocolate Bobka LyricsLet's have some fun huh
Okay, Yeah
And all I have left are these broken dreams
I heard "I love you" so much I don't know what it means
I used to be a screw up when I was 16
Walking through my highschool halls, nobody notice me
Uh, and now I'm killing it, we killing it
Social Club, Misfit Gang, the whole team is ridiculous
Don't try to jump the Bang wagon
You ain't catching up
Plus we really love the Lord, that's where the difference is
So don't confuse me with them other guys
Just wanna give glory to the one who saved my life
If you could see the old me it's like day and night
Not too bad for the suicidal kid, who hates his life
Yeah! Uh!
Marty Mar, I'm just a misfit
Trouble maker, by my nature I see things so different
Friends start to pick it up, and now they acting distant
Die for my city, Suicidal Kids we livin'
It's the Social Club, Misfit Gang
(Argh!!) ×8
Since a young age I had mojo with the flow so
Whenever I spend my focus, it propel me to more than local
This life we chose to live, this road we walk on, where we livin'
Is for the taking, why we here?
So don't be scared 'cause we forgiven
Social Club, Misfit Gang, Wolf Pack, informally
Cause we about to eat like we gots??
It's no problem, lay the track down, I promise
There are stages in the church down brother, God's honest
Spoke the torrents to existence as rain was some blessing from above
All love till the day I go
And yo!
And this here is just a preview for my next trip
Lemme see, I don't see
(I don't)
See nobody, God is my lone bodyguard
When the thief robs, just know that the Lord's got me
(Better know)
You copy? Fernie He spits ¿¿shaddies??
Force of a double barrel and hope that you see GawviEmbed
