Venetian Blinds Lyrics
I want to be somebody to believe in
And things I took for granted I'm not leavin'
They don't understand the movement that we leadin'
So people hate us and don't even have a reason
I've got my own problems I'm not sleepin'
And every girl I dated always tries to get even
Tries to get me back because I know that I hurt 'em
I always let 'em do it cause I know I deserve it
I broke your halo, I know I'm not perfect
I want to stay together like we're cursive
But we fighting everything we surface
She might stay together for the purses
I'm writing words do I have a purpose
And I give you my life although it's worthless
And do something with me but I'm nervous
And these are my thoughts behind the curtain

Behind the curtain where you can't see
Pull it back, who's that, say it ain't me (No way)
It can't be, where's my mothers son
And we crash because you don't know where we comin' from
Behind the curtain where it's plain to see
Me broken down, hard for me to hold it down (What?)
I thank God for serenity
Beats tranquility
Free from captivity
You don't laugh when I say I'm focused on my career
Hoping that new make-up I buy you can soak up all your tears
For now here's some money and a Bible on a dresser with a gun next to it in case you got to send a message (send a message)
I'm on a road and you alone and I heard about a killin'
We hard of hearin' from the Lord, my ear's to the ceilin'
My 9 to 5 killin' me
Runnin' villains in the night when my mind runs in
And is filled up with adrenaline
Had a few
I'm in and out of school
Half awake, my boss in and say I'm bending all the rules
My wife looked in my bloodshot eyes and didn't see us
Th-th-that's when the room got quiet like a Prius (why)
To the me when I got wrong
When I spend my time writin' songs
I don't blame you if you want to leave it all
You cheaters, goldfish up against piranhas
I ain't perfect, I just do wanna deliver broken promises

Behind the curtain where you can't see
Pull it back, who's that, say it ain't me (No way)
It can't be, where's my mothers son
And we crash because you don't know where we comin' from
Behind the curtain where it's plain to see
Me broken down, hard for me to hold it down (What?)
I thank God for serenity
Beats tranquility
Free from captivity
Young brother on the block trynna make it pot
We on the strip, trynna make it flip
My DNA said otherwise
Blood bars, don't confuse us with the other side
You can say I'm a wretch, but amazing grace
When I meet Him, get to see my Lord face-to-face (What else)
I'ma break down thinkin' 'bout the cold nights
Overdose status but you never let your boy die
Personal things I leave on this track forever
Using this here as medicine, I feel better
Let's get one thing clear I can't save you
But the King I speak of and to is a savior (Yes)
I make Daniel like Xavier
Been in the den but my God had me raised up
Huh, and to you I live crazy
Until you come take it
Social Club major
Fern

Behind the curtain where you can't see
Pull it back, who's that, say it ain't me (No way)
It can't be, where's my mothers son
And we crash because you don't know where we comin' from
Behind the curtain where it's plain to see
Me broken down, hard for me to hold it down (What?)
I thank God for serenity
Beats tranquility
Free from captivity1Embed
