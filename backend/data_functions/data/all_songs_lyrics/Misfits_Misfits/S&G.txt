S&G Lyrics
(Social Club is the best)
Social Club
Yeah
Listen

I relate to kids when they feel left out
I'm sitting all alone, feeling empty in this house
And I think about the nights I spent all by myself
Got too much pride to ever ask you for help
I told my mom whatever she needs she can have it
One of three couples I know with a good marriage
My friend and his wife don't even share a mattress
This can't happen to us baby, it's tragic
I miss when we were all a big family
Get togethers tell me if you even still think of me
My uncle and I haven't spoken in a second
And I blame him for the bad relationship with my cousin
I lost a pastor, my aunt lost a husband
Feeling is mutual because I don't even trust him
And now I put my trust in the God who first loved me
Misfit in my blood everybody's normal but me

Mmmmmh, what is this
Feeling that I'm feeling when I look at this misfit in the mirror
I feel like I missed it
And it feels like a lie. Now I feel like I'm Lot
And this is Sodom and Gomorrah, mora, mora, mora, mora
And this is Sodom and Gomorrah, mora, mora, mora, mora
I went from liquor and pornography
To writing jewels about the God in me
I was a fool even I could see
So why the Lord keep his eye on me
I seen an old friend from around the way
Ay, He said Fern, bruh you on your way
Say, I know you from them late nights
Cray, on that get right
Hey, and now you make my day
He said he never stop believing that my words would reach the children
Because the way I come across I make them feel like that I'm forgiven
Said the way I come across I make them feel like that I'm forgiven
If your bitter give the grudge up
Short time span, you're better off showing love bruh
Lifestyle did a 180
We need God greatly would I (?) my baby
