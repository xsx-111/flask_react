STRT TRBL Lyrics
Yeah
Yo, if the ceiling's not like 30 or 40 feet I get claustrophobic

Social Club Misfit Gang Wolf Pack Renegades
She said that I'm screwed up, I said "I'm born this way"
Had thoughts about hanging myself
It's all about me and nobody else
I told my mom that I'm afraid of myself
I'm trusting in God and nobody else
Sitting alone when I'm all by myself
Bullied in school, I know it felt
Say hello to the bad guy himself
Social Club, we're running the world
Welcome to the beginning
Jumping into the crowd, I'm on top of this building
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, what is this feeling
I'm unstoppable because you can't stop what the Lord is building
Social
Stupid

Tilt your head, act like it's all insane
Telling stages in the church, they all know the name
Five fingers on that Word, brother, God's honours
I promise we living to live in God's corner
Tilt your head, act like it's all insane (social)
Telling stages in the church, they all know the name
Five fingers on that Word, brother, God's honours
I promise we living to live in God's corner

Once upon a time in a different life I was living foul bruh
But I found Him
That was all I needed
Parents brought me up good, but I still retreated

Sometimes I wonder if I never left and stayed the walk at some point in time I know a lot of things would be different
We be that bridge over troubled water
A conversation piece if you will, for those who wouldn't listen brother
I've seen people come to Christ after Social concerts
MartyMar's a pastor so I'm always undercoverin'
We about to smash these to a daze though, all day flow
That since we out here vibing in Barbados, we don't play though
If nothing but excellence what I speak about
Christ and the life, me and wifey we 

Tilt your head, act like it's all insane
Telling stages in the church, they all know the name
Five fingers on that Word, brother, God's honours
I promise we living to live in God's corner
Tilt your head, act like it's all insane (social)
Telling stages in the church, they all know the name
Five fingers on that Word, brother, God's honours
I promise we living to live in God's cornerEmbed
