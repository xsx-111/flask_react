Screwed Up Kids Lyrics
Social Club
Uh, run with us or get ran over
Misfit Gang in some army green like I'm a soldier
We don't want your freebies or a feature don't you see the team
Sorry for the  face buddy, I'm not really mean
But this is pure talent
And a lot of grind top it off with God's blessing
Hear it in the rhyme
Focus and the team strong (killin')
See it in the eyes
Stylin' on everything until the day they realize

Oh, the way I hate myself, it's disgusting
Smile at everything but get mad over nothing
Fights with the lady I tell the world that I'm loving
Like Christ loved the Church instead I hurt, I'm fumbling
Asleep at the wheel, veering in the wrong lane
I hate when I crash and the pain it gets ugly
Trust me, I hate this play
But when I see it through Christ I see a beautiful life

Uh, I thank God for the gift of grace
To bless my life full flip when I change my ways
From a dark place
To the throne room
I lay sitting just amazed what the Lord do
I'm going press towards the goal trust
Lord knows I vow 'til it's orderly, He send His own Son
Tell a block we're come in peace, it's all love
And His name I praise 'til we're all gone
Good City Music on the map and we might be the last
Put us ahead of the class
Not featherweights made of glass
 like an iron ore, won't catch us with the mask
We murder beats like so unique this treasure's never trash
Contemplated
Elevated
For the world we can never trade it
It's all for one and beautiful the way we made it, made it
For the glory of the One
Who wrote His story on our hearts
We stick together 
And this is how the movement starts

My momma told me that I would soar like an eagle (uh huh)
Others tried to tell me different but I ain't really seem safe
Cause I ain't need 'em like a needle in a haystack
Hard to find but He found me and I ain't never escaped that
For granted, granted I'm a man with some baggage
But He managed to grab a hold of this man that was average
And now I'm living that good life
Told the world good night
And I'm living when I'm dreaming, homie this is what it looks like

To think back recap life in a nutshell
Great childhood still ended in a stuffed cell (aha)
Mam and Pap perfect examples in hindsight (they were)
 supposedly getting my mind right
Uh, everything got so screwed up (it did)
But I'm back and I'm feeling so brand new bruh
Social Club foster home for the runaways
Running for your , I'm praying you may get home again
Fernie

My family liked me before I rapped (before I rapped)
Tellin' them I swear I'm coming back (coming back)
That competition has never been a match
And we're killing everything I should be dressing all black
Running from my future but I never told my past
And I think about the friendships that I never thought would last
Screwed up kids yeah we got a lot of problems
Never thought we would make it but we made it from the bottom like
