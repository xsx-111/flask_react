Roller Coaster Lyrics
I treat her like I never had a girl
So when we go on dates I love her like I've not been hurt
And she supports Social Club and loves me at my worst
Sometimes I feel like I'm screwed up and shouldn't be with her
But I'm in love with her
And she's in love with me
And honestly I'm waiting for the day she's had enough of me
I got a lot of trust issues but they're underneath
People say they understand, they don't honestly
Cause people tell me that they love me then they hate me
There's no in between this is how the past made me
Made me to be a monster and I know I am
But I'm saved for the grace I don't understand
How could a loving God die for a sinner
I start to feel loneliness right around the winter
We exchanged numbers the first time that I met her
And I called her later night to tell her I can't forget her
Now she's gone

No tears for the one who got away (no, no more tears, oh)
I know that the Lords got somebody better on the way
Somebody better on the way (somebody better on the way), somebody better on the way
No tears for the one who got away (no, no more tears, oh)
I know that the Lords got somebody better on the way
Somebody better on the way (somebody better on the way), somebody better on the way
It's funny how you think you know what love is
At sixteen and seventeen you ending up lovesick
The first time I met him, he had me mesmerized
It was like something out of a movie
And we reciting lines
He promised me forever, he gave me all his time
And I was hungry for attention so I ate up all his lines
This feeling that I'm feeling got me feeling so good
And I can't walk away even though I know I should
Playing games now tugging at each others hearts
He say one thing I say another, but I was broken from the start
I'm insecure in all my ways
I kept him in the dark
I can tell he wants to love me but I ain't trying to break his heart
And this is real life how do I explain it
He's always on my mind but I slowly see him fading
And now my body's aching
It's hard for me to breathe
The thought of me without him is something I can't conceive

No tears for the one who got away (no, no more tears, oh)
I know that the Lords got somebody better on the way
Somebody better on the way (somebody better on the way), somebody better on the way
No tears for the one who got away (no, no more tears, oh)
I know that the Lords got somebody better on the way
Somebody better on the way (somebody better on the way), somebody better on the wayEmbed
