Hard as a Rock Lyrics
A rolling rock, electric shocks
She gives a lickin' that don't stop
She light 'em up, push you 'round
Smokin' rings goin' 'round and 'round

Her hot potatoes
Will elevate you
Her bad behavior
Will leave you standin' proud
An' hard as a rock

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock

The lightnin' rod strike it hot
It's gonna hit you like the Rushmore rock
No nicotine and no pipe dreams
So low and dirty, it's down right mean

Hell elevator
Yeah, I'll see you later
No, I ain't going to take it
Yes, I'm
I'm busting out
I'm hard as a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock

Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yeah
I'm gettin' harder

Harder than a rock

Well, I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Babe, I'm harder than a rock, yeah

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock4Embed
