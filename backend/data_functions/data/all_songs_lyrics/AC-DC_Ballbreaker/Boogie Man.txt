Boogie Man Lyrics
Some people say I'm only out at night
Maybe those folks might've got it right
And some people say I drive a Cadillac car
Or sell my wares haunting hotel bars

I'm the boogie man
Yeah
The boogie man
Yeah, yeah-yeah

I like fine suits, smoke the best cigars
Like talking sex to women, girls, in fast cars
I might be under the bed, ready to bite
So, little girl, be careful when you're on your own, tonight
'Cause I'm your boogie man
Your boogie man

And I hope that you don't misunderstand
Your boogie man

I'm your boogie man
I'm the boogie man
Yes, I'm the boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Ow, here we go

And I hope that you don't misunderstand
Your boogie man
And don't let the sun come up on me
Your boogie man

I'm your boogie man, the boogie man
I'm your boogie man, the boogie man
I'm your boogie man, boogie man
Boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Yeah-yeah
I'm your boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Boogie manEmbed
