Caught with Your Pants Down Lyrics
Runnin' 'round with the wrong crowd
Goin' out on a last stand
Playin' too hard an' too loud
Bad cards in a bad hand
Wanna dance, wanna sing
Whip you with that lickin' thing

Tonight, I'm gonna kick up
Out drivin' in a big truck
An' maybe I'll get beat up
Caught with your pants down

Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down

Lining up for a roll call
Goin' out with a big bang
Gettin' caught in a shootout
Take it hard like a big man
Women workin' so hot
Givin' it everything you got
Just like it's never gonna stop
Ooh, tonight, I'm gonna kick up
Out drivin' in a big truck
An' maybe I'll get beat up
Caught with your pants down

Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down

Yeah, yeah, yeah
She take 'em down, down, down
Though she rip off her stockings when the place start rockin'
(Down, down, down)
She was a woman with a mission, stick it in your face

Caught with your pants down
Down, down, down, down, down

Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Beggin' with your pants down
Got you with your pants down
I'm humping with my pants down
Caught you with you pants down
Everybody talking 'bout you (pants down)
Sneakin' in the alley with your (pants down)
Breakin' in her room to get your (pants down)Embed
