Do the Standing Still Lyrics
Oh whoa-oh, well the Pony was funky
The Watusi was kinda smooth
Oh whoa-oh, well the problem with all
Those little dance steps was you had to move
Oh whoa-oh, well they found a brand-new step
And it doesn't take anything to get this groove, uh-huh!

And they're doing the standing still
And they're doing the standing still
And they're doing the standing still
And they're doing the standing still, hey!

Oh whoa-oh, well it's a sensation
Across the entire nation
Oh whoa-oh, a hundred million kids
All dancing in suspended animation
Oh whoa-oh, and the feeling's all right
We'll be standing still until the morning light, yeah!

And they're doing the standing still
And they're doing the standing still
And they're doing the standing still
And they're doing the standing still, hey!
I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed
Oh, my aching head
Uh-huh!

In Fargo, six or seven kids
Watched the Plan in a strip-mall
Well, I thought they were bored out of their skulls
But it turns out they were having a ball, uh-huh
Oh whoa-oh, well I finally knew
They were doing a brand new step that everybody isn't moving to

And they're doing the standing still
And they're doing the standing still
And they're doing the standing still
And they're doing the standing still, yeah!1Embed
