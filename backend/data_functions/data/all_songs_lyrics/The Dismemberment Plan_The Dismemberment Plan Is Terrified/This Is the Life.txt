This Is the Life Lyrics
And when they tell you that you don't know what you're doing now
And when they tell you that you're not the one to live your life
And when they tell you that they think that you're just marking time
And when they tell you that they think that you're in trouble now
And when they tell you that you're wasting the best years of your life
And when they tell you that you'll never get a single thing right
Well, put up a fight

But this is the life
No matter what they say, you know that
This is the life
For better or worse, it'll stay that way

And when they tell you that they think they've got you figured out
And when they tell you that they think they know what makes you tick
And when they step with their 12-point program for being like them
And when they tell you that you're blowing every chance you get
And when they tell you that you're setting up a life of regret
And when they tell you that you just can't get a single thing straight
Well, it's too late

'Cause this is the life
No matter what they say, you know that
This is the life
No matter what they do, you know that
This is the life
For better or worse, we'll see it through
And when they gather 'round like a coven of witches with their sneering pity
Tell them sons of bitches
Tell them sons of bitches
Tell them sons of bitches

And this is the life
And this is the lifeEmbed
