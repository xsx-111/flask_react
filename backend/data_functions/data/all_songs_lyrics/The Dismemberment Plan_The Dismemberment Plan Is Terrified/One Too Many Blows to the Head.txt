One Too Many Blows to the Head Lyrics
I don't want to get back into the ring
But I feel like these gloves are glued to my knuckles
And every time, and every time I try to stand up for myself
Yeah, yeah
I start to feel, I feel my knees start to buckle, buckle, yeah
Yeah!

One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on

And as I step into the, step into the, step into the, step into the, step into the, step, step, step into the ring
I see my opponent, he is 10 feet tall and 500 pounds, yeah
This is getting kind of frightening
As we knock gloves, and as we knock gloves, and as we knock gloves, and as we knock gloves, he said
"Don't you think your moves could use a little lightning?"
That's when he turned to me and said, and I quote: "Boy
Use a little less whitening, whitening, yeah!"

One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
Yeah, a da-dat, a da-dat, a da-dat, a da-dat, a dat-dat-dat-dat, waaaa, huhh, uh!
'Cause I've got everything I want but I'm losing my mind
Yeah! Hey! L-l-l-la, l-l-l-la, l-l-l-la-la-la-la
Body blow, body blow...
Knock him out
Dut-dut-dut, dut-dut-dut, dut-dut-dut, dut-dut-dut, dut-dut-dut, dut-dut-dut, yeah!

One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
One too many blows to the head, yeah
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
One too many, one-one too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight onEmbed
