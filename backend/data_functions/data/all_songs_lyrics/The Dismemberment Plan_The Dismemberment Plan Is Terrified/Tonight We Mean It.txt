Tonight We Mean It Lyrics
Head to toe rayon, don't light a match
We were good and we're starting from scratch
Going to a place that never existed
And probably never will, yeah
Oh, a blue light basement on a throw-down autonomous zone
Where we dim the lights and leave well enough alone
Leave your context at home and leave your irony at the door
Tonight we'll even the score

Well, tonight we mean it
When we dance
Well, tonight we mean it
When we cry
Well, tonight we mean it
When we laugh
Well, tonight, tonight, yeah

I know everybody here would love to get down and to wipe the slate clean
And do what they want and say what they mean
And eliminate the existential quandaries of modern, postmodern reality, ya dig?
No issues, no motives, no problems, no questions
Just sexy people and purity of intention
Sounds so good, I can barely bring myself to mention
It's my sad, sad invention
Well, tonight we mean it
When we dance
Well, tonight we mean it
When we cry
Well, tonight we mean it
When we laugh
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

I lost my invitation and I don't know where I'm going
I might just drive around and try to listen for something weird
Yeah, you're welcome to come along

Well, tonight we mean it
When we dance
Well, tonight we mean it
When we laugh
Well, tonight we mean it
When we cry
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonightEmbed
