Academy Award Lyrics
Playing for the bleachers now
Letting them beat you and showing them how
Dangling yourself from the cross
All out of nails, but here's your hammer, boss

And the Academy Award for ridiculous over-acting goes to you
So get on up there and give us a speech

Taking all the attention away
After your performance, there's no one left to nominate
Dangling yourself from the cross
All out of nails, but, uh, here's your hammer, boss

And the Academy Award for embarrassing melodrama goes to you
So get on up there and give us a speech

Don't forget the little people
Who never were around
And the bigger ones who kept you down
Always knew you could do it
We always knew you could do it
(Jason Caddell!)
Don't forget the little people
Who never were around
And the bigger ones who let you down
Always knew you could do it
We always knew you could do it
We always knew you could do it
You couldn't do it without us
We always knew you could do itEmbed
