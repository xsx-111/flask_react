Bra Lyrics
So, goin' down the Amazon in a red brick boat, uh
Lookin' for some secret treasure, hot with malaria
And I've got that map upside-down
Well, north, south, east, west, "X" still marks that spot
And I'm so tired; and if I fell asleep, I might not ever wake up
Oh, yeah

So, goin' down the Amazon in a light pink push-up bra, yeah
You won't believe what I just saw:
A fully amazing time, and I've got that map upside-down
Well, north, south, east, west, "X" still marks that spot
And I feel like Young MC; and if I fell asleep, I might not ever wake up
Oh, god

A! E! I! O! You! And sometimes Y
A! E! I! O! You! And sometimes Y
Why? Because people don't like you!

So, goin' down the Amazon in a light green '57 Chevy, uh
Well, you think that's, um, kind of heavy?
You should read my poetry
And I've been known to read it out loudEmbed
