Manipulate Me Lyrics
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Oh, don't you know, life is a fantasy dress ball
And if you must come as yourself, well, you're no fun at all
Here's a tip: Just be yourself but more so
And that's our cue to go
Whoa-oh whoa-oh yeah

Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon

So, yes or no, are you in or are you out?
I didn't get all dressed up just to fight your self-doubt
Fool yourself and you can fool anyone you choose
There's no way you can lose
Whoa-oh whoa-oh yeah

Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
What's a line if you don't toe it?
What's the lead if you don't blow it?
I think losing everything could be so therapeutic
What's a horn if you don't toot it?
What's a gun if you don't shoot it?
Just because you fucked it up doesn't mean we knew it, yeah!

Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Manipulate me, oh yeah, c'mon
Hey!Embed
