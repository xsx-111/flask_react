Ziggy Stardust Lyrics
Oh yeah

Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could kill 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man,
Well hung, snow white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our bones?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was The Nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Oh yeah
Ooh
