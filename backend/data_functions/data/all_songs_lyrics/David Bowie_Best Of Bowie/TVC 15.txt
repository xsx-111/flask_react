TVC 15 Lyrics
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh

Up every evening 'bout half eight or nine
I give my complete attention to a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a, he's got more channels, a

So hologramic, oh, my TVC 15

I brought my baby home, she, she sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC 15, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, my, my, she crawled right in my

So hologramic, oh, my TVC 15
Oh, so demonic, oh, my TVC 15

Maybe if I pray every each night I sit there pleading
"Send back my dream test baby, she's my main feature"
My TVC 15, yeah, he just stares back unblinking
So hologramic, oh, my TVC 15

One of these nights I may just jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then we'll spend some time together

So hologramic oh my TVC 15

My baby's in there someplace, love's rating in the sky

So hologramic, oh, my TVC 15
