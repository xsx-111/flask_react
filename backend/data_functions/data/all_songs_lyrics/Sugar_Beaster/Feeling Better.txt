Feeling Better LyricsYou can walk away
But you can't forget what was said
And I can run away
Pull the covers over my head
Try to get away but I fall back again
I get up off the floor I'm coming back for more
(You need it/ You get some hate
You found it/ But it's too late)
Try to wear a smile and brush it all aside
I'm starting over now I'll try to sort it out somehow
(Hope you're feeling better
I'm not bitter yet/ You're fading through the years)
I guess that I should stay
Stay around like I always do
'cause if I ran away
There's no place I'd be going to
More than anything I want to work it out
It's never easy when you're falling down again
(You need it/ You get some hate
You found it/ But it's too late)
I keep breaking down it's more than I can take
You pull me off the floor I'm coming back for more
(Hope you're feeling better/ I'm not bitter yet/
You're fading through the years)
Where in the hell do you think you are
And who ever thought you'd get this far
And was the travel worth the time
It's time to open up your mind
I choose to give the gift of sight
The right to choose to give a life
The right to die the right to teach
To think you're right but not to preach
I've often wondered where you've been
Could someone go through this again
Another journey down that road
Prepared to bear a heavy load
I gave you everything I could
I gave you everything I had
There's nothing left for me to say
I guess it's time to walk awayEmbed
