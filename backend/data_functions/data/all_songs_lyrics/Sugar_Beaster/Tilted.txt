Tilted LyricsI only do these things to freak you out
I never wanted you to doubt me
I believe you/ Do I believe you
I try to block you out to hear myself
I can't believe I'm thinking to myself
Would I leave you/ In such suspense
I let it go and go and go
But what you're thinking through the silence
I really wish you understood
A couple of words get so much mileage
I never felt an urge to say a word
I'd rather listen to the din of
Other people closing in one me/ I lay in bed
And think of words that you should hear
I fall asleep and then they disappear
A fall from grace/ From memory
I hear a voice inside the silence
Speak your peace and all's forgotten
I hear the static on the line
Remember how this all got started
Remember/ Remember/ It's tilted
I turn away a minute disappears
I turn away in shame when I don't hear
What you're thinking/ Tell me what you're thinking
You take it out on me
You're not flaking out on me, are you
Turn it tilted/ Hey wait a minute
I never wanted you to be upset
But I can see you're trying to forget
What was said/ What was said
Don't try to hang me up again
Don't try to hang up on me wait up
Turn it tilted/ I need help it's
Remember/ Remember/ It's tiltedEmbed
