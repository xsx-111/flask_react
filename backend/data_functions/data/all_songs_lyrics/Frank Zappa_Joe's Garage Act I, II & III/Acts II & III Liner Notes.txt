Acts II & III Liner Notes LyricsEventually it was discovered
That God
Did not want us to be
All the same
This was
BAD NEWS
For the Governments of The World
As it seemed contrary
To the doctrine of
Portion Controlled Servings
Mankind must be made more uniformly
If
THE FUTURE
Was going to work
Various ways were sought
To bind us all together
But, alas
SAMENESS was unenforceable
It was about this time that someone
Came up with the idea of
TOTAL CRIMINALIZATION
Based on the principle that if we were ALL crooks
We could at last be uniform to some degree in the eyes of
THE LAW
Shrewdly our legislators calculated
That most people were too lazy to perform a
REAL CRIME
So new laws were
Manufactured
Making it possible for anyone to violate them
Any time of the day or night
And
Once we had all broken some kind of law
We'd all be in the same big happy club
Right up there with the President
The most exalted industrialists
And the clerical big shots
Of all your favorite religions
TOTAL CRIMINALIZATION
Was the greatest idea of its time
And was vastly popular
Except with those people
Who didn't want to be crooks or outlaws
So, of course, they had to be
TRICKED INTO IT...
Which is one of the reasons why
MUSIC
Was eventually made
ILLEGALEmbed
