Keep It Greasey Lyrics
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Roll it over 'n grease it down
I'll drive you through the heart of town
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Roll it over 'n grease it down
I'll drive you through the heart of town

Hey, the good women, they sure has it tough
The good men, well there ain't enough
All the good girls are lookin' all the time
Good men is something that they can't find
Cause if they find one miraculously
They try to be lovin' as they can be
If they find one and let him go
Chances are they might not never find one no mo'

Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Roll it over 'n grease it down
I'll drive you through the heart of town
A good lovin' man is hardest to find
A good woman needs to ease her mind
And I know a few that need to ease it behind
All y'gotta do is grease it down
'N everything is fine

Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Roll it over 'n grease it down
I'll drive you through the heart of town

A girl don't need no fancy grease
To get herself some rump release
Any kind of lube'll do
Maybe from another part of you
Lube from the North
Lube from the South
Take a little slobber
From the side of your mouth
From your mouth, from your mouth
From your mouth, from your mouth
Roll it over
Grease it down
Here come that crazy
Screamin' sound
AAAAAA!!! Oh no!!!
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Keep it greasy so it'll go down easy
Roll it over 'n grease it down (Down)
Down (Dow-hown)
Down (Dow-how-hown)
Grease it down
Oh no! Here comes that screamin' sound again!
