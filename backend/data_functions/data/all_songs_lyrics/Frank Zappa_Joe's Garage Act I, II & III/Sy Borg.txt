Sy Borg Lyrics
Sy Borg, gimme dat, gimme dat
Sy Borg, gimme dat
Give me the chromium leg
I beg, Sy Borg, gimme dat, gimme dat
Sy Borg, gimme dat
Give me the chromium leg
Little wires, pliers, tires
They turn me on
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm crazy, mon

Stroking several of SY's gleaming appendages, JOE continues

Gee, Sy
This is a real groovy apartment
You've got here
All government sponsored recreational services
Are clean and efficient
This is exciting
I never plooked
A tiny chrome-plated machine
That looks like a magical pig
With marital aids stuck all over it
Such as yourself before
You'll love it!
It's a way of life
Does that mean maybe later you'll plook me?
If you wish, we may have a groovy orgy
Just me and you?
I share this apartment
With a modified
Gay Bob doll
He goes all the way
Ever try oral sex with a miniature rubberized homo-replica?
No, ah, not yet
Ah, is this him?
This is him
Your wish is his command
He likes you
He wants to kiss you always
Just tell him what you want
Really?
Hi, little guy
Think I might get a tiny, but exciting
Blowjob, gimme dat, gimme dat
Blowjob, gimme dat
Give me de chromium cob
Bend over
Gay Bob, blowjob, gimme dat, gimme dat
Blow job, gimme dat
Give me de chromium cob
You'll love it!
It looks just like a TeleFunken U-47
Little leather cap and trousers
They look so gay
Warren just bought some, Warren just bought some
Warren just bought some, hey

Bob is tired
Plook me now
You savage rascal
Ehhh! That tickles
You are a fun person
I like you
I want to kiss you always
Gee, this is great
How's about some bondage and humiliation?
Anything you say, master
Oh no, I don't believe it
You're way more fun than Mary!
You're plooking too hard
And cleaner than Lucille
Plooking on me
What have I been missing
All these years?
Too hard
Sy
Too hard
Sy
Plooking too hard on me-e-e-e-e
Speak to me! Oh no
The golden shower must have shorted out his master circuit!
He's, he's, oh my God
I must have plooked him, hey
To death, hey
This is the Central Scrutinizer!
You have just destroyed one model
XQJ-37 Nuclear Powered Pan-Sexual Roto-Plooker
And you're gonna have to pay for it!
So give up, you haven't got a chance!
But I!
I, I, I, I, I!
I can't pay!
I gave all my money
To some kinda groovy religious guy two songs ago
Come on out, son
Between the two of us, we'll find a way to work it outEmbed
