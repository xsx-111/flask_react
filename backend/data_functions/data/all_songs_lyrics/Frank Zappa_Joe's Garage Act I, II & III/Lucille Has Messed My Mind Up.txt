Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up Lyrics
JOE is so disoriented by his disease, he goes in the other room and plays the title cut from an old Jeff Simmons album, and sings along with it

Lucille
Has messed my mind up
But I still love her
Oh I still love her
Lucille
Has messed my mind up
But I still need her
You know I need her

Whatcha tryna do to me
Lucille?
Whatcha tryna do to me
Lucille?
Whatcha tryna do to me
Lucille?
You got me goin' outta my mind

Lucille
Has tore my heart up
But I still love her
I really love her
Lucille
Has tore my heart up
But I still need her
You know I need her
She treats me like my heart
Is made of stone
She runs around
And leaves me home, all alone
She doesn't answer
When I call her on the phone
She messed up my mind
I'm cryin' all'a the time

Lucille
Has messed my mind up
But I still love her
I really love her
Lucille
Has tore my heart up
But I still need her
I really need her
Lucille
My mind up
I love her
I really love her
Lucille
My heart up
But I still love her
I really love her
Lucille
My mind up
I love her
I really love her
Lucille
My heart up
I really need her
I really really need her
Lucille
My mind up
I really love her
I really really love her
Lucille
My heart up
I really love her
I really love her
Lucille
My mind up
But I still love her
I really really love her
Lucille
My mind up
I really need her
I really really need her
Lucille
Has tore my heart up
I really love her
I really really love her
Lucille
My mind up
I really love her
I really love her1Embed
