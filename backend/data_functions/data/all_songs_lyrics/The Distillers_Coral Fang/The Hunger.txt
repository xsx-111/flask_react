The Hunger Lyrics
Holy eyes
I never knew I'd beg down at your feet
Hold on tight
I never knew I'd know much more than this
Open sky
The wave of pain, the scent of you is bliss
Hungry eyes
They stare at me, I know, I know, don't go!

Summertime
The taste of saint secretes of perfume mist
Console the mind
I take it in, the lips of pink, I kiss
Lonely sky
The more you take, the more that I give in
Holy eyes
I never knew, I know, I know, don't go!

Hold on to the memory
Yeah, it's all you got
I know you'll be there
To soak up blood lost
Blood lost, blood lost
Don't go!

Hold on to the memory
Yeah, it's all you got
I know you'll be there
To soak up blood lost
Hold on to the memory
Yeah, it's all you got
I know you'll be there
To soak up blood lost
Blood lost, blood lost

Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, huh
Ooh-ah, ooh, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh
Ooh, hey, it's true, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, I miss youEmbed
