Hall of Mirrors Lyrics
I come down like a hurricane sucked
Up inside, now I spit out the suffer, oh yeah
You said you want a revelation
Revel in this, my lover
You're free, at liberty
Is this what you want? Sometimes, I wonder

There's a highway to, to the edge, yeah
Once a night, you will drive yourself there
At the end of the road, you will find the answer
At the end of the road, you will drink your fear

I come down like a bloody rain cuts
Up flesh sky, a pulse beating under, yeah
Meat petals bloom in a bone garden
Ain't no god, no ghost gonna save you now
I sell souls at the side of the road
Would you like to take a number?

There's a highway to, to the edge, yeah
Once a night, you will drive yourself there
At the end of the road, you will find the answer
At the end of the road, you will drink your fear
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Take your time, come on
Get what you come for
Don't waste my time, come on
Get what you come for
Don't waste my time, come on
Get what you come for
Don't waste my time, come on
Get what you come for

There's a highway to, to the edge, yeah
Once a night, you will drive yourself there
At the end of the road, you will find the answer
At the end of the road, you will drink your fear

I watched you burn in the eye of my sun
(Whoa, whoa)
In the eye of my sun, yeah, yeah
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I fucked you in, in the eye of my sun
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
In the eye of my sun, yeah, yeah
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I watched you burn in the eye of my sun
In the eye of my sun, yeah, yeah
I fucked you in, in the eye of my sun
In the eye of my sun, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
