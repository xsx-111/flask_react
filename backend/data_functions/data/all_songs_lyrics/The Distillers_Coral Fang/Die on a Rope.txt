Die on a Rope Lyrics
Way-oh, way-oh, oh
Way-oh, way-oh, oh
Way-oh, way-oh, oh
Way-oh, way-oh, oh

Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die on a rope?
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die?

I wish that you didn't love me no more
I've been dead for years
Wish that you didn't own me no more
I've been here before

Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die on a rope?
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die? No, I won't

Way-oh, way-oh, oh
Way-oh, way-oh, oh
Way-oh, way-oh, oh
Way-oh, way-oh, oh
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die on a rope?
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die?

I want to draw the blood from your neck
Spill the lies in your bed
I will give you a holy white rose
Cut the tongue from your head, yeah, yeah

Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die on a rope?
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die? No, I won't

Way-oh, way-oh, oh
Way-oh, way-oh, oh

Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die on a rope?
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die?
I belong to a line of red scent
Teach the heart to reflect
The wound is wise for primal black eyes
Scarlet letter in my chest

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa-oh, yeah, yeah
Whoa-oh, yeah
Whoa-oh, yeah, yeahEmbed
