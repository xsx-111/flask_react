The Gallow Is God Lyrics
And now, my heart, it sings
Suicide
And now, my gallows stain
Of black dye
And now, my death march brings
A tear to your eye
And now, the noose, it sways
When you die

What a surprise
Whoa, what a surprise
What is the price?
What is the prize? Hey
What a surprise
Whoa, what a surprise
What is the price?
What is the prize? Hey!

And now, my heart, it splits
What a demise
And now, my gallows stain
Of red dye
And now, the noose, it smiles
When you lie
And now, my womb, it licks
When you dig deep inside
What a surprise
Whoa, what a surprise
What is the price?
What is the prize? Hey
What a surprise
Whoa, what a surprise
What is your price?
What is the prize? Hey!

Do you do it? Whoa, yeah
Do you feed it? Whoa, yeah, yeah
Do you sell it? Whoa, yeah
Do you need it? Whoa, yeah

In the sun
The willows give you shade
Oh, and how they hang
Like a guillotine blade in the sun
In the sun
The willows give you shade
Oh, and how they hang
Like a guillotine blade in the sun
Like a blade in the sun
Like a blade, ah!
What a surprise
Whoa, whoa, what a surprise
What a surprise
Whoa, whoa, what a surprise
What is the price?
Whoa, whoa, what is the price?
What is the prize?
Whoa, whoa, what is the prize?Embed
