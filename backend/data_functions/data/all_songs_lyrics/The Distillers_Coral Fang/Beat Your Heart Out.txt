Beat Your Heart Out Lyrics
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
I know

Let alone to rust alone
Yeah, you're making me
Had to run, the damage is done
Give it up, there, give it up, there's
Nothing left, so take the rest
Yeah, you're draining me
I set it light, it burns so bright
Stab it out, hey, stab it out, hey

Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
I know, yeah, I know, hey, I know

I had to run, the damage is done
I give it up there, I give it up there
I had to go, it got control
Yeah, you're breaking me
There's nothing left, so take the rest
Stab it out, hey, stab it out, hey
I set it light, it burns so bright
Yeah, you're draining me
You make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
I know, yeah, I know that it's true

Let alone to rust alone, oh, oh, oh-oh
Let alone to rust alone, oh, oh, oh-oh
Let alone to rust alone, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, ooh

Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster

(There's nothing left, so take the rest)
(There's nothing left, so take the rest)
(There's nothing left, so take the rest)
(There's nothing left, so take the rest)
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Let alone...2Embed
