Love Is Paranoid Lyrics
I step right off the edge, let the blood rush to my head
I'm going down to where the lucky ones have bled
I lift the veil up to reveal a fascination
And if you crave it, then you know that you are injured

And I'm holding on
And I'm holding on

For what you do to me, oh, baby, there's no measure
I've taken everything and now, I want to give it
I left the lights on so you stumble in devotion
So easy, so easy it's left unspoken

And I'm holding on
And I'm holding on
And I'm holding on
And I'm holding on

I've come to realize that you're the only thing I...
I'm falling all the way in
I'm falling all the way in
I've come to realize you're the only thing I want now
I've fallen all the way in (I've fallen)
I've fallen all the way in
I've fallen all the way in (I've fallen)
I've fallen all the way in
I've fallen all the way in
(I've fallen, I've fallen, I've fallen)
I've fallen all the way in (I've fallen)
I've fallen all the way in (I've fallen)Embed
