Drain the Blood Lyrics
I'm living on shattered faith
The kind that likes to restrict your breath
Never been a better time than this to
Suffocate on eternal bliss

In a city that swells with so much hate
You seem to rise above and take its place
The heart pumps until it dies
Drain the blood, the heart is wise

All my friends are murder
Hey, all my bones, no marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers away, yeah

I never met a pearl quite like you
Who could shimmer and rot at the same time through
There's never been a better time than this and
Bite the hand of the frostbitten eminence

All my friends are murder
Hey, all my bones, no marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers away, away, away, yeah
Oh whoa oh
Oh whoa whoa whoa
Oh, whoa oh
(Oh whoa oh) I'm alive in uterine
A stab in the dark, a new day has dawned
(Oh whoa whoa whoa)
(Oh, whoa oh) Open up and let it flow
I'll make it yours, so here we go

All my friends are murder
Hey, all my bones, no marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers

He's gone away, he's gone away, yeah
He's gone away, he's gone away, yeah
He's gone away, he's gone away, yeah
He's gone away, he's gone away, yeah
He's gone away, he's gone away, yeah
He's gone away, he's gone aâ€” he's gone away5Embed
