Dismantle Me Lyrics
I fancy you
But I've been destitute
And all I know dissolved
I could never re-undo you
I will always say it's so
I will always speak the truth
Descend into a noose
I could never re-undo you

I want to bury you
Yeah, I want to bury you

Vultures circle 'round
Feathers float, wings flap, beaks pound
And though my heart's exposed
I could never re-undo you
I will always bleed the truth
I will always speak and know
I was sent to cut you loose
I will never re-undo you

I want to bury you
Yeah, I want to bury you
I want to bury you
Yeah, I want to bury you
Dismantle me
Yeah, dismantle me
Yeah, dismantle me

And yes, it's warm and humid on Swanston Street
And the air is filled with electricity
And the sky is deeper than a dream
And the sky is deeper than a...

Dismantle me
(I want to bury you)
Yeah, dismantle me
(I want to bury you, yeah)
Yeah, dismantle me
(I want to bury you)
Yeah, dismantle me
(I want to bury you, yeah)
And the sky is deeper than a dream
(I want to bury you)
And the sky is deeper than a dream
(I want to bury you, yeah)
And the sky is deeper than a dreamEmbed
