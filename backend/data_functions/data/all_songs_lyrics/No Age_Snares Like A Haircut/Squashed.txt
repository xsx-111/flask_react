Squashed LyricsSt. Augustine felt a lot like me
In his apartment on Sunset Street
I've got some reasons I feel lucky to believe
My sister Mary looks a lot like me
In her flower dress
On a sick street
St. Augustine felt a lot like me
In his apartment on Sunset Street
I've got some reasons I feel lucky to believe
My sister Mary looks a lot like me
In her flower dress
On a sick streetEmbed
