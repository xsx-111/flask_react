Drippy LyricsBy measure I was gone
To see the brilliant sun
A feeling that's not felt by just anyone
By measure I was dead
To see what the ground said
A feeling that's not felt by just anyone
As two cups rest
They can't be filled until
They take a needed rest
I went down to the park
Needles all around
A feeling that's not felt by just anyone
As two cups rest
They can't be filled until
They take a needed rest
By measure I was gone
To see the brilliant sun
A feeling that's not felt by just anyone
As two cups rest
They can't be filled until
They take a needed restEmbed
