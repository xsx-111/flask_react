Primitive Plus LyricsI'm a fantasy
Nothing left to do
I'm around here
I'm consistent too
Can't hide my face
Feels like you do
Can't walk without me
A common sight
Nothing around me tells me
Way off completely
A great divide
The intensity
Is such a ride
My observance
Undoubtedly
Makes the most of me
Consistently
Nothing around me tells me
I'm better alone
Nothing around me tells me
I'm better alone
Nothing around me tells me
I'm better aloneEmbed
