Popper Lyrics
Buckets, they fill up your soul
Overreach and then you're unknown
All of this I wanted to go
I should reflect it all
All the thoughts that went in it this far
Need to know the details I see
Just a glimpse of it's all I need

I've got a lot to offer
I don't think I should bother
Little lites want me around
I've got a lot to offer
I don't think I should bother
Little lites want me around

So we started again
Overwhelming depictions are in
All the notes on the window are off
There's a reason I can't
Wait in line when there is somewhere else
All arrangements awaiting on me
Little lites just wanna be free, so
I've got a lot to offer
I don't think I should bother
Little lites want me around
I've got a lot to offer
I don't think I should bother
Little lites want me around


I've got a lot to offer
I don't think I should bother
Little lites want me around
I've got a lot to offer
I don't think I should bother
Little lites want me aroundEmbed
