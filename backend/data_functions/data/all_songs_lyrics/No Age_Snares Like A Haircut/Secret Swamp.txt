Secret Swamp Lyrics
I got to get something for myself
But I guess you're thinking something else
You've got no lumber left to use
But I guess it's all that you can do

I love the way you move, but
It's easy not to care about your footsteps
Seems so far again

I got no reason to be rude
But I guess it's complicated too
You've got an overwhelming fear
But I guess it's better that you do

I love the way you move, but
It's easy not to care about your footsteps
Seems so far again

I've got to get something for myself
But I guess you're thinking something else
You've got no lumber left to use
But I guess it's all that you can do
I love the way you move, but
It's easy not to care about your footsteps
Seems so far againEmbed
