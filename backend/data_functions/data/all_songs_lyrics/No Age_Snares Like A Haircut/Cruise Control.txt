Cruise Control Lyrics
Doesn't matter where you are
The shoe fits in just the same
Unless your mind gets blown again
We can sit, get hooked all night
In the bedroom of someone sane
But if I, if I may

Where are the good things? I don't know
All the people who to show

Doesn't matter where you've been
You all look just quite the same
And if my mind is blown again
We can drive around all night
Looking for, for someone sane
But if I, if I may

Where are the good things? I don't know
All the people who to show

Doesn't matter where you are
The shoe fits just quite the same
Unless your mind has blown again
We can sit, get hooked all night
In the bedroom of someone sane
But if I, if I may
Where are the good things? I don't know
All the people who to show
Doesn't matter where you've been
Good things
Good thingsEmbed
