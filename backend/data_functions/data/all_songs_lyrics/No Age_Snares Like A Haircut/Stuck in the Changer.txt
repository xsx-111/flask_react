Stuck in the Changer LyricsWe don't talk about it
All locked down and I'd like to go
We don't talk much now that
We don't have to
Communicate down to the place
I've found to go inside
Everywhere I face
I toss and turn
And fluctuate like
I'm caught under a riptide
We don't talk about it
All locked down and I'd like to go
Down to the place we found
To go and hide
Everywhere I face
I toss and turn
And fluctuate like I'm caught under a riptide
We don't talk much now that
We don't have to
Communicate down to the place
I've found to go inside
Everywhere I face
I toss and turn
And fluctuation like I'm caught under a riptideEmbed
