Tidal LyricsI was lying in my bed
All the face(s) I thought I saw
They were standing over me, and
Then I knew for sure
That they were there for me
And I wasn't wrong
Don't you wanna go
Down to the bitter light?
All the faces disappear
And then you know
Hurts so much
On the way down
I feel every branch and thorn for all of time
Don't you wanna face
Where other people go?
All of time we've gone and gone
We can't say no
On the brighter side
It's so quiet now
All the thoughts I thought were mine have gone goodbye
Don't you wanna go
Down to the bitter light?
All the faces disappear
And then you know
I was lying in my bed
All the face(s) I thought I saw
They were standing over me, and
Then I knew for sure
Don't you wanna face
Where other people go?
All of time we've gone and gone
We can't say no
Don't you wanna go
Down to the bitter light?
All the faces disappear
And then you know
Don't you wanna face
Where other people go?
All the time we've gone and gone
We can't say no
Down to you and me
We're all going homeEmbed
