Soft Collar Fad LyricsCollections could never understand
Beds of rot, they never can be down
Maybe I got problems
Maybe I don't but it's not for you to say
Oh, I got my heart inside a loom
Pulled apart and tearing over soon
Maybe this is progress
Maybe it's not but it's not for you to say
Maybe I got problems
Maybe I don't but it's not for you to say
Hit me with the old believing saint
Fell apart because of his mistake
Maybe I got problems
Maybe I don't too
Maybe this is progress
Maybe it's not but I don't need youEmbed
