Send Me LyricsSend me
Where should I go?
I said, send me
Where should I go?
There's so much I wish that I had
Another room perhaps
And then I wouldn't feel so bad
I said, now, send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me
Where should I go?
Straight in the other room
There's a bright light
Maybe across the sea
But that don't feel quite right
I said, now, send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me
Now, where should I go?
There's so much I wish I had done
Been better at some things
And damn I feel I've won
I said, now go
Send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me, send me
Where should I go?
There's so much I wish that I had
Another room perhaps
And then I wouldn't feel so bad
I said, now, send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me, send me
Now, where should I go?
Send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me, send me, send me
Where should I go?
Where should I go?
Where should I go?Embed
