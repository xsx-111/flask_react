Separator Lyrics
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the trees
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream

Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart
In my mouth

Like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Fallen off a giant bird that's been carrying me
(Did so much, did so much)
I fell open, I lay under
At the tip off I lost your number
I wanna slip over
And get back under

And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over (Wake me up)
Then you're wrong  (Wake me up)
If you think this is over (Wake me up)
Then you're wrong (Wake me up)

Like I've fallen out of bed (Wake me up)
From a long and vivid dream (Wake me up)
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying (Wake me up, wake me up)

When at last, you give in
When at last, you give in
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?16Embed
