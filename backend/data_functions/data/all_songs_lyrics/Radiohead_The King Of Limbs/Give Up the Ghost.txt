Give Up the Ghost Lyrics
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

Gather up the lost and their souls (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Gather up the pitiful (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)

(Into your arms)
What seems impossible (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms
I think I have had my fill (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I should give up the ghost
(Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)9Embed
