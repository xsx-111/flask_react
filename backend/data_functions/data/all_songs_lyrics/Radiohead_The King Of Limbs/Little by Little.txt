Little by Little Lyrics
Don't turn nasty now
The dusts of hell
A pillar of my salt
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell

Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been 'round you've been around enough
Ooh
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Ooh

The glue won't hold
The thread unpulls
Uncurling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal

Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
The drug that will kill you
Kill you
Oh, you
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt11Embed
