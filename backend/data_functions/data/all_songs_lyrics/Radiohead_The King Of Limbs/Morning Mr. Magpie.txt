Morning Mr. Magpie Lyrics
You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it off, give it back
You stole it off, give it back

Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
And took my memory

You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't

Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all my magic
Took my melody7Embed
