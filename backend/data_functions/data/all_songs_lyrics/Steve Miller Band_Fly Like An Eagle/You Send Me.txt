You Send Me Lyrics
Darling you send me
Darling you send me, yeah
Darling you send me (Come on baby, come on)
Honest you do (You know it)
Honest you do (Come on, don't be nervous)
Honest you do

Darling you move me
Darling you move me, yeah
Darling you move me
Honest you do
Honest you do

Oh, and at first I thought it was infatuation
But, oh, it's lasted so long
That now I find myself wanting to marry you
And take you home


Oh, and at first I thought it was infatuation
But, oh, it's lasted so long
That now I find myself wanting to marry you
And take you home
