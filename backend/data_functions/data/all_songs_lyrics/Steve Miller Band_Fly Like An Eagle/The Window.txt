The Window Lyrics
Ask my baby what she wants to be
She'll say a monkey swinging in a tree
Ask my baby what she's thinking of
She'll say there's nothing greater than love

Well, look through the window
Tell me what do you see
A beautiful planet
Peace and harmony
Think love you're surrounded
We are one you and I
Gather your leaves together
There's only love until we die
Until we die

Ask my baby what she's going through
She'll say the same thing, the same thing as you
Ask my baby what she's thinking of
She'll say there's nothing greater than love
