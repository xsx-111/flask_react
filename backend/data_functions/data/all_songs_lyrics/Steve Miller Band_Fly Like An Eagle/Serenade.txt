Serenade Lyrics
Did you see the lights
As they fell all around you
Did you hear the music
A serenade from the stars

Wake up, wake up
Wake up and look around you
We're lost in space
And the time is our own
Whoa, whoa
Oh

Did you feel the wind
As it blew all around you
Did you feel the love
That was in the air

Wake up, wake up
Wake up and look around you
We're lost in space
And the time is our own
Whoa, whoa
Oh
The sun comes up
And it shines all around you
You're lost in space
And the earth is your own

Whoa, whoa
Whoa1Embed
