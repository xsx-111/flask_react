Get Him Back Lyrics
One man, he disappoint me
He give me the gouge and he take my glee
Now every other man I see
Remind me of the one man who disappointed me
Wait till I get him back
He won't have a back to scratch
Yeah, keep turning that chin
And you will see my face
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch

So I say, and on I go
To another one who disappoint me so

Next one up, a contemptible snob
He lived to put things in their place
He did a commendable job
He put himself so low
He can hardly even look me in the face
So wait till I get him back
He won't have a back to scratch
Yeah, keep turning that chin
And you will see my face
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch
Oh, he made my blood just burn
I flipped so far, I thought that I would not return

But the last one I had who was getting my hopes up
I might've been a little fast to dismiss
I think he let me down, when he didn't disappoint me
He didn't always guess right, but he usually got my gist

So wait till I get him back
I'm gonna bring him home and I'll watch him unpack
Yeah, keep turning that chin
And you will see my face is fixed on the one
I'm gonna get back

I'm gonna get him back, I am
I'm gonna get him back
I really am
I'm gonna get him back
I'm gonna get him back
I am, I'm gonna get him back, oh yeah4Embed
