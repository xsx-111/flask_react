Not About Love Lyrics
The early cars
Already are
Drawing deep breaths past my door
And last night's phrases
Sick with lack of basis
Are still writhing on my floor
And it doesn't seem fair
That your wicked words should work in holding me down
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag and the bind
And the ammunition round
Conversation, once colored by esteem
Became dialogue
As a diagram of a play for blood
- Took a vacation; my palate got clean
Now I can taste your agenda
While you're spitting your cud
And it doesn't make sense
I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag and the bind
And the ammunition round
This is not about love
Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
This is not about love
Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache
"What is this posture I have to stare at"
- That's what he said
When I was sitting up straight
Changed the name of the game cause he lost it
He knew he was wrong
But he knew it too late
But I'm not being fair
Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
But I'd like to choose right
Take all the things
That I said
That he stole
Put 'em in a sack
Swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels, step out of his sight
Try to live in a lovelier light
This is not about love
Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
This is not about love
Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache7Embed
