Beauty of the Road LyricsLeft out on the road eight years ago
And you left too but I never really thought you would really go
If I knew then—I’s really losing you
I’d change my ways and my mind—fore I lose control
Cuz in a darkened space, we watched our souls replace
And said our ‘goodbyes’
But we didn’t know the shape
And for years now
I been hunting you down
Trying to find out
Your hiding place
Oh, at last!
You’re here in my arms again
And I don’t know how long
So I won’t waste a bit
The beauty of the road—is lost in your eyes—I drift
Softly back to when, we were young and in love
Where does it go?
You spend your whole life wishing and working all you gets the end of the rope
Oh what do we know?
You spend your whole life searching and find the thing you’re looking is what you lost so long ago
And for years now, I’ve been hunting the sound
That soft breath on the back of my neck, got me running…
Oh, at last!
You’re here in my arms again
And I don’t know how long
So I won’t waste a bit
The beauty of the road—is lost in your eyes—I drift
Softly back to when, we were young and in love
You’re here in my arms again
And I don’t know how long
So I won’t waste a bit
The beauty of the road—is lost in your eyes—I drift
Softly back to when, we were young and in love
Oh we were young
And in love
I was young
And in loveEmbed
