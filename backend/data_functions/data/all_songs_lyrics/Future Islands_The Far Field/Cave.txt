Cave LyricsIn parting ways
And parting hearts
A dress of leaves blows to the winds
Take these sacrificial remnants—untended
Bashed to dust
And trust distressed
Red cheeks—caved in
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
Cuz all we know, is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
Don't grieve anymore
Cuz all I hold, is all I own
Is this a desperate wish for dying?
Or a wish that dying cease?
The fear that keeps me going and going and going
Is the same fear that brings me to my knees
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
Cuz what was gold, is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
I won't grieve anymore
Cuz all we are, is bled and gone
I am the air, the after
Always in the clouds
Searching for some answer
Parted now, I am the shore—repeated
Becoming air
I'm finally free
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
What I can't see, can't hold to me
I don't believe anymore
I won't grieve anymore
Cuz what was gold, is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
Cuz what was gold, is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
I won't grieve anymore
Won't grieve anymore
For youEmbed
