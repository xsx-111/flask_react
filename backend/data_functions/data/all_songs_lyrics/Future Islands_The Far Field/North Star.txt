North Star LyricsI’ve broken many promises
But this one I would die to keep
When I said I’d be there tomorrow
Beside you as you sleep
I was scared, cuz I’ve lost so many things before
Kept me running from the world and from myself
You gave me second chance and hopes to run to
I couldn’t bare to spend — another day without you
I’ve gotta catch you
Freezing rain can’t keep me away
From your door, from your door
What if the sun don’t shine?
Well then the birds won’t sing
Just then the blizzard came
Covered you, half a world away
Now I’m stuck in this place, without you
Thinking—what should I do?
All I knew—I couldn’t wait—one more night
And if this plane won’t fly
Then I’ll drive…
'Cause I’ve gotta catch you
Freezing rain can’t keep me away, from you
I’m gonna catch you
Blinding snow can’t keep me away
From your door, from your door
What if the sun don’t shine
Well then the birds won’t sing
Just then the blizzard came
Covered you, half a world away, a world asleep
And I was scared
Cuz I’ve lost so many things before
Kept me running—from the world—and from myself
You gave me second chance and hopes to run to
I couldn’t bare to spend—another day without you
Cuz I’ve gotta catch you
Freezing rain can’t keep me away, from you
I’ve gotta find you
Hurricanes can’t keep me away….from you
Fire and chains can’t keep me away…from you
Falling planes can’t keep me away…from you
From you…
From youEmbed
