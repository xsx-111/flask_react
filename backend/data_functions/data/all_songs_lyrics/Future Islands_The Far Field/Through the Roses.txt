Through the Roses LyricsCatch me laughing
Catch me drinking past the dawn
Catch me singing
Catch me beaming—open armed
Don’t watch me weeping
Don’t watch me weep into my palms
Don’t watch me leaving, I’ll be gone
Kiss me mother, Kiss me father
Fore I go
Don’t want to leave you
But I’m sorry... I can’t hold
And you see me, through the roses
Through the lights and the smoke and the screen
I’m no one better
I’m no better than you and I'm scared
Just searching for truth
It’s not easy, just being human
And the lights and the smoke and the screens
Don’t make it better
I’m no stronger than you and I’m scared
I don't know what to do
I’m scared
That I can’t pull through
In the weak of my soul
The temptation to look inside my wrist—it grows
The cut is waiting
The cut is waxing in its hold
The clutch of nothing
The curse of wanting
Takes me whole
And you see me, through the roses
Through the lights and the smoke and the screen
I’m no one better
I’m no better than you and I’m scared
Just searching for truth
It’s not easy, just being human
And the lights and the smoke and the screens
Don’t make it better
I’m no stronger than you and I’m scared
I don't know what to do
I’m scared
But we can pull through—together
Together
We can pull throughEmbed
