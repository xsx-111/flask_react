Time on Her Side LyricsThe sea was large today
Just as any other day
But something broke in me
Watching on this winter’s eve
Like a voice, that I’d been trying to hide
Pulled me close
And out into the undertow
I can’t beat it
Oh! The sirens sing me home
Just can’t release it
I didn’t have the strength to go
She’s a garden rose and blossoms head to toe
And even when she leaves her golden shadow stings
I can’t beat it
Every time she goes, cuts me even deeper
If only I’d the strength to go
Like she does
But she’s got time on her side
And she’s free to decide
Because she’s got time on her side
To be young is divine
And scaling the dunes to sea
Where the white wall feeds
Gets me no closer to peace
From the grips that she holds on me
Oh! I can’t beat it
Every time she goes
Cuts a lil deeper
So the wound will never close
If only I could beat it
She wouldn’t look away for woe
But it finds me when I’m sleeping
And wakes me in a fevered low
Like she does
But she’s got time on her side
And she’s free to decide
Because she’s got time on her side
She’s so free, it’s sublime
I just wonder if I’m on her mind
As she’s on mine, all the time
And I want her to know that I’m on her side
I’m on her side
The sea was large today
Just as any other dayEmbed
