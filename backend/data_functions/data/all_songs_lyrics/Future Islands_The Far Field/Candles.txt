Candles LyricsSoften your penitence
It’s not your fate
Release the weight
Of shouldering after-thoughts
Of watching them fade
Oh I can relate
But deciding your innocence
It’s not mine to make
You’re not mine to save
You’re not mine…
Where does it go?
Where does it go?
This one, for the last time
Baby, I know
A little candle like you
Don’t deserve the hurt you’re going through
Let me take it from you
Where does it go?
Where does it go?
This time, for the last time
Baby, I know
A little candle like you
Don’t deserve the pain you’re going through
Let me take it away
You flicker so gently
Yet light up the hall
We dance on the walls
As shadows flee after you
The great and the small
You better us all
You better us…
Where does it go?
Where does it go?
This time, for the last time
Baby, I know
A little candle like you
Don’t deserve the hurt you’re going through
Let me take it away
Where does it go?
It comes and goes
This time, for the last time
Baby, I know
A little candle like you
Don’t deserve the pain you’re going through
You shined a light for me
Reflecting light for you
I’m too far to save
So let me take your pain
Let me take it from you
Let me take it away
Where does it go?
Where does it go?
This time, for the last time
Baby, I know
A little candle like you
Gave me the strength that pulled me through
Now let me take it from you
This sadness from youEmbed
