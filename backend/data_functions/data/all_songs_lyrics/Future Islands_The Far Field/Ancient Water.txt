Ancient Water LyricsAncient like the water
Dissolves my selfish leanings and all the others
Guide me
You beside me
With conviction—my lost invention
My child is starving
But you keep me, you keep me
I’ve been locked and you’re the key
You keep me, you keep me
You keep me ’til I’m ready to be free
Too many wasted days and nights
Obsessed with the flickering bits of my life
Forgetting what giving and living can be—what it can mean
First forgiving myself and stepping outside of my own apathy
To see, I just want to be
Patient like the forest
Stood through thousands fallen
Watched the changing evening a million times or more
Lead me to the water
Take me to the other side
And know how much it means, to me
Cuz you keep me, you keep me
I’ve been locked and you’re the key
Too many wasted days and nights
Obsessed with the flickering bits of my life
I’ve forgotten what giving and living can be—what it can mean
First steps to being better is doing the smallest things
Cuz you keep me, you keep me
You keep me I’ve been locked and you’re the key
You keep me, you keep me
You keep me ’til I’m strong enough to see
To be freeEmbed
