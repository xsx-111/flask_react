Day Glow Fire LyricsOur second step was river quiet
We walked along the Rockies, stones admired
Calcite greens and feather bones divided
Morning’s first born and a day-glow fire
Day glow fire
In your upstairs room, I sit in silence
No longer a guest in your bed
Or in your heart or head
Surrounded by your things and memories entire
Not finding any trace of me
I know it’s time to leave
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run
I packed my bags last night
I always pick the strangest ways to say, ‘goodbye’
But I had to come and see that this had died
I had to look into your eyes
Just one last time
Just one last time
Oh I had to look into your eyes!
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run
And walk into the sun1Embed
