Shadows LyricsMy window opens on your heart
Yet shadows divide our worlds with loss
The light setting, in the corner of my room
Isn't enough, but is it for you?
A melody that trails and falls, yet never fully blooms
Plays like an old song
That’s just out of tune
Why can't you just break free?
Is it the heat dreams, that fevers brought you?
These old shadows (they're just shadows)
They turn me like a screw
And dance the dance of Dante, entreating you
They're just shadows (these old shadows)
Won't let me get close to you
I'm walking a ghost, through the Garden of Eden’s ruins
(I’m tryna get through to you)
The light setting, in the corner of my room
Plays like an old song that's just out of tune
A melody that trails and falls yet never fully blooms
Is it enough? well is it for you?
Why won't you just take me?
Is it the bee's sting that honey haunts you?
Is it the sweet things you fear--you'll lose
If I get near, to you?
Before we’re through…
These old shadows (These old shadows)
Parade you like a fool, you’re living in dust
While a ghost hangs coats on you
These old shadows (They're just shadows)
Crotcheted and trembling, nude
I’m walking a ghost but I wanna walk next to you
I wanna break through to you
The light setting in the corner of my room
Isn’t enough, well is it for you?
The light setting, in the corner of your room
It’s more than enough, for me and for you
For me and for you1Embed
