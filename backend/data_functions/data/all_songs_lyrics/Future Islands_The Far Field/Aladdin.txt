Aladdin LyricsDoubled the top knot
Flew out the lattice door
Do what he wouldn’t
Do what he couldn’t do
No lack of ‘wouldn’t’ could be my undoing
No lack of trying
No lack of sighing ‘loo’
Weave songs of loving late
Dream songs of dying
Recite the oakwood flame
Rings count my olden days
I’ve seen the beaches
Breached the peak of ‘please’ and ‘thanks’
I’ve seen my features age
My fingers strange
From the dew
From the dew, of the fields
We grew
And I built a ship for two
It waits for me and you
In the dew of the fields
Is it real?
Is it real?
I’ll show you the way
Just walk beside the low stream until it fades
Into a melon colored field
The wind will know your name
And you don’t have to run
You don’t have to change
Don’t ever change…
We were the candles that lit up the snow on dusty roads
We were the animals breathing life into June just to see faith
Blessed by the cannibal moon and the spoon dipping deep to your nose
Stressed by the distance of shoes and the bridges too far to be named
Was it real?
When we held our hands close to flame
Just to feel
I’ll show you the way
Just walk beside the low stream until it fades
Into a honey colored field
The wind will know your name
And you don’t have to change
You don’t have to change
Love is real
Our love was real
It’s a hand
It’s a hold
It’s a shield
Our love was real
Our love was real
It’s to hope
It’s to dream
It’s to heal
It’s to heal2Embed
