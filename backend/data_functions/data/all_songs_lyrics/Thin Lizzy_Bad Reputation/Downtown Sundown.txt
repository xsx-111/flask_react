Downtown Sundown LyricsIf you want your freedom
There is nothing planned
If you really need him
I will understand
Please believe in love
I believe there is a God above
For love
And he's coming, yes, he's coming
If you want to fly
Then fly away
All the cloudy skies
Belong to yesterday
Please believe in love
I believe there is a God above
For love
And he's coming, yes, he's coming
In the shadows the swallow dies
No one knows the hobo hides
There is no need to apologise
This is the story of a downtown sundown
If you climb the mountain
Then you will see
There is no great distance
Between the Lord and me
Please believe in love
I believe there is a God above
For love
And he's coming, yes, he's coming
In the shadows the swallow dies
No one knows the hobo hides
There is no need to apologise
This is the story of a downtown sundownEmbed
