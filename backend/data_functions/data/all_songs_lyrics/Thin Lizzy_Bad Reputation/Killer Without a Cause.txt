Killer Without a Cause LyricsHe made a big impression
When he walked across the room
And I must make my confession
I might have spoke too soon
He's a killer without a cause
The time is right to settle scores
On the streets he lives again
Down the alley and round the bend
On the beat beneath the light
An angel comes to claim the night
From the streets this rebel shall rise
And his soul shall soar through the skies
The same old confrontation
At the bar in the saloon
But it's just another tricky situation
The underworld operation lies in ruins
He's a killer without a cause
The time is right to settle scores
On the streets he lives again
Down the alley and round the bend
On the beat beneath the light
An angel comes to claim the night
From the streets this rebel shall rise
And his soul shall soar through the skiesEmbed
