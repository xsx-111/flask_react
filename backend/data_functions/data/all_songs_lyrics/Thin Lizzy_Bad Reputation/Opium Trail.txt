Opium Trail LyricsI took a line that leads you to the opium trail
Oriental eyes reveal the lies, deceit, betrayal
On this journey behold one who travels far
You called him fool, but now you are
The wizard wanders through the world he made from dreams
The splashing whirlpool drowns the frightening screams
Exotic dancers, flashing lancers, this mysterious space
The fanfare advances, the warlord falls from grace
It clears your pain
But it's got you claimed again, my love
You feel the need, but it lets you bleed
You must concede, my love
No-one to blame, no shame
You crave again and again, my love
No use to plead
From you it feeds your greed, my love
It's got you, my love
I took a line that comes from the golden states of Shan
The smuggler's trail that leads you to the opium den
The Chinese connection refines to heroin
Depart the heart you crave again
It clears all pain
But your soul, it's claimed again, my love
You feel the need, but it lets you bleed
You must concede, my love
No-one to blame, no shame
You crave again and again, my love
No use to plead
From you it feeds your greed, my loveEmbed
