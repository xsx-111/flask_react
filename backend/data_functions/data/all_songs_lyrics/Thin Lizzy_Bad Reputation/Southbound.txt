Southbound LyricsThe boom time it is over
A ghost town is all that's left here
The gold rush it is over
And depression days draw near
Tonight after sundown
I'm going to pack my case
I leave without a sound
Disappear without a trace
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
Drifting like a drover
Chasing my career
From the ships docked in the harbour
New horizons will appear
Tumbling with the tumbleweed
Down the open road
Taking only what I need
Before my head explodes
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
Hey, you're not getting any younger
The wild west has already been won
Northern nights are growing colder
And the old eastern ways are gone
So tonight after sundown
You must go from this place
Without a tear, without a frown
Disappear without a trace
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
Oh I'm going southbound
New horizons will appear
I'm going southbound, dear
Without a word, without a sound
I've got to leave this ghost town
Oh I'm going southbound
Let's go southEmbed
