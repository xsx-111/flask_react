Bad Reputation LyricsYou've got a bad reputation
That's the word out on the town
It gives a certain fascination
But it can only bring you down
You better turn yourself around
Turn yourself around
Turn it upside down
Turn yourself around
You had bad breaks
Well, that's tough luck
You play too hard, too much
You rough stuff
You're too sly, so cold
That bad reputation has made you old
Turn yourself around
Turn yourself around
Turn it upside down
Turn yourself aroundEmbed
