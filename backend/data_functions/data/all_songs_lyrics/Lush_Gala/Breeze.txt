Breeze LyricsPink cloud sits sky high
Skips to the starlight
Rains tinsel whispers
Breeze blows away
I crawl inside me
My eyes to heaven
Pink cloud sits sky high
Breeze blows away
Silver air everywhere, doesn't care
But silver winds cut my skin everywhere
I crawl inside me
My eyes to heaven
Pink cloud sits sky high
Breeze blows away
Breathe in green velvet
My lips taste warm earth
Pink cloud sits sky high
Breeze blows away
Summer sun, so much fun, colours run
Hot summer's kiss, cloudless bliss burns my tongueEmbed
