Bitter LyricsJust don't imagine that I'll still remember you
Don't even think I'll try
I'll take my memories and drown them in my glass
And then I'll drink a toast of bitterness and wash you from my heart
I count the blessings that took you away from me
I laugh to think I cried
I don't need what you got I don't miss what you do
'Cause I can raise my glass and drink a toast of bitterness to you
And now my mind recalls no memory of you
And so I raise a smile and drink a toast of bitterness to you
Just don't imagine that I still remember you
Don't even think I care
You took your love elsewhere and I drank mine away
With bitter thoughts of you that washed my memories of you awayEmbed
