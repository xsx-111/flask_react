Thoughtforms LyricsCome on, little man, now that all's said and done
All that I'm asking is you show me some fun
I need purple views and scenic greens
They can make me soar and touch extremes
I just fell down from whitest skies
And now I start to realise
And all the colours talk to me
And if I had wings then I could take you in
I'd stay on the ground and I could teach you things
The grass is strewn with blades of gold
These sights and songs I have been told
All hopes desires that seem to sing
Come on, little man, now your time's nearly through
Colours are dripping down red and blue
I'm standing in the middle of a great glass ball
I'm told that I've nothing but I'm having it all
I just rose up from blackest seas
My eyes were opened so widely
And it's a shame to end this wayEmbed
