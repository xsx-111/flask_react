De-Luxe Lyrics
I've been waiting on the slide
Suggest I open wide
No incentive to hide
Happy coursing through my veins
Don't even know my name
When I'm up, you're coming down
When I'm up, you're coming down

Inside of me, some sight to see
Some sight to feel our earthy bed

When we're wrapped in polythene
What's that supposed to mean?
Paper flowers bring me luck
No birds in sight to fear
Stick six in you, my dear
When I'm up, you're coming down
When I'm up, you're coming down

Some say I'm vague and I'd easily fade
Foolish parade of fantasy
Drink in your eyes, drink in your sighs
Crossing my thighs, my aching legs
When we're wrapped in polythene
What's that supposed to mean?
Paper flowers bring me luck
No birds in sight to fear
Stick sticks in you, my dear
When I'm up, you're coming down
When I'm up, you're coming down

Inside of me, some sight to see
Some sight to feel our earthy bed
Drink in your eyes, drink in your sighs
Crossing my thighs, my aching legs

Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo2Embed
