Sweetness and Light LyricsSee my life (I've been so tired)
See my self (I've been uptight)
See my life (I've been so tired)
See my sight (I could disappear)
See with you memories fading fast
And with you it's never going to last
You are the sweetness in my eyes
You are an apple in disguise
See with you
I never seemed to look the other way
Only to stay, only to breathe
Only to see
That space and light is what I really need
You are the sweetness in my eyes
You are an apple in disguise
I never wanted to tell lies
You are the sweetness in my eyes
You are the juice I need for life
You are the sweetness in my eyesEmbed
