Downer LyricsIn me
You'll see
Dirt flows
Freely
But
You may find
That my thoughts
Are unkind
Pure life
Deeds knife
Cuts off
My life
But
As you see
Hurting you
You bless me
I always wanted to be blind
After the act, close my eyes
I always longed for the deep
Then I just wanted to be asleep
Bloodstream
Cruel dream
Never
Make clean
Down
By my side
I feel safe
When I hide
So
Can you see
That my thoughts
Are for me?Embed
