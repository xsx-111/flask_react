Etheriel LyricsI know it hurts to see
That in the end they sympathized with me
And though it hurts to say
It couldn't happen any other way
I remember when you were free
No one else then you came to me
Cursed you then that it couldn't last
All the laughs we had in the past
And if it hurts you too
I hope you know that I'm still fond of you
And if its still unfair
Remember that I thought you never cared
Sing to me, comfort me, turned away
Someone else takes my place
And so you made your choice
When I needed most to hear your voice
But you were never there
And that was when I thought you never cared1Embed
