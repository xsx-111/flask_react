Second Sight LyricsPeel back empty night
Grey dawn breaks into white
Sun climbing the sky
Your eyes reflecting the light
Clouds out of sight
But when the day is through
Will I see you again
Keep your eyes on me
Don't let go of my hand
Running together
We go together so well
I can tell
Run where I run
Play what I play
Do what I do
But when this day's through
Will I see you againEmbed
