Leaves Me Cold LyricsDreams deep heat teasing my mind
Sleep peels sweet stealing my sighs
She breathes deep when he's inside
Dreams deep heat poisons my mind
Inside me there's a separate world
It's winning and I'm losing control
I'm coming but my eyes are closed
I'm coming but it leaves me cold
Night's bright lights dim in the day
Blind eyes smile at you today
I find I'm falling away
My eyesight's never the same
Inside me there's a separate girl
She's winning and I'm losing control
She coming but my eyes are closed
She's coming but I wake up and it leaves me coldEmbed
