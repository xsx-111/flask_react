Baby Talk Lyrics
Swallowed her down, she's inside me
She's struggling now, she can't break free
And my eyes are closed, my lips are sealed
She can't escape but I can feel

Kicks in me
Kicks in me
Kicks in me
Kicks in me

Climbing my spine, she's inside me
Wants to escape, wants to breathe
And I wish I could tell you what she feels
And I wish I could hear when she speaks

In my sleep
In my sleep
In my sleep
In my dreamsEmbed
