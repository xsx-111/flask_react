Hey Hey Helen LyricsSo at last you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
It's the price you paid
To become a woman of today
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy
Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
Though you're free at last
And beginning to forget the past
Does it make you sad
When you think about the life you had
But you're right, you had to take a second chance
So you fight to find your freedom
Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
Hey hey Helen
What's the matter with you
Hey hey Helen
Don't you know what to do
Ahah, yes you do yes you do
Ahah, yes you do yes you do
Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
Hey hey Helen
What's the matter with you
Hey hey Helen
Don't you know what to doEmbed
