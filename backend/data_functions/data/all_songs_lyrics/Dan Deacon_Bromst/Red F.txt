Red F LyricsTen bees, all gold turn into snow
Life's crows and covers ran for show
We come and look down on our knees
Everything gets covered in disease
I got plenty of time but nothing to say
You, you talk all the time and smile all the way
Ten bees, all gold turn into snow
Life's crows and covers ran for show
We come and look down on our knees
Everything gets covered in disease
Old unbreaking tide, I hear you
Coming closer, I won't dear you
I know where you bring the inlorn
Give me courage to us love storm
A modern tire in a fiery tree
And our cat bars growing near the sea
(Old unbreaking tide, I hear you)
And the sharks rise up and bend in the stars
And the light turns hard and crash the yard
(Coming closer, I won't dear you)
And the highways burn and the banks all explode
And the big old bombs turned the back of your throat
(I know where you bring the inlorn)
And the green lake's dry and the fish all know
And the bees have nothing and the stars below
(Give me courage to us love storm)
A modern tire in a fiery tree
And our cat bars growing near the sea
(Old unbreaking tide, I hear you)
And the sharks rise up and bend in the stars
And the light turns hard and crash the yard
(Coming closer, I won't dear you)
And the highways burn and the banks all explode
And the big old bombs turned the back of your throat
(I know where you bring the inlorn)
And the green lake's dry and the fish all know
And the bees have nothing and the stars below
(Give me courage to us love storm)
A modern tire in a fiery tree
And our cat bars growing near the sea
(Old unbreaking tide, I hear you)
And the sharks rise up and bend in the stars
And the light turns hard and crash the yard
(Coming closer, I won't dear you)
And the highways burn and the banks all explode
And the big old bombs turned the back of your throat
(I know where you bring the inlorn)
And the green lake's dry and the fish all know
And the bees have nothing and the stars below
(Give me courage to us love storm)
I got plenty of time but nothing to say
You, you talk all the time and smile all the wayEmbed
