Build Voice LyricsBeware, I'm home, I think you know
Behind the stone, a pinch will grow a mighty roar
Behold the stone, it gleams like gold
Out of control, the beasts unknown and untold
Hello my ghost, I'm here, I'm home
I hope you know about the long lazy road
Behold the stone, it gleams like gold
Out of control, the beasts unknown and untold
Oh oh oh, the stone as I'm told unfolds
Hello my ghost, I'm here, I'm home
I hope you know about the long lazy road
Behold the stone, it gleams like gold
Out of control, the beasts unknown and untold
And so my ghost, it leaves my home
But not for long because it's cold where it goesEmbed
