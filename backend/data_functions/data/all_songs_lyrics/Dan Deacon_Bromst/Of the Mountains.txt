Of the Mountains LyricsBeen round this road so many times
Feel like it's skin is part of mine
This taste of milk is almost gone
Still got my shame, but not for long!
Been wrong so many times before
But never quite like this
And oh, it rained, but the rain all turned to piss
I hope to make it home one day
I doubt that day will come
I know, by now, that my days they're all goneEmbed
