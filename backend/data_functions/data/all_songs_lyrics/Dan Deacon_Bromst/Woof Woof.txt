Woof Woof LyricsBeast Antelope grazed the fields today
Beast Lion eats fat and flesh away
Least little bugs clean the bones and say
Without us a price you'd all Pay
Be real slow like a glue
Feast with the hawks and let the hawks feast you
A little piece, a little beast
Clean a little teeth with the tiny little cream priest
I feel low
But now i know that soon go
How and when's what I don't know
When it comes i hope that I'll still glow
Some bees are better off left alone
Some bees feel better off in the throne
Some bees are friendly like you and me
Some bees are lazy

Some bees feel better off in the throne

Please go wild
Let your skin free
Hold your head up
Beasts the big see
See the stone glow
Let the mold grow
Move in deeper
Go where they won't

Please go wild
Let your skin free
Hold your head up
Beasts the big see
See the stone glow
Let the mold grow
Move in deeper
Go where they won'tEmbed
