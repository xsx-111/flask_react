Pretty Grids Lyrics
There's a sound that's true, but the voice is new
And a half-dancing attempt to learn your name
Right place and time for the haze and lights
There's a chance I meet your eyes if I move in

Someday we might not bother
Line up the way we should
Why not? The sun just feels too good
Sometimes the right one finds us
Who cares why they do?
Why not? We jump because we could

When the fight is done and the feelings come
Is it more than what you thought or even want?
No place feels right for a busy mind
However goes the night, it's what you've got

Someday we might not bother
Line up the way we should
Why not? The sun just feels too good
Sometimes the right one finds us
Who cares why they do?
Why not? We jump because we could
All I see is up-close magic
Only sweet because it ends
All I see is up-close magic
Only sweet because it ends

Someday we might not bother
Line up the way we should
Why not? The sun just feels too good
Sometimes the right one finds us
Who cares why they do?
Why not? We jump because we couldEmbed
