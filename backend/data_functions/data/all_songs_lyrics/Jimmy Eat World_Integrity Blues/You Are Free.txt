You Are Free Lyrics
Riddles keep me up at night
A lonely feeling to be understood
You told me often how it was
But I wasn't ready to hear it so plain
Amazing the effort we put in
Amazing the emotional bridges, tunnels, roads, and ways
We go around what's one step from our face
I see it clearly now

Honey, you are free
As much as you can stand to be
You are free
And it's anything you think that means
You are free
To be who you want
What you need
Yeah, who you want
What you need
Baby, you are free

Everyone has their opinions
But I'm the one that's gotta walk it
So much fear to get over
And so much pain to get past
Wish there was a easy way through
Wish there was a way to learn it all
And have my bright new shiny tools
Without the cost attached
I think we've paid enough

Honey, you are free
As much as you can stand to be
You are free
And it's anything you think that means
You are free
To be who you want
What you need
Yeah, who you want
What you need
Baby, you are free

I think we've paid enough
I think we've paid enough

Honey, you are free
As much as you can stand to be
You are free
And it's anything you think that means
You are free
To be who you want
What you need
Yeah, who you want
What you need
Baby, you are freeEmbed
