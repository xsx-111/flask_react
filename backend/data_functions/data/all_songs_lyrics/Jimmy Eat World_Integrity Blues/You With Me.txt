You With Me Lyrics
I don't stand a chance
Against the glow of answers
Lighting up your face across the pillow landscape
The list of things
I feel is crazy
News to me that I would need a second wake up

It's all been happening
Like they said it might
Am I weak if I want to fight?

What makes our love so hard to be?
Is it you? Or is that you with me?
For just the possibility
I'd have given anything
We play along, we sell
But only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you? Or is it that you with me?
You with me
You with me

Pull like magnets
Cloud of static
The air between is punishing, but nothing happens
Scared to say it
Even to yourself
Am I weak if I want to help?

What makes our love so hard to be?
Is it you? Or is that you with me?
For just the possibility
I'd have given anything
We play along, we sell
But only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you? Or is it that you with me?
You with me
You with me


Wrong I'm certain
And it's sad to think of
Expecting different outcomes with a better question

Fear and comfort
Are both one the same
Am I weak if I want to wait?
What makes our love so hard to be?
Is it you? Or is that you with me?
For just the possibility
I'd have given anything
We play along, we sell
But only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you? Or is it that you with me?
You with me
You with me
We play along, we sell
But only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you? Or is it that you with me?
You with me
You with me
Is it you? Or is it that you with me?
You with me
