Get Right Lyrics
Hands will take their place
Far from intentions made
Disguised as patience, time gets wasted
Now is for the now, so get loud

I'm, I'm destination addicted
I just gotta be some place else
Never good time, never feel the space to get it right
Get right

Hands will find their way
To eyes inches from my face
My heart gets beating, I drink freely
How to hold it down, hold it down?

I'm, I'm destination addicted
I just gotta be some place else
Never good time, never feel the space to get it right
Get right

Okay, okay, enough
Let me explain
Okay, okay, enough
Get on with it
Maybe if I stand up straight
One small thing I can change
Maybe if I, maybe If I...
I'm, I'm destination addicted
I just gotta be some place else
Never good time, never feel the space to get it right
