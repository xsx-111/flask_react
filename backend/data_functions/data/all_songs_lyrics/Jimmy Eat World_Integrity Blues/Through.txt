Through Lyrics
Sounds so great, everything you're saying
Do lies out loud change anything?
Go get mad
Have a child's tantrum
'Til everyone knows how wronged you've been

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through

Damn, there's no practical advantage
To chase that love from the people hurting you
See all kinds, ones who think they need it
The ones who'll take it
Then, the ones who know the truth

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through
Slow things down, baby check your motives
Sleep at night and stand up straight
Keep in mind, there's a big, big difference
Between letting go and running away

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is throughEmbed
