It Matters Lyrics
We're losing several steps ahead, it's strange
Anything you do, any way you move
Then with any strain it feels so helpless
A trap we build ourselves, we can't be without

When you pull away, I say it matters
With a quiet face, I break, I shatter
Then okay, we'll trade, but after
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pull away

I imagine talks that last all night
Never bring it up, but every day I want to
I think about us dancing, but it's not something we do
Well there's my dream, doesn't it sound good to you?

When you pull away, I say it matters
With a quiet face, I break, I shatter
Then okay, we'll trade, but after
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pull away

When you pull away, I say it matters
With a quiet face, I break, I shatter
Then okay, we'll trade, but after
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pull away
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pull away1Embed
