Have A Little Faith In Me LyricsWhen the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Just let my love throw a spark
And have a little faith in me
And when the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these loving arms a try baby
And have a little faith in me
And have a little faith in me
And Have a little faith in me
And Have a little faith in me
And Have a little faith in me
When your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
Come here darlin'
From a whisper start
To have a little faith in me
And when your back's against the wall
Just turn around and you, you will see
I will catch you, I will catch your fall baby
Just have a little faith in me
And have a little faith in me
And Have a little faith in me
And Have a little faith in me
And Have a little faith in me
Well I've been loving you for such a long time girl
Expecting nothing in return just for for you to have a little faith in me
Cause see time, time is our friend
Cause for us there is no end
And all you gotta do is a have a little faith in me
I said I will hold you up
I will hold you up
And your love gives me strength in love
So have a little faith in love
I said a hey hey all you gotta do for me girl is have a little bit of faith in me
I said a I said a hey...Embed
