Learning How To Love You LyricsI'm 34 years old now
And I've come to you
Baby I don't even know how
I got through
From the first kiss in the schoolyard
Til the last heart broke in two
I didn't know it would be so hard
Learning how to love you
There was a life that I was living
In some cracked rearview
Where no future was given
To a heart untrue
Still I thought that I was so strong
That my will could force me through
I didn't know it would be so long
Learning how to love you
I might have never realized
The courage in your kiss
And the sweet forgiveness in your eyes
Babe I know you've walked a mile
In someone else's shoes
Maybe you've left some faces smiling
Walking off your blues
And I don't pretend to know how
You ever saw it through
Cause I only got to where I am now
Learning how to love youEmbed
