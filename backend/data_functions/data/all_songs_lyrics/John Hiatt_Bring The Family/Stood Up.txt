Stood Up LyricsI stood up for the first time
When I was just eleven months old
And ever since that day, my mama said
I never done what I was told
I never stood for nothing too much
All through my schooling years
But I stood as much as I could stand
I guess that's why I'm still standing here
Yes, and
I stood up
When love called my name, baby
I stood up
Even when that love was all in vain, baby
I got stood up once
And left out in the pouring rain, baby
But I stood up
And I'd do it again
I guess she never understood what she could do
With all her flaming red hair
But I could not stand the heat in her kitchen
So, Jack, I got out of there
I stood up to get a pack of cigarettes
Down at the corner store
New she's standing in some corner of my heart
Behind the kitchen screen door
I stood up
When love called my name, baby
I stood up
Even when that love was all in vain, baby
I got stood up once
And left out in the pouring rain, baby
But I stood up
And I'd do it again
I don't know about you
But there's a lot of things I never stood up to
Even as I turned and walked away
I guess that's why I'm standing on my own
Two feet today
Now they gave last call for alcohol
And no one has to carry me home
You see I only work here now man
My drinking days are long gone
I couldn't stand up after one, no
'Til twenty had me down on the floor
Now the first one doesn't get me
Even though I'm still the last one out the door
I stood up
When love called my name, baby
I stood up
Even when that love was all in vain, baby
I got stood up once
And left out in the pouring rain, baby
But I stood up
And I'd do it againEmbed
