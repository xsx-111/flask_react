Thing Called Love LyricsDon't have to humble yourself to me
I ain't your judge or your king
Baby, you know you ain't no Queen of Sheba
We may not even have our dignity, no
This could be just a prideful thing
Baby, we can choose, y'know, we ain't no amoebas
But are you ready for this thing called love
Don't come from me and you, it come from up above
I ain't no porcupine, take off your kid gloves
Are you ready for this thing called love
And you ain't some icon carved out of soap
Sent down here to clean up my reputation
Baby, I ain't your Prince Charming
Now, we can live in fear or act out of hope
For some kind of peaceful situation
Baby, don't know why the cry of love is so alarming
But are you ready for this thing called love
Don't come from you and me, it come from up above
I ain't no porcupine, take off your kid gloves
Are you ready for this thing called love
The ugly ducklings don't turn into swans
And glide off down the lake
Whether your sunglasses are off or on
You only see the world you make
Before the laws of God and the laws of man
I take you for my wife, yeah
To love, honour, cherish and obey
Now, I didn't have no plans to live
This kind of life, no
It just worked out that way
And are you ready for this thing called love
Don't come from you and me, it come from up above
I ain't no porcupine, take off your kid gloves
Are you ready for it
Are you ready for this thing called love
Don't come from you and me, it come from up above
I ain't no porcupine, take off your kid gloves
Are you ready for the thing called love
Just a crazy little thing called love
Just a crazy little thing called love
It's just a crazy little thing called love
It's just a crazy little thing called love
It's just a crazy little thing called love
Oh, it's just a crazy little thing called love, baby
It's just a crazy little thing called love, baby
It's just a crazy little thing called loveEmbed
