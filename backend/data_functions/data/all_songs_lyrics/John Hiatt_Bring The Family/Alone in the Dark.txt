Alone in the Dark LyricsIt's a lonely picture
Of an empty glass
It's a still life study
Of a drunken ass
And he howls at the moon
Hoping the sun don't come up too fast
I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone on my knees at last
Alone in the dark
It's extreme self pity
And frozen fear
Cause I want you with me
And you're not here
So I rub my nose in it babe
'Til the roses smell just like death
I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm al alone and drawing whisky breath
Alone in the dark
My head is spinning baby, what went wrong
I swear to God I tried
Just turned around one day and you were gone
Now these tears I have to cry
Alone in the dark baby, I'm all alone
I'm all alone, I'm all alone
Since the night you left
I just couldn't stand myself anyway
I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone on my knees at last
Alone in the dark
I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone in the dark now baby
I'm all alone on my knees at last
Alone in the dark
