Tip Of My Tongue LyricsAn empty house
Is the only thing standin'
Between our lives
And the speed of sound
Some words flew out
And made a crash landin'
No love survived
Not a trace could be found
I broke your heart
With the back of my mind
From the tip of my tongue
To the end of the line
I walked away
And you stood there tremblin'
Like a leaf
In the autumn chill
Now this house won't say, no
What I'm still rememberin'
Three angry words
And a love that they killed
I broke your heart
With the back of my mind
From the tip of my tongue
To the end of the line
You couldn't say how much it hurt you
And I couldn't see the damage I'd done
'Til I watched the greatest love I've known
All come down to a slip of the tongue
Well I'd take it back
But time won't let me
No, time just takes
You further away
I watched you pack
A house full of memories
Where did you go
Lord, what did I say?
I broke your heart
With the back of my mind
From the tip of my tongue
To the end of the lineEmbed
