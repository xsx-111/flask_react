Thank You Girl LyricsYou're a little on the thin side
But that's alright
You stood by me baby
When I didn't think we'd ever see daylight
Rolled out of California
Like a couple of thieves
Now we're rolling in clover babe
We didn't read this in no tea leaves
My fate was sealed before I met you darling
I was halfway down a shallow grave
So little room for you to catch me falling
Still you took the little love I saved
I wanna thank you girl
I wanna thank you girl
I wanna thank you girl
I wanna thank you girl
It's a matter of opinion
But I think you're fine
As a matter of fact babe
They couldn't hold a candle to your kind
If all men are equal
This must be against the law
'Cause I can't help but feeling
I'm one up on my brother when night falls
'Cause in your arms I get the real love story
No fairy tale from somewhere back in time
In the dawn you're like a morning glory
Opening up for my sweet light to shine
I wanna thank you girl
I wanna thank you girl
I wanna thank you girl
I wanna thank you girlEmbed
