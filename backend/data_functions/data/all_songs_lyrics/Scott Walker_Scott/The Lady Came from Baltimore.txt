The Lady Came from Baltimore Lyrics
Lady came from Baltimore
All she wore was lace
Didn't know that I was poor
She never saw my place

I was there to steal the money
Take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none

Lady's name was Susan Moore
Daddy was the law
Didn't know that I was poor
And lived outside the law
Daddy said I was a thief
Didn't have the love
But I was Susan's true belief
Married her for love

I was there to steal the money
Take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none
Now she lived and built a wall
To keep the robbers out
Didn't care a thing at all
That's what I'm about

I was there to steal the money
Take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none

Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with noneEmbed
