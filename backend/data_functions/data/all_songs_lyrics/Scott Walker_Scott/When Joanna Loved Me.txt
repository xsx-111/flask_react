When Joanna Loved Me LyricsToday is just another day
Tomorrow is a guess
But yesterday
Oh what I'd give for yesterday
To relive one yesterday
And its happiness
When Joanna loved me
Every town was Paris
Every day was Sunday
Every month was May
When Joanna loved me
Every sound was music
Music made of laughter
Laughter that was bright and gay
But when Joanna left me
May became December
But even in December
I remember
Her touch
Her smile
And for a little while
She loves me
And once again its Paris
Paris on a Sunday
And the month is MayEmbed
