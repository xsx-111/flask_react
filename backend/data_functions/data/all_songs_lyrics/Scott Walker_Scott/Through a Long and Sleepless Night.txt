Through a Long and Sleepless Night LyricsThrough a long and sleepless night
I whisper your name
Through a long and sleepless night
Of who is to blame
Can't help but wonder
If you're lonely too
As I lie here and toss about
So at a loss without you
How I wish, my heart would leave
My memories alone
Why must I re-dream, re-live
The Joys we have known
I pray that someday
Our love will see the light
Till then
In tick-tock silence
I'll beg my heart to weep less
All through an oh so long and sleepless night
I pray that someday
Our love will see the light
Till then
In tick-tock silence
I'll beg my heart to weep less
All through an oh so long and sleepless night1Embed
