Angelica Lyrics
Each night I meant to say
I'd missed her through the day
But I'd forget it
I never said it
I passed the flower shop
Lord knows I meant to stop
But I'd say tomorrow
Perhaps tomorrow

Tomorrow there'd be time
There'd always be another spring
Time to make her laughter ring
Time to give her everything

Oh my Angelica, my Angelica
There's so much you never knew
So much I always meant to say
And do, for you, for you
Angelica

And then the cold winds came
And when I spoke her name
And felt her near me
She couldn't hear me
A shadow had been cast
Too many springs had passed
For Angelica
Sweet Angelica
Now in my solitude
I tend the flowers that I buy
As they slowly fade and die
Watered by the tears I cry

For my Angelica, my Angelica
There's so much you never knew
So much I always meant to say
And do, for you
For you

Angelica
Angelica
