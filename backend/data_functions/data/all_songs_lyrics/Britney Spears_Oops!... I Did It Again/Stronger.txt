Stronger Lyrics
Ooh, hey, yeah

Hush, just stop
There’s nothing you can do or say (Baby)
I've had enough
I'm not your property as from today (Baby)

You might think that I won't make it
On my own

But now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I, I'm stronger

Than I ever thought that I could be (Baby)
I used to go with the flow
Didn't really care 'bout me

You might think that I can't take it
But you're wrong
'Cause now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I, I'm stronger

Come on now
Oh, yeah

Here I go, on my own
I don't need nobody, better off alone
Here I go, on my own now
I don't need nobody, not anybody
Here I go (Here I go, here I go, here I go...)
Alright
(Here I go, here I go, here I go) Here I go

Stronger than yesterday
It’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I, I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
And I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more (No more)
(I'm) I, I'm stronger14Embed
