What U See (Is What U Get) Lyrics
You used to say that I was special
Everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much make-up
That my dress is too tight
You got no reasons to be jealous
I've never been untrue
So does it really matter if they're looking?
I'm only looking at you

You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am

What you see is what you get
This is me, hey, you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get

I know you watch me when I'm dancing
When I party with my friends
I can feel your eyes on my back, baby (Ah, na na)
I can't have no chains around me, baby, can't you see?
I could be anything you dream of, but I gotta feel free
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am

What you see is what you get
This is me, hey, you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get

You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
Believe me, you’ll be looking for trouble
If you hurt me
I can promise you, you’ll be looking for trouble
Believe me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What you see is what you get
This is me, hey, you
Oh, if you want me, don't forget
You should take (you should take) me as I am, yeah, yeah
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get
"Hey, what's up this is Brit
And I'm not in right now
So do your thang!
Beep! hehehe, I'm just kiddin'"
"Hehehe, yo Brit
You're a nerd, you really need to change that message
Look, I was thinking about that movie we saw the other night
You know, how she had all that fame, and all that money
And she still wasn't happy
Wouldn't that make a cool song?"8Embed
