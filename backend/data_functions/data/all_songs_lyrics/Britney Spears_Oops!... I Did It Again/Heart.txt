Heart Lyrics
Heart, I know I’ve been hard on you
I’m sorry for the things I’ve put you through
Before you start to break on me or ask for sympathy
I need to make you see
Oh, heart, I’m not sure it’s been long enough
To say that what I feel is really love
There’s just one way to learn, sometimes we’ll get hurt
And right now it’s our turn

Give it time, help me through
Heart, we can do this together
You’re my strength, you’re my soul
I need you now more than ever

Heart, all the hurt will soon be gone
If you’ll, if you’ll just keep on being strong
You will always be my friend, so keep on hanging in
And we’ll find love again

Give it time, help me through (help me)
Heart, we can do this together
You’re my strength, you’re my soul (my strength)
I need you now more than ever
Heart, I know I’ve been hard on you
I’m sorry for the things I put you through
Please don’t you break on me, I need to make you see
It wasn’t meant to be
'Cause you will always be my friend, so keep on hanging in
And we’ll find love again

"So Amanda, whatcha guys do on your date last night?"
"Oh he was so sweet. He took me to eat and brought me roses." (Aw..)
"And then we went back to his house and watched movies."
"You went back to his house?"
"Did you guys kiss?"
"I'm not telling you that!" (laughter)
"Oh my god, you did!"
"Shhh...oh my god."
"Look at that guy."
"He's so cute."
"And he's looking over here."
"Be quiet. Gotta be cool."
"Go talk to him."
"No...I'm too nervous."
"What would I say?"Embed
