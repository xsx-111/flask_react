You Got It All Lyrics
I, I was the game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came my way one night
Just one look and I knew

You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?

You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true
There's just you
You must have been Heaven sent
Hearing me call
You were out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all
Over him
All over
You've got it all over
All over
You've got it all over

No, don't let him worry you so
Once I met you, I let go
Oh, you can surely see
You're so much more to me
Just one look and I knew

You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the best? Yeah
Don't you know?
Don't you know?

You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true
There's just you
You must have been Heaven sent
Hearing me call
You were out on a limb (Out on a limb)
And you're all that he's not (All that he's not)
Just look what I've got (Look what I've got)
'Cause you've got it all (You've got it all)
Over him
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true (so true)
There's just you
You must have been Heaven sent
Hearing me call
You were out on a limb (Out on a limb)
And you're all that he's not (All that he's not)
Just look what I've got (Look what I've got)
'Cause you've got it all (You've got it all)
Over him
All over
You've got it all over
All over
You've got it all over him1Embed
