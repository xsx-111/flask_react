Lava Lamp Lyrics
Sometimes you have to let go
To free fall away
I won't judge you anymore
'Cause sometimes I needed to
Free fall far away
Out of sight, out of mind

I'm so tired
Where can I lay my head?
I'll just close my eyes
Hope I wake up dead
Don't want to live without you
Don't leave me out here to die

Maybe another time and space
When I can look you in the face
Far, far away
Maybe in another life5Embed
