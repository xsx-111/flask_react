Inferno Lyrics
Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead

Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness
Bright as day, dark as night
The inferno

Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead (that's right)

Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness
Bright as day, dark as night
The inferno

Welcome to the madness, madness
Leave your mind at the door, check out
Madness, madnessEmbed
