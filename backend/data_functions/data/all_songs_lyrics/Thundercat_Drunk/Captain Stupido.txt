Captain Stupido Lyrics
I feel weird
Comb your beard, brush your teeth
Still feel weird
Beat your meat, go to sleep

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I think I left my wallet at the club
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Jesus, take the wheel

I feel weird
Comb your beard, brush your teeth
Still feel weird
Beat your meat, go to sleep

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I think I left my wallet at the club
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Jesus, take the wheel
I feel weird
Comb your beard, brush your teeth
Still feel weird
Beat your meat, go to sleep

I think I left my wallet at the club3Embed
