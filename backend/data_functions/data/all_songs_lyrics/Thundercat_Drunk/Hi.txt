Hi Lyrics
Change anything
Love, death
As it should
Birth
As it should
Life
As it should
Death (death)
One more time, are you ready?

Perfection
Seduction, deception
Enough with the questions
Ooh, we running outta time, time, time

Heavy load
Watch it all unfold

You promised that you'd never die
Oh, how naive of me
I wish someone could tell me why
Why it's so hard to lie from your knees
I'm down to the bottom of the bottle
Say hello forever and goodbye tomorrow
Oh
Children of forever
Children of forever
Children of forever
That sound is so awesome
