White Man Lyrics
I'm a simple man
With a simple name
From this soil, my people came
In this soil remain
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

And we made us our shoes
And we trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand
Oh yeah

White man, white man
Don't you see the light
Behind your blackened skies
(White man, white man)
You took away the sights
To blind my simple eyes, yeah
(White man, white man)
Where you gonna hide
From the hell you've made?
Oh, the red man knows war
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies
Oh yeah

Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by every God's name
Say your prayers for your race
Oh yeah

(White man, white man)
Our country was green
And all our rivers wide
White man, white man
You came with a gun
And soon our children died
White man, white man
Don't you give a light
For the blood you've shed?
Uuuh yeah

Oh-uh-oh
(White man, white man)
White man
(White man, white man)
Ooh, white man
You fought your battle with lies, yeah
(White man, white man)
On and on, on and on
But we weren't too civilized, yeah
(White man, white man)
Look around you
Take a look around
Every skin and bone
Yeah, I'll getcha, I'll getcha, yeah

What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone
A man who learned how to teach
Then forgot how to learn
Oh yeah3Embed
