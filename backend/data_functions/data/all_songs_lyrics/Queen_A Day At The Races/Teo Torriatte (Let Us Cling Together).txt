Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together) Lyrics
When I'm gone
No need to wonder
If I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us
And time is but a paper moon
Be not gone

Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold
The flower that touches you
A new life grows, the blossom knows
There's no one else
Could warm my heart as much as you
Be not gone

Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned
Teo Torriate konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki
Hear my song
Still, think of me the way
You've come to think of me
The nights grow long
But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes
And you can be with me
Dream on

Teo Torriate konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki
When I'm gone
They'll say we're all fools
And we don't understand
Oh, be strong
Don't turn your heart
We're all, you're all
For all, for always
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned
