Drowse Lyrics
It's the sad-eyed goodbye
Yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street
Weak-kneed partings I recall

It's the mistier mist, the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays

There's all the more reason
For laughing and crying
When you're younger
And life isn't too hard at all

It's the fantastic drowse
Of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings
To waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years

It's a vertical hold
All the things that you're told
For the everyday hero
It all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason
For living or dying
When you're young
And your troubles are all very small

Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk
With endlessly restless feet
And half of the time
We'd broaden our minds more
In the pool hall than we did
In the school hall
With the downtown
Chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife
The lights and the fun

Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain’t easy for a smalltown boy
It ain’t easy at all
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached
For breakfast I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror
Now who else do I like?
