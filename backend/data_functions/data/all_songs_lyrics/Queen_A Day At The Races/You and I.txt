You and I Lyrics
Ooh-ooh

Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering, my heart's jittering
Just you and I
Not tonight, come tomorrow
When everything's sunny
And bright (sunny and bright)
No, no, no, come tomorrow
Cause then we'll be
Waiting for the moonlight

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight

Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay a while
Ooh, you know I never could
Foresee the future years
You know I never could see
Where life was leading me
But will we be together forever?
What will be my love?
Can't you see that I just don't know
Don't know


No, no, not tonight, come tomorrow
When everything's gonna
Be alright (sunny and bright)
Wait and see if tomorrow
Will be as happy
As we're feeling tonight

We'll go walking
In the moonlight (Oh, we'll be happy)
Walking in the moonlight

I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
Just you and I
Ooh, just you and I
Mm, just you and I
Can't you see that
We gotta be together, be together
Just you and I, just you and I
No more questions, just you and I5Embed
