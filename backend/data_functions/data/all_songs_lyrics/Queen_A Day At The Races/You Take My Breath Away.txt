You Take My Breath Away Lyrics
Ooh
Ooh, take it, take it all away
Ooh
Ooh, take my breath away (ooh)
Ooh
Ooh, you-ou-ou-ou
Take my breath away

Look into my eyes and you'll see
I'm the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart, changed my life
Every time you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside

You take my breath away
You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
(Please don't cry anymore)
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life
For just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away

So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you anywhere you go
I'll be right behind you (ooh)
Right until the ends of the earth (aah)
I'll get no sleep
Till I find you (get no sleep)
And tell you that you just

Take my breath away

I will find you anywhere you go (ooh)
Right until the ends of the earth (aah)
I'll get no sleep
Till I find you (get no sleep)
To tell you when I've found you
I love you
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath away
Ooh, take my breath away
Ooh, take my breath away
Ooh, take my breath away8Embed
