Whammy Kiss LyricsI need a refueling
I need your kiss
Come on now and
Plant it on my lips
Whammy kiss me
Whammy hug
Revitalize me
Give me whammy love
Yeah!
On Planet X-oh it
Won't be long now
I got a light year to
Get to the phone now
I'm gonna contact you
When I get home
Give it all you got
Give it all to me
Come on mammy and
Throw me that whammy
I said give it all you got
Give it all to me
Come on mammy, throw
Me that whammy
And I know I need
That whammy kiss
Whatever you do
I'm just passing the
Time to get to you
To pass the time with you
He cannot stand to
Go into work when he
Needs some whammy love
Whammy
You gotta use it right
Use it right now
I ain't foolin'
Give me a refuelin'
Yeah, whammy kiss me
Whammy hug
Come on mammy throw
Me that whammyEmbed
