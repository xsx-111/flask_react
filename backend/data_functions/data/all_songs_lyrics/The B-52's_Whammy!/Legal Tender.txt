Legal Tender LyricsWe're in the basement
Learning to print, all of it's hot
10-20-30 million ready to be spent
We're stackin' 'em against the wall
Those gangster presidents
Livin' simple and trying to get by
But honey, prices have shot through the sky
So I fixed up the basement with what I was a-workin' with
Stocked it full of jelly jars and heavy equipment
We're in the basement
10-20-30 million dollars, ready to be spent
Walk into the bank, try to pass that trash
Teller sees and says, "Uh-huh, that's fresh as grass"
See the street pass under your feet
In time to buy the latest model getaway Jeep
So I fixed up the basement
With what I was a-workin' with
Stocked it full of jelly jars and heavy equipment
We're in the basement
So I fixed up the basement
With what I was a-workin' with
Stocked it full of jelly jars and heavy equipment
We're in the basement
Learning to print, all of it's hot, all counterfeitEmbed
