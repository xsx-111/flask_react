Big Bird LyricsThere's a big bird over my house
Go away, go away
There's a big bird flying over my house
And it looks like it's decided to stay
It's making a mistake...a big mistake
Big bird
Big bird
Big bird
Big bird
I pinch myself
I think I'm not dreamng
I'm not
I hear screaming!
C'mon! Get it out now
Wants to use me to feather its nest
Now it wants the rest
It's swooping from the branch
It's swooping from the sky
Spreadin' its feathers
Cuttin' out-flying
There's a big gray bird flying over my house
What do you think I am?
I'm not a louse!
There's a big bird over my house
There's a big, big, big bird
Over my house
What's it doing?
What does it want?
I pinch myself
I think I'm dreaming
I'm not...I hear screaming!
C'mon! Let it out now
Wants to use me to feather its nest
Now it wants the rest
It's swooping from the branch
Swooping from the sky
Spreadin' its feathers
Cuttin' out-flying
There's a big gray bird circling
'Round my house
Circling 'round and 'round
Circling 'round my house
There's a big bird over my house
There's a big, big, big bird
Over my houseEmbed
