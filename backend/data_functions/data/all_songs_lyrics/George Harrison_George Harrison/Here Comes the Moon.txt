Here Comes the Moon Lyrics
Everybody's talking up a storm
Act like they don't noticed it
But here it is and here it comes

Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Oh yeah

Impulse always quickens when it's full
As it turns my head around me
Yes it does, and here it comes

Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Oh yeah

God's gift I see that's moving up there into the night
Though dark, the mirror in the sky reflects us our light

Looks like a little brother to the sun
Or mother to the stars at night
And here it is and here it comes
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Oh yeah

Breath is always taken when it's new
Enhance upon the clouds around it
Yes it is, and here it comes

Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Oh yeahEmbed
