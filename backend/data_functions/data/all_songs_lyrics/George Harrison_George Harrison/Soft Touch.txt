Soft Touch Lyrics
You're a soft touch baby like a snowflake falling
My whole heart is melting
As a warm sun rises into joy I'm sailing
To your soft touch baby

Eyes that shine from depths of your soul
Fixed by their charm, take my control
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide
Caught by your waves and drawn to your side

As a cool wind blows me all the treetops whisper
To your soft touch baby
As a new moon rises those ideas of heaven
Fall in your soft touch baby

Eyes that shine from depths of your soul
Fixed by their charm, take my control
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide
Caught by your waves and drawn to your side

You're a soft touch baby like a snowflake falling
My whole heart is melting
As a warm sun rises into joy I'm sailing
To your soft touch baby
You're a soft touch baby
Yes I love that soft touch
That soft touch
You're a soft touch baby
Yes I love that soft touchEmbed
