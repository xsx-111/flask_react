Blow Away Lyrics
Day turned black, sky ripped apart
Rained for a year 'til it dampened my heart
Cracks and the leaks, the floorboards caught rot
About to go down, I had almost forgot

All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away

Sky cleared up, day turned to bright
Closing both eyes now the head filled with light
Hard to remember what a state I was in
Instant amnesia
Yang to the Yin

All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
Wind blew in, cloud was dispersed
Rainbows appearing, the pressures were burst
Breezes a-singing, now feeling good
The moment had passed like I knew that it should

All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away

All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away7Embed
