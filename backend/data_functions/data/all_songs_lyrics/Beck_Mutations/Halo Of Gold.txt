Halo Of Gold Lyrics
Have you got a fine place to slip to
When you're feeling down?
Have you had a week or two
Just to get your troubles down?
Found a lot of life and laughter
With a grandfather in the bowery
She had a body of sixteen or seventeen
She had a mind of forty
I met her on a cold day
In a city far away
With the worlds about zero
And I saw at once
Into her soul
She's bound to call me her hero
Then like a walk in the rain or the lane
I found a lot of death that day
With the grandfather in the bowery
Cause I like her like the world
She had a halo of gold
Told me stories of her life
And the courage was sublime
Cause you're mine
I walk the line
Cause you're mine
I walk the line1Embed
