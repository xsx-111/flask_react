Sing It Again Lyrics
Should we do another one then?
(Damn right!)
Let's go
(I, 2, 3, 4,)

A town of disrespect
The trains are wrecked
The night is younger then us
Nowhere is anywhere else
You keep to yourself
Stirring the dregs where I have laid

The exit signs are flashing
Dead ends, they won't come to life anymore

I pledge the rest
I should have guessed
Your love was hanging by threads
Tongues tied under the moon
My love is a room
Of broken bottles and tangled webs
The misers wind their minds
Like clocks that grind their gears, on and on

And if it's meant, some accident
Some coincidence
Crumbs fall out of the sky
When you wander by
The dust clouds blow and nobody's home

Oh won't you lay my bags
Upon on the funeral fire and sing it again

Oh won't you lay my bags
Upon on the funeral fire and sing it again1Embed
