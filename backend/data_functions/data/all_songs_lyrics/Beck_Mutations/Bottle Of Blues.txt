Bottle Of Blues Lyrics
I just found me a bottle of blues
Some strange comfort for a soul to soothe
Ain't it hard
Ain't it hard
To want somebody who doesn't want you
And I've been waiting for a year, a day
Some strange weather must be blowing my way
Cause I got no mind to go or to stay
Or be left behind

Holding hands with an impotent dream
In a brothel of fake energy
Put a nickel in the graveyard machine
I get higher and lower
I get higher and lower
Like a tired soldier
With nothing' to shoot
And nowhere to lose
This bottle of blues

Egos drone
And pose alone
Like black balloons
All banged and blown
On a backwoods river
The infidels shiver
In the stench of belief
And tell my momma I'm a hundred years late
I'm over the rails
And out of the race
And the crippled psalms
Of an age that won't thaw
Are ringing in my ears
Holding' hands with an impotent dream
In a brothel of fake energy
Put a nickel in the graveyard machine
I get higher and lower
I get higher and lower
Like a tired soldier
With nothing to shoot
And nowhere to lose this
Bottle of blues

Well I just found me a bottle of blues
Some strange comfort for a soul to soothe
Ain't it hard, ain't it hard
To want somebody who doesn't want you

Holding' hands with an impotent dream
In a brothel of fake energy
Put a nickel in the graveyard machine
I get higher and lower
I get higher and lower
Like a tired soldier
With nothing to shoot
And nowhere to lose this
Bottle of blues
