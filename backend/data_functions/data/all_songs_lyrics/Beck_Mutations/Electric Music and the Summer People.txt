Electric Music and the Summer People Lyrics
Out on the highway, I'm doing it my way
Handing out money, the flies making honey
Zigzag patients, vibrating the ancients
Beaches aplenty, the pigs on the levee

Let's don't be like everyone else
With the one trip rooms and the halfway house
Big black drums beating the night
Running away
That's what I like

Seasons are turning, villages burning
Convalescents open their presents
Wandering children ready and willing
Beggars and lightweights harness the highways

Let's don't be like everyone else
With the one trip rooms and the halfway house
Big black drums beating the night
Running away
That's what I like
Abandoned coal mines, we'll have a good time
Sunstroke rivals recycling bibles

Let's don't be like everyone else
With the one trip rooms and the halfway house
Big black drums beating the night
Running away
That's what I likeEmbed
