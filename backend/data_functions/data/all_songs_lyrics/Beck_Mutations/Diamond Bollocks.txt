Diamond Bollocks Lyrics

Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
Offices and fountains that they named for you
Dazzlements of accidents rejoice their doom
Harikaris spinning round the golden looms
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Girl, you dream infections from a nauseous heart
Choice cut meats from derelict boulevards


Hear that lonesome whistle blow
No direction to be known in a senile revelry
A tearful gaze turns away, emoting cold and gray
Scented eunuchs clothe our wretchedness


(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
Offices and fountains that they named for you
So ungrateful to the who's and what's-his-face
Terrorist confections look so out of place
Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
