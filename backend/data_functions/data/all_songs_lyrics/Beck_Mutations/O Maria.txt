O Maria Lyrics
There was no one, nothing to see
The night is useless and so are we
'Cause everybody knows the fabric of folly
Is falling apart at the seams

And I've been looking for a good time
But the pleasures are seldom and few

There's no whiskey, there's no wine
Just the concrete and a worried mind
Cause everyone knows death creeps in slow
'Til you feel safe in his arms

And I've been looking for a new friend
And I don't care if he's decrepit and gray

O Maria haven't you known
Days so careless all on your own
'Cause everybody knows the circus is closed
And the animals have gone wild
And I've been looking for my shadow
But this place is so bright and so clean

There was no one, nothing to see
The night is useless and so are we
'Cause everybody knows the fabric of folly
Is falling apart at the seams

And I've been looking for a good time
But the pleasures are seldom and few2Embed
