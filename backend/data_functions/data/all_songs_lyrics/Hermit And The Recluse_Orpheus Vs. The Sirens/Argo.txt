Argo Lyrics
It’s perilous and all our men shall need courage
For you see, for years we wanted an opportunity
And now we know the adventure for which Argo’s ship was destined
It’s the Hermit and the Recluse
One sermon, one produce

From bummy to one hundred money sown in pocket
Flow aquatic, known alone for my slow hypnotic
Though some fault and throw salt, kept a low systolic
Toast with five holsters from live culture, probiotic
My darts hit the mark on target, never overshot it
Infinite temperament, if mentioned it, know I got it
They tasked to play wit’ you, I’m on a path past aspirational
Hope you saving data, we labelled the craft and create for you
Where clips devour scripts of power, this what I was made to do
That steady feeling straight to you?
Ready, willing, capable
Appears rain hits, couldn’t get a miss, thirst was insatiable
Bowed and vowed to my mythology, put my faith in you
(Our father, who art in heaven
Hollows, hollows)

Mourned and cried on the wrong side of the hardest track
Discover they supply you lies, I'm more artifact
I might touch illustrious, even though I started whack
Mind you a smarter rap what I rhyme for my cardiac
Spoke for grimy, hope you find me timely, when you need it
They rappers bad for the hatchlings, I'm tryna supersede it
What stalked this lion, brought the iron, they was too anemic
Was ripe to fall, see writing on the wall, (few could read it)
My discretionary tales, for some unnecessary
For some irrelevant
The people love me deeply ‘cause I speak that ugly elegant
True what I do is hood intel, intelligent
Ain’t bold enough to hold your gold? Then aye, you out your element
If what you provide is not inspiring, I’m not amused
What word hurt me, Euterpe was the 9 I used
Hope you pick appropriate when it's your time to choose
Our boys hard as Spartans, if not trying hardest you try and lose
A trial where violence, begot violence, hate begot hate
They now surmising surviving all that, we got great
For pennies, many in the night icing, try and stack cake
The morgue was reward if they draw, and you react late
Won't peep weakness though my scars show
Disappear in history or be hero on that Argo
Some bail, set sail every hard blow
I'd rather stand, be the man, the Gods know
Won't peep weakness though my scars show
Disappear in history or be hero on that Argo
Some bail, set sail every hard blow
I'd rather stand, be the man, the Gods know
The Gods know
