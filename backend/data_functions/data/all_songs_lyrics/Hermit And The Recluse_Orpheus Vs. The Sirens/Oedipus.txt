Oedipus Lyrics"And it was an ill thing"

Can't relate
Apparently we ain't family, you can't relate
Apparently we ain't family, you can't relate

I'm ill prepared, stupid ready
My tale on tape, super heavy
I been felled at welter and bantamweight
Apparently we ain't family, you can't relate
(What's good brother? How you doing sister, I mean you good?)
Death prompts the scene, while my conscience clean, no regret
Get hands on Canons for your picture, you could pose a threat
Boundary seas by the town thieves, don't overstep
Value some of your health? Humble yourself, show respect
Beef ignited, we felt the least bit slighted we chose the rep
These clones around me hunting for a bounty like Boba Fett
The worst evaded perpetrators are the ones you don't suspect
To never get crossed by gift horse like when the Trojans slept

I'm ill prepared
Apparently we ain't family, you can't relate
In brownbill, I speak the shit that got my man killed
Play a song, get hated on by those who can't stand real
Couldn't sit calm, they sitcom and flick on some spoke news
Across the board, if I'm forced to draw, we both lose
On his block he's clocking alarming numbers, don't snooze
I broke the rules with motives, stole the show left no clues
From house of foreign cars, sorta ours, learn to ball and dodge
All the righteous brothers reciting nuggets, we call them gods
I'm tryin' to use my talents to tell, to balance my scale
Shit was rigid, only visit to the island was jail, arrived to Riker's
With moms from diapers
The price to survive them long nights was
A heavy told grave, thoughts buried up in every soul
The warm-heart tender beings end up being very cold
(End up being very cold)

Apparently we ain't family, you can't relate

Some need battery in they back
Almost perpetual
Padded pockets as erratic novice, now smooth professional
Won't die in battle, mommy dipped me in that river styx
When the sucker tried to rupture my Achilles, I didn't miss
The home we grace, only place ignorance isn't bliss
A crapshoot for KA, 'cause every night two die, get the gist?
"Unfortunates" is what they called us 'cause our fortunes at birth
It's clear I greet the air sweet, I'm the salt to the earth
I'm ill prepared
(I'm ill prepared)
Apparently we ain't family, you can't relate

A horseless knight, taught to fight, wasn't taught to squeeze
Its better known to hear they never bolted like Portuguese
The girls that shared it with the world, when they caught disease
Who suppose the goons get told soon as they got caught with kis
I fashion less crimes with passion, more crimes with treason
You find enough time then just rhyme, I rhyme for reason
I admit they got some hits
(I admit, got some hits)
That's jus' why Im here bobb' and weaving

I'm ill-prepared
Apparently, we ain't family, they can't relate
I'm ill-prepared
Apparently, we ain't family, they can't relate
I'm ill-prepared
Apparently, we ain't family, they can't relate
I'm ill-prepared
Apparently, we ain't family, they can't relate
I'm ill-prepared
Apparently, we ain't family, they can't relate
I'm ill-prepared
Apparently, we ain't family, they can't relate
I'm ill-prepared
Apparently, we ain't family, they can't relate
You got the wrong genes
Not on, in
Yeah, see the problem is
There's no G in your genes
You don't understand it because it doesn't have nothin' to do with you
I get it
I don't understand sucka' shit
I don't understand sucka' shit
Can't understand this
You not family
We can't relateEmbed
