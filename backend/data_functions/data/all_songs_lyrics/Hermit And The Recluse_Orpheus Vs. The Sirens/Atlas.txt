Atlas Lyrics
I have sung storms to sleep
I have made the crashing rocks move away from our ship
I have been to the end of the world and seen things more terrible, more beautiful than I thought could be

Around the Atlas got respect
Weight of the world on my shoulders ain't drop it yet
Got respect
Weight of the world on my shoulders ain't drop it yet

The hardest hitters was the father figures
Praying you learn from they burn was all scarred with triggers
Put knife to that piece of the pie to carve the biggest
'Fore you call a feast, dodge all police charged to get us
Many tours locked at war won't be troubled by a witch hunt
Calm ones incited to palm jums or fist pump
Decided quiet but desire what the rich want
Torn steadily, longevity or a quick stunt?
Bless you nephew, don't want you doing what I did
Get honest earnin' instead of what I was learning in a locked crib
Decades dormant then recorded what bothered me
My media encyclopedia, they more of a novelty
My media encyclopedia, they more of a novelty
They say it is a gift of the gods
Has the power to heal, bring peace, rid the land of plague and famine
Then it would inspire the people, wipe out the years of misrule
They would know the gods have not abandoned them

I want peace each death left the crew in tears
Committed living in these hard bars, I'm doing years
Appears they not peers what they doing weak
How it's lookin', Brooklyn birth Gods like they do in Crete
Respected, because protected the hood when you was sleep
My duty, did something daily could've got me in Juvy
Did more then allowed of me, proud of me if you knew me
It was picked apart by wicked dark, planned the demise
Point and bang, didn't join a gang my family was live
From birth too down to earth, ain't a fan of disguise
To me it's vogue being rogue when the standard is lies
Left the field, dressed to kill, nothing I wore peaceful
Most these fucks is ducks, don't let em all geese you
Hemorrhaging for the genuine never side with the fake
In my end days pray I save more lives than I take
I pray I save more lives than I take
Listen to what I have to say
What I've done is for you
Carve a dozen bars harder than the 12 labours
By twelve, hated for heaven's sakes for how hell made us
Kept pacing and raised basically for my finished lines
Pray my father's harvest not bothered for the sins that's mines

Got respect
Weight of the world on my shoulders ain't drop it yet
Around the Atlas got respect
Weight of the world on my shoulders ain't drop it yet2Embed
