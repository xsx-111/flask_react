Companion of Artemis Lyrics
You either hunter or the prey
Hunters prey on you today

Graft quotes burden is of heard em the last hope
Armed with alarm and bars that keep the craft woke
I bounce the pen, I council men cast vote
Watch em flock for riches even though my staff broke
Came through, remained true was a side-vow
Understood in the lowest form where we born hostile
Place where I lecture, steps should be graced with a scepter
The thirst search me for safe taste of the nectar
Glance over notice of a prose of ambrosia
Raps of wisdom, not acquisition, we stand polar
Stuff we're making suffocating like a grand boa
I'm in the lab, snapping that jab your hand slower
Obviously to make moms proud of me stayed in college
Thought it may have bought her some slave quarters to trade to dollars
Never passed for trash even though I came from garbage
From pain to solace with all my stains polished
My structure's global - our landlines are subbed with mobile
On the strength is my attempt to lament something noble

You either hunter or the prey
Pray you a hunter 'fore hunters prey on you today
My task repping, this man shit, vas deferens (vas deferens)
Don't let it pass it might be the last lesson
Hard prior on car tire, where I stash weapon
We don't call fears or prayers in a blink fast blessings
My aggression’s subdued since in the presence of food
On the right side of a bottle, the heavens approve
Dreamed laid a clean slate, pray the wraiths don’t dash mine
Through loss learned to say it’s goodbye like it’s the last time
From Athena everything seemed greener but the grass fine
If inefficient for linguistic cinema, I cast line
Shine don't let another define what you become
Finna win against a hundred fake when you the truest one
In a wake at no cake the young pursue the crumb
So peace to that retired cop who never drew his gun
He did 'cause knew a good career was never shoot a son
So son, put feelings in your dealings, never do it numb
(Put feelings in your dealings never do it numb)

You either hunter or the prey
Pray you a hunter for hunters prey on you today
You either hunter or the prey
Pray you the hunter for hunters prey on you todayEmbed
