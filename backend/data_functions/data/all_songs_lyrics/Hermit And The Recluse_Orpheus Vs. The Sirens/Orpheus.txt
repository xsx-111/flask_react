Orpheus Lyrics
Orpheus!
Let's have a song!

Block norm we form we fight
Not knowing who wrong who right
But reason don’t warn with might
Still squeezing, let it palm the sight
Still breathing, come with armor tight
Still grieving, another song to write

One day they gon get me but one day ain't tonight
One day they gon get me but one day ain't tonight
One day they gon get me but one day ain't tonight
One day ain't tonight

For many moons too goon to take advice
Way I was moving knew I'd soon take a life
Fight engaged no righteous days and sacred nights
Stakes is high let a couple 8ths fly then raise the price
Devastation laced in my presentation
Pack pound won’t back down whatever facing
Judging from my cover each chapters a revelation
Might seem dusty but team trust me it's celebration
Now I shine but in times paler from the failure
They trot things but Ka seems rarer I'm a tailor
Swams mudded find a land lover who the sailor
See I was sick never boarded only courted like a jailor
Grab 500 on my ave can’t be semi G
This tainted math ain't a class at MIT
On my dean supreme be seen no men I plea
Potent topic Spoken pocket on the m-i-c
(Spoken pocket on the m-i-c, what?)
As far as competitors there never was
Hyperdrive since I survived Beretta slugs
Knowledge lasts for powders craft no better love
Bonafide the beef only hiding a leather glove
Dumb brass, was running with the guns unmasked
Talk shit and get cops we lick shots for tonguelash
As quiet as it's kept the lines are select
You caught for raw I'm supplying a connect
From damn became a man they admire and respect
Topspin once popped in won’t require an inject
So much killing even when building we brung a tool
Mentally jogging my memory is the only way I run a jewel
My sense is true in principle I could run a school
From impoverished home I got it sewn I spun a spool
Tumultuous cope with shit fitting the con rap
In this landscape handshake is a contract
If thats broken blacks back match smoking
Only herds lobby for 3rd parties that's facts spoken
(That's facts spoken)

They hold a grudge for my melanin
On the strength of my dubs, I get love as a skeleton
My crust wasn’t upper, so a sucker I never been
The good said it I'm hood medic rushing you medicine
I'm addressing the order about the times I pestle and mortar
A bunch of men jumping in no testing the water
To raise a quarter played the corner, no better look
Yes fella was bestseller before I read a book
When heard emotions is stirred was never shook
Had to wait didn’t marinate let it cook all seasons
More war, more grievance
Taught a chef impression that'll question your allegiance
Can you rep it if it's separate from your credence?
Come relax with the gods instead of flexing with the heathens
Block norm we form we fight
Not knowing who wrong who right
But reason don’t warn with might
Still squeezing let it palm the sight
Still breathing come with armour tight
Still grieving another song to write

One day they gon get me but one day ain't tonight
One day they gon get me but one day ain't tonight
One day they gon get me but one day ain't tonight
One day ain't tonight
One day ain't tonightEmbed
