Sirens Lyrics

Oh, don't stop. Play on, please

There's a price, a place on your ship

What do you know of the sea?

Nothing

To face the sea without knowledge or skill brings only death

Of death I am knowledgeable
Danger I do not fear and I can give you music
Music that will tame wild beasts, lift men's hearts to heaven

What is your name?

Orpheus
(The Sirens, The Sirens, The Sirens)
(The Sirens, The Sirens, The Sirens)

I think it's fine to relinquish mine for the life of our seeds
From the weak moves these dudes eat your food like harpies
Not just car thieves, large pleas, came home hardened murderers
By the death toll, would've thought the threshold was guarded by Cerberus
It's hard to love, and if only God could judge, who needs juries?
Weighin' the crime, still payin' for mine, haunted by the Three Furies
Should discover y'all brothers instead of throwin' signs that divide you
It ain't never shoot you, just headed to you with nines
It's the Hydra
Being deprived of the papes made a lot of mistakes in my era
Hard life, course you needed white horse to defeat the Chimera
Every morning wake, never caught a break, revealed I was jinxed
To be the man deciphers life's riddle or get killed by the Sphinx
Quietly spoke volume of my drama, since then I've been at war
It's no bull, my lab was in a labyrinth like the Minotaur
Rose from the pavement unaided, negotiated like the sly fox
I told son, won't be fooled by no one, like the Cyclops
The more static, the more tatted, you would've thought yakuza
Large crops or hard rocks, it's like we all saw Medusa
Till the roar of the silence, we at war with the tyrants
Blocks of outlaws, but all we watch out for is the Sirens
(I'm not gon' let, let you)
(Get the best of, you get the best of me)

This is Orpheus' verse
This wasn't a want, it was more of a thirst
Brand last, 'cause on this land mass fortunate first
Of course when I was lost it was important to search
Questionable, 'cause at most impressionable they told me the worst
For years accepted this living prison, just thought we was cursed
If mommy couldn't buy me nothing, why she bore me to earth?
All this uncertainty was hurtin me, I fought it from birth
I'm here writing this priceless, they just reportin' they worth
(They just reportin' they worth)7Embed
