Hades Lyrics
I just want y’all to feel the strength
Number strength
I just wanna give you the best I can give you
"Everything must die Orpheus..."

What doesn’t kill you only make you ‘liver
Them years underweight, knew I make a great provider
The hardest lust was "In God We Trust," but faith in nada
With guns known for blazin', young only praisin that sacred dollar
Villainous, fired on all cylinders, vital times
To stay round devil playground, couldn’t idle minds
Heard me parley, even with dirty body, had a fly spirit
Only wan' hear facts. Where's at? How I get it

My gift genetic, if I penned it and said it, I meant it
Some friends fought attempts with tempests couldn't be tempered
Supposed to lose
Those old moves broke the rules or bent it
Word to mama, drama had to run its course, couldn’t prevent it
There’s no strength on the fence, start takin’ sides
Losing our kings to beautiful things that lead they demise
Due to my 'Ville make-up, still wake up every day surprised
My eyes open motion no longer hopin’ that my paper rise
Mind you what I’m tryna do, bring pride to the gutter
The times ripe to shine light, just might widen your shutter
Uttered a scream, in 2015, said bye to my brother
On sight I might look pristine, but still tryna recover
Might not ever (rest in peace Kev)
Recoup from that shit (love you forever)
Never (that'll never, never stop man)

There’s purity in obscurity, a glory I'll never bask
Cravin', savorin' good times showin' signs they never last
Comin' to summon great, is how I undertake every task
I'm relevant global, my element’s noble, they just heavy gas
Fuck the fake deep, save sheep, it’s the shepherd’s pay
Rap for the streets, master my piece, to step away
The heat stayed in the kitchen, whippin' up a étouffée
If you ain’t akhs, you better change spots, this where the lepers stay
A thou' won’t proud, there’s mouths to feed
Essentially once empty bellies are full, the house is greed
Between you and me, every knock ain't opportunity
I hate the maybes, so wake the ladies and take the babies
In case it's Hades

Stay down, but make the crime
We'll get up, if dates align
This carry weight, I'll take the time
What goes around, comes around
And breaks for mine
Was fit to dish it out, won't feel return
Just need our share, didn't care if it burned, 'das clear
When geared to earn, block shot up
Not appeared concernedEmbed
