Golden Fleece Lyrics
The poets will write about this in all the years to come
How we found the fleece of gold, or disappeared in the silence beneath us

Roam the streets, not known for peace
Never rest, forever quest, Golden Fleece
Golden Fleece
(The Argonauts)

The space on how we place, like Earth to stars, choose wise, decides it's titans versus the gods
Where I grew, no good, no hood worse then ours
Times had to let it pop, so they don’t hurt your moms
Overtly noted, there was no one off limits
For in (foreign) a meeting of the minds, try and record the minutes
I lay a page for later stage, they more for beginners
Never tight grab, white flag, war till it’s finished
Few winners, fewer dinners
May attitude to feed us
Each night, we keep fighting, didn’t matter if you beat us
No man programmed for building, they’d rather you delete us
Seems the half of you that hate us is the half of you that need us
(Seems the half of you that hate us is the half of you that need us)
I want compassion from the highest
Food for the lowest
Cures for the afflicted
Rooves for the homeless
Direction for the misled
Heat for the coldest
Love for the lonely
Peace for the soldiers
Romans feast, not known for peace
Never rest, forever quest, Golden Fleece
Never rest, forever quest, Golden Fleece

Acquire some skills in the height of the ‘ville
The rest were innate
Knew some crews who only left funerals in they wake
No one explained when my sister came, meant less on my plate
For years boxed in my options, less than the fate
If love is the message, then the message was late
'Cause by and large buying firearms, investing in hate
Was born where a wrong turn on this difficult pavement
Can be the difference if you live in riches or a vagrant
All fight this poor righteous, only wicked get the payment
And listen, you’re amiss if you think this is entertainment

Not known for peace
Golden Fleece
Roam the streets, not known for peace
Never rest, forever quest, Golden Fleece
Never rest
Forever quest
Golden Fleece
