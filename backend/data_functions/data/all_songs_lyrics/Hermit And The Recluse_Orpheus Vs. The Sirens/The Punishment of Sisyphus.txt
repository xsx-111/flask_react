The Punishment of Sisyphus Lyrics
Inherited a ready-made plight
Was too heavy, not many made light
Come from regal people, fell from great height
To track back to royal, had to break night

Feeding my pride humbly
Dreams that I die hungry
Did well not to fell, could tell seeds relied on me
Relied on me

They comme ci, comme Ã§a
Want a world of superlatives? Come see Ka
Stay hopeful and broke through on my umpteenth try-
To warn, you being watched by the unseen eye
Off innovation often mistaken as Orpheus
That man sing that he ran thing but couldn't walk with us

Explain how I'm 'posed to be tame when came from wild homes
Every inch of my coarse course didn't garner no milestones
Those in fashion raps with passion like hostile poems
Walked by buildings of crack, could've been tracked by Dow Jones
Move quiet, so admired when tools fire loud tones
There's boys to avoid getting knocked down stockpiled chromes
If a thug dumps, I sprung, tell my loved ones "get behind me"
Can find me with laws lost and Raw's cloth designed me
Born growing show that calm my moms envisioned
Fought against multiple shorts, should've been doing long division
Me and homie lost if the only course we on collision
War with foes, felt we always chose the wrong decision
Holding torch was shows of force, never resolution
All my days hadn't pulled it in from the tensions I never using
'Cause weighing the pain still playing the game forever losing
Apparently broke me, family wrote me from jail, the letters moving
Proven 'cause the letters made me treasure my free
Chased by 73rd since first steps in '73
Talk is of court, never fought, it's better to plea
Still conditioned to go on missions whatever it be
Learned many lessons from women, the biggest was forgiveness
Impossibly generosity taught me giving is the privilege
Thought for respect, had to be the villain of the village
'Cause the only ones chillin' was the ones willing to pillage
Armed for strong-arm and too impatient to plan a heist
And how you handle fights determine if you man or mice
But soon taught this ain't true sport if you a fan of life
Start to gather what you rather: six feet or get hand a vice
I choose the op to excuse a lot, just don't deceive me
Not at all spoiled if the hard-boiled never got over-easy
Where it's clear it's never acceptable to turn to jakes
I impress to you, become a vegetable or learn the stakes

Feeding my pride humbly
Dreams that I die hungry
Did well not to fell, could tell seeds relied on me
Relied on meEmbed
