The Long and Winding Road (Live) Lyrics
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before; don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door

The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Don't keep me waiting here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me standing here
Lead me to you door

But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
