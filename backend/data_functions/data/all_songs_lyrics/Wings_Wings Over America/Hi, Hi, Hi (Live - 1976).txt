Hi, Hi, Hi (Live / 1976) Lyrics
Well, when I met you at the station
You were standing with a bootleg in your hand
I took you back to my little place
For a taste of a multicolored band
We're gonna get high, high, high
The night is young
She’ll be my funky little mama
Gonna rock it, and we've only just begun

We're gonna get hi, hi, hi
With the music on
We won't say bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
'Til the night has gone
I'm gonna do it to you, gonna do you sweet banana
You've never been done
We're gonna get hi, hi, hi
In the midday sun
Whoah, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh

Well, well, take off your face
Recover from the trip you've been on
I want you to lie on the bed
Get you ready for my polygon
I'm gonna do it to you, gonna do you sweet banana
Cause you never got done
Yes, and like a rabbit, gonna grab it
I'm going to do it till the night is done baby
We're gonna get hi, hi, hi
With the music on
We won't say bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
'Til the night has gone
I'm gonna do it to you, gonna do you sweet banana
You've never been done
We're gonna get hi, hi, hi
We've got to get hi, hi, hi
We've got to get hi, hi, hi
In the midday sun

Ooh, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh
Hi, hi, hi
Hi, hi, hi
Hi, hi
In the midday sunEmbed
