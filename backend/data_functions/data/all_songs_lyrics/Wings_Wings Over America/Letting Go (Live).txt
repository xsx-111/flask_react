Letting Go (Live) Lyrics
Ah, she tastes like wine
Such a human being so divine
Oh, she feels like sun
Mother Nature look at what you've done

Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go
Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go

Oh, she looks like snow
I wanna put her in a Broadway show
Ah, she’ll dance and dine
Like a Lucifer she'll always shine

Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go
Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go
Oh, oh, I feel like letting go
Oh (Oh) I feel like letting go

Oh, she sings it so
I want to put her on the radio
One day and there you are
Ladies and gentleman
A brand new star
Oh, I feel like letting go
Oh, I feel like letting go
Do you feel like letting go?
Do you feel like letting go?
Do you feel like letting go?
Do you feel like letting go?Embed
