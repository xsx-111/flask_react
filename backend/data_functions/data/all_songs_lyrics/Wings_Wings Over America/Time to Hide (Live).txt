Time to Hide (Live) Lyrics
If I have to run, I'm not running out on you
If I have to shake a little sand out of my shoes
I'm runnin' from the law, or they'll put me inside

Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide?
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide?

I've been on the run since the Good Lord knows when
And the day I die, I'll still be running then
Runnin' from the times when I would lay me down and cry

Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide?
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide?

Will I love you tomorrow?
Yes, I will, my love
Oh yes I will, my love
Will I beg, steal or borrow?
Yes, I will, my love
Oh yes I will, my love
To spend a little time happy to be by your side
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide
If I have to run, I'm not running out on you
If I have to shake a little sand out of my shoes
I'm runnin' from the law, or they'll put me inside

Baby, won't you let me have a little time
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hideEmbed
