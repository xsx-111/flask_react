Richard Cory (Live) Lyrics
They say that Richard Cory owns one half of this whole town
With political connections to spread his wealth around
He was born into society, a banker's only child
He had everything a man could want: money, grace, and style

The papers print his picture almost every place he goes
Richard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at a show
And the rumor of his parties and the orgies on his yacht!
He really must be happy with everything he's got

But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be
Oh, I wish that I could be
Oh, I wish that I could be
John Denver

He really gave to the charities, he had the common touch
And they were thankful for his patronage and thank you very much
So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read
Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head
But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
I wish that I could be
I wish that I could be
Oh, I wish that I could be
