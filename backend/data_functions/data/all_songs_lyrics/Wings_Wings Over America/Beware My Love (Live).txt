Beware My Love (Live) LyricsWhoa whoa whoa, no no no!
I must be wrong, baby, yeah
But I don't believe, that he's the one
But if you insist, I must be wrong
(I must be wrong!)
I have to leave, and when I'm gone
I'll leave my message in my song
Beware my love, well he'll bowl you over
Beware my love, before you're much older
He's gonna sweep you up under his carpet
You'd be in luck if you could stop it
(Come on now)
Beware my love
He's gonna wear you out, and in a minute
You'll hear a shout, and then you'll be in it
So beware my love, 'cause he's gonna take you under
Beware, my love, the sound of his thunder
(Yeah!)
I don't believe that he's the one
But if you insist, I must be wrong
(I must be wrong)
But I have to leave, and when I'm gone
I'll leave my message in my song
(That's where I'm gonna leave it, baby
Come on)
Beware, my love, don't you know he'll bowl you over
Beware, my love before you're much older
He's gonna, he's gonna wear you out
When in a minute, you're gonna hear a shout
And then you'll be in it
(Baby gonna be there
Ow, beware
Yeah I'll be there
Oh, baby, beware
Beware, beware, my love
Yeah, any minute, oh
I don't know if I can stand it anymore
'Cause I'm just gonna say to you
My love, that you better be there)
Can't say, I've found out
I'll tell you to
Beware my love
Beware my love
Beware my love
Beware my love
Beware my love
Beware my loveEmbed
