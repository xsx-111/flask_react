Listen to What the Man Said (Live) Lyrics
Any time, any day
You can hear the people say that love is blind
Well, I don't know, but I say love is kind
Du-du-du...
Soldier boy kisses girl
Leaves behind a tragic world
But he won't mind
He's in love and he says love is fine
Duh duh duh duh
Uh duh duh duh duh
Duh duh duh

Oh - yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said?
He said
(Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo)
Ah, take it away Thaddeus!

Oh - yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said

Oh - yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said
He said

The wonder of it all baby
The wonder of it all baby
The wonder of it all baby
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
