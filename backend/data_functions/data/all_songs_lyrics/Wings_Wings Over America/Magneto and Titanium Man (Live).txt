Magneto and Titanium Man (Live) Lyrics
Well I was talking last night
Magneto and Titanium Man
We were talking about you, baby
Oo --- they said

You was involved in a robbery
That was due to happen
At a quarter to three
In the main street

I didn't believe them
Magneto and Titanium Man
But when the Crimson Dynamo
Finally assured me, well, I knew

You was involved in a robbery
That was due to happen
At a quarter to three
In the main street

So we went out
Magneto and Titanium Man
And the Crimson Dynamo
Came along for the ride
We went to town with the library
And we swung all over that
Long tall bank in the main street
Well there she were and to my despair
She's a five-star criminal
Breaking the code
Magneto said, "Now the time come
To gather our forces and run!"
Oh no
This can't be so
And then it occurred to me!

You couldn't be bad
Magneto was mad!
Titanium too!
And the Crimson Dynamo
Just couldn't cut it no more
You were the lawEmbed
