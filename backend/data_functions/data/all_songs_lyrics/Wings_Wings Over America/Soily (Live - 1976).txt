Soily (Live / 1976) Lyrics
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Said, ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Woah, yeah
Alright!

People gathered here tonight
I want you to listen to me
To your left and to your right
You've got some pretty soily company
Reader, writers, farmer, priest
Breed controller, born deceased
Indian, lawyer, doctor, dog
And a plumber with a fattened hog

Soily, soily
Well, the cat in satin trousers said it's oily
Soily, soily
Well, the cat in satin trousers said it's oily
You know he's right!
Oh, baby, that soily song
Soily people
Come on, baby, it's fine now!
Yeah!

Romans, Italians, country men
I want you to listen to me
I've said it twice and I'll say it again
We've got some pretty soily company
Liar, cheater, jungle chief
Saint, believer on relief
Action painter, Hitler's son
And a commie with a tommy gun

Soily, soily
Well, the cat in satin trousers said it's oily
Soily, soily
Well, the cat in satin trousers said it's oily
You know he's right!
Oh, come on, baby that soily song
Soily people
Well, come on, baby, it's fine now!
Yeah, yeah!
Romans, italians, country men
I want you to listen to me
I've said it twice and I'll say it again
We've got some pretty soily company
Reader, writer, farmer, priest
Breed controller, born deceased
Action painter, Hitler's son
And a commie with another tommy gun

Soily, soily
Well, the cat in the satin trousers said it's oily
Soily, soily
Well, the cat in the satin trousers said it's oily
Woah, yeah!
Soily, soily
Well, the cat in satin trousers said it's oily
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Soily, soily
Well, the cat in satin trousers said it's oily
Oh, yes he did!

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!Embed
