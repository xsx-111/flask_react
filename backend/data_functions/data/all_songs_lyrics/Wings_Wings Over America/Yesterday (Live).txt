Yesterday (Live) LyricsYesterday
All my troubles seemed
So far away
Now it looks as through
They're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man
I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such
An easy game to play
Now I need place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterdayEmbed
