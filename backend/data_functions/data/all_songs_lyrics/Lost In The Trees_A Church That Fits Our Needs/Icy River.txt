Icy River LyricsIcy river
Put your arms around my mother
I burned her body in the furnace
Till all that’s left was her glory
Don’t you ever dare think she was weak-hearted
She led me to the woods where our church was started
Like a ribbon of silver
I put her body
In the river
I don’t care what happens tomorrow
Don’t care what happens tomorrow
Left in the pile behind the shed to rot
And I put you in my painting every single time
Don’t you ever dare think she was weak-hearted
She led me to the woods where our church was started
Like a ribbon of silver
I put her body
In the river
She led me to the woods
Don’t you ever dare think she was weak-hearted
She led me to the woods where our church was started
Like a ribbon of silver
I put her body
In the riverEmbed
