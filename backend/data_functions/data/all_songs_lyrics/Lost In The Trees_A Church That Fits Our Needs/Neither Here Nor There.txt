Neither Here Nor There Lyrics
Ice storm's coming
Nothing ever warned us
Your lantern light
Glows up the forest
Golden armor
Nothing ever harmed her
Oh, you dance through Hell
And come back through the water

I'll walk in a golden light
After the sun burns out
Loneliness, you're haunting me
I'll knife and cut you up
We're neither here nor there
Swept up by the sea
Birds fly into my room
When you sat with me
We're neither here nor there

I owned an art gallery
Until you stole it from me
Oh, my son will throw stones
And shatter all your windows
Golden armor
Nothing ever harmed her
Oh, you dance through Hell
And come back through the water
Buried underwater
I'm buried underwater

I'll walk in a golden light
After the sun burns out
Loneliness, you're haunting me
I'll knife and cut you up
We're neither nor there
There's some place in between
I brush by you in the swamp
A steeple's floating ring
Is neither here nor there
Swept up by the sea
Birds fly into my room
When you sat with me
We're neither here nor there

Buried under water
We're buried under water
(Ghost's talk)

I start to remember
You're not the only one who knows
And now that I start to remember
You're not the only who knows
And now that I start to remember
You're not the only one who knows
And now that I start to remember
You're not the only who knows
And now that I start to remember
You're not the only one who knowsEmbed
