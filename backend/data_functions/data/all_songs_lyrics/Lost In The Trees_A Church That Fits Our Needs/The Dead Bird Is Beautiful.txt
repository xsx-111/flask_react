The Dead Bird Is Beautiful LyricsYou lie in your wheat
You lie in your wheat
This dead bird is beautiful
We found her at peace
She has my eyes
She has my eyes
The golden glow that glowed all night
Don’t you say she was weak
Don’t you say she was weak
I’ll carry her
Because she breathed I breath
I’ll carry her
Because she breathed I breath
And hell won't come into my house
Not when you’re around
Oo-oo ladadada
And I won’t come into my house
Not when you’re around
Oo-oo ladadada
She showed her heart
She showed her heart
You called art a fag
Before you drug her into the dark
You were the victim
You were the victim
You wouldn't let her up
Till she kissed you
Now she’s the villain
There's no walls in heaven
There's no walls in heaven
A golden armored sky will carry her
But I’ll always have her eyes
I’ll carry her
But I’ll always have her eyes
I won’t come into my house
Not when you’re aroundEmbed
