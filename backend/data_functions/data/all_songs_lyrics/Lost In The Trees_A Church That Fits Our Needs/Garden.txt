Garden LyricsThe peace our music brings
The song is our garden
And while we sing we’ll grow
Unlike your killing song
Cause out your mouth come weeds
And my hallowing will turn the forest grey
It’s so peaceful here
It’s where I think I’ll stay
And as you walk away
I hear you sing ooooh
You’re on your own
You kill the peace
Our garden brings
Our sorrow
The birds are hunting
A woman and her paintings
And they pick on her chest
But she keeps breathing
I love her more than words
And now that our song
Can keep the birds away
It’s so peaceful here
It’s where I think I’ll stay
And as you walk away
I hear you sing ooooh
You’re on your own
You kill the peace
Our garden brings
Our sorrow
You burned down my
Childhood home
Our life is short
Ooo ooo ooo ooo oo oo
You breathe the peace
Our garden brings
Aren’t we grown?Embed
