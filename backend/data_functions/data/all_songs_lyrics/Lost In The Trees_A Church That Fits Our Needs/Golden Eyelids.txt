Golden Eyelids LyricsAs you close your eyes
From the water
A golden light wanders with the birds
Where have you been
What have you seen
All the peace when you come following
I'll tell you it's worth it all
On my icy rim
Behind your golden eyelids
Are drops of your hair
Oh, but your tears
That your cancer's fade
On the source of it
On your voice sings rain
My twins were born
Far too early
Called out and laid in our bed of heat
Lead me from this dark house
With your bold fingers
Turn this wicked toxin into a golden church
Please tell me it's worth it all
On your heart beats rain
Behind your golden eyelids
Float with birds in your hair
Oh, no words
That your mouth left unread
Oh my arms are your bed
Your heart beats red
You have such a good heart
For wondering
All the peace when I come following?
You told me it's worth it all
On my icy rain
Worn behind your golden eyelids
Beyond the last words you said
Oh, I followed
On my float away kids
Let your arms be our bed
And my eyes see redEmbed
