Tall Ceilings LyricsFall up the staircase
Flow like underwater
Your glorious red eyes float over them
Holy entourage
And hold me
The light
All these lights
Come around and open my gold eyes
All these lights
Come around and open my gold eyes
I went down the waterfall
Saw your face in the moon
Same with hundreds of voices
Holy entourage
And hold me the lights
All these lights
Come around and open my gold eyes
All these lights
Come around and open my gold eyes
I’ll come around
I’ll come around
I’ll come around
I’ll come aroundEmbed
