Revenge Lyrics
Pain
I guess it's a matter of sensation
But somehow, you have a way of avoiding it all
In my mind, I have shot you and stabbed you through your heart
I just didn't understand, the ricochet is the second part

Cause you can't hide what you intend
It glows in the dark
Once you start the path of revenge
There's no way to stop
And the more I try to hurt you, the more it hurts me

Strange, it seems like a character mutation
Though I have all the means of bringing you fuckers down
I can make myself to destroy upon command
Somehow forgiveness lets the evil make the laws

No you can't hide what you intend
It glows in the dark
Once we become the thing we dread
There's no way to stop
And the more I try to hurt you, the more it backfires
The more it backfires
The more it backfiresEmbed
