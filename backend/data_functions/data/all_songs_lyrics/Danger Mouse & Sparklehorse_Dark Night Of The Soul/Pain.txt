Pain LyricsOw! Ow!
A massive headache in my aging skull
Means I do not feel well
Pain, pain, pain
Bad brains must always feel pain
The problem started with my attitude
It's all lust, direct and crude
There are good people in this world of bums
But, sadly, I am not one
Pain, pain, pain
That's why I'll always be in pain
Good karma will not get you anywhere
Look at Jesus and his hair
Pain, pain, pain
Bad brains must always feel pain
Justice, religion, and success are fake
And the shiny people stink
Pretty creepy, pretty funny
I'm a mix of god and monkey
Pain, pain, pain
To feel pain is all that will remain
Pain, pain, pain, pain, paaaaaaaaain
Pain
Pain
Et cetera, I give up, I quit!Embed
