Little Girl LyricsA trick that people use to make you think they are smart
Is confidence when actually they're lost in the dark
Only someone with the mind of a child says they'll grow up
Cause surfin' down the avalanche your life will show up
It's nice to be loved it can never happen too late
I wanna share my food but you have stolen my plate
Hey now
Hey now go your way now
You tortured little girl
Showing them what love is all about
Where did all the time go?
Everywhere it's gone, gone, gone
You get the point now
You pick yourself up off the bar
She's on his arm now
Does it remind you of the pictures on the wall now?
But you was young and I was not even born yet
If you think I know a little more than
The average person on the streets you are incorrect
Because I'm ignorant as shit, not here to preach, man
You know I just wanna have fun, go to the beach, man
That's all I am, I'm just a simple guy who talks when
You put a microphone in front of him
You twisted little girl
Showing them what life is all about
Where did all the time go?
Everywhere it's gone
Running left in a relationship
Going in circles and I just can't wait
Running left so we can get in shape
Get in shape because we can't escape
Running left because I'm running late
Ending up in the exact same place
Running laps in your relationship
Running away from the subtleties of
The world's always amazed at how much cash you made
But not at how you made it, it's just strange
It sounded kind of cool over the phone
It killed your neighbors and their dog and crushed their bones
You tortured little girl
Showing them what laughter's all about
Where did all the wine go?
Every night it's gone
You got it all worked out
Funny little girl
Showing them what pain is all about
Where did all the time go?
Every night it's gone, gone, gone
You're the coolest girl in this whole town
I just wanna parade you around
Place your perfect forehead on my face
We can leave this town without a trace4Embed
