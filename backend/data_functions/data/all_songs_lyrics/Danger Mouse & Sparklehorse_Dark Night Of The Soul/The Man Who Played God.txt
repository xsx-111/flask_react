The Man Who Played God LyricsThink about the world you know
Now think of where it wants to go
All things you can see around you
You can change them
Rearrange them in your mind
If you love tales of transformation
Well then one, two, three
You could be the man who played God
Hammer it until it breaks
To every shape that nature makes
All things you can see around you
You can change them
Rearrange them in your mind
If you love tales of transformation
Well then one, two, three
You could be the man who played God
The girl becomes a bird on a flower
In your state you feel your power
All things you can see around you
You can change them
Rearrange them in your mind
If you love tales of transformation
Well then one, two, three
You could be the man who played God
One, two, three, you could be
The man who played god
One, two, three, you could be
The man who played god
One, two, three, you could be
The man who played godEmbed
