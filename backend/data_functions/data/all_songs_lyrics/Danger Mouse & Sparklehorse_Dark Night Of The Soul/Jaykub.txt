Jaykub LyricsJaykub
It's time for you to wake up
And accept your awards
Inside
Your tiny little one room
Apartment of the poor
Upon the podium
You smile and you wave
They all thought that you were dumb
But it's you who's on that stage
Jaykub
You work until the day's done
And then you go to bed
And never
With anyone to talk to
But the hero in your head
(The hero)
Upon the podium
You're handsome and you're tall
But actually you are
Just hardly 5 foot small
Jaykub
It's time for you to wake up
And accept your awards
And go on
And smile while your landlord
Is pounding on the door
Upon the podium
You're famous and you're strong
Then the alarm goes off and you're
A sad man in a songEmbed
