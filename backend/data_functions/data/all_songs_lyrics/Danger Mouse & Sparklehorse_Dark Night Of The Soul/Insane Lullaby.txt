Insane Lullaby LyricsHow will it turn out?
Starting needs are waiting out
On the way to the dead hotel
Silent empty light
Falling into their pretty hands
All of them androids have a
One day's flight
Take you back in time
When I wasn't such a
Brand across your breast
Strain upon your back
When a good life was enough
Would it be so wrong
Danny needs you up in his place
Can your batteries replace this heart?
Lying in the yard
Wanting it to be natural love
Of a son for a mother but
Dreams float up
From fissures in the floor
Adding new dimension
Leaving only parts to play
Needs are forming again
A good life would just never be enough
Dreams float up
From fissures in the floor
Adding new dimension
Leaving only parts to play
Needs are forming again
A good life will never be enough
A good life will never be enough
A good life will never be enoughEmbed
