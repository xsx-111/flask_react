Grim Augury LyricsBoth our families after gathering
We're cutting a baby out
With my grandmother's heirloom
The antler-handled carving knife
They were under her grand chandelier
Where we all, together, have shared holiday dinner
But it was your father that was holding the knife
Yeah, I begged you not to make me tell ya
Yeah, I pleaded with you to, to leave it alone
I told ya
I told you that you didn't want to know
What went on in my horrible dream
I was peering in through the picture window
It was a heart-warming tableau
Like a Norman Rockwell painting
Until I zoomed in
I was making noises in my sleep
But you wouldn't believe me when I told ya
That I wasn't with someone in my dream
Catfish were wriggling in blood and gore in the kitchen sink
Yeah, I told ya, I told ya, I told you
Now sweetie, please promise me
That you won't sing
This sad song, grim auguryEmbed
