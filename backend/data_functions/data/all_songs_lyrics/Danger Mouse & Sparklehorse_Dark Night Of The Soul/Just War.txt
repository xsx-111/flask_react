Just War LyricsAll ancient towers will one day crumble into the sea
Defaced by armies
Intent on rendering obsolete
Just war, Just war
You said it wouldn't hurt
Just war, Just war
Is this just war?
Is this just war?
The last survivor crawling through the dust
And furthermore
Will evolution diminish right in front of us
Late September
I heard the siren call a truce
But by December
My head returned into the noose
Just war, Just war
You said it wouldn't hurt
Goodbye, sleep time
Cause surely, it's ain't just war
The last survivor crawling through the dust
And furthermore
Will evolution diminish right in front of us
There is just war
The last survivor crawling through the dust
There is just war
A contribution till humankind
