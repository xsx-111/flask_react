Downtown Lyrics
There's a place called Downtown
Where the hippies all go
And they dance the charleston
And they do the limbo
Yeah the hippies all go there
'Cause they want to be seen
It's like a room
Full of pictures
It's like a psychedelic dream

Downtown
Let's go downtown
Downtown at night
Downtown
Let's have a party
Downtown at night

Yeah it's
Right around the corner
Up and down the hill
When you hear the band playing
It's gonna give you a chill
Give your money to the gateman
Young blood in his eye
Hold on to your baby
When you slip into the sky

Jimi's playing in the back room
Led Zeppelin on stage
There's a mirror ball twirling
And a note from Page
Like a water-washed diamond
In a river of sin
Going down like a whirlpool
When you get sucked in
