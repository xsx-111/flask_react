Throw Your Hatred Down Lyrics
Here in the conscious world
We place our theories down
Why man must bring us
To our knees
Before he sees the weakness
Of his sinful plan
The power in his hand
Will never touch a friend

Throw your hatred down
Throw your hatred down

Meanwhile in the underworld
The weaknesses are seen
By peasants and presidents
Who plan the counter-scheme
Children in the schoolyard
Finish choosing teams
Divided by their dreams
While a TV screams

The wheel of fortune
Keeps on rolling down
The street that's paved
With sinful plans
There but for circumstance
May go you or I
Dressed in gold lame
Find a place to stay
