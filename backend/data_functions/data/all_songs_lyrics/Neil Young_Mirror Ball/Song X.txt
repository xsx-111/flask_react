Song X LyricsHey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Where life's a joy
For girls and boys
And only will get better
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Romeo and Juliet
The doctor and his case
Without a plan they left the van
And there were laid to waste
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
The priest was there
With sandy hair
Religion by his side
He saw his law was broken
The punishment was applied
Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

He held her hand
And wished her well
Although his heart was aching
The cameras rolled
The print was bold
The holy war was breaking
It's hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Where life's a joy
For girls and boys
And only will get better
Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

The priest was there
With sandy hair
Religion by his side
He saw his law was broken
The punishment was appliedEmbed
