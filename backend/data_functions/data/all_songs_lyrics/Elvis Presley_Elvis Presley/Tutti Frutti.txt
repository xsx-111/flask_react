I got a gal named Sue, she knows just what to do
I got a gal named Sue, she knows just what to do
She rock me to the east, she rock me to the west
She's the gal that I love best

Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

Wop-bom-a-loowah, belah-bam-boom

I got a gal named Daisy, she almost drives me crazy
I got a gal named Daisy, she almost drives me crazy
She knows how to love me, yes indeed
Boy, you don't know what she do to me
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
