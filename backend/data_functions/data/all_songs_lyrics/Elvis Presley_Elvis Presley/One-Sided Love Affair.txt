One-Sided Love Affair Lyrics
If you want to be loved
Baby, you've got to love me too
If you want to be loved
Baby, you've got to love me too
Oh yeah, 'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair

If you want to be kissed
Well, you've got to kiss me too
Oh yeah, if you want to be kissed
Well, you've got to kiss me too
Oh yeah, 'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair

Well, fair exchange bears no robbery
And the whole world will know that it's true
Understanding solves all problems, baby
That's why I'm telling you

If you want to be hugged
Well, you got to hug me, too
Oh yeah, if you want to be hugged
Well, you've got to hug me, too
Oh yeah, 'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair
Yeah

Well, if you know you can't take it
Baby, why try to give it?
If you know you can't take it
Then baby, why try to give it?
'Cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair

Well, fair exchange bears no robbery
And the whole world will know that it's true
Understanding solves all problems, baby
That's why I'm telling you

If you want to be hugged
Well, you got to hug me, too
Oh yeah, if you want to be hugged
Well, you've got to hug me, too
Oh yeah, 'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair
'Cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair
'Cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair1Embed
