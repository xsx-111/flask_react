Cappo LyricsIt's our duty to feel overwhelmed and
Reminiscing so it's so
It's a problem too
It's a problem without too
Trying to come up inside
Don't you wanna cry
If I was you I'd wanna try and force it out
Break it off as soon as I could start
And maybe quit if I was trying
Maybe stop if it's too hardEmbed
