Here Should Be My Home LyricsJump on the tube
Just to see you
My heart's in a tunnel baby what can I do?
So walk it off and plant your seed
You take me over there is that just what it means?
Take your advice
Seen that man twice
My mind's in a black hole baby for you tonight
So walk it off walk you around
If I'm a hundred then I'm too much on the ground
So walk it off walk you around
Your problem's bigger but more than what I found
I made a home where I shouldn't go
If I'm around here then here should be my home
But it's not at allEmbed
