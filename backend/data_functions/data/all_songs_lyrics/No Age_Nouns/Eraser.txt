Eraser LyricsIt's an eyesore
My head was shaved
It's a pain sometimes
I try to walk on by
A witness now in every place
A window broke
I wonder what I get paid
Watch him die
A window now in every place
A witness spoke
I wonder what I get paid
Watch him die
Wait for the foreman now get paid
Wait and see the list of shit you made
Gotta see my heart's a darker place
Gotta be my soul's the one who paysEmbed
