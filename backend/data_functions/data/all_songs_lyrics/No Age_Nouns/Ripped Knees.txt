Ripped Knees LyricsI see rivers in my sleep they're filled with blood
Don't you count me cuz my home's a desperate one
I got time but not for you the trouble is
This agenda's life and life is a new win
I got curtains at my feet that weigh a ton
Aren't you over me? Your problems just begun
If I'm an island then your mind is off of me
If I'm an island then you're the darkest sea
I know that you're the dreary oneEmbed
