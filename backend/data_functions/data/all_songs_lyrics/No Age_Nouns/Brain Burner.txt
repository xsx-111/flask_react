Brain Burner LyricsI couldn't make it cold so that's what I become
Looks like the cop was wrong I'm not the only one
Do it every day for school and see the damage done
I couldn't make him made he's useless and alone
They make you look ugly and party for a home
Are you confused why this is not his zone?
He had a son but his son died fell apart he's cold
I couldn't make it cold so that's what I become
Looks like the cop was wrong I'm not the only one
Do it every day for school see the damage done
He had a son but his son died fell apart he's cold
Please decide for me and I could make it warm
There's bottles everywhere and soft spots in my son
They took me out and took me young the damage has been done
It's not a cop it's not a dad but look what I've becomeEmbed
