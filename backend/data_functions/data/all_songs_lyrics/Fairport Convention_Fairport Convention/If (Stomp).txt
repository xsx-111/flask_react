If (Stomp) LyricsIf I were rich enough
To make you need me as much as I need you
If I could pitch enough
You'd realize what a little country bread can do
Well, if my Ma had come very far
And if my Pa was an oil-rig big-wig around our money town
If I were rich enough
To give you entertainment in the manner that you've been accustomed to
If I could stitch enough
I'd save you nine and throw in a Dixie too
Well, if I knew that you'd give me good times too
And if I knew that the loved one that I love loved me too
If I were rich enough
To make you need me too
If I were rich enough
To see you pretty, looking like a scene I'd dream
If you were bitch enough
You'd leave me here, a king without a queen
Well, if you do, if you leave your little boy blue
If you do, I'll shut you and you'll shout and you'll know it too
If I were rich enough
To have a ?? for every single day I'll wake
And if I acted rough
You'd want me more than just for wanting's sake
Mmmmm, that ain't so, I'll always be this way
Feelings grow, do the time when the sun shines then we'll know
If I were rich enough
To make you need me tooEmbed
