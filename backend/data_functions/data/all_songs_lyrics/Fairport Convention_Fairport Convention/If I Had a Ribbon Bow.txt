If I Had a Ribbon Bow LyricsIf I had a ribbon bow to tie my hair
And a gown of calico for me to wear
I'd surely get a sweetheart, a prince or a king
A palace home where I could have everything
If I had a ribbon bow to tie my hair
This old robe of calico, I wouldn't care
I'd stay up in my castle and I'd always wear
A ribbon bow so fine to tie my hair
All the live long day to the Lord above me
All I do is pray for someone to love me
If I had ribbon bow all nice and clean
I could be a princess or a fairy queen
Prince Charming then would court me, his love he would swear
If I had a ribbon bow to tie my hair
There's a story of a girl, a story seldom told
What she wanted from this world was not of gems or gold
Her wishes were quite plain, as you will see
For often she would simply make this plea
All the live long day to the Lord above me
All I do is pray for someone to love me
If I had ribbon bow all nice and clean
I could be a princess or a fairy queen
Prince Charming then would court me, his love he would swear
If I had a ribbon bow, a pretty little ribbon bow
Prince Charming then would court me, his love he would swear
If I had a ribbon bow to tie my hairEmbed
