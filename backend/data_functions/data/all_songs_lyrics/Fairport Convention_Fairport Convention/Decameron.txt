Decameron LyricsShe doesn't see the day to day
No colors where the children play
She doesn't see the things she's sown
White crosses painted on the door
See me fly, see me cry, see me walk away
Every time the sun shines, to me, it's a rainy day
He didn't see the summer go
Though he knew what the shadows know
He didn't see his arm grow old
He didn't feel his blood run cold
See me fly, see me cry, see me walk away
Every time the sun shines, to me, it's a rainy day
They listened to his voice grow pale
No stamps were on the morning mail
They all listened to the white truck ring
Words just didn't mean a thing
See me fly, see me cry, see me walk away
Every time the sun shines, to me, it's a rainy day1Embed
