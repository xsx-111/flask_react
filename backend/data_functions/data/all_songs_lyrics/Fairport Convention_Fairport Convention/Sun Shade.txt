Sun Shade LyricsDying's not easy today
Trying, but can't get away
Feel just the almost touch of her hand
And the trees in her hair
Lies float the sun
She saw only me in the sky
What could be higher than we?
Wind grows cold in the trees
She cries, so hard to please
My restless feet, the rain in the street and her Vanity Fair
Sighs in the eyes of the boarding-house lady who stares
Thinking I care
So it's a long dusty road
Feelings I shouldn't have showed
Follow me with a sweet heart
When I'm ready to fade
Lights like these burn so bright
Keep me out of my shade
Wish I could fade
Just see me fade
Just see me fade
Just see me fade
Just see me fade
Just see me fade
See me fadeEmbed
