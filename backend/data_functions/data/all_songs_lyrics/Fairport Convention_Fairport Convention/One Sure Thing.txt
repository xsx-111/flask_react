One Sure Thing LyricsHe used to be the only man I would see
He used to be the only good man for me
Oh, he used to be my one sure thing
Look at me now, what you see, it isn't me
Look at me now, just a leaf without a tree
Oh, he used to be my one sure thing
My man, he doesn't care for me
And what he does, he doesn't do for me
And when I need something
To him, it doesn't mean a thing
You know he used to be my one sure thing
My man, he doesn't care for me
And what he does, he doesn't do for me
And when I need something
To him, it doesn't mean a thing
You know he used to be my one sure thingEmbed
