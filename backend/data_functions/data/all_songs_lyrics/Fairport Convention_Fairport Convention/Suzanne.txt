Suzanne LyricsSuzanne takes you down to a place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And you know that she is half-crazy
That's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
Just when you want to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust her
For she touched your perfect body with her mind
And Jesus was a sailor
When He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him
He said, "All men shall be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them"
But He Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think you'll maybe trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with His mind
Suzanne takes you down to a place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Amid the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust her
For you've touched her perfect body with your mindEmbed
