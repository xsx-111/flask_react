Reno, Nevada LyricsIt's a long, long way down to Reno, Nevada
It's a long, long way to your home
And the change in your pocket is beginning to grumble
And you reap just about what you've sown
You can walk down the street
Pass your face in the window
You can go on fooling around
You can work night and day
Take a chance on promotion
You can fall through a hole in the ground
Now there ain't no game like the game that you're playing
When you got a little something to lose
And there ain't no time like the time that you're wasting
And you waste just about what you choose
There's a man at the table
And you know he's been able
To return all the odds that you lay
Hey, but you can't feed your hunger
And you ain't getting younger
And your tongue ain't got nothing to say
And it's a long, long way down to Reno, Nevada
It's a long, long way to your home
And the ground underneath you is beginning to tremble
And the sky up above you has grown
There's a time to be breathing
And a time to be stealing
And a time just to spot on the wall
But the odds have been doubled
And it ain't worth the trouble
And you're feeling going nowhere at all
It's a long, long way down to Reno Nevada
And a long, long way to your home
But the change in your pocket is beginning to grumble
And you reap just about what you've sown
There's a man on the table
And you know he's been able
To return all the odds that you lay
And you can't feed your hunger
And you ain't getting younger
And your tongue ain't got nothing to sayEmbed
