Time Will Show the Wiser LyricsMy mind keeps on telling me that this is no good
And my heart is aching, that tells me I should
But only time will show the wiser
I've fallen in love with a girl that's not mine
If I take her, it will hurt him, a very best friend of mine
But I know that I need someone to hold, to love
And my mind says I shouldn't, but my heart says I should
And I don't know which to go by, my mind or my heart
And this is so confusing, it's tearing me apart
Time, it will show the wiser
Well, I wish someone would help me, this decision is mine
And my morals and emotions are hard to combine
And there is no easy way out to limit the time
That it takes till she finds out for the love that I hide
And I don't know which to go by, my mind or my heart
And this is so confusing, it's tearing me apart
Time, it will show the wiser
Time, it will show the wiser
Time, it will show the wiserEmbed
