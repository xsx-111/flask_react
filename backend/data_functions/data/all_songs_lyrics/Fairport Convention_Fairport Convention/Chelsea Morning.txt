Chelsea Morning LyricsWoke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums
Oh won't you stay? We'll put on a day
And we'll wear it 'til the night comes
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on my wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal peaks to beckon
Oh won't you stay? We'll put on a day
There's a sideshow every second
Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passers-by
And pictures fly and papers lie
Just waiting to blow away
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges too
And the light poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses
Oh won't you stay? We'll put on a day
And we'll talk in present tenses
Now the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I'll bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight, by jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you wake up
It's a Chelsea morningEmbed
