Recovery Lyrics
Blacking in and out in a strange flat in east London
Somebody I don't really know just gave me something
To help settle me down and to stop me from always thinking about you
And you know your life is heading in a questionable direction
When you're up for days with strangers and you can't remember anything
Except the way you sounded when you told me you didn't know what I should do

It's a long road up to recovery from here
A long way back to the light
A long road up to recovery from here
A long way to making it right

And I've been waking in the morning just like every other day
And just like every boring blues song I get swallowed by the pain
And so I fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away
But you're not lying there any longer
And I know that that's my fault
So I've been pounding on the floor and
I've been crawling up the walls
And I've been dipping in my darkness with Serotonin-boosters
Cider and some kind of smelling salts!

It's a long road up to recovery from here
A long way back to the light
A long road up to recovery from here
A long way to making it right
And on the first night we met you said, "Well darling, let's make a deal
If anybody ever asks us let's just tell them that we met in jail."
And that's the story that I'm sticking to like a stony-faced accomplice
But tonight I need to hear some truth if I'm ever getting through this
Yeah you once sent me a letter that said, "If you're lost at sea
Close your eyes and catch the tide my dear and only think of me"
Well, darling, now I'm sinking, and I'm as lost as lost can be
And I was hoping you could drag me up from down here towards my recovery

If you could just give me a sign, just a subtle little glimmer
Some suggestion that you'd have me if I could only make me better
Then I would stand a little stronger as I walk a little taller
All the time
Because I know you are a cynic
But I think I can convince you
Yeah, cause broken people can get better if they really want to
Or at least that's what I have to tell myself if I am hoping to
Survive!

It's a long road up to recovery from here
A long way back to the light
A long road up to recovery from here
A long way to making it right
Darling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover?
Darling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover?
Darling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover?
Darling, sweet lover, one day this will all be over13Embed
