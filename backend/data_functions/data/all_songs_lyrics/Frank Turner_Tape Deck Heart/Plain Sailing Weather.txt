Plain Sailing Weather Lyrics
Just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing

Amélie lied to me, this was supposed to be easy
I found the one damn person to help me fall asleep in the night
But sleeping gets tiring, and dark reminds me of dying
And as long as this feeble heart is still beating
You will find me rushing through every room, switching on all the lights
The problem with falling in love in late night bars
Is that there's always more nights, there's always more bars
The problem with showing your lover your scars
Is that everybody's lover is covered in scars

So give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up every—

Things got fractious, and I felt faithless
At that moment just before the dawn when everything falls apart
But baby, I didn't mean it, for things to get desperate
I let slip my guard, I let go of the rudder
Now we're drifting in the current away from one another
Give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up everything
Give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing
Every little goddamn thing
Every little goddamn thing
Every little goddamn thing

And I've been skirting round the rim
Of doing something brave
And not just standing, but jumping in
Of making circles into squares
Of laying down the bare facts
Like a burden I can't bear
And I can almost find the words
But I can see the way you'd
Fold your hands, speak my name like a curse upon your pretty lips
The pressured white behind your fingertips
And when you see me for all that I am
I couldn't make mistakes to make a difference any more
I'd throw myself down on my knees, at your hands
And beg you for forgiveness for my fuckups and my faults
And maybe you'd relent and return my hope for our forever
Lift up your precious hands, and then bring yours and mine together
So give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
Just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather4Embed
