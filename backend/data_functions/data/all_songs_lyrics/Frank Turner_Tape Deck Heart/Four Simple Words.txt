Four Simple Words LyricsBecause we're all so very
Twenty-first century
You're probably listening to me
On some kind of portable stereo
Maybe you're sitting on the back of the bus
Or it's running up your sleeve and you're across from your boss
Or you're sitting in your bedroom on your own
With the lights down low
I'd like to teach you four simple words
So the next time you come to a show
You could sing those words back at me
Like they're the only words that you know

I want to dance, I want to dance
I want lust, and love, and a smattering of romance
But I'm no good at dancing, and yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm gonna play it straight, I'm gonna take my chance
I want to dance
Heigh ho heigh ho heigh ho!
We're heading out to the punk rock show!
Colleagues and friends condescend with a smile
Yeah, but this is my culture, man, this is my home
The dark huddled masses gather at the gate
Yeah, the doors are at seven and the show starts at eight
A few precious hours in a space of our own
And when the band comes on, the only thing I really know
I want to dance, I want to dance
I want lust, and love, and a smattering of romance
But I'm no good at dancing, and yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm gonna play it straight, I'm gonna take my chance
I want to dance
Yeah, is anybody else sick of the music that's churned out by lackluster scenesters from Shoreditch?
Yeah, it's all sex, drugs and sins, like they're extras from Skins!
But it's OK, cause they don't really mean it!
I want bands who had to work for their keep
Drove a thousand miles and played a show on no sleep
Sleeping on the floor at a stranger's place
Hungry just to do it all again the next day!

I want to dance, I want to dance
I want lust, and love, and a smattering of romance
But I'm no good at dancing, and yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm gonna play it straight, I'm gonna take my chance
I want to dance
So put your hands on your hips
And bring your knees in tight
Yeah, we do this shit together man
No fists, no fights!
We're not trying to save the world
So people think like us
We just want our own space to dance, man
No favours, no fuss
Yeah, on blood, sweat and vinyl we have built ourselves a house
If the roof is on fire, then we're gonna put it out
Forget about your bitching and remember that you're blessed
Because punk is for the kids who never fit in with the rest
Alright
Somebody told me that music with guitars
Was going out of fashion and I had to laugh
This shit wasn't fashionable when I fell in love
If the hipsters move on, why should I give a fuck?

I wanna dance, I wanna dance
I want me some lust, some love, and a smattering of that old time romance
But I'm no good at dancing, and yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm gonna play it straight, I'm gonna take my chance
Yeah, I want to dance
I want to dance
I want you and me both to join hands down at the front
So the next time I see you, remember these words, oh
We'll sing like the barricades are down and we'll dance like no one's around
