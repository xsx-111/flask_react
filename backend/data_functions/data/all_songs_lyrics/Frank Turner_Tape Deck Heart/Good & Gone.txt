Good & Gone Lyrics
I have searched for you
In the darkness of a dozen dingy dancefloors
In countless queues of cafés in the suburbs
In the bedclothes of a thousand stranger's bedrooms
I have yearned for you
In the airless hubs of international airports
In the hollow hell of many hundred hotels
In the solitary stillness of the early hours
And I still do

Sometimes the things you need
Are right back where you started from

So fuck you, Hollywood
For teaching us that love was free and easy
For dressing all our daughters as princesses
For gulling us with tales of happy endings
And fuck you, Mötley Crüe
For charming us with access and with excess
For telling tales that leave out all the dark sides
For bringing out the lowest drive in everyone
Oh, fuck you
Sometimes the things you need
Are right back where you started from
Sometimes the things you need
They hang around a little while
Then they're good and gone

If I could just have a second try
I'd take the second call you made that night
Find myself an airport, find a credit card, find a flight, or something
And head back to the start

Sometimes the things I need are right back where I started from
Sometimes the things I need, they hang around a little while
Then they're good and gone
Yes, they're good and gone1Embed
