Cowboy Chords Lyrics

You could say I reached that time I know my trade
And that I know how to care for my guitar
And I know how to get it played
I'm comfortable and I sleep on a floor
I've played a fair few shows
And I'm gonna play more
And all along the while I was just trying to raise a smile

I play cowboy chords
For these air conditioned words
About longing for the prairie and living in the suburbs
I sing simple songs
About nights and wrongs
About finding that trail that leads away from everyone

And darling, I know I did not give you much
I got hungry for some wandering
And I don't come back for months
And I kept your picture by my side
It's in my wallet, it's on my mind
And every song I know contains a whisper of your soul

And so my days slip away
They're all the same
Rolling wheels, hotel rooms
And going grey
Casting glances over my shoulders as I go
Trying not to dwell on things I do not know

I know my trade out on these boards, cowboy chords
I know my trade out on these boards, cowboy chords
I know my trade out on these boards, cowboy chords
I know my trade out on these boards with cowboy chords4Embed
