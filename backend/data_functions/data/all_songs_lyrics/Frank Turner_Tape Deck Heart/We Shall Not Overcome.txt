We Shall Not Overcome Lyrics
The bands I like, they don't sell too many records
And the girls I like, they don't kiss too many boys
Books I read will never be best sellers, yeah
But come on fellas at least we made our choice, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

What do we want? And when do we want it?
And how would we feel if we knew that we were never gonna get it?
And where did we start from? And where are we going?
Can anyone here say with any certainty that they know what they're doing?
Ever feel like an awkward understudy
Thrown into a cast where you just don't get along?
All the crowd and the crew are standing silent staring
And you can't shake the feeling that, somehow, you're doing it wrong
What do we want?

Mum and dad always seemed like they had a plan
Everything fell apart when mum moved on, now dad's a broken man
And all these decisions, they keep getting made
I can't remember making them and nobody wants to explain
We're all awkward understudies wearing comfortable shoes
Getting comfortable with doing it wrong
Missed the dress rehearsals and we had too much to drink before the show but now it's show time so let's sing it out strong
 x2
Be a fan of every band that made you want to move your feet
Fall in love with every person who ever made your heart want to skip a beat
So come on, come on, come on!
What do we want?
We shall not overcome
We shall underwhelm
Hey, hey
Because the lives we lead, may not be so very perfect
And the plans we make may not serve some final purpose
But the hearts we heed, they still beat the way they used to
If you're doing it wrong, well yeah what you gonna do?
What do we want?Embed
