Polaroid Picture LyricsMan, we used to be brothers
Superheroes and warriors
Cowboys and Indians, train drivers, everything
Rolling through the endless summers
But everything changes
You got married, had children
And I don't have your number, The one I can remember
Is the place you used to live with your parents

But in the stillness of the moment it takes
For a Polaroid picture to capture our faces forever
The world has turned a touch on its axis
And the only thing certain is everything changes
Man, they closed the Astoria
At the end of last summer
The place we earned our pedigree, scene of our victories
Sanctuary in the centre of London
Now they're building a railway
To drag the vanquished to Versailles
And the singalongs go on, but they're singing different songs
In rooms that we don't know on the other side of the city
And in the stillness of the moment it takes
For a Polaroid picture to capture our faces forever
The world has turned a touch on its axis
And the only thing certain is everything changes
So honey, I just need a little time to take
A little time with today
To savour all the triumph and tragedy
Before it slips away
Before it slips away
Let go of the little distractions
Hold close to the ones that you love
Cause we won't all be here this time next year
So while you can, take a picture of us
Let go of the little distractions
Hold close to the ones that you love
Cause we won't all be here this time next year
So while you can, take a picture of us
Take a Polaroid picture
(Let go of the little distractions)
Take a Polaroid picture
(Hold close to the ones that you love)
Take a Polaroid picture
(Cause we won't all be here this time next year)
Please take a Polaroid picture
(So while you can, take a picture of us)
Take a Polaroid picture
(Let go of the little distractions)
Please take a Polaroid picture
(Hold close to the ones that you love)
Take a picture of us to show
We've been watching to see where the time goes
So in the stillness in the moment
Make sure you take a Polaroid picture
And keep it with you forever
To remind yourself that everything changes
But there was this one time
There was this one time
When things were okay2Embed
