Losing Days Lyrics
Oh, my broken battered body
In the days when I was younger
Used to fix itself quick sharp
After every slip and stumble
But these days I'm collecting scars that don't seem to fade
Cuts and bruises that won't go away

And I used to think that I
Would never live past twenty five
And when you think like that, each day
Is a gift if you survive
But I've survived too long for my side of the deal
And as I reach that shore I'm not sure how to feel

Cause I keep losing days
That used to take a lifetime
In the blinking of an eye
And all these small ideas
Are suddenly commitments
Greatness slips on by
Greatness slips on by

And I remember well the day that I got my first tattoo
I was so scared before and after I was so proud when it was new
But these days I've gone and got me many more
And sometimes I get more when I get bored
One for every year I've lost
