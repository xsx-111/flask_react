Tattoos Lyrics
Oh, it's payday, yes, it's payday
I got my pay cheque from the man
There's not so many jobs that I can get these days
With these marks all over my hands
But I'm gonna take that cheque
I'm gonna head across the track
To the wrong side of this town
I'm gonna open the door, I'm gonna bask in the roar
Of that familiar buzzing needle sound

Because the ink in my skin
Where the needle went in
However many years ago
Has left marks on my arms
And they say who I am
Everywhere that I go
Some people have none and
Some have one that they're ashamed of
Most people think that we're fools
Some people don't get it and
Some people don't care
And some of us, we have tattoos
Oh it's fading, yes, it's fading
Some of the things that I believed back then
Yes, my skin has started sagging and
The ink has started running
And I've got buddy tattoos with people
Who aren't my friends
Oh I've even got black x's from when I was straight edge
So crack open a beer friends now
And let's make a pledge
If we had the luck to live our lives a second time through
We'd be sure to get the same tattoos

We've got hearts for the lovers
And playing cards for the gamblers
Black Flag bars for the punks
And sailing ships for the ramblers
We got skulls for the living
And the pain pays our dues
And some of us, we have tattoosEmbed
