The New Sensation Lyrics
Everybody stand up for a bit
Get up on your feet and get down for a bit
Shake it to the snare and get down to the kick
Shake your tiny tooshie like you don't give a shit and

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation

So you wanna re-train now?
Jumping from the right to the left brain, now
You just gotta change your stance up
And re-train as a dancer and

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation

Okay, get on all fours
Then slap that d-d-d-dancefloor
Then scream "I'll die for the cause"
What else could your lungs be for and
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation

Yeah boy, just break your back
Salute the DJ for the music crack
Yeah girl, just snap that neck
Shake so hard, shake the demons shook dead and

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation

Shake your shit like your shits on fire
Shimmy real hard like you're Richard Pryor
Liar, liar, put your flames to the tyre
Raise that roof like the Notre Dame spire and

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Everybody stand up for a bit
Get up on your feet and get down for a bit
Shake it to the snare and get down to the kick
Shake your tiny tooshie like you don't give a shit and

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Do the new sensation
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Do the new sensation
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Do the new sensation
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Do the new sensation
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Do the new sensation
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Do the new sensation
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Do the new sensation
Don’t think just follow, don’t think
Do the new sensationEmbed
