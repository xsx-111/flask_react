Progress LyricsAs heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high, high
Come home to
As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
High, don't, come, home
As heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
High, come, home, to, to
(As heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself)
As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
High, come, come, home
As heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high, high
Come home to
As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself comе down
High, come, home, to
As heavy as my bonеs were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
High, high, come
As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
High, come, home, to
As heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
I, come, home, to
As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
I, don't, come, to
As heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
I, come, home, to
As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
I, don't, come, home, to
As heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
I, come, home, to
As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
I, don't, come, home, to
As heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
I, come, home, to
As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
I, come2Embed
