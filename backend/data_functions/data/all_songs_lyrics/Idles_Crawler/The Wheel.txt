The Wheel Lyrics
I got on my knees
And I begged my mother
With a bottle in one hand
It's one or the other
And so it turns
Again and again
She woke from her slumber
With a crippled stance
She said she missed my brother
And wanted one more chance
And so it turns
Again and again
The wheel

And so, it turns
And so, it turns

Can I get a hallelujah?
The one from the back, now
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?
I hear it from the back, now
Can I get a hallelujah?
Hey!

So, I put up a poster
Saying "where's my dog?"
"My friends, my family, my job?" (Hey!)
Nobody turnеd back now
Except for my man
With a mournful pious grin
And a bag in his hand
And so it turns
Again and again
And then the sеagulls found me
I couldn't tell what year
But with no one around me
The motion was clear
And so it turns
Again and again
The wheel

And so it turns
And so it turns
Can I get a hallelujah?
I hear it from the back now
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah
Hear it for the users?
Can I get a hallelujah?

Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I hear it from the back now?
Can I get a hallelujah?
Hey!
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?1Embed
