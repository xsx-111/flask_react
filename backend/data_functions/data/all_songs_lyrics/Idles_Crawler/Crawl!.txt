Crawl! Lyrics
So alive, some way up
So tired, some lay up
I a bleeder, oh, I yearn
High seer, so k up
Hold the phone, put the call in
Don't go, I’m falling
For a bore, appalling
I'm so, so foreign

"God Damn, I'm feeling good!"
Said the liar to the congregation
And I know I’m not what I should
That's why I'm smashing my pretty face in

And yeah, I'm on my knees for porcelain
'Cause it felt like god to me
And yeah, I'm a fucking crawler
Crawling hurts, but it works for me
I'm alright! I'm alright!
I’m alright! I’m alright!

I'm feeling magni-fucking-fique
I’m feeling magni-fucking-fique
So pure, so heater
So sure, so beat up
So I, so way up
So far, seven seater
Oh no, I'm the sleeper
No go, long teether
Blind fold, gold seeker
I'm told, old feeder

"God Damn, I'm feeling good!"
Said the liar to thе congregation
And I know I’m not what I should
That's why I'm smashing my pretty face in

And yеah, I'm on my knees for porcelain
'Cause it felt like god to me
And yeah, I'm a fucking crawler
Crawling hurts, but it works for me
I'm alright! I'm alright!
I'm alright! I'm alright!

I'm feeling magni-fucking-fique
I'm feeling magni-fucking-fique
I'm on the way
I know it looks bad but I cannot wait
I ride the wave
No rest for the lamb as he goes all day
I ride the wave
No rest for the lamb as he goes all day
I'm on the way
I know it looks bad but I cannot wait
I ride the wave
I ride the wave

And yeah, I'm on my knees for porcelain
'Cause it felt like god to me
And yeah, I'm a fucking crawler
Crawling hurts, but it works for me
I'm alright!
I'm alright!
I'm alright!
I'm alright!

I'm feeling magni-fucking-fique
I'm feeling magni-fucking-fique
I'm feeling magni-fucking-fiqueEmbed
