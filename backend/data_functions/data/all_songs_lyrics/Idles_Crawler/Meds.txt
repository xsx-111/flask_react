Meds Lyrics
Jesus loves a trier
Call off the town crier
Clang that razor wire and
Medicate, meditate, medicate
Hide your crescent bruise
Shine your nation's shoes
Tie your owner's noose and
Medicate, meditate, medicate
Class guilt got me here
Smash pills, feel no fear
I came in from the rear to
Medicate, meditate, medicate
Drugs lost what I had found
Burnt friendships to the ground
Turn my frown upside down and
Medicate, meditate, medicate
Adorn that house within
Lather baby skin
Alleviate your kin, now that's what I call
Medication
Medication

Ornament is crime
Appreciate the wine
Your card has been declined
So medicate, meditate, medicate
(Real nice Bo, real nice)
Yeah

I'm crazy about my baby
But I'm crazier inside
I've got plenty who’d come and save me
But I choose to run and hide
I'm crazy about my baby
But I'm crazier inside
I've got plenty who’d come and save me
But I choose to run and hide

Draft the pedant's will
Embalm the shoes you fill
Only shoot to kill
Then meditate, medicate, meditateEmbed
