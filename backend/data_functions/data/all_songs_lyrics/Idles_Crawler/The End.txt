The End Lyrics
God Damn!
God Damn!
Wow!

Cuts like a knife
Stings like a tick
Kicks like a mule
Acts like a prick, acts like a prick
Burn like a fire
Feels like an itch
Hum like a choir
Act like a dick, act like a dick
Cuts like a knife
Stings like a tick
Kicks like a mule
Act like a prick, act like a prick
Burns like a fire
Feels like an itch
Hung like a choir
Act like a dick, act like a dick
God Damn!
God Damn!

In spite of it all
Life is beautiful
In spite of it all
Life is beautiful

Strong like an ox
Bruise like a peach
Eyes like a hawk
Drunk as a lord
Acts like a prick
Sick as a dog
White as a sheet
Sleep like a log
Work like a charm
Lost in a dream

God Damn!
God Damn!
In spite of it all
Life is beautiful
In spite of it all
Life is beautiful

God Damn!
God Damn!2Embed
