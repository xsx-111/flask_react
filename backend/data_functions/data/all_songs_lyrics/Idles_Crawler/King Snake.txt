King Snake Lyrics
I'm the duke of nothing
I'm the sultan of sans
The-the king of diddly
I'm the shell of a man
I'm the emperor of zip
The leader of nought-t-t-t-t-t
I'm the God of zilch
A vacuum of thought-t-t-t-t-t
Yeah

Here lies
Here lies

The jack of fuck all
The master of none
The champion of nada
A neglectable sum
I'm yesterday's news
Tomorrowâ€™s chip paper
I'm in between jobs
And I will be later-ter-ter
Yeah
Here lies
Here lies

A drop in the ocean
A shadow in the night
A wheel with no motion
A dog with no bite
The deputy manager's assistant
Assistant, assistant, assistant, assistant
Assistant, assistant, assistant, assistant
Don't like, don't listen
Yeah

Here lies
Here lies
Here lies
Here liesEmbed
