When the Lights Come On Lyrics
The tapping of the feet seem loud
There's a girl in a whirlwind cloud
I danced with a Spaniard man
’Til we had no breath left in our pounding chests
I shudder like I'm all bereft
I danced grief from my pores
The beat pounds like a knocking at the door

The hi-hats dance like a feather
I'm in, I’m in a paralytic loveless dream
Not a single face I've seen
Is a friend I recognise or recognises me
I black out, I don't want your dim sum
It's 3am, I wanna dance 'til the sun comes
I wanna fight your cousin
I wanna tear through the night like an angel flare
I'm a ten-foot snare
That cuts in the sky with no care, no care, no care, no

A narcissist on a cucking stool
The kids are not alright
The kids are not all
Feels like I'm coming home
Feels like I'm coming home

A narcissist on a cucking stool
The kids are not alright
The kids are notEmbed
