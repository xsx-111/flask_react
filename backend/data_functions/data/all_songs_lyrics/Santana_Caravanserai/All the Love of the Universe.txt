All the Love of the Universe LyricsOo, oo, oo...

New thoughts will purify my mind and clean my body
New lives will fall together like an endless story
All the love of the universe
Will be shared by all that's living
Oo, oo, oo...

And I don't really care about tomorrow
Today is all I really need to find the answers
I'll find the constant flow
Of all the harmony, yeah

And I don't really care about tomorrow
Today is all I really need to find the answers
I'll find the constant flow
Of all the harmony, yeah

Everybody needs a helpin' hand
Everybody needs a helpin' hand
Everybody needs a helpin' hand
Oo, oo, oo...Embed
