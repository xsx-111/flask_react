Just in Time to See the Sun Lyrics
Growing darkness never leaves me
Just in time, time to see the Sun
And every shadow disbelieves me
Making mine, mine a longer run. Yeah!


Clouds will pass and leave their thunder
Just a wanting, wanting to be heard
And all the people, sit and wonder
If the Lord has washed their sins away. Hey, hey..1Embed
