The Lady Rachel LyricsShe climbs up the stairs by the light of a candle
Then the door with no handle is closing behind her again
She places the light on a chair by the window
Says a prayer while the wind blows
And then in her bed clothes she hides
Now she's safe from the darkness
She's safe from its clutch
Now nothing can harm her
At least not very much
What will you dream of tonight lady rachel?
What will you dream of tonight?
Who will you dream of tonight lady rachel?
Who will you dream of tonight?
She climbs up a hill and is handed a parcel
Then she unwraps the parcel
And discovers a castle inside
The draw bridge is open
And a voice from the water
Says ¡°welcome my daughter'
"we've all been expecting you to come"
She climbs up the stairs with the light of a candle
Then the door with no handle is closing behind her again
Now she's safe from the darkness
She's safe from it's clutch
Now nothing can harm her
At least not very much
What will you dream of tonight lady rachel?
What will you dream of tonight?
Who will you dream of tonight lady rachel?
What will you dream of tonight?
Who will you dream of tonight lady rachel?
What will you dream of tonight?Embed
