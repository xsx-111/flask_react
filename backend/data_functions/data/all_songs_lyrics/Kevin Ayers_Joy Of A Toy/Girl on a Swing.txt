Girl on a Swing LyricsShe's got a feeling for the spring
I've got another song to sing
Girl on a swing
Girl on a swing
Girl on a swing
0n a swing
Such a pretty thing
She's not a victim of despair
She's just a feeling in the air
Girl on a swing
Girl on a swing
Girl on a swing
0n a swing
Such a pretty thing
She sways, silently she sings
Her song gives my body wings
Girl on a swing
Girl on a swing
Girl on a swing
0n a swing
Such a pretty thingEmbed
