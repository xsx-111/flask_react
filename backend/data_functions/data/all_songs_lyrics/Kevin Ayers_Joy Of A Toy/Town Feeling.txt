Town Feeling LyricsToday, the town seems like a tomb;
Everybody's locked up in his room;
Making love, or taking love--who cares?
If you take a walk out in the street
Chances are there's someone that you'll meet
If it's someone you know
You'll say hello, and good-bye
Today's the very first day of the spring;
A little girl's playing on her swing
She doesn't know that a brand new show begins
Now you come and tell me that you're sad;
But you never talk. About it when you're glad;
You criticise, and you shut your eyes...
That's too bad
Banana
Today, the town seems like a tomb;
Everybody's locked up in his room;
Making love, or taking love--who cares?Embed
