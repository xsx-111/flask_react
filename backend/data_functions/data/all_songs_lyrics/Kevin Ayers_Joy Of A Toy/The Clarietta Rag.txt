The Clarietta Rag LyricsHave you seen miss clarietta
Riding round on her lambretta
On the mountainside
Looking out for friendly faces
Peering out of mountain places
Waiting for a ride
She's the queen of mountain magic, everybody knows
And late at night she sings with gentleness
Becoming to a rose
Please send her a great big shining star
To show her where you are
Please give her the love you've stored away
And cannot use today
If you meet her in the moonlight
Don't be shy and don't be uptight
She might disappear
If she thinks you want to get her
Stop her, riding her lambretta
She won't let you near
She s the queen of mountain flowers
You can love them too
But if you pick her lovely flowers
How can they grow for you
Please send her a great big shining star
To show her where you are
Please give her the love you've stored away
And cannot use today
Two, three, four
