Song for Insane Times LyricsPeople say that they want to be free
They look at him and they look at me
But it's only themselves they're wanting to see
And everybody knows about it
We talk all night and we're all turned on
Everybody heard him singing his song
Telling us there was work to be done
And we all sung the chorus
Of "I Am The Walrus"
Yes, Disneyland has come to town
Everyone's dressed and standing around
Alice is wearing her sexiest gown
But she doesn't want you to look at her
Beautiful people are queuing to drown
They wait for the lifeguard to put on his crown
But he's up at the other end of town
Trying to talk to the mirror
The scientist talks and he knows what he means
He sits on the floor and has beautiful dreams
Then he gets brought down by a woman who screams
But he knows it's only a recordÂ­
Oh, yes it is
His brave new girl stops feeding the ants
And looks at him with her septic pants
She still knows how to make him dance
And forget about emancipation
It's all imagination
And you and I, we sit and hum
We know something's got to come
And get us off our endless bum
There's probably one in the bathroom
Or in the hall
I don't know anymore than you do
In fact I don't know anything at all1Embed
