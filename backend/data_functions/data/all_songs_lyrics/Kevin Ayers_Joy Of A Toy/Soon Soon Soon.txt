Soon Soon Soon LyricsWhat do you know about nothing people?
You sell yourself so you can buy more
What do you care about bluffing people?
Does it make you want to try more?
We know what you mean
We know what you've seen
We understand
What do you care about bluffing people
Throwing sparrows from the treetops
What do you care about nothing people?
When you're waiting at the bus stop
I'm very glad to hear that
We understand the sky will be visible soon
We understand the sky will be visible soon
Soon soon soon you will be obliged to try
Soon soon soon to reach your moon and die
What do you know about nothing people?
You sell yourself so you can buy more
What do you care about nothing people?
And does it make you want to try more?
We know what you mean
We know what you've seen
We understand
It's very nice to know
We know what you mean
We know what you've seen
We understand
Everybody sing now
An optimistic futureEmbed
