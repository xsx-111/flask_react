Lining Your Pockets LyricsYou've been lining your pockets for no other reason
Than to buy up the things that I gave without reasonable pay
Well hello my old friend you know I've been away
I'm not asking for much but please remember my name
You've been lining your pockets for no other reason
Than to buy up the things that I gave without reasonable pay
Well I wondered through fortune and I flirted with fame
But we never got the money we always gave it away
You've been lining your pockets for no other reason
Than to buy up the things that I gave without reasonable pay
Old benchmark on the park he got lost on the world
But he don't seem to know about any of it at all
He said - all the things that I wanted
You know I had to pay and pay...
And so I say...
You've been lining your pockets for no other reason
Than to buy up the things that I gave without reasonable pay
You've been lining your pockets for no other reason
Than to buy up the things that I gave without reasonable pay
You've been lining your pockets for no other reason
Than to buy up the things that I gave without reasonable pay
You've been lining your pockets for no other reason
Than to buy up the things that I gave without reasonable pay...Embed
