40 Past Midnight LyricsWell I'm waiting standing on the corner
And it's coming 40 past the hour
In the midnight lonely freezing hour
With my insides churning in the gutter
And I'm waiting 40 past midnight
Catching rain in the soda light
Won't you come and call me to your window
Please don't leave me waiting on the corner
We could have the best time
If you lighten up your life
With my pockets holey in the inside
With my bus ride rolling in the gutter
But if you would only light your lamp light
Then I would be here than any other
Well I'm waiting 40 past midnight
Catching cold in the pouring rain
Won't you come and take me to your door
So I can take myself home again
We could have the best time
If you lighten up your life
When I'm waiting standing on the corner
And the soda light begins to flicker
And it's getting 40 past the hour
And I think I won't see what I figure
Well I'm waiting freezing on the inside
Staring up at your window pane
If you won't come see me this evening
I can see myself here again
We could have the best time
If you lighten up your life
We could have the best time
If you lighten up your lifeEmbed
