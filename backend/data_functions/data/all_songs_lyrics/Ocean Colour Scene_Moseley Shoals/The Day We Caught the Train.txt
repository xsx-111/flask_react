The Day We Caught the Train Lyrics
I never saw it as the start, it's more a change of heart
Rapping on the windows, whistling down the chimney pot
Blowing off the dust in the room where I forgot
I laid my plans in solid rock

Stepping through the door like a troubadour, whiling just an hour away
Looking at the trees on the roadside, feeling it's a holiday

You and I should ride the coast and wind up in our favourite coats just miles away
Roll a number, write another song like Jimmy heard the day he caught the train

Ooh lala, ooh lala
Ooh lala, ooh lala

He sips another rum and coke and told a dirty joke
Walking like Groucho, sucking on a number 10
Rolling on the floor with the cigarette burns walked in
I'll miss the crush and I'm home again

Stepping through the door with the night in store, whiling just an hour away
Step into the sky in the starbright, feeling it's a brighter day
You and I should ride the coast and wind up in our favourite coats just miles away
Roll a number, write another song like Jimmy heard the day he caught the train

Ooh lala, ooh lala
Ooh lala, ooh lala

You and I should ride the tracks and find ourselves just wading through tomorrow
And you and I, when we're coming down, we're only getting back
And you know I feel no sorrow
Ooh lala, ooh lala
Ooh lala, ooh lala

When you find that things are getting wild, don't you need days like these
When you find that things are getting wild, don't you need days like these
When you find that things are getting wild, don't you need days like these
When you find that things are getting wild, don't you need days like these
Ooh lala, ooh lalaEmbed
