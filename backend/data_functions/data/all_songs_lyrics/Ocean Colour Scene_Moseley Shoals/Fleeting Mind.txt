Fleeting Mind LyricsThe brilliance of my fleeting mind
Chimes like voices in foreign caves
It chimes in time, takes me where I'm going
Alone my fleeting mind is knowing
Believe it when I pin it down
That's not hard to forget
My hands upon my knees
You will steal from my fleeting mind
Remember all our words
They are just smoke-rings in the rain
That's just a poem in brilliant places
But poets, they are too grim
They steal like party thieves
From crowded rooms
To rhyme their homes with better places
The brilliance of their minds
Will seek with never knowing
Alone my fleeting mind is knowing
Believe it when I pin it down
That's not hard to forget
My thoughts like sifting leaves
I believe in my fleeting mind
The brilliance of minds
Seeks with never knowing
Alone my fleeting mind is showing
Believe it when I pin it down
That's not hard to forget
That's not hard to forget
That's not hard to forget
That's not hard to forgetEmbed
