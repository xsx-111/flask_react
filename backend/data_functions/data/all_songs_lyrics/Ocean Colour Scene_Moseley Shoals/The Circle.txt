The Circle Lyrics
Saturday afternoon
The sunshine pours like wine
Through your window
But I know golden June
Can turn an empty grey
Against your window

And I feel like I'm on the outside
Of a circle

If I walk by the trees
I'll catch the falling leaves
If the wind blows
But I know all this means is
Whiling on the hours
Watching sideshows

And I feel like I'm on the outside
Of a circle
Will I turn my coat to the rain?
I don't know
But I'm going somewhere I can warm my bones

Fare you well I'll carry me away
And sing to those I know
Upon their birthdays

And I won't feel like I'm on the outside
I won't feel like I'm on the outside
I won't feel like I'm on the outside
Of a circleEmbed
