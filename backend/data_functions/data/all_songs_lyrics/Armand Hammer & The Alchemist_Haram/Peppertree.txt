Peppertree Lyrics
When they march me down the road, so
When them ride me down the road, tho

Mahogany with the gold trim, silent except for children cryin'
They never even knew him, then trumpets flyin', the bearers shinin'
Shoes sink in the wet ground, horns vying, sun rising
The pit lying and waitin' like a clever lion, mouth gapin'
And after they ate, chicken, rice, peas, sticky cake
The chillens laughing and playin', forgot they placе
Plates and dishes piled and washеd as women whisper
Men talk circles

When them ride me down, so
When them take me down, so

Bent backed over Wray & Nephew, marijuana cigars, hidden hearts
A dark road carved, the blackness stretch like tar
Dogs beg for scraps at the edge of the hearth
But it's something else out there in the dark
Something else out there in the dark
Something else out there where you are, something else out there
When them bring me up the road, so
When them take me up the road, so
Peppertree wave over me tombstoneEmbed
