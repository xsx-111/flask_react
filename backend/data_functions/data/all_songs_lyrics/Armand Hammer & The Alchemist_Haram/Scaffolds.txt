Scaffolds Lyrics
Somebody need to hear this
Get their bodies right now, do it Lord
Always late with the epiphanies
Like, "Might coulda handled that differently"
At least admit you had your hand in the misery
It's no mystery (It's no mystery)
Group therapy, I poured the kerosene in
Group watched the fire leap
A shred of truth is all a liar need
It all the burn the same when the fire feed (Do it Lord)
Men wrack our brains over past deeds
Indeed the ground's cold but the bones not deep
Wrapped in shower curtain or bed sheet, the bones picked clean
Heir apparent, I inherited a bloodstained throne for a seat
I can't afford not to believe in things unseen
But belief always been dangerous to me
Slumped in the last pew, the pulpit packed
The culprits beg and accuse, executioner dons a mask

Somebody need to hear this
Get their bodies right now
The transcript read like Cam'ron skits
Something wrong with muh'fuckers, I don't know what it is
Am I my brother's keeper? Nigga, I got my own shit
Excuse me, I got excuses, I got excuses
The crowd want blood, the firing squad blackened face cupids
It's always two sides to the story
The gory details is online, feel like Maury
Am I my brother's keeper? Nigga, I got my own shit
Excuse me, I got excuses, I got excuses

Freefall, limbs flailing in the blackness
Hundred hand slap, pardon self, sinkhole blast landed
Earth mover, new gold standard
Armand Hammer, broke exotic on grand piano
Melting candelabras, clocks blink midnight, no invite
Who's the livest?
You haven't mastered meter so you must respect it
As it pertains to how I freak it, ayy, don't ask me no question
I believe in black secrecy
Plumbed to the death where language drown in the thick of spirit (Somebody need to hear this)
Bodies humbly collapse fetal, eye of a thousand needles (Get their bodies right now, do it Lord)
World beat, heavy kick, my city stiff, both liniment
And a .22 under Ms. Bunches' pillow
She read the room and spit snuff
Bore thirteen babies and outlived all but two
I love to talk with fools, I hate circlin' the drain
And repeatin' myself unless I'm barring on a stage (Do it Lord)
The price done doubled, the ice pebbled, the mint muddled
A vision, receiving all I signal out
There's a part beyond me, plus chaos
Somebody need to hear this
Get their bodies right now
Somebody need to hear this
Get their bodies right now, do it Lord2Embed
