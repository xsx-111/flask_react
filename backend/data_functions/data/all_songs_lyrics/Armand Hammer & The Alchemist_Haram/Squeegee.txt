Squeegee Lyrics
My favorite mystery, sensitivity, synesthete, familiar energy
Centered needs when winters lean
Shea butter cream, ylang-ylang, rub her knees, that's gang gang
Our pancakes were buckwheat, my bonnet pink, that's upkeep
I frustrate, I tuck face, I can't crease, I hold weight
Three-fifth water, more than one way
He swing left, the sun blink, come play, concrete crumb cake
Some stay, some wait
You should go the fuck home, waving east, waving east
Check the pedigree, no edit necessary
It is because I said it'd be, let me breathe, if it's better, leave
As it is, imaginin' the chasm slims
Our path was pure
And we don't feel so bad asking for more

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Sincerely
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Sincerely

He put together a good two, three weeks
Up early, hit the park, sun, rain, sleet
Work out in the dark like I said, up early and early to sleep
Fresh groceries, stopped eatin' meat
Nigga barely even smokin' weed (Nah)
Just one time when he had seen Mark and them in the street
Just two or three hits, just so you know, it was no disrespect
They danced around it but didn't press
The fronto burnt his chest a lil' bit
Felt good but felt better when he dipped
Took the long route, something in his stomach pit, sick
Thinkin' what if someone follow him to the crib?
Prolly not, but still
From the head fish rot, he squat by the windowsill
The whores go back and forth
The landlady bill come under the door
He can hear 'em carryin' on through the floor
They gettin' wet in the hall, smell like the morgue
The taste in his mouth just like before
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Sincerely
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Sincerely

Are you a drinking man, Reverend?
No, it doesn't help
Nah, I suppose notEmbed
