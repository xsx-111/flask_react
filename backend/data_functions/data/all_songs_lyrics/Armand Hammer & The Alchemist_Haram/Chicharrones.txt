Chicharrones Lyrics
This shit is like Reiki to me, man
Man

Got caught with the pork
But you gotta kill the cop in your thoughts, still sayin' "Pause"
Negroes say they hate the cops
But the minute somethin' off, they wanna use force
I just work here, I'm not the boss (I'm not the boss)
I never bought in, so when it go left, it's no loss (No loss)
When they look back in history, make sure I'm absolved (Make sure)
Don't try to rewrite the past, it's oral history where I'm involved
(Green man, don't let 'em do it man, don't let 'em do it)
(You know they gon' do it)
Your crew fragile as the Caucasus, as the Balkans is
It's one nigga who nice (Yup) the rest sausages
Got caught with the hog leg
But you gotta kill the cop in your head
The officer in your mind red handed
The chicharrones was chili and lime

Oh, oh
If you off the pig, is you offin' pigs or offerin' figs?
Oh, you big and bad? Blowin' hay and sticks, huffin' bricks
Clip the snout (Snout) to spite the mouth (Mouth) right the lips
Put it on the spit, pig roast, who got jokes?
Fryers for the skin (Skin) cold swine shoulders get the smoke
Oh, you big and bad?
Puffin' sticks and bricks, crushin' oats
Cut the snout, to spite the house, and check the host
Put it on the spit, pig roast, who got jokes?
We let BLM be the new FUBU, we ain't bros
Wake up like Dap, hollerin' at HBCUs (Wake up)
Soo-wee (Soo-wee)
Seems they serving casings, meat and metal made
US of BDSM, hog-tied, shove an apple in the face
Word spread, Snowballin' on the animal farm
Plans to do Napoleon harm
Keep the little piggies safe inside they barns
Wee-wee all the way, group think, modern day
Sheep callin' sheep sheep on ol' sick Donald's See 'n Say
Soo-wee, get a plate, get a taste
Adam's baby back rib, the other white meat
Sacrificial murdered blacks for the spirit dinner type feast

If you off the pig, is you offin' pigs or offerin' figs?
Oh, you big and bad? Blowin' hay and sticks, huffin' bricks
Clip the snout, to spite the mouth, right the lips
Put it on the spit, pig roast, who got jokes?
Fryers for the skin, cold swine shoulders get the smoke
Oh, you big and bad? Soo-wee1Embed
