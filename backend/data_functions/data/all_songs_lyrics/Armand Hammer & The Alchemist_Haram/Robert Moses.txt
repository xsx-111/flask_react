Robert Moses Lyrics
"Can God forgive us? For what we've, uhâ€”done to this world?"

This time we left the pedestals empty like Bamiyan
Fitted the Bentley with the car bomb, bend the knee
Rep the team, Iwo Jima, Christ the Redeemer, more life
Mike outside the arena, the Rucker
Jimmy and Cam runnin' out they sneakers, C Gutta, LaLiga
Willie Mays wind at his back, frozen in friezes
Project shadows deepen, rusted home plate plaque
Locked the meteorite in a black box
R.I.P. murals but also fuck the opps
Dead men tower over city blocks, I built a church atop
The synagogue where you built your mosque
Dead men side-steppin' the morgue
Pitchforks, gas reek from the torch
Mummified eyes peep like a pit boss
Rayful Edmond III when they need another Ricky Ross
Mandela smilin' forever, what's clever?
Joseph Stalin stylin' on 'em, who better?
King Crimson out the guillotine
You must not got the newsletter, it's a new day
Man has no property in man, the dead have no sayEmbed
