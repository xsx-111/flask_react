Wishing Bad Lyrics
No clocks, they break you, you don't break rocks
Watch yourself rot in a box
Dirt in ya nostrils, worms all in ya thoughts
A thousand plateaus, a constellation of prisons
An ocean of archipelagos, an algorithm
Apply pressure to achieve desired results
Voices in the ventilation float different
Foucault call collect, sound like long distance
The jack keep clipping and clipping
The rack keep clicking and clicking
Can't speak freely so we both just listen, bad wishin'
You don't have to do a thing, the machine grind 'til it glisten
Keep time 'til it's finished, up late sipping
I re-read old kites, faded pencil, handwritten
Re-relive those nights, chest tight, I'm trippin'
Use to be they bail you out for the lynchin'
Now it's Chinese Boxes you disappear in the system
Ad Seg, hospital corners on the bed, poured cement
Woke up, poured gin, Navy Strength
Lord Jim, the wave big as shit
Poor kid, the natives put ya head on a stick

Niggas out here snakin', I am not mistaken
All my problems come from zero conversation
What y'all find amazing I don't find my way in
Y'all was knocked out way before I weighed in
Stowaway in the back of the car, Biggie bled
All the clocks, Brooklyn went cold the night that manifest
No one on Church Ave made a sound until it came correct
A pound of flesh was needed to scale when time to pay respect
Fuck Puff, survivor's remorse should keep him fucked up
Riding out on a warhorse, leave dummies dumbstruck
I prefer Jag then L-Boogie when unplugged
Baptist warlord Sam Sharpe, we all are one blood
Public Enemy number, carry the one
Icarus melted his wings, he tried to carry sun
Georgetown wasn't all good, Othella Harrington
Vic Page went eye for an eye until he carried guns!

Niggas out here snakin', I am not mistaken
All my problems come from zero conversation
What y'all find amazing? I don't find my way in
Y'all was knocked out way before I weighed in

Nikki too flame, make it too hot for the rest of y'all
Off top in the vestibule
Suck a dick, lick the balls like any real bitch would
Fist full of dollars, neck work 'til he holler
Flip it and reverse it, she's one to look out for
I wish she'd get out more
Killer Miller, wild outlaw, mouth sores
All in her feeling like a maelstrom
Smoke the number off the scale and get her nails done
I got bail money, trick, is it snow? Is it hail?
Who wan' romp with a real one? No ducket, no deal, dun
Don't try to play me baby
Sometimes you tell the truth, they think you crazy
Lately I been on some ill shit
I feel you but you gotta chill sis
I'd probably given you a beat but I think you'd steal
Krill smoke waft out in the East, mad dog spill
Belittle niggas, razor tongue, what's up with the what's up?
Y'all play tough and pay for a thumb in the butt
She tell me enough, livin' it up, dimming to dusk
Tracks pulled from the back, wide load pass through
Crude intimate tattoo, is you daft or is you dumb?
If you askin', here it come, this is yours for now
Soft and round, they come from miles around
Beaming down, they say the jaws astound
Working out the building
Literally wildin' for respect, waking the children
Still at it, dawn breaks, drug traffic
Patterns and schematics, quit pressing that goddamn buzzer
There's a lot of blood early on here
An awful lot of blood early on here
An awful lot of blood early on hereEmbed
