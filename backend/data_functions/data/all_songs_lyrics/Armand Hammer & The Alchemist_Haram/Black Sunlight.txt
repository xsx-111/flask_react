Black Sunlight Lyrics
Never too far

Took the haze to church, frankincense and myrrh
The whole thing was a blur
Laughed at first, niggas' politics absurd
I ain't even answer, just let the weed burn
Unconcerned (You bring the stars out)
Spray ya perm
Armand Hammer: Hagler N' Hearns
Shorted 'em like Bear Stearns
It's not a aberration, this how it work
Chuckling at the investigation, niggas is nerds
Cook the books with the bookworms (Oh word?)
Iridescent blackness
Is this performative or praxis?
Are we talkin' about practice? (We talkin' bout practice, man)
Rock the kufi backwards, magic negro, Wesley Snipes' taxes
Dark inside the Ibex with two ratchets
African accents, American names like Dave and Patrick
(You bring the stars out)
Game is the game, just gotta change tactics
(You make the night pop off)
Revolvers to automatics, back to revolvers, nothing is static
Black Bastards; Negro Humor; Laugh in a casket
Yellow teeth, incisors flashin'
Some nights the sun shines, just gotta catch it
For all the world
For all the world
For all the world
For all the world (Never too far)

Smile niggas
Through trials rendered in my full expression, stressor (Ayy)
Pressure cookin', then I got your message, blessin'
Honor self, picking pocket, finding joy, blowing off the lint
(You bring the stars out)
Ay, ay, ay, with all that binds
We deserve to be up out our minds, black prioritize
Cup runneth over what the heart provide
I got five on my shoulder, drawing closer in these darker times
Pardon mine, target, guarded eyes, free the captor
Sliding through her gap toof, might not be no after
I yield to where the path pulls, ooh, it's gon' get ya
Caught up in the snafu, I don't wanna riff, blood
(You bring the stars out)
I don't want to explain self, I don't want to constrict love
(You make the night pop off)
I wanna grow kale
I ain't never hoe'd myself to make the song sell, sell
Ayy, for all the world (For all the world)
Ayy, for all the world (For all the world)
Smile nigga (Never too far)
And I got the promise for my people
And you mad, 'cause the promise is coming2Embed
