Amphetamine Annie LyricsThis is a song with a message
I want you to heed my warnin'
I wanna tell you all a story
About this chick I know
They call her Amphetamine Annie
She's always shovelin' snow
I sat her down and told her
I told her crystal clear
"I don't mind you gettin' high
But there's one thing you should fear
Your mind might think it's flyin', baby
On those little pills
But you ought to know it's dyin, 'cause"
(Speed kills)
But Annie kept on speedin'
Her health was getting poor
She saw things in the window
She heard things at the door
Her mind was like a grindin' mill
Her lips were cracked and sore
Her skin was turnin' yellow
I just couldn't take it no more
She thought her mind was flyin'
On those little pills
She didn't know it was goin' down fast 'cause
(Speed kills)
Yeah
Speed can kill ya too, baby
Woman has that
Yeah
That's the good part
Well, I sat her down and told her
I told her one more time
"The whole wide human race has taken
Far too much methedrine"
She said "I don't care what a limey says
I got to get it on (On)
I'm not hip to the scene of the man
Who come from across the pond"
She wouldn't heed my warnin'
Lord, she wouldn't hear what I said
Now, she's in the graveyard, and she's
(Awfully dead)
Yes, people1Embed
