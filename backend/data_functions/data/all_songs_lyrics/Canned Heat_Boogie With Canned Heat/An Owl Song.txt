An Owl Song LyricsWhat would you think of me
What would you think of me
If I told you that I loved you
Wanna know
What would you think of me?
I wanna thank you, faro
Just for what you promised me
I want to thank you, faro
Just for what you promised me
You know I trust you, faro
When I tell the world I do
You are a money-takin' woman
But you know that's alright with me
You are a money-takin' woman
But that's alright with me
'Cause you're the one, baby
Been rollin' 'cross my mind
I can tell ya all my troubles
'Cause I know that won't bother you
I can tell ya all my troubles
'Cause I know that won't bother you
If I told you that I loved you
Wanna know
What would you think of me?
What would you think of me?
What would you think of me?
What would you think of me?
What would you think of me?
I'm gonna tell ya that I love you
And maybe then we'll seeEmbed
