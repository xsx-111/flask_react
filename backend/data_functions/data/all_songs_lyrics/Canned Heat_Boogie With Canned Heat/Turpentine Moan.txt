Turpentine Moan LyricsMy baby's gone
She runnin' 'round with someone else
My baby's gone
She runnin' 'round with someone else
She won't come back
I just can't help myself
She left last night
Just about half past nine
She left late last night, now
Just about half past nine
Why'd she leave me?
I just can't keep from cryin'
(Yeah, I'm gonna moan a little bit now, hey-ah)
(Yeah, why'd you do that to me, baby?)
(You know I love you)
(Yeah, I'd do anything you want me to do)
Well, what you gonna do
When your troubles they get like mine?
Well, what you gonna do
When your troubles they get like mine?
You take a mouth full of sugar
Drink a bottle of turpentine
(Hey, come on now)
(Aw, I got trouble)
(Seem like bad luck follow me everywhere I go)
(Now, I want you to remember this, now)
What you gonna do
When your troubles they get like mine?
Well, what you gonna do
When your troubles they get like mine?
(Yeah, I got 'em)
You take a mouth full of sugar
Drink a bottle of turpentine
(Aw, yeah that'll kill everything else, baby)
(Aw)
(Yeah)Embed
