World in a Jug LyricsWell, I woke up one mornin'
You were on my mind
Oh well, I looked for you, baby
But you were hard to find
I couldn't help but wonder
How could I be so blind
Oh well, I cried last night
I cried the night before
Oh well, I found you baby
You didn't love me no more
I couldn't help but wonder
What I was cryin' for
I got the world in a jug
The stopper's in my hand
I got me plenty of women
Jump at my command
If you don't want me, baby
Find yourself another man
Yeah
No respect, baby
Oh well, I'd rather be buried, Lord
In some lonely cypress grove
Than have a contrary woman
That I can't control
Just remember, darlin'
That you reap just what you sow
Yeah
I got the world in a jug
The stopper's in my hand
I got me plenty of women
That jump at my command
Well, if you don't want me, baby
Find yourself another man
YeahEmbed
