Evil Woman LyricsWoman
When I see you comin'
Should've started runnin'
Evil woman
Yeah, woman
Offered to you my soul
You ran it over hot coals
Evil woman
Yeah, woman
Thought you were a blessin'
But then I caught you messin'
Well, woman
You ain't got no feelin'
Catch you dirty dealin'
Yeah
Evil woman, don't you know what you're wreckin'?
Evil woman, can't you see that I'm beggin' you?
Woman
When you whisper to me
All the hurt you'll do me
Evil woman
Woman
When you work your way in
Gettin' under my skin
Evil woman
Yeah, woman
The way you laughed at my pain
The way you're flippin' my brain
Yeah, woman
There were other choices
But I didn't hear their voices
Yeah
Evil woman, can't you see when you've fallen?
Evil woman, know the devil is callin' you
Evil woman, don't you know what you're wreckin'?
Evil woman, can't you see that I'm breakin'?
Evil woman, can't you see that I'm beggin'?
Hey, P. Bear, I'm breakin' you!
Woman
Now, my life is full grown
Written on the tombstone
Evil woman
Well, evil woman, don't you know that you're wreckin'?
Evil woman, can't you see that I'm breakin''?
Evil woman, can't you see that I'm beggin'?
Yeah, beggin' you
Yes, I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin' you, baby
Aw, baby, please don't do that to me
Yeah, my, my, my, my
Aw, baby, don't do it
Please don't do it
Don't wreck my life for me
