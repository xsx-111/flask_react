My Crime LyricsI went to Denver
Late last fall
I went to do my job
Yeah, I didn't break any law
We worked a hippie place
Like many in our land
They couldn't bust the place
And so they got the band
'Cause the police in Denver
Lord, they don't want none of them long hairs hangin' around
And that's the reason why
Ooh well well, they want to tear Canned Heat's reputation down
You people in Denver
Will know what I mean
Yeah, the things I'm gonna tell ya
Yeah, you've all heard and seen
You remember when a cop on the beat
Used to rob and steal?
Today they've gone, but the others get it on
So you'll know just how I feel
'Cause the police in Denver
Lord, they don't want none of them long hairs hangin' around
And that's the reason why
Ooh well, they're tryin' to tear Canned Heat's reputation down
Yeah, they're tryin' to tear it down, boy
Ain't gonna do it though
Let me tell you this just one more time
Just one more thing I wanna tell ya
Before I go
It's a shame the Man in Denver
Has to lie and mistreat people so
Now, six months ain't no sentence
One year ain't no time
When I hear from one to ten
It worries my troubled mind
'Cause the police in Denver
Lord, don't want no long hairs around
And that's the reason why
Ooh well well, they're tryin' to tear Canned Heat's reputation downEmbed
