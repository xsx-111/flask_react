Whiskey Headed Woman No. 2 LyricsHi, kids
This is the Bear (Wow)
In 1940, Tommy McClennan did the "Whiskey Headed Woman"
Now, in 1968 we're gonna do the "Whiskey Headed Woman No. 2" (Oh)
She's a whiskey headed woman
Lord, she's loaded all the time
Yeah, she's a whiskey headed woman
Lord, she's loaded all the time
If she don't stop drinkin'
She's bound to make me lose my mind
She went out last night
Yeah and the night before
She went out last night, now
Lord, she went out the night before
Yeah, if she don't stop her foolin'
I'm gonna drive her right out that door
Yeah, now I don't want no woman
That's always raisin' sand
Yes, I don't want no woman
That's always raisin' sand
If she don't treat me right
I'm gonna send her to the Promised Land
Aww, you better watch your step, child
You gonna go on to that Promised Land
Yeah
That's better, Mama
Now, listen to this
I've told my woman
Lord, I've told her 40 times
Yes, I've told my woman
I've told her 40 times
Yes, she don't stop this drinkin'
I'm gonna leave her far behind
Yeah baby, you gotta stop that drinkin'
Yeah, I saw you last night
Being held down by them two men
Haig and Haig
Yeah, I don't mind you gettin' high, baby
Just watch your step, now
Watch that whiskey
Yeah, whiskey ain't no good
No good at all
Never happen
No, noEmbed
