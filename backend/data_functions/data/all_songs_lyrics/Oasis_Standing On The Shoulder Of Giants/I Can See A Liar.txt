I Can See A Liar Lyrics
Baby the time is right to tell it all like it is
And now that I feel godlike there's nothing that can't be kissed
The name of a lonely soul is scratched into my brain
He thought he was King Creole
Until he found out, until he found out

He sits upon a throne
He lives a sleazy lie
But he's all alone again, again

I can see a liar, sitting by the fire
Trouble in his heart, laughing at the thought
Coming as he goes into overdose
I wonder what he thinks of me?

Baby the time is right to tell it all like it is
And now that I feel godlike there's nothing that can't be kissed

He sits upon a throne
He lives a sleazy lie
But he's all alone again, again
I can see a liar, sitting by the fire
Trouble in his heart, laughing at the thought
Coming as he goes into overdose
I wonder what he thinks of me?


Baby, you're a liar sitting by the fire
Trouble in your heart, you're laughing at the thought
Yeah baby, you're a liar sitting by the fire
Trouble in your heart, you're laughing at the thought
Coming as you go into overdose
I wonder what you think of me1Embed
