Sunday Morning Call Lyrics
Here's another Sunday morning call
Yer hear yer head-a-banging on the door
Slip your shoes on and then out you crawl
Into a day that couldn't give you more
But what for?

And in your head do you feel
What you're not supposed to feel?
And you take what you want
But you don't get it for free
You need more time
'Cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more
And I'm not sure if it'll ever work out right
But it's ok
It's all right

When you're lonely and you start to hear
The little voices in your head at night
You will only sniff away the tears
So you can dance until the morning light
At what price?

And in your head do you feel
What you're not supposed to feel?
And you take what you want
But you won't get it for free
You need more time
Because your thoughts and words won't last forever more
And I'm not sure if it'll ever work out right
It's ok
It's all right
And in your head do you feel
What you're not supposed to feel?
And you take what you want
But you won't get hope for free
You need more time
Because your thoughts and words won't last forever more
And I'm not sure
If it'll ever, ever, ever work out right
If it'll ever, ever, ever work out right
Will it ever, ever, ever work out right?Embed
