Go Let It Out Lyrics
Paint no illusion, try to click with whatcha got
Taste every potion 'cause if yer like yerself a lot
Go let it out, go let it in, go let it out

Life is precocious in a most peculiar way
Sister psychosis don't got a lot to say
She go let it out, she go get it in, she go let it out
She go let it out, she go get it in, she go let it out

Is it any wonder why princes and kings
Are clowns that caper in their sawdust rings
'Cause ordinary people that are like you and me
We're the keepers of their destiny

I'm goin' leaving this city, I'm goin' driving outta town
You're comin' with me, the right time is always now
To go let it out, go let it in, go let it out
To go let it out, go let it in, go let it out

Is it any wonder why princes and kings
Are clowns that caper in their sawdust rings
Ordinary people that are like you and me
We're the builders of their destiny
We're the builders of their destiny
We're the builders of their destiny
We're the builders of their destiny
So go let it out, go let it in
Go let it out, don't let it in
Go let it out, go let it in
Go let it out, don't let it, don't let it in3Embed
