Who Feels Love? Lyrics
Found what I've lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside

Thank you for the sun, the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies and fears
I feel love

I'm leaving all that I see
Now all my emotions fill the air I breathe
Now you understand that this is not the promised land
They spoke of
There's nothing more to be
If you can be the remedy who heals love


Thank you for the sun, the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies and fears
I feel love
I thank you for the sun, the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies and fears
I feel love
