The Pilgrim Lyrics
The keys to death and Hell
The ailing kingdom, doomed to fail
The bonds of sin and heart will break
Of Heaven's course, we'll take
Quelling the Devil's might
And ready for eternal fight
Aching limbs and fainting soul
Heavy battles take their toll

Liberty and hope divide
Changing our water into wine
So, to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of Heaven to Hell

Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun

To courage find and gracious will
Deliver good from ill
Clean the water, clean our guilt
With us do what you will
Then will my judge appear
Bear no false Angels that I hear
For, only then, I will confess
To my eternal Hell
Now give us our holy sign
Changing our water into wine
So, to you, we bid farewell
Kingdom of Heaven to Hell

Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun


Now give us our holy sign
Changing our water into wine
So, to you, we bid farewell
Kingdom of Heaven to Hell

Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun
Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begunEmbed
