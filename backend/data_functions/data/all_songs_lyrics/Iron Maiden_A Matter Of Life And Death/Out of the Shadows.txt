Out of the Shadows Lyrics

Hold a halo around the world
Golden is the day
Princes of the universe
Your burden is the way
So, there is no better time
Who will be born today?
A gypsy child at daybreak
A king for a day

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Dust 'n' dreams in fading daylight
Flicker on the walls
Nothing new, your life's adrift
What purpose to it all?
Eyes are closed and death is calling
Reaching out its hand
Call upon the starlight to surround you
Out of the shadow and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again
Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again
Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again
A man who casts no shadow has no soulEmbed
