Telling Lies (Feelgood Mix) Lyrics
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah

Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

Telling lies
Ooh-ah
Telling lies
Ooh-ah
Telling lies
Ooh-ah
Starting fires
Ooh-ah
Telling lies

Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)
Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)
Telling lies

Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You come to me with tears and blame
I'm your future, I am tomorrow, I am the end

Telling lies
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
Telling lies
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
Starting fires
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
Telling lies
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
Telling lies
Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)
Starting fires (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)

Telling lies

Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary
Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary
Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary
(Telllliiing lllliiiies)
Oh ah
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
(Telllliiing lllliiiies)
Oh ah
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
(Telllliiing lllliiiies)
Oh ah
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
Starting fires
Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary
Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary
Ooh ah
Ooh ah
Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionaryEmbed
