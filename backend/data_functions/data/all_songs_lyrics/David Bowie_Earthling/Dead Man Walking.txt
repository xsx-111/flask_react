Dead Man Walking Lyrics
He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle

And I'm gone, gone, gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly, fly, fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there

When silhouettes fall

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

Three old men dancing under her lamp lights
Shaking their sex in the bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked, anew
Like a bad tempered child
On the rain slicked streets

And I'm gone, gone, gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly, fly, fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there

When silhouettes fall

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking

And I'm gone, gone, gone

Let me dance, dance, dance
And I'm gone
Let me dance, dance, dance

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead manEmbed
