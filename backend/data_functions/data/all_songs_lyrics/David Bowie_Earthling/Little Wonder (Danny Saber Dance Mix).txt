Little Wonder (Danny Saber Dance Mix) Lyrics
Stinky weather, fat shaky hands
Dopey morning Doc, grumpy gnomes

Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Big screen dolls, tits and explosions
Sleepy time, bashful but nude

Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Intergalactic, seeming to be you
It's all in the tablets, sneezy Bhutan

Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Mars happy nation, sit on my karma
Dame meditation, take me away
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

You little wonder, little wonder you
You little wonder, little wonder you

Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
Little wonder, little wonder you
You little wonder, you little wonder you
You little wonder you
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder youEmbed
