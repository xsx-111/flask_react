Dead Man Walking (Moby Mix 1) Lyrics
Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality
Dance my way, falling up through the years
Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly
Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone
Spin slack through reality
Dance my way, falling up through the years
Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly
Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone
Spinning slack through reality
Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality
Dance my way, falling up through the years
Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly
Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone
Spin slack through reality
Dance my way, falling up through the years
Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly
Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone
Spinning slack through reality

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

He swivels his head
He swivels his head
He swivels his head
He swivels his head
He swivels his headEmbed
