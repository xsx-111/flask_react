Law (Earthlings on Fire) Lyrics
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty

In the street a man shouts out loud
A wallet drops and money flies into the midday sun

With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire

With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty

In a house a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs
"What a morning"

With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire

Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire (I don't want knowledge, I want certainty)
Earthlings on fire (I don't want knowledge, I want certainty)
Sometimes
Earthlings (I don't want knowledge, I want certainty)
I don't want knowledge1Embed
