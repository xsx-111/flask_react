The Dark Trail Lyrics
Light up the moon
Scratching and burning pieces of you
Something is bigger and brighter
On the other side
Put down your books
Pick up your lighters
Scare me if you can
Nothing can happen

You stay heavy on my mind
Can't escape you if I try
'Cause I know you're gonna ride

Silenced
Sleeping all day cause you know
You can't escape the night
I don't have anything better to do than you
Higher, higher than I could
Ever get again in my life
'Cause I don't desire anything but you

I can pick you up and undress you
Take your blue dress off
And mess me up tonight
Expensive crescent
Impress me with your presence
Now digest your tensions
Officially licensed
To wreck your excitement
You stay heavy on my mind
Can't refuse you if I try
Make me not afraid to lie

Silenced
Sleeping all day cause you know
You can't escape the night
I don't have anything better to do than you
Higher, higher than I could
Ever get again in my life
'Cause I don't desire anything but you

Now I'm on a fucking head-trip
Regurgitate all your ambitions
Caught up in this so bad
I'm losing my head
Is this a subliminal hit
Is this a subliminal hit
Sure, I say I'm alright
But it's not all fine

Because I'm silenced
Sleeping all day cause you know
You can't escape the night
I don't have anything better to do than you
Higher, higher than I could
Ever get again in my life
'Cause I don't desire anything but youEmbed
