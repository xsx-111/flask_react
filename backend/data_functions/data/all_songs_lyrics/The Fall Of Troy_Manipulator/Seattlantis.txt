Seattlantis Lyrics
Oh dear
I've been a bad, bad, boy
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad boy
Shut your mouth
All of it tangled in your mind
Tangible
The way that I want you to feel to me
Light the match
Your pile of clothes disappear

Color ourselves
And shade you in lies
Talk you to sleep
On the other end of the line
You beg for
Your life

Sleep by day
Sleep the day by
Pull the shades
To blackout our illicit games
Arson's just a felony
And trusting you is burning me
Oh my god, I'm cracking up
Is this made up
This hell I've made

She's tying up herself
Let's map apart her cells
And smell the endorphins
She's tying up herself
Who's she gonna tell
Not him
She's tying up herself
Let's map apart her cells
And smell the endorphins
She's tying up herself
Who's she gonna tell
Not him1Embed
