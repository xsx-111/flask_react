Oh! The Casino!? Lyrics
One more time
Just enough to ease my mind
Everything's fine
When it's only you and I
And I cry
Because loss like this
Just don't make sense
I try but I just can't grasp why

Waste the whole night away
I don't know what to say
Disregard everything
Just can't feel anything

Now it's you
I still can't believe it's true
Down here it's cold
When I let myself go
It's contrived and inside
I think I've died
But I'll go on
You're always on my side
Just to hear your voice
Speak one more word
Just to see you smile
