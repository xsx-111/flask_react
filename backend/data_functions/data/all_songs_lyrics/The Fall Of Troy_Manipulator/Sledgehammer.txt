Sledgehammer Lyrics
Without a constant you lost all my words
You never heard the engine turn
Now you're worthless tied to this
Comin' down on me like a sledgehammer
Can it get much worse
It gets much worse
Nothing will compensate
Accept the pain

Thread the needle
Sew your fucking mouth shut
Talk now
Manipulator
We jammed your radar
Introduction to perversion
You make me sick
What could be greater
We'll see you later

Distorting depth with all your jealousy
Another fucking sob story
Another way to bleed
Calling someone to make you
Feel right within your mess
Oh honey, you can't catch me
That's why you never have


Drifting and floating out of time
So sick and tired of all the fights
Cauterize your constant lies
Picture perfect portrait of a boyfriend
Best friends
Oh, that's rightEmbed
