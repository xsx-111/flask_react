A Man. A Plan. A Canal. Panama. Lyrics
The turn of the century
That's turning out wrong
No matter what words they say
You can rest assured

The stinging wind
Surrounding is
Pulling strings
And clipping wings
I knew there was no time
We can dream
And speak through sleep
And in our minds
Pick out the signs
I ruined all the lines


She comes over to me
And takes a seat right across from the sea
She answers questions and pulls from the deep

Calling out to the sun
To the sun
Freeze frames were intended
But lacking funds
If you knew you'd suffer
I'm making it up
Eyes that speak when feeling
Nothing's solved
Lost my sense of direction
De-railed, eject, off the starboard side
Who am I to demand their lives
Their fate is mine
Will I survive

So sweet you called
But I won't answer
Force-feed your ego compactor (x2)
And let go
Let go
If my reputation precedes me
Then I'm staying here comatose
You get your way
I'll get on mine

Shutter at the sight of the front door
My heart might stop
As thin as innuendo I stare through her windows
Play the night away
I play the night away for fear of nothing to win
You asked for my opinion
I'm keeping my hands to myselfEmbed
