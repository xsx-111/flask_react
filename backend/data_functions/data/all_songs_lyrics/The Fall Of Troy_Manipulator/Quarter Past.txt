Quarter Past Lyrics
Quarter past midnight
Sittin' here in the moonlight
No offense my dear
I hope you know
Tonight I write to you
Now there's a question
And a conversation
Did I mention
A foul intention
Well let me demonstrate
Elaborate to your liking, honey

Haunt me, how you taunt me
Question after question
Story after story
Tensions move way too fast
And I'm afraid to say
What would you think of me anyway

Here's a few things that I might say
If you really wanna know
I've got nothin' in my way
1, 2, 3, overdose
You make me feel like I can fly
Keep me up all damn night
Incredible, I know you're skeptical
Believe me I'm not wastin' any time
I found what I had to find
Is what's on my mind
Sittin' here in the sunshine
Tryin' to put you outta my mind
But oh no, my dear
No way, no how
So much to learn
So much to find out
What goes around comes around
In any way
In any case
I'm losing face to find myself
In your warm embrace
For just a day
Maybe tomorrow, baby
But not today, honey
Not today, baby

Haunt me, how you taunt me
Question after question
Story after story
Tensions move way too fast
And I'm afraid to say
What would you think of me anyway

Here's a few things that I might say
If you really wanna know
I've got nothin' in my way
1, 2, 3, overdose
You make me feel like I can fly
Keep me up all damn night
Incredible, I know you're skeptical
Believe me I'm not wastin' any time
I found what I had to find...
In the final act
You bend and wave
I won't let anyone harm you
Keep together for another day
Come to my window
I'll sing you to sleep
Sing you to sleepEmbed
