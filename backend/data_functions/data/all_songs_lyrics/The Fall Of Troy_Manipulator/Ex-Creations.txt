Ex-Creations Lyrics
You're gonna forget your mind
Lock down
Stay undefined
Take your time
Swallow the gun
Take a shot
Let it rot in your stomach
Constantly stumbling
When you think that I speak hypothetically


Whether or not you remember it
Whether or not you remember it

Lock down
They'll be another one
To fuck without a thought
You've made a big mistakeEmbed
