Semi-Fiction Lyrics
Waiting on my confidence
To feel the knife run through

Tear you down and leave you here
Cast your fears aside
She was nothing more than a game to me anyway

Call out
With the little bit of confidence she left here
Shot down
Isn't it a shame that you have nothing left?

Tear you down and leave you here
Cast your fears aside
She was nothing more than a game to me anyway

Last call
You don't have to go home
But you can't stay here
Back down
Everyone you brought down with you
I just can't ever forgive you
Tear you down and leave you here
Cast your fears aside
She was nothing more than a game to me anyway

Pencil you in
Just to erase you
I've got a bad taste in my mouth thanks to you
Pencil you in
Just to erase you
I've got a bad taste in my mouth thanks to you

Company calls aren't fine
I don't see any reason
That could possibly be
Are you alarmed?
Please stay calm
I'm walking away
I don't think you should comeEmbed
