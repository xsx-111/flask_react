Cut Down All the Trees and Name the Streets After Them Lyrics
Break yourself
Not coming out of this foolish game
What could I have said
If you're uncomfortable
Baby, please tell me
Point me to the right place

Run there
If you're going
Then I'm taking you away with me
Just because (x2)
If I had my way
I'd lie to you
And tell the truth
I'm joking
Get away from me
Just because (x2)

Did his helpless hands
Take you away from this
Did it feel so good
Oh no, yeah
I didn't get the feeling you had an answer
Explain yourself
God, it feels surreal

Break yourself
Without a moment to
Embellish truth
Signed by you
Hear the roar
And in a second more
You'll be overboard
Goodbye

This is where we stand (x6)
