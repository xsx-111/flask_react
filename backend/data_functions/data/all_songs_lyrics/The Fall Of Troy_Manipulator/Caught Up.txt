Caught Up Lyrics
Too done up
I've said too much
It always seems like I do
All because people don't learn
They'd much rather teach the truth

Better kept secret
And waiting on a better day
When everything is self-destructive
I can't explain myself anyway

So I'll make my apologies
Just as soon as you turn away
It's as bad as bad can get
Is anyone listening


If I could you know I would
Hypocrisy that's understood
It's meaningless at best
Nothing's making sense
Here right now I'll put this down
To pull you in and hear the sound
A living silhouette
With nothing to give back

Caught up
I'm caught up
I'm caught up2Embed
