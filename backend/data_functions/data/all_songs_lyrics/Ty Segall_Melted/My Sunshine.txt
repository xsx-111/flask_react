My Sunshine Lyrics
Just like every man is a dog
Life ain't no simple child
Some men are dogs all the time
I can only try my best
Just like all the rest
Isn't poetry supposed to rhyme?

Put a hole in my head
My sunshine

I hope you don't have me wrong
I hope you people are strong
Isn't poetry supposed to rhyme?
I can only try my best
Just like all the rest
Some men are dogs all the time

Put a hole in my head
