Sad Fuzz LyricsSitting with you, sinking in the shade
Eating while we're sleeping, yeah, I'm losing sleep
You say "why do I feel so fine?"
I said it's lovely, yeah it's lovely, oh-so lovely outside

Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, you know you're mine
Oh yeah you're mine
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, you know you're mine
Oh yeah you're mine
Thinking of you, thinking in the shade
Sleeping while I eat, repeating things I say
I say "why do I feel so shy?"
I said it's lovely, yeah it's lovely, oh-so lovely outside

Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, you know you're mine
Oh yeah you're mine
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, you know you're mine
Oh yeah you're mine1Embed
