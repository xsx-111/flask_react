Bees LyricsFall in love, fall in love, be happy, be happy
Live your life like a tree, fall in love, be happy
Free...
Be my bee, be a bee, so happy, so happy
Live your life like a tree, so happy, so happy
Free...
Now it's time for us to die, we will fly, we will fly
Meet me there, oh so high, we will fly, we will fly
So I get you won't cry, laugh, laugh, laugh
In my life, be a ghost, in the sky we will fly
Free...
Love, love, we are in love
Love, love, we are in love
Love, love, we are in love
To all of your confession (?)
Aren't we all Jesus Christ?
"I'm on drugs and Lemmy from Motorhead gave 'em to me!"Embed
