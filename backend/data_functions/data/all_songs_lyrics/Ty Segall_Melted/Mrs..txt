Mrs. LyricsOh Mississippi, Mississippi River, won't you send me on my way?
I can see the sun and I can figure I'd be dead later today
'Cause I hurt my woman, I killed her there today
Oh Mississippi, Mississippi River, won't you send me on my way?
Oh help me, Oh help me, Oh won't yah mister., can I have a couple dollars and a place to stay?
I'm a good man and you'd figure, I'll stay for just one night and be on my way
But my lady she hurt me too, she said she'd loved me but she wasn't true
Oh I'm begging you mister oh mister? Tell me what was I supposed to do?
'Cause I hurt my woman, I killed her there today
Oh Mississippi, Mississippi River, I'll right jump right in and be on my wayEmbed
