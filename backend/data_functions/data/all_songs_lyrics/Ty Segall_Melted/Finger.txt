Finger Lyrics
Finger on it
Finger on it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Finger on it
Finger on it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I saw it on the tip of my finger
I got it
What was in it was all in your figure
I sought it

Finger on it
Finger on it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You got it right there on your finger
You got it
Itâ€™s a ringer giving love like a planet
You got it3Embed
