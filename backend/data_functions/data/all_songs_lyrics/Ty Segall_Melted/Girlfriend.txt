Girlfriend LyricsI got a girlfriend
She said she loves me
She likes to hold me
She once told me
Cause she don't mind
Nothing, nothing
Yeah, she don't mind
Nothing, nothing
She's got a new car
She said I can use it
It takes us kinda far
I like to lose it
Cause she don't mind
Nothing, nothing
Well, she don't mind
Nothing, nothingEmbed
