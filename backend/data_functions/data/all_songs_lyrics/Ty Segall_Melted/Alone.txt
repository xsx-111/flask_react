Alone LyricsI got my fingers climbing up your wall
I'll hang around beside it, time your haul
And when you're all alone, I'll climb into your home
I wish that you weren't so mean to me
I'll make you wish you weren't so mean to me
Next time give dog a bone, I'll climb into your home
Alone, alone
We'll be all alone
Alone, alone
We'll be all alone
Alone, alone
We'll be all alone
Alone, alone
We'll be all alone
Alone, alone
We are alone
Alone, alone
We are alone
Alone, alone
We are aloneEmbed
