Into the Fire Lyrics

Take the trouble to decide the things you do
Will not be the things that don't appeal to you
See the mess you're making
Can't you see your faking?

Going to make it hard for you
You're gonna
Into the fire

Turn on to the mandrake that was given to you
See if you can make it like the others do
Feel the blood a knocking
When you're finger-popping

Going to make it hard for you
You're gonna
Into the fire

Stop your bleeding mind before it's over and done
Listen very closely to the message I've sung
Feel the blood a knocking
When you're finger-popping

Gonna get a message through
You're gonna
Into the fire
