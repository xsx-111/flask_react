Flight of the Rat Lyrics

Spread the word around
The rat is leaving town
The message is a song
The misery is gone
Ooh yes, it is
Once I had a dream
To sing before the queen
She didn't want to know
She wouldn't see the show

What a fright
I couldn't do it right
Oh, what a night
Oh, what a night

Mystic Demons fly
All about the sky
With memories of a clown
The saddest show in town
Yeah
When I was seventeen
My mother said to me
Be careful what you touch
You shouldn't take so much

I blew my mind
She was so kind
I could have cried

In my mind
I had to find
A kind of new way
Of being oh so cool
Like a blue blooded
Well studded
English fool

Speak about the past
Times are changing fast
Once I was so weak
I couldn't even speak
Shaking out a curse
Nothing could be worse
Walking through the door
Who could ask for more

Now I'm free
And I can see
And I am me
Yes, I am me



Spread the word around
The rat is leaving town
The message is a song
The misery is gone
Shaking out a curse
Nothing could be worse
Walking through the door
Who could ask for more
Now I'm free
And I can see
And I am me
Yes, I am me
