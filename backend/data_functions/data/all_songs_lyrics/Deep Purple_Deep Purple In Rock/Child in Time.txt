Child in Time Lyrics

Sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between good and bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying, taking toll
If you've been bad, oh Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit, oh by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes (Ooohhhh)
Bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh
Uhhh-uh-uh
Uhhh-uhh
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh
Uhhh-uh-uh
Uhhh-uhh
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ah-ah
Ah, I wanna hear you singing
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ah-ah

Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-ah-ah
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-ah-ah


Sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between good and bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying, taking toll
If you've been bad, Lord I bet you have
And you've not been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes (Ooohhhh)
Bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh
Uhhh-uh-uh
Uhhh-uhh
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh
Uhhh-uh-uh
Uhhh-uhh
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-ah-ah
Ah, I gotta hear you screaming
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-ah-ah
Ah
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-ah-ah
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-aaah-aaah
Aaah-ah-ah

Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh God, no
They're gonna do it

Help! Help!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
