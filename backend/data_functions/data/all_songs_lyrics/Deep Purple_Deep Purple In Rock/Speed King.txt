Speed King Lyrics

'Good Golly', said little Miss Molly
When she was rocking in the house of blue light
Tutti Frutti was oh so rooty
Rocking to the east and west

Lucille was oh so real
When she didn't do her daddy's will
Come on baby drive me crazy
Come on baby do it

'Cause I'm a speed king
You got to hear me singing
Yeah, I'm a speed king
See me fly

Saturday night and I just got paid
Going to fool about isn't going to save
Some people going to rock, people gonna roll
Going to have a party to save my soul
Hard-headed woman and a soft-hearted man
They've been causing trouble since it all began
Take a little rice take a little beans
Gonna rock and roll down in New Orleans

I'm a speed king
You got to hear me singing
Yeah, I'm a speed king
See me fly


Good Golly said little Miss Molly
When she was rocking in the house of blue light
Tutti Frutti was oh so rooty
Rocking to the east and west

Hard-headed woman and a soft-hearted man
They've been causing trouble since it all began
Take a little rice take a little beans
Gonna rock and roll down in New Orleans
I'm a speed king
You got to hear me singing
Yeah, I'm a speed king
See me fly
I'm a speed king
You got to hear me singing
Yeah, I'm a speed king
See me... hahahahahahaha
I'm a speed king
You got to hear me singing
Yeah I'm a speed king
See me, ohEmbed
