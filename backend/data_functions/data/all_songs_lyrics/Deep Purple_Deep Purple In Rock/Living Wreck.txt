Living Wreck Lyrics

You came along for a weekend
But you only stayed for one night
You took off your hair
You pulled out your teeth
Oh I almost died of fright, hey

You'd better do something for your own sake
Yes, it's a shame
Ah, you know you're a living wreck


You said you were a virgin
Full of promise and mystery
But I knew that you
Would bring me down
Because everyone calls you big G, yeah hey

You'd better do something for your own sake
Yes, it's a shame
Ah, you know you're a living wreck


You said you're gonna love me
You said you're gonna set me free
But I knew that you
Would bring me down, ye-he
And cause me misery, yeah

You'd better do something for your own sake
Yes, it's a shame
Ah, you know you're a living wreck
