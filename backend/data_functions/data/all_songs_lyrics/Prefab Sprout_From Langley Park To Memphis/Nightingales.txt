Nightingales Lyrics
Tell me:  "Do
Something true
True of you and me"
That we're too busy
Living through
Too busy to see
What is it
That we do
Makes us what we are?
If we sing are we
Nightingales?
Shine, are we stars?

Who are we?
What we got?
Are we a firework show
Growing pale like a star that burnt out years ago?
Stranger things have been
Stranger things have gone
I find it hard right now
To name you one
Tell me: "Do something true"
And drop the fairytales
If singin' birds must sing
With no question of choice
Then living is our song
Indeed our voice
Best agree, you and me
We're probably nightingales


Who are we?
What we got?
Are we a firework show?
Growing pale like a star that burnt out years ago
Stranger things have been
Stranger things have gone
I find it hard right now
To name you one
Tell me: "Do something true"
And drop the fairytales
If singin' birds must sing
With no question of choice
Then living is our song
Indeed our voice
Best agree, you and me
We're probably nightingales


God's a proud
Thundercloud
We are cartoon cats
With a fear that is biblical
Under our hats

Who are we?
What we got?
Are we a firework show?
Growing pale like a star that burnt out years ago
Stranger things have been
Stranger things have gone
I find it hard right now
To name you one
Tell me do something true
And drop the fairytales
If singin' birds must sing
With no question of choice
Then living is our song
Indeed our voice
Best agree, you and me
We're only nightingales
