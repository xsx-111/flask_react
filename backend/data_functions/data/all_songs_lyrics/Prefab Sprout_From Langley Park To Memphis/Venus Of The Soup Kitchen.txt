Venus Of The Soup Kitchen LyricsThe Venus of the soup kitchen is waiting there for me
And all us poor cripples who've been in the wars
End up sleeping on her floor
Whoa!
When you're scared of down and out
You keep it to yourself and if anyone suspects
You say : Who me ? Hardly !
You tell him Thank your stars, this isn't Derby day
'Cause it's clear you've got the gift for backing the wrong horse, Charlie
Whoa!
When you're scared of down and out
You camouflage your fear with a fakin' D.J. smile
And maybe some boogie dancin'
But there's no need to be proud
Hey if something's hurtin' you
Could be it hurts your brothers too
From Langley Park to Memphis
Last night, last night I dreamed I dared to raise my head
The Venus of the soup kitchen stood over me
Singin' sometimes the job gets you down
You're ashamed that the word will get round
Well all you poor cripples who've been in the wars
End up sleeping on my floor
Whoa!
Now some will spin you yarns to keep you quiet for a while
But you know that's not my style, who needs fancy footwork?
'Cos none of it adds up, no it doesn't weigh a thing
And it doesn't buy you beer, from Langley Park to Memphis
Last night, last night I dreamed I dared to raise my head
The Venus of the soup kitchen stood over me
Singin' here you are, and I won't tell you've no one else but me
Every night I know you'll be here staring hungrily
Well here you are, no I won't tell 'cos everyone I know
Wanders down here every night they've nowhere else to go
The Venus of the soup kitchen is standing there over me
Every night I'm gonna be here staring hungrily
The Venus of the soup kitchen is waiting there for me
And all us poor cripples who've been in the wars
End up sleeping on her floorEmbed
