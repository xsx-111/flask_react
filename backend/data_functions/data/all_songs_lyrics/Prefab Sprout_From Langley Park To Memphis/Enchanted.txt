Enchanted Lyrics
I've been asking what is new
Like my streetwise buddy do
(Like my streetwise buddy do)
Body talk seems big with him
So it's conversations in the gym
(Blah-blah)

Ooh enchanted
Ow-wow-woo-ooh-ooh enchanted
Ow-wow-woo-ooh-ooh

Pray forsooth and I adore
Ain't the ticket anymore
(Ain't the ticket anymore)
So how'd you recognize a king?
You ask yourself can that cat swing
(Blah-blah)

And it's time to learn tiger stretch tiger burn
(Ooh enchanted)
And the calendar pages blew
(Ow-wow-woo-ooh-ooh enchanted)
Like the Montagues, like the Capulet crew
(Ow-wow-woo-ooh-ooh)
We're addicted to friction too
Comin' down the years, plain enchantment
That's the glue that binds and bonds
The dying to the new
Plain enchantment
Ain't no purple rain quite like it

Here's something to dwell upon
Now we're living, next we're gone
So if you've love please pass it on
'Cause it's a disbelieving world
But sensitive as any girl
(Blah-blah, and it's)

And it's time to learn tiger stretch tiger burn
(Ooh enchanted)
And the calendar pages blew
(Ow-wow-woo-ooh-ooh enchanted)
Like the Montagues, like the Capulet crew
(Ow-wow-woo-ooh-ooh)
We're addicted to friction too
And it's time to learn tiger stretch tiger burn
(Ooh enchanted)
And the calendar pages blew
(Ow-wow-woo-ooh-ooh enchanted)
Like the Montagues, like the Capulet crew
(Ow-wow-woo-ooh-ooh)
We're addicted to friction too
Tiger stretch
(Enchanted)
(Now we're living)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ooh-ooh, encha...)
(Now we're living)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ooh-ooh, encha...)
(Now we're living)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ooh-ooh, encha...)
(Now we're living)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ooh-ooh, encha...)
(Now we're living)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ooh-ooh, encha...)
(Now we're living)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)Embed
