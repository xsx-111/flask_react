Cars and Girls Lyrics
Ba ba ba, sha-do-da-do-dun
Ba ba ba, sha-do-da-do-dun
Ba ba ba, sha-do-da-do-dun-da

Brucie dreams life's a highway
Too many roads bypass my way
Or they never begin
Innocence comin' to grief
At the hands of life's stinkin' car thief
That's my concept of sin

Does heaven wait all heavenly
Over the next horizon? Ah!

But look at us now (quit driving)
Some things hurt more, much more than cars and girls
Just look at us now (start counting)
What adds up the way it did when we were young?
Just look at us now (quit driving)
Some things hurt more, much more than cars and girls
Uh-wooh!
Life's a drive through a dust bowl
What's it do, do to a young soul?
We are deeply concerned
Someone stops for directions
Something responds deep in our engines
We have all been burned

Will heaven wait all heavenly
Over the next horizon? Ah!

But look at us now (quit driving)
Some things hurt more, much more than cars and girls
Just look at us now (start counting)
What adds up the way it did when we were young?
Just look at us now (quit driving)
Some things hurt more, much more than cars and girls
Uh-wooh! Ah!

Ba ba ba, sha-do-da-do-dun
Ba ba ba, sha-do-da-do-dun
Ba ba ba, sha-do-da-do-dun-da
Little boy got a hot rod
Thinks it makes him some kind of new god
Well this is one race he won't win
(Life's no cruise)
'Cause life's no cruise with a cool chick
Too many folks feelin' car sick, but it never pulls in
Brucie's thoughts, pretty streamers
Guess this world needs its dreamers
May they never wake up, alright

But look at us now (quit driving)
Some things hurt more, much more than cars and girls
Just look at us now (start counting)
What adds up the way it did when we were young?
Just look at us now (quit driving)
Some things hurt more, much more than cars and girls
Just look at us now (quit driving)
Some things hurt more, much more than cars and girls
Look at us now (start counting)
What adds up the way it did when we were young?
Look at us now (quit driving)
Some things hurt more, much more than cars and girls
Uh-wooh! Ah-hah!
