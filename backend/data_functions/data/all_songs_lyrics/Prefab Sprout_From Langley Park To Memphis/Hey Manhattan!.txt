Hey Manhattan! LyricsGuess what
Summer's arrived
I feel the world's on my side
The Brooklyn Bridge stretches below me
A billion souls all dying to know me
Well here I am
Loaded with promise
And knee deep in grace
What I want is here on my face and
I feel like I own the whole damn...
Hey Manhattan!
Here I am!
Call me star-struck Uncle Sam
Strolling Fifth Avenue
Just to think Sinatra's been here too
These myths we can't undo
They lie in wait for you
We live them till they're true
Manhattan doobie doo
Hey Manhattan doobie doo
Someday's you've got to get outside
Look there's the Carlyle
That's the place where Kennedy stayed and
Where were you when he died
There they were
Loaded with promise
And knee-deep in fate
When what you want shows on your face
All that's left litters the whole damn...
Hey Manhattan here I am
Call it bad luck Uncle Sam
Scrounging Fifth Avenue
Just to think the poor could live here too
But what are they to do
These myths belong to you
We live them till they're true
Manhattan doobie doo
Hey Manhattan doobie dooEmbed
