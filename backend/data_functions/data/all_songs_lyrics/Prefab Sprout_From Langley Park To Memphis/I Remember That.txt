I Remember That Lyrics
Nothing sounds as good as
"I remember that"
Like a bolt out from the blue
Did you feel it, too?
I remember that

Name me one little thing
You'll be wanting to keep
As you give up the ghost
As you sink into sleep
Maybe her face in the morning
Maybe his in the evening
Maybe words never spoken
Aren't they the ones worth hearing?
Say, "I remember that" (Ah)

Nothing sounds as good as
"I remember that"
Like a bolt out from the blue
Did you feel it, too?
I remember that
Nothing sounds as good as
"I remember that" (Oh)
Like a bolt out from the blue
Did you feel it, too?
I remember that
'Cause that's all we can have
Yes, it's all we can trust
It's a hell of a ride
But a journey to dust
And there's nothing pathetic
Listing clothes she'd wear
If it proves that I had you
If it proves I was there
See, I remember that (Ah)

Nothing sounds as good as
"I remember that"
Like a bolt out from the blue
Did you feel it, too?
I remember that
Nothing sounds as good as (Nothing sounds as good as)
"I remember that" (Oh-oh)
Like a bolt out from the blue (Ooh)
Did you feel it, too?
I remember that

(Did you feel it, too?)
I remember that (Oh)
(Did you feel it, too?)
I remember that
(Did you feel it, too?)
I remember that (Nothing sounds as good as)
(Did you feel it, too?)
I remember that (Yeah)
Did you feel it, too?
Like a bolt out from the blue (Ooh)
(Did you feel it, too?)
(Did you feel it, too?)
(Did you feel it, too?)
I remember that (Oh)
(Did you feel it, too?)
I remember that
(Did you feel it, too?)
(Did you feel it, too?)Embed
