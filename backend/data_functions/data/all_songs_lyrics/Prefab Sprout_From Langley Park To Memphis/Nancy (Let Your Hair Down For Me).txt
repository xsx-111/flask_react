Nancy (Let Your Hair Down For Me) LyricsWeekday mornings find me moody
I kiss my wife goodbye
I drive the boss to work each day
At the office, no one's watching
Can I catch her eye?
The hours squeeze by, the boss works late
Still I'll always wait and drive her home with me and say
Nancy, let your hair down for me
Nancy, leave the office behind, then
Nancy, let that fall off your shoulders
I'll be your husband once again
Nancy
Nancy, I don't mind I'm happy working overtime
Nancy, let your hair down for me
Nancy, leave the office behind, then
Nancy, let that fall off your shoulders
I'll be your husband once again
Nancy, let your hair down for me
Nancy, leave the office behind, then
Nancy, let that fall off your shoulders
I'll be your husband once againEmbed
