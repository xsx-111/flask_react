Knock On Wood LyricsThey didn't need a driver
They walked a thousand miles
He left her on the roadside
He thumbed himself a ride
He swore he'd never leave her
He meant it 'til he did
He swore he'd never leave her
He meant it 'til he did
Before you say you're lucky
Before you say he's good
Knock on wood
Broke you promise
Broke your word
He's climbing up a ladder
Heaven had begun
He's found another angel
She'll take him down a rung or two
She swears she'll never leave him
She means it but she will
She swears she'll never leave him
She means it but she will
Before you say you're lucky
Before you say she's good
Knock on wood
She swears she'll never leave him
She means it but she will
She swears she'll never leave him
She means it but she will
Before you say you're lucky
Before you say she's good
Knock on wood
Broke your promise
Knock on wood
Broke your word
Knock on woodEmbed
