Chemistry Lyrics
This must be the place
I can tell by your glare
I wouldn't touch you on a dare
Seven months to June
And even then, so what?
My mouth is open, my book is shut

My air guitar is out of tune
My stupid hair is so '82 to you
At least I don't fit in...

Corner me in in Chemistry
It's all just simple math to me
Call me your names, make them stick
I'll laugh until I am sick

Glad that that's all through
Got better friends than you
Just can't remember where I left them
I'll see you all in class
Not if I ditch first
Expect the best, accept the worst
Walk until your blush subsides
Drink beneath the 405 in the ivy
And think about that girl...

Two grades below
She pierced her nose way before it was cool
Some older guy with a motorbike
Picks her up after school

This school's a living hell
I work and don't get paid
I smoke a lot but can't get laid

Sit and stare, it's all we do
All my friends are broken, too
We're just waiting
Waiting to begin...

Corner me in
In Chemistry
It's all just simple math to me
Call me your names
Make them stick
I'll laugh until I am sickEmbed
