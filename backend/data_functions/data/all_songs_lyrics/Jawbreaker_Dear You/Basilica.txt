Basilica Lyrics
Sunken eyed best friend of mine
Why do you sit so still, still shaking?
Superhero sapped of all powers
I'll kneel beside you, watch you for hours
There's an angel on you
Leaning down to kiss your cheek
Feathers floating on air
This is my prayer for you

Steps of stone, morning bright blue
Stick of flame, a candle winks at you
In the pew, head down I'm crying
I think you have thoughts of dying
I'm eclipsing them now
Calling all allies down
I'm consumed by your eyes
Keep them open and full

It's raining in your room
Angel tears, bask sweet
Angel eyes on you
They love all that they see
Dewy palm, cemetery lawn
Walk alone in gardens of loss
You can't have a flower of stone
Never let this soil come between us
I'm asking you on a date for the rest of your life

It's raining in your room
Angel tears, bask sweet
Angel eyes on you
They love all that they see1Embed
