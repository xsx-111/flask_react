Save Your Generation Lyrics
I have a present: it is the present
You have to, to learn to, find it within you
If you can learn to love it, you just might like it
You can't live without it
There's a million open windows
I'm passing these open windows
Passing these open windows
There is plenty to criticize
It gets so easy to narrow these eyes
But these eyes will stay wide
I will stay young
Young and dumb inside
I have just begun to forget my lines

If you could save yourself, you could save us all
Go on living, prove us wrong
Your leap of faith could be a well-timed smile
Survival never goes out of style

I have a message: "Save your generation."
We're killing each other by sleeping in
Finnegan, begin again
This one can be won
One can become two
Two can pick and choose
You could be the first
If you could save yourself, you could save us all
Go on living, prove us wrong
Your leap of faith could be a well-timed smile
Survival never goes out of style

You have to learn to learn from your mistakes
You can afford to lose a little face
The things you break, some can't be replaced
A simple rule: every day be sure you wake

If you could save yourself, you could save us all
Go on living, prove us wrong
Your leap of faith could be a well-timed smile
Survival never goes out of styleEmbed
