Million LyricsWould that you could touch this angel in a clutch of snakes?
Oh pretty, pretty, I'm aflame
So excited, so unslept
Somewhat littered, so unswept
You have to sleep before you wake
I am spilled and poured
I am peeled and cored
I am hanging from the floor
Flicker like a freak through a sleepless week
In a black cell of forever
There's a point to this
A point I think I often miss
Oh clever, clever, where's your heart?
You can turn a phrase until it reads a million ways
It makes no sense but it's as good as it is sad
I am sad, elated
I am segregated
There's this stitching and it's itching
All my friends are dead
Asleep in distant beds
At least these enemies stay close
Take me to the pretty ones
I want to be a pretty one
Sign me to a nice girl so she can ruin me eternally
They offered me a million bucks
All I want's a steady fuck
Oh steady, steady, where were you?
Channel surf a sea of static
See the prize but you can't have it
There's something thankless in a wish fulfilled
I am thrilled and bored
I am unskilled, adored
All of both and none of one
I would kill for more
I haven't killed before
I could set this heart on stun
Take me to the pretty ones
I want to be original
Sign me to a nice girl so I can sing her something meaningful
In my perfect world I'd be signed to a nice girl
It would cost one million kissesEmbed
