Lurker II: Dark Son of Night Lyrics
Connect the cable
Have sex a lot
A hostile climate clouds and sickens you
Two room condo, treeless cul-de-sac
A nun's dark habit
All arm, no follow through

As a favor to me
As a place to go
As a favor to me
Little stitch to sew

Loose leaf paper
At a loss for words
A can of dinner
Hard to get a rise
Hook up the Sega
Have sex alone
Stick a fork in a socket
Still it's no surprise

I think I'm coming unplugged
I just scratch and shrug
Itches in my teeth
As a favor to me
I can't watch you all the time
Much as I would like to
As I think I ought to
It's hard to argue for this life
Harder still without you
Don't make me survive you

Ripe fruit falls from the tree so bare
Dead in sunshine, decomposing there
Spoiled and keeping
Keeping tracks to pick
Fitful sleeping
Were you never sick?

Another mouth to feed
As a favor to me
As a need to need
As a favor to me

I can't watch you all the time
Much as I would like to
As I think I ought to
It's hard to argue for this life
Harder still without you
Don't make me survive you
Warm and sated
The walls get interesting
Don't know what they're saying
Perhaps they're listening
So I stopped talking to hear the pins drop
I'm in the back room so I won't hear you knockEmbed
