Jet Black Lyrics
"I tell you this because as an artist I think you'll understand."

I'll be quiet to keep you quiet
Don't concern yourself with my slow dying
Through the vents I hear you sigh
I don't get too high these days
Your floor is my ceiling
Lights out, you can't come in

If you don't remind me, I won't forget you
If you don't ask, I won't upset you

I am jet black
I am stone cold
Jet black to the center
Funny like a funeral
I need you to bury me

White noise in black room dust
These hands long for one last touch
Hourglass all out of trust
I don't scratch so I won't itch
I don't reach so I won't miss
I taste our last kiss
If you don't remind me, I won't forget you
If you don't ask, I won't upset you

I am jet black
I am stone cold
Jet black to the center
Funny like a funeral
I need you to bury me

This is the cure: the same as the symptom
Simple and pure: break to keep fixing
Patiently nurse, patient and nurse
This is the part I wouldn't show you
The part where you say, "I don't even know you."
This is your cue
Be glad that it's through

I am jet black
I am stone cold
Jet black to the center
Funny like a funeral
I need you to bury me
"Sometimes when I'm driving on the road at night, I see two headlights coming toward me, fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion: the sound of shattering glass, the flames rising out of the flowing gasoline."2Embed
