Latin Love Affair LyricsAh, remind me that I've got to tell you something
'Fore the night is through
Something I know from deep within my heart
Within the questions of our love there's answers
Now I know we got to make a start
Oh, you thrill me
Never gonna let you go
You will be my Latin love affair
Now that you promise to be sweet, ah
Sugar won't be good for me
You will be my Latin love affair
You ask me if I could ever go leave you
When the chips are down
If I got some love for someone new
I'll never whisper sweet words
Like the words you're gonna hear
Remind me, girl, to tell you that I love you
Oh, you thrill me
Never gonna let you go
You will be my Latin love affair
Now that you promise to be sweet, ah
Sugar won't be good for me
You will be my Latin love affair
Arriba!
Whoo!
Oh, you thrill me
Never gonna let you go
You will be my Latin love affair
Now that you promise to be sweet, ah
Sugar won't be good for me
You will be my Latin love affair
Oh, darling, darling
Oh, you thrill me
Never gonna let you go
You will be my Latin love affair
Remind me that I've got to tell you something
'Fore the night is through
Something I know from deep within my heart
Within the questions of our love the answers clear
Now I know we got to make a start
Oh, you thrill me
Never gonna let you go
You will be my Latin love affair
Now that you promise to be sweet, ah
Sugar won't be good for me
You will be my Latin love affair
Oh, you thrill me
Never gonna let you go
You will be my Latin love affair
Now that you promise to be sweet, ah
Sugar won't be good for me
You will be my Latin love affairEmbed
