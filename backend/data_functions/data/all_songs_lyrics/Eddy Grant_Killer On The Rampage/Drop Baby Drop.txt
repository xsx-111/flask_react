Drop Baby Drop LyricsMy heart does the tango
With every little move you make
I love you like a mango
'cause we can make it everyday
I want you to drop baby, drop baby, drop
Drop all your love on me
Drop baby, drop baby, drop, drop 'cause I'm hungry
Drop baby, drop baby, drop, drop all your love on me
Drop baby, drop baby, drop, drop 'cause I'm hungry
My nights would be so lonely
If ever you should choose to go
I'd live just like a zombie
With very little love to show
I want you to drop baby, drop baby, drop
Drop all your love on me
Drop baby, drop baby, drop, drop 'cause I'm hungry
Drop baby, drop baby, drop, drop all your love on me
Drop baby, drop baby, drop, drop 'cause I'm hungry
Who loves you pretty baby
Who's gonna help you through the night
Who loves you pretty mama
Who's always there to make it right
Who loves you
Who loves you pretty baby
Who's gonna love you mama, baby drop
My heart does the tango
With every little move you make
I love you like a mango
'cause we can make it everyday
I want you to drop baby, drop baby, drop
Drop all your love on me
Drop baby, drop baby, drop, drop 'cause I'm hungry
Drop baby, drop baby, drop, drop all your love on me
Drop baby, drop baby, drop, drop 'cause I'm hungryEmbed
