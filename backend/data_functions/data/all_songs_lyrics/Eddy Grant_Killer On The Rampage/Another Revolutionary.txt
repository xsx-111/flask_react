Another Revolutionary LyricsOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Another revolutionary
God, they watch him put his ship to sea
But he can't paddle waves with his hands
The Armada's got to make a stand
Another revolutionary
God, he's fighting for us righteously
But who knows if his bullets and vest
Were ever made to stand the test
I'm-a watching him go
But my heart's not in my hand
I can feel no fair
'Cause our destiny's secure
Another revolutionary
Oh, he's fighting for us righteously
But who knows if his bullets and vest
Were ever meant to stand the test
Oh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, now
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Another revolutionary
Got to go out and I think it's me
Got to paddle the waves with my hands
The Armada's got to make a stand
I'll play no games
'Cause it takes two to do that
Won't play no game
Until I don't have to fight
Another revolutionary
Oh, they watch him put his ship to sea
But he can't paddle waves with his hands
The Armada's gotta make a stand
Another revolutionary
Oh, he's fighting for us righteously
But who knows if his bullets and vest
Were ever meant to stand the test
Oh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Another revolutionary
Fighting for his freedom
Oh he's fighting for you
Just like he's fighting for me
Another revolutionary
Sayin, its the children
Fighting all injustices
Oh, now
Can't stand to hear the children cry
Hear the children cry, oh
While they die of starvation, oh
Fighting for freedom, oh
Oh can't you see, can't you see
Can't you see
Can't you see a ship upon the horizon
And they feel they don't have a chance
Oh...
Fighting for freedomEmbed
