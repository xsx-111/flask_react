Too Young to Fall LyricsYou're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fall
You're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fall
The hunger and starvation
For love that you feel in yourself
And all the deprivation
Will pall when you see what love is
Oh, I've begged you, girl, stay outta my life
Though I've welcomed you sometimes
I wanna tell you, girl
You're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fall
You're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fall
Just one reservation
Our love won't have to stay on the shelf
Love the satisfaction
To know I'll have you soon to myself
But I want you, girl, to get that old piece of mind
Get out and be free
And one day you'll see
You're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fall
Too young, too young
Too young, too young
Too young, too young
Too young, too young
Too young, too young
Too young, too young
Too young, too young
Too young, too young
You're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fall
Oh, child, the hunger and starvation
For love that you feel in yourself
And all the deprivation
Will pall when you see what love is
Oh, I've begged you, girl, stay outta my life
Though I've welcomed you sometimes
You're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fall
You're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fallEmbed
