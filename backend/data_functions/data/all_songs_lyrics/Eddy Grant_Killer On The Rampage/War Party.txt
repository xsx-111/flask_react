War Party LyricsYou invite me to a war party, me no wanna go
Everybody seem to be inviting me to
A war party, me no wanna go
Heard about the last one, so thanks but no thank you, you
You killed off all the Indians
And you killed off all the slaves
But not quite, so you killed off the remains
You a look for me, I'm looking for you
I can't believe what they say 'bout you is true
That you're a bastard just like Pharoah
You killed the children just like Pharoah
Now you send a ticket for me
It don't have R.S.V.P
Oh Lord, it's a war party, me no wanna go
Everybody seem to be inviting me to
A war party, me no wanna go
Heard about the last one, so thanks but no thank you, you
You've invited all our wise men many time before
To dance around your fires and even out your scores
And when the tolls taken of the valiant and the brave
The only decoration is the one upon the graves
Oh, no, you're a bastard just like Pharoah
You killed the children just like Pharoah
Now you send a ticket for me
And it don't have R.S.V.P
Oh Lord, it's a war party, me no wanna go
Everybody seem to be inviting me to
A war party, me no wanna go
Heard about the last one, so thanks but no thank you, you
Please don't send no ticket for me
No, don't send no ticket
No, don't send no ticket for me
If don't have R.S.V.P
Oh Lord, it's a war party, me no wanna go
Everybody seem to be inviting me to
A war party, me no wanna go
Heard about the last one, so thanks but no
Do you wanna go, say no
Oh, do you wanna-na-na go, say no
Well, me no wanna go right now
Me no wanna go right now
They invite me to a war party, me no wanna go
Everybody seem to be inviting me to
A war party, me no wanna go
Heard about the last one, so thanks but no thank you, you
War party
Oh, me no, me no, me no, me no wanna-na go
War party, me no wanna go
Everybody seem to be inviting me to
A war party, me no wanna go...Embed
