Killer on the Rampage LyricsThere's a killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
Killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
Trying to get near, but don't you worry
Words out on the street, got his eyes on you
Trying to get there, but don't you worry
So I thought I'd let you know
I thought I'd let you know
There's a killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
Killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
Absolutely clear, but don't you worry
Ain't gonna let you go in a hurry
Even if it comes to a showdown
Well, I gotta let you know
I'm gonna fight him tooth and nail
There's a killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
Killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
Oh, yeah
No time, no time to lie down here
I got to let you know
That there ain't no space
And he's a slow gun
I'm gonna shoot him in the face
There's a killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
There's a killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
Trying to get there, don't you worry
Oh, words on the street, got his eyes on you
Trying to get there, but don't you worry
Oh, I got to let you know
I said, I got to let you know
There's a killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
Killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
Killer on the rampage
Don't feel no fear
Can't kill my love for you, a-hoo
Don't feel no fear
Killer on the rampageEmbed
