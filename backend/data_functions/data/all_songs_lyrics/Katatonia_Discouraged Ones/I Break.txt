I Break Lyrics
Sounds of imbalance
Sleeps through the never
The artificial lightsource
Is creeping with flies

And this time I break
I will never make another day
Defiant to what's delivered

I will find a way to sever myself
Exit all today, you can't see this
Did you ever say "I break, sever"
I will find a way, visit me when I'm there

The weakness of hope
Is the strength of decline
Remember what's past ways
And what I've become

And this time I break
I will never make another day
Defiant to what's delivered
The joy of not being
Is something I need
'Cause I'm only weather
But only to me

And this time I break
I will never make another day
Defiant to what's delivered

I will find a way to sever myself
Exit all today, you can't see this
Did you ever say "I break, sever"
I will find a way, visit me when I'm thereEmbed
