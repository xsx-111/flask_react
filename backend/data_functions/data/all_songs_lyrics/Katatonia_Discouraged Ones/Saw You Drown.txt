Saw You Drown Lyrics
As through your shattered eyes it all came together
And your heart cries, weeping through the weather
Another way to change your mind, I'm weaker than they say
To leave this all behind, the only way to stay

Don't you know
I'm the end of what we'll be
And right below us
The last thing you'll see

In the water I saw you drown
Down the water, saw you drown
In the water, saw you drown
Down the water I saw you drown

As through my shattered sight you're no longer here
And my heart cries, sleeping through the light
Another way to change my mind, never is the day
To leave it all behind, the only way to stay

Don't you know
I'm the end of what we'll be
And right below us
The last thing you'll see
In the water I saw you drown
Down the water, saw you drown
In the water, saw you drown
Down the water I saw you drownEmbed
