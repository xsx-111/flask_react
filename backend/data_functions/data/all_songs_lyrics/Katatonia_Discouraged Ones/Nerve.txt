Nerve Lyrics
High white ways shattered by rain
Pale dead walls, nerves pushed in pain
Red light faced, mirrors of the dead
People in the archways, eyes full of lead

Always closing down myself
Lower sights and never see
Worlds of noise and worlds of light
Expecting not to be
Not close enough for you
To hear a breath and steal a sigh
But just close enough for me
To take a step and pass you by

High white ways shattered by rain
Pale dead walls, nerves pushed in pain
Red light faced, mirrors of the dead
People in the archways, eyes full of lead

Always closing down myself
Lower sights and never see
Worlds of noise and worlds of light
Expecting not to be
Not close enough for you
To hear a breath and steal a sigh
But just close enough for me
To take a step and pass you by
Always closing down myself
Lower sights and never see
Worlds of noise and worlds of light
Expecting not to be
Not close enough for you
To hear a breath and steal a sigh
But just close enough for me
To take a step and pass you by1Embed
