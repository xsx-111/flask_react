Distrust Lyrics
Running my way towards oblivion
Inside my head electric insomnia
In your mind I'm fed with distrust
Heading for anything better than this

I want to be forgotten, I want you to forgive
How I am losing all this, it's just the way I live
I want to be forgotten, I want you to forgive
How I am losing all this, it's just the way I live

Running my way towards oblivion
Inside my head smokescreen's gone
Leaving all this to be undone
Heading for anything better than this

I want to be forgotten, I want you to forgive
How I am losing all this, it's just the way I live
I want to be forgotten, I want you to forgive
How I am losing all this, it's just the way I live

Running my way towards oblivion
Outside my head only the dark
In your mind I'm the end of it all
Heading for anything better than thisEmbed
