Stalemate Lyrics
What I am supposed to be
In my life, in your life
In our life, in this life

I shut the door and close my sight
At the end of the day

It's not the way that it used to be
There is no way I'll see
The beginning of things to come
Trapped in the ways of the silent and weak

In my life, in your life
In our life, in this life

I shut the door and close my sight
At the end of the day

It's not the way that it used to be
There is no way I'll see
The beginning of things to come
Trapped in the ways of the weak
I shut the door and close my sight
At the end of the day

It's not the way that it used to be
There is no way I'll see
The beginning of things to come
Trapped in the ways of the weakEmbed
