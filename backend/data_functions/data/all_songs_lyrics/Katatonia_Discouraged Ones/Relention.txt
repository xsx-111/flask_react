Relention Lyrics
It's hard to say where I've been
Or am, sleeping in the dark
I don't know where I live
Dirty palace walls

I'm returning from something to something to something
I'm returning from something to something to something
I'm returning from something to something to something
I'm returning from something to something, guess I'm alright

It's hard to say where I've been
Or am, sleeping in the dark
I don't know where I live
Dirty splintered palace walls

I'm returning from something to something to something
I'm returning from something to something to something
I'm returning from something to something to something
I'm returning from something to something, guess I'm alrightEmbed
