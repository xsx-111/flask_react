Dust LyricsDust from your skin must . . . trust
When it scatters
Only love matters
It's been overjoyed
Scents and perfumes wince . . . since
Your higher fragrance
Is memory incense
And never destroyed
Every stop we've taken
Is now a wondrous shrine
Where nature is in order
Your senses sensing mine
As I love you . . . all the creatures play
As I love you . . . now it's safe to say
There's no hang-up in our way
The trees in our gaze, will show us the love that we bring them
This shouldn't amaze, they openly love all they are, and loves all they are
Gifts to begin, lifts . . . cliffs
Of expression
They soothe our impression to every whim
Taste past our thirst faced . . . waste
Beyond uses
With so many juices
We're filled to the brim
Our pleasures not forsaken, we cultivate our bend
More chances reawaken, when beginning meets the end
As I love you, now it's safe to say
There's no hang-up in our way
As I love you
The faith that we build, will strengthen our close growing closer
Till waiting is filled, we simply remember we are, wherever we are
Clay that we print may . . . stay
As we mold it
But we'll never hold it, to promises long
Till we're complete will . . . still
Is intention
We still need attention to help us alongEmbed
