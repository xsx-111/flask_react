She Lives (In a Time of Her Own) LyricsShe lives, no fear, doubtless in everything she knows
Through time, unchecked, the sureness of her flows
She leaves her-self inside you when she goes
She lives in a time of her own
You have always heard her speaking
She's been always in your ear
Her voice sounds a tone within you
Listen to the words you hear
Her time has no past or future
She lives every thing she sees
Her time doesn't spin outside her
It's in every breath she breathes
Her love whips hard like wind and stabs in eager pains
She wins your thoughts and drives your inner planes
She clears and shares a love that never drains
She lives in a time of her own
You have always heard her speaking
She's been always in your ear
Her voice sounds a tone within you
Listen to the words you hear
Her time has no past or future
She lives every thing she sees
Her time doesn't spin outside her
It's in every breath she breathes
Her eyes like light reflect the aura of her hair
She sends, attends, behind an alpha stare
She seeks the stars and spirals up their stair
She lives in a time of her own
She lives in a time of her own
She lives in a time of her ownEmbed
