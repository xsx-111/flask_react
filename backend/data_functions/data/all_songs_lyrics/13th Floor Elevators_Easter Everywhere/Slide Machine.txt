Slide Machine LyricsWell I've been down south
Where they use the slide machine
Where the gods of gold are heard
But seldom seen
And here I've been
Just stuck up in between
Tryin' to tryin to
Tryin' to get back to you
Tryin' to tryin to
Tryin' to get back to you
Well the slide machine it sweeps stones
Right off the road
For the tandem trucks
And the loads that they towed
And me I just been lookin
For one goin' slow
Tryin' to tryin to
Tryin' to get back to you
Tryin' to tryin to
Tryin' to get back to you
My woman here she's got a dozen names
She's sought by soldiers
And they try to keep her tame
But her rewards will leave them just the same
Tryin' to tryin to
Tryin' to get back to you
Tryin' to tryin to
Tryin' to get back to you
Well I've been down south
Where they use the slide machine
Where the gods of gold are heard
But seldom seen
And here I've been
Just stuck up in between
Tryin' to tryin to
Tryin' to get back to you
Tryin' to tryin to
Tryin' to get back to youEmbed
