Nobody to Love LyricsIn her eyes there quaked a smile
Cascading to the shore
And then her words like golden birds
Flew above the thunder's roar
And then her voice was echoing
Through the night no more
And I remember all her dreams
And all the words before
She knew the sun was shining
She knew the moon was shining
She knew her eyes were finding mine
She knew the sun would come
And it would shine for us all day
And burning bright its morning light
Would flood us with the day
Nobody to love
Nobody to love
Nobody to love
Nobody to love
Nobody to love
Nobody to love
Nobody to love
Nobody
And now I'm faced with midnight
And nobody to love
There isn't even twilight
With nobody to love
She left me in the wilderness
Where all I have is cold
She left me only loneliness
Useless as gold
And now I've got no one to hold
She knew the sun would come
And it would shine for us all day
And burning bright its morning light
Would flood us with the dayEmbed
