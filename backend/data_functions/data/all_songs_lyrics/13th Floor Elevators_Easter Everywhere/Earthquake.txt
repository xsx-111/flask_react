Earthquake LyricsThe sound of the earthquake
The rhythms that you make
Are makin' my head shake in two
Magnetized by you
The love you pull me through
You pull through earth and stone
You pull through flesh and bone
The sounds of the earthquake
The movements that you make
Are shakin' my head right in two
You know our worlds never leaving
In each other we're believing
Loss will never catch us grieving
Love won't go away
We command it to stay
Every turn our fate is taking
All around the ground is breaking
We're safe it's the love we're making
It won't fly apart
From the beat of our heart
Like the ground in
The sound of the Earthquake
And the rhythms that you make
You're makin' it shakes my head in two
Rivers waves reverse their course
The planet sways beneath our force
Canyons mountain we just shrug
We keep our cool inside our hug
Through the massive walls that hit us
Our loves' power will never quit us
No result can ever split US in two
The sound of the Earthquake
The exchanges that we make
Are takin' my head right into you
You know our worlds never leaving
In each other we're believing
Loss will never catch us grieving
Love won't go away
We command it to stay
Every turn our fate is taking
All around the ground is breaking
We're safe in the love we're making
It won't fly apart
From the beat of our heart
Like the ground in
The sound of the Earthquake
The rhythms that you make
You're makin' it shakes my head in two
Magnetized by you
The love you pull me through
You pull through earth and stone
You pull through flesh and bone
The sounds of the earthquake
And the rhythms that you make
Are shakin' my head right in two
(Right in two)
The sounds of...
Yeah!Embed
