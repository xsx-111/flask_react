Postures (Leave Your Body Behind) LyricsYou're moving, keep climbing
You're moving, keep climbing
If you're wonderin' what's on your mind
It's the one keystone people keep tryin' to find
The state of mind that puts you there
In evolutions everywhere
Is creeping back from the affair
So leave, leave, leave your body behind
Leave, leave, leave, leave your body behind
Yes, yes, yes, you always come back
To live the desire you want on your track
Live the love, it gives its returns
The higher you're living now the purer it burns
So keep climbing, move your energies higher
So keep climbing, your sun catches on fire
So keep climbing and bathe in the sun
That dawns in the darkness once the journey's begun
Remember, remember why can't you remember?
Remember that we're fallen, indifference from the love
It's only habit circumstance
It fits you like a glove
Remember that we're callen in every cast of words
It's spoken in the voices, of the holy sound you've heard
You've got to remember, remember
Your form can move, your shape is composed of edges
Your form you can move
The edges or ridges of your own Energy
Your own Energy, your own Energy
Just emotion you feel
In your wandering in search for this
Only highest existence, consciousness and bliss
By feeling more love for the sense world you're seeing
You raise your sense income and your level of being
By finer and finer and finer agreeing
You leave . . . leave, leave
Leave your body behind
Leave, Leave, Leave, leave your body behind
Yes, yes, yes, attention comes back
You focus on anchors to have what you lack
Live the love each thought form returns
And weighs in the judgment of the ether than burns
So keep climbing, move your energies higher
Keep on climbing, your sun catches on fire
Keep climbing, the sun fills so soon
And gathers the clouds into a heavenly moon
Remember, remember, why can't you remember?
Remember, we're bombarded
The downpour of the world
The outside meanings lock us in
So all else seems absurd
Remember things regarded, are terminals like you
Thought terminals discharge against each other
And balance siphoning through
You've got to remember, remember
Your form can move, your shape is composed of edges
Your form you can move
Your edges are ridges of your own energy
Your own energy, your own energy
Just emotion you feel
Make your body like dry wood
Your heart like cooled ashes
The light strains through your near-closed eyes
Like ribbons through your lashes
It ripples down with your hearts clear
You're mixed into the voices ear
The love you feel is love you hear
You leave, leave, leave
Leave your body behind
Leave, leave, leave, leave your body behind
Remember, remember, rememberEmbed
