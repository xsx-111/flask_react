I Had to Tell You LyricsChaos all around me
With its fevered clinging
But I can hear you singing
In the corners of my brain
Every doubt that bounds me
Every sound of riot
Everything is quiet
But the song that keeps me sane
I can hear your voice, echoing my voice softly
I can feel your strength, reinforcing mine
If you fear I'll lose my spirit
Like a drunkard's wasted wine
Don't you even think about it, I'm feeling fine
I can hear your voice, echoing my voice softly
I can feel your strength, reinforcing mine
If you fear I'll lose my spirit
Like a drunkard's wasted wine
Don't you even think about it, I'm feeling fineEmbed
