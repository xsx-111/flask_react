Odessa Lyrics
Ah, tis but a dainty flower I bring to you
Yes, tis but a violet glistening with dew
So in our heart our love for you lies unrevealed

A stale romance and the solitude we share
Have dragged you to the beach to find me there
Every promise undone glittering in the sun
In the golden sway of violence
That morning you came and you stood in disbelief
In longing and shame
The presentiment of grief
To forgive and to define this treachery of mine
You took off your clothes in silence

This sweet blue secrecy, the demands of destiny

Now who will serve your pleasure, who will serve your greed?
Now that the men you treasured belong to the fleet
And watch the morrows tide, that frail and beautiful bride
What a very strange season this is
From the tender axe of springtime, defying the snows
To the streaming summers, hatchet she rose
Now all covered with lime under an indifferent sky
We smother everything in kisses
Will we know eternity? Will we forge a way to see?
Will we know eternity? Will we forge a way to see?
Porque te debo, cada ataque aprendido, cada batalla
Porque te debo, cada ataque aprendido, que en la lucha te di

Who will serve your pleasure, who will serve your greed?
Now that the men you treasured belong to the fleet
And watch the morrows tide, that frail and beautiful bride
What a very strange season this is
From the tender axe of springtime, defying the snows
To the streaming summers, hatchet she rose
Now all covered with lime under an indifferent sky
We smother everything in kisses
Oh, we smother everything in kisses
(Porque te debo, cada ataque aprendido, cada batalla)
Oh, we smother everything in kisses
(Porque te debo, cada ataque aprendido, que en la lucha te di)Embed
