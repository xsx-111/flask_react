A Legacy Of Unrest LyricsMaster, I praise you
I've come here to tame
The demands of the flesh
I've come to forget my name
We all thought that the moon
Should be turned, turned to blood
And that it's the worst thing
To want for one who comes not
But there's nothing left than to obey
All of their laws of wealth
Always fighting on both sides
No denial, no denial
Master, I serve you
And I serve the language
Of failure and doubt
I've come to sell you my anguish
We all thought that the moon
Should be turned, turned to blood
And that it's the worst thing
To try to please and please not
But there's nothing left than to obey
All of their laws of wealth
Always fighting on both sides
No denial, no denial
Yes, there's nothing left than to obey
All of their laws of wealth
Master, are you taking sides?
No denial, no denial
And it feels like spring again
We've sealed this feel again
Though you tried to blind me
I still saw you blush
And it feels like spring again
We've sealed this feel again
Though you tried to blind me
Though you tried to blind me
We do not pause, we do not rest (And it feels like spring again)
So do not speak, please do not test (We've sealed this feel again)
My nerve like this (Though you tried to blind me)
In a season like this (I still saw you blush)
We do not pause, we do not rest (And it feels like spring again)
So do not speak, please do not test (We've sealed this feel again)
My nerve like this (Though you tried to blind me)
In a season like this (You tried to blind me)
We do not pause, we do not rest (You tried to blind me)
So do not speak, please do not test (You tried to blind me)
My nerve like this  (You tried to blind me)
In a season like this (You tried to blind me)Embed
