Swords To Rust - Hearts To Dust LyricsWe shall let our songs drown
The rattle of the train
And the roaring of the crowd
We shall wet our throat with sticky dark wine
And toast this blood wedding so fine
To new horizons! to a new dawn!
To a new and reckless generosity!
For this our land of the free
We shall win, die or betray and turn
Swords to rust - hearts to dust
In vain to write our name
In blood and in flowers of flame
Swords to rust - hearts to dust
All blind and gone astray
Our envy green as may
All smothered in wild flowers
We break the windows to breathe
That golden dawn is ours
For tonight hesitation is on leave
To wear god down
To flatten him out
To pray to no other
Parley with death
To bury the crown
To silence all lovers
We shall turn
Swords to rust - hearts to dust
In vain to write our name
In blood and in flowers of flame
Swords to rust - hearts to dust
All blind and gone astray
Our envy green as may
Schwerter zu rost herzen zu staub!
Dennoch die schwerter halten
Dennoch die herzen spalten
Swords to rust - hearts to dust
In vain to write our name
In blood and in flowers of flame
Swords to rust - hearts to dust
All blind and gone astray
Our envy green as mayEmbed
