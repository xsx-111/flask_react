Flowers From Exile LyricsI shall ask you for forgiveness
For all the things that i have done
I should have known better
But i won’t ask for love nor shelter
Think of me as the one to remain unknown
For more than i you have been a face to hide
You have become a name to forget
Would you ever surrender?
We stay far from you who wait petrified
Inside your countries fortified
Your dread of the deep
So unlike our dread of sleep
You won’t quench this glow
You won’t stem this tide
For your conventions are ruin
Your tools are death to me
So how dare you molest the seas
You masters of deceit
Are you still surprised
At how our pain dissolves into sound
Into one voice
At this our loneliness more verdict than choice
More than i you have been a face to hide
You have become a stain to forget
A shame to reject
So nevermind
All our fears, all our tears
Oh, no, nevermind
...the flowers we send you!Embed
