Scary Kids Scaring Kids LyricsI watch you hold it above your head
A web of broken shatters up
It all collapsed
As you clasped your own little piece of nothing
You claim as your own
Bite off your foot now
You chump
Bite off your foot for a little something to claim as your own
Finally your little trophy
Try to buy back the freedom you sold so quick
You chump
You're chomping on what's mine
Your practice perfected by practice
There's implications to your imitations
You got your art down to a science
You broke my art down to a science
Turn your back on your stagecoach and sale away
You don't tickle my gut with your pennyluck
Ugly Abe ain't nothingEmbed
