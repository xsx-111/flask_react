Olerud LyricsCatholic bad boy in a good boy suit
Central Illinois 1962
Red angry already
Hasn't even met me yet
Just do what's just to do
Gonna gotta go on and get a lotta
What I'm doing here
What I'm doing
What I am
Disconnected, locked out
A fuzzy melted chocolate bar in your pocket
Gonna gotta go on and get a lotta
What I'm doing here
What I'm doing
What I am
I inherited hard boiled eyes
It's like you finally realize how lucky you really are to have had a few great heartbreaksEmbed
