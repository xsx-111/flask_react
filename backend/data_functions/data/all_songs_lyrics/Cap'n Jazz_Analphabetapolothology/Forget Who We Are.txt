Forget Who We Are LyricsI can't stand standing here like this
And I can't take taking any of this talk serious
I can't stand standing here like this
And I can't take taking any of your talk serious
Swimming eyes and spitting whys splitting ties we realize
Missed kisses blown through blue night air
Walking you home with a bottle of boones between us
We're trying so hard to forget who we areEmbed
