AOK LyricsSo I said, "I guess things are alright"
Sternly he replied, "you just sit tight kid"
One thing still bothered me, but I never did bother to ask
I couldn't figure out the words
Expressions and words
They're nothing but letters
Emotionally illiterate
Severely inarticulate
I don't know how to tell and I don't know how to ask
But I'm alright
Am I sheltered?
Am I trapped?
Was I saved and if so why?
Why did I get this chance?
Will I be able to use it right?
I might blow up sometimes but you know things are alright
I might complain and bitch but you know my answer never changes
Everything's alright
In the world you made I'm doing aokEmbed
