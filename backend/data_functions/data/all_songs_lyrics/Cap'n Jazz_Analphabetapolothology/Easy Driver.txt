Easy Driver Lyrics
My smock

Stains so deep they can see no end
Stains so many they can hardly be seen
Wrinkles like gashes and dirt formed shadows
My fingers swim for the end of a sleeve

And I can't understand
It's just my dad's old shirt
It fit him so well
Starched rigid, firmly creased
He grew into it and it grew into him
Now I can't hear myself through all the sounds in my head
They all tell me exactly what I want

He grew into it and it grew into him

Call me Tetris
I've got the headache
Nothing fits and nothing disappears
Call me Tetris
I've got the headache
Nothing fits and nothing disappears
I can't close my eyes on it
What do you mean my favorite color is black?
It's always been green
It's black
Green and blue, just like when the sky hits the leafy treetops
What should we name it?Embed
