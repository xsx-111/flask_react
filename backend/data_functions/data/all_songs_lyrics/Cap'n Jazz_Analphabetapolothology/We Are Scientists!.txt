We Are Scientists! LyricsCotton preshrunk displays games we play
Colors run and colors fade
I can't pick a side to pick a fight on
It's more of me than I am of it
I can't win
I can't win
I can't win
I can't win
I can't win
Now my tongue has tangled me toothless
And we don't have a thought between us
In this one light room in this neon museum the walls itch in closer
I remember every conversation
I remember everything
I forgot to have
Starchy retort scripted questions I never cared to ask about
Starchy product scripted people I never asked to care about
I can't win
My skin was shrinking when she told me don't worry honey
You can't look at the sky without looking right through itEmbed
