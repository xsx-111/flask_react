Soria LyricsI've gobbled all the peels
I discard the fruit
I'm the only one left here and I'm a sour patch kid
Something about here is making me hate me
Something about here is making me hate me
Something I can't put my finger on
Something I can't put my fist through
It's not like this is what I'm trying to do
It's not something to prove or nothing better to do
No reason to stay is a good reason to goEmbed
