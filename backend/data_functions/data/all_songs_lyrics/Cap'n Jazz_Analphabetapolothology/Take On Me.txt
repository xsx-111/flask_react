Take On Me Lyrics
Ba-da-ba-da-ba

We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's isn't my day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, I'm sorry

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
Without
You!

So needless to say
Of odds and ends
That you find are strolling away
To prove you that life is OK
Say it after me
Is it better to be safe than sorry?
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
Without you

(Ba-da-ba-da-ba)

Oh the things that you say
Are they just a lie to keep my worries away
You're everything I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
Without You! (Take on me)
Take me on
I'll be gone (Is it better to be safe than sorry!)1Embed
