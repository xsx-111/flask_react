Puddle Splashers LyricsWe're busy touching till we're dizzy stupid
We're busy touching till we're dizzy stupid
We're busy touching till we're dizzy stupid
I am a puppy, a balloon, and a happy accident
Missed she teaching me myths mistold
Hold me here dearest and turn me gold
And I watched you holding up the sun
I remember her saying
"This whole world is a waste of my time"
All I could say is
"I wish I had something to say"
If we stand still long enough
The sun will move around us
You can't look at the sky without looking right through itEmbed
