Rocky Rococo LyricsNorman fell, pick him up
Mr. Ropers I'm Mr. Roped
Please don't push, I'm so scared
Everybody's so good looking in the republic banana
I couldn't miss your billboard
I recognized your logo
But I must've missed your alibi
I've been humming your jingle
I've been chanting your slogan
But I must've missed your alibi
If I could do anything
If I could do anything in your world I'd be doing nothingEmbed
