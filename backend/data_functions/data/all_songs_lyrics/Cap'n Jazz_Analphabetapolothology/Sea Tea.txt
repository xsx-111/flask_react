Sea Tea LyricsGroans grow
Growing out a horizon groin
Growing from the selfish joys of a quiet, ill reputed boy
Groans roam and skip like when in Rome
Roaming between what we build and what grows on its own
And I can't pinpoint who's the pinner

The bower
You f*cking coward
Standing behind the front
Spine timely unspinely
I watch you watch your watch as I ramble on
'Bout when I was in front
Maybe I just want to want toEmbed
