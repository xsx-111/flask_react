Geheim LyricsThe kid plays switch stance
He's so un-situated
Giggling girls
His hair curls
I know he knows I know he's overrated
Displaced in his placement
Tripped up in a statement
I'm not like him
That kid, he plays switch stance
Opening everything leaves nothing open
He'll keep justifying
He knows I'll continue to bitch
You're not wrong
I'm not right
I'm not wrong
You're not right
Show me your face
What's your faceEmbed
