Troubled by Insects LyricsHis lips smack (I'll do anything)
A global splendor of gluttony
He's got a smile (I'll do anything)
Like he was born to be president
You ask about politics I answer
It's all about people
Let's spit for territories
Split up the not enough to go around
Just let me keep all these wants I need
I'll do whatever you want me to
You present your presence (I'll do anything)
Like grabby gift day presents
We all suck (I'll do anything)
Your bloated white bread fill but I'm still always starving
You ask about people and I tell you
We're all fucked on the inside
Let's spit for territories
Split up the not enough to go around
Just let me keep all these wants I need
I'll do whatever you tell me to
I'm doing all you told me
Get your world off my back
I've been stuffed fat and pounded fat
I've shrunken it
I've sunk in it
I've drowned in all I've found in itEmbed
