Sergio Valente LyricsThey wouldn't understand
It's a passionate youth thing
Amy the victim, the victimizer
I understand
They make it so hard
Amy the product, the producer
I know it's hard
Tangled by hard copy
Classmates called you a loner
Can't blame you for bragging
38 is an impressive age
Amy, I'm sorry
You're the poster child for all of our angst
They say only you're to blame
We're all the same
We're just like you
Amy, I'm sorry
But it had to be one of usEmbed
