Catfish LyricsO'Keefe
Sittin' by the water
Starin' at the stream
Tell me, honey, are there any
Catfish in your dreams
Catfish ain't expensive
Neither is it free
Some folks crazy 'bout it
Others have to leave it be
Suckers and bullheads
Never will do
But a catfish'll show you
A thing or two
If you go down to the bank
So you can flash your bait
If you're lookin' for catfish, mama
You ain't got long to wait
Catfish got whiskers
And a sweet little grin
But you never can tell
Where a catfish has been
I'll be your catfish
Any old time
Just call out my name
And drop me your lineEmbed
