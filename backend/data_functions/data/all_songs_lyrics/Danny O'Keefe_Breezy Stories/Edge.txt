Edge LyricsO'Keefe
The harlot hounded harlequin
As he eyed her with mistrust
I still call it love, he said
You don't even call it lust
They calmly talked it over
And agreed to disagree
He maintained her love was priceless
She maintained her love was free
She asked him, "Baby, would you like to come with me?"
The money's just for the room, babe
The love is free
You need wings to get to heaven
Oh, to hell, you just need balls
It's a very rough trip
There ain't no place to fall
It's just like freeway traffic
From the womb to the tomb
For this short time together
We need a little room
And then she showed him what she thought he'd come to see
The money's just for the room, babe
The love is free
The harlot hounded harlequin
Till he realized at last
That when you pay to play
The game of love gets pretty fast
They had a lot in common
So they smiled and shared a smoke
The harlot saw life is a trick
The harlequin, a joke
And then he showed her what she'd really come to be
The money's just for the room, babe
The love is freeEmbed
