Magdalena LyricsO'Keefe
Magdalena sits in her chair speaking of the mass
She talks in splice and splinters, she laughs like breaking glass
She says that she would have me, spirit her away
Stealing all my images, till there's nothin' left to say
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor, my heart is just a scar
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
She tells me that she wants me then she tells me not to bother
She tells me that I couldn't hold a candle to her father
She knows that she's got me when I start to rave about
And she'll just smile and flash her eyes and blow the candle out
Oh, Magdalena
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Magdalena lying there could make a dancer stumble
Make a preacher bite his tongue and leave him with a mumble
And if you think I'm crazy babe or that I'm funning you
Just pay your dues and lose your blues when she gets her tongue in you
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor, my heart is just a scar
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
I can't be forgotten and I can't be ignored
You find me with my poems and my songs
But if upon your journey you're turning to L.A
Won't you take this little red-haired girl along?
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor, my heart is just a scar
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you areEmbed
