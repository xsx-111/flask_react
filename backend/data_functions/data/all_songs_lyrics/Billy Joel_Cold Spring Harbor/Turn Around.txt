Turn Around Lyrics
Oh, sweet lady
Runnin' like a stream
You don't look back because you know your hands are clean
You make believe
That the past was just a dream
You make believe the past was just a dream

Turn around
Turn around
And I will sing for you a song
I don't know where you been
But you been gone too long

Oh, Eliza
You must begin again
And all the roads that you have walked are comin' to an end
I was your lover
But I thought I was your friend
I loved you but I thought I was your friend

Turn around
Turn around
And I will sing for you a song
I don't know where you been
But you been gone too long
Oh, sweet lady
Stand beside the sea
Maybe you will find a little time to think of me
Won't you please remember
What I tried so hard to be?
Yeah, remember what I tried so hard to be

Turn around
Turn around
And I will sing for you a song
I don't know where you been
But you been gone too long

Too long
I said, you been gone too long
You been gone too long
Da da da, da da da, ohEmbed
