A Whole Lotta Woman LyricsI've got a rocking chair that rocks
A rubber ball that rolls
I need a whole lot of woman
To satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman yeah
To satisfy my soul
You know a boy needs a girl
She needs a ring that's made of gold
But I need a whole lot of woman, yeah
To satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman
To satisfy my soul
I don't need no woman
I don't need her cause she's fine
I need a girl
A sweet little thing
To love me all of the time
You know fire makes me a hot
And ice keep 'em cold
But I need a whole lot of woman
To satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman
To satisfy my soulEmbed
