The Twist LyricsCome on baby, let's try that twist
Come on baby, let's try that twist
Let me take you by the hand honey
And it goes like this
All you got to do is, go round
Everybody's doing it, baby, go round
Mother's just sleeping
Daddy ain't around
Mother's upstairs sleeping
Daddy ain't around
We're gonna twist, that's twistin
Till we tear the house down
One more time
Go round
Oh you're looking good to me
Go round
Everybody twisting
Don't be ashamed
Go round
One more time
You should see my little miss
You should see my little sis
She ain't very old
But she's trying to do that twist
Look at her trying to go around
She's going around
Everybody's going around and around
Round and round
Around and aroundEmbed
