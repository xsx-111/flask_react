Camptown Twist LyricsNow the camptown ladies they sing this song (doo dah)
They say the camptown racetrack five miles long
I've come down here to see the horses run
And if I don't make money I'll have some fun
Because we're gonna twist all night
We're gonna twist all day
If I don't make some money I'll have some fun
Twisting the night away
Now the longtailed filly and the big black horse
They tried too take a shortcut and couldn't get across
The black horse stick in a big muddy hole
And the filly wound up around a ten foot pole
I don't care
We're gonna twist all night
We're gonna twist all day
If I don't make some money I'll have some fun
Twisting the night away
You oughtta seem them fly on the ten mile heat
They go round the racetrack and then repeat
Now I win my money and the bobtailed neck
I'm gonna keep my money in an old shoebag
We're gonna twist all night
We're gonna twist all day
Since I done won this money I'm gonna have some fun
Twisting the night away
We're gonna twist all night
We're gonna twist all day
Since I done won this money I'm gonna have some fun
Twisting the night awayEmbed
