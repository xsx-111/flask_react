Soothe Me LyricsSoothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know your powerful love is
Soothing to me
Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know your powerful love is
Soothing to me
Oh how I used to ramble
And how I used to roam
Oh but since I met that baby of mine
All I do is stay at home
And I tell her:
Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know your powerful love is
Soothing to me
Oh, I used to have a lot of girls
Have them big and small
Oh, but since I met that baby of mine
I know no other girls at all
I just tell her
Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know your powerful love is
Soothing to me
It's so soothing to me
Your love, babe, is soothing to meEmbed
