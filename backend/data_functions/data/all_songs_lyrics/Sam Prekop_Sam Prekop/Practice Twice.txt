Practice Twice LyricsPlease don't believe it's true
Splendid thoughts lost on you
I had a lovely day
Wasting time, just in case
Don't play the graceful sway
Luck be tore down this way
Please don't believe it's true
So much time lost with you
Number one, two
Try to see
Practice twice
Sure looks nice
Try to see
Don't be late, all my time
Don't be late, all my time
Some other time, bet you're gonna be
Some other time with me
Some other time, bet you're gonna be
Some other time with me
Some other time, bet you're gonna be
Some other time with meEmbed
