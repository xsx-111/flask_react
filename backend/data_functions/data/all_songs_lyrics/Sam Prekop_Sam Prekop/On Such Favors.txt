On Such Favors LyricsSay you've done talking
Do something
Shadows painted on these eyes
Together on my favorite avenue
There's nothing left to do
If it's alright
I hope it rains
On such favors
These gossips
I knew from the start
Come over
Two eyes
These arms
A pair of hands
I wake up
Just in case
I'll do something
If it's alright
I hope it rains
On such favors
These gossips
Knew from the start
Don't find me so lucky
Don't say you're mine all the time
Say you've done talking
Do something
I'll do anything you wantEmbed
