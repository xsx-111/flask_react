The Shadow LyricsSo far from  down here
Too far, I don't want to stay
Crossed off of nothing sun
Laughing all this time
We don't believe our eyes
The rivers run back and forth
I'll play it on these memories
Come on, find me

This year of experts fail
Laughing all this time
On with the season silent
Features contact down here
I gather all my silence
Features 
I soak up 
Come on, find me
Don't you know my 
Slow motion I get by
I fell apart this morning
Come on, find me
Doo da do do da doo...Embed
