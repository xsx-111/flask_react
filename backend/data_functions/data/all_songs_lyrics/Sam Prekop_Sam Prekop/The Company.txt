The Company LyricsYou know what I'm missing, do say
I would have been forced to telephone, but it's nothing
Frail and mystic, automatic
The orchestra's dreaming, the war begins
You know what I'm missing, do say
Handle carefully all night
Can't you get further? Don't upset those eyes
I'm never going to find the time to get off the wrong side
Have you heard them say? I've given it lots of thought
Entertainers down here, the orchestra's dreaming
On something down here
You know what I'm missing, do say
You know what I'm missing, so all at the same time
You know what I'm missing all night
You know what I'm missing, all fantasize
You know what I'm missing, do say
I'm gonna say, gonna slow down
You know what I'm missing1Embed
