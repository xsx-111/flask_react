So Shy LyricsSo shy, but I'm so far
Hey, bada baba
And it's so just alright now
Hey, bada baba
And so even better
Hey, bada baba
Sunshine that is so fine
Hey, bada baba
Save a little bit, you need more time
Had another chance, but I'll see you soon
Finally at dawn of some fine day
Crazy, but I'm doubtful about tomorrowEmbed
