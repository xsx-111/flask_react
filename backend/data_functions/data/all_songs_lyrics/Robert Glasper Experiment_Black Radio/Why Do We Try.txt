Why Do We Try LyricsOh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Do I continue living by myself
Living the single life till my last breath
You know I've found someone to fulfil all my needs
Why do we have to question how it should be, yeah, yeah
So why do we try to let love pass us by?
Question how we feel, the love that's not real
Do I continue living by myself?
Living the single life to my last breath
I know I've found someone to fulfil all my needs
Why do we have to question how it should be
So why do we try to let love pass us by?
Question how we feel, the love that's not real
So why do we try to let love pass us by?
We question how we feel, that love is not for real
Oh no
Why? Uh
Why do, why do, why do
Is right there underneath your nose!
Look to your left
Look to your right
Open your eyes!
Why do we try?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why?Embed
