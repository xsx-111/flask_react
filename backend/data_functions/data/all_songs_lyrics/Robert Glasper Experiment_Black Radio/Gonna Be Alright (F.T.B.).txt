Gonna Be Alright (F.T.B.) Lyrics
Just bring me the sunshine, with your smile
I'll be okay
No matter if the rain falls, if you call
I'll be okay
Just bring me the sunshine with your smile
I'll be okay
No matter if the rain falls, you call
I'll be okay

It's gonna be alright, I know it's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, with you I know I'll be okay
It's gonna be alright, I know it's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, with you I know I'll be okay

Just bring me the sunshine with your smile
(Your love brings hapiness, with you I'll do my best)
I'll be okay
No matter if the rain falls, you call
(No matter if the rain keeps falling, it's gonna be okay soon)
I'll be okay
Just bring me the sunshine with your smile
(Your love brings hapiness, with you I'll do my best)
I'll be okay
No matter if the rain falls, you call
(No matter if the rain keeps falling, it's gonna be okay soon)
I'll be okay
It's gonna be alright, I know it's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, with you I know I'll be okay
It's gonna be alright, I know it's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, with you I know I'll be okay
Can be 
I don't care long as I'm with you
Oh, it's gonna be alright
Give me 
I don't care long as I'm with you
I wanna be with you, I know I'm gonna be okay
Be alright, be okay
Be alright, ohh
