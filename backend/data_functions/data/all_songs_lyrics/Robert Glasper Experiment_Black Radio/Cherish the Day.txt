Cherish the Day Lyrics
Cherish the day
Won't go astray
Won't be afraid
Won't catch me running

You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air, yeah
You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer
If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven

I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running

You're ruling the way that I move
Only you can rescue me
This is my prayer
If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven
I cherish the day
(Cherish the day)
I won't go astray
(Won't go astray)
I won't be afraid
(I won't be afraid)
You won't catch me running
(Won't catch me running)
I cherish the day
(Cherish the day)
I won't go astray
(Won't go astray)
I won't be afraid
(I won't be afraid)
You won't catch me running
(Won't catch me running)
