Ah Yeah LyricsAh yeah
I think beauty's overrated
Cause that's something anyone can be
Attraction now that's something different, ah-huh
And thankfully you're both to me
Chorus:
Cause I've learned
In this life
You gotta be with someone you like
And if you think
We've got
What it takes to go the distance
I can tell you now
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah
Chrisette:
You're sweet
And you see through me
You let me be free
I'm woman, I'm woman
The only one I'll be
The only one you'll ever need
And you're the very same for me
Chorus:
Cause I've learned
In this life
You gotta be with someone you like
And if you think
We've got
What it takes to go the distance
I can tell you now
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah
Things can get so real in love
You gotta know exactly how you feel in love
Cause if you don't then maybe you might find
Love could be all in your mind
Ah yeah (repeat)Embed
