Move Love Lyrics
Hey, back to the beginning of time
No, nothing nowhere nor no one to find
We follow the moonlight
Chase after the sun
Searching for some piece of mind
Searching for the silver line

Stop, turn, look and see
Pause, breathe, run and dream
Stay strong, live and lead
Move love across seas
Seas
Seas
Seas
Stop, turn, look and see
Pause, breathe, run and dream
Stay strong, live and lead
Move love across seas
Seas
Seas
Seas
Seas
Seas
Seas
