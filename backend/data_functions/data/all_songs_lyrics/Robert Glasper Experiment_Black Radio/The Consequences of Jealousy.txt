The Consequences of Jealousy Lyrics
"So, for these next few minutes, submerge your mind
Peace is filling your mind"
"Try to visualize in your mind adventure"

I offer you my
Sweet devotion
I—wanna try to make it
Easier for you, I reach for you
In sweet devotion

Here and now
Here and now
Don't waste my time
On reasons you can't fight

Lay down with you—sweet devotion, ah
Sweet devotion
I'm not perfect, but my aim is true, oh

Be here and now
(Here) Here and now
Don't waste my time
On reasons you can't fight
"—your mind—"
"Listen"
"Listen"
"—into reality"
"Listen"
"—into reality"

When you learn
I'll be gone
Tears for you?
No tears for you
