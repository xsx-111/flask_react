An Apology Lyrics
This is what I know
The canopy loss of our home
Is a far cry, while I'm away
Tethered to finding a rope
We walk in precarious ways
And go alone at night
To Misery's bed
In Misery's bed, we stay
So far away
So far away
So far away

Here in the tremble and pulse
With the rush and the weight of the world
I am a cannibal, known
Begging the lashes to break
You find me awake in a dream
A scream in the dark, so it seems
Or is that just how it leaves?
The shadow I cast now the breeze
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away

So this is how it goes
With the loss of our canopy home
That falls with the leaves from the trees
As we pass
And I wasn't there in the last
But I was surely there from the first
Here, in my chest where you burst
I keep the crush
And the weight of the world
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far awayEmbed
