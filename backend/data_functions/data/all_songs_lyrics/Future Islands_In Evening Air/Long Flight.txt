Long Flight Lyrics
I got back from a long flight
You said you'd meet me there
I've been tripping off constellations and stars
I found you at home, what was our home
With another man, oh man
Been keeping you in my heart

And so I whispered into your ear
"What are you thinking about?"
You just looked up at the stars
And so I whispered into your ear
"Who are you thinking about?"
It couldn't be me

And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without the rivers to tend
Because you remember our love was true
But you just needed a hand
And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without yourself to defend
You know you hurt me so bad
Just ‘cause you needed a hand
And I went off and saw things I’ve never seen
I really wanted you there
But you ruined what was love
Just ‘cause you needed a hand
Just ‘cause you needed a hand

This is the way that it all falls
This is how I feel
This is what I need
You, by me--right here--by me
Right now

And so I whispered into your ear
"What are you thinking about?"
You just looked up at the stars
And so I whispered into your ear
"Who are thinking about?"
It couldn't be me

And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without the rivers to tend
Because you remember our love was true
But you just needed a hand
And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without yourself to defend
You know you hurt me so bad
Just 'cause you needed a hand
And I went off and saw things I've never seen
I really wanted you there
But you ruined what was love
Just cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand

And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without the rivers to tend
Because you remember our love was true
But you just needed a hand
And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without yourself to defend
You know you hurt me so bad
Just cause you needed a hand
And I went off and saw things I've never seen
I really wanted you there
But you ruined what was love
Just cause you needed a hand
Just cause you needed a hand
Just cause you needed a hand
Just cause you needed a hand
Just cause you needed a hand

Just ‘cause you needed a handEmbed
