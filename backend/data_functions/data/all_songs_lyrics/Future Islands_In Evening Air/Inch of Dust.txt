Inch of Dust Lyrics
A part of me - you have
A part of me - you hold
Apart from me - you stand
And there's parts that you have stole

You collect them in the cupboards
Like the pieces of a puzzle
And nest just like a mother
In the dampness of your sweater
And it's never put together
As I've watched you from the window
Behind the curtains, winter
Moves slowly as a tether
To wrap around you tightly
As lovers will in meadows
To fall in love with shadows
Where the snow is all but melted
And it's never put together
It's never put together
Behind the curtains, winter
Falls slowly as a feather

A part of you - I have
The part of you - I hide
A part of you I hold
The part you left behind
Call on me, I'll be there always
And call on me
I'll be there always
And call on me
I'll be there always
Call me
I'll be there always (Ooo-oo-oo-oooo)
Call me
I'll be there always (Ooo-oo-oo-oooo)
Call me
I'll be there always (Ooo-oo-oo-oooo)

A part of me - you have
A part of me - you hold
Apart from me - you stand
And there's parts that you have stole
A part of you - I have
The part of you--I hide
A part of you I stole
The part you left behindEmbed
