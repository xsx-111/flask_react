As I Fall Lyrics
I can't touch you anymore
I can't tell you how I feel, as I fall
You would walk
Heavy hearts do bury words
Under promises and "anything you wants," you'll have

Like a body without warmth
Feels the blood arrest
And blackens from the cold, I'd cave
For kings and queens misunderstand
Heaven isn't held - but takes you by the hand, so I've found
I can't touch you anymore
I can't tell you how I feel, as I fall
You would walk

Tame your thoughts and let me in
Break your callous ways and press me to your skin
Save a rose
I'd quell your thoughts and let you in
Break your savage ways and press you to my skin
Save a rose
I can't touch you anymore
I can't tell you how I feel, as I fall
You would walk
I can't touch you anymore
I can't tell you how I feel, as I fall
You would walk
You would walk
I can't touch you anymore
I can't tell you how I feel, as I fall
You would walk
I can't touch you anymore
I can't tell you how I feel, as I fall
You would walk
You would walk
You would walk
You would walk
You would walk
You would walk
You would walk
You would walk
You would walk
You would walkEmbed
