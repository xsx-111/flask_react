Walking Through That Door Lyrics
As processions fade
New hearts doubt
But you are Golden and no one questions it
But who you fake and how you sound
Asks the best of men
To share your sentiment

I want to be the one to help you find those years
That you've been talking about
Dreaming of the South
And all those lost goodbyes
And all those lonely tears
You never got to cry

It never works out right
Unless you're one to follow
Where the silence takes too long
When the night falls--when the night falls oh so slow
And caution isn't ours
When the night falls--when the night falls oh so low
We may lose control

I want to be the one to help you find those years
That you've been talking about
Dreaming of the South
And all those lonely nights
And all those lost goodbyes
You never got to sigh
I want to be the one to help you find those dreams
Because you've been hanging around
Talking about the South
And all those balmy nights
And all those lonely songs
You never got to write

And I'll hold your hand as I walk you through the door
And I'll hold your hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as you held my hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as you held my hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as you held my hand as I walk you through that door4Embed
