Swept Inside Lyrics
By the shattered calls of a mother's arms
All swept-inside like the rosary
That fell away when her girlish charms
Cried out to take on motherhood
She waits by the windowsill
All wrapped in white and puzzling
What happened to the child inside?
Who ran the streets and the days at night...

She says, "Nothing seems the same."
And, "I can't change a thing."
"My body's like a wave, breaking to the sea."
She says, "Everything seems strange."
Locked behind the years
But life is ours to find, in the days at night

There passes a stranger every eve
Who walks himself on a silver-leash
And in his head, the worlds asleep
Or, so the wrinkles in his hands believe
When he was young, he had a dream
To be a star, on the movie-screen
Now it all seems a silly lie
As he walks alone
And, the days on fire
He says, "Nothing seems the same."
And, "I can't feel a thing."
"My bodies like a wave, caving in on me"
He says, "Everything seems strange."
Holding back the tears
And he smiles just like a child
In the days at night

Mother of song
You'll find the right way
To cherish in dreams
All of the small things
Father in time
You'll find a world
That's so perfect and calm
All of the small things

Mother of song
You'll find the right way
To cherish in dreams
All of the small things
Father in time
You'll find a world
That's so perfect and calm
All of the small things

Mother of song
You'll find the right way
To cherish in dreams
All of the small things
Father in time
You'll find a world
That's so perfect and calm
All of the small things

Mother of song
You'll find the right way
To cherish in dreams
All of the small things
Father in time
You'll find a world
That's so perfect and calm
All of the small thingsEmbed
