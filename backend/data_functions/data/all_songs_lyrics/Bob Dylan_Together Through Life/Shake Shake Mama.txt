Shake Shake Mama Lyrics
I get the blues for you, baby, when I look up at the sun
I get the blues for you, baby, when I look up at the sun
Come back here, we can have some real fun

Well, it's early in the evening, and everything is still
Well, it's early in the evening, and everything is still
One more time, I'm walking up on heartbreak hill

Shake, shake, mama; like a ship going out to sea
Shake, shake, mama; like a ship going out to sea
You took all my money and you give it to Richard Lee

Down by the river, Judge Simpson walking around
Down by the river, Judge Simpson walking around
Nothing shocks me more than that old clown

Some of you women, you really know your stuff
Some of you women, you really know your stuff
But your clothes are all torn
And your language is a little too rough
Shake, shake, mama; shake it 'til the break of day
Shake, shake, mama; shake it 'til the break of day
I'm right here, baby, I'm not that far away

I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
It's Friday morning on Franklin Avenue

Shake, shake, mama; raise your voice and pray
Shake, shake, mama; raise your voice and pray
If you're goin on home, ya better go the shortest way3Embed
