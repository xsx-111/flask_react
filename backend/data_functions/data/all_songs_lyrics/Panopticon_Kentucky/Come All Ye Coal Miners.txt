Come All Ye Coal Miners LyricsCome all you coal miners
Wherever you may be
And listen to a story
That I'll relate to thee
My name is nothing extra
But the truth to you I'll tell
I'm a coal miner's son
I'm sure I wish you well
I was born in old Kentucky
In a coal camp born and bred
I know all about the pinto beans
Bulldog gravy and corn bread
And I know how the coal miners
Slave and work in the coal mines everyday
For a dollar in the company store
For that is all they pay
Coal mining is the most dangerous work
In our land today
With plenty of dirty, slaving work
And very little pay
Coal miner, won't you wake up
And open your eyes and see
What the dirty capitalist system
Is doing to you and me
They take your very life's blood
They take our children's lives
They take fathers away from children
And husbands away from wives
Oh miner, won't you organize
Wherever you may be
And make this land of freedom
For workers like you and me
Dear miner, they will slave you
Till you can't work no more
And what'll you get for your living
But a dollar in the company store?
A rundown shack to live in
Snow and rain pours in the top
You have to pay the company rent
Your payin' never stops
I am a coal miner's son
I'm sure I wish you well
Let's sink this capitalist system
In the darkest pits of hell

It's a commodity business. Every penny that they have to spend, for safety, for wages, for healthcare, or anything like that, it's money that they see coming directly out of their pocket. And the history of coal mining is very clear on this, it's not a subtle thing. This is an industry that views workers as disposable, and views the landscape as disposable. And it's all about getting the coal out of the ground as quickly and cheaply as possibleEmbed
