Killing the Giants as They Sleep LyricsWe wept as we passed through the mountains
Clothed in July clouds
Under the restraint of power lines
Their fury bursting through the summer haze
As ethereal music filled the air
Nearly conquered by the mountain
I have found such deep respect
For what you destroy
Older than time and cut down by a lesser foe
Like thieves in the night mined for coal
Timeless stone buried beneath
Unearthing the secret poisons into its belly…
You hack at the mountain
And scrape away for your simple need
What was formed by silent gods
On the day the void first burst with sound
Pulsing with life
You don't see its shimmering green
You see the deeps hue of coal
Grey smoke and black waters in the stream…
Poison the earth, poison the stream
Killing the weary giants as they sleep
Blackened waters, sand
And soot-grinding gears halt serenityEmbed
