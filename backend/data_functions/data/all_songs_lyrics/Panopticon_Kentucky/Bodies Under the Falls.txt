Bodies Under the Falls LyricsAs the water passes over the rock bed
So gentle and quiet
You can hear their cries in the crashing water
Bodies dashed against the rocks below
Where ghosts at the galls roam
The blood stained soil
Their ancestral forest…
Where only trees now know of the horrors seen here
Forgotten
A nation left to weep
Like spilling water over the falls
The water passes over stone
Falling so far below
Split blood and splintered bone
Where cherokee ghosts roam
Pale faces in the mist
Demons who claim the mountains
Treading beneath looming cliff
The cool, still air permeating your skin
The rhythm of the water
Pounding the forest floor
Whispers to us
With the voices of proud warriors
"Overcome"
The treaty was broken
The land has been stolen
The forest is haunted
Softly whispering in the dead air…
The blood stained stones in the deep…
Morosely contrasting against appalachian green…
Flows into the river, whisked away…
Vengeance was claimed on that day
Bullets for every pale face
The price owed could never be paid
Sorrow fills the air
Where tribal souls sleep
Beneath the cliffs where ywahoo falls forever weeps...Embed
