Black Math Lyrics
Don't you think that I'm bound to react now?
Well, my fingers definitely turning to black now
Yeah, well maybe I'll put my love on ice
Teach myself, maybe that'll be nice, yeah

My books are sitting at the top of the stack now
The longer words are really breaking my back now, yeah
Maybe I'll learn to understand
Drawing a square with a pencil in hand, yeah

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Mathematically turning the page
Unequivocally showing my age
I'm practically center stage
Undeniably earning your wage
Well maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice, yeah


Listen master, can you answer a question?
Is it the fingers, or the brain
That you're teaching a lesson?
I can't tell you how proud I am
I'm writing down things that I don't understand
Well, maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
