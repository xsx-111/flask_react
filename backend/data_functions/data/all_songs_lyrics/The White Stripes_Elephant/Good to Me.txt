Good to Me Lyrics
I've got a 1984 Volvo
I get in start it up and I go
It's not a vintage Cadillac
But it always gets me there and back

And it'll always be good to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me

I got a beat up Silver tone amp
I plug in and it sounds like a champ
It's not a Fender Tweed Deluxe
It only cost me a couple of bucks

And it'll always sound good to me
Always sound good to me
Always sound good to me
Always sound good to me

I got a girlfriend she's so true
And no other kind of girl will do
Cause I've known lots of girls in the past
And I knew none of their love would last
But this one will always be true to me
Always be true to me
Always be true to me
Always be true to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me
Good to me
Good to me
Good to me
