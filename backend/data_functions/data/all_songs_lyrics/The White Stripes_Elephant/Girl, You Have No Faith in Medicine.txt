Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine Lyrics
Girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen, you see the medicine
Oh girl

Is there a way to find the cure for this implanted in a pill?
It's just the name upon the bottle which determines if it will
Is the problem you're allergic to a well familiar name?
Do you have a problem with this one if the results are the same?
Acetaminophen, you see the medicine

Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen, you see the medicine
Oh girl


Girl, you have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen, you see the medicine
Oh girl
Well strip the bark right off a tree and just hand it this way
Don't even need a drink of water to make that headache go away
Give me a sugar pill and watch me just rattle down the street

Acetaminophen, you see the medicine
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl, oh girl3Embed
