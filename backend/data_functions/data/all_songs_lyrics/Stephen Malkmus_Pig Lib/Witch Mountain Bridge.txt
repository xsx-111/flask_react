Witch Mountain Bridge Lyrics
In better times
A spell could save you
And wine that we threw into a chasm
Came right back at you
Now it's all so straight and narrow
And the skeptics rule the nation
The servants scream
"Always wear black"

A stupid sin
Pneumatic witch-scapes
Give you a skewed impression
Of the realms of the magic arts
Yes, it's all over your head
So enjoy the dim vacation
A sermon reads
"Never wear black"


There is no "now"
You can tape that to your deviled brow
Time came before the end, my lord
Explain your cattle call
What we need is a soft second serve
Of your fine approximations
Shepherd read
"Always wear black"

You find the grace in true frustration
Time came before the end my lord, explainEmbed
