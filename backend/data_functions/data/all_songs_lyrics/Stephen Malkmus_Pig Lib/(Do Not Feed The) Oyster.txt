(Do Not Feed The) Oyster Lyrics
Crimson alligator blinded by the surf
Came here only yesterday from the worst place on this earth
But in this evil Everglades
You'll find no peace of mind
Watch out for the marsh hawk
He'll rip off your behind

Do not feed the oyster
Under a cloud
He'll suck you like a seagull into the so-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
Under a cloud
Do not feed the oysters
Under the grou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
Under the grou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
Underground


I hope you got there early
And I hope you brought your date
I hope she traveled to Chicago
Second class, not freight
Wedding bells and Christmas hell
To the life, you did aspire
No more time to fight about the tension in the choir
Do not feed the oysters
Under the clouds
They'll suck you like a seagull into the so-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
Under the cloud
Do not feed the oysters
Under the grou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
Under the grou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
Under the grou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
Under the grou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
Under the grou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
UndergroundEmbed
