Sheets Lyrics
To get to Transyldelphia a minor must go
Through oh so many foul hoops and I want you to know
I got a fingerful of catatonic drool
The way you cast the shape
Stutters me from head to toe

It takes all night to get off you
It takes all night to get off you
It takes all night to get off you, off you, off you

You are daffy just like you're a comedian
Who has been banished to the deep channels of my tv
'Cause you're not funny man
You're fuckin', fuckin' lame
Live a lie, live a lie, live a lie, live a lie, live a lie

It takes all night to get off you
It takes all night to get off you
It takes all night to get off you, off you, off you

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha woah

I interrogated you for hours on end
And though your story is tight I gotta hear it again
Your daddy's Portuguese
Well Jesus quelle surprise
Read about, read about, read about, read about, read about

It takes all night to get off you
It takes all night to get off you
It takes all night to get off you, off you, off you

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha1Embed
