Water and a Seat Lyrics
How far you go and what you say
Will never keep the tides away
The sea or the wind or the fog
Cut a window
Through a wall
Hello
Hello
Hello hello?
Hello? (Hello hello hello)

If madness comes, so much the better, touché
If madness comes, so much the better, touché

A wicked week and logic creed
I need water and a seat
The sea or the wind or the fog
A cup of snow, a snowflake kid
He is coming off the grid

Madness comes so much the better to sha--
If madness comes so much the better to sha--
Explosive path
I cannot dodge your draft
Because the air is like perfume from Vikings


Hanging with the brown rice clique
Tennyson and politics
 Right here, this where its all gonna its
Gonna happen right here, right?
*Random screaming and whooooa-ing*

Madness comes, so much the better to sha--
If madness comes, so much the better to sha--

Grass grows warped
Shade of the county court
I know you want that spawn just to your likingEmbed
