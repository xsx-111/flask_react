Animal Midnight Lyrics
Sacrifice for you is just flirtation
And friendship a cold convenience
I wonder sometimes what you're made of
Is it rayon or is it dust?
How you calibrate your intuition
Such that it just feeds the kill
And every single night I try to make you come alive
You shove it right back in my face

And you
You don't see me
Because you
You won't change
You
You don't see me
With your big old Russian brain
To keep you ahead of the stoplights

You to me is like carbon dioxide
You know I won't be your frozen rose
Why don't you just let me get up, yeah
Before you do the rowdy, rowdy, rowdy rough?
Reach, reach, cut it, cut it, reach, bleach, stud it, stud it
Seach, veech, nut it, nut it, bleach, beach, where will we fall?
Where will we fall? Where will we fall?
Before the darkness hits
Animal midnight
A shit for a brain
Crawl up a leech line
Shocking to me in the yellow and blue
Is it piss? Is it sky? Is it why we try?


And you
You don't see me
Because you
You won't change
You
You don't see me
Because you, you-you-you-you
You won't change
You won't changeEmbed
