Craw Song Lyrics
Martha wants Jackie
Jackie wants William
But William wants Leroy
But Leroy is straight
He couldn't commit to
The mental jujitsu
Of switchin' his hittin'
From ladies to men

Check it out, I rub so well
The marrows draw you out
I kiss and tell and make life hell
You know what it's about here
It's into the gold mirror

William was shattered
Not that it mattered
Message to Jackie
I'll see ya at eight
He cooked her a dinner
And boy it's a winner
It's better than chocolate
And pink champagne
They want
To stay
Confined within the fortress of this day
Stick that in your craw

Check me out I love so well
The marrow draws you out
We kiss and tell
And make life hell
You know what it's about
The memory's fine
A heart is like wine
A lover that is so sublime
Memory's fine
A heart is like red wine
A lover that is so sublime here

Two long shakes on the vine
The chills wonâ€™t shake on the fine
Everybody, every ohEmbed
