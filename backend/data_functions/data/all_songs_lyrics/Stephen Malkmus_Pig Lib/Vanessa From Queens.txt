Vanessa From Queens Lyrics
There’s aggression in the air this morning
Got your ballerina tights around my head
In a samurai pose on the bed
Vanessa from Queens
And the water dripping from the faucet
Is like Mardi Gras on the 12th of June
Why don’t you let me let me let me love you
Vanessa from Queens

I've got the right to fly
I'm gonna show you the time of your life
I got the rights to fly
So give it up right there now
Give it up right there now
What about


Well the avenue is in a panic
Bob Packwood wants to suck your toes
Such a lovely, lovely, lovely, way to go
Vanessa from Gresham, that’s right
Do your duty, work that body
Keep the elements off with a smile
And never have to work another day
Vanessa from Queens

I've got the right to fly
I'm gonna show you the time of your life
I got the right to fly
So give it up right there now (Give it up right there now)
Give it up right there now (Give it up right there now)Embed
