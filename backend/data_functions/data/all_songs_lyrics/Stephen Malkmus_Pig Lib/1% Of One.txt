1% Of One Lyrics
Blind soundman from Netherlands
He knew not what band he mixed
They sounded a bit like the Zephyr
And a bit like the Jicks
He craned his neck over the desk
Waiting for something to ride
And you weren't there to feed him air
The second that moment arrived

1% of one, 1%
1% of one, 1% of one is
1% of is one, 1%
1% of one, 1% of one is one

The band became a picture frame
Surrounding the vision he dreamt
Of walls a-walking 'round in squares
Dividing the room as they will
And there, my friend the story ends
Short though I know it may be
The band switched into a tune
And the halls were walking tall
1% of one, 1%
1% of one, 1% of one is
1% of is one, 1%
1% of one, 1% of one is
1% of one, 1%
1% of one is
1% of is one, 1%
1%


1% of one, 1%
1% of one, 1% of one is
1% of is one, 1%
1% of one, 1% of one is
1% of one, 1%
1% of one is
1% of is one, 1%
1% of one is
1% of one, 1% of one
1% of one, 1% of one
1% of one, 1% of one
1% of one, 1% of one
1% of one, 1% of one
1% of one, 1% of one
1% of one, 1% of one
1% of one, 1% of one
