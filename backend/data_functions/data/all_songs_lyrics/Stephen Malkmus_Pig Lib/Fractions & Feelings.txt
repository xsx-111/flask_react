Fractions & Feelings LyricsWhen I think of high school years
All the faces are not airbrushed
In fact they’re probably far more grotesque than real life as it was
Memories, they’re too surprising
Because memories they tend to distort and if you want a report I’ll hand it in yesterday
Take me to a higher place
Fractions and feelings
And the cops put a stop to all of our plots
The way that they walked and the way that they talked
Grow down you grow down…
Memories define the mind’s dj
So come along honey and let me say that’s what I’m on about
Yes we all evolve in haste
It’s a race you never finish
The grace does not diminish
The pace until the game is over
Of course you’re deeper than a team
But I hear the same chatter
You’re just the same matter
I’ve known with a few more years on your face
Take me to a higher place
With your fractions and your feelings
And the cops put a stop to all of our plots
The way that they talk and the way that they walk
They grow down they grow down…
Memories define the mind’s dj
So come along honey and let me say that’s what I’m on about
I hope I never see, I know I won’t ever goEmbed
