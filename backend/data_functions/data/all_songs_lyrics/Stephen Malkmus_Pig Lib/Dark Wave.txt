Dark Wave Lyrics
You fed his bod a metal rod
You turned into a fuselage
You took a ride on the new highway
And did a waltz on his jelly laze

Rising rising
 on your pictures is American icons rising rising
Run to the riches and your terrible shell ronde creatures
And Day-Glo kids with your riders on top too riding riding
If you're like me, it's not too late

You fantasize of decoupage
A two-horse carriage garage
Take the reins down the new highway
A culvert down to the ducks and drakes

Rising rising
Looking mighty fake on your bourgeois tailbone
Fly Zen, fly Zen
Assume all you will to this killing time
Blondie creature
Multiple gear with his eyes all around you
Ryan, Ryan
If you're like me, it's not too lateEmbed
