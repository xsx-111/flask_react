Old Jerry LyricsLet's hear it for the modern skirts
Hold it up until it hurts
Whistle through the trees and split the brown money
You'll never pop the solid earth
Smelling like a cowboy's cots
Wicked as a sailor's knot, she farts
Weather me parn and hit the ground running
You return to tease in vain
For Jerry, why don't you try Mary
Her feet are a wandering flame
For Jerry ride the canary
My feet are wandering again
The Cadillac of winter
Listen for the levels' click
Watch it or it just might stick
Whistle through my knees and hit a brown bunny
Hidin' in the neighbors' crick
Spell it out with rules and laws
This neighborhood is where the cats' applause
Weather me dawn hit the ground running
You're eaten to tease in vain
For Jerry
Don't you try Mary
Her feet are a wandering flame
For Jerry ride the canary
Her feet are a wandering flame
For Jerry ride the canary tonight x2
I don't like like what you like
Lost in the stickers on an ice cream truck
Your thoughts are what we took for granted
Heart is denser than a hockey puck
And rats in the pile on a tilted room
The walls are jagged and expanding
But you aren't there to feed them air
Poor Jerry
Don't you try Mary
Her feet are a wandering flame
For Jerry ride the canary tonight
I know you're not takin'...Embed
