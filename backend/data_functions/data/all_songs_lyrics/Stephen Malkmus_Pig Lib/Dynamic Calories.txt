Dynamic Calories Lyrics
Pack up the brats, it's 1983
You're in a band, "Dynamic Calories"
From York to New York you were a mild sensation
Covering costs, sleeping on floors and having flings
Baby, yeah
Laying it out, it was so atavistic

Make le rendezvous
Make le rendezvous
Make le rendezvous
Vous-hoo-oo

Times are gonna change
You will be amazed
Times are gonna change
You will be innate
Times are gonna change
They will come around again
As we take it in

Vocal panache, specializing in drama
Jangly guitars, angular chops, and those wet, wet drums
But unlike that metal that lives on and on
You are forgotten like a drab dress
Rendezvous
Le rendezvous
Make le rendezvous
Vous-vous

Times are gonna change
You will be amazed
Times are gonna change
You will be amazed
Times are gonna change
But they will come around again
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Times are gonna change
You will be amazed
Times are gonna change
You will be innate
Times are gonna change
You will be innate
Times are gonna change
You will be amazedEmbed
