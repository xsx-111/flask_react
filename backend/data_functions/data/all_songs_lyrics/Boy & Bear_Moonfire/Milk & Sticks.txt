Milk & Sticks Lyrics
Born from a soldier's arms
But our spirit keeps a-moving on
And one metre at a time we'll fall
It's a bloody hill in a broken war
We've been singing like a lunatic
And knee deep in our milk and sticks
Just a kid with a broken arm
It's a slingshot, a hail of harm

Ooh, I'm hungry for the feeling, honey
'Cause it's moving faster than the speed of sound
I left you a lizard by the lake, my lover
It was so profound

While we found
While we found

Torn like a beaten man
It's another dog in a foreign land
And keep on carrying a broken stone
And new tricks and a buried bone
We were born to be motivated
Cut off and a-cultivated
I promise you when the time does come
We'll be down river with a loaded gun
Ooh, I'm hungry for the feeling, honey
'Cause it's moving faster than the speed of sound
I left you a lizard by the lake, my lover
It was so profound

While we found
While we found
While we found
While we found

Just like the rest
You'll be coming back, you'll be looking for paradise
For the silver line
That separates your body from your mind
What a mess we're in
There's a monster in my head
There's an animal screaming down upon my neck
Oh no, you better get up, my friend
There's a monster in my head
There's an animal screaming down upon my neck
Oh no, you better get up, my friend

What a mess we're in
Oh no, you better get up, my friend
Oh no, you better get up, my friend
Yeah
Oh, you know you better run, my friendEmbed
