Big Man Lyrics
Well, I bit on my lip and I kicked at my toes
No, I don't need your lecture, 'cause your lecture won't show
That you told me, so I told you so
But I would have managed, I would have been fine
I can do it myself and I'll do it just my way
I'm a big man for thinking just so

But somebody told me that your mother was born
W-w-wandering woman, with a spirit so sworn of the riverside
And it never surprised me
But it meant that my love was immobilised
Whoa, it meant that my love was immobilised
'Cause when it comes, it comes when it does

But you came in the middle and you fell in my hands
Oh, a wonderful woman and an average man
See, that makes me the lucky man
I won't be deserving, but I won't be denied
See, I fell in this position, I will still teach my kids pride
Because failure's a part of it all
And if failure don't hurt, then failure don't work no more

But somebody told me that your nephew was born
Oh, a beautiful baby, so smart and so sure of his little self
And in a wonderful way, he was making me feel so small
Was making me feel so small
Was making me feel so small
And I don't think I've felt this before
In all the reasons to come
Well, they override my body and I point to the sun
'Cause where it's warm is where the wilderness grows
And it grows, and it grows
'Til it all becomes nothing and nothing is left, as you know

We walked it for a thousand years
With broken eyes and salted ears
Complaining 'bout the weather like we ever had a choice
Through all the noise and self-abuse
You waited for your fill of truth
Oh, I'm terrified I'll achieve nothing at allEmbed
