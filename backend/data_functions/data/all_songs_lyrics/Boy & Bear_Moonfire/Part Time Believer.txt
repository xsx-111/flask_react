Part Time Believer Lyrics
We've run out of reason
Losing sight of what it's supposed to be
A part time believer 'til truth
We've somehow conceded
This sense of self-evasive solitude
It means way too much to me

And I hope you know
How lucky you are

Oh, I remember sitting back on my balcony
I was a-listening to the Rolling Stones
See, I was waiting for my dad to come home from work
So I could show him all the chords that I'd learnt
See, I was under the impression I was gonna lead
Some kind of simple, understated life
But now I'm living in the shadows of a memory
And I hope so, man, I hope so

It's been way too long
It seems that I can't celebrate my meaning
For I am too young to mourn
And if it won't release
It pulls and it pushes me 'til I wither
'Til I wither, 'til I wither
And I hope you know
How lucky you are

Oh, I remember sitting back on my balcony
I was a-listening to the Rolling Stones
See, I was waiting for my dad to come home from work
So I could show him all the chords that I'd learnt
See, I was under the impression I was gonna lead
Some kind of simple, understated life
But now I'm living in the shadows of a memory
And I hope so, man, I hope so

And, oh, you dare, you run like a lion
To defend your senses
And, oh, it seems it cuts at the core
It's not the same, my friend, no more
Oh no

See, I was waiting for my dad to come home from workEmbed
