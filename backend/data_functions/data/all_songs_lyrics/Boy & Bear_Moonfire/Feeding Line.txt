Feeding Line Lyrics
My body moves in time
We're begging on the feeding line
We're lifting out above this head space
See, my body overflows

But I got my whole damn life
Caught up in moments entirely of yours

But I'm finding it harder to reason in order to grow
And finding it hard is a feeling that all of you know
Know, know

See, my body keeps in line
And I got my whole damn life
Oh, and I want to be somebody, somebody, someone
You're so desperate now
Oh no, you won't let it go
But you bit off your tongue to become one

And nevertheless, when this pain in my chest seems to grow
I'm living it harder to feel what it feels like to know
You know, know, know
In the home I lived in, I came to grow
My body cumbersome and slow
But I felt it, felt it coming over me
In the home I lived in, I came to grow
My body cumbersome and slow
But I felt it, felt it coming over me

And I got my whole damn life
Caught up in moments entirely of yours

But I'm finding it harder to reason in order to grow
And finding it hard is a feeling that all of you know
And nevertheless, when this pain in my chest seems to grow
And grow
You know, know, knowEmbed
