House & Farm Lyrics
I built my home in a day
Come and see, if you may
There's a rabbit in the garden that's keeping it all in place
I held the truth in my arms
It's a house and a farm
And a wife and my children to wait on with open arms
Arms, no

You're too old to be chasing your gold
Run with me to the sea
And we'll wait together
Patiently, oh, dear
It's too late
To be carrying on this way
When you're so close to God

You're so damn far away
And oh, it's too much
When the winter falls too cold to touch
Won't you hide in my armory, harmony?
Come to me, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
'Cause all that wanted, all that I needed
All that I wanted was to be
And all that I wanted, all that I needed
All that I wanted was to be alone
Was to be alone
Was to be aloneEmbed
