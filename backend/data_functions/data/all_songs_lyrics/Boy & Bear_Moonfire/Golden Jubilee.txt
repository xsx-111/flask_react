Golden Jubilee Lyrics
Come dancing in my garden on my haven, won't you, dear?
We've ripped down all the doors on what was no ordinary open field

See, I sit alone
In my home

We were old enough to see
That the gods were spinning roses down from Golden Jubilee
I do believe that something's happening to me
Must be something in the water, it's coming for you
Necessary in the water, it's coming for you
Yeah, woo
Yeah

It's my home

We were old enough to see
That the gods were spinning roses down from Golden Jubilee
I do believe that something's happening to me
Must be something in the water, it's coming for you
Necessary in the water, it's coming for you
Yeah, woo
Yeah
Won't somebody hold me close?
For the time it takes is inevitably rolling in it
Drifting in my boat
So, the man on the water said
"One day, this all will end and you'll be dead"
So I'll undertake my time
With the deception on my mind
I'll be fine

We were old enough to see
That the gods were spinning roses down from Golden Jubilee
I do believe that something's happening to me
Must be something in the water, it's coming for you
Necessary in the water, it's coming for you
No, no
No, no
No, oh, oh, oh
Oh, no, no
No, no
Oh, no, no, oh, no, oh, oh-oh-oh

Necessary in the water, it's coming for you
Necessary in the water, it's coming for you
Necessary in the water, it's coming for you
For you, for you, for you, for youEmbed
