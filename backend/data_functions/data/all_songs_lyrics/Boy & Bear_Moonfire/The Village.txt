The Village Lyrics
Where did I go?
How did I come to reach this place?
If only I'd learned to let them hold me
There's a beggar with gold
Said he made a village built with clay
Before it all got washed away

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Down by the river, where the river is so cold
And the older women come to play
Steady my heart 'cause the pattern of your soul
Is spoken in the rhythm of yesterday

Na-na-na, yeah, yeah
Na-na-na, yeah, yeah
Na-na-na, yeah, yeah
Na-na-na, yeah, yeah
Where did I go?
How did I come to reach this place?
If only I'd let the beggars show me
To the valley of gold
Where once stood a village build with clay
Before it all got washed awayEmbed
