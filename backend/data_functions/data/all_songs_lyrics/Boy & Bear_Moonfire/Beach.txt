Beach Lyrics
Take my eyes, my melody
For I choose not to see
Mix my blood with honey
For the taste, so sweet
I felt it moving through my skin
This feeling wrapped around my sin

I'm shedding off my innocence, mm
It plays upon my sanity
This feel, it's taking over me

One with my head, my soul, my memory
My loving home, my family

As I'm shedding off my innocence
For the lizard I choose to be
To be young, my friend, is a curse nonetheless
And a curse I choose to leave
I felt it moving through my skin
This feeling wrapped around my sin

One with my head, my soul, my memory
My loving home, my family
I know they'll come for me
If I need, if I need
For I see the love in you
It feeds me, it feeds me
And you, you fell upon my plate
And you make the same mistakes

My head, my soul, my memory
My loving home, my family
They'll come, they'll come for me
If I need, if I need
For I see the love in you
It feeds me, it feeds meEmbed
