Lordy May Lyrics
Oh my god, we are done
So come take my daughter and come take my son
See, we never followed
No, we never followed

Whoa, and I've been in through your garden
And I've been to your grave
But Lordy May
When I come to my end someday
Will I find myself sitting at some golden gate?
Or will it all just float away?
Yeah, my end someday

I wonder if my heart will be hungry
I wonder when my body does decay
I somehow imagined I'd walk this Earth
No, forever, forever

Whoa, and I've been in through your garden
And I've been to your grave
But Lordy May
When I come to my dying days
Won't you promise me this, that I go in grace?
And I'd be happy to just float away
