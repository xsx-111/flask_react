My Only One Lyrics
It found me deep beneath the water
This time it looked and felt so different
I'm begging to my loved ones, understand
I'm a useless man, the loving hand
That you fell for
That you fell for

I took my fear back to Galileo
They told me, "Son, just count your blessings"
I wandered through those streets that you wouldn't mend
And I felt so low, the man I used to know
That you fell for
That you fell for

And oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, I wander
And oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, I live in fear
'Cause when my shadow moves, I shudder
For the fear inside my heart won't disappear
No, dear

'Cause I sold my spirit for your soul
I felt it running through my fingertips
I love you more than you will know
And I hope you understand
My strength lies in your hands
And oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, I wander
And oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, I live in fear
'Cause when my shadow moves, I shudder
For the fear inside my heart won't disappear
No, dear

You took my only one
When I only wanted love
When I only wanted love
You took my only one
When I only wanted love
When I only wanted love
You took my only one
When I only wanted love
When I only wanted love
You took my only one
When I only wanted love
When I only wanted love
You took my only one
When I only wanted love
When I only wanted loveEmbed
