Already Gone LyricsIf there were an ocean
We’d be wading in the distance
There would be only water
Creating a resistance
A place to decompress
A vat of chlorine’s close enough, I guess
If there were an ocean
We’d glisten on the surface
Surface
Instead of an eruption
We bubble, only briefly
When there is erosion
We both regret it, deeply
I arrived at the scene, you were perfectly surrounded by pylons
When the crowd separated, the officer said you were already gone
Appetite minuscule
Middle of the night
Drain the pool
The summer’s over
I don’t think I could find it
I don’t know how to find it again
Don’t think that I could get behind it
I don’t think I will ever find it again1Embed
