Plimsoll Punks Lyrics
When I chip through your candy coating
You're stuffed with insulation
Just strawberry ice cream floating
With a sprinkle of indignation
Cherry under knot of shoestring
Conflate and agitate

You're a plimsoll punk
You're a plimsoll punk

And you're gettin' me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down
Gettin' me down down down, you're gettin' me down
Gettin' me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down
Plimsoll punk

Your posture's blocking out any possible light
I can hardly see
This conversation spirals into a fight
I can barely breathe

Who ran from Roman candles
Underneath a willow weeping?
Do the tealights on your mantel
Illuminate that summer feeling?
You're the seashell in my sandal
That's slicing up my heel
You're a plimsoll punk
You're a plimsoll punk

And you're getting me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down
Gettin' me down down, down you're gettin' me down
R-r-r-racking my brain, trying to escape, getting me down
Plimsoll punk
Plimsoll punk

Your posture's blocking out any possible light
I can no longer see
This conversation spirals into a fight
I can barely breathe

Gettin' me down, gettin' me down, you're gettin' me down
Gettin' me down down down, you're gettin' me down
Gettin' me down, gettin' me down, you're gettin' me down
Plimsoll punk
Plimsoll punk
