Hey LyricsHey
Have you lost your sense of place?
Hold a brush to your white toothpaste
Does the mirror look a little strange?
You:
Satisfied with making do
(Don’t think so, yeah)
Should we pull the parachute?
(Don't think so)
I will land on my feet but I probably won’t leave the house for awhile and it feels like forever since you held me like I was a human being
And I am a human being
Blind in an alleyway
Assuring you I’m fine
Blind in an alleyway
Positive I’m fine
Molly Mayhem
On your doorstep
At three AM
Fight and you run and you run
And it’s likely over now
Fight and you run and you run
And you want it over now
Over now
Over now
This is the nineteenth round
And you know it
This is not the right crowd
And you know itEmbed
