Your Type Lyrics
Hop that fence if you wanna
Then dissolve into the night
Ditch your friends on a whim
Later, resurface in a fight
Kill the buzz with your decrees and conspiracy theories

I die on the inside every time
You will never be alright
I will never be your type

Gambling with your working visa
You’ve got something to prove
Take a photo of the Mona Lisa
Get thrown out of the Louvre
And with vomit on your feet
Clamouring bon appetit

I die on the inside every time
You will never be alright
I will never be your type
I will never be your type
Knew that I would never be your type
Knew that I would never be your type

Hop that fence if you'd like to
Then dissolve into the night
All depends how it strikes you
Without reason, without rhyme
Let me state delicately, you’re an O and I’m AB

I die on the inside every time
You will never be alright
I will never be your type
I will never be your type
I will never be your typeEmbed
