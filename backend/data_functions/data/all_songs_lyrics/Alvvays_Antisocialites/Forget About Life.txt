Forget About Life Lyrics
I thought of going in the lake and swallowing
Thought that I had unplugged the phone until it rang
When the phases of the moon, they donâ€™t apply
When accomplishing a simple task takes several tries

Did you want to forget about life?
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight?
Underneath this flickering light
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight?

Left the apartment in a state of disarray
Tried out the synthesizer you bought yesterday
When the failures of the past, they multiply
And you trivialize the things that keep your hand from mine

Did you want to forget about life?
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight?
Under condominium signs
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight?
Woo!
Do you want to forget about life?
Do you want to forget about life with me tonight?
Underneath this flickering light
Do you want to forget about life with me tonight?
Inhaling this undrinkable wine
(Forget everything tonight)
Forget about life with me tonight?
(Forget everything tonight)
Under the condominium signs
Did you want to-whoa-oh-oh
(Forget everything tonight)5Embed
