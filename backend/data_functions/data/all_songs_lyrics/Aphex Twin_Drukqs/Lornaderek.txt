Lornaderek Lyrics
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Richard
Happy birthday to you

Hahaha, hahaha
Happy birthday, my little son
My little 28-year-old son
Well, you were born by now
Because you were born about five o'clock in the morning
Uh, bundle up
You have a lovely day, I hope your card cameEmbed
