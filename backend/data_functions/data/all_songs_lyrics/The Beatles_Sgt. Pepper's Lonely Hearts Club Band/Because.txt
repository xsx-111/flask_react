Because Lyrics
Ahh

Because the world is round, it turns me on
Because the world is round
Ahh

Because the wind is high, it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
Ahh

Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
