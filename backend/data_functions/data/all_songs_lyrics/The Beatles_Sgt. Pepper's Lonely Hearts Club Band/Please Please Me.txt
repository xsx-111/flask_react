Please Please Me Lyrics
Last night, I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl

Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you

You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say, love?

Come on (Come on), Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on), Come on (Come on)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you

I don't want to sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart (In my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you it's so hard to reason
With you, whoa yeah, why do you make me blue?

Last night, I said these words to my girl
I know I never even try girl
Come on (Come on) Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on) Come on (Come on)
Please, please me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Me, whoa yeah, like I please you8Embed
