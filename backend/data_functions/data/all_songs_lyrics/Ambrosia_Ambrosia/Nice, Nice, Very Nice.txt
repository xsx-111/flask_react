Nice, Nice, Very Nice Lyrics(Vonnegut Jr. - Puerta - Pack - North - Drummond)
Oh a sleeping drunkard
Up in Central Park
Or the lion hunter in the jungle dark
Or the Chinese dentist
Or the British Queen
They all fit together in the same machine
Nice, nice, very nice
Nice, nice, very nice
So many people in the same device
Oh a whirling dervish
And a dancing bear
Or a Ginger Rogers and a Fred Astaire
Or a teenage rocker
Or the girls in France
Yes, we all are partners in this cosmic dance
Nice, nice, very nice
Nice, nice, very nice
So many people in the same device
I wanted all things to make sense
So we'd be happy instead of tense
Oh a sleeping drunkard
Up in Central Park
Or the lion hunter in the jungle dark
Or the Chinese dentist
Or the British Queen
They all fit together in the same machine
Nice, nice, very nice
Nice, nice, very nice
So many people in the same device
So many people in the same deviceEmbed
