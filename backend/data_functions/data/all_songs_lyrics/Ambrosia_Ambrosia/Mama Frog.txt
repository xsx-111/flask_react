Mama Frog Lyrics(Puerta - North - Drummond - Pack)
The clock gets to be such a bore
What'cha livin' for
Though I can't explain, being sane's
Just a dreary chore
I'd like to go fly past mountains
See Mama Frog at her fountain
She'll be there in her golden frog
Sequined uniform
Golden chair, three trained human clowns
Who will soon perform
Balancing books with their heads
Trying to recall what they've said
Past the gate you will soon be in
A garden paradise
Don't be late there, the shining jewels
Sparkle in your eyes
All waiting there for your pleasure
What's keeping you from this treasure?
Narration of "Jabberwock" from "Alice In Wonderland"
'Twas brillig and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch ?Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumlous Bandersnatch!"
He took his vorpal sword in hand: Long time the manxome foe he sought ?So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought
And as in uffish thought he stood, The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came!
One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back
"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!" He chortled in his joy
'Twas brillig and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble In the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves And the mome raths outgrabe
The clock gets to be such a bore
What'cha livin' for
Though I can't explain, being sane's
Just a dreary chore
I'd like to go fly past mountains
See Mama Frog at her fountainEmbed
