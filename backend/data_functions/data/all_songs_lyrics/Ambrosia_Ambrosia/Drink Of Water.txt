Drink Of Water Lyrics(Puerta - Pack - North - Drummond)
Someone talks about a road
At the end find life's gold
I went out to get a drink of water
But I saw an ocean far away
I thought of how much beyond awaits me
Foolishly I turned my head the other way
Do you like where you're livin' at?
I'm not happy inside
You could build a golden house
Yeah but still I'm sad inside
I set out on a long and lonely journey
And travelled through some strange and distant lands
And many times I thought I'd found life's meaning
But it slipped away like water in the sand
Do you like where you're livin' at?
I'm not happy inside
You could build a golden house
And still I'm sad inside
One summer storm, I'm waitin' for the sun
One summer storm, I've waited so long
Waited so long Yeahhhhhhhh!
In our lives, we've all drank of the water
Heard the ocean callin' out our names
Some will seek and find their life's meaning
And some will turn their heads the other way...Embed
