Make Us All Aware Lyrics(Pack - Drummond - Puerta - North)
Pale to the mountains my existence seems
Sad as the cry of my unanswered dreams
Long have I waited for time to make clear
All of the reasons that I must be here
But I won't care If you are there
Make us all aware
Drawn by the river we watch as it flows
Wanting to taste of the wisdom it holds
Knowing that somewhere our fortunes we'll find
But fortunes are something we hold in our minds
We could share All that's there
Make us all aware
Seeking an answer yet harboring fear
That the day that it comes I'll no longer be here
But I won't care If you are there I won't care Make us all Oh, I won't care Make us all awareEmbed
