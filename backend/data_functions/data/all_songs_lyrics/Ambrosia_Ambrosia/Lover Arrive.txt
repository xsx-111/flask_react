Lover Arrive Lyrics(Pack)
Lover arrive Lover arrive
Take me on wings into your heart
Find a new start
Lover arrive Lover arrive
Take me from here into your soul
We can be whole
Remember the days
We'd run away
Laughing among all the fields
You looked at me
And all I could see
Were your eyes a shinin' so real
Ohhhh, li, li, li, li
Ahh ah, li, li, li, li
Lover arrive Lover arrive
Take me from here into your heart
Then we can startEmbed
