Discharge Lyrics
I'll wait, I hate
Silence kills you like a loaded gun
My time you waste
Resolution, turn your back and run

Drunk with power, your ivory tower
Never stood, never could
And around and around
You hit the ground
Reservation Hellbound

Most people cry when a person dies, you wanna know why?
Run it through, discharge
Most people cry not when you died, you wanna know why?
Run it through, discharge
Nobody cried, you lived a lie, you lived a lie
Run it through, discharge
Most people cry when a person dies, you wanna know why?
Run it through, discharge

Your life, what life?
What's the difference between you and death?
Overdose, comatose
You won't even leave a corpse that's fresh
Drunk with power, go take a shower
I wish you would, I wish you could
And around and around
You hit the ground
Reservation Hellbound

A surreal vision
Of a human being

Most people cry when a person dies, you wanna know why?
Run it through, discharge
Most people cry not when you died, you wanna know why?
Run it through, discharge
Nobody cried, you lived a lie, you lived a lie
Run it through, discharge
Most people cry when a person dies, you wanna know why?
Run it through, discharge

Self-inflicted crucifixion
Suicidal contradiction
Cluster fucked, you load it up
Cluster fucked, you self-destruct

Get off my dick, it's sick
I refuse to feel sorry for you
I can't believe
People put you on a pedestal

Drunk with power, your ivory tower
Never stood, never could
And around and around
You hit the ground
Reservation Hellbound

A surreal vision
Of a human being

Most people cry when a person dies, you wanna know why?
Run it through, discharge
Most people cry not when you died, you wanna know why?
Run it through, discharge
Nobody cried, you lived a lie, you lived a lie
Run it through, discharge
Most people cry when a person dies, you wanna know why?
Run it through, dischargeEmbed
