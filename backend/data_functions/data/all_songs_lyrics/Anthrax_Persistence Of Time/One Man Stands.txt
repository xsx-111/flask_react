One Man Stands Lyrics

The enemy is dead
I can't believe what I said
The enemy is dead
Did it only exist in our head?
Sheltered from the evils of the world until the truth is seen
Sheltered from realities of life, your human rights are free
Freedom, taken for granted
'Cause we don't know what oppression means
Freedom, taken for granted
By the leaders who would crush the dream

A crack exposing human rights
Light against a granite sky
A crack exposing human life
A fire burns
For the freedom, for the freedom
For the freedom never given but taken
For the freedom, die for the reason

One man stands
Hard as he waits for freedom's hand
A unified voice for the freedom of choice
One man stands for life
He'll give his
Would you give yours to fight for a cause?
One man stands
And the wall cracks, and the wall cracks
And the wall cracks, and the walls come crumbling

Down with old ideals that could never work in modern times
Free choice, religious freedom
Basic rights are on the bottom line
Down with all the icons of the past cold war and detente
The flock no longer fears the wolf
The flock is taking what it wants

A crack exposing human rights
Light against a granite sky
A crack exposing human life
A fire burns
For the freedom, for the freedom
For the freedom never given but taken
For the freedom, die for the reason

One man stands
Hard as he waits for freedom's hand
A unified voice for the freedom of choice
One man stands for life
He'll give his
Would you give yours to fight for a cause?
One man stands
And the wall cracks, and the wall cracks
And the wall cracks, and the walls come crumbling down


One man stands for life, I never questioned
One life costs us all, they love their children
Every man stands and fights, who's my enemy?
One man's rule will fall, one man stands

One man stands
Hard as he waits for freedom's hand
A unified voice for the freedom of choice
One man stands for life
He'll give his
Would you give yours to fight for a cause?
One man stands

And the wall cracks, and the wall cracks
And the wall cracks, and the walls come crumbling downEmbed
