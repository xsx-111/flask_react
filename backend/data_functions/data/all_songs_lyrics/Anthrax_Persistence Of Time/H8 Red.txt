H8 Red Lyrics
So I say to you, so you look at me
What do I have to do?
And you look at me
So I say to you, you just look at me
What the Hell do you see?

Do I hate you?
No, I don't think so
Words don't describe
What my feelings know
Do I hate you?
No, and I refuse to go
Down to your level
Just to feed my ego
Do I hate you?
Yes, I got it off my chest
I hate you for making me regress
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Looking at me
What do you see?
I don't see in black and white
I see things in wrong and right
Do I hate you?
Think, it takes a man to think
And to admit his ignorance
You can't just look at my face
You can't judge me by my race
We gotta stop, stop, stop, stop
What do you see?
So I say to you
Just look at me
I say to you
Different and
All this hatred, all this hatred
And do I hate you?
I can't take it, all this hatred

You may not know this
We may be different
Different but equal
Different and free
You may not know this
We may be different
Different but equal
Different and free

All this hatred, all this hatred
And do I hate you?
I can't take it, stop this hatred
Now

Do I hate you?
Do I hate you?
Do I hate you?
Yes
Do I hate you and placate you?
Do I hate you?
Do I hate you?
No

No, I'm not that arrogant
To not admit my ignorance
And do you think I really care
When you sit there and you stare?
I can't help but feel sorry for you
And maybe even pity too
My answer's no, and this is true
Do I hate you?

All this hatred, all this hatred
I can't take it, all this hatred

You may not know this
We may be different
Different but equal
Different and freeEmbed
