The Number One Song in Heaven Lyrics
This is the number one song in heaven
Written, of course, by the mightiest hand
All of the angels are sheep in the fold of their master
They always follow the Master and his plan
This is the number one song in heaven
Why are you hearing it now, you ask
Maybe you're closer to here than you imagine
Maybe you're closer to here than you care to be

It's number one, all over heaven
It's number one, all over heaven
It's number one, all over heaven
The number one song all over heaven
If you should die before you wake
If you should die while crossing the street
The song that you'll hear, I guarantee
It's number one, all over heaven
It's number one, all over heaven
It's number one, all over heaven
The number one song all over heaven
The one that's the rage up here in the clouds
Loud as a crowd or soft as a doubt
Lyrically weak, but the music's the thing
Gabriel plays it, God how he plays it
Gabriel plays it, God how he plays it
Gabriel plays it, God how he plays it
Gabriel plays it, let's hear him play it
It's number one, all over heaven
It's number one, all over heaven
It's number one, all over heaven
The number one song all over heaven
The song filters down, down through the clouds
It reaches the earth and winds all around
And then it breaks up in millions of ways
It goes la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
In cars it becomes a hit
In your homes it becomes advertisements
And in the streets it becomes the children singing
Oooh, la la la la la la la
Oooh, la la la la la la la
Oooh, la la la la la la laEmbed
