Listen to my other voice
Listen to my other voice
My voice
You're so independent but that's gonna change real soon
With my other voice I can destroy this room
I'll wrap my voice around you and I'll drag you everywhere
My other voice
You think you're romantic, well I'll whisper in your ear
I'll be all you'll hear for years and years and years
You may be deaf to everything, you won't be deaf to me
