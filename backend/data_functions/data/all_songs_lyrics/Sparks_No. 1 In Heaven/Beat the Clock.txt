Beat the Clock Lyrics(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock
You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock
You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock
You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
I was born a little premature (You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
Mom just couldn't take no more (You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
Had no time to learn to cry
Goodbye, Mama, got to fly
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye  (You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock
You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
Entered school when I was two  (You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
PhD'd that afternoon  (You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
Never entered any sports
Didn't look too good in shorts
Got divorced when I was four  (You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock
You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
I've seen everything there is
I've done everything there is
I've met everyone but Liz
Now I've even met ol' Liz
No time for relationship
Skip the foreplay, let 'er rip
You gotta beat the clock, beat the clock
Beat the clock, beat the clock
I did lots of travelling
Parts of me unravelling
The Army then rejected me
Said I had two flat feet
Wore them out when I was three
Too bad there ain't ten of you
Then I'd show you what I'd do
I could cheat on five of you
And be faithful to you too
But there's only one of you
I've seen everything there is
I've done everything there is
I've met everyone but Liz
Now I've even met ol' Liz
No time for relationship
Skip the foreplay, let 'er rip
You gotta beat the clock, beat the clock
Beat the clock, beat the clockEmbed
