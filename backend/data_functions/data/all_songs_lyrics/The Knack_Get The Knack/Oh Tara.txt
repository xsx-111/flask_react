Oh Tara LyricsOh Tara (Doug Fieger)
Oh Tara oh oh
You squeeze my heart
And then you let it go
Ooh Tara my oh my
I can't help falling
No I wouldn't try
I can't explain no I don't know how
And all my talking means nothing now
It only frightens you anyhow
You'll never know what you've done to me
The agony and the ecstasy
Ooh Tara it's alright
But I miss you tonight
I don't expect you to understand
The thrill I feel when I hold your hand
But this is something I never planned
You're thinking of me as just a friend
My heart is breaking I can't pretend
Ooh Tara it's for real
I can't help how I feel1Embed
