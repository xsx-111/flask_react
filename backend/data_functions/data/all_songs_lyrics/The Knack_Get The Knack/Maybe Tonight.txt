Maybe Tonight LyricsI don't know why I never said it before
I don't know why I waited so long to be sure
But I... everything's coming
Something's coming, maybe tonight
Funny to think I had to clown and pretend
Never knew I saw you as more than a friend
But I... come hold me tighter, come make it right
Maybe tonight, oh maybe tonight
Ever since the day I saw you
I was blown away 'cause I knew I could not say
All the things I had to say
I was such a shy guy, I could not tell you I love you
Well maybe tonight, yes maybe tonight
Come make it right, maybe tonight
Yes maybe tonight
Ever since the day I saw you
I was blown away 'cause I knew I had to say
All the things I had to say
I was such a shy guy
I could not tell you I love you
Well maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Yes maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonightEmbed
