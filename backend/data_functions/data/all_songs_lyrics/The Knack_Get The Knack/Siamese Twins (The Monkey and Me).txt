Siamese Twins (The Monkey and Me) LyricsHe's on my back. He's on my back. He's on my back
He's on my back. He's on my back. He's on my back
Please cut me free
He's making me strange
The monkey and me
Sits on my back. Shits on my back. Piss on my back
Sits on my back. Shits on my back. Piss on my back
Kill it for me
It's time for a change
The monkey and me
Starlight, starbright, first star tonight
Wish my brother was no longer
Cut deep, do it right away
Cut clean, make a getaway
Leave it out on the highway
Kill it for me
It's time for a change
The monkey and me
Starlight, starbright, first star tonight
Wish my brother was no longer
Cut deep, do it right away
Cut clean, make a getaway
Leave it out on the highway
He's on my back. He's on my back. He's on my back
He's on my back. He's on my back. He's on my back
Please cut me free
He's making me strange
The monkey and me
The monkey and me
The monkey and me
The monkey and meEmbed
