Maybe Tonight (Rehearsal recording) LyricsI dont know why i never said it before
I dont know why i waited so long to be sure
But i... everythings coming
Somethings coming, maybe tonight
Funny to think i had to clown and pretend
Never knew i saw you as more than a friend
But i... come hold me tighter, come make it right
Maybe tonight, oh maybe tonight
Ever since the day i saw you
I was blown away 'cause i knew i could not say
All the things i had to say
I was such a shy guy, i could not tell you i love you
Well maybe tonight, yes maybe tonight
Come make it right, maybe tonight
Yes maybe tonight
Ever sense the day i saw you
I was blown away 'cause i knew i had to say
All the things i had to say
I was such a shy guy
I could not tell you i love you
Well maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Yes maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonightEmbed
