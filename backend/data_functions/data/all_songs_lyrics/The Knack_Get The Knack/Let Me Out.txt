Let Me Out LyricsOne, two, three, four!
Let me out, come and get me out
'cause I've been stuck in for too long
Let me out, out, come get me out
Baby, maybe be where I belong
The time is right for stepping out in the light
My cup is full, and I'll be pulling the wool tonight
Tonight
Let me out, come and get me out
You know that she don't understand
Let me out, out, come get me out
Baby, I'm just living for the band
It's getting tighter, and I'm feeling the bite
But I don't care, because I'm getting my share tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight (whoo)
Let me out, come get me out
I'm just a prisoner of your love
Let me out, out, come and get me out
Baby, I will never have enough
I guess I'm getting while the getting is right
She may be faking, but I'm taking my chance tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, out, let me out
Let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out!Embed
