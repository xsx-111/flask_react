Common Heat LyricsI try to make myself seem vague
'Cause the words get so engraved
I don't like nothin' I heard before now
Why do I come so close expecting to control?
Everyone around me knows
I'm in trouble
I get myself up to go to work
I can't find my cleanest shirt
There's no way I can get out of bed now
Why do I come so close expecting to control?
Everyone around me knows
I'm in trouble
I give myself some good advice
To stop thinkin' about it twice
Just get up and show 'em you're worth it
Why do you come so close expecting to control?
Everyone around you knows
You're in trouble
Why do I come so close expecting to control?
Everyone around me knows
I'm in trouble
I'm in troubleEmbed
