Depletion LyricsLifeless in my room
See it turn to gray
It's outside her window
Before it gets too late
I walked by
I walk out there somewhere
And it's only if I'm crying
If I could be your one
Skin it turns too quick
It's outside your brain storm
Before it gets too late
I walked by
I walk out there somewhere
And it's only if I'm crying
All of the time
Make up my mind
Watching in a world
It's about to break
It's outside your window
Before it gets too late
I walked by
I walk out there somewhere
And it's only if I'm crying
All of the time
Make up my mind
I walked by
I walk out there somewhere
And it's only if I'm crying
All of the time
Make up my mindEmbed
