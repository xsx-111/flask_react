Sorts LyricsWhatever starts in my head
Will stay with me to the end
A pleasant life, I don't want
And I'm planning my descent
All around without you
Run around without you
Breathing in my cold
Don't want in you want to know
The wind is like a bitter plan
No one seems to understand
Everyone except you
No one except you
Rush to the cold
My little one
Save me
Believe it
Thought I was done
Question my words
Come around
Terrified of the thought
You can believe it or not
Not sure where I'm gonna stand
When I find it in the end
When I'm standing without you
When I'm standing without you
Wise to your cold
No one's my one
I fell asleep
And fell to my feet
Praying is not my belief
I don't want to be a better one
Won't believe it in the end
I'm not ready for the world you know
Where am I at in the end?
La la la without you
La la la la without you
La la la where's the truth
La la la la where's the truthEmbed
