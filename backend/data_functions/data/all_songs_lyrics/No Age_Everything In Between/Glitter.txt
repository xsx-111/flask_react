Glitter LyricsThoughts surround me
Everywhere I go
I don't fear nothing
Unless it's broke
I got it over
And under your head
Cause I know
That's where we've been
Take it all now
Don't miss a thing
Your human country's
Been conquering
I don't fear God
I don't fear anything at all
Cause I know
That's where I've been
Thoughts are looming
I've been wondering
When is it my turn to get a win
Everyone is out to get you again
But I want you back underneath my skin
Thoughts surround me
Everywhere I go
I don't fear nothing
Unless it's broke
I got it over
And under your head
Cause I know
That's where we've been
Thoughts are looming
I've been wondering
When is it my turn to get a win
Everyone is out to get you again
But I want you back underneath my skin
Thoughts are looming
I've been wondering
When is it my turn to get a win
Everyone is out to get you again
And I want you back underneath my skin
Thoughts are looming
I've been wondering
When is it my turn to get a win
And you feel like everyone is out to get you again
I want you back underneath my skinEmbed
