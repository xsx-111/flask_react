Life Prowler Lyrics
One time is all I need
To know my job's complete
And when I reach into
Myself my past comes true

My life

One time is all I need
To know my job's complete
And when I reach into
Myself my self comes true


I don't got time
I don't got nothing left for you
I don't got time
I don't got nothing left for youEmbed
