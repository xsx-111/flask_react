Skinned LyricsWhatever starts in my head
Will stay with me to the end
A pleasant life, I don't want
And I'm planning my descent
All around without you
Run around without you
Breathing in my cold
Don't want in you want to know
The wind is like a bitter plan
No one seems to understand
Everyone except you
No one except you
Rush to the cold, my little one
Save me, believe it, thought I was done
Question my words, come around
Terrified of the thought
You can believe it or not
Not sure where I'm gonna stand
When I find it in the end
When I'm standing without you
When I'm standing without you
Wise to your cold, no one's my one
I fell asleep and fell to my feet
Praying is not my belief
I don't want to be a better oneEmbed
