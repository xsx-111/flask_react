Valley Hump Crash LyricsI went down on my own
I traveled south to leave home
I walked so long. so cold
I must be in heaven so

Watch the new transplant
Overwhelming 
 stuck in my soul
I don't want to go to bed
The sun's still shining in my head
I can't think of anything
That's not following my dream
It's colder when it's 
No more money, no more games
I think I'm leaving everythingEmbed
