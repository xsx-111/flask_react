Snoother LyricsThese phrases
These thoughts
Will come to mind
Of contact
Of stadium capacity
The breach of these terms
Shall not be known
Any slight hints for history
Something common
Something lost
Something gained
Not a curl displaced
Yet something is gained
We are no less removed
Than for that which she is known
We show no less a sign
Of strength
Than she may claim
These phrasings
These thoughts
Will come to mind
Of contact
Of stadium capacity
A breach of these terms
Shall not be known
Nor the warmth or light share with theeEmbed
