Tales (Live from the Crypt) Lyrics
When you make a wish
Upon a star
Doesn’t matter
Who you are
Stark and wondrous our faith so dear
Spun from ashes, strength and fear
Common shapes, familiar souls
Born to terror, sworn to 
Hold me tender now, hold me near
Hold me ‘til I fall from here
This act of sympathy for those deprived
Of will to live but beyond our lives
Do you know it now say it’s real
Is this how you want me to feel
Say it’s possible, what else can you do
I will count all the pleasures for youEmbed
