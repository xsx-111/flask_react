A Tribute To LyricsChild, go back inside
Where is your father now?
The bus for town left days ago
Where is your father now?
Two bullets in a photo from home
Damn them that brought me here
Don't care whose face is on the wall
I'm one of those not death
Desperate days they walk behind
Though you see them, do not look them in the eye
There is no justice
Yes, memory serves for the flies
So we leave our home
Whose moon is it shines down on me
On the roofs they call our homes?
Whose guards is it keeps watch on me
To ensure our blood will run?
Unreturned, the letters I sent
My only hope to rest the tears
When night comes I will learn while they sleep
To satisfy their failuresEmbed
