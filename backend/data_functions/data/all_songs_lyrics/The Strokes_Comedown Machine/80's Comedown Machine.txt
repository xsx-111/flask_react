80's Comedown Machine Lyrics
It's not the first time
That I've watched you
Passing by
I've tried too hard
To get back there
But, youâ€™re not on time
Anymore
Tried to get in with you
For a second time
You said the world's closed in
But you crawled in
Back inside

So please
Run away
So please
Run away

I tried to believe in fate
For a second try
It's there in the safe
Why don't you
Close the blinds
For the night
So please
Run away
So please
Run away

So please
Run away
So please
Run away
So please
Run away
Run away18Embed
