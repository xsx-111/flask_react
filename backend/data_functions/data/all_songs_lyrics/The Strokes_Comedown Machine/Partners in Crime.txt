Partners in Crime Lyrics
I forgot your jacket outdoors
Day's been something
See if I care
One; it's not okayish day, just so
But yes, if you insist
Okay

Oh, alright, I know where tonight

Hey there, how goes it?
Any time they're closing?
Might need a lawyer
Let's all be honest
Where there's a forest
We don't belong

Pleased to get who's standing around
Life forgives you when you rebound
See my friend locked up at the zoo
Why aren't we leaving town right now?

Oh, alright, I know where tonight
I'm on the guestlist
We got the door, but
Can't seem to find it
Pants on a tiger
Winter is white and
I won't be here buzzing


Oh well
Oh well
Oh well, leaving your tears alone
Runs down your face and escapes

Hey there, how goes it?
Any time they’re closing
You’ll need a lawyer
Let’s all be honest
We’re in a forest
We don’t belong
I’m on the guestlist
No need to welcome
Can’t seem to find it
March to the war drum
Tigers have pants on
We have no guns
Thank you for staying
What are you saying?
I won’t forget10Embed
