Fast Animals Lyrics
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah, you don't have to be so loud
Everyone can hear you in this whole damn crowd
Don't have to try so hard
I think they got the message, you were out of your mind

It's not so good to see you this upset
But the next generation will forget

They're always scared of where their daughters been
Cause who knows, they could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again
Is it gone? Gone?

Don't have to lick my face
Everyone can see that you're a psycho in displace

That the next generation will forget
Where their daughter's been
Or who knows they could be alone with men
They're never gonna let you understand
Or show you what it is to be a man
You don't wanna sit down and talk and hear
You don't think anyone is in your ear
I never wanna see your face accused
It's no one's fault
Is it gone? Gone?

They're always scared of where their daughter's been
Cause who knows, they could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's gone5Embed
