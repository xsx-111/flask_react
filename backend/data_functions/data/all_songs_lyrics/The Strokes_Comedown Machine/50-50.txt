50/50 LyricsWhy's she telling me the story of her life?
All the things you wanna kill will give you spite
And if you've taken all the prisoners inside
As they're doling out their wisdom in the fire
I will say!
I will say don't judge me!
I will say!
I will say don't judge me!
I wait on a darkened highway!
I wait on a darkened highway!
I can take as long as without looking by
Why's she telling me the story of her life
And if you've taken all the prisoners inside
As they've thrown all their wisdom in the fire
I will say!
I will say don't judge me!
I will say!
I will say don't judge me!
I wait on a darkened highway!
I wait on a darkened highway!
On pace to tie Dan Nickton's record for the worst foul shooter in the history of the playoffs
I will say!
I will say don't judge me!
I will say!
I will say don't judge me!
I wait on a darkened highway!
I wait on a darkened highway!6Embed
