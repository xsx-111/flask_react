Little Baby Lyrics
Little baby, baby me

In my heart you are the one
Look around and have your fun

Oh woh woh-woh
You be my little baby
And baby me

Little baby can you see
What your love has going to be?
Can you see love in my eyes?
Love that leaves me full of sighs



Maybe I will baby you
With a bunch of love for you
