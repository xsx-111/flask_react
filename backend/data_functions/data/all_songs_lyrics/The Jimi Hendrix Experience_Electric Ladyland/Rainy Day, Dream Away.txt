Rainy Day, Dream Away Lyrics
Hey man, take a look out the window and see what's happening
Hey man, it's raining
It's raining outside man
Aw, don't worry about that
Everything's going to be everything
We'll get into something real nice you know
Sit back and groove on a rainy day
Yeah, yeah I see what you mean brother, lay back and groove

Rainy day, dream away
Ah let the sun take a holiday
Flowers bathe an' ah see the children play
Lay back and groove on a rainy day

Well, I can see a bunch of wet creatures, look at them on the run
The carnival traffic noise it sings the tune splashing up and
Even the ducks can groove rain bathing in the park side pool
And I'm leaning out my windowsill digging everything
And you too

Rainy day, rain all day
Ain't no use in gettin' uptight, just let it groove its own way
Let it drain your worries away
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day2Embed
