Try Whistling This LyricsTales from my head
Can't buy the book
No one's listening
But I guess you could
Try whistling this
You say you're tired
Liquid as water
But you'll succumb now
As I stroke your back
I'm the best that you know
And every time you think of me
I hope you're thinking true romance
And every time you want to leave
You'll give us both another chance
Warmest welcome
Violent stranger
He said come here
As he pushed me down
Impossible to do
In high heels
Walking into walls
Ever wondered
If you're here at all?
Try whistling this
And my words are ringing in your ears
Drawing your attention now to all the things that you ignore
If I can't be with you, I would rather have a different face
If I can't be near you, I would rather be adrift in space
And if the gods desert us now, I'll turn this chapel into flames
And if someone tries to hurt you, I will put myself in your placeEmbed
