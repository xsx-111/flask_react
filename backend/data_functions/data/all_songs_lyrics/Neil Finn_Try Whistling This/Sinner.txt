Sinner LyricsSee it anyone got my eyes got my face
Sing it everyone got my nose got my blood
Conscience plays upon me now
Safe until my luck runs out
Cuckoos call, pendulum swings
I thought you knew everything
Lift my hands, make the cross
Sinner, I have never learned
Beginner, I cannot return
Forever, I must walk this earth
Like some forgotten soldier
These things, I should keep to myself
But I feel somehow strangely compelled
Under moonlight, I stood wild and naked
Felt no shame just my spirit awakened
Sinner
Seein' everything
Got my eyes got my face
Fireball drop from the sky
All my dreams have come to pass
Where's my faith, is it lost
Can't see it 'til you cast it off
Sinner, there is no such thing
Beginner, I have learned to sing
Forever, I must walk this earth like some forgotten soldier
Today, I am still disconnected
To the face that I saw in the clouds
And the closest I get to contentment
Is when all of the barriers come down
These things I should keep to myself
But I feel somehow strangely compelled
And the closest I get to contentment
Is when all of the barriers come down
Sinner
Sinner
Got my eyes, got my face
Seein' anyone
Got my nose, got my blood
(I must walk this earth)
Seein' anyone
Got my eyes, got my faceEmbed
