Identical Twin LyricsBeware late night thinking
Before starlight's over
The world has been shaken
Rain
I felt myself sinking
And you lay above me
Identical twin
Beware violent mood swing
Before I can stop it
The word has been spoken
Rain
I felt myself sinking
And you lay above me
The earth drew me in
Identical twin
Some say that's good
That you can be certain
You did all you could
Leave all your questions
I felt myself sinking
And you lay above me
My high flying one
My light fingered foe
My life filled below
It's all coming back
It's all going backEmbed
