Dream Date LyricsRemove yourself from the past
Wherever you are, you don't have to stay
Old and wise, lion's eyes
I wish you were here to give me advice
Light-weight dream date
Fly or fall, its my call
In the club, halfway up
Whiskey at five, a weekend retreat
Brave and young, the bells have rung
You're playing the tune, I'm tapping my feet
Light-weight dream date
Fly or fall, its my call
Light-weight dream date
Fly or fall, its my call
Friend or foe, its hard to know
I wish you were here to give me advice
Light-weight dream date
Fly or fall, its my call
Light-weight dream date
Fly or fall, its my callEmbed
