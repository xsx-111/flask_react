Truth LyricsRemember who we are
Supple and new
If I lose my way
You tell me the truth for all its worth
Lifting up your hand, show me, i rescue
What i said
Truth is worth more than pride
Truth is worth more than pride
Everything you do continues long after you've gone
Circle overheard
View from the bed
So high I'm lonely
Sixteen times a day
He comes to ground
To get some attention
What I said
Truth is worth more than pride
Truth just cannot be denied
Truth is worth more than pride
Where you've showered me with riches
If they say that I am worthy of their love and their attention
But they still don't know the truth
Everything you do continues long after you've gone
What I said
Truth is worth more than pride
Truth cannot be denied
Truth is worth more than pride
View from the bed
So high I'm lonely
So high I'm lonely
Truth, worth more than pride
Hey
View from my bed
So high I'm lonely
So high I'm lonelyEmbed
