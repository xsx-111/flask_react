Addicted LyricsHear the words a jumble, try this tongue twister
Kevin has a caterpillar squeezed between his fingers
Hear the mailman come, see what he delivers
And you wait
And it makes you feel strange
As if you were afraid
And you lie
With a look to the side
And you say
I was addicted to the drug
But now I know when I've had enough
Could curl up and sleep on the floor
But I'm riding the train a hundred miles an hour
It feels like this train might never stop
Watching static on the television
When the morning comes
And you wait
And it makes you feel strange
As if you are deranged
With a look to the side
And you say
I was addicted to the drug
But now I know when I've had enough
So far, you've come so far
You've come so far
We've come so farEmbed
