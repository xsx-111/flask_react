She Will Have Her Way LyricsI might be old but I'm someone new she said
I'm so sore that I could cry always
In the night lay your tired arms
She will have her way
But somehow I will still believe her
She's the life I've been frightened of
Seems like deathly silence and especially the dark
Feels like I am heavy and my spirit has died
She will have her way
But somehow I will still believe her
She will have her way
And one day I will come back
Yeah
Do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Still no end in sight
Though I travel far and wide
A dying man is doing time
Thinker, soldier terrified
She will have her way
Somehow I will still believe her
She will have her way
One day I will come back
Do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do
Do do do
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah
(Hey)
She will have her way
(...)
Yeah she will have her way
She will have her way1Embed
