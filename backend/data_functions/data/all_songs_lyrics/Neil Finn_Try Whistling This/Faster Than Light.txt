Faster Than Light LyricsClose your eyes
Go to sleep
Close your eyes
Get so dizzy
The world is spinning
In your bed
I know where the sun goes
It's waking up the sparrows
In England it's morning
In time, you'll see that some things travel faster than light
In time you'll recognise that love is larger than life
Now you know what you're missing
Now you've seen that I'm willing
If you're looking for the message
Close your eyes
Do you hear what I'm thinking?
Is it how you've imagined?
In time you'll see that some things travel faster than light
In time you'll recognise that love is larger than life
And praise will come to those whose kindness
Leaves you without debt
And bends the shape of things that haven't happened yet
Close your eyes
Colours changing like a lizard
Close your eyes
I know where the sun goes
I have seen the world turning
In time you'll find that some things travel faster than light
In time you'll recognise that love is larger than life
And praise will come to those whose kindness
Leaves you without debt
And bends the shape of things to come that haven't happened yetEmbed
