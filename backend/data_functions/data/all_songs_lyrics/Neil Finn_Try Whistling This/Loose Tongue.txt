Loose Tongue LyricsRemember my loose tongue
Forget what I just said
I'll crawl over broken glass
If we could start again
Before our plans were made
When the world was young
The house was falling down
Because of my loose tongue
I shouldn't say so much
I shouldn't talk so loud
It's sooner on your lips
And it's all over town
In all our given days
How many gone to waste
A good man has been hung
Because of my loose tongue
Your skin is changing its hue
Your god is coming down fast
Looks like someone I knew
Uncovered happiness at last
And all the wagging tongues
Too much information
In the future now
Under massive doubt
The papers on the street
Get trampled under feet
And they settle for a princely sum
Good will is coming down
And when it rains
Your well is full
You shouldn't ask me, shouldn't ask me
You want the real story, shouldn't ask me
You better find someone else with the house key
You know impression on his personal life
You know the man's walking on the edge of a knife
Your tail is getting long and your nose keeps growing
Perhaps some time you forget what you know and
Now I feel I'm getting caught with a psycho sycophant
And ... a kicked out tin can
Got the poor man nailed to the floor
And that's not enough when you wanna beat more
He's only halfway through his life
He's only used up all his timeEmbed
