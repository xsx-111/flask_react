King Tide LyricsIt's a dark and empty room
The sun beating hard on your door
Feel emotion roar within you
You're flesh and blood like anyone
Make some sense of your life
Move your hand and make the mark
I don't know why you're so confused
You're flesh and blood, there's no excuse
And the hunger inside
Won't go away, it's starting to rise
And the longer you hide
The more you deny
And the sea rushes in
The wind is howling at your back
The past is always overturned
It's a dead man who would refuse
And twice the man to fill his shoes
And the hunger inside
Won't go away it's starting to rise
And the longer you hide
The more you deny
And the hunger inside
Won't go away it's starting to rise
And the sea rushes in
Into my world
I can feel the king tide coming
All my senses overflowing
One night waiting out the back
Horns'll blow and cymbals crash
So paint a circle in the sky
I lay breathless in the arms of love
There's a bruise on my back
And a new understanding tooEmbed
