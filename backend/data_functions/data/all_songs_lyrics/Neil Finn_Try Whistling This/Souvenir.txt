Souvenir LyricsDon't ask the question
You won't like the answer
Get up off your chair
There's nothing for you here
Where the guests like souvenirs
They play with you 'till you're all worn out
Back where the guests like souvenirs
Prison color blue
It's a uniform of choice
Count yourself lucky
That you don't write the software
Where the guests like souvenirs
They play with you 'till you're all worn out
Back where the guests like photographs
They hope you had a good night
Loosen up your tie
Make the viewers cry
I cannot pretend to cry
Memorise by heart
Every single part
There's nothing for you here
Where the guests like souvenirs
They play with you 'till you're all worn out
Back where the guests like souvenirs
They hope you had a good nightEmbed
