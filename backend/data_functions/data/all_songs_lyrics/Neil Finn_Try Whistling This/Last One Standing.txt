Last One Standing LyricsHand me down my favourite coat
Show what you're made of, surprise us both
Fly in the night, slow down town
Brake too fast, and bring us round, bring us round
And the finest days have come
Summer nights go on so long
So high I might as well be gone
And you are magnificent
And I can see you with my eyes closed
You're the last one standing
Lean and hungry with a fire in your eyes
I'll play catch up, you can show me where it's at
I'll go along with anything that you want to do
Every day I'm making ground
So high I might as well be gone
And you are magnificent
And I can see you with my eyes closed
When you're walking into my house
I'll be the last one standing
If you want you can get there
Night vision can I find your
White doves land in your treasure tower
And I promise that I won't look back
Every day I'm making ground
So high I might as well be gone
And you are magnificent
And I can see you with my eyes closed
When you're walking into my house
I'll be the last one standing
And you are magnificent
And I can see you with my eyes closed
When you're walking into my house
I'll be the last one standingEmbed
