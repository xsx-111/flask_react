Pain and Pleasure Lyrics
I want to tell you, hey I think you ought to know
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have to go
I've heard the rumors and it seems they're coming true
You do what suits you, but then that's nothing new

Do what you wanna do
Oh, what you put me through
How I suffer for your love
And say what you want to say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried

You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what I like

You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messing round, practice what you preach
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way I see it, oh, we're dead or we're alive
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what I like

Do what you wanna do
Oh, what you put me through
How I suffer for your love
And say what you want to say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried

You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what I like
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what I likeEmbed
