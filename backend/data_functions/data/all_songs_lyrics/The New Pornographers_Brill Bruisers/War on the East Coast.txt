War on the East Coast Lyrics
Last night I dreamt
Vancouver dressed up in the ocean
Last night I dreamt
Victoria drowned in the ocean
The ride of a lifetime
The rites of spring of a lifetime
The ride of a lifetime
The rites of spring of a lifetime

Blondes, brunettes, paper jets
Blondes, brunettes, paper jets
Star power, star power
The king bends over to smell a flower

I wanted to go home with you
I wanted to stay true to the cause
But look what we're living in
It's war on the east coast
It's war out west
Oh, I don't care
I don't care
It's war on the east coast
It's war out west
Oh, I don't care
I don't care
Blondes, brunettes, paper jets
Blondes, brunettes, paper jets
My getaway bag
I worked on it all day
A girl on a motorbike goes the wrong way
Wild gypsy ship
Never knew what hit 'er

I wanted to go home with you
I wanted to stay true to the cause
But look what we're living in
It's war on the east coast
It's war out west
Oh, I don't care
I don't care
It's war on the east coast
It's war out west
Oh, I don't care
I don't care

I wanted to go home with you
I wanted to stay true to the cause
But look what we're living in
It's war on the east coast
It's war out west
Oh, I don't care
I don't care
It's war on the east coast
It's war out west
Oh, I don't care
I don't care
It's war on the east coast
It's war out west
Oh, I don't care
I don't care
It's war on the east coast
It's war out west
Oh, I don't care
I don't care
It's war on the east coast4Embed
