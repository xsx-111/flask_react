Wide Eyes Lyrics
I'm overlooking the canyon
Right from where I'm standing swear I
See my former glory still burning
It had every intent of returning
I've been years here planning the landing
To prepare for jumping the canyon
It's not the death-defying or cheering
It's the thrill of clearing, barely clearing

And if I see no hope for me
I still see hope for you
In the high rise of the morning
The exception that proves my rule

And still I'm tying up loose ends
I tie them to a chair to defy them
To protect and hide them, untie them
These are not the ones you want, untie 'em
And now I'm jumping the canyon
After years of planning and planning
It's a monumental challenge of feeling
You must fight before you start free-wheeling
And if I see no hope for me
I still see hope for you
In the wide eyes of the morning
The exception that proves my rule

And if I see no hope for me
I still see hope for you
In the high rise of the morning
The exception that proves my rule

Proves my rule
Proves my rule
Proves my rule
Proves my ruleEmbed
