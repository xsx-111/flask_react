You Tell Me Where Lyrics
Take a breather, they came for Caesar
But I don't think he's here, Desiderata
Is that your name now? Glad you came out
You've proved your poison is more than noise
And the joy's addictive although restrictive
Fair baby beware, I'm not always square

Old friends from the last call
Searching a glass for
Some famous last words
Learned from the master

With all your shit-talking, all your blue stocking
And your spellcheck, you want some hell? Check!
Direct your own pace, you need your own place
So you tell me where to be, I'll be there
A little seasick, I feel you falling
Napkins crawled in me, I'm all in

Old friends from the last call
Searching a glass for
Some famous last words
Learned from the master
You see my range, you could change me if you wanted to
Just rearrange a few pieces and run
If there's no way but the high road, save me
If there's an easy so leave me, don't leave me
I think I could change to become what you want me
To think we could finally be done
I think I could change to become what you want me
To think we could finally be done

So you tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
So you tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be there
You tell me where to be, I'll be thereEmbed
