Dancehall Domine Lyrics
They love you with the lights on
Repeat it, recite it
Whenever you feel gentle
Whenever you'll be knighted
Some will have to brave the line
But they're letting you right in

They love you with the lights on
Turn them on or don't bother
Never been so loved but you're handling it well, lover
Just like every idea was to be like no other

What we call the dancehall domine
Embedded, indebted, don't let it
No never let it be said
We call the dancehall domine
You're covered in credits, don't let it
No never let it be said

I've got, got the floor
Now I've got, got the floor
In the heart, in the heart, in the heart, in the heart
They love you with the lights on
Defeated, delighted
Never say the right thing
So keep it excited
You don't have to brave the line
No, they're letting you right in

What we call the dancehall domine
Embedded, indebted, don't let it
No never let it be said
We call the dancehall domine
You're covered in credits, don't let it
No never let it be said

I've got, got the floor
Now I've got, got the floor
In the heart, in the heart, in the heart, in the heart

What we call the dancehall domine
Embedded, indebted, don't let it
No never let it be said
We call the dancehall domine
You're covered in credits, don't let it
No never let it be said
I've got, got the floor
Now I've got, got the floor
I've got, got the floor
Now I've got, got the floor
In the heart, in the heart, in the heart, in the heart1Embed
