Hi-Rise Lyrics
Wee hours on the move
All eyes in the night
Are concentrated and glowing
An explosion effect

Walking on the roof
Of the hi-rise on the moon
You never go where you're going
But, for once, there's room

You're much harder to place
Now that you are floating untethered in space
Unfolded into madrigals
Unfolded into madrigals
What you want is madness, though
What you want is madness, though

Walking on the roof
Of a hi-rise here to stay
Experiment in levitation
A psychic left to pray
You're much harder to place
Now that you are floating untethered in space
Unfolded into madrigals
Unfolded into madrigals
What you want is madness, though
What you want is madness, thoughEmbed
