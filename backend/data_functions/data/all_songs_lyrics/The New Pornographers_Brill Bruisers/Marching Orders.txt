Marching Orders Lyrics
What do these marching orders mean?
Some half-lit fairy tale, I'd move out their dreams
It's what they do, step one-two
Marching ten paces in front of you

Let's put this countdown clock away
Unfinished parts of the death ray on the lawn
Let them rust, turn to dust
What the heart can't imagine and trust

They, they say we can't make this stuff up
But what else could we make?
They say we can't make this stuff up
But what else could we make?

What do these marching orders say?
Spelled out in now-forgotten language, they leave
Your voice wept, don't connect
What the fuse was put there to protect

They, they say we can't make this stuff up
But what else could we make?
They say we can't make this stuff up
But what else could we make?
Come on, really lose your voice
Come on, really lose it
Come on, really lose your voice
Come on, really lose it

They, they say we can't make this stuff up
But what else could we make?
They say we can't make this stuff up
But what else could we make?
They, they say we can't make this stuff up
But what else could we make?
They say we can't make this stuff up
But what else could we make?

No, your marching orders stay
Always despised so many ways so they'll know
We won't go, so hell no
We won't go, so hell no
We won't go, so hell no
We won't goEmbed
