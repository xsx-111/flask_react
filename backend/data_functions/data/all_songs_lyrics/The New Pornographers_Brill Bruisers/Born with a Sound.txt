Born with a Sound Lyrics
There's death in the bread line, there's death on the vine
I wanted you quite often in that I wanted you all of the time
I've been up all night, I've been up all day

I was into the illusion, I was into the never ending scene
And the sound of confusion in the willow's eye
I've been up all night, I've been up all day
Singing the mistress' Tanqueray

I had a sound in my head
But I couldn't find the words to get it out
Now I know love is the way
Get it out
I had a sound in my head
But I couldn't find the words to get it out
Now I know love is the way
Get it out
Get it out

I see death in the bread line, I see death on the vine
I want you quite often, I want you all of the time
I heard a sound in my head and I couldn't get it out, get it out
I've been up all night, I've been up all day
I was born with a sound, I was born with a sound
I was born with a sound, I was born with a sound
I was born with a sound
(I've been up all night)
I was born with a sound
(I've been up all day)
(I was born with a sound)
(I was born with a sound)
(I was born with a sound)
I was born with a sound
(I was born with a sound)
I was born with a sound
(I was born with a sound)Embed
