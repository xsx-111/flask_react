Brill Bruisers Lyrics
Out on the waves
Over the railing asking the crowd
To send you back
To stage instead of sailing away
Been left behind
Looking for searchlights leading the charge
The mass appeal
To brilliant bruisers taking the wheel

And the sea was all lighters
It was all lighters
It's how we know now to never go back

Lob a grenade
I have mere seconds before the bang
Wanted to keep
My job as the leader of your gang
Wanted the hearts
Of brilliant bruisers, where do we find them?
Until we do
We'll have to drift until we divine them

And the sea was all lighters
It was all lighters
It's how we know now to never go back
With the junkyard science
To hang on
And do a bang-on
Impression
Of the young sorrow
It's tied in
A fire in love with sirens
We go in fighting, decrying
The rising star dying
From its own virus, it's tied in
A firing of the sirens

And the sea was all lighters
It was all lighters
And how we know how to never go back
And the sea was all lighters
It was all lighters
It's how we know now to never go back2Embed
