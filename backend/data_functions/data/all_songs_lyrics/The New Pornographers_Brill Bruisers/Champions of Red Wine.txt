Champions of Red Wine Lyrics
We are champions of red wine
We're poured all over
It's what we're known for
The fine art of crossed lines
Crossed for old times
Like starting over

Oh like the headlands
Need waves to root for
You're coming over
You've done your research
It has the force of water
And we've got a lot here

The steps I take back to you
The steps I take back to you

I think we could save lives
If we don't spend them
Way undercover
I am not your love song
Love song gone wrong
I'm coming over
The steps I take back to you
The steps I take back to you

We are champions of red wine
We're poured all over
And we're coming over, we're coming over, we're coming overEmbed
