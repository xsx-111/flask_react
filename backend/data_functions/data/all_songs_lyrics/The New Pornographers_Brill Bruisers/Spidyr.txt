Spidyr Lyrics
So you wanted to go towards the street life
But the city at night was not for you
Your mind saw sparks, mine saw stars
We play games, we play guitars
I don't know where you are but I'm coming

Spidyr
Spidyr
Spidyr

Your mind saw sparks, mine saw stars
We were playing games, playing guitars
I don't know, I don't know

Spidyr
They want you, they want you, they want you
They want you, they want you, they want you
They want you, they want you, they want you (Fuck!)
They want you, they want you, they want youEmbed
