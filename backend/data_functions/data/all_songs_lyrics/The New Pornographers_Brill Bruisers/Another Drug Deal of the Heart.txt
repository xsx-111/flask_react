Another Drug Deal of the Heart LyricsWe can't send it back, pretend it's yours, 'cause then it will be
It will still be cracked
Are you sure we bought the right thrill here?
It's a drug deal of the heart
It's a drug deal of the heart
Don't meet me here, just meet me out on that corner stop
I wanna pay you here, let's treat it more like being sworn in
And not like a drug deal of the heart
Like a drug deal of the heart
An drug deal of the heart
It's a drug deal of the heart
It's a drug deal of the heart
It's a drug deal of the heart1Embed
