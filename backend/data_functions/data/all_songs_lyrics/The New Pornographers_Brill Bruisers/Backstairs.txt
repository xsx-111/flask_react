Backstairs Lyrics
Taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs
Taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs

Before I knew to choose the music of celebrity
I sang backups on the backstairs, the backstairs, the backstairs (Taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs)
I wore out grooves sneaking around the servants' quarters, so
So I knew my way around the backstairs

There is another West, you'll find out
It's nearly thunderous
There is another West, much wilder
You feel it under us
And yet another West, a new one when you arrive

I move so slow, I didn't know that I was backing out
It was getting packed out on the backstairs, the backstairs, the backstairs

And I came, and I saw, and I ran, and I won
And I came, and I saw, and I ran, and I won
And I came, and I saw, and I ran, and I won
There is another West, you'll find out
It's nearly thunderous
There is another West, much wilder
You feel it under us
And yet another West, a new one when you arrive
Another West, a new one when you arrive

Taking the backstairs
Taking the backstairs
Taking the backstairs
Taking the backstairs
And I came, and I saw, and I ran, and I won
(Taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs)
Taking the backstairs
Taking the backstairs
And I came, and I saw, and I ran, and I won
(Taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs)
Taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs
Taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs
Taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs
I knew my way around the backstairs
Taking the backstairs, taking the backstairs...Embed
