That Is All Lyrics
That is all I want to say
Our love could save the day
That is all I'm waiting for
To try to love you more

That is all I want to do
To get right next to you
That is all I'm living for
Your love and nothing more
And that is all

Times I find it hard to say
With useless words getting in my way
Silence often says much more
Than trying to say what's been said before

That is all I want from you
A smile when I feel blue
That is all I'm waiting for
Your love and nothing more
And that is all
Silence often says much more
Than trying to say what's been said before

But that is all I want to do
To give my love to you
That is all I'm living for
Please let me love you more
And that is allEmbed
