Sue Me, Sue You Blues Lyrics
And you serve me and I'll serve you
Swing your partners, all get screwed
Bring your lawyer and I'll bring mine
Get together and we could have a bad time

It's affidavit swearing time
Sign it on the dotted line
Hold your Bible in your hand
Now all that's left is to find yourself a new band

We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues


We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues

Hold the block on money flow
I move it into joint escrow
Court receiver, laughs and thrills
But in the end we just pay those lawyers their bills
And you serve me and I'll serve you
Swing your partners, all get screwed
Bring your lawyer and I'll bring mine
Get together and we could have a bad time

We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
Sue me, sue you blues
I'm tired of playing the sue me, sue you bluesEmbed
