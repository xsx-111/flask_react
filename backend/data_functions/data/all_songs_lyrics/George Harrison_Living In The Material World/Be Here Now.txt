Be Here Now Lyrics
Remember now, be here now
As it's not like it was before
The past was, be here now
As it's not what it was before it was

Why try to live a life
That isn't real
No how
A mind that wants to wander
'Round a corner
Is an unwise mind

Now is, be here now
And it's not what it was before
Remember now, be here now
As it's not like it was before it wasEmbed
