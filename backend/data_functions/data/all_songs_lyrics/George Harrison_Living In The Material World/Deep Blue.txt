Deep Blue Lyrics
When sunshine is not enough to make me feel bright
It's got me suffering in the darkness
That's so easy come by on the roadside
Of one long lifetime

It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue

When you stand there, watch tired bodies
Full of sickness and pain
To show you just how helpless you really are
When you get down to the truth it hurts me

It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue


Got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
When I think of the life I'm living
Pray God help me, give me your light
So I can love you and understand this repetition
That keeps me here feeling deep blue

You know I'm deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
You know I'm deep blue

When sunshine is not enough to make me feel bright
It's got me suffering in the darkness
That's so easy come by on the roadside
Of one long lifetime

You know I'm deep blue
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blueEmbed
