Who Can See It Lyrics
I've been held up, I've been run down
I can see quite clearly now
Through those past years
When I played towing the line

I only ask, that what I feel
Should not be denied me now
As it's been earned, and I have seen
My life belongs to me
My love belongs to who can see it

I've lived in fear, I've been out there
I've been around and seen my share
Of this sad world and all the hate that it's stirred

I only ask that what I know
Should not be denied me now
As it's been learned and I have seen
My life belongs to me
My love belongs to who can see it

I only ask, that what I feel
Should not be denied me now
As it's been earned, and I have seen
My life belongs to me
My love belongs to who can see it

My love belongs to whoEmbed
