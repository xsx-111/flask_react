Fingers Lyrics
Ah, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha
Yeah, mhmm
Mmh, uh

I’m alone now
Staring at the ceiling
I’m kinda bored now
I can’t sleep (I can't sleep)
And you only can make my life complete
And when you come you slip into a dream

When it's late at night and you're fast asleep
I let my fingers do the walking
I press record, I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
I let my fingers do the walking

I'm starving
For some attention
I'm begging, pleading, bleeding
For a suggestion
I bite my tongue because I wanna scream
I'm almost there and you turn and look at me
When it's late at night and you're fast asleep
I let my fingers do the walking
I press record, I become a fiend
And no one else is watching (I let my fingers do the walking)

Rewind and you will see (You will see)
Why in the morning I'm happy (I'm happy)
Right there on the TV screen (On the TV)
(¡ME VENGO, ME VENGO!)

I'm restless
You need some caffeine
I'm wasted
If you could only see (Only see)
'Cause I need more than you are gonna give

When it's late at night and you're fast asleep
I let my fingers do the walking (Ahh)
I press record, I become a fiend
And no one else is watching (No, no, no, no)
When it's late at night and you're fast asleep
I let my fingers do the walking (I let my fingers do the walking)
I press record I become a fiend
And no one else is watching (No one else is watching)
(I let my fingers do the walking)
(I let my fingers do the walking)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, uh, uh, uh, huh1Embed
