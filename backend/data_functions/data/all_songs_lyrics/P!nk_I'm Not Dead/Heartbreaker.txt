Heartbreaker Lyrics
I keep thinking 'bout that little sparkle in your eye
Is it a light from the angels, or your devil deep inside?
What about the way you say you love me all the time?
Are you lifting me up to heaven, just to drop me down the line?
There's a ring around my finger, but will you change your mind?
And you tell me that I'm beautiful, but that could be a lie

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
What if I'm falling for a heartbreaker?
And everything is just a lie
I won't be leaving here alive
I won't be leaving here alive, no

Temporary happiness is like waiting for the knife
'Cause I'm always watching for someone to show their darker side
So maybe I'll sit back and just enjoy all this for now
Watch it all play out, see if you really stick around
There's always this one question that keeps me up at night
Are you my greatest love or disappointment in my life?

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
What if I'm falling for a heartbreaker?
And everything is just a lie
I won't be leaving here alive
I might as well lay down and die
I'm holding on with both hands and both feet, oh
Promise that you won't pull the rug out from under me

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
I pray to God you're not a heartbreaker
This time around, I won't survive
'Cause if I'm falling for a heartbreaker
And everything is just a lie
I won't be leaving here alive
I might as well lay down and die, oh
I won't be leaving here aliveEmbed
