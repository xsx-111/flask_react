Different Strings Lyrics
Who's come to slay the dragon?
Come to watch him fall?
Making arrows out of pointed words
Giant killers at the call
Too much fuss and bother
Too much contradiction and confusion
Peel away the mystery
Here's a clue to some real motivation

All there really is: the two of us
And we both know why we've come along
Nothing to explain, it's a part of us
To be found within a song

What happened to our innocence?
Did it go out of style?
Along with our naivete
No longer a child
Different eyes see different things
Different hearts beat on different strings
But there are times for you and me
When all such things agree
All there really is: the two of us
And we both know why we've come along
Nothing to explain, it's a part of us
To be found within a song
