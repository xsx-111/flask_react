Springful Lyrics
A foolish bathe, a foolish bathe
Did I did I did I did I did I did I, did a foolish bathe?
My sugar veins, my sugar veins
Did I did I did I did I did I did I, did my sugar veins?
The foolish bathe? The foolish bathe?
Did I did I did I did I did I did I, did the foolish bathe?
My sugar veins, my sugar veins
My my my my my my my sugar veins

Right eye honour, coat of armour
And I’m proud
With my left eye
Dreams are leadlike
And I’m down
Still a lover, but no further
Than the borders
Still all over, but for sugar
In my veins

I was too busy pacing
Now what did I say? 

So let us joy up and be springful
Your provision is more than a mouthful
So let us joy up and be praiseful
Your provision is more than a faceful
Right eye honour, coat of armour
And I’m proud
With my left eye
Dreams are leadlike
And I’m down
Still a lover, but no further
Than the borders
Still all over, but for sugar
In my veins

So let us joy up and be thankful
Your provision is more than a handful
Houdini never knew how he did it
Broke the tomb and he hammered the death knellEmbed
