Be A Girl LyricsI know my speeches are buttered up
I know no nudge that's neat enough
It’s dull to say:
“I hope you tread where every
Strike is carpeted”
Its dull to, well I do!
Yes I bit down roughly on
“Not so well”
Bold claim to taste a feel in felt!
To Hamm it up the hearts a sore
For babies sake
And nothing more
But equally there’s a need
For being soppy on a hilltop
The main character
Who carries the plot with him
And twitches as it thickens
Who can sting when stung
And uncork the pores!
And if maleness won't sob
Then be a girl!1Embed
