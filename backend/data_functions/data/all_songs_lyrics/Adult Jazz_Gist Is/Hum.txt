Hum LyricsThe police are gonna wound me
And the minister will heal me
But I think he’ll do it equally
Violently
Should I ask him to?
Should I ask him to?
Should I ask him to?
Should I ask him to?
Only one, only one will lay claim to me
Only one, only one will choicelessly be sung
Police say no!
Police say no!
Police say no!
Police say no!
I cannot spare a thought
I cannot spare a thought
Spare thought, spare thought
Spare thought
Was I born a roach?
A belly-crawling grub?
Just as I suppose
I hear a holy hum of:
Dust thy essence off!
You are gladly so!
You are biting none!
Softest teeth I know!
It’s in the artist soul!
It's in there I should know!
In all my decent days!
It was in everyone!
A love that isn’t waiting
On my shook soul
At the nave and at the navel
Him I know
Been a little leaden lately
He can’t bite down on my soul
At least he eats the bread crumbs
That I throw!
Lay loose - it’s all I’d ever do
Forever!
God loves the aching ones
He loves the aching ones
Police said they’d cut things off
Am I an aching one?
It’s a limb that I’d like to offer
It’s a limb that I’d like to lose
I don’t care about fools and father
It’s a limb that I’d like to lose2Embed
