Pigeon Skulls LyricsAll that I know
Is dust when they go
Thought in the dock
(that isn’t all)
All I ask is a “so warm!” home
Like I won't
Oh! We had arms they bit the ends
Oh! And what was a lot like them
They know  in those longish
Summer days, dulled
We were at the perfect age
Born - kept below
Just strung along
Too loose to settle
(that isn’t all)
All I ask is a “so warm!” home
Like I won't
Oh! We had arms they bit the ends
Oh! And that was a lot like them
They know - in those longish
Summer days, dulled
We were at the perfect age
Distant warblings round my
Deathbed
They kick ass! But my heart is a
Bird
That should feast now
