Bonedigger LyricsWe clipped the tail and he does not
Forget
And cut his claws to kitchen feet
Here is a mark of my legless
Interest
A living lump collar and keep
Will it hold your hand?
Feel the wounds that I have?
Bonedigger
His heart in the valley!
I never
His heart in the valley!
We cut the claws and he does not
Forget
The simplest unmuzzled way
Now he is packless and human
Instead
No common tongue or thing to say!
We split the litter and he does not
Forget
Sleeping in piles and nuzzling
Once we decided which creature to
Get
His useless mother she did
Nothing!
Will it hold you hand?
Feel the wounds that I have?
All of you
All of you eat
All of you
I feast alone
I feast alone
I feast alone
Heâ€™s at the bottom us
Tips the bowl!
He tips the bowl over!
And the pat hand could convey
Nothing
And likewise the lick is not love1Embed
