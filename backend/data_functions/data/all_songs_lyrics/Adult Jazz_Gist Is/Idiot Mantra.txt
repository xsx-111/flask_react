Inevermindiwasfull
(I know)
Been humming an idiot mantra so
Long!
Been humming an idiot mantra so
Long!
My heart it is spilling all over the
Drums!
My heart it is spilling all over the
Drums!
Found lice in gold
Hair lice in there
Iron the world is what I want
Folded neater down! Listen!
Been humming an idiot mantra so
Long!
Been humming an idiot mantra so
Long!
My heart it is spilling all over the
Drums!
My heart it is spilling all over the
Drums!
So I get no
So I get no light
So I so I
So I get no
So I get no light
So I so I
So I muddy my shirt in a puddle
Like I had been the busiest thing
So I muddy my shirt in a puddle
But I cannot be stripped of the
Twinge!Embed
