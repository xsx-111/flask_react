Am Gone LyricsI was always a runner
I was always a runner you know
I was always a runner became a
Forgiver
And now I have nothing to show
I was the way you don’t go
I was the way that you never go
I was the way that you never go
Maybe I lied?
And Your house in an eyesore
I sing it and feel half alive
(uhnleleleuhnleleuhnlele)
And the way that you go on
And the way that you go on and on
(uhnleleleuhnleleuhnlele)
Listen lay down what you know
Your back faces the cave mouth so
There’s the sugar!
Get ascetic be a bean!
Thick gloves for everything
That’s the way to sugar a life!
Non-attachment - didn’t wince
No swell-belly - didn’t wince
It’s the way!
If up above some lunch does
Simmer
I cannot spend life fork in
