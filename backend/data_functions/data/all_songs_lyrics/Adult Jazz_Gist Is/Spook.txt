Spook LyricsSpook at the door
I spoke with a whisper
Supersoul
I caught in a window
Said “Bow it down!”
Said “Bow it down on me!”
Spook at the door
I spoke with a whisper
Oh mystic - am I foolish soul?
Oh listen - am I hard to hold?
Spook at the door
I spoke with a whisper
And it leaves the house
Supersoul!
I caught in a window
And it leaves the house
Marked and not faintly so
When brotherism came and placed
A hand on me
And I felt I could not
Un-understand!
But I do and have and I will
And I write these songs to trick god
But I do not take it lightly
And It settled down
In your spine
Everything thickening down in
Your spine
And all the money that I earned
And all the safety
After the stinging it returns
To sit sedately!
But I do and I have and I will
And I write these songs to trick god
But I do not take it lightly
And it’s all in aphorisms
I was just believing myself slowly
And the feeling changed
In tents is where you listen
I was always poking
Round the suburbs
With a heart of glass!
With a heart of glass!
With a heart of glass!
A while back we bonded
In a cold cave with ceiling!
And enough, hush, would you coat up
In one hour?
In your public panic room
We'll be here!
And you're tone deaf, you're an awkward clown
Just wait!
With your weak words and your weaker will
Just wait!
With your northern soul and
Southern hands!
Yeah!
Would you feel full and not much
Else?
Yeah!
(Tongues)
But did you ask for it?
Really ask for it?Embed
