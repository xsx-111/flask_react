Donne Tongue LyricsIt’s a cruel bed you’d make
Where I mate till I feel dry
Till I feel
I I I I
I’d buckle up whittle down all the
Pals I make
Pedal around clamoring for a
Fuck unfazed
It’s his unfeeling nose!
It pokes in everything!
An unlukewarm leaning
Is an artifact of old fur and
Clawing and I do not feel
But there is just one thing to ask
To collar a believer
Are you loose from me?
(Don’t you dare!)
It does if you say it does
Gist is exactly enough
Kept awake and kept alive
By a closeness to the steeple I
Have a weak and idol mind
Drenched in nameless devotion
Be my lawgiver! Be my light!
Be my boy!
I’m the blankest slate to find
If I don’t swallow set me right
If I don’t pin me down -
I’d never mind
I’m a stub and I know when I’m
