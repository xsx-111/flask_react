All Play Rebel LyricsHey, hey! All play rebel!
Managers for battle onwards
Hey, hey! All play rebel!
I see a nice man go as far as he can, so
Hey, hey! All play rebel!
Adornish me in discontent, so
Hey, hey! All play rebel!
Taking from their garbage can
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All play rebel!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All play rebel!
Hey, hey! All play rebel!
Fallen down from the mark again, so
Hey, hey! All play rebel!
No-one gave me anything, so
Hey, hey! All play rebel!
A passing foal has lost his way, you go
Hey, hey! All play rebel!
I take what I can cause the going is good!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All play rebel!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All play rebel!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All play rebel!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All play rebel!
Ahh! All play rebel!
Tell me something!
Something new!
Something new!
All play rebel!Embed
