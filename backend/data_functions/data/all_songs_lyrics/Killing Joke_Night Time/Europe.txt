Europe LyricsTake up your arms pick up your courage
A black sun is rising as the gods of Europe sleep
Come back into your strength awaken
Catastrophes atrocities shall summon you my love
Glory glory how we wait in Europe
What have they done, what are they doing?
The place I love so butchered, ravaged, scarred and raped
The years have passed us still we're fighting
'til once again somewhere green lands shall be in sight
Glory glory how we wait in Europe
Glory glory how we watch in Europe
The day humanity is over
Let nations east and west tremble at the sight
'til standard bearers' eyes are hungry
And reason dead forever - god let it be soon
Glory glory how we wait in Europe
Glory glory how we watch in EuropeEmbed
