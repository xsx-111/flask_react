Blue Feather LyricsBehind the iron curtains
Concrete stands
Behind the open door we go
I watched a quill pen for a thousand years
And passion overtook my soul
Ooh, blue feather in my hand
Ooh, blue feather
I passed strange buildings, I saw
Little men and women
Out on the plains, the games begun
New partners for each new dance
Then we change the gown
A famine lasts with many faces
Ooh, blue feather in my hand
Ooh, blue feather
Behind the print I saw a passion never die
A mangy quarter always came
Behind the iron curtains
She whispered softly
"Touch me and make me sane"
Ooh, blue feather in my hand
Ooh, blue feather in my hand
Ooh, blue feather in my hand
Ooh, blue featherEmbed
