Eighties Lyrics
(Ay!)

Aaah
Eighties, I'm living in the eighties
Eighties, I have to push, I have to struggle, oh
Eighties, get out my way, I'm not for sale no more
Eighties, let's kamikaze 'till we get there

And we sang
You do it this way

Aaah
Eighties, by day we run, by night we dance, we do
Eighties, I'm in love with the coming race, oh
Eighties, I've got the best, I'll take all I can get
Eighties, I'm living for the eighties

(Hey, hey, hey) Aaah
And we sang
You do it this way
Aaah
Eighties, I'm living in the eighties, I push
Eighties, I'm living in, oh
Eighties, I'm living in the eighties, I struggle
Eighties, I'm living in, oh, oh

(Hey, hey, hey) Aaah
Eighties, I'm living in, oh
Eighties, I'm living in the eighties, oh-oh-oh
Eighties, I'm living in the eighties, I push
Eighties, push, push, struggle

Aaah
Eighties, I'm living, oh
Eighties, eighties, I'm living
Eighties, I'm living in the eighties, I push
Eighties, push, push, struggle1Embed
