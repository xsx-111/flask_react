Multitudes LyricsThe multitude excites, the flags are flown
By fireside the programme starts
And I am running through this madness
And all the time I can't relate
We sit around in rooms we talk our fears
Asking why we should go on
God I try to make ends meet the best I can
Playing rhythms out of time
Far from the multitudes a few will always stand
They don't fit in they don't belong - move on, move on this way
Within disorder I assume my role
Laugh and cry as I accept
Eternal indolence through ages
'til restless souls begin to wake
Perfection within decades of dissatisfaction and disillusion
A means to no end, a means to no endEmbed
