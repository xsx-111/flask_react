Kings and Queens LyricsWell take it easy
While the world goes crazy
As it's just another day
And we've all been through the mangle
And our pockets are empty
But we'll live like kings and queens
Hear the choirs of noise sing
Take a load off my mind soothe me
Live like kings and queens
Well easy sleazy
In and out and back again
Feel a power running through me
And I'm alive and kicking
I accept submission
To the pleasures of the flesh
And the joy of pain
Satisfy me satisfy
Live like kings and queens
I said take it easy
(In)sanity has come
I can never undo
The wrong of the beginning
There's so many hungry
But I'm gonna turn a blind eye
'Cause I've got to live now
Rejoice and kill your heart 'cause I say
Live like kings and queensEmbed
