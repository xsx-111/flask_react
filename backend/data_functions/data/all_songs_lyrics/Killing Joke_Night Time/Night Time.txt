Night Time LyricsNight time - turning out the sun
Countdown - pulsing like a machine
Conflict - cars and people, steel on flesh
Night time - desperations sweat on breath
Bloodstains - night covering the crimes
Daytime - shows the face behind the mask
Showtime - law and order life and death
Funtime - a drunken time where all can lie
Come, come with me, we'll run into the night
Come, come and see, sweet madness of night
Night time - party troops and governments
Clubtime - lovers riches promises
No time - running hiding crying tears
It's night time - and time to run from all your fears
