A New Day LyricsYou
You wake up to a new day
Forwards
We move towards a new way, oh
Come with me
Gather with your torches
Singing
Dance by night, we all are strong
A new day, oh, a new day
A new way, oh, a new way
Somewhere the sun shines in the east
A new day, oh, a new day
Touch me
Tell me I'm still human
And wild
We'll run until we run, run long
Our bodies talk, words are lost
Hand in hand we follow
All around
A man becomes the people
A new day, oh, a new day
A new way, oh, a new way
Somewhere the sun shines in the east
A new day, oh, a new day
You
You caught me in your spell
I'm hypnotized
You touched me and now I'm gone
Conflict
Every day the same
I'm wishing
Wishing we could see the way
A new day, oh, a new day
A new way, oh, a new way
Somewhere the sun shines in the east
A new day, oh, a new day
We watch the sun rise in the east
A new day, oh, a new day
A new day, oh, a new day
A new day, oh, a new day
A new day, oh, a new day1Embed
