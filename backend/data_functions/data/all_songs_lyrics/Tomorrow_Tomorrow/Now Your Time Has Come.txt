Now Your Time Has Come LyricsAh, Ah
Every time you call this house don't wake me
Don't you ever climb in here saying take me
Your body's moved, and it looks improved
The company's still the same
And letters from postmen
Star some other person's name, ahh
Magazines the end of me will show you
What type don't like I just might have to grow to
And I'm thinking clear
Because you're not here
Your funeral's marched my dear
Miss visiting elves sincere
But auctions off her, tears, ahh
I was caught and took down to the chamber
Where everybody said that you'd be safer
Where the black widow crawls
Capturin' the cabin fools
The games you, her own rules
And promises she still claims
Mistaken words for twosEmbed
