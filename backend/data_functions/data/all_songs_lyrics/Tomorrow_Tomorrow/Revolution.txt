Revolution LyricsHmm, it's not animal, vegetable or mineral
In Spain you'll sometimes find them
'Ah' you might say, 'he's the beginning'
It changes quickly
But it's a good thing
The answer to the riddle is
Revolution, revolution
Revolution now!
Revolution now!
Revolution now!
Revolution now!
A time will come, when we'll be free
When we can talk and meet and see
(Anything) that's going on
(Everything) right or wrong
Free
Flower children spreading love - a that's a start
You can tell those with a heart
(Sun will rise) it's so nice
(Open eyes) see it twice
Free
Try not to walk about police on your own
Be careful what you say police on the phone
Have your own little revolution
Have your own little revolution
Have your own little revolution now!
Revolution now!
Revolution now!
Revolution now!
Revolution now!
Happiness is hard to find
We just want peace to blow our minds
(Don't you see) other thing
(Bring it in) anything you want to bring
Try not to walk about police on your own
Be careful what you say police on the phone
Have your own little revolution
Have your own little revolution
Have your own little revolution now!
Revolution now!
Revolution now!
Revolution now!
Revolution now!
Revolution now!
Revolution now!Embed
