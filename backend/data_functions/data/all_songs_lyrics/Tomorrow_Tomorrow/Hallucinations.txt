Hallucinations LyricsLight in the sky
Clouds passing by
Top of my window
The sun isn't shy
Gets in my eyes
Must be a rainbow
There's a colour and you caught surprise
It's a deep shade of you in disguise
Rainbow
Every morning
Sometimes at night
A circle of light
Shines on my pillow
And there while I sleep
Colours just creep
And dance through my window
There's a colour and you caught surprised
It's a deep shade of you in disguise
Rainbow
Every morning
Giving me, hallucinations
Trying to block, my circulation
Feeds my brain information
Gives my body new gyrations
Comes up to my expectations
I need those elevations
I'm covered in perspiration
Light in the sky
Clouds passing by
Top of my window
The sun isn't shy
Gets in my eyes
Must be a rainbow
There's a colour and you caught surprised
It's a deep shade of you in disguise
Rainbow
Every morning
Rainbow
Every morning
Rainbow
Every morningEmbed
