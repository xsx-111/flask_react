Real Life Permanent Dream LyricsI don't think I'll be coming past
This way again today
Lots of things have a happened here
I can't really say
She was nice to me but somehow
I don't think It's right
That girl belongs, to someone else
I find this 
I wouldn't stay she begged me
Then she cried and made a scene
I calmed her down and told her
Our relationships a dream
Descriptions in a book told me
This thing would never last
It's just a phase, two people go through
It will easy pass
Now I just go, for walks in sunshine
Breathing cool fresh air
See her face
Touch her skin
I would not dare
My state of mind is pure
Now that I am on my own
It's just a phase two people go through
Out of it I've grown
I feel so much better now
My conscience is so clean
Who wants to get hung-up on
A real life permanent dream
Now I just go, for walks in sunshine
Breathing cool fresh air
See her face
Touch her skin
I would not dare
Who wants to get hung-up on
A real life permanent dream
Who wants to get hung-up on
A real life permanent dreamEmbed
