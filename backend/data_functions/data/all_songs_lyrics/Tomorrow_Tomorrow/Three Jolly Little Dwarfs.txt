Three Jolly Little Dwarfs LyricsThree jolly little dwarfs running round the meadow
The sun is very very bright leaving little shadows
One wears red
One wears green
Another one blue
Are they true?
Three jolly little dwarfs sitting on their toadstools
They're such good company in their house so small
Sitting at home
Feeling so alone
Little short legs
Keeps them warm
Danger lurks
Late at night
But there's no one there in sight
But a sound
Or a light
Can turn their peace to fright
And the giant appears
And a deep noise fills their ears
And his footsteps shake the ground
And their little house falls down
Three jolly little dwarfs running round the meadow
The sun is very very bright leaving little shadows
One wears red
One wears green
One wears blue
Are they true?
Danger lurks
Late at night
But there's no one there in sight
But a sound
Or a light
Can turn their peace to fright
And the giant appears
And a deep noise fills their ears
And his footsteps shake the ground
And their little house falls downEmbed
