My White Bicycle LyricsRidin' all around the streets
Four o'clock and they're all asleep
I'm not tired, and it's so late
Movin' fast everything looks great
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
See that man, he's all alone
Looks so happy but he's far from home
I ring my bell and smile at him
Then I go by his rubbish bin
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
The rain comes down but I don't care
The wind is blowing in my hair
Seagulls flying in the air
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
The lamppost hangs his head in disgrace
Shines no light upon my face
Through the darkness, we still see
My white bicycle and me
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
Policeman shouts but I don't see him
They're one thing I don't believe in
He'll find some charge but it's not thievin'
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)
My white bicycle
(My white bicycle)Embed
