Colonel Brown LyricsColonel Brown, he's retired, and old
He's still looking for his pot, of gold
His house was big but now it's sold
His army coat keeps out the cold
Oh old
Oh oh oh
His dear wife departed
In May last year
The poor fellows broken-hearted
From his moustache hang the tears
Now all his life is souvenirs
Oh
Colonel Brown, isn't on, his feet
A [worn book ?) on his knees, a fire, some sleep
The doctor looked at him to find
There's nothing physical
It's in, his mind
Ah ah ah
He's only pleasure now is
A little photograph
Of his army wedding
Those medals on his uniform
Now  the wood to keep him warm
Ah
And we take him out on Sunday
To the church down in the lane
Colonel Brown sits in his wheelchair
And he tries to pray again1Embed
