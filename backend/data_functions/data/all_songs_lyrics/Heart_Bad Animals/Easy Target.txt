Easy Target LyricsEverytime I hear your voice on the phone
Everytime you leave me so log alone
Everytime I think that my heart's gonna break
You knock at my door, you're back on the make
If your hands were tied
If your eyes were closed
Anyway you dish it out
I just couldn't say no
Easy target
Open season and you are the reason
Easy target
I got caught you are such a good shot now
Easy target
Hard to believe I'm so reckless and naive
Easy target
Easy for me to let you do what you please
Maybe I'm a heartbreak waiting to be
Maybe lady luck is laughing with me
I'm an easy target
Deep in the dark
You took your aim
You hit your mark
If your hands were tied
If your eyes were closed
Any way you dish it out
I just couldn't say no
Easy target
Open season and you are the reason
Easy target
I got caught you are such a good shot now
Easy target
Hard to believe I'm so reckless and naive
Easy target
Easy for me to let you do what you please
