Strangers of the Heart LyricsThrough the mist on the harbor
Dancing lights on the water
Shadows move
I see you smiling again
When I reach out to touch you
Like a ghost looking through me
Sending chills deep into me
Shattered dreams falling like teardrops again
And you make me remember
(Chorus)
Strangers of the heart
Always safe with words unspoken
Strangers of the heart
Don't take chances they'll get broken
No matter where you are
Hear me tonight
I don't want to be strangers at heart
Broken glass of my mirror
Makes my eyes see much clearer
You and I only a whisper away
Never telling each other
Repeat chorus twiceEmbed
