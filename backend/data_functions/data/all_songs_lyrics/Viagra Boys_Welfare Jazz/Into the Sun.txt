Into the Sun Lyrics
What kind of person have I become?
The ghost of an outlaw who was captured and hung
Now that I can see everything the way that it was
Oh, I would do anything to take back the things I have done
Well, I rolled the dice, baby, lost everything that I had
I played around too much, ended up doin' you bad
Now I'm takin' everything and ridin' off into the sun
You'll never see me again if that's all that you truly want

Oh, I'd stop all my ramblin'
And playin' around
I'd stop drinkin' and gamblin'
To earn back your love

If you don't want anything to do with me now
Then there ain't no reason for, for me to stick around
I'll pack all my things and I'll head to the next town
I'll stop all my ramblin', try to settle down
I know that it's over, babе, this much I can see
But I promise I've changed a lot, I'vе destroyed the old me
But if somehow you got a little love for me left
Well, join me tomorrow and we'll ride off into the sunset
Oh, I'd stop all my ramblin'
And playin' around
I'd stop drinkin' and gamblin'
To earn back your love

Into the sun
Into the sun
Into the sunEmbed
