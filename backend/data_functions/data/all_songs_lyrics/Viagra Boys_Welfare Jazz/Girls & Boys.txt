Girls & Boys Lyrics(Girls)
They always try to tie me down
(Boys)
They wanna go out on the town
(Drugs)
The only way I can boogie down
(Love)
Something that I know nothing about
(Girls)
(Boys)
The whole world try to bring me down
(Girls)
But one day I will burn it down
(Drugs)
I'm standing still but spinning 'round
(Girls)
Yeah one day I'ma burn it down
(Dogs)
The only real friends that I've got
(Shrimps)
Abluhblublublubluhblubuhbub
(Love)
Something I know nothing about
(Girls)
They always try to tie me down
(Boys)
This fucked up world keep spinning round'
(Girls)
But one day I'ma burn it down
(Drugs)
Sometimes when I feel so alone
(Girls)
But one day I will burn it down
Down, down, down
(Cops)
They never wanna leave me alone
(Girls)
They want me to pick up my phone
(Boys)
They stay out all night, don't go homе
(Drugs)
They make me feel I'm all alonе
(Dogs)
The only real friends that I've got
(Shrimps)
Abluhblublublubluhblubuhbub
Don't burn it down, don't burn it down
World keep spinning 'round
One day I'ma burn it down
This fucked up world keep spinning 'round
One day I will burn it down
Sometimes when I feel so alone
Well, one day I'ma burn it down
(Hey, I caught that)
(Yeah, they always put me down!)
(Ah! Ooh!)Embed
