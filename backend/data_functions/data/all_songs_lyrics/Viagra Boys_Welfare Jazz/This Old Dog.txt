This Old Dog Lyrics
This old dog of mine don't seem alright
He kicks his leg, he don't seem fine
He drifts away when he close his eyes
I think he's lived another life
I think my dog was once a spy
A double agent in disguise
I think he knows much more than he show
He doesn't chase the balls I throw
I think he knows of what I did
He's watched me close since I was a kid
I think he knows I'm in too deep
He knows what I do when I'm weak
He tells me things but does not speakEmbed
