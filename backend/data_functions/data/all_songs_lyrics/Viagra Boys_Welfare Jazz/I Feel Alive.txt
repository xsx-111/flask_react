I Feel Alive Lyrics
Oh, Jesus Christ, I feel alive
Oh, just last week, I thought that I was gonna die
And I've been clean now for some time
It's been five days since the last time I got high
Well, I'll tell you what it feels just like
The whole damn world can see me smile
I haven't felt like this in quite a while
Feel like a new man, yeah, and such a better guy

Oh, Jesus Christ, I feel alive
Oh, just last week, I thought that I
Was gonna curl up and die
But, baby, now I feel alive (Ugh)

I might go home, make something nice to eat
A little spaghetti with the sauce and the mеat
Then I'm just gonna lay down and watch TV
I might rub one out and then I'll fall asleep
Oh, Jеsus Christ, I feel reborn
I apologize if I'm blowing my own horn

Oh, Jesus Christ, I feel alive
Oh, just last week, I thought that I
Was gonna curl up and die
I tell you what, I feel alive
Oh, Jesus Christ, I wanna cry
No, I no longer wanna die
I tell you what, I feel so clean
I think you know just what I mean
Oh, Jesus Christ

Oh, Jesus Christ, I feel alive (Ah)
Oh, just last night, I thought that I was gonna die
And I've been clean now for some time
It's been three hours since the last time I got high

Oh, Jesus Christ, I feel alive
Oh, just last week, I thought that I
Was gonna curl up and die
I tell you what, I feel alive (I feel alive)
Oh, Jesus Christ, I feel reborn
I apologize if I'm blowing my own horn
I tell you what, I feel so clean
I think you know just what I mean

Oh, Jesus Christ, I feel alive
I feel aliveEmbed
