Creatures Lyrics
Way down under the water
We don't have jobs, yeah, we don't bother
To pay our bills or go to work or get to places on time

Yeah, we just float around close to the bottom
Looking for scrap metal and cans and bottles
We are content with laying on our backs

We are the creatures
We are the creatures
Down at the bottom
(Ooh)

Yeah, we all live under the water
We don't need money, we trade in copper
And stolеn bikes or shiny things with lots of buttons on them

Well, all my friеnds live on the bottom
They never sleep, they don't drink water
They come out late at night and look for things that they might one day need
I used to live there under the water
I couldn't breathe, but I didn't bother
As long as I had some old microchip to keep me up at night

We are the creatures
Down at the bottom
We trade in scrap metal, and
And electronics
We are the creatures
Who steal your copper
We don't sleep, no
No, we never bother

Down at the bottom
Down at the bottom
Way underwater
Underwater
We are the creatures, we're underwater
We are the creatures down at the bottom
We are the creatures who steal your copper
We are the creatures down at the bottom
Down at the bottom
Down at the bottom1Embed
