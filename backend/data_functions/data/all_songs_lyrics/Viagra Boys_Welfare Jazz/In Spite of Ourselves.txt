In Spite of Ourselves Lyrics
She don't like her eggs all runny
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny
She looks down her nose at money
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny

She's my baby, I'm her honey
She's my baby, I'm never gonna let her go

He ain't been laid in a month of Sunday
I caught him once, and he was sniffin' my undies
He ain't too sharp, but he gets things done
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen

He's my baby, I'm his honey
He's my baby, I'm never gonna let him go

She thinks all my jokes are corny
Convict movies make her horny
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
Swears like a sailor when she shaves her legs
She takes a lickin', keeps on tickin'
She takes a lickin', I'm never gonna let her go

He's got more balls than a big brass monkey
A wacked out weirdo, and a lovebug junkie
Sly as a fox, crazy as a loon
Payday comes, and he's a-howlin' at the moon

He's my baby, I don't mean maybe
He's my baby, and I'm his honey
He's my baby, I'm his honey
He's my baby, I'm never gonna let him go

In spite of ourselves
We'll end up a-sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds
Honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses
Right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts
Dancin' in our eyes
She's my baby
I'm his honey
She's my baby
I'm never gonna let you goEmbed
