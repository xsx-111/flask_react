We and Dem Lyrics
We no know how we and dem a-go work this out, oy!
We no know how we and dem a-go work it out

But someone will have to pay
For the innocent blood
That they shed every day
Oh, children, mark my word
It's what the Bible say, yeah! yeah!


But in the beginning Jah created everything (oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh)
Giving man dominion over all things
But now it's too late
You see, men has lost their faith (oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh), hey-ey-hey!
Eating up all the flesh from off the earth, eh!


But I say: we no know how we and dem a-go work it out
Them a flesh and bone!
We no know how we and dem a-go work it out
But we now have no friends
In a high society, yeah!
We no have no friends
Oh, mark my identity
We no have no friends. Oh-oh! Yeah!
