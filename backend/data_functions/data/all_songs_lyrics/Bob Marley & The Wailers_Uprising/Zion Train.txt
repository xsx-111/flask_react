Zion Train Lyrics
Zion train is coming our way
The Zion train is coming our way
Oh, people, get on board! (you better get on board!)
Thank the Lord (praise Fari)
I got to catch a train, Because there is no other station
Then you going in the same direction (ooh-ooh)
Zion's train is coming our way
The Zion's train is coming our way

Which man can save his brother's soul? (save your brother's soul)
Oh man, it's just self control
Don't gain the world and lose your soul (just don't lose your soul)
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
To the bridge (ooh-ooh!)
Oh, where there's a will
There's always a way
Where there's a will
There's always a way (way, way, way, way)
Soul train is coming our way
Zion train is coming our way

Two thousand years of history (history)
Could not be wiped away so easily
Two thousand years of history (Black history)
Could not be wiped so easily (could not be wiped so easily)
Oh, children, Zion train is coming our way
Get on board now!
They said the Zion train is coming our way
You got a ticket, so thank the Lord!
Zion's train is
Zion's train is
Zion's train is
Zion's train is
They said the soul train is coming our way
They said the soul train is coming our wayEmbed
