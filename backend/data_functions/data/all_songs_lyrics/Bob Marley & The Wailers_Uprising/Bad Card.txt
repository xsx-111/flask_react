Bad Card Lyrics
You a-go tired fe see me face
Can't get me out of the race
Oh, man, you said I'm in your place
And then you draw bad card
A-make you draw bad card
And then you draw bad card
Propaganda spreading over my name
Say you want to bring another life to shame
Oh, man, you just a-playing a game
And then you draw bad card (draw bad card)
A-make you draw bad card (draw bad card)
A-make you draw bad card

I want to disturb my neighbor
Because I'm feeling so right!
I want to turn up my disco
Blow them to full watts tonight, eh!
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style

Because we guarding the palace so majestic
Guarding the palace so realistic!
Them a-go tired to see we face (oh yeah!)
Me say them can't get we out of the race
Oh, man, it's just a big disgrace
The way you draw bad card (draw bad card)
The way you make wrong moves (make wrong moves)
The way you draw bad card (draw bad card)
A-make you draw bad card (draw bad card)
A-make you draw bad card
In a rub-a-dub style, rub-a-dub style
In a rub-a-dub style4Embed
