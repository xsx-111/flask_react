Androgyny Lyrics
When everything is going wrong
And you can't see the point of going on
Nothing in life is set in stone
There's nothing that can't be turned around
Nobody wants to feel alone
Everybody wants to love someone
Out of the tree, go pick a plum
Why can't we all just get along?

(Boys) boys in the girl's room
(Girls) girls in the men's room
You free your mind in your androgyny
(Boys) boys in the parlor
(Girls) they're getting harder
I'll free your mind and your androgyny

No sweeter a taste that you could find
Than fruit hanging ripe upon the vine
There's never been an oyster so divine
A river deep that never runs dry
(What you need, what you need, what you need, what you need
What you need, what you need, what you need, what you need)
The birds and the bees they hum along
Like treasures, they twinkle in the sun
Get on board and have some fun
Take what you need to turn you on
(Boys) boys in the girl's room
(Girls) girls in the men's room
You free your mind in your androgyny
(Boys) boys in the parlor
(Girls) they're getting harder
I'll free your mind, I'll free your mind
I'll free your mind, I'll free your

(Boys) Behind closed doors and under stars
(Girls) It doesn't matter where you are
(Boys) Collecting jewels that catch your eyes
(Girls) Don't let a soulmate pass you by

Boys in the girl's room
Girls in the men's room
You free your mind in your androgyny
Boys in the parlor
They're getting harder
I'll free your mind, I'll free your mind
Boys in the girls's room
Girls in the men's room
You free your mind in your androgyny
Boys in the parlor
They're getting harder
I'll free your mind, I'll free your mind
I'll free your mind, I'll free your
Boys, girls
Boys, girls6Embed
