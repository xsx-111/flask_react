Shut Your Mouth Lyrics
Welcome, we love you, we hate you, we love you
We want you, we need you, we wish we were like you
They say you're a saint, you're a whore, you're a sinner
That he had you, he made you, he can't live without you
Would you confess if we asked that you nurture
The urge to declare that it's time
To settle down with a man of your own
You want a baby, a family, a piece of security?

Shut your mouth
Try not to panic
Just shut your mouth
If you can do it
Shut your mouth
Try not to panic
Just shut your mouth
If you can do it
Just shut your mouth

What's your opinion of the dire situation?
In our land here, our guest here, of course you'll be nice here
How do you feel about God and religion?
Are you good people? Bad people?
Guess-it-doesn't-matter people
Your place, my place, make her bring that famous face
You got some? You want some? You wanna let me get you some?
We know your music but of course we'd never buy it
It's too fake, man - right, man!
We don't give a fucking damn!

Shut your mouth
Try not to panic
Just shut your mouth
If you can do it
Shut your mouth
Try not to panic
Just shut your mouth
If you can do it

I hear you saying, "Play it, smart girl
Win the game, love!
Give 'em what they want
What they want to see, and you could be a big star
You could go far
Make a landmark
What have you been reading, you smart girl?
Win the game, love!
Give'em what they want
What they want to see, and you could be a big star
You could go far
Make a landmark
Make a shitload!"
And the world spins by with everybody moaning
Pissing, bitching and everyone is shitting
On their friends, on their love, on their oaths, on their honor
On their graves, out their mouths, and their words say nothing

Shut your mouth
Try not to panic
Just shut your mouth
If you can do it
Shut your mouth
Try not to panic
Just shut your mouth
If you can do it
Just shut your mouth

I waited to say something
Oh, shut your mouth
I wanted to say something
Just shut your mouth
I waited to say something
Oh, shut your mouth
I wanted to be something
Just shut your mouth2Embed
