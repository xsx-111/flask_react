Drive You Home Lyrics
It's funny how, even now
You still support me after all the things that I've done
You're so good to me, waiting patiently
And isn't it sad that you still have to ask if I care

I never said I was perfect
But I can take you away

Walk on shells tonight, can't do right tonight
And you can't say a word 'cause I leap down your throat, so uptight am I

I never said I was perfect
But I can drive you home

I got down on myself, working too hard
Driving myself to death, trying to beat out the faults in my head
What a mess I've made, sure, we all make mistakes
But they see me so large that they think I'm immune to the pain

Walk on shells tonight, can't do right tonight
And you can't say a word 'cause I leap down your throat, so uptight am I
I'm praying for a miracle
But I won't hold my breath
I never said I was perfect
But can you take me homeEmbed
