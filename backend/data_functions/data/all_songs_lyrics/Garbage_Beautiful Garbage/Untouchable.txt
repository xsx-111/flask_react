Untouchable Lyrics
This is nothing new to me, it takes more than what you've got
To frighten me
I'm not scared of you, there’s nothing you can do
Or take from me

Untouchable
You think you're untouchable
You know
No one's untouchable

You're bound to lose the game, there's no one else to blame
You play so safe
And you're not risking enough, you are doomed to be undone
I swear I'll be the one to bring you down

It's all your fault
Cause you got caught

Untouchable
You think you're untouchable
You know
No one's untouchable
It must be nice to be so sure
And never feel insecure
It must feel good to believe
You're always right and you're never wrong
You've got something to say, you say it to my face
And be a man about it
You got a problem with me, don't go behind my back
Just like a baby

Untouchable (Pride comes before)
You think you're untouchable (You take a fall)
You know (You'd best beware)
No one’s untouchable (A woman scorned)
Untouchable (Pride comes before)
You think you're untouchable (You take a fall)
You know (You best beware)
No one's untouchable (A woman scorned)
No one's untouchable

You think you're untouchable
You know, no one's untouchable
No one's untouchable
No one's untouchable
No one's untouchable
No one's untouchable1Embed
