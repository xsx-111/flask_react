Nobody Loves You Lyrics
Watching the days slip by so fast
Knowing our fate has long been cast
Working our fingers to the bone
Cause nobody loves you when you're gone

Coughing up feeling just for you
To find something real to hold on to
But there is a hole inside my heart
Where all of my love comes pouring out

You know you'll always be my man
But grab yourself sweetness where you can
Cause sooner or later we're gonna die
Left to the dogs under the sky

I cracked a piece of broken glass
I cracked a piece of broken glass

Coughing up feeling just for you
To find something real to hold on to
But there is a hole inside my heart
Where waves of my love come tumbling out
You say that all the good is gone
That I have forgotten who I am
Free as a bird, wild as the wind
But somehow I cannot let you in
Someone real
Someone real
Someone real
Someone real
Leaving me for someone real
For someone real
For someone real
 in here
 in here
 in here
 hereEmbed
