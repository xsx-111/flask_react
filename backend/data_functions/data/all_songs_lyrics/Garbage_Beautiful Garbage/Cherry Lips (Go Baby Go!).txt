Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!) Lyrics
She gave you everything she had
But she was young and dumb, she'd just turned 21
She didn't care to hang around
So when the shit came down, why she was nowhere to be found
This life can turn a good girl bad
She was the sweetest thing that you had ever seen

You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide
In physical terms

With your cherry lips and golden curls
You could make grown men gasp when you go walking past them
In your hot pants and high heels
They could not believe that such a body was for real
It seemed like rainbows would appear
Whenever you came near the clouds would disappear
Because you looked just like a girl
Your baby blues would flash and suddenly a spell was cast

You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide
In physical terms
You hold a candle in your heart
You shine the light on hidden parts
You make the whole world wanna dance
You bought yourself a second chance

Go baby, go, go
We're right behind you
Go baby, go, go
Yeah, we're looking at you
Go baby, go, go
Oh, we're right behind you
Go baby, go baby
Yeah, we're right behind you

Go baby, go baby
Oh, we're right behind you
Go baby, go baby
Yeah, we're looking at you
Go baby, go baby
Oh, we're right behind you
Go baby, go baby
Yeah, we're looking at you
You hold a candle in your heart (Go baby, go, go)
You shine the light on hidden parts (Go baby, go, go)
You make the whole world wanna dance (Go baby, go, go)
You bought yourself a second chance (Go baby, go baby, go)
Delicate boy (Go baby, go baby, go)
In the hysterical realm (Go baby, go baby, go)
Of an emotional landslide (Go baby, go baby, go)
In physical terms (Go baby, go, go)

Go
Yeah, we're looking at you
Go baby, go, go
Oh, we're right behind you4Embed
