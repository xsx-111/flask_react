Silence Is Golden Lyrics
If I am silent, then I am not real
If I speak up, then no one will hear
If I wear a mask, there's somewhere to hide

Silence is golden
I have been broken
Safe in my own skin
So nobody wins

If I raise my voice, will someone get hurt?
And if I can't feel, then I won't get touched
If no truths are spoken, then no lies can hide

Silence is golden
I have been broken
Safe in my own skin
So nobody wins
Silence is golden
Nobody gets in
Safe in my own skin
So nobody wins
Did you hear me speak?
Do you understand?
Did you hear my voice?
Will you hold my hand?
Do you understand me?

Won't someone listen?
Nobody gets in
My body's a temple
But nothing is simple
Silence is golden
I have been broken
Something was stolen
Safe in my own skin
Safe in my own skin
Won't someone listen?
My body's a temple
But nothing is simple
My body's a temple
But nothing is simple
Something was stolen
I have been broken
I have been broken
Silence is golden
I have been broken
Safe in my own skinEmbed
