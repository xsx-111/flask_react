Till the Day I Die Lyrics
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die

You walked into the room, the sun hit my eyes
The force you struck me down caught me by surprise
You sprung the mojo and it worked like a charm
I felt invincible with you in my arms

I must confess it can be good to feel pain
Like breaking waves or getting caught in the rain
Playing those games cause we had nothing to do
I was oblivious, I was losing to you

I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die

Holy Jesus, holy rock 'n roll
The more I gave to you, the more you grew bored
And making love became the waging of war
No peace, no tenderness, no fun anymore
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die

I dreamt that I called out your name
You turned your face to me and started to say
Something so beautiful, it hurt deep inside
So I will love you till the day that I die

Farewell, farewell
I'm sure gonna leave you
(I will love you till the day that I die)
Farewell, farewell
I'm sure gonna leave you
(I will love you till the day that I die)
Farewell, farewell
I will love you till the day that I die
I'm sure gonna leave you
(I will love you till the day that I die)
Farewell, farewell
I will love you till the day that I die
I'm sure gonna leave you
(I will love you till the day that I die)
Farewell, farewell
I will love you till the day that I die
I'm sure gonna leave you
(I will love you till the day that I die)
Farewell, farewell
I will love you till the day that I die
I'm sure gonna leave you2Embed
