Parade Lyrics
(KABOOM!)
Get it right, get it right now
Get it right, do it good, get it right now
(KABOOM!)
Get it right, get it right now
Get it right, do it good, get it right now

Oh, let's bomb the factory
That makes all the wannabes
Let's burst all the bubbles
That brainwash the masses

As far as I can tell, it doesn't matter who you are
If you can believe there's something worth fighting for
The colour of an eye, the glory of a sudden view
The baby in your arms, the smile he always shoots at you

Believing in nothing
Makes life so boring
So let's pray for something
To feel good in the morning
As far as I can tell, it doesn't matter who you are
If you can believe, there's something worth fighting for
The colour of an eye, the glory of a sudden view
The baby in your arms, the smile he always shoots at you

(KABOOM!)
Get it right, get it right now
Get it right, do it good, get it right now
(KABOOM!)
Get it right, get it right now
Get it right, do it good, get it right now
(KABOOM!)
(KABOOM!)
(KABOOM!)
(KABOOM!)

Oh doctor, we're dying
There's no use in crying
So live for tomorrow
And do what you have to

As far as I can tell, it doesn't matter who you are
If you can believe, there's something worth fighting for
The colour of an eye, the glory of a sudden view
The baby in your arms, the smile he always shoots at you
Oh, let's pray for something
To feel good in the morning
In the morning
You're alive, do it good, get it right now
In the morning
You're alive, do it good, get it right now
In the morning
You're alive, do it good, get it right now
In the morning
You're alive, do it good, get it right now
In the morning
You're alive, do it good, get it right now
In the morning
You're alive, do it good, get it right now
In the morning
You're alive, do it good, get it right now1Embed
