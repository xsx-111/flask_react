Breaking Up the Girl Lyrics
In a modern culture, my friend you must be careful
They've a million ways to kill you
In this dangerous world thereâ€™s an art to growing old
Taking chances, magic happens

One mistake's all it takes and your life has come undone
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
It's a drag, I know it's hard but you're tearing her apart
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl

I'm afraid that there's much to be afraid of
Here today and gone tomorrow
Don't end up in the gutter just like the one before
You're just the same, such a loser

One mistake's all it takes and your life has come undone
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
It's a drag, I know it's hard but you're tearing her apart
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl

You've got to let her go because you're breaking up
Girl, girl
One mistake's all it takes and your life has come undone
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
It's a drag, I know it's hard but you're tearing her apart
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
Breaking up the girl
Breaking up the girl

Girl, ahEmbed
