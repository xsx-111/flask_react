Acheron Lyrics
This heart-pounding day has finally arrived
All  my living footfalls sigh like the night
Outside  the war between illusion and truth
I found wisdom lain among putrid fruit of
Desperation, cold, wild gift of youth
Urgent  and dead-eyed
Urgent  and dead-eyed

Hate the god
I  don’t believe in
Heaven’s just a part of hell
Hate the one
Who wouldn’t save us
Shikata  ga nai

In the blue mist death has finally closed in
All my gasping words at war with the wind
Worshipping the fear of hell left me lost
I’ve found something for us, souls who have crossed
Charon’s torrent cold spiked black with frost
Ashen and dead-eyed
Ashen and dead-eyed
Hate the god
I don’t believe in
Heaven’s just a part of hell
Hate the one
Who wouldn’t save us
Shikata ga nai

Nothing can be done
I’m no one

He’s my blood
Reflected in mud
Leave my body
Among the poppies
I’m nailed to your flaws
You were my godEmbed
