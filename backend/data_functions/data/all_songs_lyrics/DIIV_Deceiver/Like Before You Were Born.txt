Like Before You Were Born Lyrics
The wind fans deadpan
We  plummet through the wake
Well,  that's my last mistake
Birds land then
Stand and fly astray
They'd  do that anyway

It's  just
Like before you were born
Through  that peaceful moment to
Like before you were born
Like before you were born
Like before you were born

I'm  an old man
I tell that same old sun
"I get it, I've done it, I'm done"
Cars breeze past
Winding through the calm
I guess their lives go on

It's just
Like before you were born
Through that peaceful moment to
Like before you were born
Like before you were born
Like before you were bornEmbed
