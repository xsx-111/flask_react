Between Tides Lyrics
On and on, the clock was wrong
"You've been numb so long"
His words, they lapped an endless rote
"It's gonna rain, build a boat"
On masterstrokes of ebb and flow
Down the drain the current flows
All along the alpenglow
It seems my pain was self-imposed

I'm just waiting for the storm to die out, out
I'm just waiting for the storm to die
I'm just waiting for the storm to die

On and on, in memory
You'll have my company
Mountainbuilding, anodynes
Both in handfuls at a time
I asked the trees why they grow
They said "It's all we know"
I apologize to all I see
For everything I used to be
On and on, the clock was slow
Down the drain, we surely know
How to drink the oceans up
"Better start with a cup"
I'm just waiting for the storm to die outEmbed
