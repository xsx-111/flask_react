Blankenship LyricsArmageddon is a product
And  one we choose to buy
Dwell  on that for a moment
With Paradise on fire
I guess it’s all the way
Blankenship 
Children  lead the cry
You sold them all away
Blankenship 
With thirty years of lies
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Who  sold us the dominion?
Over swine that smell their knife
The vicious creature thin and dying
On a scrap of melting ice
The earth is ownerless
Blankenship
Children lead the cry
You sold them all away
Blankenship
With thirty years of lies
I should have treated you better
Blankenship
The lives you weaponize
You sold them all away
Blankenship
With silver-plated eyes
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Think of your sons and daughters
Laid in ashen water
Sirens louder and louder
Destroy those who destroy the earth1Embed
