For the Guilty Lyrics
Love, revenge
Love, redemption
Rise and fall
Start and stall
Cash and prizes
You heard them say
Are for the guilty
And stay that way
But how are you today?

Curtained in with arms outspread
I was a stranger in our bed
Shut away and getting thin
I was a stranger in my skin
In my skin

Old friends
Consequences
Forgive yourself
Starting now
No matter how
Things may change
Don't turn away
You're present now
But the past is in your blood
I've been curtained in with arms outspread
I was a stranger in our bed
Shut away and getting thin
I was a stranger in my skin
Curtained in with arms outspread
I was a stranger in our bed
Shut away and getting thin
We were both strangers in our skin
In our skinEmbed
