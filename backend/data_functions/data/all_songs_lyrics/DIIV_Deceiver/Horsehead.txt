Horsehead Lyrics
I've seen
The middle of five foot
Airtight walls and
I've told
The setting sun a joke
He laughed his head right off

Horsehead
It's never quite enough
I wanna breathe in
And never breathe back out
Horsehead
I'm never quite enough
I wanna breathe in
And never breathe back out

I sat
In a slump so my shadow
Sat slumped too
I laid among the rocks and stones
Fuck it all

Horsehead
It's never quite enough
I wanna breathe in
And never breathe back out
Horsehead
I'm never quite enough
I wanna breathe in
And never breathe back out
Wake up, throw it all away
If nothing's changed, nothing changes
Wake up, throw it all away
Everything is nothing anyway

We're each the rotten squall
At the center of it all
We're each the rotten squall
At the center of it all
It allEmbed
