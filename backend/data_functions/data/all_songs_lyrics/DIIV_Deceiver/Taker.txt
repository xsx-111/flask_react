Taker Lyrics
You watched my lips make
The  promise I betrayed
The  years I lived in vain
Chasing the pain with pain

Stand down
There's  oil in my name
My  tongue flickers like a wilting flame
Lay it all out
The  path of wreckage that I cut
All in want of what?

Who were you to believe?
Your lying eyes or me?
I  won't let them tie to you
The shit I put you through

Stand down
Stand down
Stand down
Stand down
Stand down
There's oil in my name
My tongue flickers like a wilting flame
Lay it all out
The path of wreckage that I cut
All in want of what?

Stand down
Stand down
Stand down
Stand downEmbed
