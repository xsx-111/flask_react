The Spark Lyrics
Sit at the foot of my bed
She said, "Like a ghost
Watch a boat in a cove
Lose hope, who knows?"
Here there’s a shadow
A girl in the shade
Wants to find someone
So what, who knows?

In our past
We were such a mess
We did our best
Only time will tell
It’s our past
It’s a wreck
We do our best
And the spark will glow

Sit at the foot of my bed
She said, "Like a ghost
Watch a boat in a cove
Lose hope, who knows?"
As summer fades waves carry
Your soft knowing gaze
Marigolds in a row
So what, who knows?
In our past
We were such a mess
We did our best only
Time will tell
It’s our past
It’s a wreck
We do our best and
The spark will glow

Letting go, the lines we tow
Surrender what we thought we know
Letting go, the lines we tow
Tending to the spark up closeEmbed
