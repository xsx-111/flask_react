Skin Game Lyrics
One afterthought on a skin game
"I took it as prescribed"
Vow do no harm, buy the cure
But first you'll buy the disease

I can see you've had some struggles lately
Hey man, I've had mine too

Fighting to get through the door
But I can't live like this anymore
They gave us wings to fly
But then they took away the sky

Well, what you want?
"Serve me"
Sell me to the spoon
I'm cashing in, falling out, tear me down, hang me up
Strung out to please the king in metropolitan's Sackler wing
I can help you, it's how I help myself

I can see you've had some struggles lately
Hey man, I've had mine too
Fighting to get through the door
But I can't live like this anymore
They gave us wings to fly
But then they took away the sky


I wanna be your doll
But I won't be your dog anymore
You gave us wings to fly
But then you took away the sky

Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin
We lived to use and we used to live
Crack a window
Get some life in you
Holding in coughs, hiding my head
"Everybody respects the dead"
I can help you, it's how I help myself
Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin
We lived to use and we used to live
Crack a window
Get some life in meEmbed
