Chapter Four Lyrics
Give me your hand, (Conceived and born was one of light)
Blood is spilt and man will follow
Infernal man (Rain and dark, the other born black night)
Punishment too great to bear

Raise your head and taste the courage (The one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy night

I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I closed my brother's eyes tonight

Give me your hand, (Conceived and born was one of light)
Blood is spilt and man will follow
Infernal man (Rain and dark, the other born black night)
Punishment too great to bear

Raise your head and taste the courage (The one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy night
I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I closed my brother's eyes tonight

It's cold tonight as the clouds turn grey
And from my hands, to my brother's grave
You took his side, you took his gift
Feel the power of a fallen man
Crestfallen man

Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the One
A punishment sent from his hands
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One
Away in this land you must go

Where has he gone? What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit
Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the One
A punishment sent from his hands
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One
Away in this land you must go7Embed
