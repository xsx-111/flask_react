Down Through Lyrics
I walked down the hill, sluggishly and frail
The wind blew hard, hard on me
I imagined it, your ghost white body
Making love with me

I walked down the hill
Found you crying at the windowsill
There lies the bridge of our lost dreams
I want to see it once more before I leave

I still feel the sting in my hand
From when I hit you
I keep your picture tidy and safe in a shrine
And hope that in time, in time, in time

We'll have a house on the shore
That showers my soul
Washes away the violence
That runs in my blood
Drains the pain
That I've caused you down throughEmbed
