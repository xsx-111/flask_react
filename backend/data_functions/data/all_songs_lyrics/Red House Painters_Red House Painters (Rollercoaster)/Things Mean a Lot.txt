Things Mean a Lot Lyrics
A descending climb
My feet can't make the hill
To the top where your house hides
Tomorrow she comes
The one who I've sworn and broke loyally
To take your place in the bed next to me

You threaten to make me dead
And none of this will matter or surface again

Scares you to know that we won't be
Watching the same sun
Or brooding the same thoughts
In the same part of the world

Scares me how you get older
How you forget about each other
Scares me how you get older
How you forget about each other

Things mean a lot at the time
Don't mean nothing later
Things mean a lot at the timeEmbed
