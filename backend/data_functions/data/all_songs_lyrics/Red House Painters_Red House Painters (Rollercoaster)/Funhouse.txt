Funhouse Lyrics
Weight has fallen on me
Like a part of the sky
And life's hell getting up off the floor

Raise the blind and let the day shine in
Out with this grey into air
Darkness tones in our Chinatown home

View of rain clouds from the window
Moving behind the pale of her face
A thousand circus mirrors cannot move a frown

We are the real clowns
And the sun rarely shines our way
And when it does, and when it does
And when it does, and when it does
And when it doesEmbed
