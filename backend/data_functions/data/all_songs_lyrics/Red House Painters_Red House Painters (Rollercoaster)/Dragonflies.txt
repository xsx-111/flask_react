Dragonflies Lyrics
This is the first you've spoke of it
In your black magic house
In a cold damp attic
Two windows stare at us like eyes
Behind them
December's dark, early morning sky
And a couple of dead trees
With their ornamental stars

I thought by now that I figured your head out
Until now I thought I figured your body out
So please help me to understand
Because I love you more than anyone
x2
I wonder in what fields today
You're chasing dragonflies at play
My little lost girl, so far away
x2
This is the first you've
This is the first you've spoke of itEmbed
