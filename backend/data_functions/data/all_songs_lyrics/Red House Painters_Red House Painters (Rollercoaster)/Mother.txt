Mother Lyrics
The way the street looked:
Dim and polluted
So have I felt when I walked upon
The way the air seemed:
Gray fog diluted
So do I feel when I'm breathed upon
Ominous head spoke you ain't so good
Poorly the sow joked
Trashed and words muttered

I want to be mothered
I want you to give
Attention to my belly button
Mother
I want to have
Bobby pins stuck in my ears

And drown away the endless days
Ridding soon the troubled ways
Embedded down with a warm frown
In a wrong and impure dream
Anchored down with a mermaid
In sound halcyon sea
Lure me in her salt
Liquid canyon far beneath
My mother savior
With her goddess touch
Brushes hands through my hairEmbed
