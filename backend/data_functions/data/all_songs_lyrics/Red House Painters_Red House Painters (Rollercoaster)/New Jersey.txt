New Jersey Lyrics
You're an American girl
Redheaded, eyes blank
Living in a freckle on the face of the world

Another dying kid that learned too much too soon
You're not as good as your mom, but you're as good as dead
You're as good as dead, New Jersey ain't the whole world

Which of your shots have sold?
Twenty-nine with your child
Who doesn't give and eats what's left of your young soul

Another dying spark that burned too fast too soon
You're not as bad as your dad, but you're as good as dead
You're as good as dead, New Jersey ain't the whole world

Don't you leave me out here too long
Will you bring me out there too?
Don't you leave me out here too long
Will you bring me out there too?
You're an American girl
Out of line and out of time
A cry for the leading role, your bum childhood stole

A mother tired and stuck in her love-worn bed
You're not as good as your mom, but you're as good as dead
You're as good as dead, New Jersey ain't the whole world

Don't you leave me out here too long
Will you bring me out there too?
Don't you leave me out here too long
Will you bring me out there too?Embed
