Katy Song Lyrics
Some escape some door to open
This path seems the blackest, but I guess it's the soonest
But there in the clearing, I know you'll be wearing
Your young aching smile and waving your hand
Can't go with my heart when I can't feel what's in it
I thought you'd come over but for some reason you didn't
Glass on the pavement under my shoe
Without you is all my life amounts to

A final sleep no words from my cutting
Mouth to your ear or taut wicked pinches
From my fingers to your bitter face
That I can't heal
I know tomorrow you will be
Somewhere in London living with someone
You've got some kind of family there to turn to
And that's more than I could ever give you

A chance for calm, a hope for freedom
Outlet from my cold solitary kingdom
By the forest of our spring stay
Where you walked away
And left a bleeding part of me
Empty and bothered, watching the water
Quiet in the corner, numb and falling through
Without you, what does my life amount to?7Embed
