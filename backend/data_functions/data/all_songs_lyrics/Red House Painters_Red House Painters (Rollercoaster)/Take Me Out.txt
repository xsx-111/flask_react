Take Me Out Lyrics
That sound coming from those holes:
A voice that soars and takes my wounds with it
To levels unknown

If only you could take me out
Instead of back in
To a relationship I don't understand
If only you could take me out
Instead of back in
To myself that's dying within

Your soul pours out of those holes:
Music of this crazy time
When your car crashed
Did your ghost find peace
And together entwine?

If only you could take me out
Instead of back in
To a relationship I don't understand
If only you could take me out
Instead of back in
To myself that's dying withinEmbed
