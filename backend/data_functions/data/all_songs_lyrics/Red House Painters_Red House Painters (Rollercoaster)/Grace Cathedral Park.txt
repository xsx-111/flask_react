Grace Cathedral Park Lyrics
A rare and blistering sun shines down on Grace Cathedral Park
There with you I fear the time when air gets dark
You know I don't spend days like this
Caught up in lost times of youth that I miss

Can almost hear rollercoasters, see sailboats in the sea
Hear noise and screaming, weaving in and out of
Happy music box sounds

But here on the ground
We're so far away from that
Time turned older now

We walked down the hill
I feel the coming on of the fading sun
And I know for sure that you'll never be the one
It's the forbidden moment that we live
That fires our sad escape
And holds passion more than words can say

Tell me, why are you like this?
Are you the same with anyone?
Save me from my sickness and tell me
Why do you treat me like this?
Tell me, why are you like this?
Are you the same with anyone?
Save me from my sickness and tell me
Why are you like this?
Why are you like this?Embed
