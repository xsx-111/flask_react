Mitsubishi Sony Lyrics
That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice 'cause his wind gone
Niggas sound like Reggie
(Already, ran through already
Nigga goin' in, fuck it)

Pray to the pipe, (fuck it) I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow, I'm mindful of size
She chock full of my swipe, like a capsule sealed tight
With that substance you need, start a family tonight
Big body Merc, LED lights and it's all overprice
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in, from the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watching my fence, like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope, got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my my
Get it, get it12Embed
