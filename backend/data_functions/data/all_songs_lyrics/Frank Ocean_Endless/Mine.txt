Mine Lyrics
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don’t have no more new places to go
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don’t have no more new places to go
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don’t have no more new places to go
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don’t have no more new places to go8Embed
