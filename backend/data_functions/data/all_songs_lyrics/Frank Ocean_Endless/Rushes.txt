Rushes Lyrics
Gonna be somebody, oh I follow
Oh and it's so cloudy
Running showers and the mist so fly
Enough time to know, know nothing at all
Oh I see the lines, there's two lines (walls)
You'll live a life anew
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, to be kind
Cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
It's a rush to the head
We've been here before (It's just like the water)
The first time is not the past time
I ain't felt this way in years
First, I was rushing for a wait
This time I'm waiting for a rush
(Oh, help me up off my feet)
Infatuation's your rush
(Help me, help me, help me off my feet, yeah
Do you wish you were me?)
Keep pushing on ‘em, never let ‘em stop (Do you wish you were me?)
All what happens to be, now it happens to me, upon his feet
Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off and on
Bygones but we're still here, ride around in my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel
(What happens to me)
Bet you wish you was me
(You, just you and me)
(I need some help on my feet)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be up to my feet
I wake up feeling weak
Wake me up in a week
(It’s like drivin’ round) (Stroke me, suck me, pipe me down)
(Two is a crowd, quieting down)
(Bite me down, pad me down, do whatever to fly me down)
It don't matter, pipe it down
Two is a crowd, quieting down
What stays and what- what's gone and what's here still
And what's here still
Riding my two wheels
They're gone and you're still here, rid-
They're gone and you're still here, riding my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel39Embed
