Wonderful Wino LyricsL.A. in the summer of '69
I went downtown and bought me some wine
Oh, I drank it down under the table
I said: watch me now
I'm gonna eat the label
Well I'm a wino man
Don't you know I am?
36 - 24, hips about 30
I seen a fine lady
And I started talkin' dirty
Boy, she looked over at me
And she raised her thumb
She said: "Jam down the road
You bum, bum, bum, bum"
I'm a wino man
Don't you know I am?
I went to the country
And while I was gone
I lost control of my body functions
On the road ahead at the ladies front lawn
I'm so ashamed
But I'm a wino man
I can't help myself
I've been drinkin' all night
Till my eyes got red
Stumbled on the gutter
And busted my head
Bugs in my zoot suit
Been scratchin' like a dog
I can't stand no water
And I stink like a hog
Give me a five dollar bill
And an overcoat too
Give me a five dollar bill
And an overcoat too
A five dollar bill and an overcoat too
A five dollar bill and a Florsheim shoeEmbed
