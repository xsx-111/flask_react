Disco Boy LyricsDisco Boy
Run to the toilet, honey
Comb your hair
Disco Boy
Pucker yer lip
'N check yer shoulders
'Cause some dandruff might be
Hiding there!
Disco Boy
You're the DISCO KING!
Aw, the Disco-Thing
Made you think
Someday
That you
Just might GO SOMEWHERE!
Disco Girl!
You're 'out-a-site'!
You need a Disco Boy
To treat you right
He'll do a little dance;
Take you home tonight
(Leave his hair alone
But you can kiss his comb)
Disco Boy!
Run to the toilet boy
'N comb your hair
Disco Boy!
Shake it more than three times 'n yer playin' with it
(WOW!)
While yer standin' there!
(Well...)
Disco Boy!
Do the Bump every night, 'til the Disco Girl
Who's REALLY RIGHT
Gonna fall for yer line
'N feed you a box fulla
Chicken Delight!
Disco chit-chat; so demure!
Pump that booty all across the floor!
A disco drink
A disco wink
"You never go doody!"
(That's what you think)
"You never go doody!"
(That's what you think)
"You never go doody!"
(That's what you think)
Doody
Ah, go doody
Doody
You never go doody
Doody
You never go doody
Doody
You never go doody
Doody
You never go doody
Ah, baby, doody
No doody
Doody
Ah, baby, doody
Disco Boy!
You got one more chance
To comb your hair again
Disco Boy!
They're closin' the bar
And she's leavin' with your friend!
Disco Boy
That's the way it goes
So wipe your nose
'N try it again
To get a little laid tomorrow!
Disco Boy
No one understands
But thank THE LORD
That you still got hands
To help you do that jerkin' that'll
Blot out yer Disco Sorrow!
It's Disco Love tonight
Make sure you look all right
It's Disco Love tonight
Make sure you look all rightEmbed
