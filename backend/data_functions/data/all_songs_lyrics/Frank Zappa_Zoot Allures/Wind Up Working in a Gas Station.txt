Wind Up Working in a Gas Station LyricsThis here song might offend you some
If it does, it's because you're dumb
That's the way it is where I come from
If you been there too, let me see your thumb
Let me see your thumb. (16x)
Show me your thumb if you're really dumb
Show me your thumb if you're really dumb
Show me your thumb if you're really dumb
Show me your thumb if you're dumb
Hey now, better make a decision
Be a moron, and keep your position
You oughta know now, all your education
Won't help you no-how
You're gonna wind up workin' in a gas station
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Pumpin' the gas every night
Pumpin' the gas every night
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Pumpin' the gas every night
Pumpin' the gas every night
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Manny da camper wants to buy some white
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Manny da camper wants to buy some white
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Manny da camper wants to buy some white
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Manny da camper wants to buy some white
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Wind up workin' in a gas station
Wind up workin' in a gas stationEmbed
