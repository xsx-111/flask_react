Back Where You Started Lyrics
Baby, tell me what you're trying to prove
Playing games with my heart
Hey, now listen
I ain't got to take one more night
You're the one who broke the rules
An' I'm the one who played the fool
Now you're trying to tell me, it's alright
You should have known better than to hurt a friend
You'll never get another chance again

You'll be back where you started
I know you won't admit it
But you're brokenhearted
You'll be back where you started
You think it's going to be easy
But it just gets harder, harder, harder, yeah

You had a way with words
One look an' I was under your spell
I didn't know, should I stay, should I run
You can't deny that you told me lies
Love 'em an' leave 'em baby, that's your style
I'm not afraid to take life as it comes
You play with fire, guess you'll never learn
You messed with me baby, going to get burned
You'll be back where you started
An' you know how it feels
When you've been discarded
You'll be back where you started
But you think you got it made
But it won't get you far
No it won't get you far
You'll be back where you started

Who's going to help ya, throw you a lifeline?
I'll tell you one thing, you've really done it this time
You took your one chance an' let it slip away
You never going to let it settle down
The river's gone now all over the town

You'll be back where you started
I know you won't admit it
But you're brokenhearted
You'll be back where you started
You think it's going to be easy
But it just gets harder

You'll be back where you started
An' you know how it feels
When you've been discarded
You'll be back where you started Embed
